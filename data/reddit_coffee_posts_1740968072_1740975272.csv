Ironically, we live in Kenya but the coffees locals can get are nothing like the export grade beauties I am able to pick up when visiting family in the States, or by mail.

I'm hoping to up our coffee experience the best I can, and I'm wondering what the most user friendly brewing device is for a beginner? So far I have my eye on the v60, the switch, and the clever. 

We've been using French press and drip for the most part.

I'm also looking for recommendations for a beginner and budget friendly grinder, as the one we currently have is probably not doing the job.

1j2a6jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2a6jg/why_my_girlfriend_unconsiously_wanting_drink_with/,"Why my girlfriend unconsiously wanting drink with other people, Then it comes to the point that consecutively she choses to please other people specially her coworkers. 2yrs and 3 months relationship. 27F ,26M. Can it be saved or is worth saving and why?","Just to be clear no bias. I need some advise. My gf of 2yrs is not of good financial status. And I am financially stable my self can sustain both of us.

We clearly have good experiences like going out, travelling vacations, Also included her in my family trip(domestic only)

The main topic is here is she unconsiouly want other people to enjoy with(going to the bar), I myself have enough experience in partying and clubbing of course with her permission with my workmates and if she agreed im going with updates and VCall then her friend in college is included in the outside work activities so she have security and eyes.

Her first Bar with her which is I approved of cause I want her to experience things like this her  co workers, mixed of guys and girls.
She did update me but one of his girl co workers did hang up her phone and she didn't call back just a short text and update that she got home. After that we discussed about what all happened there. Also I am comfortable cause 2 guys of her co workers is my college buddies. And she did so much story that she got drunk. I felt she happy and happy for her too.

Then the despida party came. I also approved for a day only.
Then after that it makes thing worst. After she made that mistake (choosing them overnight despidida party which is i approve of ,I know only its a day not overnight prolly 2pm-10pm, on the span of that time i gave her two cautions before staying. And also she did drink and did not disclose. She has a low alcohol tolerance unlike me so I am super concerned. She did go slept in their airbnb room. Shes with their workmates. She sleep probably 12am cause im angry and i also worry for her is she will go home at 12am.

We discusses his workmates is tolerant in terms of adultering specially his boss but still she choses them over me she also said that I'm her priority but I can't feel that im the priority.

She said while we are arguing that she not doing anything wrong while she slip that she enjoyed being with them that she belongs with them and after wards she fought back with my one mistake and make it against me. 

After that I wanting a 3day cool off but I said we'll talk tomorrow, then a day passes she didnt even text me or call me, the second day she said shes hurt and scared to use her phone so she turned it off. I felt abandoned for that one.

Day 3 we tried to talk about my needs and her sides.
We have both shared good experiences and forgiveness for both of us. Pretty much we both agreed that these past months I'm the one that is adjusting too much. After that it was in a coffee shop its 4 hrs we talked our good and bad and I'm ready to break up or cool off wanting, but she cried and she did said that she can accept if i have affair on that time. I'm shocked, I don't have idea to rebutt that cause she did me wrong. But we did talk and communicate our needs but after that I said i will her a chance things going smooth 
, then all of sudden when she felt i'm okay that time she asked again if I will approve of ""them"" going to the Bar.
Then suddenly is shoot up to me like what the hell, I communicated to her that what is our priority based on our Actions and stuff. 
She's unconsiously thinking of going to the Bar with other people not me. Things to like utterly anger,hurt, shock and betrayed.

Then after 4hrs of talking, i did drop her to work shes solo duty so I can stay in the office so I stayed. I google and ask why do your partner choses other people over you and these things popped up
 (Fear of missing out (FOMO):
The desire to experience different things and people can sometimes lead individuals to believe they are ""missing out"" on something by only being with one partner, 

-Unmeet needs in the relationship.

-Low self esteem.

-Attachment issues

But she said FOMO like what F, i got the ick but after that she said she asked my why I am getting the ick of her and i i narrated she said the fomo/personality issues she said she misread the google view it was F2F chatting in her work.

She is still in denial that she choses the fun over me. It is my main issue. Cause it happen thrice in a row about span of 2months.

Well on my part she did still love me. I can't just feel that im her priority cause unconsciously she chose them over me. ( the despedida and the time she asked again will I approve 
""They"" will go to the bar with her conscious self that the point of my anger and frustration right now. 

I'm his first boyfriend tho. Then i have 2 exes. She also knows this.

What's your take my guys out there please free to have a say on this as a man.

my situation is that both of my permanent canines were impacted and my baby canines were still holding on to their spots despite me being 22 lol (how we got here at this point in my life is a whole different story). 

the first step was having my baby canines removed, and a few weeks after that they put my braces on. my one canine had already started to come through my gums pretty significantly so they were able to put a bracket on that one and attach it to my wire with a rubber band (?). 
at my next appointment they attached the bracket on my one canine directly to the wire and exposed my other permanent canine using a laser, and were able to attach a button onto the tiny piece they exposed and once again connect that tooth to my wire using a rubber band. 
at my most recent appointment they were able to get a small bracket on the tiny piece of exposed tooth and attach both of my canines to the wire via a second wire connecting them. 

the biggest difference i‚Äôve noticed aside from the movement of my canines is the difference in my bite (bite turbos). even though the orthodontist told me that i had a deep bite, i never really realized how deep it was until i compared my pictures tonight ü§Ø that‚Äôs what inspired me to make this post, it was like a ‚Äúwow things are actually changing‚Äùmoment.

So, guess what? Flow cytometry‚Äîthe lab technique that's as gloriously complex as pronouncing 'cytometry' after too much caffeine‚Äîjust got a sleek makeover with a fraction of the budget, thanks to AI and the simple elegance of gravity. Picture this: a team from Rice University has leapfrogged the traditional setup of bulky machines that cost more than a lavish wedding, into a nifty, compact device that could easily moonlight as a coffee table accessory. But why the fuss, you ask?

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Accessibility**: Traditional flow cytometers are like the Rolls Royce of labs‚Äîshiny, impressive, but only spotted in the fanciest neighborhoods. This new device flips the narrative, making it feasible for clinics in under-resourced areas to access top-notch cell analysis.
   
2. **Cost**: Imagine the price difference between a boutique artisanal loaf of bread and a supermarket generic loaf. This device cuts costs by ditching expensive pumps for gravity-driven flow‚Äîa genius move akin to realizing you don't need blingy shoe horns to put on slippers.
   
3. **Speed and Accuracy**: With AI muscle, this device counts immune cells‚Äîlike the crucial CD4+ T cells‚Äîsuper fast. Who knew that a neural network could be your new lab BFF, right?

**The Tech Behind the Magic:**

- **Gravity-driven Slug Flow**: A name that sounds like it beamed straight out of a sci-fi novel. This method ensures sample flow at a consistent velocity‚Äîa game-changer for accuracy.
  
- **AI Wizardry**: By training a neural network to spot CD4+ T cells tagged with specific beads, the device performs cell analysis with as much effort as it takes to scroll Instagram.

**What This Means:**

This platform isn't just a one-trick pony; it's a budding circus of potential for other applications in disease diagnosis and biomedical research. It's like discovering your old high school garage band has turned into The Rolling Stones overnight.

**Now Here's The Kicker:**

Does this cost-friendly, AI-packed flow cytometer signal the start of a brave new world of democratized medical diagnostics? Or is it a clever novelty that will face challenges in implementation?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j29vgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j29vgw/wifes_tardiness/,Wife's tardiness,"I (40+M) had to run errands in a different city last week. Wife (40+F) decides to tag along (""couples trip"", leaving kids behind) - but primary objective for her was to meet her friends (we used to live in that city, albeit didn't know each other and have rather different social circles). This was understood, so she had most of her meals planned with her friends.

For context - wife is a huge social extrovert, I'm more introverted and the planner / do-er in our relationship. Together 10+ years. Kids. Usual couple fights about money, habbits, etc. I also feel much more deeply than my mine (family of origin, ruminating personality)

Thursday / Friday - I run errands alone (she was meeting with friends). Had a work dinner Thursday, but we did catch up for lunch Friday. She was out late Friday, and I just went back to the hotel and slept early. On Saturday, we both had our own separate lunches but original plan was to meet up for dinner with my group of friends. Mine started earlier, and as I left, I asked her to hang out post lunch - and then to set a time limit because her lunches can last indefinitely. I asked if 2pm would work, she said 230pm - and I thought that was that.

Went off for lunch - at 217pm, I msged her to ask if she was almost done Silence. I then texted and told her I'd go for coffee with my friend since she was still busy. At 249pm (she's already late), she msgs to say one of her friends was late and just arrived. I reminded her we had already set a time limit and I told her clearly - this is not okay She then says she's going go talk to her friend for another 25 min, then go. I said that's very disrespectful to me and my time.... she then suggests to invite her friend to coffee with us. So at this point, I'm already quite frustrated. She had said we don't spend enough time alone as a couple, and when we do agree to make time, she doesn't prioritize it. So I'm like - go do your time, I don't care anymore...

She asks where i am - I tell her. And she doesn't reply until 330pm. Basically, she took her 25+min to finish that conversation, despite me telling her that's not okay to make me wait. I do not mince words about how upset I am at her. She's now stuck in traffic and as I walk back to the hotel - we have a lengthy text exchange. Summarized below.

*1) she was late, it was ""extenuating circumstances"" as her friend was late - It's not extenuating. Her friend couldn't make it in time because she had other priorities, but you have to go to your next appointment. It's not my problem? If I were in her shoes, I would have said, nice to see you again, but sorry, I have to go. (Context - there was three other friends there, so it's not like the late friend would be left hanging).*

*2) traffic is really bad - I'm not mad that you're late due to traffic. I'm mad because I clearly set a time to meet up (the boundary), she agreed to it, then disregarded it, then clearly chose to violate it (forgot the time, then when told she's late, choses to be even later)*

*3) she thought that we didn't make any ""real"" plans on saturday and that we were spending time together on sunday - no, we had made plans for saturday on saturday morning (since she had no afternoon plans).*

We see each other in the hotel, and I'm pretty incredulous and angry. She apologizes - but honestly, I feel, what's the point at this stage. We've been together for so long, and she knows I'm a stickler for punctuality (which I've become quite relaxed on). I haven't seen her much this entire trip, and she basically prioritizes her tardy friend over an appointment with me. I tell her to not join the dinner with my friends, and go spend time with hers if they are that important to her.

Next morning, she insisting she's already apologized, that I should no longer be mad, and that we should make the most of our time alone together before we head to the airport. To me, that was pretty ironic, because she didn't prioritize our time together the day before? Anyways, I was still mad because she keeps claiming she ""thought it was okay"" despite me telling her very clearly it wasn't. And because she clearly made a choice (whether it was very conscious or not is debatable - she does get lost in conversations...).

I feel like I gave her plenty of leeway, but she just continued to push the boundaries and doesn't really understand what accountability is - owning the mistake, and taking real action to address it. She's always been late, but since we've been together, she's improved (largely because I'm always reminding her to plan for transit times, get ready earlier, etc etc). And then she threw out the ""i can't be 100%"" argument. But I wasn't expecting her to be 100% on her own- she was already late, and I told her to come over now etc - but she clearly made a choice to be even later. Ultimately, she only got back to the hotel at 420 - almost 2 hours after our initially agreed meeting time.

Then comes then ""why are you so cruel, why are you mad at me even though I'm so sorry now. Okay, now I'm mad at you"" - an outcome that I've seen fairly regularly throughout our various fights though... She stomps around, goes out to buy souvenirs, then we ignore each other all the way home on the flight / cab ride. She's still ignoring me. I don't think she's manipulative per se - but she is rather used to getting her way (a permissive father who never says no to anything) and is not the most empathetic..

Advice please?

I am currently going through a re-endodontic treatment for a molar that has an abscess due to a faulty crown. I am due to get a new crown in a couple of weeks.

During this process, while the crown was taken off for the re-endodontic treatment, I noticed a cavity on the molar behind it (the last molar on bottom left) at the gumline. I wanted to get opinion of the experts on this forum on what my steps should be. I am just tired of seeing this despite having a above average dental hygiene routine - brush at least twice, floss, xylitol gum after eating, flouride toothpaste and nano hydroxyapetite tooth powder another time. I don't snore (confirmed by my husband) and I also use mouth tape. I dont eat much sugar or drink soda. I eat very clean whole food diet and I am in good shape. I also drink coffee / tea with a straw.

Since this cavity, I have also started using listerine cool mint mouthwash followed by flouride mouth wash.

I have two questions -

1. While this area is accessible, should I get this cavity filled or remineralize it? I don't want another filling but I also dont want another root canal. Pictures of last molar and X-ray.

2. What am I doing wrong that I am still getting cavities? I noticed that this cavity cannot be access by floss so maybe that is it? 

I am feeling a bit depressed and losing hope so I would appreciate your help!

1j29kze,https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e91b56995942471ea09bca9a95ca8d7f,Action Button Shortcuts that maintain silent mode toggle and Dynamic Island animation,"Made these two shortcuts for myself and a few others. Main reason I‚Äôm sharing is I found a pretty cool way to maintain the use of the action button on newer iPhones as a normal silent mode toggle while also adding a lot more functionality.  i really didn‚Äôt like the action button at first because it felt like I had to choose between using it for cool stuff and making it annoying to silent my phone. it was especially  annoying how the default mute shortcut function doesn‚Äôt have a Dynamic Island animation making it hard to tell if I toggled silent on or off ‚Ä¶ these feel like a happy middle ground that doesn‚Äôt have those compromises 

I‚Äôve been sitting on these for a while so maybe this method is well known but just sharing in case anyone doesn‚Äôt because i love it so much. 

1.) silent mode and contextual flashlight: 
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ecbcd483bcda40bca2fc93de7c2abb79

This one toggles silent like normal unless a focus is on then it toggles the flashlight instead (idea is the focus is sleep mode so the phone is already silented and you‚Äôre likely walking out of your bed in the middle of the night to go get water or something and need flashlight without wanting to look at a bright phone screen) 

2.) silent mode and options menu 

https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e91b56995942471ea09bca9a95ca8d7f

This one is for me and it toggles silent mode unless I select an option from my list then it does that action instead. It also turns the screen to 100 percent brightness (I get really annoyed how iPhones don‚Äôt  have an easy way to lock brightness so I leave I added that so I can quickly get it back to 100 percent I‚Äôm weird I know ). It‚Äôs nice too because if you hit the action button while the phone is sleeping it just toggles the silent mode and doesn‚Äôt display the menu so I can quickly silent my phone while it‚Äôs on the table at work without needing to interact with the screen at all ‚Ä¶.


took the functionality out of my list options for the most part as it has some non shareable stuff but just left the template so maybe it would give some ideas how you can use it. 

Right now what i use it for is: an option to automatically connect to a personal vpn and open the root folder on my NAS so I can access my files/photos anywhere,
it opens my personal password manager also hosted on my nas using similar vpn tunnel 

Uses Bluetooth to unlock my laptop üíª if my phone is within a few feet when I press the button
, 
starts and heats or cools my car depending on weather and connects 

turns on my ember mug to heat my coffee to my desired temperature.

Please let me know if you get any use out of these I‚Äôd love to know more people are using and enjoying them or if you do new  cool things with them :)

1) The game seems a bit frustrating at first bcuz of incomplete tutorials (i legit had to learn how to froth milk from reddit and youtube cuz i didn‚Äôt understand a thing from the actual tutorial)
This will actually become a problem for new players which have no idea about gpgp. It was cuz of gpgp and everyone raving about how good the game gets that i tried so hard to learn. After the learning curve the game def gets good. 
So id suggest making the tutorials better especially frothing milk one.

2) the levelling up taking too much time. This makes the game less engaging and enjoyable (My tip is to wait for the daily quest as they have large xp).

3)coming on to bugs (at least the ones i faced)
     Repeated orders and dialogue 
     After buying ingredients no one order them.
     Decorations disappearing after having brought them.
     New recipes unlocked but no one orders.
     Other bugs i think you know what they are

4) some things i just have a problem with-
      The coffee machine upgrades are not so significant even after spending so much.
       The profit margin is very little.(saw a post where at day 140, we get to earn more than 150) 
       Ways to collect gems is very little. There is no such thing as achievements here which increases ur chances of having more gems.


All in all i do love the game. It is very addictive. I was never so interested in finishing a game like i am for this one. I am hooked.
But there are def a lot of problems. Some big some small. Would like the devs to take these things in account cuz if u are able to work on it. Then ur profit is only going to be more and more players would be interested. It has the potential to become a top game so please improve minor things.
       
If any of you have some thoughts about this please share. Id also like to know how other people are feeling about the game.

Understanding Teeth Whitening: The Basics

Teeth whitening has come a long way in recent years, with **advanced gel formulations** providing remarkable results. The science behind teeth whitening involves breaking down stains and discoloration through active ingredients that penetrate tooth enamel. Most bright white gel teeth whitening kits use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as their primary whitening agent.

1j299bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeoulPlasticSurgery/comments/1j299bx/my_plastic_surgery_journey_in_seoul_south_korea/,"My Plastic Surgery Journey in Seoul, South Korea","# Introduction

I wanted to detail my journey of going to various plastic surgery clinics in Seoul, South Korea. It started in August 2024 with a hair transplant, and then I went down a rabbit hole getting various procedures and revisions at different clinics. This post covers my entire experience up to the present day, including what I plan to do going forward. Hopefully, this will be valuable to anyone considering plastic surgery in Seoul.

I won't discuss my hair transplant in detail since it's not central to the rest of the story. If you want to know where I got the transplant, feel free to comment or DM me, but honestly, it was a pretty small procedure.

# BT Plastic Surgery

The first real procedure I had was at BT Plastic Surgery. BT had excellent reviews on Purseforum and elsewhere. I should have done more thorough research, but the reviews I found were glowing. I've since learned that BT Plastic Surgery used to be high quality, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore, as my experience will attest.

Before settling on BT, I consulted at several clinics, including 345 Plastic Surgery and Nana Plastic Surgery. Nana was by far the worst‚Äîthey wanted to do the opposite of what I wanted, and I'm very glad I didn't go there. I found Nana through Seoul Guide Medical, which I now consider a terrible service, but that's another story entirely.

My consultation at BT actually went well. The facial contouring surgeon said we could shorten my chin (what I wanted) and also advance it a bit. This sounded perfect, and he showed me roughly what he planned to do on my CT scan. The rhinoplasty surgeon examined my nose thoroughly and emphasized how complicated it was. He insisted he could improve my breathing and said, ""Please, if you don't get this surgery done here, get it done somewhere, because your breathing is so bad, your septum is so deviated."" The consultation was comprehensive, with Kelly from BT present throughout (I originally spoke with Grace but was transferred to Kelly).

They quoted a high price‚Äîapproximately 14.5 million Korean won for the rhinoplasty. The genioplasty was cheaper but still above market rate. Kelly seemed surprised when I didn't haggle and actually insisted I negotiate with her. I told her, ""Just tell me the price and I'll pay it. All I want is quality."" But she practically forced me to bargain, which wasn't what I came for. This haggling for surgery prices is apparently common in South Korea but quite different from how things work in the US.

Eventually, we agreed on a price. I paid a deposit, went home to think it over, and later scheduled the surgery.

On the day of surgery, I arrived with a slight sore throat and asked Kelly if it was okay to proceed. She quickly assured me it was fine and rushed me in. Before surgery, I had a very hurried consultation with both doctors. The facial contouring doctor simply said, ""Let's shorten your face."" When I confirmed we'd also be advancing my chin, he agreed but didn't provide any specific measurements or detailed plan. This became significant later. The rhinoplasty surgeon was equally vague, only saying he'd ""fix my nose.""

They put me under general anesthesia, and when I woke up, I was in excruciating pain. All I could say was ""pain, pain, pain."" My face and nose hurt so intensely that I felt like I'd been in a car accident. I later discovered the anesthesiologist hadn't given me any painkillers during the procedure‚Äîonly local anesthesia‚Äîwhich is why my body went into a stress response once I got to the recovery room.

I was in such extreme pain that they gave me some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which barely helped. Fortunately, I had decided to stay overnight at the hospital. About 30 minutes after coming out of anesthesia, while my brother was with me, I started feeling terrible. I checked my pulse and felt my heart racing as if I'd just sprinted. I called for the nurse, who confirmed I had tachycardia and appeared visibly concerned. I requested to see the anesthesiologist, and after some scrambling, they finally came.

I told the anesthesiologist I needed something for my racing heart because I was having a stress response. They eventually administered IV propranolol, after which I immediately threw up blood into a cup. I remained in this terrible condition all night, with my heart rate elevated. Everyone left except for one nurse. I couldn't sleep due to the pain, and the unknown medications they gave me weren't effective.

The next day, I was discharged and went home with a fever. My brother watched over me, clearly worried. I eventually recovered my strength, but those first few days were frightening. I felt much worse than I had anticipated.

A few days later, when I finally got to remove the cast, I was horrified. My nose looked monstrous‚Äîas if a child had shaped it from play-doh. It was crooked, bulbous, with an unnaturally thick bridge. I was in shock, but Kelly kept dismissing my concerns, repeatedly saying, ""It's just swelling, don't worry.""

Weeks passed, and BT's aftercare was practically non-existent. All my questions‚Äîeven medical ones‚Äîwere directed to Kelly, who continued to be dismissive, attributing everything to swelling. By now, it's probably clear that I don't think highly of Kelly. She's a poor representative for BT and terrible at patient communication.

As more weeks passed, my nose remained crooked and bulbous. After several months, when the swelling had subsided, it became obvious this wasn't a temporary issue‚ÄîI now had an ugly nose that was worse than my original one.

# All Heart Plastic Surgery

While dealing with my botched nose job, I went to All Heart Plastic Surgery in Apgujeong. There, I had a platysmaplasty (neck muscle tightening), neck liposuction, upper blepharoplasty with ptosis correction, and canthoplasty on both eyes.

The doctor at All Heart is genuinely nice, but I believe he's relatively young and inexperienced. The platysmaplasty seems to have worked‚Äînow five months post-op, my jaw looks more defined, though not as dramatically as I had hoped. Unfortunately, the eye surgeries completely failed and I needed revision surgery.

# Duhan Plastic Surgery

For my eye revision, I went to Duhan Plastic Surgery. The surgeon there was excellent and did a fantastic job revising the canthoplasties and ptosis corrections on both eyes. While they're not 100% perfect, he clearly has artistic talent.

One important note about Duhan: he doesn't use sedation, so you remain fully conscious throughout the procedure. The local anesthesia injections around the eyes are extremely painful. During the operation, he plays classical music while working like a passionate artist, pulling threads and making adjustments. Although he has a somewhat stern demeanor that might intimidate some patients, he's probably one of the best surgeons I worked with and did excellent work on my eyes.

# Meeting Ryan - The Turning Point

After that surgery, I went home for a bit, but I remained deeply unhappy with my nose. This led me to contact Ryan, a guide who lives in Korea. What makes Ryan different is that he doesn't work for clinics. Unlike services such as Seoul Guide Medical and many others that receive commission fees from clinics (aligning their interests with the clinics rather than patients), Ryan works exclusively for the patient.

Ryan doesn't take payments from clinics, so his only goal is ensuring you have the best experience possible. He charges hourly but is very reasonable with his billing. Going with Ryan actually saved me money in the long run, but more importantly, he completely transformed my experience. He was truly instrumental in navigating the second half of my journey.

If you want to contact Ryan, just DM me and I'll share his WhatsApp. Someone from this subreddit recently reached out to me after having surgery with Ryan's assistance and messaged me afterward to express gratitude for the recommendation.

# RETMUS Plastic Surgery

With Ryan's help, I began the second half of my journey at RETMUS Plastic Surgery. My consultation there was impressive‚Äîthe doctor was confident and spoke excellent English. He explained exactly what he would do with my nose, acknowledging the limitations due to scar tissue (since my BT surgery had been only five months earlier). He was clear that we needed to avoid causing contracture but outlined a specific plan for improvement.

At RETMUS, I also got a philtrum reduction performed endonasally, meaning there's no visible scar beneath my nose. The surgeon made incisions inside my nostrils to shorten my philtrum, which I think has significantly improved my facial balance. He also did a corner lip lift. The scars are still healing after about six weeks, but overall, I'm extremely satisfied with RETMUS. The surgery went smoothly, and I highly recommend this clinic.

Ryan attended all my consultations with RETMUS and my next clinic, helping communicate my wishes to the surgeons, ensuring everything was prepared on surgery day, and reviewing the surgical plan. Having him there was incredibly reassuring‚Äîhe made everything easier and truly felt like a guardian looking out for my interests.

# Zell Plastic Surgery

The final clinic I visited was Zell Plastic Surgery for a forehead reduction. This experience was good but not outstanding‚Äîaround 7 or 8 out of 10. It wasn't as impressive as RETMUS, and the scar along my hairline remains quite visible. I'm also uncertain about how much they actually reduced my forehead. There was definitely some reduction, but not as dramatic as I expected, and the result seems slightly uneven.

Despite these issues, I'm generally satisfied with the outcome. It wasn't botched by any means, but it wasn't the remarkable transformation I got from RETMUS. The surgeon at Zell also performed a temporal brow lift, which is subtle but well-executed. Again, Ryan was there to guide me through this experience.

# Conclusion

That takes me through pretty much all of the clinics I went to. At the beginning, I tried to navigate it on my own‚Äîgoing to different consultations and ultimately getting botched procedures. My nose was particularly disastrous. I don't feel comfortable posting photos publicly, but if you DM me, I might send you blurred images. It was really, really bad.

Everything changed once I stopped trying to manage alone and enlisted Ryan's help. My experience improved dramatically, and now I'm quite pleased with my appearance. I still occasionally consider additional procedures, which has become something of a running joke between Ryan and me‚Äîhe keeps telling me, ""You're done, you're done!""

Based on my experiences, I recommend three clinics: Duhan, RETMUS, and Zell. All Heart has a nice doctor, but he seems to lack experience. As for BT, I would absolutely avoid it‚Äîit's terrible.

Hopefully this helps people considering plastic surgery in Seoul. If you have questions, leave them in the comments or feel free to DM me. I'll be returning to Korea for skin treatments this month and will probably spend a lot of time there this year. So if you're in Seoul, shoot me a message‚Äîmaybe we can meet for coffee. I'd be happy to talk through anything I've learned and help others avoid the bad experiences I had while finding the good options. There's certainly a lot of good in Korea; you just have to sift through the traps.

The story meanders a bit, but I wanted time to flesh out Oliver's personality as a teenager. It's set several years after Heartstopper. Rated G. 

----------------


CHAPTER ONE 

Julio glared at the empty canister in consternation. Were they SERIOUSLY out of coffee? At 7:30 am on a Sunday?! Running out of tea? Never. If the Spring household ran out *tea* it would be cause for a national emergency. Everyone in the house drank tea. Everyone except Julio. He might live in England, but he drank *caf√© con leche*,like any proper Spanish person. This was an OUTRAGE! In his caffeine deprived haze, he wished there was someone there to blame... ""You saw the coffee was empty and you didn't buy more?! *HOW COULD YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE?!*?""

Except Julio was the only one who drank coffee regularly. When you have no one to blame but yourself, solitude is not bliss. 

Julio sighed. Was he really going to traipse out on a rainy Sunday morning in November to buy coffee? Not like he had any other options. Jane was blissfully asleep, and Oliver was out at a sleepover party and probably wouldn't be back until at least noon. It was times like these that he wished Charlie and Tori still lived at home. 

But who was he kidding? Even if they *were* technically living here, Tori wouldn't emerge until at least 10:30, zombie like and non-verbal. And Charlie spent practically every weekend at the Nelson's house since he was 16. 

If he was being brutally honest, what he *really* wanted was for Michael or Nick to live here. If either of his future son-in-laws where in the house they would be reaching for the keys already, cheerfully volunteering to brave the cold without Julio even having to ask. 

His thoughts were interrupted by a key jingling in the front door. Was Oliver home already?! 

The question was immediately answered as he heard his 17 year old stomp into the house, violently kick off his shoes, throw his bag down and stomp up the stairs without a word. Before Julio even had the chance to say ""Hello Oliver-"" the bedroom door upstairs slammed shut violently. 

Well, okay then. 

Julio hovering indecisively at the bottom of the stairs. Something was *definitely* wrong. Teenage Tori stomping up the stairs? Practically a daily occurrence from ages 13 to 18. Teenage Charlie slamming his door? Yawn. But Oliver? Happy, cheerful, enternally optimistic Oliver? What *happened* at the sleepover?

Julio knew they had gotten extremely lucky with Oliver. His older two children had had teenage years fraught with... complications, to say the least. But Oliver had been surprisingly easy. He did well at school (better than Tori, but not as well as Charlie), he had friends (more than Tori, but not as many as Charlie.) He had hobbies (not drums, thank goodness, but keyboard/piano), he loved singing and musical theater, he even enjoyed sports (he preferred football, much to Nick's disappointment). He'd been excited about this sleepover, a mix of nice boys and girls from his friends group. What could possibly have gone wrong to bring him stomping home so early? 

He took a deep breathe. If there was one thing he learned from being Charlie's father, it was not to ignore warning signs and hope things would resolve themselves. He and Jane and made an effort to really be involved in Oliver's life. He sighed and headed upstairs. 

His quite knock went unanswered, so he gently pushed the door open and peeked inside. Oliver lay on his bed with earphones firmly in place, glaring at his ceiling. Julio waved to get his attention, and Oliver glanced over, slowly removing an earbud. 

""Hey Olly... I was just heading out to buy coffee. Would you like to come along?"" He immediately saw Oliver's reluctance, but plowed ahead anyway ""We can stop at Greggs and grab some doughnuts to surprise Mum. What do you think?"" 

Oliver shrugged a shoulder ""Yeah, sure."" He rolled off his bed, shoving his phone and earbuds into his sweatshirt pocket. Julio resisted the urge to remind him to put his earbuds in their case. He'd already lost two pairs over the past year!

The car ride was quiet. The only sound the metronome of the windshield wipers. The grocery store was next door to the bakery, so Julio went to buy the coffee, sending Oliver off with a reminder that his mum liked caramel custard.

Ten minutes later they were back in the car, with Oliver silently chewing on a vegan sausage roll.

""If you won't let me have a pet,"" a 14 year old Oliver had declared, ""I'll show my support for animal rights by becoming a vegetarian."" Jane had rolled her eyes in exasperation, but he had stuck to his guns, and three years later, the Spring household still had no animals, and Oliver still ate no meat. Julio had taken it philosophically. On a scale of difficult teenage issues, a child refusing to eat his Sunday roast was the least of their problems. 

""So... How was the sleepover?""

Oliver shoved the last of the roll into his mouth, and rummaged in the bag for another one.

""Fine.""

Julio repressed a sigh, and stayed quiet. He wondered if he should push, ask more questions, dig for information. Each of his three children were so unique. With Tori, pushing made her shut down completely. She didn't want parental input at all, she would figure things out herself and damn the consequences. (To her credit, she took responsibility when thing failed because she refused to ask for help.) With Charlie Julio learned the hard way that he *had* to pay attention, ask gentle questions, show unwavering support, and urge him to open up. With Oliver he just waited patiently. If he wasn't forthcoming now, Julio would try again later. 

The car ride continued silently. 

--------------



CHAPTER TWO 

Jane appreciated the doughnut, giving Julio a thank you kiss and settling down to read the morning news. Oliver promptly disappeared upstairs, and Julio *FINALLY* brewed his coffee, putting much needed caffeine in his system. He sat across from his wife with his second cup warming his hands. 

""Oliver came home early.""

""Mhm?"" Jane's finger tapped her phone screen as she sipped her tea. 

""I didn't expect him home until noon at least."" Julio continued, and Jane nodded absently, eyes still on the morning news. 

""Jane."" Julio resorted to using his ""we need to talk"" voice. This got his wife's attention, and she lowered her phone while rising her eyebrows questioningly. 

""Did something happen?""

""I don't know. I asked, but he clearly didn't want to talk about it. He left on Saturday in such a good mood. He had been looking forward to Liam's birthday sleepover for a while now. What could have gone wrong?"" 

10 years ago this conversation would never have happened. Julio might have noticed his child's unhappiness, but he wouldn't have mentioned it to Jane, and even if he had, she would have brushed it off. But they were different parents now. Hopefully better ones. Still Jane's answer was similar to what she would have said then, but the intent had changed. 

""We can't *make* him talk to us."" She paused to finish the last bite of doughnut. ""Hopefully he'll come to us if we can help."" 

Julio couldn't argue with her logic, but he still felt unsettled. Like he should be able to figure it out, like some parental Piroit, solving the mystery with only the most tenuous of clues. 20 minutes later, his wife proved to be a maternal Miss Marple when she casually commented while rinsing her mug, ""Charlotte was supposed to be at the sleepover."" 

Oh. *Oh*.

---------------------

 

CHAPTER THREE

""Hey Olly... Mind if I come in?""

Oliver stood up from his keyboard in the corner and wandered to his bed, giving a patented teenager nod/shrug. Julio sat by the desk. The silence stretched for several long moments, and Julio began to wonder if this was a bad idea. 

""Dad, everything is *fine*. Really. I promise. You don't need to hover like a mother hen."" 

Okay, okay... Uh, who dropped you off this morning?""

""Liam's sister Samantha.""

""Is everything okay with you and Liam?"" This was worse then pulling teeth from a chicken. Julio wondered again if he should just get up and leave. 

""Everything is *FINE* with Liam!""

""Okay! Alright... I just wanted you to know I'm here if you want to talk."" Julio stood and headed for the door, but suddenly Oliver spoke. 

""I'm just stupid okay? I just feel really really... stupid."" His voice trailed off, ending in a whisper. 

Julio slowly turned and sat again. 

""And I'm, I dunno... *angry*. Everyone just sat there and stared at me like *I'M* the problem."" He lapses into silence, staring awkwardly out the window.

""Want to talk about it?""

Oliver sighed extravagantly and flopped back onto his bed. ""What's to talk about? You think you know someone. You think you genuinely *like* someone, and then..."" he rubbed his hands through his hair and over his face. ""... and then they open their mouth and something horrible just *falls* out and you realize you don't know them at ALL."" 

Julio waited quitely. He was tempted to say something like ""Oliver your being incredibly cryptic, can you please get to the point?!"" But he DID NOT say that, because this wasn't Julio 's first rodeo, and patience is a virtue. 

""So... you know I mentioned Charlotte before, right?"" 

Yes, Oliver had definitely mentioned Charlotte before. In the oh so casual way that teenagers do when they're *really* interested in someone. Julio knew quite a lot about the girl, despite never meeting her. He knew Oliver had met her at school band practice that September. He knew her nickname was Charli, but Oliver insisted on calling her Charlotte for obvious reasons. He knew she she played flute very well, that she was close with Oliver's friend Elijah's twin sister, and had easily integrated into his friends group. He knew she also enjoyed musical theatre, and liked similar movies and music as his son, she played lacrosse, and had blonde hair and brown eyes (that was from catching a glimpse of her in a group photo Oliver had shown him). He also knew Oliver had a wild crush on her. Not that Oliver actually *said* that, but come on? How obvious could a 17 year old be?! But Julio didn't say any of this, he just nodded. 

""Well... um, it was really late, and we were all hanging out and we started talking about 'Urban Odyssey'."" Julio's brain blanked for a moment. Urban what? Oh yeah, that TV show the kids were all obsessed about. ""Charlotte said she didn't watch it anymore because the 3rd season was trash. I was surprised, since the 3rd season has been nothing but awesome, like they *totally* upped the stakes, and the CGI has gotten better this season. so I just casually said I thought it was great, like no big deal right? She doesn't have to like the show or anything, but I was curious *why*, since she LOVED the first two seasons, and we usually agree on shows and stuff."" Oliver was rambling, but Julio didn't mind, he was already fully invested in this conversation. There was NO way that Oliver had asked Liam's older sister to drive him home early on a Sunday because of an argument over a TV show. 

""So, um, she said she didn't like the romance between Acteon and Leander. And I was like 'that's the best part!', and then she said it was stupid to shoehorn a gay relationship into a story just to pander to the audience.""

*Oh.*

Oliver didn't stop, he was gathering steam and the words began pouring out rapidly ""I couldn't believe it! She literally said ""shoehorn"" and ""pander""! How prentenious can you sound! And she's totally *wrong* because it makes complete sense, the show was OBVIOUSLY building up to this relationship, it wasn't forced at all! And so I said that, and I was kinda thinking she would, you know, clarify? And maybe I was, I dunno, misunderstanding her intent? You know, benefit of the doubt and all that, right?  But THEN,"" Oliver was gesturing wildly by this point, ""THEN she said she didn't know why every time there was two hot guys on screen they had to make them kiss, and it was gross."" He abruptly dropped his hands to his sides and fell silent.

""That's what she literally said. 'It's so gross.'"" 

Julio stood and crossed the room to sit on the edge of the bed, placing a comforting hand on his son's knee. Oliver tossed his forearm over his eyes and continued. ""And then *I* said ""Well, I'm glad I know to never invite you over to my house. I'd hate for my brother to kiss his boyfriend in front of you and gross you out."" And it got really quite and really awkward."" Oliver uncovered his eyes and looked at his father. ""No one said anything. No one backed me up. All six of them just *sat* there. It was already passed 1 am, so I couldn't just *leave*. I got up and went to my sleeping bag, and... whatever. I'm surprised I managed to fall asleep at all. I woke up around 6, and everyone was still sleeping. I packed up, and just sat in the kitchen. Samantha works weekends, and she was up at 7, and offered to drive me home on her way to work. So yeah... That's what happened.""

Julio took a deep breath. That was a LOT to unpack, and he didn't know where to start exactly. ""Have you spoken to any of your friends yet?""

""Um... no. Liam texted, and Angela. Eli tried to call, but I didn't pick up. Liam and Angela actually apologized nicely. But I feel so STUPID. Who ARE these people?! They all know Charlie! Most of them have met him, some have even met Nick! They all know I'm part of the Pride Club at school! Hell, *Angela* is part of the Pride Club, why didn't she say something?! Why did everyone just sit there?! And I'm pretty sure I mentioned Charlie to Charlotte in the past. Like, maybe I never mentioned he's gay, I dunno. I don't usually think about it. It's not a big deal.""

""Maybe it's a good thing you didn't."" Oliver looked at his father quizzically. ""Well, if she had know she might not have said anything. She might not have revealed her honest opinion. It better to know now than later."" 

""Yeah... I guess your right."" Oliver threw his arm over his eyes again. ""I feel so stupid, cuz, I really liked her, you know? I was planning on asking her out. I was kinda hoping..."" his voices trailed off. ""Well, it doesn't matter anymore. *That's* definitely never happening."" He took a deep breath, pausing for several moments. Julio gently stroked his knee, back and forth, back and forth. 

""You know, Nick and Charlie, and Tori and Michael, they can be kinda.. frustrating sometimes, you know?"" Julio felt a bit of mental whiplash at the sudden change in topic. 

""What do you mean?"" 

""Charlie met Nick when he was only 14, and Tori met Michael not much later. And they're all so... perfect together. Tori and Michael aren't so bad I guess, but Nick and Charlie are so disgustingly in love it makes me want to puke sometimes. They all met in high school! They literally met their soulmates in freakin' *High School*. Like, I *know* it's really uncommon, and I *know* straight guys are supposed to want to date lots of different girls before getting serious, and I even know the whole concept of 'soulmates' is probably bullshit, but..."" he rolled over abruptly, burrowing his head in his pillow. ""Ugh! I just feel so *STUPID*!!!""

*Oh*.

It wasn't just the homophobia, and it wasn't just the failed crush, it was more than that. Oliver would be graduating in half a year, and that fairytale romance his siblings are been privy to was slipping farther away from his grasp by the day. He was right, his siblings' relationships *weren't* common. Julio didn't know what to say about that topic exactly, but he DID know what to say in regards to the earlier issue with the TV show. 

""I'm really proud of you, Oliver.""

""Ugh, Dad. Stop."" Oliver lifted his face from the pillow, and although Julio couldn't see his face, but he knew he was definitely rolling his eyes. 

""No, seriously. I'm really, really proud of you. You saw bigotry and you didn't stay quiet. You stood up for what was right, even if it was awkward and uncomfortable. I don't know if I would have had the strength of character to do the same when I was your age."" 

""That's because you were too busy hunting wooly mammoth."" 

""I'll have you know, I'm not THAT old. I was writing cuneiform on clay tablets like all the cool Mesopotamian kids."" 

Oliver sighed and rolled over. ""It's fine Dad. I mean, thanks... but I feel like I did the bare minimum. And I kinda feel like a coward for running away in the morning. I just really didn't want to see any of them, and I didn't want to deal with the awkwardness."" He sat up, resting his arms on his knees. ""And what do I say on Monday?""

""I don't think *you* need to say anything. *They* need to apologize, and act like decent human beings and good friends. I think they will. You've known them all for years. Well, all of them except Charlotte. You know they're not homophobic under usual circumstances, right?""

""Right. But what about when we all hang out? It's going to be so awkward if she's there.""

""She said something pretty horrible, but she's also really young. You all are. It's not an excuse, but hopefully this will be a wake up call for her, to mature and realize how messed up her views are. Don't hold a grudge. If she honestly apologizes and tries to be better, maybe you can salvage the friendship. If she digs in her heels, or acts even more homophobic... well, it's only a few more months until graduation, you can avoid her until then, right?"" 

""I guess... Not sure I'm interested in being friends anymore, but if she tries to be better, I guess I can tolerate hanging out around her."" They sat silently side by side for several moments, then Oliver stood abruptly. ""I'm kinda thirsty.""

""Okay."" Julio stood up as well, reaching out to touch his son's shoulder, ""By the way, you could have called, okay? If you're ever somewhere, and you feel uncomfortable, I don't care what time it is, you can always call, and either me or your mum will come get you."" Oliver ducked his head awkwardly, and shoved his hands in his sweatshirt pocket.

""Thanks Dad, I-"" He broke off suddenly, and began rummaging around in the pocket with a desperate look growing on his face, ""Uh oh.""

""Seriously, Oliver?! That's the 3rd pair this year!""

I wasn‚Äôt fully committed to searching again yet, haha. Out of 3 people I talked with, one sent an incredible message so we moved off site.

- Coffee M&G set for a couple days later. No crazy expectations, nice and relaxed. He made the effort and battled crazy traffic to meet. Great connection and conversation. Neither of us saw the time pass. Sent a text afterward asking if he could send a little gift. Totally unexpected, and very much appreciated. 

- We both realized we were free that night, so I proposed dinner to continue the great conversation. (yes, twice in one day ü§£) Again, no expectations and I genuinely wanted to know him more. This time I showed effort, and drove to him (showing effort is huge ladies). We had such a relaxed and easy time together. He again sent another, unexpected, larger gift while I was on my way home with cute and thoughtful little notes attached. 

- Got home and we were ready to have the where do we see this going and financial expectations discussion. We both have the same idea of what our relationship would ideally look like. I asked him to lead the allowance discussion when he brought it up, and he did flawlessly. I appreciated that a lot! 

We both are super happy with each other so far and the expectations. Sometimes taking things easy, having no expectations at the date and going with the flow is where it‚Äôs at. Know what you want so you‚Äôre not wasting your time on people that don‚Äôt check your boxes. It doesn‚Äôt have to be glitz and glamour from day one. Make an effort ladies, be patient, meet someone you‚Äôre genuinely interested in and excited to meet, accept that coffee M&G.

1j296dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1j296dn/different/,Different,"Valyria didn‚Äôt expect to see him again.

The coffee shop had always been her quiet escape‚Äîa sanctuary where she could enjoy her iced caramel coffee and sink into the kind of stories that made her toes curl. A place where the world outside faded, leaving only the soft hum of conversation, the rich scent of espresso, and the occasional hiss of steaming milk from behind the counter.

But ever since that first meeting, a small part of her had wondered if she‚Äôd run into Riven again.

And now, here he was.

He was sitting in the same spot, tucked away near the window where the afternoon light spilled in golden and warm. His book lay open in front of him, one hand resting on the pages while his fingers drummed absently against the cover. His dark hair was slightly tousled, like he‚Äôd run his hands through it one too many times, and the faint crease between his brows suggested he was completely lost in whatever world had pulled him in.

For a moment, Valyria just watched him. He had an intensity about him‚Äînot in an overbearing way, but in the way his presence seemed to hum quietly, like a song playing just beneath the surface. He wasn‚Äôt just reading; he was absorbing, thinking, feeling.

The corner of her lips curled.

She grabbed her drink and made her way over, sliding into the seat across from him without asking.

‚ÄúYou always look like you‚Äôre solving the mysteries of the universe when you read,‚Äù she teased, swirling the ice in her cup.

Riven startled, blinking up at her as if pulled too suddenly from another world. But then recognition softened his expression, his eyes flickering with something warmer. ‚ÄúValyria.‚Äù

His voice was low, a little surprised but not unwelcome. He sat up slightly, adjusting the way he held his book.

She rested her elbow on the table, tilting her head. ‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs got you looking so intense?‚Äù

He exhaled, glancing down at his book before flipping it closed with careful fingers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about astronauts.‚Äù

Valyria raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúAstronauts?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, kind of.‚Äù His fingers tapped the cover again, a restless motion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about isolation. The way space changes a person‚Äîmentally, emotionally. There‚Äôs this part where the main character realizes that no matter how much time passes on Earth, he‚Äôll never experience time the same way again.‚Äù His voice gained a quiet momentum, and for the first time, Valyria saw what he looked like when he got lost in his own thoughts. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

Riven stopped abruptly, his expression shifting. His fingers stilled.

He let out a short breath, shoulders tensing as if suddenly aware he‚Äôd been rambling. ‚ÄúSorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù

Her voice was smooth but firm, and his eyes snapped back to hers.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù he asked, his brows drawing together slightly.

‚ÄúApologize.‚Äù Valyria took a slow sip of her coffee, watching him over the rim. ‚ÄúI like hearing people talk about the things they love.‚Äù

Something in him hesitated, as if he wasn‚Äôt sure whether to believe her. Like he‚Äôd been told too many times before that he talked too much, that he should rein himself in.

She leaned forward slightly, propping her chin on her palm. ‚ÄúGo on. What happens next?‚Äù

Riven‚Äôs lips parted slightly, but no words came out right away. A beat passed, then another. And then, finally, something shifted in his expression. He exhaled, his shoulders loosening just a fraction.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ different,‚Äù he murmured, studying her like she was some rare celestial body he hadn‚Äôt quite figured out yet.

Valyria smirked. ‚ÄúGood different?‚Äù

A flicker of warmth passed through his gaze, something cautious but unmistakably real.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said quietly.

For a long moment, they simply existed in the space between words‚Äîthe low hum of the coffee shop around them, the scent of roasted beans and caramel in the air. But the only thing Valyria really noticed was the way Riven was looking at her now.

**A little about me:**

* Love spending my free time at cozy coffee shops ‚òï, indulging in some PC gaming üéÆ, and taking road trips üöó when I get the chance.
* Nightshifter. So I'm more active at night time
* I also enjoy those spontaneous outdoor coffee dates (parking lot vibes are underrated, right? ‚òÄÔ∏è) and am passionate about camping, though I don‚Äôt get to do it often enough.
* One of my favorite things to do is witness the beauty of city lights at night while sipping on a hot cup of coffee ‚Äì it‚Äôs a simple pleasure I truly cherish. üåÉ‚ú®
* I‚Äôm a big fan of simple yet meaningful experiences ‚Äì just taking time to enjoy life, even the small moments.
* I'm from the South side of Luzon, so I'd prefer to meet someone who's near or within the area. üòä
* When it comes to faith, I‚Äôm open-minded but I‚Äôd prefer not to be involved with any cultish or overly restrictive religious practices. (alam nyo na ibig kong sabihin)
* Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt work out regularly ‚Äì I‚Äôm more into enjoying life‚Äôs simple pleasures than hitting the gym.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* You‚Äôre single (this is a non-negotiable for me) and ideally financially independent or working.
* I don‚Äôt have strict preferences when it comes to looks, as long as you're confident and comfortable with yourself. I truly believe confidence is key.
* On a personal note, I‚Äôm more inclined toward someone who **isn‚Äôt into the chubby side** *(I hope that doesn‚Äôt sound harsh, just my preference).*

I‚Äôm all about building something real, meaningful, and lasting. If you enjoy simple pleasures like a peaceful road trip, coffee dates, or just having good conversations under the stars, we might just vibe well together. üåü

One autumn morning
I woke up wanting a coffee
A spoonful of chocolate
A spoonful of sugar and coffee, a little water
And milk to top it off
Mix everything and ready for the day to begin

I took my cup and my day began
I went out to some places and met her early
A little chat, a normal exchange of words
Did the sugar change my heart rate?
Or did something about her call me?
A farewell, a handshake
And we continued on our way

It seems the coffee made me sick
Because my heart feels like it's going to explode
Even my mind was in the clouds
Because of my possible discomfort

For days we began to meet
And with little chats and greetings a friendship began to form
Her friends, I mine; We weren't much of a talker
One day, after 3 weeks spent
We decided to go out for a walk
And enjoy a small meal

I got up early, wanting a coffee
A spoonful of chocolate
A spoonful of sugar and coffee, a little water
And milk to the top

I brought my cup with which I usually drink my coffee
I brought her some food for a snack
She enjoyed everything and I just stayed to watch
When I gave her a taste of my coffee
It seems she loved it
And for the next time she asked me for another cup of coffee

That same afternoon I realized something
Something that made that even though I had had coffee
My heart was crushed
And my mind bothered me

I got up wanting a coffee
A spoonful of chocolate
A spoonful of sugar and coffee, a little water
And milk to the top
Mix everything and ready for the day to begin

At that moment I was finally able to understand
That she wouldn't love it as much

1j28zsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1j28zsk/i_hate_myself/,I hate myself,"I've recently began actual concentrated efforts to starve myself into being crazy thin.  I've hated my fat gut since I was 11 and am now 17 but I've never really done anything until three weeks ago when I began to eat less than I should for four days, then for the next week and a half-ish I ate too much and gained my weight back.  Now for 5 days I'm eating next to nothing, drinking a ton of coffee, and exercising too much. 

I don't know how to feel about this.  I hate myself, so it makes me happy in some sense.  I feel more accomplished kind of.  I feel very disconnected from everything.  I feel depressed not because of my new behavior but just because of being me.  I honestly feel completely separated from whatever human I was and am meant to be.  The keys don't even feel real as I type this.  I also feel like a fake because people have actual problems with EDs and then there's me, a moron.  I'm really not even upset about my behaviors now, I almost feel happier or something but I also feel like I'm dissociating from myself more than normal.  I'm mainly just upset because I know the development of these behaviors just means my mental health still is continuing to worsen.  I thought maybe it had reached bedrock but clearly not.  I'm sorry for posting this, I just really don't know what to do.  

I honestly know at this point I won't stop until I at least look like I have something wrong with me.  I'm concerned at that point I would never come back to normal eating habits though.  I probably deserve whatever happens to me.  ",8,1740971040.0,EDAnonymous,2,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j28wkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1j28wkl/healed_gastritis_journey_and_food_diary/,Healed Gastritis - Journey and Food Diary,"TL;DR - I'm sharing my journey with gastritis. I'm sharing my experience, and my food log. I warn you that I got all tests done, including endoscopy, colonscopy, gall bladder ultrasound etc. but nothing was found. I'm decently educated and I have done my research to conclude early on it was gastritis. It took 8 months to get to 80% normal, 10 months for me to get back to 95% normal, and 11 months to get to 100% normal (where I am eating super tasty food again). My wife had gastritis 3 months after I did (much milder case) and she is now fully fixed too (in 5 months).



\[Reddit only lets me post 40,000 character. Here's the rest - [https://pastebin.com/raw/MAvMAN5S](https://pastebin.com/raw/MAvMAN5S) \]



My Motivation behind sharing this - The reason I'm writing this is to give a concrete data point to others going through gastritis. Most of my days in 2024 were spent on this subreddit refreshing and hoping to find encouraging ""healed"" stories. This subreddit was the only thing that helped (along with the Gastritis healing guide book). I thank all the kind people who had shared their own stories. I did not want to share mine till I was fully healed (if that ever happened), then life got very busy for a few months. I am now sharing my story. It is not tell you that everything is going to be alright with you, it is to tell you that ""majority of the people will be fine and all they need is time"". Whether you fall in that ""majority"" or not is something only time can tell. I know that's probably not helpful but I am rooting for you to be in that majority. Eat simple and chalk the year up as a ""stomach health year"". Do not make temporary ""I will heal fast and then life is back to normal"" plans. It might happen but do not count on it. Just focus on eating the same boring (and tasty with a different perspective) food over and over again.





Overall Trajectory - Before anyting, I would like to clarify that I was under no stress at all. In fact, I was in the most stress free state of my life when this started. My case was odd where first a general physician doctor thought it was constipation and kept giving me constipation meds (when I had no food going in), then gastroenterologist couldn't find any ulcers or inflammation (gastritis) in my stomach lining. At that point we were even worried if it could be Mesenteric Ischemia (Chronic, not Acute - which would mean pretty serious condition pretty fast). We eliminated everything but by the end of second month I was very sure it had to be gastritis which was not very visible (maybe in the folds of the lining). There is nothing I can say to corroborate my hypothesis except that I ""felt"" it based on daily symptoms or oddities (for example - I had no issues when eating sugary liquids like apple juice without any fiber or pulp and many such things that gave me confidence).





Overall Take Away - Keep eating simple (boiled, mush, steamed, only salt seasoning) for months (10 months for me) till you feel comfortable (after 3 or 4 months minimum) to change one part of the daily food routine. If that doesn't go well, then keep eating simple till it does. If that does go well, wait for a week or two to change another part of your daily food routine. Just blindly believe that it will all be ok and carry on with other things in life (very difficult, I know). Please do not forget to get all medical checkups and tests done to ensure you are not missing any major diagnosis. However, in the absence of any diagnosis do not get obsessed with the idea of finding one. I was super down till March and thought this will never end or end badly. Then I was super up in May when I thought I was very close to getting fixed but then at the end of the month I thought I don't know where I am or if I will ever be ok. Then I just accepted that my life is going to be this mundane routine (maybe forever) and kept avoiding any thoughts about it. Somehow the time passed and October is when some normalcy came back for me.







Request - This is obviously a throwaway account and I do not intend to keep using it and hence won't be able to reply to everyone. If your fellow gastritis subreddit users are asking a question and if you happen to have read the answer here in the post or the comments, please answer them. It will help them. If there is genuinely something missing then I will try and answer (Others have to upvote the comment for me to know that its an important question).







Story Time - 

=============

How it started

\--------------

Background: I've never had any stomach issues (except for occassional constipation). I am generally healthy and work out though I hadn't worked out for 1.5 years before this and I was a bit chubby when this started. I was 84 Kgs on January 1st, 2024 and my height is 5ft9in. Non smoker, almost non-drinker. I'm South Asian.



Starting: Last week of December 2023, I went out to eat pretty much every day. I had great spicy thai food (very high spice level), the next day I had spicy dumplings for dinner, then after 2 nights on the 31st of December 2023 I had great (not very spicy) Indian food. That night I had two glasses of wine with lindt chocolates. I had stopped drinking for the whole year prior and I was never a singificant drinker anyway, not more than a glass occassionally. On January 1st 2024, I decided to get back into gym routing and cut a few kilos. I started drinking 4 to 5 cups of black coffee a day, I loved black coffee. I also started drinking 2 full spoons of Metamucil. I fasted the whole day and at night I ate a light dinner and laid down on the couch watching TV. I then ate 8 or 9 lindt and Godiva chocolates. I don't remember feeling anything then. On January 2nd, I ate salad for lunch from a very famous salad place in North America. The salad was very tangy. I then drank tonnes of black coffee. At night, I had the same kind of dinner and chocolates. That night I felt a little something but I didn't think it was anything. January 3rd - I do not recall anything from this day, it was just another day. On January 4th, I went to a dentist to get my cavity fixed, at some point the assistant wasn't suctioning stuff so I gulped some of the stuff (don't know what it was). At night I had some medium spicy food and then had some chocolates. By 10pm that day I had this insane bloating (not the gassy kind), it was like a rock in my stomach that's about to rip my stomach open. I kept walking almost 2 hours and going to the toilet hoping some gas/farts would come out and something would improve. Nothing happened. I tried sleeping it off but the pain was just too much, I kept squirming in my bed till 1pm or some time and I fell asleep. The next morning on January 5th, I decided I'm not going to eat anything for the day and give my stomach a rest. 



On January 6th, I decided to eat only a little but tasty Okras (spicy). I had the food at about 12pm and 45 minutes later my stomach started to tense up and the rock feeling started to appear. The rock feeling slowly started aggravating to this very very bad painful feeling of grinding in my stomach along where I could not even breathe and I thought the best I can do is to lay down. Laying down on the couch in the middle of the day for 6 hours straight mumbling ""what's happning to me? aaaaah aaah"" and barely able to keep my eyes open turning side to side. I remember those hours so vividly even a year later. Exactly the same experience on January 7th and January 8th. Exactly 45 mins to 1 hour after eating, and exactly for 6 to 7 hours. It felt like I got shot in the stomach or something similar (on a pain scale). I went to the doctor on the 8th (before the pain episode) when he explained this could be Eosinophilic Gastritis or something like that. Soon after that (in a few days) he zeroed in on constipation (which I kept telling him could not be the case since I stopped eating food and had full bowel movements days prior).



Another day I remember was January 17th, 10 days since I had any significant food. I decided I will try very little rice with very little potato fries (50 gms or so). I had it at 7pm and my pain episode (worse than January 8th) lasted till 3 am in the morning and was so much more acidic (yes, in the stomach, I felt a lot of acid being released) and painful compared to the episodes before.



From January 9th to January 26th, the only thing I ingested was 2 to 5 glasses of watermelon juice. By January 22nd or so, my weight had dropped 7 kilos to 77 Kgs. With some luck, my GP doctor had moved to another country and this new young GP doctor started brainstorming diagnosis and referred me to Gastroenterologist who quickly scheduled an urgent endoscopy and colonscopy since I told him I likely won't be able to last till a later appointment (2-3 weeks later). The same day, Gasteroenterologist told me he didn't find any inflammation and definitely no ulcers but he took biopsy. Before the procedure I told him that I suspect something is off near duodenum since it takes 45 mins to 1 hour for the pain to trigger. A month later when the biopsy results came back, it showed no inflammation. Nothing was medically wrong.



January 27th onwards I was able to digest white rice, and then slowly potatoes. February was majorly a potatoes and rice month. By mid February I thought I was recovering. February 16th was another very painful and odd day when the pain started right after dinner after I thought I had found a cure (drinking banana smoothie with just water right as heaviness in my stomach starts). That night and the day after I was fully lost and I did not know whether anything was every going to improve or if I will even be ok.



By mid-March, my weight had dropped to 70 Kgs and I was in a full blown panic. We typically need 1800-2000 calories to maintain or weight (because of Basal Metabolic Rate) and I was unable to get even 1000 calories even after stuffing myself with tonnes of rice and potatoes. I was eating 650g of food for lunch and 650g for dinner. It was insane! You should not overload your stomach with that kind of weight but I had no choice since I wasn't getting enough calories. I had to find a way to get more calorie dense foods in my stomach. Some time after a few months, very purposefully, I started adding oil, almonds and other things and my weight stabalized at 67 Kgs, and that's where it was till October. By November I had bounced back to 69 Kgs and now that I am eating normally, I am struggling to keep my weight down.



The overall positive part of this entirely horrendous experience was that I started absolutely loving eating very very plain food with nothing but salt and boiled veggies and beans (no seasoning at all in anything). I feel ""clean"" eating that. Now my mantra is to eat fun/tasty food 2 days of the 7 days and the rest of the 5 days are very plain. If you are wondering - yes, I am eating everything I used to eat before this whole thing.





Medications

\------------

On or around January 8th, my GP doctor put me on Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day (slow release). The GP asked me if it helped after 5 days and told me ""oh it should have worked but since it is not working its probably not gastic acid related"" (no kidding, he really said that). If you research, you'll know that Pantoprazole takes 5 days to even ""start"" reducing the stomach acid. I took that for about 30 days but no improvement, my burps had increased significantly (or maybe I started noticing my burps then) and it also used to feel weird (I don't exactly remember but an upward pressure near the junction). After a month, my Gastroenterologist suggested I try Dexilant 60mg (similar to Pantoprazole but brand name) and I think that worked much better for me.



But I cannot stress this enough - I felt wayyyy better after I got off of Pantoprazole and Dexilant. I think they definitely were helpful in giving stomach a break and healing during the first 2-3 weeks, which I think is absolutely crucial, but it I kept feeling awful while I was on them till first week of March. My doctor suggested quitting cold turkey but I started alternating between that and Pepcid 20 mg (and later Pepcid 10mg). I think I remember feeling Pepcid was suiting me better. I about a week into alternating, I decided to quit altogether (or alternate between nothing and pepcid). Overall, I did not have any major issues getting off of Pantoprozole/Dexilant and Pepcid. I really started feeling much better after that (and it was pretty stagnant before that). This is not to say that Pantoprozole and Dexiland and other things are bad. I definitely think you need that for a few weeks to give your stomach a break.





Not super related but I also started taking Himalayan Pink Salt instead of normal salt with my food. I'm now such a huge fan of HPS that I will never go back to normal salt.





Gastritis Burp Count

\---------------------

In March I realized my burp count could be an indicator my stomach health. I had an app on my phone and I counted every burp every day till September. I was hoping to see a decreasing time series but it really wasn't decreasing with any significance. I do not think there was any signal here (atleast after stopping Pantoprazole)



March to May - 60 to 75 

May onwards - between 55 to 75 (some times 78 or 80)

But this time I was really struck by those flashbacks to the beginning of it all. June and Moira are out protesting and people start shooting.  They see people crumple to the ground and they hide in a coffee shop.  Generally speaking, I'm not afraid to protest.  But is this going to happen in the US?

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

1j28n9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1j28n9x/people_genuinely_care_i_promise/,People genuinely care. I promise.,"I was asked to staff our visitor center on Saturday since there was a protest scheduled just down the road. The day was surprisingly calm - business as usual and not a single press inquiry. I left at the end of my shift and saw that there were still protesters hours after the scheduled time. 300 people were holding signs, waving at passing vehicles, and respectfully educating folks about threats to public lands and the federal workforce. The demonstrators saw my uniform and loudly cheered as I drove by. In the crowd, I saw the smiling face of one of my terminated employees. I drove around the block until the crowd dispersed since I couldn't associate with the demonstration, but I wanted to stop and see how she was holding up. 

Circling back after running a quick errand, I saw her at a little coffee spot across the street from the protest location. The demonstrators had completely cleared out. The outdoor seating was packed with the usual weekend crowd, but I felt comfortable being there for a few minutes in uniform. I went up to order a coffee and a stranger strolled over, eyeing me up and down. He asked if I worked for my agency, gesturing at my patch. I replied that I did, and in my practiced customer service voice, asked if there was anything I could help with. His response took me by surprise. He thanked me for my service and was adamant about paying for my coffee. I politely declined his offer, telling him several times that I couldn't accept it. He shoved his card to the cashier before I could dig mine out of my bag. I shook the kind stranger's hand, introducing myself and telling him how much the gesture meant to me right now.

My terminated employee walked up during the exchange, her smile soon twisting into teary anguish. Upon seeing her face, the pain of the past month gutted me on the spot. My emotions quickly matched hers as I scooped her into a hug. Through tears, I told her how incredibly sorry I am and how much I miss seeing her around the office. I asked if she would sit with me, just for a minute, and we scouted for a table. At this point, multiple other patrons approached us. I tried to wipe the tears from my cheeks and appear presentable, but struggled to regain composure. Many said they came for the protest, and they're so sorry for what I'm going through. Their demeanor made it clear how much they love our public lands and sympathize with federal employees. I thanked them, but managed to say nothing about the current situation while in uniform. I didn't need to speak for them to see the emotion on my face. I gave countless hugs and absorbed every supportive word. I'm still scared and angry, but most of all, I'm incredibly grateful. This experience was a welcome reminder of why I chose this career.


TLDR: A group of kind strangers sympathized with the current challenges faced by federal employees and provided unexpected comfort in an emotional moment. I am so moved by the genuine compassion from my community and was reminded of my calling to serve the public.",226,1740969926.0,fednews,8,0.98,False

I'm 28
I don't have any special skills
until I was 5 years old, I lived with my grandmother, I only saw my mother from the age of 6, she came and took me to live with her and my father, they were after drug rehabilitation.
There were a lot of quarrels and shouting between them and I often received physical abuse from my father because I didn't obey.

In turn, his father (my grandfather)
hanged himself because of alcoholism.
My father died when I was 14, my mother died when I was 22.
When I was 20, I got tuberculosis and couldn't continue my studies, because I noticed that I couldn't bring myself to do things I didn't like.
I saved up for a dorm room and lived there after my mom's death
I think it could be called depersonalization, because I didn't have the strength or desire to continue living and being alive at all, I just sat at my computer from morning to night, soon I realized that my life was collapsing and I started doing my own thing with a friend's suggestion mental health.
On New Year's 23, I woke up and realized I don't want to be afraid, I can achieve my goals on my own, I'm ready to live, I went to work in delivery, as a courier, they paid well and I enjoyed working.
I worked for my goal a lot
7/0 for 12-13 hours
I lived at work
I moved to another city
with friends, the same girl friend and my friend when I lived with them - they broke
up, we lived together and I realized at some point that I was falling in love with her
Somehow it turned out, it started, we started a relationship, everything was fine, and then in the middle of April I felt a click inside, I just wanted to cry and it was sad.
we were sitting in the bathroom, we had a romantic evening, but the only thing I felt was grief
Soon I began to lose focus, goals, motivation
With the advice of a girl, I went to the doctor and started taking antidepressants, but they did not help.

We broke up, and I went back to my town.
Because I wasn't working, I was cold and apathetic, I took out a loan, a lot of loans
She found out about it and tried to help me, but it was as if I had blacked out and was falling down without any desire for life.
it clicked again, I realized that it was impossible
to live like this, I began to work a lot
came back to her in the city and I showed that I had solved my problems and now I am a different person
She didn't believe me at first, but I was doing things that I hadn't done before, I was doing everything in time, and every life situation only aroused excitement in me.
we started dating, I moved in with her, announced my plans for the near future, that I was saving up for a motorcycle, and investing the money to have a passive income.

I worked like this for several months and it clicked again, I just woke up in the morning and felt inside not a craving, not how my body gets up and goes to work satisfied, I felt a copulation and rejection
I made coffee and spent an hour persuading to go to work, I went and every day I felt more and more this copulation, I know I need to save up for a motorcycle, but I can't get up, something isn't working, I can't see or feel my purpose, and I'm starting to fall again.
the girl said that something was changing, I was not as alive as before and cold, I got up and cried and went to work, I saved up the right amount, bought a motorcycle and drove it to the garage.
And I just lay down, I couldn't get up, I woke up from work and slept for 12-13 hours.
I started sitting at the computer again, the girl said that she knew everything would be the same as last time, that I was very cool at first, and then that it was becoming unbearable to live with me, I was just like a brat
We broke up again
She forced me to go to the doctor,im telling him my story and my feelings and  he diagnosed me with bipolar disorder 2 Like, and now I'm taking latuda
from the first reception, there were very strong side effects in the form of severe akathisia
the doctor advised me to take mendilex and he closed the side effects by 90%
Now I am trying to realize that my behavior is just a disorder
but I do not know what is a normal condition, who I am, what my values
are, and the intense pain of what I am I was so irresponsible about my mental health and that I destroyed my relationship with a beautiful girl twice
I still love her and am attached to her
But in this state I cannot be in a relationship
I am cold, apathetic and not alive

but I have a lot of work ahead of me, working with myself and a psychologist and finding what I really am without depression and mania.
I am not happy at all about the fact that I have fulfilled my childhood dream. 
I bought a 2005 kawasaki zx6r, but I'm ready to sell it right now.

It happened so quickly and incomprehensibly to me that I don't understand what happened.

I hope I can overcome this condition and continue working in order to heal and return to life with a good mood and a desire to live.",1,1740969731.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

Many coffee enthusiasts often wonder, ""Is espresso good for you?"" The answer lies in numerous health benefits associated with this beloved beverage. Espresso, a concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans, is rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the body.

Moreover, espresso contributes to improved mental alertness. Caffeine, the primary active ingredient, can enhance focus, cognition, and even memory retention. Studies suggest that moderate consumption of caffeine, such as that found in espresso, may lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

In moderation, espresso can also boost metabolism. The caffeine content stimulates thermogenesis, which may aid in weight management by increasing calorie burn. Additionally, some research suggests that drinking espresso may lower the risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

- **Heart Health:** Moderate coffee consumption, including espresso, is linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
- **Liver Protection:** Espresso may help support liver health, potentially protecting against conditions like fatty liver disease.
- **Physical Performance:** Caffeine is known to enhance athletic performance by increasing adrenaline levels and improving endurance.

However, it is essential to enjoy espresso in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake can lead to anxiety, sleep disturbances, and digestive issues. Generally, consuming one to two shots of espresso daily can be part of a healthy diet.

In summary, when consumed wisely, espresso can be a flavorful addition to a balanced lifestyle. Its potential health benefits, combined with its rich, robust flavor, make it a popular choice among coffee drinkers. So, the next time you ask yourself, ""Is espresso good for you?"" remember that, with moderation, it can certainly be a delightful and healthful drink.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Monsters and Memories has put out their latest newsletter and boy is it a doosey. Not only have they cut their yearly spend from the past year they have somehow made extreme progress.

Niche Worlds Cult has been filling positions left and right to stick to their potential EA Q1 Release. No word yet if EA will come with a price tag but the way things have been going they most likely will keep it free until they can prove to us as a community that their product is worth buying. Personally I think it is worth it now but they continue to hold their line. However a few of the dev team does stream and do allow subs/bits/donations/coffee tips/ and my favorite reach around.

The best news to take away from all this though is they have announced the first playtest of the year. April 11th-13th. We all have been eager for another big long test since the last one where they unleashed dragons and a few other big names mobs. one of which got trained and AOE‚Äôd a ton of people. We are still investigating who but have a pretty good lead.

As it stands from all the streams that Shawn aka alovongrobot the project is on track and moving ahead on schedule. You can watch all his VODs and others on their YT https://youtube.com/@monstersmemories .

If you aren‚Äôt following the project I highly recommend you do if you are looking for that classic MMO itch with a new generation feel.

I do circus as a hobby alongside my full-time job and go to the gym almost every day. I run my errands on my bike and even ride it to the office. My active lifestyle makes it hard to spend time with my family, but I always try my best to be there for them. I visit my mom regularly and help her with her dog (a 1-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog) by taking him to the park or for a run. I don‚Äôt mind doing this because it‚Äôs family ‚Äì we have to help each other in every way possible.

Unfortunately, I have a debilitating back injury ‚Äì a herniated disc ‚Äì that is so painful it can leave me almost immobile. I‚Äôve been struggling with this injury since my mid-twenties. Despite this, I try to make my life enjoyable by staying active through classes and outings. A few years ago, during an aerial rings class, I aggravated the injury. I had to lie on the floor, unable to move or get up. My instructor called an ambulance while I contacted my mom. I spent the night in the hospital and returned to my mom‚Äôs place the next morning. That evening, my cousin (36, female, but younger at the time) came to visit and was shocked to see my condition. She asked what happened, and I told her about the accident. She seemed worried and asked why I hadn‚Äôt called her for help or at least asked her to visit me in the hospital. I explained that I was in too much pain to even think about calling anyone. I had assumed her mother would have told her about my condition, but she told me that she had only heard I was injured, but she didn‚Äôt realize how severe it was. She thought I had just pulled a muscle. That annoyed me a little. Why would I spend the entire night in the hospital for a muscle strain? I decided not to let my irritation build up. She offered to help, but I was too exhausted to do anything more that day. Plus, my mom was taking care of me while I stayed at her place.

Two days later, I went home and worked from home. The pain was unbearable, and I had to take the rest of the week off. I could barely move and had to crawl around my house. Even going to the bathroom or taking a bath was an ordeal. My mom came by a few times to check on me, and my cousin‚Äôs mom also helped, but my cousin NEVER came to check on me ‚Äì not even once. It really infuriated me because I knew I would have done much more for her if the roles were reversed. I got so upset that one day, still stuck in bed, I called her and yelled at her. I asked why she hadn‚Äôt checked on me since we last spoke. She came up with excuses, saying she was busy, that her house was far away, and that she had a dog to take care of. I understand she didn‚Äôt have a car, but she used her bike to get to work, so how couldn‚Äôt she spare an hour to come help me? I scolded her, telling her that I would‚Äôve been there for her if she had been in my position. I expected so much more from her because I considered her like a sister. We were very close, always together. She even took circus classes with me once, even though she didn‚Äôt enjoy it, and came to the gym with me, even though it was farther from her home. Why is she so willing to be around me when I‚Äôm at my best, but not when I‚Äôm suffering?

After that call, she came to my place, brought me food, and cooked me dinner. Then she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your husband, you can‚Äôt expect me to do all this for you.‚Äù I was livid. How dare she? I yelled at her again, telling her I was crippled, and as a family, she should be there for me! She didn‚Äôt need to be my husband to care for me. She apologized and helped me after that. She came over almost daily, cleaned, and cooked dinner for me. Even on weekends, she would ask what I needed, and even if I told her I was okay, she would clean anyway. She continued helping me even after I started feeling better. I eventually had to stop her and tell her to calm down. I didn‚Äôt expect her to keep cleaning after me now that I was healthy. I was just upset because she lacked empathy during my recovery. We hugged, and everything seemed to be okay after that.

Then karma came knocking. A year or two after my injury, she broke her foot while jogging. She tore a ligament and broke two bones. I felt a bit of satisfaction, though I felt bad about it too. At the time, I was working out and had my phone on vibrate, so I missed her call. She contacted her brother, who took her home. Despite her protests, her mom insisted she didn‚Äôt need to go to the hospital and sent her home. I really think she should have gone, because when I visited her the next day, her foot was swollen to twice its size. Her mom took her to the hospital after she finished working from home, and she got an air cast. For the next three months, she worked from home and called me almost every day to complain about the pain and her inability to move around. I admit I felt a bit smug. After everything I went through, she thought complaining about foot pain was going to make her case. I told her to suck it up and crawl if she had to. I didn‚Äôt visit her often, though. I was still bitter about how she treated me during my recovery. I had to yell at her to get her to care. After a while, she mentioned I wasn‚Äôt visiting as much, and that her brother and even her best friend were more present than I was. She told me I wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù as I said I would be if the roles were reversed. I told her straight up, ‚ÄúI had to yell at you for you to care. Now you expect me to help you after everything you put me through?‚Äù She apologized and told me she still helped me after that, but it still didn‚Äôt change the fact that I had to yell at her to get any help from her.

Now, fast forward to the present. I injured myself again, I had to crawl around because of the flare-up. My cousin‚Äôs apartment had sewer flooding, and she couldn‚Äôt stay there due to the strong odour. She asked if she could come to stay with me, promising to keep me company and help me around the house. I told her she was welcome to come. She brought her dog, which was fine.

The next day, I made her coffee, and she went straight to work on her laptop. I took the day off to recover, but she still had to work, which I respected. She had to take her dog out in the morning and at lunch, which was normal. She noticed my car buried in snow after a snowstorm and asked if I wanted help digging it out. I said it would be great, and she said she‚Äôd do it after she finished working. At lunch, she mentioned ordering smoked meat and offered me some. I told her my brother was coming to bring me food, and she said okay. When the food arrived, I asked her to make peas to eat with the smoked meat, and she did ‚Äì but she didn‚Äôt offer me any. Fine. My brother arrived, and we ate the food he brought. He mentioned that the house smelled like garbage, and I explained that I couldn‚Äôt take out the trash because of my injury. He said he‚Äôd do it. I also told him I couldn‚Äôt dig out my car, and he offered to do that too. Meanwhile, my cousin sat there, eating her smoked meat and not lifting a finger. I was furious. She was in my house, aware of all the things that needed to be done, and not once did she offer help. She did offer to help with the car, but by the time she would‚Äôve done it, I could have gotten a ticket! I appreciated the offer, but there were so many other things that would‚Äôve helped me more.

After she finished working, she folded the sheets and packed up the air mattress, then called her dad to come pick her up. I was livid. She had promised to help, but she did nothing of value! Absolutely nothing.

After she left, I blocked her number and decided to cool down before confronting her. Her mom kept calling to check on me, and she mentioned that my cousin had been trying to reach me. I lied and told her I was fine and would contact her daughter soon. I didn‚Äôt want her to know I was angry with her selfish daughter.

Then on Saturday, my mom and aunt visited. My mom cleaned, and my aunt prepared dinner. There was a knock at the door. I went to open it, but my aunt quickly went ahead and opened it. My cousin walked in, smiling and shivering from the cold. She greeted me like nothing had happened and seemed surprised to see my mom and aunt there. I said nothing, just gave her a cold stare. While she was taking off her coat, she mentioned that she‚Äôd been trying to reach me all week to see if I needed anything. I ignored her and pretended to focus on the food simmering on the stove. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre being well taken care of,‚Äù she joked, laughing. That‚Äôs when I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore. I turned to her and yelled, ‚ÄúWhy are you laughing? Do you think my injury is a joke? I‚Äôm here, crippled and in pain, and you come over and don‚Äôt even offer to help with the house! You didn‚Äôt clean up after yourself, didn‚Äôt take out the trash, and didn‚Äôt even offer to help me with anything else!‚Äù I went on, though I don‚Äôt remember everything I said. I was furious. She just stared at me and started making excuses. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask for anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúI offered you smoked meat, but you didn‚Äôt want any.‚Äù ‚ÄúI put away the mattress.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had to take care of my dog.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was so preoccupied with the flooding at my apartment‚Ä¶‚Äù I told her off, asking how she could be so oblivious. She‚Äôs an adult, doesn‚Äôt she have the mental capacity to figure out that the house needs cleaning by just looking at the mess? How does she think I feel, with all the clutter and the trash? I told her how entitled and selfish she was, especially after everything I had done for her.

She cried and said I was being unfair and that I should‚Äôve asked for help if I wanted anything done. She said she didn‚Äôt know how I was feeling because I had been so quiet. I was quiet because she should‚Äôve been able to see it herself. I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell her! She should have known better! I would‚Äôve done so much more for her. I was kind enough to let her stay over. Why couldn‚Äôt she show the same level of kindness to me?

I don‚Äôt feel bad. I was right to be angry at her. She‚Äôs being a terrible cousin, and I expected so much more from her. I‚Äôm writing this here because I started feeling a bit uncertain. I know I‚Äôm right, and my family agrees with me. But when I told my friends, they all said I was too harsh. They think I should‚Äôve asked for help instead of expecting her to know what to do. But I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask when she can clearly see everything that needs to be done! So‚Ä¶ was I the a\*hole?",0,1740968409.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,40,0.27,False
