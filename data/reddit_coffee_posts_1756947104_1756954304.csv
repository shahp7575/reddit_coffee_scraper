we even made plans to get coffee after class and just talk. but as things progressed, he explained he wasn‚Äôt emotionally available (just got out of a relationship) and basically just wanted to hang and talk as friends, but also have sex. i said i was down.

we were talking pretty consistently for a couple days, but i noticed he only really seemed interested in talking sexually. if we weren‚Äôt talking sexually, he was conveniently too busy or tired.

two days ago, he said he‚Äôd been feeling down the whole day abt his ex and doesn‚Äôt want to talk anymore, only in class. he said he thought he was ‚Äúready to get to know someone knew‚Äù but isn‚Äôt. i said that‚Äôs fine, but i felt weird.

first of all, we have class together and i have to see him every week, so it‚Äôs going to be so awkward. we spoke very sexually and i even sent him explicit pics (not fully naked, but still). secondly, i feel like the ex thing is an excuse bc he was fine being super sexual like the day prior.

it sucks because i embarrassed and naive for trying to talk to him as friends, he probably felt overwhelmed. but the thing is, he was the one who mentioned being friends and he approached me first. i wish he would‚Äôve been honest about what he wanted bc i would be down for strictly hooking up.

i guess i wanna ask for advice on how can i make things less awkward in class? bc i have so much anxiety thinking about it. also, maybe some clarity on what his mindset/intentions might be because i‚Äôm very inexperienced with this stuff. i wish there was a way to reconcile, even if it‚Äôs just hooking up, because i‚Äôm really attracted to him and i‚Äôm frustrated and disappointed.

please help !! :(

TL;DR: a guy in class approached me wanting to be FWB. at first, he said he wanted to hang and talk and friends, but later on he seemed only interested in talking sexually. couple days ago, he said he didn‚Äôt want to talk/see each other anymore. i want advice on how to make class less awkward. also, on if there‚Äôs any change for reconciliation or help me better understand his mentality.",1,1756954127.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Been living here for 5+ years and tired of people saying there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to do‚Äù here. Yes, we‚Äôre not Hollywood or Downtown LA, but we‚Äôve got some solid spots that actually make this place pretty cool. Here‚Äôs my personal list of attractions that are worth your time:

Nature/Outdoor Stuff:

	‚Ä¢	Placerita Canyon Nature Center - Not just hiking trails, they have live animals and the waterfall trail is gorgeous after rain

	‚Ä¢	William S. Hart Park - Has a legit bison herd and mini zoo that most people don‚Äôt know about

	‚Ä¢	Whitney Canyon Waterfall - Easy 3.5 mile hike to an actual waterfall (shocking, I know)

	‚Ä¢	Castaic Lake - Busiest rec lake in LA County for a reason. Great for fishing/boating

	‚Ä¢	Vasquez Rocks - 15 min drive north but iconic rock formations (yes, from Star Trek)

Food Spots That Actually Hit:

	‚Ä¢	The Loaf - Best bakery/coffee combo. Their Sea Salt Matcha Cold Brew is chef‚Äôs kiss

	‚Ä¢	Royal Tandoor - Legitimately some of the best Indian food in LA County

	‚Ä¢	Mr. Bacano - Colombian fast food with burgers that will ruin other burgers for you

	‚Ä¢	Mom Can Cook Thai Kitchen - Don‚Äôt sleep on Canyon Country side of town

Family/Date Night:

	‚Ä¢	MB2 Racing - Go-karts and mini golf that‚Äôs actually fun for adults

	‚Ä¢	Ice skating rink by Valencia HS - Where the LA Kings practice AND they filmed The Office episode ‚ÄúThreat Level Midnight‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	All Locked Up/Arcane - Multiple escape room locations that are surprisingly well done

	‚Ä¢	Sidecar Market - Speakeasy vibes, make reservations

Free Entertainment:

	‚Ä¢	Concerts in the Park - Every Saturday July/August at Central Park. Actually good bands

	‚Ä¢	Farmers Market - Sundays at COC, way better than it used to be
	‚Ä¢	Old Town Newhall - Small but decent bar/restaurant scene developing

Unique SCV Things:

	‚Ä¢	Gibbon Conservation Center - Seriously one-of-a-kind globally

	‚Ä¢	Central Park Disc Golf - Great beginner course
	‚Ä¢	Trek Bike Park - Mountain biking paradise if that‚Äôs your thing

Real talk - the best part about SCV is you get suburban peace but you‚Äôre 45 minutes from literally everything LA has to offer via Metrolink.

5:45am

I just want it all to stop. After some restless hours, I am awake again, wrapped in sheets, finally comfortable, as morning light seeps in the edges of my blackout curtains.

The garbage truck outside trundles down the street, exhausting loudly as it tips and drops. 

My housemate gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom down the hall. I feel nervous, although I keep the bathroom clean, I have been throwing up a lot. I hate this house because it feels like it's his, not ours. If I had an OnlyFans I could buy my own house, and clog all the bathrooms every single day.

In any case it's clean enough, so I drift back into half-sleep until he shuts the door. He used to slam the doors when he left in the morning, at 6am. He is inconsiderate like that. But I asked him to stop and he did. 

So he leaves, and I hear him out the front pulling the red bin in from the street. I feel nervous again, what if the bags I left in there discreetly were found. No one wants to stumble upon 4L vomit bottles wrapped in plastic and old clothes. 

I've been here before, three years ago, with old housemates... that was just before everything got good. I hold onto that hope like ice in a fire.

He drives off and the house is empty. I'm awake now, brain whirring, exhausting, before the sun has even risen. A bad night. It's because of those new pills.

I climb out of bed and take three tablets: two long blue, one white capsule. They will knock me out and slow down the fire, plus I can't throw up for an hour after I take them because they need to digest. It's a buffer window, it's helpful.

The hopelessness washes over me like a forcefield, I weaken and break without much of a fight and call my ex-boyfriend on the phone. Always a mistake. He doesn't answer the first four times, but he gets the notifications and unmutes me. I cry on the phone telling him how I feel. He coulsn't care less, he says he's doing just fine. He split town, I have no idea where he is. People are talking in his background. He's wide awake, chirpy. Happier without me. He sounds calm.

I hang up and think I should probably make a plan finally. There's a bag of heroin in a brown cigar box on my desk, low quality herion, heavily cut. I could snort it, but it might not be enough. I fall into dreams of suicide. My favourite is the jumping from a cliff, landing splat on the rocks below. My fear isn't of dying, my fear is that I will survive. If I do it wrong, I'll just be worse off and maybe I wont be able to try again. So it has to be right. Overdose. Gasoline. Jumping. Ocean. 
...
...

10:45am

I wake up again. It takes me a while to orient, I know I'm going to be lazy dazed from the drugs. It's been over an hour, so I take a bag of chocolate honeycomb beside my bed and start eating. 

I do it because there is nothing else in my head, the desire and ambition I once had are dead, the future I held in my hands once is vanquished, my dreams are faded and stale. It's all natural, it's normal. 

I eat to anchor myself in the real world, in the taste, the chewing, the belly filling up and emptying out again. 

I crawl out of bed and walk to the bathroom and vomit up the chocolate honeycomb. I don't even enjoy it anymore. Did I ever? It comes out easily, that's why I like this honeycomb. It's delicious, and interesting, and fun to throw up. It comes out in a big slimy pile, brown sludge in the toilet that I flush away and flush again.

I am swaying walking, the medications fucks my head and I can't see properly. But my mind is slow. I can deal with things like this. I don't have to think, at least right now.

I won't fall back asleep because the sun is bright and the trains are moving and people are up. The energy of the city is bright and awake and it perforates my field and I can't sleep while the restless world is turning, so I turn on the coffee machine in the kitchen and make a coffee. I take two more blue pills, another buffer, 30 minutes until my eyelids grow heavy, and the hum of my brain dims down. I know I'm letting everyone down, but as long as I'm on the drugs, they're far away, they're a blur like the rest of my potential and life.

Everything is stuck in its place. I am cemented, concreted into this hellhole. I can't move an inch. I drink my coffee outside. The ghost and shadows of my ex in his car, pulling up on the street, I see it in my mind. Each car I think is him for a split second. My dad, somewhere, thinking of me. Loving, supportive, claustrophobic. My mum somewhere, stewing silently, prideful and empty inside. Just like me, like everyone. Confused, empty, sold out, unmoveable, stuck in purgatory.

Coffee and Benadryl.

I walk back inside and get into bed. The clank and rumble of the trains, of the traffic. I feel it like a pulse. 

My thoughts come up to take form, shadowy, and they are dissolved by the anti-memory blue pills. But in my body holds every single memory of my life. I live theough them. The drives, the sand and beaches, the friendship, soft eyes, loving eyes, cold mornings camping over frosty grass, community, soul. Terrible things, love, desertment, yearning. I remember the smell of my ex in the images of his bedroom that flash into my mind. He smells like safety, he is my soulmate. His drink, I think of his guts frying from the alcohol. I would sacrifice my life for him in a heartbeat, to support and love him, but he doesn't want me for that or anyone. I don't know if it's morality or stupidity.

12:30pm

I dread my housemate's return at 3pm. He works every day, like clockwork, wakes up without a fight, comes home, buries his feelings and thoughts into the TV or the bathroom or the run. It's a routine. I don't know if he judges me, I barely leave the house. I shouldn't care but I do, it's uncomfortable. I feel watched, analysed, studied.

The blue pill washes my brain in mystery and calm. I think of ways to get more, they only sell them on a certain schedule. I take more than is allowed. I don't want to think. It's inevitable, but I can't relax. I need to relax.

My soul cries electric waves through my deserted body. I made peace with my death back in 2023, with the overdose, I said my goodbyes already. They saved my body, but I am long gone. I'm just waiting. I'm just here, and the cloudd and the air and the streets and the cars move and build around me. Inam stagnant in my memories of friendships forming, dusty old factory bedrooms, caravans, wet, dry, things etch themselves into my subconscious eith chisels and knives. I cannot escape it. Colours, shapes, textures, temperatures, feelings, smells. I miss the wrinky eye smiles, I miss the rough wiry stubble, I miss the tall chested, long limbed, pale skinned, big smile, wide eyes, knowing grin, loving of my ex-lover. 

I miss the rape, I miss the showers, I miss the disrespect, I miss rallying, I miss the passiom, I miss the ground under my feet. I miss my friends.

I miss the tension. I miss my nerve.

I close my eyes to forget but the scene plays out in the dark matrix behind my eyelids.

I crunch biscuits so loud I cannot hear my thoughts, I cannot remember. A dog barks outside. I want it to be over.",1,1756953808.0,counttheheadlights,0,1.0,False

I decided to cover his life and work from a queer perspective, which I haven't seen before, despite the fact he was (famously) a closeted gay man. 

And it's blown the fuck up. At the time of writing it has 3.2k views and a bunch of lovely comments (and a few nasty homophobic ones, but I've removed those). An Australian television history archivist has been in contact with me because of it and has been sending me scans of rare Graham Kennedy articles from the TV magazines he owns! I've also been told by the Australian Queer Archives that I can access and peruse archival material they have related to Graham Kennedy! I sent it to my old literature teacher who now wants us to catch up over a coffee and discuss it at length! 

As far as I understand it, it's EXTREMELY rare for a first YouTube video to get the amount of engagement I've been getting, so I guess I've covered the topic pretty bloody well. 

I'm so fucking happy about this. Graham Kennedy is so important to me, I've had a number of hyperfixations and special interests in my life, but nothing has hit me quite so close to my heart as he has. And I've had a number of people say they could see the love and passion and dedication I put into my essay. I'm so glad I get to share my special interest with the world and get such a good response.

I looked back at the kids in their car seats and theyre tucked in, hair brushed, cute outfits, shoes and snacks in their backpacks, bottles filled and ready to go...

Then I looked at myself, no make up, bags under my eyes, hair in the same mum bun for 2 days, ate a handful of crackers & a slice of cheese for breakfast. And can't remember last time I drank a cup of water. 

Be sure to look after yourself too. We sacrifice so much of ourselves for our kids but we deserve to feel somewhat put together too. 2u2 trenches is a wild, demanding and thankless stage of being a parent. 

I've decided I'll be trying a few new ideas to ensure I look after myself too; 
- Eat a snack I actually like without sharing it
- get the kids to dance to a few songs just to give me 10mins of being hands off. 
- going to get myself a notebook to write down random shit I remember so I don't forget. I always think of things and then get frustrated when I forget them cause I'm on the run
- survival, im not going to try and be perfect, just efficient. The kids can eat eggs & fruit 3 days in a row for breakfast they dont care. Pre cut fruit, bulk cook eggs and serve as needed each morning. 
- if baby is sleeping & toddler is busy playing, Im sitting on my ass not cleaning haha chores for hygiene are important like dishes but laundry can wait until later. 
- going to prioritise quick easy snacks like boiled eggs, nuts, cheese sticks, protein bars and pre packaged meals I can microwave. It's only short term until the kids get older and a lean cuisine with chicken & veggies is better than doritos and another coffee. 

We can do thus, I promise you. Please stay strong, this is only a season in life and it will be a distant memory when you're kids are happily playing at the ages of 10&12 etc ü•∞üíó ",4,1756953325.0,2under2,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm setting up my first open-air vivarium and I‚Äôd love some feedback. My goal is to grow mostly moss, but I might add a few small plants later. Here‚Äôs my plan so far (please correct me):

* Drainage layer on the bottom (planning to use aquarium gravel from Amazon)
* Barrier layer on top of that (window screen mesh or a coffee filter)
* Terrarium soil on top as the planting medium
* Will use some branches or rocks to make accents

It said 'Does it matter to a lost boy like you?'
So I walked on, past the rusted gates of heaven
Where the wind still sang someone else's prayers.

I saw flying pandas above the thunder clouds,
Their fur catches sunbeams, melts into aurora streaks.
They pirouette around electric lightning,
Chasing whispers of forgotten lullabies.

Birds sing through orange haze of mystique dawn,
Wings brushing against streaks of neon rain.
God is both an artist and an artiste,
Painting chaos with subtle elegance.

Mermaids serenading forgotten sailors,
Church bells tolling for those who never returned,
Beings of light balancing two suns at right angles,
Lonely hearts being nursed by the sepia angels.

Daydreaming at odd hours,
We sip liquid moonlight from tin cans,
Our shadows flicker against the tiled moon,
Time dissolves like sugar in hot coffee.

Flying pandas call me by my childhood name,
They juggle planets, small and large,
Smiling in riddles, licking starlight from fingertips,
As we try to untangle the meaning of our own hands.

The river was right, time died a long time ago.
I'm still a lost boy but now I have a destiny.
Between the corridors of the golden castle,
I'm playing hide n seek with the flying pandas.

1n7yboc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/1n7yboc/dizziness_from_bcomplex_injections/,Dizziness from B-complex injections,"Hello!

 I've had vertigo and vestibular migraines for years. Sometimes I feel dizzy, but not vertigo.  

These days have been very difficult, I have been very stressed, I work for an IT consultancy and stress is part of everyday life, I have physically somatized all that stress, I get tired and my head hurts after a few minutes of any physical activity, and in moments of maximum stress I feel that it is so much that I feel like it is going to trigger a strong episode of vertigo or that I am going to faint on the keyboard right in the middle of a meeting,

anyway, I had a very stressful meeting at 11 am, it didn't make me dizzy, I went to the doctor at noon, he prescribed me B complex injections and gave me the first of 5 injections, everything was fine for a few hours, I even felt better, but at 3 pm I had a long and very stressful job interview, when I finished the meeting, I was very nervous, I felt tremors in my body as if I had drunk too much coffee, and a couple of hours later I had extremely strong dizziness, not vertigo, but the dizziness had the same devastating effect on my body as if it had been an episode of vertigo

I couldn't walk without having to hold onto the walls, I lay down and after a few hours I felt better and woke up much better the next day, just with a slight dizziness, but I don't know what could have caused it,

 I don't know if it was a side effect of the injection or it's still due to stress, or both, now I'm afraid to get the injection tomorrow because I don't want to feel bad, since I have an appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow and I don't want to miss it, what do you think it was?

We met in 2016 when we both had partners and flirted and talked on and off until 2 years ago. I left my girlfriend and she left her husband. Won‚Äôt go into detail but she just said they were mostly just friends and she didn‚Äôt really love him. She makes me feel loved and the relationship is great - except for my suspicions about said previous husband. They are still best friends and talk and they have a daughter together. I worry they are too close and recently we bought a house. He picks his daughter up for school every morning and a few times I have noticed that there are 2 coffee mugs in the sink when she‚Äôs the only one home. My one rule is he doesn‚Äôt come inside when I‚Äôm not there and now I think he is. I asked her about it and she was just like ‚Äúyeah I don‚Äôt know‚Äù and ‚Äúno I would never let him in without you being here‚Äù. Part of me rationalizes it; that they are friends and have a daughter and they are going to talk. Another part of me is suspicious and always looking for clues or whatever that she‚Äôs cheating or whatever; always trying to catch glimpses of her phone when she‚Äôs on it or thinking she‚Äôs talking to him as soon as I‚Äôm not around.

it scares me to imagine myself 40 years down the line still reminiscing on the times we spent together. reminiscing on your smile, the slight stains on your front teeth, that i assume are from the coffee and cigarettes you love. reminiscing on your chest, the way i‚Äôd sink into it. nothing has ever made me feel safer.

i never stop wondering how much of it was real. when you held me and kissed every inch of my body, did you feel it in the same way i did? was it love? or was i nothing more than a distraction, an easy target to feast on? i question every moment we shared. after the breakup, you told our friend you had lost feelings early into the relationship but were too afraid to say anything in fear of hurting me.

i find it frustrating when people say i was in love with a version of a person i created in my head. that sentiment implies that i was somehow blind to who you are. but i loved every last bit of you. i loved you for all your disagreeable qualities, not despite them. i loved you despite your disdain for me. i knew the ugly, i lived the ugly.

i knew i loved you very early on, but it become especially clear when you broke things off. i‚Äôve always been the kind of girl who completely erases her previous partners from her life. i couldn‚Äôt bare to encounter them again. with you, though, i would‚Äôve given anything to have maintained a connection with you, even if it was platonic.

***New York Stock Exchange,NYC.***

***October, 19, 1987***



Harvey looked out onto the Manhattan skyline as he took a drag of his cigarette.He thought back to his days at Yale, how he and his fraternity threw the best parties on campus, he smiled and let out a small chuckle.Those days were far past him, now he was Vice President of Equiteys trading at Solesman Brothers, with a new mansion in New Jersey, and bombshell of a wife.He was living the american dream.



Before he could podder some more a voice came from behind him.



‚ÄúHarvey!‚Äùthe voice shouted.



Harvey turned around to see Adam, his coworker and closest friend.Both of them had started at the firm the same year, both were from Rhode Island.Naturally they became close, almost like brothers.



‚ÄúAdam, what's going on?‚ÄùHarvey asked jovially



‚ÄúThe meeting with the director is about start.‚ÄùAdam said with a smug grin.""Can‚Äôt start without the VP.‚Äù



‚ÄúYour VP too,‚ÄùHarvey said jokingly.



‚ÄúI know, but it's fun to bust your balls.‚ÄùAdam said with a smile and chuckle.



The two made their way back inside, and down the hall towards the meeting [room.As](http://room.As) they walked Harvery looked to his left to see the trading floor.""It looks like a jungle down there.‚ÄùHe thought.



¬†He never really enjoyed being down on the floor,grown men acting like wild animals never made him feel comfortable.The only thing he liked about the floor was the money.That was his reason for anything really.Money made the world go round, and as long as the money flowed so did society.



Adam opened the door to the meeting room, inside sat the management of the firm and the director himself.



‚ÄúPerfect, now that everyone's here, I think it's time to begin.‚ÄùThe director said in his usual ""let's get down to business"" tone, the same tone he used to start the firm in the first place.‚ÄúAs you know, with the soviet economy in the shitter, some of our investments overseas are in jeopardy.I've been told most of the investments in Europe and Central America have been secured, but Africa and Asia are starting to get a bit rocky, we need to-‚Äù



Just then a new associate burst through the door, panting and sweating like the building was one fire.



‚ÄúWhats the meaning of this, we are in a very important meet-‚ÄùThe director was interrupted once more‚ÄùIts the Dow Jones sir!‚ÄùThe associate, still panting, said the line that would change everything.""It's down, it's down 22.6%!‚Äù



The room went completely silent, everyone sat for what felt like ages.



‚ÄúJesus Fucking Christ.‚ÄùOne of the VP‚Äôs said before stumbling over his chair and rushing out.Another one followed, and another until the meeting room layed a mess of scattered papers, flipped chairs, and spilled coffee.



Adam and Harvey made their way to the trading floor only to see it. The floor was in chaos, not the usual screaming to sell and celebrating as before.No, now everyone was yelling, panicking, some were even crying.



Everything was in the red, from lumber to car manufacturing.All it took was a couple hours to wipe it all away.All Harvey could do was stand and look at the glowing monitors as it showed the worsening stock prices.



‚ÄúHarvery!‚ÄùAdam yelled, shaking Harvey.""We need to go.‚Äù



What followed was hours of meetings, calls with clients, and smoking cigarettes, all of which had been but a blur to harvey.In the span of a morning Harvery‚Äôs world shattered, With the Federal chairman refusing to act and the ever increasing downward spiral of global stock prices one thing became clear to Harvey.



**There's no coming back from this.**

1. Some way to make my own coffee. Either a small single cup pour over and filters/ground coffee or something like this and beans: Cafflano Klassic : All-in-1, Drip Kettle+Grinder+Permanent Stainless Filter Dripper+Double-wall Tumbler, Pourover, Coffee Maker for Camping & Travel https://a.co/d/fXvnDBo

Paying the equivalent of CAD $6 per 4oz coffee got really old. Also take a good insulated coffee mug with lid or other alternative to hold the coffee. Hotel rooms had kettles, so easy to get the boiling water. 

2. Double check your gear for waterproofnesss if gore Tex or other membrane gear. I had my old golf rain gear and it had lost all water resistance. I should have washed it in outdoor gear detergent and then done either a spray on or wash in waterproof solution. One nice benefit, I now have a really cool Icelandic slicker from one of the Iceland tourist trap stores. Somewhat pricey, but kept me dry as a bone!

3. Footwear. Waterproof hiking boots. Mine were pretty good, and were able to dry in the hotel each night, but I can see this being a potential issue. I had ankle height light hiking. For the crater rim walks and waterfall walks they were fine. Had we been doing 8+ km hikes, they might have been light. I also appreciated having my Sketcher slip ons for walking around, driving and going to dinner etc. 

4. I took two pairs of shorts in August. Totally unnecessary. 

5. Multi-layers. The thermometer never touched +20*C, but being able to add/strip layers was handy for temp regulation. ",3,1756951816.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

Some nights, I dream of her. In those dreams, we‚Äôre back where we used to be ‚Äî laughing until our stomachs hurt, dancing in the living room, sneaking away for late-night adventures, or driving through the quiet streets with the music blaring and the windows down. I wake up clinging to that feeling, only to remember that it‚Äôs gone. Everything fell apart.

I miss our inside jokes, the way she could make me feel like the world was lighter just by being in it. She was the only woman I‚Äôve ever truly loved, and even now, I know I‚Äôm still in love with her. I forced myself to move forward because I thought she didn‚Äôt care, that maybe she didn‚Äôt want the same things I did ‚Äî a house, kids, a family we could build together.

I miss having my best friend. I miss kissing her. I wish I would have held onto that a little tighter and longer. I let emotions and outside opinions cloud my true desires, to be with her and work through everything.

There was a lot of pressure from my family who was very homophobic & I stupidly listened to everything everyone else was saying to me.

We both said some awful ugly things to each other during the divorce process and I ended up sleeping with someone else (I was under the assumption she had also moved on, with a coworker). I‚Äôve now had months to process everything and I wish we could meet up for coffee and just restart & run away together.

Truth is, I wish we had just weathered the storms, instead of letting them take us under. I wish I hadn‚Äôt been so quick to call it quits when things got hard. I find myself longing for just one more chance to sit down with her, to talk, to feel that connection again, even if only for a moment. I‚Äôd wholeheartedly give it another chance after having space and time to heal.

On the off chance you see this, I hope you reach out my angel baby. ",1,1756951816.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1n7xuuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philosophy_India/comments/1n7xuuj/purpose_of_life_is_here/,"Purpose of life is here,","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

 Am I the problem in my relationship?
 I (22F) feel like I am starting so many problems in my relationship (25M) and with people around me. All i do is try to make everyone around me happy but it seems like no matter how hard i try i end up screwing everything up. 
Lately I feel like I have had no motivation to do anything, I feel like everything is my fault and like everyone around me might be better off if I wasn‚Äôt here. I have had some bad thoughts that I haven‚Äôt allowed myself to put a plan to. Just giving you an idea of my mental state rn. I was diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety and depression. So this explains most of what I am experiencing right now. I also went through a very traumatic experience a couple months ago I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve processed yet.
I know I am at fault for some things but I feel like everything shouldn‚Äôt be my fault but it is. My bf and I have lived together for the past 2 years and have been pretty happy for the most part. I love him so much. He is a wonderful human and tries to push me to stick up for myself and stop being in such a servant mindset. 
My father has passed and my relationship with my mother is so-so I am still in communication and see her every once in a while. I have come to the conclusion that she made me to be her and my brothers caretaker and well as live in maid. I have always taken care of everything in my household and it is so overwhelming. Before I got medicated I would wake up in a panic thinking what do I need to do. I have always felt like her slave.
My bf is helping me work through this and encourages me to do what‚Äôs right for me, and has suggested low contact which I feel like I‚Äôm at now bc she usually has this crazy control over me. She‚Äôll want me to be at her house everyday, do this do that for her and I have stopped doing many of the things I used to. He encourages me and sometimes tries to push me to stand up for myself even to him. 
So lately our fights are after I talk to my mom otp. My mother does not like my bf, she has not said it straight out but every time I bring him up she talks about something else or straight up ignores me. Which is normal for her but lately it has been 10000000000% worse. 
Tonight my mother called and I sighed and answered, the conversation was normal and I thought it went ok all things considered. We were talking about a pictures she wanted to see from a trip I had went to recently and asked if my boyfriend would mind to share an album with her. She has never been to the place and wanted to see if she would want to go. But she brought up my bf and it caught me off guard and from conversations in the past I felt like he would rather not have to communicate with her so I said I can get them and figure out how to share an album. She said ok and we set up coffee for tomorrow since we haven‚Äôt seen one another In around a week. 
We hung up and I asked my bf if that was ok with him ( I wanted to know if it was ok incase I forgot about plans we had made or any appointments I had forgotten) he said yeahhhhh why did you throw me under the bus like that. I was so confused and I will admit that made me a little upset because I hadn‚Äôt felt like I did that. I said what do you mean? How did I throw you under the bus? We went on arguing for a while and ultimately his side was that I could have told her that I will ask him and see if it‚Äôs alright with him instead of coasting over it and saying I‚Äôll do it. I was just thinking he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with her and he told me that he‚Äôs still going to deal with her because she‚Äôs my mom and that he is always going to be nice and respectful towards her. I‚Äôve noticed and so has he that I like revert back to before I made any progress when I talk to her or am around her it‚Äôs like the control she has over me just swallows me and I feel like I can do nothing right. I am so moody and my emotions are all over the place and i feel like everyone‚Äôs lives are better off without me. I hate feeling like this but I hate putting my emotions on other people how can I change this? I just want full control over my life, my bf has helped so much and I am so grateful for that but I feel like I‚Äôm always the problem. Am I?",3,1756951300.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

1n7xpgy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7xpgy,Starbucks Deaf Awareness Month Poster Contains Stolen Art,"Earlier today on another post there were some questions about the origins of a design seen on a Starbucks Deaf Awareness Month Poster. I did some digging and found that The Signing Stick Figure (I'll link their profile in the comments), a HoH artist who specializes in ASL art, is the original designer, and has posted the design on multiple pieces dating back to 2022.

I reached out to them on Instagram and found out that Starbucks didn't reach out to them, compensate them, or credit them in any way. And on top of that SB kept the design but made the linework more minimalistic so it no longer portrays the motion of the design, something the artist deliberately incorporated into the original image.

This is clearly art theft.

1n7xnkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1n7xnkn/the_ballad_of_rex_rosado_part_ii/,"The Ballad of Rex Rosado, Part II","After boxing, life had taken on a diminishing rhythm for Rex Rosado. His hands healed, but not fully, and when it was cold, they hurt along the fracture lines. He took to wearing gloves. His former promoter had made sure no one in the boxing business would hire him, which deprived him of the easiest transition to his new, ordinary existence. Money was tight. Friends were none. There was only Baldie, but the promoter's wrath had extended to Baldie too, and although the old man never said it, maintaining always that he'd *wanted* to retire (‚ÄúLook at me, Rex. You were my last, remaining charge. I don't wanna take no young gun under my wing. I'm seventy-one years old. The only thing under these wings is arthritis.‚Äù) Rex knew that wasn't true. Even more than for himself, he knew that for Baldie, boxing was life.

‚ÄúYou say that so I don't feel guilty,‚Äù Rex said.

‚ÄúBullshit. I say it ‚Äòcause it's true.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what are you going to do‚Äîhow are you going to make money, spend your time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got savings. Old world mentality: etched into me like words on a headstone. Plus, I always wanted to read more. Now I got the chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just got a new kind of cereal from the grocery store the other day. *Cunt Chocula,* it's called. The box ain't gonna read itself!‚Äù

And both men laughed.

Rex visited Baldie nearly every day. He also looked for work, sometimes got some, tried it and ended up unemployed again, like the time he got hired as a mover but ended up letting an antique piano slide‚Äîcracking‚Äîdown the stairs. It hadn't been his fault. Because he was a big, strong guy, the two guys moving the piano with him decided he could hold it up all by himself. He couldn't, and so the new boss yelled at him and used several weeks of Rex's wages to make the broken antique piano's owners‚Äô whole. ‚ÄúWhat about me, who's going to make me whole!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out before I call the fucking police.‚Äù

Back on the street, Rex punched a brick wall until it hurt: both the wall and him. He couldn't make a fist or move most of his fingers for a week after, which Baldie laughed about when Rex told him. They both laughed.

He kept dropping his toothbrush, which was funny because he couldn't afford to keep squeezing out new toothpaste. Sometimes he couldn't even afford a cup of coffee, so he'd heat up an empty mug and hold it because it eased the feeling in his hands.

‚ÄúShoulda punched the piano!‚Äù Baldie said once between deep bursts of guffawing.

‚ÄúKnow what‚ÄîI love you, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I love you too. Now let's forget about it and have another drink.‚Äù

But Baldie didn't take his drinks as well as he used to. They made his face red and his heart race, and sometimes they made him lose feeling in his legs.

‚ÄúYou should see a doctor,‚Äù Rex told him.

‚ÄúI see ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

A few days later Baldie collapsed on the floor of his apartment. Rex found him that way after knocking, getting no answer and kicking in the door (much to the annoyance of Baldie's neighbours, who complained about the noise and how, now, the ratboys would get inside and start squatting) to the sight of his only friend barely breathing, smelling of booze. Rex called an ambulance and two sarcastic paramedics carried Baldie inside on a stretcher and drove him to the hospital while talking about something called a 544.

The setting of Rex's visits with Baldie became a hospital room after that, one Baldie shared with a sickly war veteran who never spoke.

‚ÄúWhen are you going to check out of here?‚Äù Rex asked. ‚ÄúI hate how fucking sanitized it is, and the beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor. I don't know how you stand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon, Rosie. Soon.‚Äù

But the doctors kept extending Baldie's stay. There was always something else wrong with him, or if not wrong, something to monitor. If you weren't sick you always had the potential. That's what was wrong with hospitals, thought Rex. They tie you up against the ropes and there's no ref to break you up, so you stay like that all the way till the final bell.

In the hospital, Baldie gained a kind of placidity he'd never had before, a calmness. Rex didn't like it. This wasn't the Baldie he knew.

After a while, it became an unspoken fact shared by the two of them that Baldie was never getting discharged from the hospital. Rex took to spending more time in the room with Baldie, and Baldie spent more of that time sleeping, his hairy chest rising and falling like hypnosis.

When he woke up, sometimes he'd yell at Rex. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of here! Go live your life, Rosie!‚Äù Other times he'd smile, rearrange himself on the bed and go back to sleep. The rotation of nurses kept him nourished on pills of all different colours. They hooked up a hose to his cock so he could piss without getting up. *But where was the count?* They washed him with sponges like he was a used car they planned on selling. ‚ÄúWhat, jealous that I got a woman to clean me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should hit on ‚Äòem. They make good dough. Some are from Arkansas.‚Äù

Then Rex got evicted for non-payment of rent. He didn't tell Baldie, but visiting him in the hospital became a way of having a warm, safe place for the night. Overnight visits were against hospital rules, but these rules were bendable if you were persistent and growled. Nobody wanted to enforce them then. They'd escort out the crying wives but leave Rex alone, because the wives were easy to deal with. ‚ÄúAre you his next of kin?‚Äù a nurse asked him.

‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

It was on one of those nights when Rex was homeless and Baldie asleep, snoring‚Äîthat Baldie woke up, his eyes sharp, mind agitated, and  said: ‚ÄúPromise me you'll get back up, Rosie. Promise me. Promise me!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, I promise. Now keep it down, will you? Some of us are trying to sleep here.‚Äù He started to laugh, but Baldie didn't join him. ‚ÄúAnd you promise me the same. I've been thinking about what we can do once you get out here, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Baldie had fallen back asleep.

Rex took the old man's hand in his, squeezed. ‚ÄúWhen you do get out of here, we'll go visit your daughter out in Lost Angeles, OK?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe don't love me. She don't wanna see me,‚Äù Baldie whispered.

‚ÄúFuck *her* and what *she* wants. The question is: do *you* wanna see her? You got a right to.‚Äù

Baldie was asleep again.

Again, Rex squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúHey! Hey, Baldie. What do we say to Father Time?‚Äù No response. *Beep-beep-beep.* ‚ÄúCome on: what do we say to Father Time, Baldie?‚Äù *Beep-beep-beep*. Rex got up, but when he did, Baldie's hand dropped limp from his grasp. ***Beeeeeeep.***

They kicked him out of the hospital after that, but he got a few good punches in before they managed it. Yeah, he gave it to a few of them good before they tossed him out on the pavement. And when the cop asked him if he was fine to get on home, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rex barked. ‚ÄúI'll get on home.‚Äù

*But where is that?* ‚ÄúWhere *is* home, Baldie?‚Äù

Baldie didn't respond.

‚ÄúI thought that maybe, once you kicked the can, you'd come back as my angel or something,‚Äù said Rex, as the few people on the streets at this hour avoided him. ‚ÄúI heard of that happening: people coming back, as voices, you know? Maybe you're not ready yet. Of course you wouldn't be. You just made it over to the other side. Tell me when you're ready. Tell me and I'll be here.‚Äù

He sat where he was, under the halo of a street lamp.

‚ÄúI'll wait.‚Äù

But it was chill and the night sky started to rain, so Rex got up and started walking again. Restless, he walked alone, turned down a narrow cobblestoned street, and turned up his collar at the cold and damp, until his eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light‚Äîit had split the night: some advertisement atop the Rooklyn Bridge.

And after the thunder had rolled, Rex was left walking in the sound of silence.

But he had a direction now.

Yes, that was why Baldie wasn't responding. He was waiting. Waiting for Rex to join him.

As he neared the bridge, Rex felt a clarity he hadn't felt since his fateful night in the ring. It was beautiful in its engineered, stone and metal splendour. (The bridge) And in its finality. (The clarity.) Sometimes the towel needs to get thrown. Sometimes the opponent is too much. He leaned over the railing and watched the river waters go by, black and unreflective of the stars above, but who was to say it wasn't the river that was above and the sky below, its stars not looking down but up, drowning.

The light was naked and he was within it.

He had boxed sometimes to crowds of thousands‚Äîcheering, yelling, booing, screaming. Now he saw another crowd around him. ‚ÄúHe's gonna do it,‚Äù somebody said. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump!‚Äù ‚ÄúDo it, do it, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù ‚ÄúBe a man.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever you feel, it's not gonna get any better. Trust me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe water doesn't hurt.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're already gone.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho even are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúGo down *and stay down*. Fifth round. Got it, Rosado?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I got it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny last words, buddy?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump already! I gotta get home to my kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe ain't legit‚Äîhe's a faker.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe's doing it for sympathy.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo sympathy from me. We all got problems.‚Äù

But the more they spoke, the greater their silence. *The rushing, churning water.* He began to climb over‚Äî

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

‚Äîwhen:

‚ÄúBaldie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No. Get down from there.‚Äù

The crowd became immediately extinguished and the light was again clothed in the ordinary uniform of existence, and the only two living people on the bridge (I say living, for there were ghosts there) were Rex and the girl. Her hair, dark. Her body, frail and wasplike.

‚ÄúYou think I haven't been in that same spot, thinking the same thing?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, who the fuck are you?‚Äù

1n7xmpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1n7xmpa/the_ballad_of_rex_rosado_part_ii/,"The Ballad of Rex Rosado, Part II","After boxing, life had taken on a diminishing rhythm for Rex Rosado. His hands healed, but not fully, and when it was cold, they hurt along the fracture lines. He took to wearing gloves. His former promoter had made sure no one in the boxing business would hire him, which deprived him of the easiest transition to his new, ordinary existence. Money was tight. Friends were none. There was only Baldie, but the promoter's wrath had extended to Baldie too, and although the old man never said it, maintaining always that he'd *wanted* to retire (‚ÄúLook at me, Rex. You were my last, remaining charge. I don't wanna take no young gun under my wing. I'm seventy-one years old. The only thing under these wings is arthritis.‚Äù) Rex knew that wasn't true. Even more than for himself, he knew that for Baldie, boxing was life.

‚ÄúYou say that so I don't feel guilty,‚Äù Rex said.

‚ÄúBullshit. I say it ‚Äòcause it's true.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what are you going to do‚Äîhow are you going to make money, spend your time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got savings. Old world mentality: etched into me like words on a headstone. Plus, I always wanted to read more. Now I got the chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just got a new kind of cereal from the grocery store the other day. *Cunt Chocula,* it's called. The box ain't gonna read itself!‚Äù

And both men laughed.

Rex visited Baldie nearly every day. He also looked for work, sometimes got some, tried it and ended up unemployed again, like the time he got hired as a mover but ended up letting an antique piano slide‚Äîcracking‚Äîdown the stairs. It hadn't been his fault. Because he was a big, strong guy, the two guys moving the piano with him decided he could hold it up all by himself. He couldn't, and so the new boss yelled at him and used several weeks of Rex's wages to make the broken antique piano's owners‚Äô whole. ‚ÄúWhat about me, who's going to make me whole!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out before I call the fucking police.‚Äù

Back on the street, Rex punched a brick wall until it hurt: both the wall and him. He couldn't make a fist or move most of his fingers for a week after, which Baldie laughed about when Rex told him. They both laughed.

He kept dropping his toothbrush, which was funny because he couldn't afford to keep squeezing out new toothpaste. Sometimes he couldn't even afford a cup of coffee, so he'd heat up an empty mug and hold it because it eased the feeling in his hands.

‚ÄúShoulda punched the piano!‚Äù Baldie said once between deep bursts of guffawing.

‚ÄúKnow what‚ÄîI love you, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I love you too. Now let's forget about it and have another drink.‚Äù

But Baldie didn't take his drinks as well as he used to. They made his face red and his heart race, and sometimes they made him lose feeling in his legs.

‚ÄúYou should see a doctor,‚Äù Rex told him.

‚ÄúI see ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

A few days later Baldie collapsed on the floor of his apartment. Rex found him that way after knocking, getting no answer and kicking in the door (much to the annoyance of Baldie's neighbours, who complained about the noise and how, now, the ratboys would get inside and start squatting) to the sight of his only friend barely breathing, smelling of booze. Rex called an ambulance and two sarcastic paramedics carried Baldie inside on a stretcher and drove him to the hospital while talking about something called a 544.

The setting of Rex's visits with Baldie became a hospital room after that, one Baldie shared with a sickly war veteran who never spoke.

‚ÄúWhen are you going to check out of here?‚Äù Rex asked. ‚ÄúI hate how fucking sanitized it is, and the beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor. I don't know how you stand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSoon, Rosie. Soon.‚Äù

But the doctors kept extending Baldie's stay. There was always something else wrong with him, or if not wrong, something to monitor. If you weren't sick you always had the potential. That's what was wrong with hospitals, thought Rex. They tie you up against the ropes and there's no ref to break you up, so you stay like that all the way till the final bell.

In the hospital, Baldie gained a kind of placidity he'd never had before, a calmness. Rex didn't like it. This wasn't the Baldie he knew.

After a while, it became an unspoken fact shared by the two of them that Baldie was never getting discharged from the hospital. Rex took to spending more time in the room with Baldie, and Baldie spent more of that time sleeping, his hairy chest rising and falling like hypnosis.

When he woke up, sometimes he'd yell at Rex. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of here! Go live your life, Rosie!‚Äù Other times he'd smile, rearrange himself on the bed and go back to sleep. The rotation of nurses kept him nourished on pills of all different colours. They hooked up a hose to his cock so he could piss without getting up. *But where was the count?* They washed him with sponges like he was a used car they planned on selling. ‚ÄúWhat, jealous that I got a woman to clean me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Baldie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should hit on ‚Äòem. They make good dough. Some are from Arkansas.‚Äù

Then Rex got evicted for non-payment of rent. He didn't tell Baldie, but visiting him in the hospital became a way of having a warm, safe place for the night. Overnight visits were against hospital rules, but these rules were bendable if you were persistent and growled. Nobody wanted to enforce them then. They'd escort out the crying wives but leave Rex alone, because the wives were easy to deal with. ‚ÄúAre you his next of kin?‚Äù a nurse asked him.

‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

It was on one of those nights when Rex was homeless and Baldie asleep, snoring‚Äîthat Baldie woke up, his eyes sharp, mind agitated, and  said: ‚ÄúPromise me you'll get back up, Rosie. Promise me. Promise me!‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, I promise. Now keep it down, will you? Some of us are trying to sleep here.‚Äù He started to laugh, but Baldie didn't join him. ‚ÄúAnd you promise me the same. I've been thinking about what we can do once you get out here, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Baldie had fallen back asleep.

Rex took the old man's hand in his, squeezed. ‚ÄúWhen you do get out of here, we'll go visit your daughter out in Lost Angeles, OK?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe don't love me. She don't wanna see me,‚Äù Baldie whispered.

‚ÄúFuck *her* and what *she* wants. The question is: do *you* wanna see her? You got a right to.‚Äù

Baldie was asleep again.

Again, Rex squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúHey! Hey, Baldie. What do we say to Father Time?‚Äù No response. *Beep-beep-beep.* ‚ÄúCome on: what do we say to Father Time, Baldie?‚Äù *Beep-beep-beep*. Rex got up, but when he did, Baldie's hand dropped limp from his grasp. ***Beeeeeeep.***

They kicked him out of the hospital after that, but he got a few good punches in before they managed it. Yeah, he gave it to a few of them good before they tossed him out on the pavement. And when the cop asked him if he was fine to get on home, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Rex barked. ‚ÄúI'll get on home.‚Äù

*But where is that?* ‚ÄúWhere *is* home, Baldie?‚Äù

Baldie didn't respond.

‚ÄúI thought that maybe, once you kicked the can, you'd come back as my angel or something,‚Äù said Rex, as the few people on the streets at this hour avoided him. ‚ÄúI heard of that happening: people coming back, as voices, you know? Maybe you're not ready yet. Of course you wouldn't be. You just made it over to the other side. Tell me when you're ready. Tell me and I'll be here.‚Äù

He sat where he was, under the halo of a street lamp.

‚ÄúI'll wait.‚Äù

But it was chill and the night sky started to rain, so Rex got up and started walking again. Restless, he walked alone, turned down a narrow cobblestoned street, and turned up his collar at the cold and damp, until his eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light‚Äîit had split the night: some advertisement atop the Rooklyn Bridge.

And after the thunder had rolled, Rex was left walking in the sound of silence.

But he had a direction now.

Yes, that was why Baldie wasn't responding. He was waiting. Waiting for Rex to join him.

As he neared the bridge, Rex felt a clarity he hadn't felt since his fateful night in the ring. It was beautiful in its engineered, stone and metal splendour. (The bridge) And in its finality. (The clarity.) Sometimes the towel needs to get thrown. Sometimes the opponent is too much. He leaned over the railing and watched the river waters go by, black and unreflective of the stars above, but who was to say it wasn't the river that was above and the sky below, its stars not looking down but up, drowning.

The light was naked and he was within it.

He had boxed sometimes to crowds of thousands‚Äîcheering, yelling, booing, screaming. Now he saw another crowd around him. ‚ÄúHe's gonna do it,‚Äù somebody said. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump!‚Äù ‚ÄúDo it, do it, do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù ‚ÄúBe a man.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever you feel, it's not gonna get any better. Trust me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe water doesn't hurt.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're already gone.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho even are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúGo down *and stay down*. Fifth round. Got it, Rosado?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I got it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny last words, buddy?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúJump already! I gotta get home to my kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe ain't legit‚Äîhe's a faker.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe's doing it for sympathy.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo sympathy from me. We all got problems.‚Äù

But the more they spoke, the greater their silence. *The rushing, churning water.* He began to climb over‚Äî

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

‚Äîwhen:

‚ÄúBaldie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No. Get down from there.‚Äù

The crowd became immediately extinguished and the light was again clothed in the ordinary uniform of existence, and the only two living people on the bridge (I say living, for there were ghosts there) were Rex and the girl. Her hair, dark. Her body, frail and wasplike.

‚ÄúYou think I haven't been in that same spot, thinking the same thing?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, who the fuck are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a boxer,‚Äù said Rex.

‚ÄúAnd I'm the girl who dared disturb the sound of silence,‚Äù said the girl who dared disturb the sound of silence. ‚ÄúBut you can call me Mona.‚Äù

Anyway now that I‚Äôm about to be 36 it dawned on me that I should have done the additional testing. I had fell for the typical ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep at night how could I have narcolepsy‚Äù nonsense.

Anyway I have my appointment made at the sleep doctor and I‚Äôm getting the tests done finally, but at this point in time I‚Äôm not officially diagnosed but I‚Äôm confident I will be, for better or worse.

Today for fun I filmed myself taking a nap when I inconveniently could not keep my eyes open at around 3:30pm (on 40mg adderall XR) to see if I could determine how fast I fall asleep with the naked eye. I knew this was a silly test I was just doing it out of curiosity. That being said I laughed out loud when i eventually watched it back and I can clearly see REM start within 20 seconds of closing my eyes.

When they woke me up from my sleep study all those years ago they were like ‚ÄúDAMN were u tired?! We‚Äôve never seen someone hit REM so fast‚Äù and I was confused because I didn‚Äôt expect to sleep at all let alone quickly. Then they handed me a styrofoam cup of coffee with one of those stirring sticks in it that is like a mini straw, and in my confusion (and who knows what level brain waves I was operating on) immediately after they warned me it was hot, I held the drink like it was a vodka soda and took a big sip from the straw from deep in the hottest part down at the bottom directly into my mouth. Traumatic tongue burn.

How quickly did you all hit REM on your studies?

They have a really nice, chill aesthetic with some high tables and a few benches to sit at inside. There's plenty of room outside with picnic tables and a lot of wide open space.

1n7xb6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1n7xb6i/what_kind_of_lawyer_do_i_need_illinois/,What kind of Lawyer do I need? ILLINOIS," Gillespie IL US.   Ok, this is going to be a long story, I‚Äôve posted before about it and got good responses. What I need now is to know where to begin. 

I‚Äôve lived in my house for six years. I pay my rent and have caused no problems.  When I moved in me and the land lords girlfriend were good friends. Time goes by after living in my house couple of years, I learn what a shitty person LL girlfriend is. Just a horrible human being. 

So, I started distancing myself from her. The whole time I‚Äôve lived in my house utilities been in LL name I pay the bills per agreement.  

Since i have moved in I‚Äôve been to court 13 times due to the Alderman that lives behind me. 

My grass is to long, my cat is staring at him and freaking him out, my garbage cans been out an hour to long just any and every reason, the judge throws it out.

 The Alderman had me banned from the gas station a block from my house just to inconvenience me, because his granddaughter is the manager. I have a ban from putting too much sugar in my coffee. 

Sent me an official ban letter and everything stating that‚Äôs the reason for my lifetime ban . Now, I have to go two miles, to the next town over to get gas. 

The most recent incident the Alderman hates my cat for whatever reason. Called animal control and even tho my cat is licensed, chipped, fixed and shotted, they took him anyway. 

I asked the alderman to leave my yard he called the police, told police I want him gone , they said they will decide who‚Äôs trespassing. 

While animal control is taking my pet  arguing with them how they have no right, the officer threatens to arrest me, in my yard! 

Part 2
All the while dealing with the Alderman, the LL girlfriend is breaking in my house I have it on camera she did it twice. 

First time claims she smelled gas but didn‚Äôt call, 911, gas company, me or my emergency contact.  Yet the whole time I‚Äôm calling her phone cuz I see her on camera! The second time she doesn‚Äôt give an excuse. First she tried to buy my house out from under me, but that didn‚Äôt  work out for her. 

Then she started having my utilities shut off one at a time, not giving me the bills to pay. I managed to save my power but have had no water for 3 months. Ik, why not put it in my name? Well I did,  payed the deposit and guess who decides not to turn on my water, yep my bestie the Alderman. 

Claiming even tho I‚Äôve lived in my house six years it needs an inspection, which magically will take the landlord months to get to. Still don‚Äôt have water. The LL girlfriend discussing my business with other people. Told someone they could move in without asking me had a roommate for three months I didn‚Äôt even know. 

Messages me from the landlords phone pretending to be him, calling me names, threatening me. Messages my kids telling them I‚Äôm doing drugs out begging people for money at night. 

Landed a little gig in the next town, had that job a week before LL girlfriend found out told boss lost my last job for stealing., (not true). Now, I‚Äôve paid my rent thru all of it. I refused this month cuz I still have no water.

 I‚Äôve had no furnace heat for three years, central air hasn‚Äôt worked for years. I have every text, photo, text from my kids phones all I need to fight back. However it‚Äôs not just the landlord it‚Äôs the Alderman‚Äôs abuse of power to. 

I could probably pay rent if I wasn‚Äôt buying water, paying people for showers or was able to keep my job! This situation is bullying at its finest and I need help. ",2,1756950006.0,AskLawyers,2,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Chapter 1 The day after my miscarriage, my husband, Austin Cadwell, asked me to donate blood for his beloved crush, Kayla Watkins. ""Doctor, her blood type matches. Kayla's had her blood before‚Äîno need to test, just use it,"" he said way too naturally. The doctor reminded him I needed to rest after my abortion, but Austin barely waited for the words to finish before dragging me off to have my blood drawn. ""Eloise Moreau, who do you think you're sulking at? Kayla getting your blood is a privilege,"" he spat, seeing my pale face as I gave him attitude. ""Draw more, doctor. She's healthy, make sure there's enough for Kayla,"" he insisted, ignoring my protests and the nurse's attempts to intervene, hauling me to the blood collection room. Afterwards, he left me there, weak and dizzy, and went straight to Kayla's room to look after her. I sat for a long time before I could summon the strength to stand and walk out. This time, I truly gave up. Austin didn't care about me at all‚Äîmy life or death meant nothing to him. Years together meant nothing compared to his first love. If a marriage can't be held together anymore, it's better to let it go.

Austin came home past midnight. He saw me sitting in the living room, tossed a bag of clothes at me, and headed for the kitchen. ""These are dirty. Make sure you wash them,"" he said. Inside the bag was one of Kayla's favorite shirts, something she'd been wearing a lot lately. If she didn't like it, she wouldn't have worn it twice. Once, Austin had dirtied one of Kayla's shirts and made me wash it for her. Afterward, Kayla asked what detergent I'd used‚Äîshe liked the scent. Ever since, he regularly brought her clothes home for me to wash. Somewhere along the line, I'd become the live-in maid, responsible for everything he needed‚Äîhis meals, his laundry, his home. He rarely came home before midnight, always blaming it on work dinners and social obligations. No matter how late I worked myself, I'd wait for him in the living room, with a late-night snack ready, afraid he'd come home hungry. He never once asked if I was tired, never wondered if I was exhausted. Sometimes, he'd even complain that the snack wasn't what he wanted. He took everything I did for granted, never truly caring about me. Just like today with the blood donation, if Kayla needed it, I was always his first thought. He acted like it was my duty. Every time he needed blood for her, he came straight to me, never hesitating. After coming home, I felt wrung out, drained of every ounce of strength. Suddenly, the kitchen erupted with the clatter of pots and pans‚Äîhe must have been angry again. Austin walked over, staring at me with irritation. ""Why didn't you leave any food for me?"" My head was spinning, my whole body aching. I had no energy left to answer. ""What are you upset about now?"" His tone was laced with impatience. ""Kayla was in a critical condition today. The hospital's blood bank was empty. I couldn't just stand by and watch her in danger. What's the big deal about giving a little blood?"" Whenever it came to Kayla, everyone else faded into the background. No matter how I tried to explain, he never listened. He was always convinced I was just making excuses. He knew how much I loved him. As long as he apologized afterward, I'd forgive him. I was pathetic‚Äîa hopeless romantic, always ready to forgive, no matter what. That's why Austin never worried about hurting me. ""Enough. Tomorrow I'll have my assistant bring you something to boost your blood. Cook it yourself and get some sleep. And don't forget to make soup in the morning‚ÄîKayla wants the soup you make. I need to bring it to her first thing."" Hearing Austin's self-righteous demands, I almost laughed out loud from sheer disbelief. Chapter 2 Every time I make soup, I have to get up before dawn, letting it simmer on low heat for hours, just because Austin has stomach problems and I want to take care of him. Now, after my miscarriage, after giving her my blood, I'm still expected to wake up early and make soup for her. Austin was truly heartless. He doesn't even notice how pale I am, white as a sheet. Or maybe he does notice‚Äîhe just doesn't care. A sharp pain twists through my abdomen, needles stabbing every inch of my body, but nothing hurts as much as my heart. Seeing me hesitate, Austin's expression darkens. ""Eloise, I've been running around all day. I'm exhausted. I come home to be with you, and you still give me attitude. ""Can't you be more considerate? What wife acts like you, always sulking at her husband? You're just making trouble for no reason!"" I clutch my stomach tightly, but can't help letting out a bitter laugh. ""Maybe we should get divorced. You can go find someone more considerate."" ""Alright, alright, I'm not going to argue with you,"" he dismissed. I look up at Austin, only to see him staring at his phone, not even listening to a word I said. I don't need to look to know‚Äîit's Kayla calling. He grabs his phone and heads straight to the study, barely bothering to respond. ""Go get some sleep. Don't forget to make soup in the morning."" His eyes flickered to the surgical record from my miscarriage sitting on the coffee table, pausing for just a moment. But he still didn't say a word‚Äînot even a hint of concern. I sit there, half-listening as he comforts Kayla. ""Kayla, why are you awake? I only left after I saw you were asleep. ""Didn't you want Eloise's soup? I'll have her make it for you‚ÄîI'll bring it over first thing in the morning."" His gentle tone feels like a knife, twisting deeper into my chest. I just lost my child, and he's busy caring for another woman. I found out I was pregnant four months ago. The whole pregnancy, I was on edge, terrified something would go wrong. The doctor said my health was poor, that I should rest as much as possible in the first few months to keep the baby safe. So I was careful, doing everything I could to protect this precious little life. I used to be healthy, but after donating blood to Kayla so many times, my immunity started to drop. This wasn't my first pregnancy. I had lost others before because of anemia. When I found out I was pregnant this time, I swore I'd do everything to keep this baby. Austin and I had known each other for seven years, married for five, and finally, we were going to have a child together. But because there hadn't been a child for so long, Austin's parents resented me. His mother never missed a chance to blame me. ""I never agreed to this marriage. A hen that doesn't lay eggs‚Äîthe Cadwell family line is going to end with you."" Austin always looked at me with disappointment. ""Who knows when I'll finally have my own kid. You got pregnant and couldn't even be careful‚Äînow look what's happened."" During that time, the pressure nearly crushed me. I developed anxiety, couldn't sleep, and my hair fell out in clumps. I thought, finally, my suffering was over. I'd made it past the dangerous stage. But in the end, I still lost the baby. Maybe the child didn't want to be born into a family like this. I've completely lost hope for this marriage. Tomorrow, I plan to sit down with Austin and talk about getting a divorce. What I didn't expect was that the next morning, as soon as I came downstairs, I was met with Austin's angry accusations. ""Kayla, I'll be over soon. Be good and wait for me‚ÄîI'll bring you breakfast."" His voice was gentle, soothing in a way I'd never heard before. I stood there, stunned, as he hung up and looked up, unexpectedly catching sight of me. Chapter 3 When he realized I'd come down from upstairs, Austin's face contorted in anger. ""You're just getting up now? Didn't I tell you to get up early and make soup? Is it really that hard for you? ""Can't you be a little more mature? Stop getting jealous and throwing tantrums all the time!"" Looking at his smug face, I almost laughed out of sheer frustration. Every time he made a mistake, he'd find a way to blame me, accusing me of blowing things out of proportion and being irrationally jealous. I couldn't even be bothered to argue, turning to walk away. Suddenly, pain shot through my wrist as he yanked me back with such force that I stumbled and fell to the floor. Austin was strong‚Äîhis grip hurt, and I couldn't steady myself before collapsing. He towered over me, eyes blazing with anger and impatience. ""Did I say you could leave? Stop pretending to be weak. Get up."" Cold sweat broke out across my forehead, and my face drained of color. A flicker of panic flashed across Austin's features. ""I didn't pull that hard. You're always making me angry‚Äîwhy can't you just be sweet like Kayla?"" As he spoke, he bent down to pick me up. I tried to struggle, but he grabbed my hands and lifted me anyway. I kicked my legs, fighting back. ""Put me down!"" ""Just behave. Stop squirming."" He set me on the sofa and fetched the first aid kit, tending carefully to the scrapes on my wrist, his expression gentle and his movements cautious. Once, that would have moved me. Back then, every little thing he did made my heart flutter, made me believe he truly loved me. He'd wait in line for hours to buy my favorite pastries. I only mentioned once how beautiful the marshes must be in the rain‚Äîand before I knew it, he'd bought tickets. He learned how to take better photos of me, showered me with compliments, and always tried to make me smile. Little by little, his sincerity won me over, and I agreed to marry him. Watching his serious face now, I couldn't help but wonder how we'd ended up like this. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught the glow of his phone screen‚ÄîWhatsApp messages from the same contact with a heart emoji, clearly from Kayla. ""Austin, where are you? I'm craving pastries from Florian's Bakery. ""You skipped work to take care of me‚Äîwon't Eloise get jealous? If she gets upset, I'll feel so guilty."" Florian's Bakery. So those pastries he always recommended, the ones he'd wait in line for, were actually his beloved crush's favorites. I used to be quiet and reserved, but somewhere along the way, Austin turned me into someone irritable and quick-tempered. He often came home at dawn, sometimes not at all, and whenever I was upset, he'd turn it around and blame me. ""I work my tail off every day, staying late at the office is perfectly normal! I'm doing all this for you, for our family."" At first, every time he said that, guilt gnawed at me. I thought I was just overthinking it. But he wasn't as clever as he thought. I knew the truth‚Äîhe wasn't working late or out networking. He was with Kayla. Austin set a cup of supplement drink in front of me, putting on a show of tenderness. ""Drink up."" The supplement drink had been prescribed by a doctor long ago; every time I gave blood, he'd make me drink it, worried I'd be too weak for the next donation. After I found out I was pregnant, I stopped, afraid it might hurt the baby. Now, watching him go through the motions, I had no appetite at all. I shook my head. ""I don't want it. Just pour it out."" Austin's face darkened. He twisted my body toward him, trying to force me to drink. ""If you're not healthy, you need to take care of yourself. Stop being unreasonable."" The bitter, strange smell brought back memories of all those times I'd forced myself to drink it after donating blood. My stomach turned. ""I said I don't want it! Ugh‚Äî"" I couldn't hold back the nausea. Tears stung my eyes, and my face grew even paler. Austin jumped up, furious, his voice harsh. ""Eloise! Stop being so ungrateful. I skipped work just to make sure you drank your supplement‚Äîisn't that enough? Can't you just listen for once? ""It's just a blood donation for Kayla! Why do you have to make such a fuss? Kayla's my good friend, she's not well‚Äîwhat's the harm in you giving blood a few times? ""I put work aside to comfort you, and you walk all over me. I've been too good to you, that's why you think you can get away with anything!"" His temper flared, and he slammed the cup down. Shards sliced my cheek and arm, but the pain in my abdomen was worse. I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""That's not what I meant. I don't care about you and Kayla, I just‚Äî"" Before I could finish, another wave of pain twisted through my stomach, making me retch, though I hadn't eaten anything‚Äîonly sour bile came up. Austin recoiled in disgust, stepping back and snapping, ""Eloise, can't you control yourself? That's disgusting. Why can't you just be a decent wife? ""You can't have kids, you can't take care of the house‚Äîwhat good are you to me? ""You're such a disappointment."" His words were merciless, blunt, and cruel. If he'd cared about me at all, he would've noticed something was wrong. But he didn't, and I didn't need him to anymore. I wiped my mouth with a tissue, brushing him off. ""Whatever you say."" Without another glance, I headed for my room, Austin's angry shouts echoing behind me. ""Eloise, can you stop making trouble every single day? I regret marrying you. You can't even give me a child, and all you do is make my life miserable. ""Go clean up, and don't call me unless it's important. I don't want to see you."" The front door slammed, and silence settled over the house. I lay on my bed, mind blank, and eventually drifted into a heavy sleep. When I checked my phone, there wasn't a single message from him, but I saw Kayla's latest Instagram post. A candid photo of Austin, captioned, ""Life is hard, but at least I have you."" The first comment was from Austin, ""It won't be hard as long as I'm here."" I calmly closed Instagram and called my doctor to confirm my appointment. Some ties should have been cut long ago. Loving myself is the only right choice. Chapter 4 The next day, I clutched my medical report and called my best friend. Just as I hung up and looked up, I suddenly saw Austin. Our eyes met, and for a moment, we both froze. I thought he'd come looking for me, and I was about to speak, but then I caught sight of the person behind him. I couldn't help but laugh at myself for being so naive. A flash of panic crossed Austin's face, but he quickly composed himself and stepped in front of Kayla, his expression sour. ""So now you're following me? Throwing tantrums at home wasn't enough for you?"" Before I could respond, Kayla stepped forward and wrapped her arm around his, her voice sweet and pleading. ""Austin, don't be so angry. Look at Eloise‚Äîshe's so pale. Maybe she's sick. Don't misunderstand her. ""Eloise, I haven't been feeling well, so Austin came to take care of me. You're so generous, I'm sure you wouldn't make a fuss over something so trivial, right?"" Her innocent look made it seem like she was explaining herself, but I knew she was trying to provoke me. I didn't care anymore. My tone was calm, almost detached. ""Why would I be upset? Isn't it your job to take care of her, Austin?"" I smiled, showing no sign of anger, but Austin's face suddenly darkened. He stared at me, as if trying to read my mind, but I wasn't bothered in the least. I walked right past them, heading to the pharmacy to pick up my medication. ""If there's nothing else, I'll be going."" I hadn't gotten far when Austin caught up and blocked my way, his eyes fixed on the report in my hand. ""What's wrong with you? When did this start? Why didn't you tell me?"" I ignored him and tried to keep walking, but he grabbed my arm. I shook him off, my voice cold. ""It's nothing. It doesn't concern you."" But Austin wouldn't let me go, his tone tense, almost pleading. ""Eloise, I know I've been neglecting you lately, but it's not just my fault. You've been unreasonable from the start. ""And as your husband, you shouldn't keep it from me when you're sick."" He reached for the report, but before he could grab it, a pair of hands shoved him away. My best friend, Mindy Siebert, rushed over and stood protectively in front of me. ""What do you think you're doing? Eloise, how could you marry such a jerk? I'm not letting him get away with it today."" Austin stumbled back, drawing the attention of everyone nearby. Mindy had always been fiercely loyal, her temper short and fiery‚Äîshe had never liked Austin. Her relentless tirade quickly clued everyone in to what was happening. ""What the hell? His wife just had a miscarriage, and now he's forcing her to donate blood to his mistress?"" ""Scumbag. He's trash. Guys like him don't deserve a family."" Austin's face turned ashen, humiliated, and his anger boiled over. ""Crazy. No wonder you two are friends‚Äîjust a pair of lunatics, biting anyone who gets close."" In the chaos, Kayla was shoved and slammed into the wall with a shriek. Seeing his precious girl hurt, Austin snapped and kicked out at Mindy. ""Bitch! How dare you touch Kayla!"" Seeing what was about to happen, I rushed forward to shield Mindy, only to take the full force of Austin's kick in my stomach. I gasped from the pain. Agony twisted through my abdomen, and I curled up, clutching my belly. The pain was so intense I nearly blacked out, and blood began to pour out. The crowd panicked, shouting for a doctor. Even Austin abandoned Kayla and rushed over, frantic. ""Why did you get in the way? Why are you bleeding...?"" I could barely breathe, the emotional and physical torment of the past days pushing me to the brink. Ignoring the hands trying to help me, I forced myself to shove Austin away, slamming the medical report into his chest. I couldn't hold back my scream. ""You wanted to know what's wrong with me? Look for yourself! Open your damn eyes and read it!"" ""I had a miscarriage! Do you see it now?"" Austin stared at the report, eyes wide, disbelief etched across his face. His voice broke with desperation. ""No, no, that can't be true. Babe, tell me it's fake. Tell me this isn't real!"" ""That's just something Mindy made up, right? It can't be true!"" ""Honey, please, tell me...""",0,1756949757.0,Novelnews,2,0.5,False

I'm not asking for advice on how to get into the program, I'm not asking for advice on how to game anything. I'm just curious what folks do with their own focuses. Do you wake up and do it first thing? Is it something you check throughout the day? Do you check it on the train ride home from work? Do you focus on specific types of items? Is this your Christmas Gift source? Do you use it for a new apartment?

I'm just curious to see how people are using the platform and what it's doing for their lives.

I guess it's rude to ask without offering my own, so:

I have piles of various projects and contracts that I'm working on that keep me busy most of the day, and I feel like if I come back late at night like half the items regularly aren't there, so even though I miss some stuff during the day I tend to wake up, make myself a coffee, and open up Amazon Vine for a couple pieces of clothing or some extra pieces of hiking gear or firearm related gear. Lots of little gifts. I've got a TON of sunglasses which is great because I am eternally the person who left their sunglasses in the least accessible places, so now I'm the person who both leaves sunglasses everywhere and magically has another set every time. I've also gotten back into listening to music thanks to this. Not just, like, casually listening to music, I used to purposefully ignore the world and put on an album and focus ON the album but it's neigh impossible to do that on a phone because I'll get reminders of all the projects and clients and things I should be working on interrupting the music. Cheap MP3 players and headphones have made tuning out the world for a pocket of mentally resetting as I take in JUST the music a thing I can do again.

Alt text: Professional business meeting in modern Bahrain office., direct international investment in Bahrain rose 9.7% in Q1 2025, outpacing Gulf neighbors. The World Bank‚Äôs 2025 report pins Bahrain‚Äôs projected real GDP growth at 4.2%, with fintech and digital services leading the charge.\
The Sijilat portal processes over 1,500 commercial registrations per month (Bahrain EDB, June 2025). With the new instant CR renewal program, entrepreneurs cite Bahrain Bay and the Diplomatic Area as top picks for their company HQs‚Äîoffering stunning views and proximity to key ministries.\
For an up-to-date, actionable overview of the process, see Company Formation in Bahrain.\
Bahrain stands out for 99% foreign ownership (no sponsor required in many sectors), fast-tracked CR approvals, and a transparent regulatory framework compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia. But that same transparency comes with sharp penalties for non-compliance‚Äîespecially with VAT.\
VAT Filing in Bahrain: The 2025 Regulatory Snapshot\
The VAT Basics: What Every Company Must Know\
Bahrain introduced VAT in 2019. By 2025, it‚Äôs a streamlined, digital-first system overseen by the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR). Registered businesses must file returns and pay any VAT due every quarter (or monthly if turnover exceeds BHD 3 million).\
Key deadlines:\
* VAT returns and payments must be submitted by the last day of the month following each tax period (e.g., Q1 VAT due by April 30).\
* The process is managed through the NBR VAT e-portal.\
* Late filing or payment leads to swift, automatic penalties‚Äîno reminders.\
2025 Policy Update: Tighter Deadlines, Tech-Driven Enforcement\
Importantly, as of February 2025, a new NBR policy shortened the ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù for late VAT filings‚Äîdown from 15 days to 7 days. After this, financial penalties increase incrementally, and repeat offenders may face business license suspension.\
(Pro tip: Schedule your VAT work during Ramadan‚Äôs shorter office hours‚Äîbefore 2pm‚Äîto avoid system queues. I once spent three hours in line at MOICT in Seef; filing online at 7:45am the next day was a breeze.)\
What Are the Penalties for Late VAT Filing or Payment in Bahrain?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation during regulatory review.\
Late Payment of VAT\
\
2% of the VAT due per month (calculated daily from the payment due date until settled)\
Minimum charge: BHD 50 per late period\
\
Note: Penalties are cumulative‚Äîso late filing plus late payment means you could face both types of fines at once.\
Other Possible Sanctions\
\
Repeated delays can trigger business license suspension by the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT).\
NBR may freeze company bank accounts for serious non-compliance.\
Directors may receive personal liability notices.\
\
Surprisingly, the system is highly automated‚Äîno need for manual reminders. If you miss the deadline, expect instant notification and automatic fine calculation.\
Real-World Example\
I once supported a Bahrain Bay-based import-export SME that missed their VAT filing by just two days due to a missing supporting document. The penalties:\
- BHD 100 fixed for missing the deadline\
- BHD 20 (BHD 10 per day for two days)\
- Plus 2% interest for late payment on BHD 4,000 VAT owed = BHD 80/month\
Total cost for a two-day delay: BHD 200+‚Äîmoney that would have covered a month‚Äôs office utilities.\

- Set reminders for VAT deadlines‚ÄîBahrain‚Äôs eGovernment apps sync with Google Calendar.\
2. Prepare Documents in Advance\
\
Upload all invoices and supporting evidence weekly, not at quarter-end.\
Keep a digital audit trail; the NBR‚Äôs system accepts PDF scans, but originals may be required during audits.\
\
3. Opt for Pro Help\
\
Many SMEs use affordable monthly services from local compliance firms (BHD 80‚Äì250/month for VAT filing).\
Trusted providers like KeyLink Accounting & Bookkeeping offer VAT deadline monitoring, saving you time and fines.\
\
4. Choose the Right Office Location\
\
Offices in Seef District and Bahrain Financial Harbour are seconds from both MOICT and NBR headquarters‚Äîhandy for urgent submissions or resolving disputes in person.\
Avoid peak hours on Sunday mornings; late afternoons on Wednesdays are quieter (trust me‚Äîafter Ramadan, 3pm on a Wednesday at the NBR is ghostly empty).\
\
5. Utilize Tamkeen & EDB Services\
\
Tamkeen support programs cover up to 50% of regulatory service fees for new and small companies.\
Bahrain EDB‚Äôs concierge service (based at Bahrain Bay) assists with VAT registration for foreign investors.\

- Optimal application timing: File returns online between 7:30am‚Äì9:30am for minimal portal lag‚Äîbypass lunch-hour slowdowns.\
Tangent: Office Coffee Rituals & Regulatory Focus\

Potential Pitfalls: Common Mistakes (And How I Fixed Mine)\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain.\
Many foreign entrepreneurs wrongly assume they‚Äôll get a warning before a penalty hits. You won‚Äôt. Bahrain‚Äôs system is automatic. The first time I filed late, I hoped for grace. Instead, the penalty was immediate‚Äîno appeals.\
Prevention:\
- Set multiple reminders (phone, cloud, email).\
- Assign VAT compliance to one designated person, not shared among staff.\
- Use local expert advisors; their monthly VAT monitoring fees are tiny compared to a single penalty.\
Challenge Faced: Document Mismatch\
I once struggled with mismatched invoice numbers due to a software update. The NBR portal flagged the error, delaying my submission by one day. The fix: I switched to a Bahrain-based accounting platform with built-in NBR compliance, dramatically cutting risk for future filings.\

it literally just happened with a girl i was talking to that i met at a coffee shop. i became attached too fast and it felt like she was reciprocating my feelings, but then when i asked her out she started acting skittish. i shouldve just left it alone then and there, but i kept going back and she started flirting again so i admitted my feelings again and she ran again. still kept going back and the same thing happened, except she asked me if i wanted to work at her job since i was looking for one. i told her i didnt think it was a good idea because i still had feelings and didnt want to bring that into a work environment. she began acting weird again and then ever since then shes ghosted me. 

i think its a blessing in disguise because obviously this thing wont work out, but im still mentally stuck on her. it feels like when id call my dad and he wouldnt answer or call back for days on end. we talk a lot more now, but i still feel like i cant really trust him or let him in, just like i cant let people enter my circle platonically. i know people think im cool and they really want to get to know me but everytime they get close i shut off and push them away. i really dont know what to do or how to unlearn these habits i built. i think its a good thing i finally have some semblance of an answer of whats doing this though",2,1756948956.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

There are nights I replay in my mind like scenes from a novel I never got to finish, moments threaded with laughter, glances, and the kind of tension that lingers long after the lights go out. Nights I wish I‚Äôd been braver. Bolder with my heart.

We‚Äôd spent countless evenings together, sometimes wrapped in the noise of our friends, sometimes just the two of us, sitting quietly in the orbit of each other's gravity. But there were a few nights I cant forget.

One evening last summer, I was invited out for drinks with friends. I was late getting back to town, so I arrived late. You were already there, sitting with your son, fresh off a day on the golf course and with a drink in hand and you shot me that smile that always unraveled me a little. As I sat down, you leaned in and said

‚Äúmy god, you‚Äôre beautiful.‚Äù And then, as if it needed repeating, again: ‚ÄúSeriously. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶so beautiful.‚Äù

The words clung to the air like smoke, slow, delicate, curling into the corners of me that hadn‚Äôt been touched in a long time. I laughed it off, unsure what to do with the warmth spreading through my chest or the way your eyes lingered just a moment too long.

Later, amid the chatter of the group, I wanted to point out something happening across the room. My hand brushed your upper thigh (a soft, unintentional graze) and before I could stammer out an apology, you turned to me, smirking. ‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù you said, your voice low, teasing eyes playful. ‚ÄúYou almost touched it.‚Äù My face went hot. I laughed awkwardly, tripping over a half-formed apology as heat rose to my cheeks. Our friends confused by what was said in our side conversation, but you didn‚Äôt pull away. You just smiled and kept laughing, stealing glances, like the moment meant nothing.

Or maybe it meant everything.

We moved through the evening like we always did, subtle glances, fingertips brushing, gentley stroking forarms, words unspoken. A stranger with a dog passed by us and while we were loving on the dog she asked, ‚ÄúAre you two together?‚Äù I started to answer, but you beat me to it. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù you said, and I echoed you a second too late. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the stranger added with a smile, ‚Äúyou two look good together, think about it.‚Äù You glanced at me, amused. I laughed, but inside‚Ä¶ I wondered. Was the universe trying to show us something? Was that what everyone else saw, this wasn't the first time we've heard this, is it something we were too afraid to name?

Just before we left, we were standing beside my sons friend Logan, he was asking questions and the conversation had shifted to marriage, he shared he was excited to get married the following weekend. We joked about not doing it, do t do it, You laughed and said you were ‚Äúworking on your third marriage, and gesturd in my direction.‚Äù I smiled, but inside, I paused.

Your third.

Were you referring to me?

I didn‚Äôt ask. I didn‚Äôt want to assume. But when I stepped aside to let someone pass and backed into you, your hands instinctively found my hips, steadying me. For a breath, we didn‚Äôt move.

We fit.

The realization landed with quiet certainty the shape of your body behind mine, the warmth, the way your hands hesitated before letting go. We fit in a way that didn't need words.

I wonder‚Ä¶ did you feel it too?

Am I your third?

But we were just friends. Right?

That night, alone in my bed, I couldn‚Äôt stop replaying it. The way your voice dipped when you called me beautiful. The teasing touch. The stranger‚Äôs knowing smile. The almost.

And I wondered‚Ä¶

What if I hadn‚Äôt laughed? What if I hadn‚Äôt apologized? What if, instead, I‚Äôd met your gaze and whispered, ‚ÄúMaybe I wanted to touch it.‚Äù Or smiled and said, ‚ÄúMaybe Im just trying to make a new friend.‚Äù

What if?

One night last fall, after bar-hopping and pizza with friends, you played with my hair to get my attention, and had your hand on the small of my back, almost the entire night. It felt like we were a couple.

But we tell everyone we're just friends, right?

We left there and walking up the street stopping just outside another favorite establishment. There was live music playing, the air sharp with autumn. Neither of us wanted to go home yet. We said goodnight to our friends, and found two empty seats at the bar and asked the bartender for their astrology book, because of course we did.

We laughed reading it together, flipping through the pages, pretending the stars had all the answers. I read your birthday horoscope aloud, your arm slung around the back of my chair and my shoulders. I was nestled into you, drawn by your warmth more than the whiskey in my veins. Longing for more than just your arm and the familiar warmth wrapped around me.

Your neighbor struck up a conversation with you about learning they are having his first baby, and how parenting is the most amazing experience right. Somehow the conversation turned to body grooming, he asked if you shaved. I asked If I heard him correctly, you turned to me, sharing the conversation, with your neighbor, we laughed. ‚ÄúWell, do you groom?‚Äù I asked, raising a brow. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù you said, your voice low almost a whisper but your eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúI had to for my previous job, but don't now, and I don‚Äôt care what you have going on down there either, full bush, strip or bald, Guys don‚Äôt care about that kind of thing, we just want in.‚Äù I said it will just have to be a surprise for you then.

There was heat in your gaze, a flicker of something deeper. I stared at your lips, wondering what they felt like. You leaned in closer, and tried to kiss me.

For a heartbeat, I almost let you. But then, I turned away. Our faces almost touching, your breath, heavy on my neck. My breath in your ear.

My heart thudded, a tangle of nerves and fear and disbelief. I don‚Äôt know why I pulled back. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt ready. Maybe I was scared. But the moment shattered, and I felt it, the regret. Immediate and sharp.

If only I could go back, if only.

A few weeks later out with the same friends, enjoying drinks, laughs and good company. You stealing my shot, with that devilsh grin. That night, you stepped away to use the restroom, kissing the back of my head as you passed behind me.

One friend disappeared after dancing, and the other struggled to stand upright,and kept falling so we had to walk her home.

After you secured the door of her apartment, you commented how you liked how I locked the door behind us. I said, I wanted to keep her safe. We began down the stairs, you offered your hand as I stepped down, and we held hands the entire six block walk back to my car. When we arrived, we turned to each other embracing fully, our arms around each others waist. Looking at each other, the moment was electric. I stared into your eyes and probably lingered in your arms a little too long, when I desperately wanted to kiss you. I think you felt it too. You held me like you didn‚Äôt want to let go. Staring at me like you were trying to memorize me, or you had a thousand words to say to me. None of them coming out. Me screaming inside ""just tell me how you feel about me.""

And again‚ÄîI did nothing.

A few weeks later after Oktoberfest. You invited me over for beers after everyone was starting to retreat back home, your hand was on the small of my back as I stood next to you. There was something softer in your voice, something hesitant. A tender look in your eye. I surveyed the group to see of anyone else heard the invite, realizing no one had, I said raincheck? I'm so tempted by you, don't trust myself alone with you.

I wonder what would‚Äôve happened if I‚Äôd said yes. If I‚Äôd followed you home. If we‚Äôd let the night stretch into something more.

Would things have been different?

Would we?

But, we're just friends, right?

I get lost in the idea of slipping into your arms, away from the world‚Äôs eyes, into something secret and sacred, it thrills me. There‚Äôs something wickedly beautiful about the fantasy. Something irresistible. My mind wanders too easily: to your hands, your mouth, your breath and lips at my neck. To the quiet hush of a room where time stops. To the way it might feel to finally give in.

But then, my conscience speaks, and I ask myself, what if he doesn't feel the same?

And I pull back.

So I stay here‚Ä¶ suspended in this quiet ache. Wanting. Yearning. Yearning for the warmth of your body against mine. Yearning for mornings rolling out of your bed wrapped in your T-shirt, barefoot in your kitchen, making you coffee like it‚Äôs the most natural thing in the world.

As if we were something real.

And I realize loving someone who belongs to someone else is a quiet torment, every smile they give feels like a gift not meant for you, and every moment without them echoes like a wound that never quite heals.

# Background

With smart money like the Galkins continuing to accumulate Newegg shares for long term ownership, even at $107 per share as shown in recent filings, how will dumb-money (and trapped) short sellers ever get this deep-value stock to a price low enough where they can make it out of the 547%+ borrow rates alive?  Didn't these rookies learn from 2021 (and 2024), that when the price of good companies are cheap enough compared to their calculated value, that international households (it's not just one husband and wife out of Miami, Florida who are buying) and forward-seeing institutions literally buy the entire company out?

Newegg, in its half year earnings, outperformed.  There was a positive derivative: growth in every available measure.  But we are still seeing hundreds of thousands of new fails-to-deliver (FTDs).  So, do these lunatics really think they can forcefully utilize new fails-to-deliver (FTDs) to drive Newegg closer to a manageable price for settlement of their prior-month FTDs?  I think of that like scraping the skin off an apple.  That might allow them to save a few dollars on their actual, interest-paying short positions.  But, the price is now discounted over $100 off from the price about a week ago.  Was getting the price to $31 the best they could do?

Some of our cost bases are around $3.  Many of us are still up about 1,000%x and comfortably sipping coffee.  Many also began investing around $20.  They're still up too on their investments, and at one point, people thought $20 was ""high"" until they taste-tested $138 a week ago.  Anyway, there is no indication that smart money is ever walking away from Newegg: an important, futuristic-wheel of a tech company.  Bigwigs like the Galkin Family only began investing into Newegg a few weeks ago, and have already amassed 3.52 Million shares.  And for that reason, alongside institutional and household demand to own Newegg stock, the borrow rate to short Newegg is still 547%.

Newegg's intrinsic valuation, as shown below, is justified and supported at around $1,000 per share, rather than the $138 that Newegg was trading at a week ago. I find that the long term spikiness is revealing of that real value: $1,581 per Newegg share in 2021 and >$2,000 per Newegg share in 2014.  With the stock price today back at $1.54 in pre-reverse-split numbers, and the stock is discounted substantially again, and back near its all time lows.  Let's study this opportunity.

So far, there have been four legs to Newegg's ongoing price runup.  Let us look at them more closely, by duration and magnitude.  Let's also compare the duration of the overall runup to past runups (assuming it is of the same behavior).

# Technicals of the Overall, Ongoing Runup:

[The average of the prior noteworthy runups is 168 trading days.  The current runup has only elapsed for half that time.](https://preview.redd.it/yimmpdafk1nf1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=3984ccbb40212289d1cd8467536e6e5eb1a78a5c)

# Technicals of the Previous Cooldown After 'Leg 4':

[Legs 1-3 of this runup each had thorough cooldowns, lasting 9.33 trading days on average and averaging a decline of 50.33&#37;.  The rate of decline has also been growing on each leg, which could explain why the conclusion of Leg 4 has seen a cooldown beyond 55&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/vzowz8ghk1nf1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ef8c820d2314e3ebdbb763e940300875877b4a)

These technicals reveal that Newegg's ongoing runup has only lasted for half of the time that the runups normally last (assuming this is only assuming that we are not in a new, long-term uptrend).  Additionally, this price cooldown (after Leg 3 reached $137.84) has already cooled down further than the -50.33% average of the first three legs; cooldowns.  And this cooldown is close to reaching the average cooldown length of 9.33 trading days, all of which suggest that Newegg is now 'very oversold'.

# Applying Price-to-Sales Ratios to Newegg's Past Performance:

The current price-to-sales ratio for the S&P 500 in January 2025 is around 2.84.  Price-to-Sales ratio is a valuation metric, which shows P/S for applicable industries are 4.588 (tech hardware and peripherals), 6.009 (semiconductor equipment), and 5.57 internet/software). That's 5.389 on average.  If we include software, we are at 11.26, but I won't include software in order to remain conservative.

Newegg's market cap right now is $634.204M and sales per annum around $1.31B. So, Newegg's P/S is currently 0.484. So yeah: this compared to 5.389 is saying that Newegg's stock price in the short term should be 1,113.14%x today's price, or $344.74 per share.  If we include software, A.I. products, or the cryptoasset Mining industry's P/S, then we are around $1,000.00 per share by past P/S alone.  Note that this is not even forward looking, and does not even consider that Newegg's half year earnings show that we are on track to be profitable again next quarter.

# Applying Price-to-Sales Ratios to Newegg's Forward-Looking Valuation:

To apply the provided price-to-sales (P/S) ratios in a forward-looking manner, I used the first-half 2025 sales of $695.7 million as a base, annualizing to approximately $1.39 billion for the full year (consistent with the earnings report). However, incorporating the company's reported 12.6% year-over-year sales growth and additional tailwinds from A.I. hardware demand (e.g., rapid sell-outs of Nvidia RTX 50 series GPUs), cryptoasset-related hardware sales (e.g., mining rigs during crypto market recoveries), and the Nvidia partnership (exclusive allocations boosting high-margin revenue), I project 2026 forward sales at $1.6 billion (assuming 15% growth, conservative given 14% GMV increase in H1 2025 and AI-driven GPU/CPU surges).

Benchmarks are:

* S&P 500 P/S: 2.84 (January 2025, but as of September 2025, it's holding around 2.8-3.0 based on market data).
* Tech hardware and peripherals: 4.588.
* Semiconductor equipment: 6.009.
* Internet/software: 5.57.
* Average of the three: 5.389.
* Including pure software: 11.26 (elevated due to high-growth A.I./software valuations).

Newegg's exposure to A.I. (as a key retailer for A.I.-enabling hardware like GPUs, with platform integrations for A.I. tools) and cryptoasset (selling mining equipment and accepting BTC/ETH payments, benefiting from crypto volatility) positions it beyond a traditional retailer like Amazon (P/S \~3.5). Instead, it aligns more with tech/hardware and semi-adjacent firms, warranting a premium multiple. For instance, as A.I. demand explodes (projected global A.I. hardware market growth of 25-30% annually through 2030), Newegg's specialized e-commerce focus could capture outsized share, similar to how semiconductor firms trade at higher P/S. Updated outstanding shares: Approximately 20.48 million (from recent SEC filings as of August 2025).

**Forward P/S Valuation Scenarios Using projected 2026 sales of $1.6 billion:**

|Multiple Applied|Rationale|Implied Market Cap ($B)|Intrinsic Value Per Share|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2.84 (S&P 500)|Baseline broad-market valuation; conservative for a growth-oriented tech retailer.|4.54|$233|
|4.588 (Tech Hardware/Peripherals)|Matches Newegg's core business in PC components and peripherals, boosted by Nvidia exclusives.|7.34|$377|
|6.009 (Semiconductor Equipment)|Reflects indirect exposure via selling semi-related hardware (e.g., GPUs for A.I./chips for mining).|9.61|$493|
|5.57 (Internet/Software)|Aligns with e-commerce platform and emerging A.I. integrations (e.g., A.I.-driven recommendations and community features).|8.91|$457|
|5.389 (Average of Hardware/Semi/Internet)|Balanced view incorporating all exposures.|8.62|$443|
|11.26 (Including Pure Software)|Premium for A.I./software-like growth; Newegg's platform evolves toward A.I. personalization and crypto ecosystems, akin to high-margin software firms.|18.02|$925|

These alone imply a range of $233-925 per share. The higher end (e.g., 11.26x) is justified forward-looking due to Newegg's AI push‚Äîsuch as AI-integrated shopping tools and high-demand for AI hardware‚Äîwhich could drive sales growth to 20-25% annually if cryptoasset mining hardware sales rebound with crypto prices (e.g., post-halving cycles). This exceeds Amazon-like retail (low-margin, broad) by leveraging niche tech moats.

# But Why Should Newegg be Fairly Priced At $1,000 Per Share?:

$1,000 per share today means $50 in pre-reverse-split numbers (i.e., prior to April 7th, 2025). While traditional analyst targets for NEGG hover around $60-67 (e.g., average 1-year price target of $67 from Wall Street firms, with a Hold rating), some expert analyses and market dynamics suggest a far higher potential of $1,000 per share under optimistic but fundamentally sound scenarios.

This isn't mere speculation; it's grounded in Newegg's unique positioning, low float dynamics, and explosive growth levers in A.I. and cryptoasset ecosystems. At $1,000/share with 20.48 million shares, the implied market cap is $20.48 billion‚Äîrequiring a forward P/S of \~12x on $1.6 billion sales (or lower if sales double to $3 billion by 2027 via A.I./crypto booms). High-growth tech firms like Nvidia trade at 30x+ P/S during peaks, making this achievable as Newegg executes.

Here are fundamental reasons, drawing from expert opinions (e.g., chart-based targets up to $710 and deep-dive analyses on squeeze potential):

1. **Ultra-Low Float Enabling the ""Silent Squeeze"" Dynamics**: Newegg's float is extraordinarily low at \~406,000 shares (with insiders holding \~95%+), creating extreme supply scarcity.  One egg bro investor described this as a ""silent squeeze"" setup (similar to GameStop but without the noise) where even modest buying pressure (e.g., from insider purchases like the Galkin Family's recent aggressive buys) can rocket the price.  With short interest potentially building (shares short \~ some volume in August 2025), a catalyst like additional insider buying or strong Q3 earnings could force covering, pushing shares to $1,000 as liquidity continues to evaporate. This is rational: Low-float stocks have historically surged 1,000%+ on fundamentals alone (e.g., micro-caps in tech booms).
2. **A.I. Exposure as a High-Margin Growth Engine**: Newegg isn't just a retailer; its A.I.-integrated platform (launched in 2025) uses A.I. for personalized recommendations, inventory optimization, and community features, driving 30%+ stock surges post-announcement. Experts note this positions Newegg to capture the $200B+ A.I. hardware market by 2030, with Nvidia partnerships ensuring exclusive access to high-demand GPUs (e.g., RTX series sell-outs in hours). If A.I. adoption accelerates (as projected in industry reports), Newegg's sales could triple to $4-5 billion by 2028, justifying a 20x+ P/S multiple like pure A.I. plays. Chart analysts already target $710 for 2025 based on this trajectory, and scaling for further growth hits $1,000.
3. **Cryptoasset Mining and Crypto Ecosystem Upside**: Newegg participates via hardware sales (mining rigs, GPUs) and BTC acceptance, benefiting from cryptoasset cycles. With the primary cryptoasset potentially hitting $150K+ post-2024 halving (per mining industry reports), demand for mining equipment could surge 50%+, adding $500M+ in revenue. Analysts in cryptoasset mining spaces highlight how firms with AI/crypto overlap (e.g., miners pivoting to AI data centers) see valuation multiples expand dramatically‚ÄîNewegg could mirror this, with experts estimating $37B+ NPV from similar arbitrage plays. Combined with A.I., this creates a dual-revenue flywheel, rationally supporting $1,000 if crypto rebounds.
4. **Turnaround Fundamentals and Insider Confidence**: H1 2025 showed 26.5% gross profit growth and positive adjusted EBITDA ($11.3M), signaling profitability inflection. With net cash position and low debt, Newegg has room for acquisitions (e.g., into AI services). Insider buying (19 purchases in 6 months) signals conviction, and value analyses argue the stock's 0.5x current P/S is a deep discount to peers. If earnings hit $1/share by 2027 (plausible with margins expanding to 10% on AI highs), a 1,000x PE isn't needed‚Äîjust sustained 50% growth, as seen in tech turnarounds.
5. **Market Precedents and Momentum**: Stocks like Tesla or Nvidia reached similar per-share heights through ecosystem dominance. Newegg's tech enthusiast community (new launches driving engagement) creates network effects, per expert views. Combined with volatility (e.g., more than 4,000.00% return from May to August 2025, and now  having consolidated and only up 1,100.00%), $1,000 is rational in this bull case as A.I./crypto converge, as outlined in squeeze theses.

# TLDR:

Technicals above show that Newegg stock ($NEGG) is now 'very oversold'.  Leg 4's cooldown here has also elapsed to nearly the average duration of Leg 1-3's cooldowns.  These cooldowns are routine, and reveal that the next leg (Leg 5) is slated to begin.  A full analysis was conducted above, by P/S (past and forward) among other points point to $233 - $925 per share as being fair today.  Today's price became quite discounted again at only $31.  But the $1,000/share anticipation for $NEGG here is based on A.I./Cryptoasset catalysts continuing to materialize.  Fundamentals like low float, growth levers, and newfound 'squeeze' analyses (being finally made public today) really do make $1,000/share justifiable and defensible.  This is is not hype, and this is definitely not a so-called ""pemp and demp"". This is a high-conviction outcome as public execution aligns.",2,1756948722.0,WallStreetbetsELITE,1,1.0,False

Be Warned!!","Hopefully this helps someone planning to buy stuff for their computer setups. IMO if you spend your hard earned money you need support from the company you supported by buying from them right? . Logitech and its bs methods of ""support?"" ... if you can use that word ..is such a joke ..big company masquerading as a rip off artist... get the people to spend their hard earned money for one of our devices and then couple years later we'll dump them so they have to replace a still perfect working device . Leaves a bad taste in your mouth as it did for me. So beware people...i recommend NOT buying from them . Hear that Logitech? In future not a  dollar from me for anything!! And to think i used to think their stuff wasn't too bad. But if the company behind it doesn't give a crap about you or support you...then why support them. End of story. Wake up and smell the coffee Logitech... All you had to do is update a driver that will be accepted by the new Windows driver signing standards.. and you did NOTHING!!!  One great example is the cameras they push...theres so many bad experiences with them out there you cant even count that high. 

Oh and on their software... its worse than bad.. way it installs its like dumping one big BLOB of ""stuff ""in your registry that you don't need and when it comes to installing another device later to hopefully make it work with no conflicts you have to spend a couple hours cleaning out all the garbage that's dumped there like i just did, that you didn't even need to begin with.

I think I have Stockholm-syndrome?,"I know, it isn't as serious or awful to most people, as it might come off from my post. The fact is, it isn't even that she forgot, but the circumstances.

She hasn't had a job since January and since then the world revolves around her. She is depressed - 'poor me, I slept for 12 hours'. She is hurting everyday - 'poor me I can't workout, because I'm lazy and my knees and back hurting'. She has thyroid issues - 'poor me, again, no insurance'. Oh, she could sell her house for about 400+ thousand and pay off all her debt and move to a smaller house - 'poor me, what will my oversea family see?? A failing woman who was taking care of her family?? I must keep the image that I can do everything I damn well want, so I'll order yarn for hundreds of dollars monthly or make my husband make food and coffee and bring it upstair for me so I dont even have to get out of my chair, I'll still doordash all my food, and I will buy an $80 chair for myself for knitting. Oh, and I'll also buy whiskey and whatnot, because I don't have the money' 

She's a damn alcoholic who doesn't care about wishes, or doesn't care about boundaries. I swear, while I was living with her, I had 3 kids. Her, and my actual 2. 

She doesn't like my partner, because he actually stood up for me after she's been just about anything, but nice to me and was constantly making comments about me, how I am, or what I am doing. So she hates him. 

She's abused my sister (she once literally beat her with her walker, while my sister's leg was broken, or the other time when she actually bit her on the arm), and me, she's beaten us, controlled us, and did everything in her power to make sure we depend on her. And now, that we are out of the nest, she's desperate. She still caused a fight today, even if it was my birthday. And she didn't care, or actually forgot to say Happy Birthday to me. 

I want to keep in touch with her, but at this point, I can't take her emotional abuse anymore. But then there's the fact the financially she did help me and my family out with diapers, clothes, baby stuff and I feel guilty for not wanting to talk to her.

I moved to the US 6 years ago with no English knowledge, yet I had to drive her to and from her lover's home after she got so drunk, she picked a fight with that piece of junk who is now dead because he OD'd.

I told her I don't want her to drink while I'm there and can see her, or around my kids, because I have PTSD form when she was really bad and she blamed me for it and told me it's my problem, I have to deal with it and continued drinking while I'd get panick attacks and almost pass out from hyperventilating.

I want my mom. I want A mom. I want my kids to have a grandma. 

MY grandma raised me. My grandma was an angel. How the heck could my mom become a monster? 

It is seriously just a vent. There's so much information I just can't write down because that would take weeks. I probably could write a book about it. The constant bully and abuse. And now she forgot about me.

I'm wondering if I could do better topping with *The Message* as another option for the blue shimmer, but I really don't have a good sense if that would improve the look.

1n7wnr8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7wnr8,"The Last Brew: Dieter Rams Coffee Maker, Rebuilt for the End Times","What happens to good design when civilization collapses?

This is a functional wooden reconstruction of Dieter Rams' iconic KF20 Aeromaster - the coffee maker that defined modernist kitchen aesthetics in the 70s. But instead of pristine plastic and chrome, its built from scavenged wood and salvaged hardware, paired with a JetBoil as the heat source.

Rams believed good design could create a better world. His ten principles of design assumed abundance, mass production, social progress. But what if that utopian future never arrived? What if instead of sleek consumer goods, we had to rebuild beauty from whatever materials survived?

**The brutal truth: his proportions still work.** The golden ratio doesn't care about your supply chain. Honest materials don't need injection molding. Function-driven form survives any apocalypse.

This maintains Rams essential design DNA - the cylindrical proportions, material honesty, the ""less but better"" philosophy - while acknowledging that ""better"" might mean ""actually brewable when you're running on camping gear.""

Inscription reads: ""The last brew. Beauty is not a luxury."" Because even at the end of everything, humans choose to make things beautiful. We dont just survive - we survive *well*.

**Tech specs:** Fully functional pour-over system. Wood body houses glass dripper with integrated spout. JetBoil provides the heat. Built to last through whatever comes next.

Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is prove that good design principles are more permanent than the civilization that created them.

Writing sample: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed.

In 2023, my best friend (23M) and I (22M) went to a concert in Detroit to see a band play. We get to Detroit around 3:30 and the concert isn‚Äôt until 8:00, so we go out to a bar and end up hitting it off with these two guys, who I‚Äôm going to call Jacob and Aaron. We end up going up to their hotel room got drunk and had a 4-some. We get the deed done, and because I‚Äôm so drunk, I trip over a table leg, then fall forward to where my arm and part of my chest smashes through the glass coffee table. So now, my arm is completely cut up and bleeding and I‚Äôm freaking out because I may be drunk, but I was still afraid of blood. My friend had to calm me down, and he, Jacob and Aaron (who were all three wasted beyond comprehension) drove me to the ER where I ended up have to get stitches in four separate parts of my arm and chest. We had to stay overnight for observation and by morning the ER let us go home. We got back to town around 2:30ish in the afternoon, and pull into my driveway to my mom and dad, sitting on the front steps with two police officers. Because I never told them where I was going, they called the fucking cops. In the end, my mom gave a stern talking to and my dad was just completely silent. They still to this day don‚Äôt know that the reason I tripped over that table leg was because I was drunk and trying to get railed. Oops",11,1756947559.0,story,10,0.77,False

I made eclairs and my first batch i took them out of the oven immediately and they deflated. I understand thats on me as i didnt read the recipe carefully. 

My second batch i left them in the oven after it is done to cool down, you can see its deflated still in the oven (top left of photo) and when i finally took them out, i realised that even the ones that dont look deflated are actually deflated, just from the bottom instead of visibly from the top. 

My oven goes into appliance cooling down mode when i turn it off, and i guess maybe theres a fan going inside. Do you think that is why? Is it a matter of just turning the oven off completely to skip the appliance cooling mode? Or maybe something else i should be doing differently?
