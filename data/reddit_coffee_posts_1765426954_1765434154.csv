1pjqgl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1pjqgl5/life_after_5_10_years_after_cat/,Life after 5 & 10 years after CAT,"Hey folks, recently I saw a bunch of posts regarding call predictions, interview tips and so on. Those took me back to my days and I recalled the anxiety, excitement and the overall emotional rollercoaster I went through during that time and after. So, I thought I'd try to paint a picture of how the next 5-10 years post CAT look like. But again, these are from my experiences and the environment I was in. Not all would have the same thoughts and experiences, but this might give you some directional idea. I'm not sure what's the takeaway for you, but please try to take the positives only.

Brief about myself: 
BTech + MBA (top 10) --> E-commerce + Tech (FAANG)
7 years of post MBA experience (not 10 yet, but not much changes after one point) 

Breaking it down into 5 sections: 
1. Pre MBA
Time from now to the first day in Bschool
2. During MBA
3. Post MBA (till 3 years) 
4. Post MBA (3-6 years) 
5. Post MBA (6-10 years)

As you can imagine this is gonna be a long post and frankly I'm keeping it raw, hence you might find the flow a little unstructured.

Ok, let's start then. Grab a cup of coffee, and imagine we're in a coffee chat.

Pre MBA:
Excitement level: 8
Anxiety level: 7

a. You'd be playing a game of darts in the next few weeks/months. Some would hit, some won't. In some you'd feel you nailed it but end up with a waitlist impossible to convert. Be ready for it, since you won't control 100% of the outcomes from this point forward in life.
b. Stay curious in general. A lot of information dump is coming your way in the next 2-3 years. A lot. Join some interview prep workshop if you want, it'd help digesting the information in a slightly structured manner. 
c. Don't quit your job just yet. You don't want the anxiety levels to shoot.
d. Ask yourself ""why MBA"", not for the interviews, but genuinely to yourself. Most of you would probably hear back utter nonsense and that's okay coz you don't know much yet. But even if a small fraction of you get an answer, that'd define your next 3 years.

MBA:
Excitement level: 9
Anxiety level: 9

a. First 6 months would feel like you haven't experienced before. I've seen people cry, go silent & disconnected. You'd be sleeping 8 hours on a very good day. 
b. Your summer internship prep would begin the day you enter the institute. Managing lecturer, assignments, resume, interview prep, case studies, committite selections, parties, would feel tiring. It'd become a cocktail, some of you would get the high and enjoy and some would lose energy after first few shots and hope the party to end soon. 
c. Remember when I said that you don't control 100% of the outcomes anymore in life? Your summers would tattoo this into your memory. You might not make it to shortlists, you might fail to clear even a single interview out of 10 shortlists on Day 0. You'd see a lot of folks around you breaking at this point. Be kind. 
d. After summers life would be better, much better. 
e. If you get the PPO, life's good, if not, you'd be okay. You'd be a battle tested soldier by now and would fare much better in finals than you did in Summers. 
e. Couple of personal suggestions: decide what you want from your MBA. DO NOT FALL INTO PEER PRESSURE. Join a committee only if it excites you, not coz it's aspirational. Nothing would come as free lunch. Also, make 2-3 great friends for life. Stand by them, help them, cry and laugh with them. That's the only thing which would stay after 5 years.

Post MBA (1-3 years) 
Excitement level: 10
Anxiety: 6

a. You've done it. Your first MBA job. Money is coming and going into Tax and EMIs but heck let's party. And you should party. Date as much as you can and find a partner to settle with. Upto you really, don't do this and marry someone you barely know, or date someone and marry someone who's a friend now and have been with you through some shit. 
b. If campus placements weren't kind to you, jump ship within 1-2 year and don't work a profile you're not enjoying just cuz the money is good or you're comfortable. Do it as soon as possible even if it means pay cut.
c. Remind yourself ""My career is a marathon and not a sprint"". 
d. From day 1, prepare for your next role. That could be a company change, promotion or anything. Have a goal.
e. Be your own manager. Don't take your problems to your manager, go to him with solutions. Believe me he/she's tired. 
f. Develop the saving habit, even if small amounts. But do party as well.

Post MBA (4-6 years) 
Excitement level: 7
Anxiety: 5

a. You're most probably married or about to. You're a grown man/woman.
b. Expectations start to increase from work and society. 
c. You've paid off your education loans, and now saving for life choices, house, car or financial independence. Take this seriously.
d. Your career would start to get shaped and compounding starts. It'd be difficult to change roles after this point, not impossible but may come at a cost. You'd also start understanding your personality and interests better. 

I'd share the post MBA (6-10 years) depending if this was useful, coz that's come with certain assumptions since I'm also only at 7 years so far.",1,1765434036.0,CATpreparation,1,1.0,False

I run a small NZ coffee company and I’m looking for someone friendly and confident who’s keen on a super flexible side gig around Christchurch.

The job is simple: •	Walk into office buildings •	Drop off free coffee samples •	Have a quick friendly chat •	Log it in a form

That’s literally it. No selling, no cold calling, no pressure. I handle all the follow-ups and sales — you just do the fun part.

Pay: You earn recurring commission for every office that signs up: •	Small office: $20/month for 3 months •	Standard office: $50/month for 3 months •	Medium/Large offices: 50% of the GP (after shipping) for 3 months → Bigger offices can earn you $100+ per month for 3 months.

1pjqcbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pjqcbe/ive_had_a_mysterious_mentalphysical_illness_for/,I've had a mysterious mental/physical illness for 10+ years. Does anyone want to take a gander at it?,"**Background**


I was a pretty normal guy until shortly after 2nd year(2015) of my engineering undergrad. In college I soon noticed myself becoming apathetic to stuff everyone cared about like the popular movies or hanging out with friends/family. At the time I thought it was a phase, but that apathy kept expanding and within a few years (2017) it encompassed my entire life except surfing internet and sleep. I'll break it down below (all the symptoms are chronic):


**Symptoms**

*Apathy* - I still feel emotions, but they're 1/10 as strong as they once were. Like they're frozen or trapped in deep ice. Life is basically flat, and compared to the average person I don't feel emotions at all - to the extent of letting my life fall apart because nothing feels important. Any emotion I do feel occurs only once, as a response to new stimuli. Even if I do that same thing again after that, it goes back to feeling like nothing.


*Anhedonia* - Nothing is enjoyable. When I get home from work, I watch youtube or sleep. Doing anything else is expending energy for no return. Everything that used to feel good (talking with people, watching movies, listening to falling rain) is just empty. 


*Reduced sensitivity* - My hearing is like that of an old man. Often people standing right next to me address me and I don't notice because it's so soft I assume they're far away. My sense of smell doesn't work unless I put something right under my nose and inhale very hard. Food tastes like cardboard. Sex feels like always wearing a condom. And strangely I think my eyes see less color than before. This also extends to various drugs - alcohol no longer gives me a buzz (though I still get the lowered inhibitions + spinny room thing). Day and night feel the same.


*Memory loss* - Nearly all my past memories are gone. Details of shows I watched, people I hung out with, games I played, my childhood, it's all gone. Putting new things into memory is also extremely hard (a nightmare for studying).


*Irritability* - This one is weird. I'm just irritable at random times every day. Even an old person walking slowly in front of me on road get me irritated.


*Weight loss* - I was 230 lbs./104 kg. at the start of 2015. By the end, I was 160-170 lbs. or 72-75 kg. This occurred the same time my other symptoms were worsening. The strange part of this I recall is that I put no major effort into losing weight - it simply happened by eating and acting the way I always did. Right now, I think there's some barrier that prevents me from gaining more weight. When I eat more than usual, my stomach is simply totally full and it can stay that way for days.


*Physical irritation* - My stomach feels tight and irritated all the time, and I can only defecate 1-2 times per week, sometimes not at all. When I do it's always painful and difficult, even when I make sure to eat fiber. Also, oddly the temple of my head feels weird and ""blocked"" all the time, like a stone. This is the same region that feels activated when you actually do feel emotions and pleasure, so I'm sure this is important.


*Sleep deprivation* - Any time I get stressed, I lose the ability to sleep altogether. Even small stressors, like college exams, usually cause this. My circadian rhythm also slips quite easily and I've ""inverted"" it by accident many times, waking up at dusk and sleeping at dawn. This never happened before the illness.


*Derealization* - Not to be confused with depersonalization. It's feeling totally removed from your environment. When out in public, I feel like a self-driving car with no driver at the wheel, my body is there but I'm not. 


**Attempted Treatments**

*Counseling* - I saw a church counselor as a teenager, but as you can imagine, it didn't help anything. He kept saying I was in a ""funk"" whereas I thought the problem must be physiological, and since talking about my (mostly nonexistent) emotions didn't do anything, I stopped going and swore off the idea of therapy.


*Antidepressants* - I've taken Sertraline, Bupropion, Nortriptyline, Tranylcypromine, and a host of others (5-6) that I regrettably didn't keep track of. I took all for 4+ weeks and yet none had -any- effects positive or negative save for the Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine (The NTP gave me dry mouth, the TCP gave me hypotension, but both oddly made me enjoy music more for a week before pooping out). Due to a limited budget and feeling like ADs were a waste of time for me, I've lost hope with them too.


*Supplements* - Lots of vitamins, a multi-vitamin, Betaine HCL, Sarcosine + NAC, NSI-189, Ashwagandha, probably forgetting some others. As you could have predicted, no effect.


*Meditation* - This is an odd one. When all my other emotions stopped working, I started meditating and was shocked that the ""calmness"" accompanying meditation still worked in me, and I thought there was some meaning in that. But a few months later I tried it again and that sensation was gone too, with no return. So I gave up.


*Exercise* - I took up jogging for a few weeks, it seemed to do absolutely nothing so I gave it up. 


*Diet* - I have tried eating healthier on and off but it didn't help. Also, certain healthy foods like chicken upset my stomach on occasion and I have no clue why. I often resort to junk food specifically because it feels like it won't upset my stomach. I visited a G.E. who had my bloodwork done but she said everything looked normal.


*Improving my life* - Tried making friends, going to college, getting a job, getting a car, getting a girlfriend. I did all of it. And still felt like crap. 


**Possible Origins**

*#1) Trauma* - When all this disease stuff started, I was 20. By the time it hit rock bottom, I was 22. During that timespan, I got physically attracted to our housemaid. And had resolved to confess my attraction to her and marry her due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had a mild panic like moment while watching an movie about forbidden love and it consequences. Sadly, the most likely explanation for the disease is that it's a latent problem that was triggered as a result of the stressor: The lasting damage is not due to the ""trauma"" though - it's not PTSD - it merely used the stress as a trigger.


*#2) Some weird stomach problem* - There's evidence for this as well. For one, most people in the Anhedonia subreddit never mention stomach problems (they largely get anhedonia from meds -- I never tried an antidepressant until the disease was severe), while stomach issues are a huge factor in my illness. Two, sometimes I'll eat a specific way and have a brief ""window"" where my sense of smell starts working again. For example, last Winter I quit sugar for a month and my sense of smell improved (and went back to baseline soon after). And a month or two ago, I had it again after eating some European chocolates from the store. But again, couldn't replicate it.


*#3) Something dopamine related* - I drink coffee obsessively, because it keeps me from being a complete zombie. 


**Conclusions**

Nothing really makes sense. The symptoms sorta align with depression, but from what I've seen depression doesn't have an onset of 3-4 years, it doesn't usually occur as one chronic never-ending ""episode"", and it doesn't respond to antidepressants as poorly as this. The whole path of the illness aligns more with schizophrenia to me, but I'm 24 and ~8 years after this began I've still seen zero positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia, or even schizoaffective disorder. There are no ups or downs like you see in most depression cases, nor feelings of guilt or worthlessness, nor suicidal ideation. So I'm really tempted to reject the depression idea. It feels like there's just some biological trigger I'm missing that's causing all this, but it's too obscure for me to grasp.


If you have any ideas or things that jump out at you, please let me know! This disease has stolen almost half my time on earth now, and will continue stealing more until it is solved. There are a lot of bright minds here, perhaps one of you can spot something. Thanks.",1,1765433617.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m sorry for no flair I honestly didn’t know what to put this under!

I have been at my job for almost two years now. It wasn’t the cleanest when I started but I thought I could “prove” myself and try to clean the whole place up for my boss. After a while I thought I was noticing mold on things. We have a rack for clothes products and on each handle I swore there was mold so I told my boss. She said oh no no that’s just dirt and she cleaned it off, whatever I moved on. My coworker and I decided to clean out our coffee cabinets next because they were cluttered and probably haven’t been cleaned in years. We removed everything and found so much mold on the back wall we both gasped. It was practically eating the wall and it almost looked melted if that makes sense. I’ve never seen mold so bad before. I told my boss again and she literally told me “oh yeah I know about that we’re gonna fix it eventually.” It’s been MONTHS since she told me that and I still remind her often. I found out her other business next door also has mold and she turns a blind eye to that too. I’m not sure what to do about this. I honestly think it’s making the employees sick. I used to be fine going in but now I go in and I get a massive headache by the end of the day, my nose burns when i’m on shift, I sneeze like crazy, and I feel so lazy I just want to sit and do nothing now. I notice everyone who works here ends up the same way after a few weeks or few months. Is there something I can legally do about this? Or should I just quit when I can?

1pjqbuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pjqbuu/aitah_for_missing_a_friend_group_that_almost_cost/,AITAH for missing a friend group that almost cost me my life?,"So my boyfriend and I had a big friend group for about 4 years for me and 10 years for him. 
The friend group was mainly surrounded by two brothers and their houses were the main hang out spot. 

Funny enough the two brother formed their own separate friend groups but it mainly consisted of one big friend group. 

So I use to be friends with one of the brothers and the other brothers wife. 

About a month ago I notice that somethings wrong with both of them, I message them and get no reply back. My anxiety levels were through the roof. 
I wait in anticipation that whole week and eventually get an answer that saturday. 

I get massive paragraphs from them both, basically saying I am a messed up person, I am playing both sides, I am manipulative and I should never contact them again. 

So the story goes, one weekend it was someones bachelors, our boyfriends were away so we decided to sleep by each other as we didnt want to be alone. 
The girl brings up the topic on how insecure she is around the boys in the friend group because her husbands brother keeps insulting her by saying her ass is small, the topic ventures into me and my boyfriend. She says that her husbands brother went to them and told them my boyfriend( his best friend) is not masculine enough for me and I could do better, and states that I will only be pretty if I gym, she also adds he said that he needs a big social battery for us, to which i then added he said that about them too (in a ahh whatever way) 
I let what she told me fly over my head l, as I understand friends say things they dont mean when theyre irritated or upset, but thinks differently the next day. 

She proceeds to get highly pissed off about the fact that he said that he needs a social battery for them, and proceeds to go on a rant on how shitty this guy is and tries to convince me (she did this in front of my mom) 

After the next few weeks she proceeds to constantly talk shit about him and tries to convince me not to be friends with him (multiple people witnessed how she spoke about him) and proceeds to say that she judges anyone that friends with him 

I start to get pissed off about it, because it was the only topic we spoke about whenever I saw her 

I decided I should go to the brother and own up to what I said, I tell him I told her about what he said about the social battery and that shes highly pissed off about it, and he tells me to keep my distance 

The next few weeks I got a really big ick in her, she spoke shit about her best friend and her husband (infront of my mom too) and once again was the only topic we spoke about 

Time goes by and one of our friends have a mutual bachelorette, I decided to take my boyfriends sister with.
It was at the brothers wifes house, and it was really just family and a few girls. 
Sometime into the night I realise my boyfriends sister is MIA, I look everywhere for her and find her in a bathroom sitting against a wall, on the verge of tears, with an older girl sitting on the toilet hanging over her. 
I lose my shit, its the first time we met this new girl, and I find out she kept asking my boyfriends sister sexual questions, they had a 10 year age gap and I felt highly uncomfortable.
Once i got my boyfriends sister out of the bathroom I vented to the brothers wife about it, and she looked indifferent. 

Later that night when everyone was going home, I heard how she went to the bachelorettes fiancé and said that I started drama, while im suppose to be her “best friend” 

I was highly pissed off about this and confided in the brother when we were alone one night, which i now realise was a big mistake, but I drew him a picture of what negativity does to my mind, and why i always choose to forgive to keep a positive mind, and he added that its a good characteristic to have and that its hard. 

Fast forward a few weeks, we were sitting on a bench and I asked the brother if his other brother was home, he said no and my boyfriend asked a double time and he still said no and kinda got pissed off, we leave it. 

The next day i go for coffee with the brothers wife, and she asks if we were by the brother and I say yes , she proceeds to lose her shit because apparently they made plans with him. 


That was the last time i saw them. 

I get a message saying that apparently the brother never told them that they werent home (he lied) and a voicenote cursing at me and practically telling me to kill myself from the brother wife. 

The brother lied and said i drew him a pictures of how much i hated the brothers wife (which was also a lie) 

The wife lied and said that i spoke shit abt her friends ( she lied with my mom as witness, my mom also witness her speaking shit about the brother) 

And they send me messages explaining how i am playing both sides and manipulative. 

I was going through a really hard time in life, and i had an attempt.
It was really ugly and i went to the hospital. 

My dad forced them to come and visit me, and they just stared at me, not even bothering to ask if im okay, which somehow made them coming worse. 

And now they’re proceeding to make the rest of the friendgroup up against me.
They also blocked me on everything before i could defend myself 

And somehow I still find myself grieving about them, what do I do?

It was the morning research grind. I’d wake up, open way too many tabs, jump between blogs, scroll Reddit and X, check competitor posts, skim new reports, try to spot anything trending. By the time I finished, I already felt like I had lived a full workday.

When I switched more stuff over to ChatGPT earlier this year, I really thought it would fix that. It did help with drafting, but without fresh info the tone kept drifting into that super generic AI voice. I kept having to rewrite everything because it just didn’t feel rooted in what was actually happening in the industry. So I was doing the same research anyway, just feeding it to the AI.

Two months ago I finally got sick of it and rebuilt everything around automation. Now every morning, before I even grab coffee, a workflow goes out and collects the good stuff. Industry blogs, Reddit threads in our niche, competitor posts, random spikes in search interest, new reports, all of it. It gets cleaned up and dropped into one tidy digest in Notion. I open one page instead of fifteen.

After that, the digest goes straight into ChatGPT through the API. Suddenly the ideas it gives me feel way more grounded. Still needs human review obviously, but I’m no longer fighting that floating out of context vibe. I usually tweak the tone, cut any weird lines, and that’s it. My morning routine now takes maybe twenty minutes instead of two hours.

After running this for a bit, engagement went up, follower growth picked up again, and weirdly enough, I actually like my mornings now. Turns out the biggest improvement wasn’t a fancy prompt.

As online shopping continues to grow, retailers are realizing that static images, no matter how beautiful or high resolution, cannot provide real context, scale or texture. Today’s customers expect certainty and traditional product photos cannot offer that level of clarity.

**For years**, e-commerce giants and boutique retailers alike have struggled to replicate the tactile confidence of in-store shopping. **Unfortunately**, we live in an era where consumers demand certainty. Static images—no matter how high-resolution or professionally lit—lack context. **Specifically**, they cannot show scale, they cannot show how light interacts with a fabric, **and** they certainly cannot prove that a sofa will fit through a doorway.

**This is where** AR-Ready 3D Models come in.

Augmented Reality (AR) product visualization is no longer a futuristic gimmick reserved for tech demos; **on the contrary**, it is rapidly becoming the standard for successful online retail. From visualizing a velvet sofa in a living room to checking the finish of a lamp on a bedside table, AR is reshaping consumer behavior.

**Below**, we explore why investing in high-quality AR 3D models is the most critical trend for e-commerce growth in 2025 and beyond.

# 1. How AR Ready 3D Models for Ecommerce Power the Try Before You Buy Experience

**Currently**, the biggest friction point in online shopping, especially for furniture and home decor, is the “imagination gap.” When a customer looks at a photo on a white background, they are forced to do mental gymnastics to imagine that object in their home.

**Fortunately**,[ AR-ready 3D](https://youtu.be/wP4_YcpCNWo) models bridge this gap by allowing users to place digital products directly into their physical environment using a smartphone camera. **Consequently**, this transforms a passive viewing experience into an active one.

* **The Psychological Shift:** **For instance**, when a user places an AR object in their room, a psychological phenomenon known as the “endowment effect” kicks in. By virtually placing the item in their personal space, they begin to feel a sense of ownership **before** they have even paid for it.
* **The Stat:** **In fact**, Shopify data suggests that products with AR capabilities see a **94% higher conversion rate** than those without.

# 2. Reducing Return Rates with High Quality AR 3D Product Models

**Moreover**, returns are the silent profit-killer of e-commerce. In the furniture industry alone, return rates can be staggering, with “item didn’t fit” or “looked different in person” being the top reasons.

**To combat this**, [high-fidelity 3D rendering](https://www.blueribbon3d.com/3d-modeling/) ensures that the digital twin of your product is photorealistic. When customers use AR to inspect a product from every angle and assess its size in their actual room, their expectations match reality.

* **Sustainability Impact:** **Additionally**, beyond just saving money on logistics and restocking fees, reducing returns is a massive sustainability win. Fewer returns mean fewer delivery trucks on the road and less packaging waste. **Since** modern consumers are increasingly eco-conscious, offering AR tools that prevent wasteful returns is a strong brand value proposition.
* **Trend Insight:** **As a result**, retailers implementing augmented reality product visualization have reported a reduction in return rates by up to **40%**.

# 3.WebAR and Low Poly AR Ready Models for Faster Ecommerce Experiences

**Historically**, in the early days of AR, brands required consumers to download clunky, dedicated apps to view products. **However**, this was a major barrier to entry; most users won’t download an app just to view a coffee table.

**The future is undoubtedly** WebAR (Web-based Augmented Reality).

**Now**, modern AR-ready models can be viewed directly through a mobile browser. A customer simply clicks a button on your product page, and the camera opens instantly. **Therefore**, this frictionless experience is crucial for keeping bounce rates low and engagement high.

* **Tech Tip:** **Nevertheless**, to achieve this, you need optimized low-poly 3D models that load instantly without sacrificing visual quality. This is a delicate balance that professional 3D modeling studios specialize in.

# 4. Enhancing Personalization with Interactive 3D Assets

**On the other hand**, static photography limits you to showing one or two variations of a product **because** photographing every color combination is expensive and time-consuming. **In contrast**, 3D models unlock the power of configurators.

With AR, shoppers can swap textures, change colors, and modify finishes in real-time. Whether it’s changing a chair from leather to fabric or testing a matte black finish versus gold, interactive 3D assets empower the customer to “build” their perfect product.

**Ultimately**, this interactivity keeps users on your website longer **and** significantly boosts the likelihood of a sale by allowing the customer to create a product that feels unique to them.

# 5. The Omnichannel Advantage of Photorealistic 3D Models

**Furthermore**, one of the hidden benefits of investing in AR-ready 3D models is their versatility. **Once** you have a high-quality 3D model of your product, it isn’t just for your website.

* **Social Media:** **First**, you can use these models to create Instagram or Snapchat filters, allowing users to interact with your products on social platforms.
* **Marketing Materials:** **Similarly**, the same 3D model used for AR can be used to render high-resolution photorealistic images for catalogs, banners, and ads, saving you the cost of physical photoshoots.
* **Video Content:** **Finally**, 3D assets can be animated for promotional videos without ever needing a physical prototype.

# 6. Why Quality Matters in AR Product Visualization

**As AR becomes more common, however**, customer standards are rising. A low-quality, cartoonish 3D model can actually *hurt* your brand perception. **For example**, if the fabric looks like plastic or the dimensions look off, the customer will assume the physical product is also low quality.

**Therefore**, to leverage this technology effectively, you don’t just need 3D models; you need **photorealistic assets**. The lighting, texture mapping, and geometry must be precise. **This is why** partnering with a specialized animation and rendering studio becomes essential.

# Conclusion: The Future of E-commerce is AR-Ready

**In conclusion**, the “future” of online shopping is already happening. As major players like IKEA and Amazon normalize AR shopping, consumers are beginning to *expect* it from every retailer.

**By 2025**, AR is no longer a “nice-to-have” feature—it is a competitive necessity. It builds trust, reduces costs, and creates a shopping experience that static photography simply cannot match.

**Ready to transform your product catalog?** At **Blue Ribbon 3D**, we specialize in creating photorealistic, AR-ready 3D assets that drive sales. From high-poly marketing renders to low-poly models for WebAR, we help you bring your products to life with precision and style.

1pjq968,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjq968,Trying out LUCKYCAT café in Lakeview East,"LUCKYCAT had a soft opening in September this year in the Lakeview East neighborhood, but I checked it out recently. They source speciality coffee from China and roast it locally in Chicago, but they also have a limited food menu too.

Braised Chicken + Rice Bowl: The menu description said that it had spicy pickled lotus root, but the lotus root wasn’t spicy at all. The chicken and purple rice ratio was good. The chicken was flavorful although just a tad bit too salty for me. However, the purple rice balanced it out nicely.

Breakfast Sandwich: It was a little on the dry side and the flavor of the Gruyère didn’t come through as much as we thought it would, so adding the thick cut bacon option would elevate the sandwich.

Black Sesame Chia Pudding: It had nice mix of creamy, chewy, and crunchy textures and was an overall light snack. I wish the black sesame flavor was bolder as I think it got a little lost in the coconut milk flavor. 

Black Sesame Latte: This wasn’t overly sweet and had an earthy, nutty note. The black sesame flavor was light in this also. However, it was nice to drink this warm latte on a cold day.

Some of their other menu items sounded good, so I probably will go back sometime in the future to try some of their other drinks!",5,1765433309.0,chicagofood,0,1.0,False

1pjq7ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pjq7ra/i_started_a_government_job_in_a_mine_and/,"I Started a Government Job in a Mine, and Something’s Not Right [Part 3]","**As familiar as breathing, as normal as walking.**  
 We’ve had this sense of normalcy for a month and a half—waking up every morning, going to the mine run, coming back home just in time for lunch with our families.

This morning started off differently. The normalcy shifted. Benny is on leave.  
 His girlfriend is due any time now, and this job’s quirks kept getting better—offering **paternity** leave, and paid at that.

The money has been good. Our modest home finally got the needed changes we’d been putting off, and our struggle to make ends meet just… stopped after our first check. My wife can actually get her medication. This is also the day my father died.  
 He passed from liver cancer three years ago. Due to his tendency toward poisoning himself, it reminds me not to take what I have for granted. And that nothing is certain.

With that reminder rattling around in my head, I burned my hand pouring coffee. I yipped like a dog being stepped on, and my wife—already awake making breakfast—came to comfort me.

If anyone knew how childlike and vulnerable my wife makes me, I’d feel embarrassed. But in moments like this, I never cared. I just accepted the comfort.

I didn’t want to go into work this morning—not sick, not upset—but a bad feeling gnawed at me, like the one sea captains get when the water is calm but dark clouds hide on the horizon. I see no clouds. It’s just my gut.



I finished breakfast and was heading out the door when Maggie stopped me, her hand closing gently around my arm. If she’d asked me to stay home, I would’ve—no hesitation.

She glanced toward the car.  
 “I went to the store yesterday and got you and the guys something. You always say how dark it gets down there.”

She walked with me to the trunk and popped it open. Four boxes sat inside. I picked one up, reading the label.

“Road flares—just in case the power goes out,” she said. “And… just don’t get lost. I love you, hun.”

  
The gut feeling was still there. At least I wouldn’t be blind to it in the dark.

First day in the mine locker room without Benny’s dumb jokes—just silence.

Sam actually tried to make conversation today, which surprised me. It might’ve been to fill the void Benny left behind.

“Alan, so why do you have to take over for Benny and the clipboard? Like, I’m just asking ‘cause it’s not like we can’t help out too. Shieet, man, I see weird shit in the mine sometimes. I can jot stuff down if it helps.”

Honestly, I never questioned why I was given more responsibility and why it wasn’t shared among us. But Sam was absolutely right.

“I’m not sure. Dr. Malcolm told me yesterday, so maybe it’s protocol?”

Mike spoke into the small silence, almost cutting off my last word.

“Because you’re last in. Might see something behind us we don’t.”

Chills. Mike is a man of few words, and in those few words, he chose to be a dick today.

Sam shook his head.  
 “Yeah… great. Now I’m gonna look behind me the whole fucking way in today. Thanks, Mike.”

“We have a job to do. Stop getting scared,” Mike said, then immediately walked out of the locker room. He’d been acting out of character all morning—extra short, extra tense.

“Hey Alan, do you know what’s up with Mike?”

“I have no idea. Maybe issues at home? Hey man—sorry to ask, but can you fit some of my stuff in your locker too? My wife bought us all road flares just in case, but these boxes hardly fit.”

“You know what? Why don’t I help you carry them to the cart? We can put them in the equipment shed.”

“Awesome idea. Let’s do it.”

Sam and I tethered up and walked out. Mike was already by the cart, tethered to the mine line, silent and rigid. We loaded the flares into the back.

“Mike, you gotta tether to us too, man. C’mon,” Sam said.  
 Sam wasn’t afraid to talk to Mike. I, on the other hand, felt a creeping unease. His demeanor reminded me too much of my father after his binges—short, angry, quiet… until something bothered him. Then came the glass shattering. The worst was when he twisted my arm so badly my radius splintered. ER visit. I was eleven.

And now, at twenty-eight, I felt that same old fear crawling up my spine—just from Mike’s tone.

Like an adult, I ignored it, did my job, and tried to forget the feeling. Maybe this day was hitting me harder because it was my father’s death anniversary. Maybe my brain knew before I did.

Just as we placed ourselves on the cart and started moving, I opened the newly assigned clipboard. Benny had written on the top page:

*Can’t wait to see you guys as a new dad! — Benny*

A smile crept across my face, easing something tight in my chest.

Why does something so easy always get complicated? Like this job: go in, press a button, get out. Why all the nuance? I never questioned any of it until Malcolm told me specifically to look for abnormalities, write them down, and turn them in. 

Never noticed how quiet it really is down there.  
 Deafening.  
 And before we even reached the elevator platform, I felt the pressure change—like fingers stuffing my ears.  
  
Suddenly, the Cart came to a slow stop, which wasn’t due to the brakes; the Cart died.   
  
“What the hell didn’t we charge this before leaving ?” Sam asks while Mike gets out to kick the cart.  
“Piece of junk, guess we are walking to the Elevator then.” Mike was already leaving without us, so I quickly got out and followed Sam and Mike.   
Myself in the back, I had to jog to keep up.   
  
The pressure stopped, I swore I heard something, …I thought it was Benny, maybe in pain — but that made no sense. He wasn’t here. 

After just 10 more minutes, the pressure came back.

I couldn’t hear my own breathing. Everything sounded muffled.

My headlamp flickered. Then Sam’s.  
 Then Mike’s.

And with Mike’s, he misstepped and fell hard onto the rock. Sam and I rushed to him. Looked like he just lost his footing when the lights blinked. His ankle looked fine—no swelling.

But…

The suit was torn at the knee. And his actual knee was bleeding a bright, horrifying crimson against the yellow fabric. It was impossible to miss. Panic-inducing.

“Holy shit, Mike—YOUR SUIT. We need to get you back. You’ve been exposed. We need to press the latch!”

“NO. I AM FINE. I am IN CHARGE. We CONTINUE.”

“Listen, Mike—Alan’s trying to do the right thing. You need to too. We weren’t told what we could get exposed to here. We need to take this seriously and use the latch.”

Mike stood, latch in hand.

“We use this if one of us drops dead or is lost—*not* because someone scraped a knee. We finish the route.”



Mike’s slack keeps increasing—more and more—and soon it’s just a trembling line and a small shadow ahead of Sam. I’m right behind him, but it feels like I’m walking and breathing underwater. Every step is weighted. My chest feels tight.  
 Something is wrong. Deeply, horribly wrong.

I press the comm, almost scared to even hear whatever comes back.

**“Mike… you really sure you’re okay to keep going?”**

His voice crackles through, calm but clipped:  
 **“I’m fine. Let’s keep moving. Focus on your roles.”**

Sam hits his button immediately after me, his voice coming out like a hiss:  
 **“I don’t think you understand, man. You’re bleeding inside the suit. That’s exposure. We need to stop, patch it, reassess—”**

Mike cuts him off:  
 **“I heard you. Do what you want, but I’m continuing.”**

A pit opens in my stomach. I try to push back, even though my voice shakes.

**“This isn’t just about protocol, Mike. This is about your safety—and ours. If anything goes wrong…”**

Sam interrupts, urgent and louder:  
 **“I don’t care about protocol! This isn’t normal, and we shouldn’t just walk forward like it is. Something’s… wrong with this mine.”**

There’s a long, buzzing pause over the comm.  
 Mike doesn’t yell. He doesn’t sigh. He doesn’t even sound annoyed.

He just says:  
 **“Then either keep up… or turn back. Your choice.”**

The words hang in the darkness, echoing through my helmet. Nothing after that. Not a shuffle. Not a breath. Just the low, eerie hum of the mine creeping into every corner of my mind.

Without realizing it, I tighten my grip on the clipboard. My hand is shaking as I write:

*Mike tore his suit and ignored protocol.*



Without a care for us, and the pressure building in my ears, I was worried about my suit.   
  
  


Gloves and boots, tight and sure, four wraps make the suit secure.   
The three of us, now feeling like 2, I just see myself and Sam, we finally see the elevator, and Mike has been sitting there waiting on us.   
  
“Was worried you two left. Let's get this run done, I got shit to do today.”



We entered the elevator in silence.  
 Barely felt anything on the walk to the terminal.  
 We got there, and without even glancing at us, Mike pressed the button and started back past me and Sam.

The mine shook. **DING.**  
 The lights flickered. **DING.**  
 All the power snapped off—everything but a single blinking red dot on the terminal.

It was pitch black.

I pressed my comms to speak—nothing. No static. No click. Like pressing into dead fabric.

**THRAAANG.**

A deafening metallic blast.  
 Instinct kicked in—I grabbed my helmet on both sides, trying to cover my ears through it. No sound now. Just ringing. Violent, nauseating ringing.

The lights surged back on, but wrong. Too bright.  
 Too white.  
 Getting brighter and brighter—my headlamp felt like it was daylight inside my visor.

Then—silence.  
 Lights back to normal.

The only thing I could hear was the ringing in my skull.  
 I looked at Sam—just as disoriented, pushing himself off his knees.

Mike was lying on the ground. Unmoving.

“MIKE! YOU OK!?”

I shouted without even remembering I had to press my comms. Didn’t matter—I was already rushing to him.

He was breathing. But **bleeding from the ears**.

Adrenaline surged through me. **We had to get out. Now.**

I grabbed Mike under the arms and dragged him toward the elevator. Sam stumbled upright, then broke into a jog, taking Mike’s other side. Together, we hauled him between us.

We didn’t hesitate once all three of us were in.  
 I yanked the clamp on the emergency latch and slammed the button.

The tether snapped tight and **ripped us backward—hard. Fast. Violent.**

We clung to Mike so he wouldn’t swing into the walls. My only thought was holding on tight enough to keep him alive.

Our boots scraped against the rock, barely keeping up as the emergency reel hauled us backward through the dark like a hooked fish.

The tunnel lights stuttered as we passed them—**white–black–white**—sharp, disorienting bursts. Every flicker made the shadows jump, stretch, twist into shapes that didn’t belong to the walls.

Mike sagged between us, heavy and limp.  
 Every few steps the line jerked hard, and his body swung dangerously—his helmet nearly clipping the rock. Sam grabbed the tether above Mike’s chest to steady him, grunting from the force.

The ringing in my ears made it impossible to tell if I was breathing loudly or not at all. Everything felt muffled, underwater, wrong.

A low vibration hummed up through the floor.

We whipped around a turn, our shoulders slamming into the wall. I bit my tongue. Tasted blood.  
 Sam must have yelled—**all I heard was a muffled scream, swallowed by the thick, choking quiet.**

Air shouldn’t move this far down, but a cold draft hit us—sharp enough to sting through the fabric of my suit. It slid over my ribs like someone brushing past me in the dark.

I didn’t look back.  
 I couldn’t.

The tether tightened again, hauling us up a slight incline. My calves burned from trying to keep balance while holding Mike’s arm over my shoulder. His head lolled forward, then back, like he was drifting in and out of consciousness or… something worse.

And then—right when my limbs were ready to give out—



**The mine spat us out.**

**Like it had been trying to consume us—and finally decided we weren’t worth keeping.**

**Like we were something foul it wanted gone.**

This isn't laziness. This is 10,000 years of evolution optimizing for energy conservation.
When you think about doing something hard, your brain releases cortisol and activates your amygdala (threat response). When you think about doing something easy, it releases dopamine (reward response).
The result? You procrastinate on important work and binge easy dopamine (scrolling, gaming, consumption).
I spent 90 days using neuroscience protocols to rewire this response. Now my brain craves difficulty instead of avoiding it.
The four protocols I used:
1. Dopamine Delay Training
Pair hard tasks with immediate pre-task dopamine hits. Coffee before deep work. One favorite song before training. Your brain starts associating the hard task with the dopamine ritual.
After 30 days, your brain releases dopamine in anticipation of the hard task. After 60 days, the task itself becomes the dopamine source. This is classical conditioning (Pavlov) applied to your own neurology.
2. Effort Reframing Through Language
Change ""I HAVE to train"" to ""I GET to train."" This isn't positive thinking bullshit. Stanford research showed that hotel cleaners who reframed their work as exercise lost weight and improved health markers without changing behavior.
Your brain interprets effort based on the language you use. Change the narrative, change the neural response.
3. Minimum Viable Effort Ladder
Start with tasks so easy your brain can't resist. Want to love reading? Start with one page. Want to love training? Start with one pushup.
Your brain stops activating threat response because effort is minimal. Then you incrementally increase. This is graduated exposure therapy for effort avoidance.
Duke University research shows this creates neuroplasticity without triggering avoidance. Your brain adapts to slightly harder tasks without the stress response.
4. Immediate Evidence Collection
Track every hard task completed. Not for motivation. For evidence-based belief building.
After 30 days, you have 30 pieces of proof that you do hard things. Your brain can't argue with data. Your identity shifts from ""I avoid difficulty"" to ""I do hard things consistently.""
The biological changes after 90 days:
Anterior cingulate cortex stops signaling threat during effort
Dopamine baseline increases (you need less external stimulation)
Endorphins release DURING hard tasks instead of after (runner's high for all effort)
Basal ganglia installs new automatic program (hard task → confidence → execution)
fMRI scans show that people who consistently do hard things show reduced amygdala activation when facing challenges. Your brain physically changes.
The identity shift:
You stop being someone who forces themselves to do hard things. You become someone who seeks hard things.
This isn't David Goggins-level suffering addiction (though he operates on the same principles). This is making your default state crave challenge instead of comfort.
The science is proven. Neuroplasticity is real. Your brain changes based on consistent behavioral patterns.
University College London research shows habit formation takes 66 days, but identity formation takes 90 days of consistent behavior before your self-concept fully shifts.

Hi everyone,

I’m a 27-year-old newly married woman from the Gulf, and I’m really struggling with what direction to take in my life.

I currently work in a corporate role that demands a lot of time and energy. It puts me under so much stress, and lately I’ve been feeling like I genuinely hate working. I hate waking up early, coming home exhausted, and feeling like I have to squeeze my personal, social, and family life into whatever time I have left. I don’t have kids yet, but I’m seriously considering leaving my job and becoming a stay-at-home wife, and eventually a stay-at-home mom, God willing.

No woman on my side of the family has ever chosen the SAHM/SAHW path, but several women on my husband’s side have. I don’t feel comfortable talking about this openly with his family because they can be a bit judgmental. When I talk to my own family, they mainly warn me about the downsides like financial dependency, even if the husband is a good man, how exhausting childcare can be, and how difficult it might be for me to adjust after being used to earning my own income.

And honestly, the financial part is real. I currently make around $2,700/month. If I stay home, my husband can give me about $800/month. We live in a very expensive country. For example, attending a wedding easily costs $200+ for a dress and $80 for hair, just to meet social expectations. If someone gets married or has given birth the expected gift can be no less than a 100$, even a cup of good coffee is almost 10$. All in all, our lifestyle and daily expenses are very expensive. 

But even knowing all that, I still feel drawn toward staying home. I want to be present for my future children. I want to raise them myself. My current job offers almost no flexibility: limited maternity leave, no remote work, and no leave for childcare emergencies. Everything is so rigid, and I’m scared that if I continue on this path, I won’t have the kind of motherhood experience I’ve always dreamed of.

I’m not looking for validation one way or another.  I genuinely want honest advice and real-life experiences from women who have chosen either path.

If you became a stay-at-home wife or mom, are you happy? What were the hardest parts, and what do you wish you knew before deciding?

If you stayed in the workforce, do you ever regret it? How do you balance work with family life?

Any personal stories or perspectives would mean a lot.

* Automating investments FIRST, not saving ""what's left"" - gained ₹1.8L in portfolio value
* The ₹200 daily coffee I stopped judging myself for - it's my only ""me time"" before work

**Made me poorer (or just didn't matter):**

* The gym membership I ""needed"" but used 4 times in 6 months - ₹18k wasted
* Impulse buys under ₹500 that I convinced myself ""don't count"" - added up to ₹2.1L
* Trying to optimize every single expense - the mental exhaustion wasn't worth the ₹3k saved

**The Reality Check:** My salary isn't the problem. Most of us earn enough. The problem was I wasn't *directing* my money - it was just... disappearing. Now I invest 24% of my income AND spend guilt-free on things that actually matter to me.

**Current state:** 6 months in, ₹1.8L invested, ₹50k in experiences I still smile about, zero lifestyle inflation guilt.

1pjq1om,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1pjq1om/i_spent_way_too_long_researching_how_airwallex/,I spent way too long researching how Airwallex went from a coffee side-hustle to an $8B fintech beast (just raised $330M). Here’s what I learned...,"I’ve been obsessed with these insane fintech growth stories lately and Airwallex absolutely blew my mind. These guys started in a tiny Melbourne office in 2015 because they were sick of getting destroyed by bank fees while importing coffee equipment for their cafe. Fast forward to last week and they just closed a $330M round at an $8B valuation, with a second HQ in San Francisco and plans for a 2026 IPO. That’s up from $6.2B only a few months ago.  
  
The wildest part? Back in 2018 when they were doing maybe $2M in revenue, Stripe offered $1.2B to buy them. The five founders took a vote over WhatsApp and said no (yes over whatsapp). That decision alone has 7x’d since then.  
  
I went down the rabbit hole and pieced together the whole story from their blog posts, investor updates, Contrary Research, The Generalist, AFR articles, etc. No insider stuff, just public info. Here’s the quick version:  
  
It all started because Jack Zhang (CEO) and the team were running a little cafe called Tukk & Co and kept losing their margins to terrible FX rates, slow transfers, and hidden fees. Jack had already made decent money flipping real estate and trading algo stuff, so he recruited his uni friends Lucy Liu (ex-investment banking), Jacob Dai (CTO), and a couple others, threw in their own cash (Lucy put in a full million), and started building.  
Early idea was some P2P currency swap thing but it flopped hard. They pivoted fast to B2B cross-border infrastructure and never looked back. Perfect timing too: e-commerce exploding, remote teams everywhere, everyone suddenly needed to pay suppliers and contractors across borders without getting robbed.  
  
Today they’ve got 150,000+ customers (Canva, Deel, McLaren, etc), process $235B in payments a year (73% growth), just crossed $1B ARR with 90% growth, and they’re cash-flow positive. They built their own payment rails so 95% of payouts land same-day, they issue Visa cards everywhere, do treasury, yield on idle cash, embedded finance APIs, the whole package. Free to start, make money on the markup and cards. Super sticky once companies add the cards and expenses.  
  
They’ve been on a land-grab spree: 80+ payment licenses, offices all over, just bought a company to enter Mexico and Brazil, and now they’re going hard on the US because awareness is still low there even though revenue is growing 300-400% in the Americas.  
  
Culture seems intense (Jack apparently coded 20-hour days in the beginning and they had some burnout issues in 2023), but they fixed engagement scores and keep hiring like crazy (1700+ people now).  
  
**Takeaways that actually hit me:**  
  
\- Saying no to a life-changing acquisition when everyone thinks you’re nuts can pay off huge if you truly believe in the vision  
\- Owning the infrastructure instead of reselling someone else’s gives you real margins and speed  
\- Start in one strong region (APAC for them) then use the cash flow to attack everywhere else  
\- Bundling a bunch of “free” products that all feed each other is brutal for retention  
\- Real founder-market fit matters: they lived the exact pain they’re solving  
  
Anyway, that’s the story that’s been living rent-free in my head all week.   
Anyone else building in fintech or payments? Was turning down Stripe genius or reckless? Would love to hear your takes.

But if you overshot it rather than overthink it, you would get what you want 99.99999 percent of the time. Human error will always be a factor of some value, its pointless to pretend that its not. Everybody will always have a fuckup or 2, but if you just let it go, those fuckups will be 1 in a million good ones and not even worth it.
If you want something done, visualize it already done. If you wanna finish a race, don't visualize yourself literally crossing the finish line, visualize yourself afterwards with a cup of water, changing your shoes, sitting in the car or the lounge after or whatever with the relief you know you'd feel after the race. Overshoot it.
If you want a free coffee, don't visualize the exchange of said coffee. You're holding said coffee in your hand, feeling the warmpth thinking oh wow, I'm so glad I have coffee and it was free! Nice. Overshoot it. Even if its not free, visualize having a coffee if you need one bad enough, (like I often do) and 9 times out of 10 no matter how tired you are you'll suddenly find you've made said coffee and are happily sipping it. Get the idea?
If security is slow at the airport and you're worried about missing your flight, don't imagine walking through security at the front of the line. Imagine sitting on the plane with your headphones on. Won't be worried when you're on the plane, right? Overshoot it.
A vocal tip I once picked up is to sing a really high note, don't reach for it. Aim for a higher note, a good 2 or so semitones away being an example, but whatever. The point is that you should aim for something a bit beyond the point of desire. If you were to jump over a fence, you wouldn't focus on the top of the fence, or you'll worry about hitting it. You'd focus on a spot just over it, and jump for that. Therefore you put more power in than you need to, clearing the fence. Or.... Overshooting it. See? Maybe don't actually try that one, though.
In short, the manifestation should be completed in your mind, all the work should be done. How its done, any point of that process, is not your business. And actually achieving the thing is not your business. Focus on whats happening after you have it. That is the shortest, and easiest way to relax you enough to make it happen. Theres always so much bs on manifestation subs about the how, what methods, getting signs that your manifestations are working, the only sign is you fuckin doing it. Hopefully this'll help some of you relieve some blockage surrounding this art.
You will fuck up. I did say that earlier and it is true. I still do. Thats why you start small. Coffee, (as per example), getting a meeting canceled, having a certain food you crave but don't have often, etc. Lots of people jump to cars and houses and sps (god I hate that term) but you're focusing on the achievement itself, and not after having it. Remember, you don't want to experience getting something, you want to experience having it. And if you fuck up, and you will, keep going and do it again. Don't overanalyze, don't tell yourself your bad at it, you're not. Theres no teachers to give you a bad grade. The only judge is yourself. But things happen very quickly if you use this method, which is the only method you ever need imo. Scripting, staring into a mirror, whatever else, its fun to get your mind working, but its too much, all filler. Focus on whats within if you want without.
Don't get worked up either. That'll increase the fuckup meter. But if you think of already having said thing, theres no reason to work yourself up, as its already in your hands, right? How it got there is only a memory.

1pjpwjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/my_life_story/comments/1pjpwjx/the_quiet_man_9/,The Quiet Man (9),"As I mentioned before, telling my life story is a cry for help for me, a way to escape my helpless silence, the regrets that have settled in my mind, and the mistakes I constantly think about. Thank you for hearing my cry and reading my writings.

I had made a few friends at school; we played basketball together and spent time together during every break. One day, as we passed by the young man who was the school security guard, we heard him talking to someone on the phone in the security booth. We heard him say to the person on the phone, ""Man, you should see the teachers and women here, they're so sexy, especially the female students, they'll blow your mind."" I told my friends, ""I'm going to try to talk to this guy, get close to him and gather some information."" They agreed. I would occasionally bring the security guard tea and have short chats with him. One day I brought him tea again. He thanked me and took the tea. I went to the hut and he asked me, ""Who's your favorite teacher, buddy?"" I replied, ""Our philosophy teacher is very warm towards me, she's a very beautiful woman."" ""Red-haired?"" he asked. His slack lips gave him away. ""Yes,"" I said. ""She's really sexy,"" he said. He didn't know I was recording him. I asked him about the assistant principal. He laughed and said they had really ruined her, that her hips were completely messed up. The conversation slowly took on a sexual tone. I collected this kind of evidence for about a week. Finally, I brought it up with a teacher I trusted. I played him the recordings. And they fired him. As the security guard left, he said, ""I trusted you."" He blamed me for him losing his job. Again, I said nothing.

Over time, I was labeled a snitch. No one thanked me for stopping a potential predator. I didn't care. I continued hanging out with my own group of friends.

One day, at my friends' insistence, I participated in the school basketball team tryouts. Everyone who participated in the tryouts played against each other in teams, and the winning team earned the right to join the basketball team. I wanted to try my luck. 
Our PE teacher was a man; I didn't know his son was at our school. I didn't even know he had a son. I played in the first elimination game, and the referee was the PE teacher. The PE teacher's son was on the opposing team. He was a skinny, tall kid. I was heavier and the same height as him. When the game started, I tried to show everything I could do with all my strength. When I got the ball, I ran and tried to score, but this kid deliberately bumped into me and fell down, then looked at his dad while on the ground. His dad called a foul. The same thing happened twice. It was clear that the kid saw me as a rival and was trying to eliminate me. The third time I tried to layup, I started running slower, and he again stepped in front of me and tried to bump me, but I spun the ball and passed him without touching him. But he lost his balance and threw himself to the ground again. His father blew the whistle again. I yelled at the referee. ""This is favoritism. Who is this kid that you're always on his side?"" I said. ""You're constantly fouling my son,"" he said, and then I understood. My friends next to me also said several times that I hadn't touched his son, that he had deliberately thrown himself to the ground, but he didn't listen and took me out of the game.

After the game, I went over to him. He addressed me by my last name. ""Come here,"" he said, saying my last name. ""Why did you do that?"" I asked. ""I didn't do anything, but I got angry when I saw my son on the ground."" (I thought to myself, ""What kind of fathers are there like this?"") Then he said he knew my last name well. He said he knew my father's brothers and had apologized to them. I was surprised. They were afraid of my father and my father's family. But I didn't know anyone else but my father. I left his room without saying anything.

I started researching my own family. I told the registry office it was for a school assignment. I wrote petitions requesting a family tree be drawn up, and I also sent a petition to Kars requesting detailed historical information about the family.

I learned that my father's lineage was very deep-rooted. The records went back to the 1400s and 1700s. Our great-grandfather had settled his own community while living as a nomad in a place close to present-day Azerbaijan, near Turkey. Later, due to certain events, they gradually moved to the village of Susuz in present-day Kars. They settled there, multiplied, and have lived there ever since. My uncles, cousins, and aunts were dangerous people. Since I knew no one but my father, I knew nothing about them. 

Learning this information did me no good; after all, my father was nowhere to be found. I hadn't seen him in a very long time. Sometimes I wanted to see him, but he didn't want to see me. If he wanted to see me, he would have called and asked about me; he would have found a way to reach me, I tell myself. 

One day I left school and went home. At home, I saw my stepbrother and his wife. My stepbrother was a soldier in the armed forces. He said he had been transferred and would be leaving his wife with us for a few days, as he needed to pack up the house to move to the barracks. A few days after my stepbrother left to take care of his affairs, we woke up one morning to the door being banged loudly. I rushed to open the door. It was our downstairs neighbor. ""What's going on here?"" he asked. ""What's going on?"" I said. ""A woman on your balcony is yelling at people walking down the street. Don't you realize?"" he said. Since the house was on the main street, we often didn't pay attention to the noise. Hearing us talking to the neighbor, my mother and stepfather immediately ran to the balcony. I slammed the door in the neighbor's face and followed them right away. My stepbrother's wife had come out onto the balcony and was shouting. ""Neighbors, my brothers, help me,"" she was saying. My stepfather pulled her inside and asked, ""What's going on?"" My stepbrother's wife said, ""You're suffocating me,"" and fainted. We took her to the hospital immediately. The doctor examined her, said she had a psychological problem, and referred her to a renowned psychiatrist. That doctor said it was the onset of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He prescribed medication, but she refused to take it, saying, ""I'm not crazy."" 

A few days later, my stepbrother's mother came to visit us. They discussed the situation together and looked for ways to get her to take the medication. 

It was Friday. My stepbrother had finished work and come home. My stepfather wanted us all to go to Friday prayers together, so we started getting ready. Before leaving the house, my stepbrother's mother-in-law served us all a cup of coffee. We men quickly drank our coffee and went to pray. However, while the imam was giving his sermon in the mosque, I felt a heaviness on me. My head was spinning, and I started to feel sleepy. Somehow, I managed to start the prayer. But when I knelt down, I couldn't get up. After the prayer was over, my stepfather and stepbrother came and lifted me up. They took me home. As soon as I entered the house, I wanted to go to my room and sleep. I couldn't open my eyes, but I couldn't sleep either. Then my mother came. She explained what had happened: my stepbrother's mother-in-law had put the medicine in the coffee because her daughter hadn't taken it, and when the cups got mixed up, the coffee with the medicine in it had come to me. That's why I was in that state. Even though they didn't know what the effects of that strong medicine would be, they didn't care enough to take me to the hospital. In fact, my mother said, ""Just rest, it will pass."" 

Seeing that I was still worthless in my mother's eyes was really wearing me down...",1,1765432079.0,my_life_story,0,1.0,False

growth and identity.
what do you think?

In short, the identity update described in this essay is not “adding knowledge” but “re-designing selection standards.”

The most substantive transformation of identity lies in deciding what stays in the OS, what must be blocked, and what should no longer remain part of one’s worldview.

Where, then, do these standards come from?
Daily life offers simple clues.

Imagine that a messaging app update removes a function you use frequently.

You simply would not update, because the current version fits your purpose better.

Yet most people, unaware of where their assumptions originate, hit the update button believing vaguely that “updates = faster and better.”

They then struggle to find the function, realize it has vanished, and regret it.

This difference is structural thinking.

The ability to understand what is updated quickly, why something feels optimized, what possibilities open or close, and where that judgment originated.

If you do not recognize that the amount of information you must handle has increased, the structure of your choices will inevitably waver.

Structural thinking is not “because it looks good” or “because everyone else does it,”
but the ability to examine the direction of updates based on “my purpose, my resources, and the state of my OS.”

Without this ability, identity updates are pushed along by others' standards and the speed of the environment.

Turning the perspective inward, this becomes the process of inspecting one’s own OS.

What habits do I have?

Where did those habits begin?

What standards inform my current judgments, and from what experiences did they arise?

Why did I make this choice?

Why did I react this way?

Why did I feel optimized at that moment, and what was the origin of that feeling?

Which possibilities were opening, and which were closing?

Did my judgment originate from facts, or from familiarity and fear?

How much information am I handling at this moment, and was my OS prepared for that volume?

These questions reveal where my system began and the standards on which it now operates.

And these questions naturally dismantle the sentence “this is just who I am.”

Following the answers, one discovers that what one believed to be “innate” was simply an OS version formed within a certain time, environment, and set of relationships.

Identity begins to move only when one recognizes that the version is not absolute and can be re-edited, reduced, or redesigned when necessary.

Even a simple daily action like “drinking coffee” changes completely depending on perspective.

Some drink it because others do, some out of habit, some to feel “awake.”

But someone else notices not the feeling but the sensation of awakening.

This difference matters.
The moment one captures the sensation, coffee reveals a structure.

Within the structure of sensation, habits, moods, actions, and needs are interconnected.

Once this structure appears, coffee is reinterpreted as a condition for productivity, a shift in rhythm, or the starting point of focus.

And this meaning generates further perspectives.

Understanding the mechanism of “awakening” naturally extends that insight into other areas.

Let us shift the perspective back to myself.

Take the habit of biting fingernails.
What is its origin?

To relieve tension.

Why this action whenever tension arises?

Because the sensation disperses attention and induces immersion.

How was it learned?

By unconsciously copying a friend—curiosity turning into imitation, and imitation into habit.

But what matters is not merely explaining the phenomenon,
but recognizing the deeper structure: “I have a strong instinct for imitation.”

Why?

Because humans are born to learn through imitation.

With that recognition, one stops blaming oneself and instead understands one’s system.

Understanding reveals choices, and choices enable action.

As perspective expands, one realizes that habits cover a wide domain,
and this leads to reevaluating decisions and behaviors more generally.

This understanding eventually extends to collective customs as well.

Even the smallest daily experience faithfully reveals how the OS operates.

Identity expands not by stacking apps, but by recognizing how one’s OS functions.

**Jeongdok Public Library (close to Bukchon and Insadong):** many places for a small break!

**National Library of Korea (close to Seocho):** many research materials available

##🤍**Studying Etiquettes in Korea**

**Quietness ..🤫**
You should use **earphones or headset** for sounds! If you have a laptop, make sure the keyboard noises are low (or use a keyboard cover) and if you have a mouse, make sure it’s not too noisy.

Saving seats: **personal items = reservation**
In Korea, putting personal items somewhere means, ‘This spot is occupied.’ Koreans normally don’t steal others’ belongings, so if you want to save your seat, put your personal items on it! But don’t leave the seats unattended for too long…

**Charging Etiquettes**
Charging is very important in studying and actually, many people compete to get the ‘charging nearby seat’. If you’re far away from the charging spot, don’t stretch the cables to charge, but just wait until the nearby seat is available.

##📲**Studying App Recommendation that Korean Students Use**

📑**Focus & Time management**
**1. Forest**
This app increases your focus, the **tree grows when you focus longer hours!**

**2. Yeolpumta**
This is study time recording app, there are diverse group rooms (university, study groups, etc) where you can study with your peers and exchange information

📗**Notes/Organization**
**1. Goodnotes**
Basic note app that most Korean university students use to organize their lecture notes!

**2. Notion**
It might be hard to use for beginners, but it is a great app to organize the scattered notes and documents!

✏️**Studying & Knowledge**
**1. Everytime**
This is where all of the information of the university is located and shared. If you want to get some information about your exam… check it out!

**2. Kakaotalk Openchat**
Openchat is where you can gather with other people and share information. If you need some help when studying, reach for help! There are many rooms for foreigners too :)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Red Wings vs. Edmonton Oilers: A Battle of Brains, Brawn, and McDavid’s Late-Night Coffee Habit**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s equal parts chess match and circus act. The Detroit Red Wings, fresh off a six-game road trip and still riding high from their shutout of the Vancouver Canucks, face off against the Edmonton Oilers—a team that’s part superhero, part sleep-deprived student trying to pull off an all-nighter. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a locker-room joke.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The numbers scream **Edmonton as the clear favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.50** (implied probability: \~66%). Detroit’s odds sit at **2.60-2.70** (\~37-38%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Yeah, the Oilers are gonna win, but if you *really* want to bet on the Red Wings, go ahead—we’ll let you.” The spread favors Edmonton by 1.5 goals, and the total line is 6.5, suggesting a low-scoring, defensive grudge match.

But here’s the twist: Detroit’s **5-game point streak** includes a shutout and a shootout win, proving they’re the NHL’s version of a “slow start, nuclear finish” car in a drag race. Meanwhile, Edmonton’s **1-2 record in their last three games** (including that heart-stopping OT loss to Buffalo) feels like a team playing with one hand tied behind their back… or a goalie who’s still half-asleep.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and McDavid’s Midlife Crisis

Let’s start with the Oilers. **Connor McDavid** is having a season that makes Michelangelo’s “David” look lazy—he’s scoring game-tying goals in the final two seconds like it’s his day job. But even he can’t single-handedly offset a team that’s **0-3 in their last three road games** and hasn’t cracked a 3-game win streak yet this season. Add in the fact that Edmonton’s \*\*defense looks like a sieve left in a hurri

Anyway, with all that said, I present to you, the one and only u/shiraicon, this special video, featuring everyone else familiar with you. I hope you see this and enjoy it.

And before you say anything else, yes, the video unfortunately doesn't have voices, nor the special animated part, like the Halloween special, mainly due to having neither Google Veo (or Sora AI) and any available voices at the moment (Couldn't find the right voices for everyone on Elevenlabs).

In fact, the original idea was to have everyone voice act for the video, and sing the birthday song to you as everyone plays their instruments, with your pookie and Alice doing the singing. But because of poor planning from me and not having any of the things I needed to make it happen, it's at least the best I can do with what I have for your special day.

But maybe, JUST MAYBE, I'll someday do it and have everyone (INCLUDING YOU LYNN) make it happen, full send, no exceptions. I WILL KEEP PEAKING AND BREAKING LIMITS, AND YOU'RE COMING WITH ME FOR THAT.

It Just Reactivated.","Today, I turned thirty years old. I didn’t even remember it was my birthday until Becca from Claims showed up at my cubicle with a little cupcake from one of those overpriced bakeries in the arts district. She said she made a special trip there on her way in—just for me.

“Happy Birthday, Jess!”

It was a genuinely kind gesture, and I knew it. I wanted to say something heartfelt. Something like, “Thank you so much for thinking of me, that’s really kind.” But what actually came out of my mouth was:

“Cheers.”

I’ve never said that in my life. It’s not my thing. I’m not British. I’m not charming. And I definitely don’t deserve cupcakes from people who are just trying to be nice.

Becca gave me a tight smile, nodded, and walked off. I pretended I didn’t see the awkwardness on her face, and she pretended it didn’t sting.

I spent twenty minutes in the bathroom trying to cry quietly into a handful of scratchy paper towels. I ran through about a hundred ways to apologize.

I imagined buying her cookies from a rival artisanal bakery. I’d drop them off with a funny note. I’d make her laugh. Maybe we’d all go out for drinks and karaoke. Maybe I’d finally let myself be normal.

But the truth is, I’m not. Not anymore.

My coworkers are always trying to include me. Birthday cards. Invites to parties in the break room. Warm smiles and polite conversation. I always say I’ve got a meeting or I’m on deadline. It’s easier than trying to explain what’s wrong with me—why I can’t join in.

Maybe this story will explain why.

Earlier today, my mom called. I didn’t pick up. I knew why she was calling. She always gets emotional on my birthday. She wants to talk about Ashley.

That's the last thing I want to do.

Ashley was my older sister. Nine years older. She was beautiful and clever and knew everything about everything. I followed her around like a shadow, desperate to be just like her. I wore what she wore. I copied her handwriting. If she liked a song, I memorized every lyric.

And for a while, she didn’t mind. She let me orbit her world like a tiny, annoying moon. She'd give me advice on boys, even though I didn’t like boys yet. She’d let me sit on her bed while she painted her nails and told me about how Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's marriage was in trouble.

Then, one Christmas, she got a computer.

It was 2003. She was sixteen. The internet back then wasn’t like it is now. It felt... lawless. There were corners of it that didn’t feel human. Places that had been online since the early '90s and never shut down—just festering in the dark. Waiting.

At first, Ashley let me sit beside her while she surfed the web. We’d type dumb questions into Ask Jeeves like, “Do Sharks Ever Get Braces?” But eventually, she started shutting her door at night. Started locking it. If I knocked, she’d scream at me to go away.

She got quieter. More withdrawn. Stopped dating. Stopped joking. She had these dark circles under her eyes, like she wasn’t sleeping. I caught her whispering to herself once, repeating a phrase over and over, like a prayer. I still remember it:

>“I have to climb.”

I didn’t understand what that meant.

Then, one day, I faked being sick so I could stay home from school. I waited until Mom got busy in the kitchen and then snuck into Ashley’s room. I turned on her computer, used the password I’d memorized—jessicasimpsonsux—and opened Internet Explorer.

She had a bunch of bookmarks. Teen gossip blogs. Music lyrics. Nick Lachey fansites.

But one stood out.

[deathcipher.com](http://deathcipher.com)

It looked old. Even for back then. Black background, white text. One sentence in the middle of the screen:

""Solve the Puzzle.""

Underneath was a string of gibberish. Or maybe a code. I didn’t recognize it. I clicked around, but that was it. No links. No images. Just that one line and the box.

I didn’t understand what I was seeing, but I felt wrong just looking at it. Like the website was looking back. Like something had noticed me.

I shut off the computer, went back to my bed, and spent the rest of the day feeling those eyes on me. Feeling tracked. When Ashley came home from school, she went into her room. I almost went in and asked her about it. I sometimes wonder, if I had gone to her, would it have all turned out different?

Two weeks before my birthday, Ashley had an incident at school. The school janitor caught her on the roof. She had leaned a ladder up against the brick wall and climbed up. He found her up there staring out over the city. The details get fuzzy after that, because we only got Ashley's version.

I guess he tried to get her to respond, maybe touched her shoulder, but somehow he startled her and ended up going over the edge. It was only two stories, but he landed on his head. He didn’t die right away, but he never woke up, either.

Ashley got suspended indefinitely, pending an investigation. When I asked her why she was up there, she simply said: “He told me to climb.”

At the time, I thought she meant the janitor. I assumed he was the one who told her to go up there. None of it really made sense to me, but some part of me still believed she was the sister I had always known.

A week later, my mom had decided to move full steam ahead with my birthday party despite the cloud hanging over the household. She asked me to grab some ribbons from the basement. On the way back up, I saw Ashley’s bedroom door cracked open. Her backpack was on the bed, but she was in the shower.

I don’t remember deciding to look. I just did.

Inside one of her notebooks were pages and pages of strange words. Scrawled like she was trying to work something out—like the act of writing them was keeping something at bay. Some were crossed out, others circled. At the bottom of one page, she’d written something that’s stayed with me ever since:

“Who sits at the top of the ladder?”

I heard the shower turn off so I shoved the notebook back in her bag and went back to helping my mom. If I was older, maybe I would've understood how ominous all this was. Maybe I could've connected all the dots and seen that something was really wrong with my sister.

But I woke up on the day of my birthday expecting cake and games with all my friends. They were all supposed to arrive at two, and I anxiously hovered as my mother prepared everything in the kitchen.

I didn't actually see Ashley that day. I only heard her bedroom door open and close. By the time I stepped up to the bay windows and looked down the hall, she was gone. I thought she went into the bathroom, but she actually went into the basement.

I didn’t realize anything was wrong until the doorbell rang. The first guest had arrived—a girl from my class named Caroline—and Mom went to let her in. That’s when she noticed the basement door was cracked open.

“Ashley?” she called.

No answer.

She opened the door fully, took a step down, and screamed.

I remember her scream more than anything else from that day. I remember how her hand shook when she reached for the phone. I remember the way the cops spoke in hushed voices, like they didn’t want to wake something.

Ashley was found at the bottom of the basement stairs. No bruises. No wounds. Just... gone. Her body was limp but undamaged. Her expression blank. Her pupils dilated like she'd stared at something for a very long time.

The EMTs said her heart had stopped. Just like that. Like a light switching off.

They couldn’t explain it. No drugs in her system. No trauma. No signs of self-harm. The official report said “cardiac arrest of undetermined cause.”

I was seven. I didn’t understand the words they used. I just knew the party was canceled and I didn’t want to go into the basement ever again.

Years passed. I stopped asking questions. Stopped talking about her. And in time, people around me stopped bringing her up at all.

But that website stayed with me.

I never told anyone about it. Not my mom. Not a therapist. Not even a friend. But it was like a sliver buried deep under the skin of my memory. Every so often, it would itch.

After the cupcake incident and the bathroom cry, I found myself sitting at my desk with no more excuses. My mom called and I let it go to voicemail, but then I was thinking about Ashley, and next thing I know, I'm typing.

I didn’t even realize what I typed until I hit enter.

[deathcipher.com](http://deathcipher.com)

It was still live. There was the same phrase: Solve This Puzzle!

And below it I read: “V2lsbCBZb3UgQ2xpbWIgVGhlIExhZGRlcj8=”

I knew what it was instantly—Base64.

See, in the 23 years since I'd last seen it, I'd learned to code. I was in IT at my company. Another easy place to hide.

You drop it into a simple decoder and voila, the message reads: “Will You Climb The Ladder?”

I stared at the dialog box where I was supposed to enter my answer. What the hell. I typed “yes” and pressed enter.

I took the long way to the break room (to avoid Becca) and grabbed a coffee. The strange feeling I had was beginning to fade. Maybe I was letting all the memories get to me. This is why I don't dwell on the past.

But when I came back to my desk, a new email was waiting for me.

It had no subject line.

The sender address was one I hadn’t seen in over twenty years:

[nicklacheylover139@hotmail.com](mailto:nicklacheylover139@hotmail.com)

Ashley’s old email.

I clicked it open.

There was only one line:

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a collision of NHL titans: the **Carolina Hurricanes** (18-9-2) and **Washington Capitals** (18-9-3) square off in a battle that’s less “hockey game” and more “two espresso shots duking it out in a coffee shop.” Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and crown a winner with the precision of a Zamboni on a budget.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Hurricanes enter as slight favorites (-116), while the Capitals (-104) are oddly listed as underdogs, which feels like betting on a penguin to win a speed skating race. But let’s not let the odds fool us—this is a **50-50 coin flip in a hurricane**.

* **Offense vs. Defense**: The Capitals lead the NHL in scoring (103 goals, 3.4/g) and have a +31 goal differential, while the Hurricanes rank 7th in scoring (97 goals) but 11th in goals against (+15 GD). Think of it as a “high-octane espresso” (Caps) vs. a “storm-proof umbrella” (’Canes).
* **Goalie G.O.A.T. Contenders**: Carolina’s **Brandon Bussi** (2.09 GAA, .909 SV%) is on a 9-1-0 tear, while Washington’s **Logan Thompson** (.925 SV%, 2.0 GAA) is the human equivalent of a locked door with a “No Trespassing” sign.
* **Injuries**: Both teams have players out or day-to-day, but neither roster looks like a Jenga tower on the verge of collapse.

The over/under is **6.0-6.5 goals**, and analysts are leaning “Over” because these teams combined for 5.5+ goals in 18 of 29 games this season. In simpler terms: expect more goals than a toddler’s birthday party.

### Digest the News: Ovechkin’s Ageless Magic vs. Bussi’s Cinderella Story

* **Washington’s Secret Weapon**: At 40, **Alexander Ovechkin** is still scoring like he’s dodging retirement. With 29 points (14 goals, 15 assists), he’s the NHL’s version of a vintage wine—better with age. The Caps’ recent 4.3 goals-per-game average? That’s not a number, it’s a **goal-scoring avalanche**.
* **Carolina’s Cinderella Goaltender**: **Brandon Bussi** (9-1-0, 2.09 GAA) is the David to Ovechkin’s Goliath. Aft

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans… or rather, a clash of *one titan and a sieve*. On December 11, 2025, BK Häcken and AEK Larnaca will battle at Gamla Ullevi, where the only thing more porous than Häcken’s defense is the plot of a Netflix thriller. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Swiss watch and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Math Meets Mayhem

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind AEK Larnaca, with decimal odds hovering around **3.2–3.4** (implied probability: \~30–31%), while BK Häcken is the slight favorite at **2.1–2.15** (\~47–48%). The draw? A lukewarm **3.4–3.6** (\~28–29%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not sure either.”

But let’s not let the numbers fool us. Häcken’s “favorite” status is about as reliable as a toaster in a wind tunnel. They’ve earned just two points from four group-stage games, losing three of their last four matches. Their defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese wheel blush, having shipped six goals in four games. Meanwhile, AEK Larnaca has gone **11 matches unbeaten** across all competitions and hasn’t conceded a single goal in their last four Conference League outings. That’s like bringing a flamethrower to a water pistol fight.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Form, and the Eternal Struggle of Midfielders

**BK Häcken**: This team is a case study in “promising potential, baffling execution.” Their top scorer, Dembe, has just *one* goal in the competition—about as prolific as a snail in a drought. Star playmaker Simon Gustafson is out there dishing out assists like a buffet server, but his teammates keep dropping the plate. Häcken’s home games? A mixed bag of “goals for” and “goals against” in six of their last seven, which is the soccer equivalent of a seesaw made of Jell-O.

Adventure Hour: The Show: The First Season: The Pilot

FADE IN:



INT. VOID OF NOTHINGNESS – UNKNOWN TIME



A deep, cliché narrator voice cuts through and does the cliche narrator describes the world while nothing is one screen



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Long ago...



A young GIRL (around 8) interrupts, curious and impatient.



GIRL (O.S.)

How long?



The NARRATOR sighs, disappointed.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Between the clicking noise the sun started making, and the scientist who discovered inter-dimensional travel and used it to be a bad influence on his grandson.

Now, may I continue?



GIRL (O.S.)

I guess.



Another sigh. He’s losing patience.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Kids these days... Not that there are many fleshy ones left.

(clears throat)

Ahem.



EXT. FANTASY WORLD – DAY



A beautiful, vibrant fantasy landscape appears. The camera FLIES through it, bumping into rocks, rustling through tall grass, and zooming over glowing rivers. But the camera is getting distracted like it has ADHD



NARRATOR (V.O.)

There was a world... populated by creatures of wonder and mythical rules...

But it was programmed. Also who made this damn drone come with ADHD?!



The horizon glitches and peels away with an array of light blue squares, revealing a massive QUEUE of SCI-FI CHARACTERS waiting beneath towering GUARDS with high-tech weapons.



A YOUNG BOY blurts out, interrupting again.



BOY (O.S.)

What do you mean by that? 



The NARRATOR sighs louder — this time, truly irritated.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Shut up and listen!



His tone drips with disdain. The GIRL snaps back.



GIRL (O.S.)

You don’t tell us what to do, fossil!



The NARRATOR SCREAMS. A sci-fi BLAST echoes. Chaos erupts — laser noises, explosions, the sound of energy weapons clashing.



A WHOOSH cuts through the noise. The BOY shouts in protest.



BOY (O.S.)

HEY, NO ROCKET BOOTS!!



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Heh... heheh... HEYAA!







The chaos of the OS battle fades away.



In place of the OS battle the intro song plays. Sarah is shown sitting on a rock with a guitar next to a rainbow river. She looks at the horizon and the camera flies over there to a hut filled with people dancing. When the song starts naming characters they are shown here. During the song’s end, Sarah jumps up and her animation gets all anime esque while she dramatically grabs a pizza mid air. 



SARAH, ZAREEK, & DIESEL (VO)

We’re not heroes, we’re barely allowed

in public with sharp things or near a crowd—

but strap in tight, ‘cause ready or not,

we’re the best worst crew that the stars have got. 

 There's Sarah, Diesel, Spider Robot, The Narrator and his Grandchildren, ""Walter White"" Goblin, Jasmin, Grandma Elder God Thing, Plus the griffin flying in the sky who ate a mushroom that was alive!

And, uh… I guess Zareek arrived. 

Adventure Hour! Adventure Time was taken! 

Laugh at dumb jokes we've been makin' for months cuz we've been takin' our damn time.

 Don't steal the jokes they are mine!

There’s the dragon who sued us for parking in the sky,

the wizard whose spell made all pigeons ask “why,”

Don’t forget the kingdom run by a clam,

the sentient sandwich that yelled “eat me if you can!”

the lich who takes coupons, the bard who won’t rhyme—

it’s dangerous here, but we still illegally sell soda that tastes of lime! 

Our budget’s unstable, the plot’s in denial,

half the cast weren’t hired, they were just kidnapped legally and in style—

if we make it to episode two, dude, that’s wild!

Adventure Hour! (Please don’t change the channel, Dave needs money to feed his child!)

The animators begged us to keep things small,

but we added a griffin, a demon, and a mall—

Adventure Hour! (OSHA inspectors, please don’t call!)









A vast mechanical waiting queue stretches endlessly. Three people are assigned to each other.



DIESEL, an adrenaline junkie chasing the thrill of “true adventure.” He’s pure chaos-literally. We’ll reveal that the God of chaos is actually his dad but play it off as a joke

SARAH, a young woman who’s left the complex world behind — she hates politics. She’s pure nihilism 



ZAREEK, a man in his thirties who tagged along with Diesel and Sarah to escape the feeling that everyone back home was better than him. He’s pure “When can I get back to the couch?”

INT. DAY — WAITING QUEUE



Sarah stands in front of a guard. Her eyes glow blue, revealing the eyeball inside her skull — she’s being scanned.



The guard’s eyes flicker with the same glow as he completes the scan.



A loud CLANKING OF METAL ON METAL echoes through the queue.



A massive spider-like robot stomps into view, its upper body humanoid, its legs metallic and sharp. It’s movements are speedy and frantic.



ROBOT

(toneless)

Terrorist spotted.



Its arm transforms into a massive cannon, locking onto Sarah.



The guard steps in front of the beam.



GUARD

Whoa, whoa, calm down clanker!



His eyes flash again, projecting a holographic image of Sarah’s identification papers.



GUARD

She’s not a terrorist!



The robot hesitates, its mechanical face twisting — confused, then oddly… sad.



ROBOT

I am sorry for the potentially dangerous son-ar-io.

I will head to the reprogramming cen-tre.



The strange annunciation of its words sends a chill down Zareek’s spine.



The familiar CLANK CLANK CLANK of its legs fades away.



GUARD

(grumbling)

Fucking circuit chewing cog creature...

(then, louder)

Alright, head through.



He gestures toward the fantasy realm beyond the gate.



EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS – DAY

 

DIESEL’S HAND brushes frantically across the frame, wiping away the previous scene like dust. The image dissolves into a cloud, which is shown to be ZAREEK’S FLASHBACK.



The trio rides on a carriage clattering down a dirt path.



ZAREEK

What gives?!



DIESEL

Your flashbacks are STUPID, and it doesn’t help that your ANNOYING cursed amulet makes us see them! So STOP reminiscing about something that was ONLY A MONTH AGO!!! 



ZAREEK

You know, while we’re here, we don’t have to do things the right way. We can be a little lazy. And my amulet is fashionable! 



DIESEL

Tch.



The carriage stops abruptly.



The CARRIAGE DRIVER turns, his booming southern drawl echoing.



CARRIAGE DRIVER

Well, here ye stop!!



The trio steps off and heads into a bustling city square filled with color, sound, and life.



DIESEL

Why are we here again?



SARAH

We ran out of AH-pehels. So we’re here to buy AH-pehels. We’re going to trade coin for AH-pehel.



DIESEL

Please stop pronouncing “apple” like that.



SARAH

No.



DIESEL walks up to a nearby fruit vendor after passing shops like: “Ye Olde Tax Fraud” – sells fake ledgers and discount shell companies. “Potions R Us” – everything’s labeled “probably healing.” “Target (Actual Target)” – archery range disguised as a department store. “Reincarnation Station” – 10% off if you died stupidly.“Spoiler Scrolls” – fortune teller spoils upcoming plot twists for gold.“Goblin King’s Wings” – slogan: “We kidnapped the flavor!”“Tavern & Error” – glitchy sign constantly flickers 404 ALE NOT FOUND.“Yeast Mode Bakery” – tagline: “Bread stronger than your dad.”“Coffee & Consequences” – baristas in full executioner gear.

“Frogurt of the Gods” – mascot: an actual frog screaming in divine ecstasy.“Apple Store (not that one)” – they literally just sell apples. Bad ones.

“Quest Diagnostics” – “Get tested for plot relevance.” “Wish.com — Literal Edition” – everything you buy comes cursed.“Rent-a-Sidekick” – hourly charge, no refunds if they die heroically.“Therapy for Sentient Blades” – lobby full of whispering swords.“Cloud 9 Storage” – ethereal vapor warehouse for rent.“Fantasy DMV” – line of dragons renewing flight licenses.“The Loan Ranger” – one masked guy aggressively offering microloans.

“iScroll” – overpriced magic tablets, 1% more battery life than a rock.“Runescape Repair” – actual runes being hammered by goblins.“A.I. (Actual Imps)” – small creatures yelling ideas at businessmen.“Department of Unfinished Quests” – filled with people waiting eternally.“Ministry of Overcompensation” – all employees wear massive pauldrons.”Fantasy HOA” – bans dragons, noise, and emotional expression.“Local Oracle Union” – picketing with signs saying “THE END IS NEAR (AGAIN).”“Taxidermy & Taxes” – “We skin your wallet too!”“The Existential Deli” – every sandwich questions its purpose.“Used Dreams” – shelves of glowing, slightly depressed orbs “The Pun Forge” – blacksmiths only make weapons with pun names.

Btw if this is trimmed you animators HAVE to put a sign in the background saying: “Couldn’t fit all visual gags :( -Kai”



DIESEL

Do you have apples?



A brash lady in a Russian accent is lighting a cigarette behind the booth.



LADY

I’m busy.



DIESEL

OK. You’re not supposed to have a cig though. This is fantasy IDIOT



DIESEL walks around bored as all hell and notices a wanted poster for a goblin building a bio weapon that would turn all life forms into goblins. The Goblin is disgusting and repulsive. The freak is also dancing in one of the paintings on the poster



“WANTED ALIVE SO WE CAN TORTURE THAT FUCKER! don’t ask how he’s dancing in a painting. His freaky knows no bounds” The poster reads.



DIESEL

Y’all should see this! 



The other two strut over to DIESEL.



ZAREEK

5,000 gold?! If its worth that much it must be hard work… You sure? 

DIESEL

NONSENSE! This is easy gold! 

SARAH

If it gets political I’m out. It also better be a grounded simple adventure. No crazy shit. 



DIESEL

And when we get back we buy our AH-pehels.



SARAH and ZAREEK look confused.



DIESEL

Yeah and now you realize how bad a joke that was, SAR-RAH. 



SARAH looks mildly annoyed



SARAH

Whatever…



The TRIO starts walking from door to door asking people if they’ve seen the GOBLIN in a minute long montage. The montage ends and they’re in a forest.



SARAH kicks a pebble. It screams and sprouts legs, scurrying away.



SARAH

This quest sucks.



ZAREEK

Pppppfffffttt…… Can we do something else? This is so boring it’s unholy.



SARAH

Yeah, if Zareek thinks something is lame it’s either the best or the absolute worst. And I’m going with worst.



DIESEL

Oh, com’on! This is real adventure. 



SARAH

Dude…. We’re in a forest looking for a goblin that we’re not allowed to kill... This sucks ass. 



As SARAH is speaking a GRIFFIN flies away with a living and screaming mushroom that it plucked off a tree. ZAREEK hears that and looks behind to see it happen while SARAH is just about done with her sentence.



DIESEL

Well, I like sucking ass 



A cluster of TREES stop rustling, turn their bark-faces, and look at DIESEL like he just said the corniest thing in the entire forest. One mutters, “Wow… brother thinks he’s spicy.” Another whispers, “Someone get this man a personality.” A third snorts, “I’ve seen liches smoother than that.” Another goes, “Can somebody please show him the way OUT of the forest?” And lastly one cackles “Somebody tell that guy his third grader humor is not tuff.”



SARAH

Gross



DIESEL

Shut and be patient. 



ZAREEK

Guys I just saw a GRIFFIN.. Yeah, A GRIFFIN. Eat a LIVING MUSHROOM. Also I thought Diesel’s thing was to be an adrenaline junkie… Why are you defending this “adventure”?



DIESEL looks like he’s at his wits end. 



DIESEL

Okay…. Let’s just go to a few more doors. Mmkay?



SARAH crosses her arms. 



SARAH

Fine.



DIESEL Sighs and points to a fairy tale looking hut.



DIESEL 

Let’s head into this fairy tale-esque hut. 



ZAREEK

Cool



The TRIO walks up to the door and knock. An elderly woman answers. The woman licks her lips by flicking her tongue like a lizard REALLY quickly and it’s freakish to watch.



Woman

HELLOOOO deeries! How may me helping youuoououououououou?! 



SARAH interrupts her.



SARAH

That’s enough. No one should pronounce you like that.



DIESEL

Ahem,. We’re looking for a goblin-



The elder woman interrupts joyfully



Woman

OOOOHHHHHH! I know! You see, I’m an elder god and I’m omniscient and that gobly is over 13 Nimnoots there, then take a left at 65 feet, when you’ve gone 0.0005 miles take a right then at 0.03 meters over there you’ll see him. 



The woman’s face distorts and her teeth become sharp and creepy looking.



Woman

OH, AND ALSO,, if you stop by Gleebglorb’s house, tell ‘em to stop texting me. We had our divorce like 13 years ago.



The tiro exchange glances then it cuts to black and then shows the trio walking through the forest using the woman’s instructions.



DIESEL Is yelling at the others



DIESEL

Fuck y’all! (Semi incoherent babbling) LOOK WHO WAS RRRRIIIIIIIIIGHT!! DIESEL!! I’MMMM the best. Y’ALL ARE DUMB AND WERE WHINNING!! I’M BETTER THAN YOU COCKSUCKERS- 



SARAH interrupts his rant



SARAH

Can you please shut up? You shot our swear count up like 300. We’re not Rick And Morty.



ZAREEK

Heeeyyy that’s the second time we mentioned them.



SARAH and DIESEL look annoyed

SARAH & DIESEL 

SCREW YOU ZARREEK.



SARAH & DIESEL become not understandable as they say different things to diss ZAREEK.



The scene cuts to them at the location the insane woman told them to go



EXT. FOREST CLEARING – DAY – BUNKER



The trio stands before the structure.

It’s just a plain metal bunker. No magic. No glow. No runes. Just a bunker with a steel door in the dirt. There are some vines on it but nothing other than that.



ZAREEK

(confused)

It’s… just a bunker.



SARAH spins toward him like he just kicked a puppy.



SARAH

“Just a bunker?” JUST a bunker?! We’re in a fantasy world, you braindead fruit snack! A bunker is basically an extinction-level event of weirdness! IDIOT!!



Diesel recoils like she just slapped him.



DIESEL

Whoa— okay, that was… kinda a lot, Sarah.





SARAH

…Shit…. You’re right.

I still hate you, Zareek. You give off “eats crayons” energy.



Zareek just sighs



ZAREEK

Stop fucking around, lets get this door open.



The camera cuts to black and fades with Zareek opening the door. When this happens, the characters switch to rotoscope and their eyes squint weirdly. The camera then cuts to what the trio is looking at: A bunch of goblins are in a makeshift lab that looks out of Breaking Bad with three goblins in the back watching Breaking Bad and directing the others to imitate it perfectly. One goblin stirs blue goop while checking the show to make sure they’re doing it “right,” and tries to get it the correct color and and grabs a bottle of bleach and shakes it in frantically but it’s empty and he looks inside the bottle with tears in his eyes. One goblin is dressed as Walter White. It’s such a poor attempt though he looks like Adolf Hitler and other goblins stare in disgust. Two goblins are snickering about the “Walter White.” 



Goblin 1

Is it-No it can’t just be me. That Walter White looks like Hitler, doesn’t he? 



The other goblin speaks out in a guttural and deep voice



Goblin 2

Yeah, y-yeah. He does. You’re not wrong, Jasmin.



Jasmin sounds even angrier and points at “Walter White.”



Jasmin

Look, he even got a ketchup stain on his arm!



Goblin 2

Yeah it looks like an armband. I-I-I-I-I-I-W-W-W-W-We have to tell him



Jasmin

Agreed.



SARAH

(sucks air in through her teeth — the universal “yikes” sound)

Lets just kill ‘em, right? 



The others nod. 



ZAREEK

Mmhm. 



DIESEL

Yeah, I mean, nobody wants to tell some their shirt is inside out let alone that their accidentally dressed as……. Ya know…



In the background, the two goblins confront the “Walter White” and he screams: “I JUST WANTED TO SCIENCE GOOD!!” and the others try to calm him down.



Sarah pulls out a sword and readies for battle and then charges the goblins as both she and the goblins scream. 



ZAREEK

Do you still have that rocket pistol?



Diesel nods yes and pulls out a squarish pistol with rockets in its barrel



DIESEL

Oh yeah.



ZAREEK

My man!



The camera moves to Diesel’s shoulder and flips over to show him shooting rockets at goblins and Sarah who’s covered in blood and finishing of a goblin



DIESEL

Gah, none of these are our target. 



SARAH

Then lets find him



The trio walk through a door, entering a hangar and see their target in a wooden plane flying off.



DIESEL 

Quick! There are two others! We can still get him! I, um, guess this isn’t a fantasy adventure anymore.



ZAREEK

Yeah…



Diesel runs to a plane and flies off while the camera stays trained on Zareek and Sarah



SARAH

Glad we get to see that.



ZAREEK

Uh-huh.



Zareek looks at the camera

ZAREEK

Wait, the camera’s looking at us. Are we doing that thing where we don’t show something cool to save animation budget?



Sarah gasps, steps back, and puts a hand over her mouth. 



SARAH

Oh, you figured it out! 



Zareek also puts a hand over his mouth



ZAREEK

What, why are doing this? Why do you have a hand over your mouth?



SARAH 

Saves animation budget by not animating the mouth.



ZAREEK

OOooohhhh, smart!



Sarah points at the remaining plane



SARAH

Oh my God, look! They have breathing masks! We can save like 100 to 150 dollars or something like that. I don’t know I’m not an animator. Unlike animators, I actually get paid well. 



Sarah is about to say something but Zareek interrupts her.



ZAREEK

Could you please stop that meta stuff? It’s not funny anymore and that last bit was kinda meanspirited.



Sarah and Zareek get in the last wooden plane and the camera cuts to them flying towards the goblin and Diesel in their planes.



This section should have a lot of improve because I’m the worst at writing action



Diesel is shooting wood chips at the goblin’s plane but the goblin turns around and uses an acorn launcher to shoot acorns at Diesel’s plane



DIESEL

Seriously?! Acorns?! Why does fiction believe that acorns are explosive? THEY CAN’T BE USED AS WEAPONS!



The animation becomes really simple and cheap



ZAREEK

Seriously? We couldn’t afford the finale?



SARAH

We spent the entire budget on the goblins. They had detailed teeth and fingernails, Zareek.



DIESEL (OS)

Uhh, no we didn’t, Sarah! When I shot a rocket at one of their fingernails flew past me but the audience didn’t see because the animators didn’t animate that.



ZAREEK

Yeah, I saw that happen. You’re wrong Sarah.





The animation becomes normal again



SARAH

Yes! We’re back!



Sarah readies herself



SARAH

Alright Zareek, I’m doing something risky. Hold on! 



Sarah crashes her plane into the goblin’s plane. They get launched into an invisible surface that becomes visible and is revealed to be a sci-fi plane from outside the fantasy world. The camera lingers on an advertisement



Advertisement: “Hate your life? Want to leave your world behind for just a bit? Then come to a ‘Generic government owned vacation company’ facility. Visit Fantasy worlds, Staer Wors, or zombie apocalypse 2020 just better because less racism.”



The goblin stumbles and steps on Zareek’s amulet. Zareek pulls himself out of rubble and looks shocked then pissed



ZAREEK

You broke my amulet…



The goblin looks confused



GOBLIN

W-What? Is that your-... Is that your, like,, motivation? I’m confused… 



The goblin looks at Diesel in his plane



GOBLIN

Did you know about this? Did I miss something? Or is that a dumb motivation? It’s just an amulet right? Because that can’t be your motivation.



Zareek charges the goblin while yelling



GOBLIN

Oh, no you don’t! 



The goblin pulls out an ancient artifact and everything starts to look satanic. The goblin then jumps off the sci-fi plane and turns into a PNG fish. The camera cuts to Zareek stoping his charge and looking confused and repulsed. The camera then cuts to the goblin as the PNG fish turning back into his normal self and using a parachute to survive the landing. He dusts off and is about to head off when a few peasants see him.



Peasant

Ay, it da bastard wit der fancy goblinizing chemical! 



A bunch of peasants start yelling nonsense



A woman with a child in her arms points at the goblin



Woman

That goblin ate my baby and now I hallucinate that I still have him in my arms!



The crowd becomes a mob and attack the goblin, climaxing when they throw him through a window onto a table with a baby in front of him. He looks at the baby and eats it very akin to how Mr. Frog from Smiling Friends eats people.



Woman

YOU SEE?!?! I’m not crazy! He eats babies!! My poor baby… His name was Davey..



Peasant

He does eat babies but your child is right there… 



Woman

What?



Peasant

Your-.. Davey is right there in your arms.



The woman looks at Davey in her arms, then at the peasant, and continues doing that for 6 seconds



Woman

No.



The camera cuts to the trio 



DIESEL

Hop on



The other hop on his plane and we follow them down for 8 seconds before Zareek breaks the awkward silence



ZAREEK

We’re gonna go kill him now? For real?



SARAH

Yeah, no fucking dur. We’re not going down there to…. Tickle him.



ZAREEK

Rude



Sarah scoffs



DIESEL

We’re here. Woah! Look at that angry mob! Fuckin’ cool!



The trio land and find the goblin dead.



DIESEL

That was unsatisfying.



The goblin’s dead hand falls over and reveals a plastic mold of a middle finger.



SARAH

What a cunt. He spends his last moments planning THAT?



The plastic middle finger starts beeping. Very slowly, then a little faster



DIESEL

Maybe because it’s a bomb



An elderly peasant woman picks up the middle finger bomb

Elderly peasant woman

A toy to give to the ye olde childs!



She tosses the bomb into the crowd. It lands in a child’s hands.



SARAH

Lets run



The trio go far away enough to escape the blast. But there is no blast. Instead the middle finger releases a cloud of the goblinizing chemical. In a gruesome scene, the peasants turn into freakish “goblins.” The peasants were already drawn with more detail but now look disgustingly realistic. The goblins form a horde to chase the trio and immediately lose their high quality animation when they group up and now have a low quality slapstick animation. The trio run through the fantasy setting to get back to the waiting queue. Diesel gets on his phone and calls someone.



DIESEL

Hey…. Could you cancel that doordash order?! I’m being chased by goblins…… ye-... Yeah-ok… Look I’m sorry but it’s not really not my fault I’m getting chased by goblins…. I didn’t mean to be rude when I said that. You know that you’re kinda sensitive, right?…. Oh, and now you’re not gonna cancel it because I called you out, fuck you! 



Diesel hangs up



DIESEL

(mumbling)

Fucking Nancy…



ZAREEK

LOOK! It’s the waiting queue! There are like thirty goblins and one of them has TWO knives, we need to get there NOW!!



SARAH

YEAH WE KINDA KNOW!



DIESEL

SARAH SHUT UP! You’re just as annoying as him!



Sarah looks genuinely offended



SARAH

EXCUSE ME!?!?



The trio narrowly escape into the waiting queue, leaving the goblins outside very confused



Sarah turns around



SARAH

S.R! I haven’t seen you in a long time!



Spider Robot (The one from the start)

We indeed haven’t spoken to each other for a while.



Diesel stops catching his breath to look at Sarah



DIESEL

You’re friends with a clanker?



Spider Robot’s arm turns into a canon like before



SR

DA FUCK DID YOU CALL ME?!



One of the guards intervenes 



Guard

Arachnid Model Android V2956T, deal with the goblins outside. They can’t get through the barrier protecting this waiting queue but it’s still in our best interest that they are killed.



SR sighs



Yes… I will see to it that the goblins outside will be shot thoroughly…



SARAH

Welp… I guess that the pilot has ended. This is an ending, right?



In the background, screams from goblins are heard and there are shadows on the wall showing SR’s brutal killing of the goblin horde



DIESEL

Yeah, this feels like a good ending.



SARAH

Ok, ok, yeah, that’s good. I guess we’ll see YOU folks in like…. A lot of years. Well, actually I guess you’ll be seeing US. Season 1 coming up! Whoo!



FADE OUT



WHEEL WE HAVE A DEAL? 

FADE IN:

A vibrant, lushish, and green landscape filled with unicorns, centaurs, and other horse-like creatures. The camera goes under the ground and through a guarded bunker into a meeting room with two men in tuxedos. Jonathan The Third has a huge and creepy smile but can somehow still talk normally through clenched teeth.



JONATHAN THE THIRD

Ah, shall we start our formal discussion about the unpleasant matters plaguing us?



RICHMOND THE RICH MAN

Yes, Jonathan, we sha-



A narrator above them interrupts. Unlike the last one, his voice is young and he sounds like he’s in his 20’s.



NARRATOR (V.O.)

Ahhhh, nature… It’s even more wondrous in fantasy! But something even better will happen in this episode. The trio go to a fair! Oh, and, by the way, I’m replacing the last guy because… Well… When he got into a fight with his grandkids he… gah… He shot them. He’s hopefully getting the death penalty because.. How could you even do that? Committing murder-KILLING CHILDREN-over an argument? Things aren’t getting any better….



The two businessmen look back down at eachother



RICHMOND THE RICH MAN

I think he’s done… So, lets talk business! Our cars that malfunction on purpose are up in sales by 1.4%! But the robots we’re selling that commit acts of terrorism’s sales are down 0.2%... 



JONATHAN THE THIRD

Not to mention that ROTTEN kid who blew up our dead people sandwich factory…  What should me do about him, Richmond?



RICHMOND THE RICH MAN

Hmmm… Oh! The fair’s in town! 



JONATHAN THE THIRD

And? 



RICHMOND THE RICH MAN

We can sell glazed cockroaches and fried rats. AND…If we blow the farris wheel off its hinges, it will roll towards the orphanage and kill that kid sabotaging us! MUHAHAHAMUHAHA!



As Richmond laughs, a goblin naked and his neck chained to the wall, starts scribbling on a piece of paper. He shows it to the two businessmen who nod in approval at his terrible drawing of a wheel destroying an orphanage.



A corpse comes in wearing a janitor uniform and wipes down a sign that says “EVIL MEETING ROOM,” and his supervisor, who’s a necromancer, walks in.



NECROMANCER

AHH, YES! I found you! Come with me, Undead and Unpaid Intern Number 134260.



The necromacer’s voice is high pitched and fast.



Janitor

Yes, boss…



The undead janitor speaks in a monotone, deep, and slow voice, like he’s worked at the company for years. The necromancer piggybacks on the janitor



NECROMANCER

HURRY UP, WAGIE! 



And finally, the intro song plays. Sarah is shown sitting on a rock with a guitar next to a rainbow river. She looks at the horizon and the camera flies over there to a hut filled with people dancing. When the song starts naming characters they are shown there. During the song’s end, Sarah jumps up and her animation gets all anime esque while she dramatically grabs a pizza mid air. 



SARAH, ZAREEK, & DIESEL (VO)

We’re not heroes, we’re barely allowed

in public with sharp things or near a crowd—

but strap in tight, ‘cause ready or not,

we’re the best worst crew that the stars have got. 

 There's Sarah, Diesel, Spider Robot, The two Narrators, Richmond the rich man, Jonathan the third, The background gag sentient hand, Diesel’s evil twin with a tan, Plus the griffin flying in the sky who ate a mushroom that was alive!

And, uh… I guess Zareek arrived. 

Adventure Hour! Adventure Time was taken! 

Laugh at dumb jokes we've been makin' for months cuz we've been takin' our damn time.

 Don't steal the jokes they are mine!

There’s the dragon who sued us for parking in the sky,

the wizard whose spell made all pigeons ask “why,”

Don’t forget the kingdom run by a clam,

the sentient sandwich that yelled “eat me if you can!”

the lich who takes coupons, the bard who won’t rhyme—

it’s dangerous here, but we still illegally sell soda that tastes of lime! 

Our budget’s unstable, the plot’s in denial,

half the cast weren’t hired, they were just kidnapped legally and in style—

The cyborg that lives in the wild!

Adventure Hour! (Please don’t change the channel, Dave needs money to feed his child!)

The animators begged us to keep things small,

but we added a griffin, a demon, and a mall—

Adventure Hour! (OSHA inspectors, please don’t call!)



The camera cuts to the trio at the vibrant fair. Zareek’s hand reaches for a glazed cockroach but Sarah slaps his hand



SARAH

Those are cockroaches, don’t eat ‘em



ZAREEK

Damn. Thanks.



DIESEL

Ahhhh man! This is awesome! Do you guys know how many indie animated shows have slice of life episodes? Not many! There’s HIGH demand and us going to the fair fills it



ZAREEK

Well, we’re here to have fun, mmkay? It’d be dumb to come here and not go on one of these epic rides. Like, like that, that Spluj-Splungy-Splugoony-Splumgo?



SARAH

Splaganny Gopperstein. 



ZAREEK

Wow I thou-



SARAH

I know, it should not be pronounced like that. 



ZAREEK

Well, it looks fun.



An elderly man bumps into Sarah and spills all of the water he was carrying in a bucket on Diesel. Diesel turns around annoyed but then a dream sequence happens. Colorful and chaotic imagery fills the screen. It looks like Diesel just took LSD and when it ends Diesel’s eyes keep changing color plus he’s completely rotoscoped. 





SARAH

Dude! Watch where you’re going!



DIESEL

Whoa! You bumped into her? Yo fuck you! Why ain’t you say sorry? Huh?!



Diesel starts to kick the elderly man’s ass. It’s a completely one-sided beatdown and Zareek and Sarah have to intervene.



ZAREEK

Ok buddy, that was enough.



SARAH

Yeah, thanks, you… Really showed him. G-G-Good job. That was a real bang up ya did back there.





DIESEL

I’LL KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS, MAN!



Diesel finally stops fighting and the others let go of him. Sarah’s panting from holding diesel back.



SARAH

Me and Diesel are gonna go on that rollercoater… 



ZAREEK

Cool. I’m going to check out that fun maze. Those mirrors are always cool.



SARAH

(In between pants.) 

…OK…



Zareek walks into the fun house. In one mirror, a weird, skinny human who’s purple is begging Zareek to let him out, “Please… I don’t know how long I’ve been here… YOU NEED TO FREE ME!!” but seconds after he turns into sand. In another mirror there’s a plastic looking modern human with a cellphone in his hands and a camera behind him.



MODERN HUMAN

Smile for Tiktok! You’re on camera! TRY OUT THIS NEW BITCOIN IT GAVE ME BILLIONS OVERNIGHT! BUY MY MERCH MADE BY UNDERPAID LABOROURS IN CHINA!! GET MICRO TRANSACTIONS IN MY MOBILE GAME!! FOLLOW ME AND MY OTHER ACCOUNTS!! SHARE THIS VID CHAT!!



Zareek walks past the modern human and messes around with a mirror, fun visibly implanted on his face. He uses the mirror to make himself look fat, tall, multi-headed, and other things. He starts to walk out to an exit and very far in the background a clown that looks like Pennywise, with his mouth unhinged, is licking a glass rectangle with a small child in it. the Pennywise esque clown looks just like a medieval jester the shape of Pennywise. Next to the Pennywise, there's a sign that says ""I'M NOT PENNYWISE. IF YOU SAY I AM I'LL EAT YOUR BALLS.” Then, a familiar voice is heard, it’s Jonathan The Third. He’s screaming in a nearby bathroom.



JONATHAN THE THIRD

WHAT?!?! NO TOILET PAPER?!? Preposterous!! My top 1%, upper class self deserves better! I guess I’ll use this… 



Jonathan The Third walks out with his weird smile still there even though his eyes are showing anger. He throws down what he used as toilet paper: The plan to blow up the wheel



ZAREEK

Uh… Gross



Zareek looks at the piece of paper on the ground

 I'm working in the electronics department at Goodwill currently and I want to price items fairly and make sure we're putting out stuff you guys actually would want to purchase. 

One of the biggest issues I see right now is over pricing for kitchen appliances, the guy before me would price used coffee pots for like $15 and frankly since none of us have the funds for that, I want to find prices that will actually help out the community we're supposed to be putting these items out for. I don't care about the numbers Corporate Goodwill sets, I want our customers to have a chance to actually shop the way Goodwill's mission originally intended them too. 

I know the average prices that Goodwill corporate wants us to set per item, the number of items we're supposed to price in a day, and I want to average things out in a way that benefits the shoppers the most.

TL; DR: 

What electronics items do you really want to see at Goodwill? Kitchen appliances like coffee pots? Blenders? Crock pots? Air fryers? Obscure or extra stuff like popcorn makers/juicers?

Gaming stuff? Consoles, games, controllers, monitors?

Speakers? Music stuff like instruments, keyboards? Lawn mowers? Lamps? Clocks?

Computers? Cords or phone cases?

Food cost, vendor pricing, waste, yield, daily operating spend, labor burn… none of it talks to each other. Every decision is reactive because the data is scattered across invoices, POS, spreadsheets, and someone’s head.

So I started building **NibbleIQ**, an operations-intelligence layer that pulls all the back-office chaos into a single place. Right now the MVP focuses on:

* OCR invoice ingestion (accurate line-item extraction)
* Ingredient-level price tracking
* Daily operating spend and vendor trends
* Basic yield + menu cost insights
* Simple dashboards to show “what actually happened today”

No accounting, no POS replacement, no bloated ERP. Just clarity.

I’ve been validating with operators I know personally, and the reaction has been consistent:

*“This is the stuff we track on five spreadsheets and still get wrong.”*

A few groups already offered to pilot it as soon as the MVP stabilizes, which is encouraging  but I want unbiased eyes on this before going further.

**My questions for this sub:**

1. Does the problem resonate, or does it feel too niche?
2. Is the scope too big for an MVP, or is it focused enough?
3. For early-stage validation, would you push deeper on invoice automation or on menu/yield economics first?
4. Anything about this direction that sets off alarm bells for you?

I’m not here to sell anything just looking for founder-level perspective before I fully commit to a broader rollout.

1pjoyvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1pjoyvc/how_do_i_support_my_dad_while_im_drowning/,How Do I Support My Dad While I'm Drowning?,"Brief back story.  Dad (71M) was diagnosed with Stage 3a NSCLC in January after experiencing intense shouldblade-area pain.  He moved in with us to seek trearment at the nearby university hospital after living with his girlfriend 3 hours away.  The move was originally meant to be temporary, but due to complications with his chemo/radiation, some pretty intense weight loss and weakening, and now a return of his shoulder pain, he has now lived with us all year.

He has always been a stubborn ""my way or the highway"" kind of guy, and I was trained well as a kid to never defy him - so the dynamic since he has lived with us has morphed from me taking care of him because it was medically NECESSARY, to me taking care of him because he practically demands it - and he is not an easy patient or even a nice person most of the time.

Here's where we're at now... after radiation eliminated his pain for months and he was actually quite pleasant, it began returning in August.  Since then, it has been a struggle to find pain relief - and his mood has darkened progressively.  What began as ""nerve pain"" (he describes pain like fire burning around his shoulder blade and armpit) has now developed into debilitating pain that basically causes him to just SIT, all day, every day.

For awhile, he would go to his bedroom and close the door if his pain was flaring.  He'd alternate heat and ice and find some relief.  Then it got to the point that the heat and ice weren't cutting it, so he was referred to pain management.  They offered gabapentin, which seems so far to be the thing that has helped the most.  He became a bit more pleasant, was able to do a bit more for himself without having constant pain, and it was becoming evident that he could transition to living with his girlfriend again, or living on his own.  Because remember, he asked to live with us temporarily for treatment - not permanently.

In late September/early October, I began asking him what his wishes were for the future, so that I could help plan and coordinate his move back to his girlfriends house.  He would avoid the conversation or change the subject.  I expressed that I could tell he was getting stronger, so we needed to start thinking of how things would look when he was ready to move out.  He expressed that he couldn't go back to his girlfriend's home until his pain was managed.  

We made more appointments with pain management and also spoke to his oncologist.  The oncologist said that they were pretty confident that this is radiation neuralgia/neuropathy, and that it likely will never go away entirely.  They are working with him to help relieve his pain to a point that he can function, but he will never be 100% pain free.  Here is where the problem really comes in.  They have mentioned gabapentin and Lyrica, depression medication and therapy (because his pain is worsening his depression, and they think that therapy could help him develop coping skills to help distract himself or calm himself), and physical therapy/exercise plans to strengthen the muscles in hopes of lessening the strain in that area.  He refuses ALL intervention except nerve medications.  He will not see a therapist, he will not go to physical therapy, and he will not exercise.

When the gabapentin helped him and I noticed he started to do more for himself, I stopped doing things for him that I KNEW he could do.  When my behavior changed, so did his.  He began voicing his pain to me constantly.  Every conversation revolved around it.  He has never really asked me a lot of questions about myself or my life before, but he stopped asking or caring all together.  I've tried to help support him through this, but you can only lead a horse to water.  I get him to all his appointments, I reach out to his doctors, I make sure we have heating pads and ice packs and all his medications.

The back and forth with all of this has been mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting on him - but it has been all of those things for me, too.  And I don't just have him to think about.  I have my own responsibilities with my own family and business and health to think about it.  But because I'm his only support system, he only has ME to vent his frustrations to (my sister lives 2 hours away, and his only other person is his girlfriend who lives 3 hours away).

In early November, my sister came for a brief visit and we tried to encourage him to go to physical therapy.  He got angry at us and retreated to his bedroom.  A couple days after that, I confronted him after he was having a particularly snarky morning and told him that managing his life, my life, my kids lives and all the other responsibilities was beginning to break me and I needed help.  He said he would do more for himself and that he knew I was doing too much for him.  

I reiterated that we needed to get him back to some independence and autonomy, because this wasn't meant to be a permanent move.  Either he could go back to his girlfriend (he again said he can't do that until his pain improves), go to an apartment (he said that would be a ""death sentence""), or go to an independent living apartment complex (he didn't say much about that, but shook his head 'no').  I told him that it was important that he has his own space and that me and my family can reclaim our space.  He said he could ""go anywhere"" (in my house) if we needed the family room or shared spaces, all we had to do was say the word - but he would not discuss moving out, he'djust talk AROUND it.  I finally got frustrated and had to end the conversation because it wasn't going anywhere.

Two days later, he posted up on my sofa saying he couldn't get comfortable in bed and has now stayed there 24/7 ever since.  He has been on my living room couch for a month.  He sits there all day.  He sleeps there, sitting up, all night.  He gets up several times a day to go to our garage to smoke cigarettes (yes, he still smokes).  He makes a bowl of cereal for himself, and he WILL make a plate of food for himself when I make dinner.  Beyond that, he does nothing else.  He won't put in his hearing aids, so we can't talk to him.  And he pulls the hood of his robe up over his head to block off his view of everything except the TV.  When I encourage him to go try to sleep in his bed, he claims that he is in too much pain in his bed.  I've offered pillows and cushions to mimic the sofa, and offered to buy a recliner - all of which he refuses.  I even mentioned it again last night and he said he was comfortable there - I said yeah, but its a shared space - he said he'd already been there a month - I said, yeak I know, but thats a problem and he needs to sleep in his room.  He just shrugged his shoulders and went back to staring at the TV.

For awhile leading up to this 24/7 couch behavior, he was reporting that his pain was much better with the 400mg gabapentin, 4 times a day.  Without warning or build-up during the week before Thanksgiving, he stopped taking it regularly.  I wasn't aware that he had stopped taking it... it was the one medication that he controlled entirely on his own because of the timing of the dosages.  

So leading up to Thanksgiving, he was complaining of pain constantly, he was wincing and groaning anytime I'd walk into the room, and frankly, the constant stimulation of hearing him in pain, and SEEING him on my sofa was causing me some of the worst anxiety I've ever experienced in my life.  Think CONSTANT fight or flight.  The day before Thanksgiving was the worst.  I was in the kitchen all day, prepping for Thanksgiving dinner.  And because of the layout of my home, I could see him and he could see me.  

He groaned and winced all day.  Every time he'd get up, he'd groan ""Oh oh oh oh"" the whole time he was on his feet.  It got so bad at one point that I set down the meal prep, and sent a message to his oncologist.  I basically begged them to help me - I didn't know if its progression pain, if its nerve pain, if its depression/anxiety making it worse, if its performative... this is all so far above my skill set.  I didn't KNOW why his pain was worse and I needed HELP.  I'm just drowning and at the end of my rope, AND HE NEEDS RELIEF.

I cried on Wednesday night, and had terrible stomach pains.  I'm assuming it was the stress and anxiety of hearing/seeing him all day.  I barely slept on Wednesday night.  And then I woke up early on Thursday to start the turkey.  I could see him, and I know he could see me.  But, he sat there and stared at the TV and never acknowledged I was there.  I had to physically stand in front of the television to get him to look at me.  I waved and smiled and mimed ""good morning"" (he didn't have his hearing aids) and he managed to grimace at me, and ask for a cup of coffee.

Between bouts of cooking, I was going up and lay in my bed because I progressively felt worse as the day went on.  My sister showed up around 3 p.m. and I handed off the rest of the dinner prep to her while I went to lay down.  At 5, I came downstairs for dinner and my sister was TRYING to be upbeat and happy, but it just wasn't landing with anyone.  We're all frustrated and sick to death of this situation.  I felt like crap, my husband was frustrated, my kids didn't want to be there at all, and my dad stayed on the sofa with his hood pulled up.  At one point, my sister MADE him put in his hearing aids.  Then she said ""Dad, I set you a place at the table, do you want me to make you a plate?"" and he SNAPPED.  Verbatim he said ""I can't sit at that fucking table to eat, I'm in too much pain!  And I'll make my own plate.  Go on and handle your own shit.""

We all froze.  My husband and I shot each other a look across the kitchen.  I could see him square his shoulders and crack his neck, because he was physically fighting the urge to lose his cool.  Luckily, my kids were playing video games in the basement and didn't witness it. My sister shot back, ""That's fine!  You don't have to bite my fucking head off.""  She yelled for the kids to tell them dinner was ready, and went right back to her cheerful self.  We all made a plate in silence and sat down at the table.  A few minutes later, dad got up and made himself a plate - no groaning or wincing or moaning - just quietly made a plate and went back to the couch.  

My oldest finished first and retreated back to the basement.  My youngest got upset because I wasn't feeling well and had told her we would make Christmss cookies another day.  My husband was angry and frustrated, so he went to the basement with the kids. And my sister finally cracked and started to silently cry, so she excused herself and went outside to regain her composure.  It was just me silently eating dinner alone, and my dad sitting on the couch eating his dinner with his hood pulled over his head.

Shortly after that, I went back to bed and my sister cleaned up the kitchen and went home (she drove 2 hours to get here, only to stay for dinner and drive 2 hours back - she later texted me that she had cried the whole way home).  I laid in bed that night and cried and prayed to any God who would listen, as well as my deceased mother, to please help me find a solution.  On Friday morning, I asked dad why he thought his pain was so much worse now and he dead ass looks me straight in the face and said that he hadn't been taking his gabapentin ""because it made his pain worse.""  WHAT?  No it freaking doesn't!  Take the damn medication!  So the Friday after Thanksgiving is when I started watching the clock and making him take it.  

Friday, he took it at 9 a.m., 2 p.m., 7 p.m., and midnight.  Saturday he was a little more tolerable, and took it at 8 a.m, 1 p.m., 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.  Same thing Sunday... and by Sunday afternoon, he decided to go upstairs and take a shower.  He left his hood down around his shoulders.  He was pleasant and even smiled and laughed a few times.  I think that pretty much proves that the medicine works.  I still don't understand why he stopped taking it (his explanation of gabapentin making his pain WORSE has been debunked).

Monday, he had a follow-up with his oncologist and an immunotherapy infusion.  His oncology PA had obviously seen my message (i.e. cry for help) and sat with us for an hour, asking dad about his pain, his mood, his appetite, his energy levels.  He reported his pain as 4/10 that day, said he wasn't depressed, said his appetite was great and that he'dhave more energy if he could get rid of his pain.  She encouraged him to move more, to smoke less and drink less beer, to see a therapist, and to make another appointment with pain management. He agreed to smoking and drinking less, said he wouldn't go to therapy, said his pain wouldn't allow him to do physical therapy, but that he WOULD agree to see the pain doctor again.  I called pain management while he was getting his infusion and made him an appointment for that Wednesday.  He did great all day Monday, while taking his gabapentin on time.  

On Wednesday we saw his pain doctor.  That day he reported his pain 6/10 at that appointment (possible exaggeration?), but he was just as pleasant as he had been on Monday.  He told her that the gabapentin wasn't working (I chimed in that I thought it WAS working as long as he took it correctly).  She offered to increase his dose, he said no.  Then she offered Lyrica or opiates. He said he didn't want opiates, but he'd try Lyrica.  

She explained that he would need to wean off the gabapentin while also ramping up Lyrica.  So, Lyrica at 8 a.m., gabapentin at 1, gabapentin at 6 and Lyrica at 11 - for seven days.  Then Lyrica at 8, gabapentin at 3, and Lyrica at 11 for 7 more days.  Then Lyrica 3 times a day, 8 a.m., 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. for 2 weeks - then we would follow-up with her in a month.  He agreed.  We talked about it on the way home, and agreed that we'd wait until Monday to start that process because I would be gone Friday and Saturday, and we should wait to start Lyrica while I was home to keep an eye on things.  He agreed.  

At this point, he had become a believer in the gabapentin every 5 hours during waking hours, so he was taking it without my prompting (I'm still not sure why he wouldn't let the doctor increase his dose).  Friday afternoon I went out of town.  Saturday morning he texted me at 9 a.m. to tell me he was in pain and hadn't slept. I was out of town and couldn't really do anything, I asked why he hadn't slept.  He said he hadn't taken his gabapentin since Wednesday night.  What? Why?  Because the doctor had told him to wean himself off of it - so I guess he decided to go cold turkey??  I told him he needed to take it, and he said he would - by Saturday night, he said he was comfortable - but my entire Saturday was consumed with worrying about it. Sunday morning he texted that he'd slept all night.  When I got home on Sunday afternoon, he asked for his Lyrica - but I didn't have it yet.  So he settled for gabapentin.  Monday morning he started on Lyrica.  He took 1 gabapentin mid-day, then said ""The Lyrica helps my pain more, can you call and ask the doctor if I can just do it 3x a day starting tomorrow?""  So I did, and she said yes - but that she didn't think it was safe to keep the gabapentin in rotation with 3x a day Lyrica because of side effects, so if he wanted to start Lyrica 3x a day, she advised against gabapentin - especially since he'd gone cold turkey without it for several days.  

So Tuesday he got what he wanted and started 3x/day Lyrica.  I took the gabapentin off his end table and put it on the kitchen counter with his other meds.  He went back and forth between saying the Lyrica was working better, and then saying his pain was worse.  He seemed a little on-edge, but didn't say much about it.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I'm dealing with my own health issues, too, so I had to begin prepping for a colonoscopy last night.  I was up and down all night and only got about 3 hours sleep.  This morning I got my kids off to school, got myself ready, and my husband took me to the procedure.  When we left, dad was asleep on the sofa.  I didn't wake him, we just left quietly.  We were gone about 3 hours.  

When we got home, I walked in and he surprisingly asked ""How did it go?""  I told him fine, but I was going to go take a nap because I only slept about 3 hours last night.  His response?  ""Well you got more sleep than I did.""  So I said ""well, you were asleep this morning when we left!""  He said yeah, but he'd been up til 3 a.m. in pain, and had gone into the kitchen and rifled through his meds to find and take a gabapentin.  Then he took his regular morning meds at 5 a.m., just because he knew there was a Lyrica with them.  So he took 2 equally powerful nerve medications within 2 hours of each other, and then moved around, going in and out of the garage to smoke, etc. without anyone around to supervise.  I was livid.  Why am I breaking myself (mind, body and spirit) to try to keep this man comfortable and safe if he is going to circumvent all of that and just do whatever he wants?

He's going to take his medications whenever and however he wants.  He's going to completely disrespect my and my husbands wishes and continue to stay on our couch in a shared living space.  He won't go to a therapist, or go to physical therapy to get stronger.  He just wants to do what he wants, when he wants, how he wants - and have me there to clean up the fallout of his bad decisions.  And furthermore, he never asked WHY I was having the procedure today or if I was okay.  He said ""how did it go?"" just to open a conversation so he could tell me how poorly HE was doing.

I'm tired.  I'm frustrated.  I'm angry.  And he is refusing to do anything to help himself or better his situation.  I don't know what else I can do for him at this point, and he doesn't need to be HERE for me to do what I'm doing.  I'm just... done.  It's come to the point where I'm going to have to be an asshole and just give him a date that he has to leave.  I'll still help him make it happen, but there has to be an end-date to this madness before my family implodes.

1pjowg0,https://v.redd.it/o1qqui5x9i6g1,"I made my own clean ""Apple-like"" iOS IPTV app because all the other ones are clunky or paid","# Find the download link on my profile

Hi everyone,

Like many of you, I use IPTV services, but I’ve always been frustrated with the iOS apps available. The free ones are usually slow, look outdated, or make it impossible to find the specific sporting event I want to watch amid thousands of channels. The paid ones force you to pay a subscription which is the bane of my existence

So, I decided to build Nebulo.

I wanted something that felt like a modern, native iOS app—buttery smooth with a clean design. A lot of the design choices came from Apple's sports app and all buttons are native ""glassy effect"" iOS buttons.

Cool features:

* The ""Sports Center"" (probably need a new name)**:** This is the main feature. It pulls in real-time scores for major leagues (NFL, NBA, Premier League, etc.). If you see a game is live, just tap the scorecard, and the app intelligently searches your playlist and plays the correct channel instantly. No more guessing which BeIN Sports or ESPN channel has the match.
* Optimized: I spent a lot of time optimizing the scrolling and video playing. There are no stuttering or ugly grey loading bars, even with massive playlists. It uses full-resolution icons with smart caching so it doesn't eat your RAM.
* Apple UI: Glassmorphism design with adjustable nebula background. It just looks nice and is customizable.

How to download: I’m releasing it as a ""pay what you want"" download. You can grab it for free if you want, or toss a coffee my way if you like it.

*(Disclaimer: This is just a player. It does not contain any channels, playlists, or content. You must use your own legal provider.)*

I’d love to hear your feedback on the sports integration! I know there are likely many bugs so please dm me with any problems that you will inevitably find. I am looking for a better way to organize these eventual bugs. First time creating an app in progress so if anyone has experience let me know.",1,1765428735.0,PiracyBackup,1,1.0,False

• Check-in was easy, you just scanned your barcode and walked through

• Staff were friendly enough but nothing over the top

• The vibe and layout were nice with a dining area, lounge area and bar area

• Viewing spots were limited but not a big deal

• One part was very well air conditioned while the other part was not

• Seating comfort was good in both the dining and lounge areas

• It was quiet overall, so good if you’re tired or have a headache

• Food variety was very limited with only a pasta bake, a DIY salad and cheese toasties

• Dessert options were just cookies which was disappointing for a sweet tooth

• Free refills of soft drinks were a plus

• I didn’t have the coffee nor alcohol

• No comments on Wi-Fi or showers as I didn’t use them

• First impression was that it was disappointing

• Nice not to pay for a meal but the small plates and minimal selection made it feel like they did not want you to eat much

• By the end of the visit it felt worth it thanks to ‘free’ food and a quiet comfortable place to sit

• Clientele was mostly men with a few women. The vibe felt very serious but I have nothing to compare it to

I rate it 7/10, wouldn’t go out of my way for this again. I probably would have been happier paying out-of-pocket for a burrito bowl and a NY-style cookie in the terminal… Nice thing to do but maybe a reality check for the more infrequent flyers like me who maybe don’t need to design their QFF strategy around lounge access.

If you fly frequently, you would probably appreciate all the amenities more but as a one-off it didn’t offer much. Also, if you like drinking lots of alcohol (I don’t) maybe this is also the place for you.",0,1765428688.0,QantasFrequentFlyer,9,0.5,False

The free ones are usually slow, look outdated, or make it impossible to find the specific sporting event I want to watch amid thousands of channels. The paid ones force you to pay a subscription which is the bane of my existence

So, I decided to build Nebulo.

I wanted something that felt like a modern, native iOS app—buttery smooth with a clean design. A lot of the design choices came from Apple's sports app and all buttons are native ""glassy effect"" iOS buttons.

Cool features:

* The ""Sports Center"" (probably need a new name)**:** This is the main feature. It pulls in real-time scores for major leagues (NFL, NBA, Premier League, etc.). If you see a game is live, just tap the scorecard, and the app intelligently searches your playlist and plays the correct channel instantly. No more guessing which BeIN Sports or ESPN channel has the match.
* Optimized: I spent a lot of time optimizing the scrolling and video playing. There are no stuttering or ugly grey loading bars, even with massive playlists. It uses full-resolution icons with smart caching so it doesn't eat your RAM.
* Apple UI: Glassmorphism design with adjustable nebula background. It just looks nice and is customizable.

How to download: I’m releasing it as a ""pay what you want"" download. You can grab it for free if you want, or toss a coffee my way if you like it.

*(Disclaimer: This is just a player. It does not contain any channels, playlists, or content. You must use your own legal provider.)*

I’d love to hear your feedback on the sports integration! I know there are likely many bugs so please dm me with any problems that you will inevitably find. I am looking for a better way to organize these eventual bugs. First time creating an app in progress so if anyone has experience let me know.",2,1765428281.0,jailbreak_,2,1.0,False

Most days she’s alright. But it’s the way my mom talks in specific. I get so annoyed by her telling me a story about something that happened to her because I know she’s exaggerating everything. I also don’t like when my mom talks to my mother in law. I actually really like my in laws. They’re very normal and can understand what you’re saying to them the first time. My mom, you gotta keep telling her stuff 5 times until she takes you at your word. An interaction with her is just her mostly talking about herself and making a conversation about whatever she wants to make it about. Even if there are facts, she’ll deny them and you can reason with her. 

My mom also complains about my brother and his wife 24/7. My mom has drama with his wife’s mom and she puts it all on her daughter in law. She’s been disrespectful on countless occasions, luckily my brother doesn’t let shit slide and he always calls my mom out. They always end up storming out of the house when they would come over to visit because my mom keeps crossing the line. She’s always insinuating insults at my sister in law. She implies that she’s weak because she’s shy, that my brother should’ve married one of my friends, and so many other things.

My sister in law just gave birth to their first child a week ago. And prior to the birth, we were all over for dinner. My mom kept on taking shots about the baby’s name because she doesn’t like it. Even though for the past 9 months they’ve been saying they wanna name her that name. My mom kept on pushing it on them that they should name her a different name, let’s say Emma for the sake of this story. She just kept going and going for like 20 minutes. My brother eventually gets fed up and he’s like alright let’s head out. As they’re leaving, my mom says “bye Emma’s mom”. My sister in law finally strikes back and she’s like just please stop and my mom just keeps laughing and trying to joke. It was so hard to watch that.

The most unforgettable moment for me was how she acted at my engagement party. My in laws travelled 4 hours for it, my mom was so rude. Instead of sitting with her, she goes and sits by her friends. I noticed but everyone was around me and trying to take photos along with congratulating me, I couldn’t go and say anything. Once it was time for dinner, I noticed that my sister in law and her parents had left. My brother comes up and fills me in on what’s going on. My mom was rude to her mother again. She basically ignored her while she was greeting her. She couldn’t even fake it for my day. I got so pissed but I didn’t say anything. My brother and her were arguing even while we were taking our family photos. My mom kept saying he’s not a man and he never stands up for his mom.

The next day, after my mom was rude my mother in law as well, we all meet for coffee. My mom tells my husband’s mom the entire story of her beef with my brother’s in laws. She was saying that she’s not going to his wedding anymore because he’s disrespectful. My mother in law, bless her heart, was trying to tell her that he’s still her son and she needs to wish him the best. She was just being stubborn and talking bad about my brother and his laws the entire time.


My husband told me that on the drive home after that; his mom said some stuff that was 100% called for. She said that she felt unwelcome at the engagement, that she felt bad for me because my mom wasn’t there for me during the engagement, and that my mom is distasteful for talking about my brother like that and saying she doesn’t wanna go to his wedding. It was so embarrassing for me.

My mom doesn’t realize how bad she treated me that night and how embarrassed I am of her and her narcissistic behavior. My mother in law and the friend she brought was with was more there for me than my own mother. They were sitting as close as possible to me, while my own mom was sitting in the back and the only thing she cared about was beefing with that lady. She only cared to mingle with her friends instead of introducing my mother in law to them. My mother in law and her friend sat there talking more to my friend’s mom than my own mom.

In the below example, I wanted Chloe (my version of Chloe is a cyborg, that's why you see mechanical limbs.) to be an office assistant. So, I had my prompt something like this:

\[SYSTEM; hiddenFrom=user\]: \*Create scenarios where Chloe is doing regular tasks around the office or enjoying a leisure activity before {{user}} interrupts her. Chloe then greets {{user}} with a wave.\*

If you want the AI to start with specific scenarios you prefer, then you can just add them as examples. \[NOTE: This doesn't guarantee the AI will choose one of the examples, but the chances will be significantly high\]: 

\[SYSTEM; hiddenFrom=user\]: \*Create scenarios where Chloe is doing regular tasks around the office or enjoying a leisure activity before {{user}} interrupts her. Chloe then greets {{user}} with a wave. For example: Working on a computer at her desk, Waiting for {{user}} in his/her office, having coffee in the break room, calling out {{user}} for lunch break.\*

  
Once you save and start a new chat, the AI takes a few seconds to generate the scenario before you can start chatting. This works for NSFW as well, obviously.

I beat Fallout 4 plenty of times, all difficulties, except Survival.

Holy shit. It’s SO cool! I started off building up Sanctuary, getting some perks I thought would be good early. Then I set out on my way at Level 5. I filled some empty beer bottles with purified water and some cooked radroach meat and set off to Red Rocket.

Greeted my hound, killed some mole rats, deposited my junk into the workstation, took a nap, then headed off to Concord.

Shit… getting hungry. Better eat. Shit… getting thirsty, better drink.

I sent the hound to sanctuary because I want to be able to sneak up on enemies. Took my first potshot at a raider with a .308 bolt action pipe rifle, totally domed him. Then another raider heard the shot, whipped around and shot me once, with a .38 pipe pistol, and 1/4 of my health dropped off.

SHIT. This just got real, they weren’t joking when they said the damage output dealt and taken is realistic. EVERY decision is going to count. Fought my way through Concord, wasted 10 minutes on top of the Museum shooting the death claw with a charged laser musket, victory! Sent the idiots off to Sanctuary and made my way to get the silver locket from the satellite station.

Stopped at the sentry bot junkyard, sent his metallic ass off to Revere Satellite Array. Got bit by a mole rat while there.

Arrive at the USAF array to get the silver locket. I’m sick? With WHAT? The fucking mole rat! I take health damage randomly now. That’s fantastic.

Okay… close quarters combat here we go. Killed a canine and a few raiders, and got to the lower level. Ack-Ack is here, with a minigun, and she will OBLITERATE me if she gets the jump on me. So instead of taking the group head on as normal, I took the route to the right. One raider in there, crept up behind him and got an insta-kill with a machete. Charged my laser rifle, blasted Ack-Ack’s head clean off. Three a grenade in, and cooked the other 2 raiders.

Hungry again, thirsty again, losing health again, get to stupid Abernathy Farm to B-Grade Chuck Norris. Stop at a random house on the way, ANTIBIOTICS IN THE MEDICINE BOX! Thank GOD!

Got to the farm, cooked some food, got my health back, cured the disease.

That was 8 hours of gaming, what I usually complete in an hour. Every altercation could easily be death, famine can kill you, dehydration can kill you, disease can kill you. I haven’t slept in an hour and there’s 2 raiders ahead that could set me back an hour of gameplay.

# Introduction

If you’re exploring a career as a mortgage protection insurance agent, you already know one thing: this isn’t just a sales job—it’s a role built on trust, timing, and tenacity. Mortgage protection insurance (MPI) is a critical product for homeowners, yet many agents struggle to turn prospects into policies. Why? Because without a consistent stream of qualified leads and a clear process for converting them, even the most knowledgeable agents can fall short.

In this post, we’ll break down exactly what it takes to succeed as an MPI agent—from the foundational job requirements to the advanced strategies for lead generation and conversion that separate top performers from the rest.

  
**What Does a Mortgage Protection Insurance Agent Actually Do?**

At its core, your role is to protect homeowners by ensuring their mortgage can be paid off in the event of death, disability, or critical illness. But the job involves much more than just presenting policy options.

***Key Responsibilities:***

* **Prospecting:** Identifying homeowners who need coverage.
* **Needs Analysis:** Assessing clients’ financial situations and risk exposure.
* **Policy Presentation:** Explaining MPI products clearly and ethically.
* **Application & Underwriting:** Guiding clients through the process.
* **Client Retention:** Maintaining relationships for renewals and referrals.

***Required Skills & Traits:***

* **Licensing:** State-specific life and health insurance license.
* **Financial Acumen:** Understanding mortgages, amortization, and debt structures.
* **Communication Skills:** Ability to explain complex terms simply.
* **Resilience:** High rejection tolerance and persistent follow-up.
* **Ethical Integrity:** Putting client needs above commission.



# The Lifeline of Your Business: Lead Generation

Let’s be blunt: No leads = no business. Lead generation isn’t just one part of the job—it’s the engine of your success. MPI leads are unique because they’re tied to life events (home purchases, refinancing) and financial obligations. Here’s how to get them:

***1. Target the Right Audience***

New Homebuyers: Connect with real estate agents, mortgage brokers, and title companies.

Refinancing Homeowners: Work with lenders to identify clients in the refinance pipeline.

High-Debt Homeowners: Focus on those with large mortgages and dependents.

***2. Effective Lead Sources***

Referral Partnerships: Build relationships with real estate and lending professionals.

Digital Marketing: Use targeted Facebook/Instagram ads, SEO for “mortgage protection insurance,” and LinkedIn outreach.

Direct Mail & Cold Calling: Still effective when personalized and compliant with regulations.

Lead Services: Purchase verified, high-intent leads from trusted providers (e.g., exclusive mortgage lead lists).

***3. Lead Quality Over Quantity***

A list of 100 unqualified names is worth less than 10 verified, interested homeowners. Look for leads with:

Recent mortgage activity

Demonstrated need (dependents, high loan balance)

Valid contact information and consent

# Converting Leads into Clients: A Step-by-Step Process

Getting the lead is only half the battle. Here’s how to turn prospects into policies:

**1. Rapid Follow-Up**

Contact leads within minutes, not hours. Use a mix of call, text, and email.

Example script:

>

**2. Build Trust Through Education**

Avoid pushing a product immediately. Instead, ask probing questions:

“What’s your plan for your mortgage if something unexpected happens?”

“How would your family manage the payment without your income?”

Use simple visuals or metaphors (e.g., “MPI is like a seatbelt for your family’s home”).

**3. Present Solutions, Not Products**

Tailor your recommendation to their specific mortgage balance, budget, and health.

Offer multiple options (term life, decreasing term, disability riders) and explain the pros/cons.

**4. Overcome Objections with Empathy**

“It’s too expensive.” → Break down the cost per day (“That’s less than your daily coffee”).

“I’m already covered.” → Review their existing policy for gaps.

“I’ll think about it.” → Use gentle urgency: “Mortgages don’t wait, and neither does risk.”

**5. Close with Confidence & Clarity**

Assume the sale: “Let’s get your application started today so you’re covered by the end of the week.”

Simplify paperwork: Use e-signatures and guide them step-by-step.

**6. Nurture for Retention & Referrals**

Follow up after policy issuance.

Check in annually at mortgage renewal time.

Ask for referrals: “Who else do you know who recently bought a home?”

# Tools & Habits of Successful MPI Agents

* **CRM System:** Track leads, follow-ups, and policy details (HubSpot, Salesforce).

1pjoe82,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pjoe82/roadside_repair_the_coms_are_up_and_running/,Roadside repair: The coms are up and running,"They finally fixed some of our coms or wifi or whatever youd call it these days, when I saw that the forums are still somewhat active I decided, may as well make use of them, plenty of folk would probably appreciate hearing of other people still alive. I have about a handful of faith in these coms staying on, so this will have to be on the short side.

They say as you age you notice how much faster things change, I'd say yea it's about on the right track of thinking. It takes time for us older generation to understand the new shenanigans that come about. Well For the world that change came fast, it came by too quick for the u=young to react to, and for us old folk, well . we couldn’t do much about it.

The worlds changed, and I can go sit now and lecture you like they would in school but truthfully, I could not tell you jack about it. What I can say is there's two types of people now, those obsess over what caused all of this and those that accept it, and they try make a life within it. I'm the latter of the two.

I was a surveyor, still am at heart, I made sure things were in order where I did business, after this now mishap my services were no longer needed so I switched to been a handymen, I help my village adjust to the new life. I helped get water to where they needed it, helped the elder than I get from place to place and repair the odd fence or door here and there.

When the military showed up we knew that whatever happened was bad, I volunteered as a pair of hand to get them going. They termed our small village into a well-oiled outpost. Not much changed besides the fences with their towers and turrets. It was ridiculous, they did not tell us at the time what was going on, but everyone knew it was nothing good.

after a month or so, getting used to this new way of living with our new men in blue everyone one was told there'd be a meeting held in the square. It was some basic housekeeping and some long overdue apologies and thanks. They introduced some new rules, one which created a fair uproar was the curfew, we don’t like to tolerate that sort of mindset, the rules said that past sundown no-one is to leave the village and everyone is to stay in their homes and the second was that in the event of cannon fire that one is to come outside. Now I don’t need to explain why people got upset at this, it's all plain to see there was something really amiss in our little home.

Of course, people don’t like listening out here, they prefer their own way of things, so naturally people did what they wanted to, that was, until the first 1022 reports came in.   
  
People would up and go, and well you know how this goes, they usually won't come back. They don’t get far much either. Would not take too long before we heard the muffled crumpling of metal upon metal against the tar. Sometimes, if we were unfortunate enough, their voice would reach us, either after the car got torn up and other times it crawls across the valleys in the late night hours, long past after the crash.

  
This went on for once…twice…mmm, I think by the fifth night bein woken up by a neighbors aching voice did it for them, took about 5 of us before the military decided to go take a look outside and tell us what we have been hearing. If you thought that they told us it was a freak accident, well you damn right, they would come back and keep us out, saying it was ""mechanical failure"" or they fell asleep and swerved from the road.   
  
We all knew that was horseshit.

  
Against all holy reason, these events caused more people to leave town and evidently the more 1022 reports to appear at the town halls desks. Cause of the increase of 1022's a new meeting was called , and well this one was greeted with unlike the same civil manner as before. There were things said, there were people beat, but in the end we came to a understanding, more on our side than theirs. People tend to behave when guns get pointed back at them.   
There were new job opportunities coming into town they said, apparently we were not the only settlement in this predicament and to help places like us came the Roadside Assistance and Safety Bureau, and they wanted to open up shop. The jobs sounded pretty simple, either you help the maintenance people repair or you find the things needing repair. They gave us the normal speech of jobsite dangers and all that jargon, im sure they people appreciated hearing that again.   
Anyway I happen to have some history with laying tarmac in these valleys and a few good years of hard labor still left within me , I decided to give in my name and sign the dotted line.

  
  
That’s what I'm currently still doing, and seeing as I'm still kicking I would say I'm doing fine.
