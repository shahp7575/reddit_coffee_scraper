This is hosted at the FLOW Coffee ATL pourover pop-up which is in the Tiendita basement of El Ponce at 939 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30306.  A few notes:

1. Please RSVP for numbers here: [https://forms.office.com/r/tVwgHQTTnr](https://forms.office.com/r/tVwgHQTTnr)
2. There's no charge for the cupping, but a business is kindly hosting the tasting.  Consider buying a deliciously dialed-in pourover (e.g. Letty Gesha by Diego Bermudez), latte, bag of coffee beans, food and/or a gift from the Mexican gift store.
3. If you have a Decaf project set from a different roaster you'd like to share with others on Saturday, say so in the comments below.
4. This is before the official YouTube stream on December 15.  The live event isn't as crucial as previous James Hoffmann events, so we think that's OK.  But if you want to save yourself for the Sunday, we understand!
5. If you don't know what a cupping is, James Hoffmann Guest Creator Aramse has a nice 1 minute guide here: [https://youtube.com/shorts/yzdUhvBk0Ys](https://youtube.com/shorts/yzdUhvBk0Ys) James himself has a more in-depth 15 minute guide here: [https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ](https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ)
6. If you know what a cupping is and have your own favorite spoon, bring it along!
7. If you'd like to share/trade a small \~15g bag of an interesting specialty coffee you have, bring it along!
8. There is free parking at the venue. Route 2 of the MARTA bus also goes past the venue.

FINALLY - Many thanks to James Hoffmann, his team, and the roasters worldwide for making this massive decaf coffee tasting possible. This free event is designed to enable more people to take part in it!

A guy that I’ve had class with the past 2 semesters but haven’t been super close with just asked me out to coffee. We didn’t talk much but he asked for my instagram on the last day of class. Ran into each other a week later and he asked for my phone number. We’ve been talking the past few days about our final then tonight he texted me to let me know grades were posted, then we got to talking, & he asked me to coffee. If it was someone I had been close with, I’d assume it was just a friendly thing, but considering we haven’t talked much, it seems more like a date thing? 

We’re the same major but he’s graduating on Monday then moving back home to work. We happen to be from the same hometown though. 

I think he’s really cute and sweet but again, just got out of a long term relationship and not looking to date, especially not someone who’s going to be living 2 hrs away.

Thing is, I didn't lose an ounce according to the scale. TBF, I'm shocked.

For a little background:

I'm 40F, 6ft tall, SW: 220

I'm vegan and have been forever. Started putting on weight a few years ago, and never been able to lose. I've tried everything from prescriptions to HIIT. Nothing works. Labs are normal.

ABOUT MY FAST:

* Full 72-hour fast 
* Water only, (including 2 325ml soda waters, no sugars/added ingredients) 
* No coffee 
* Black tea, 1c per day, absolutely no sweeteners or milk (vegan)

I was hoping fasting would jumpstart things (reg. insulin & blood sugar, reset metabolism, so on) but it doesn't seem to work for me.

I'm at a loss.

The experience of fasting was amazing as a personal challenge (discipline and all that), but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed.

How can I have not lost weight eating absolutely nothing? Has anyone else ever experienced this?

I'm rolling into a 4-day now just because I enjoy the discipline of this. No expectations, but I want to better understand what's happening, so I can maybe tweak fasting to work for me in the future.

I love my Breville Barista Express, but I am over being a home barista, and I want a good cup of coffee. Well we finally pulled the trigger and as a Christmas gift we bought the TK 02. I'm sure this is a silly question but I have to make sure. Do we have to leave the bean Hopper full? The reason I asked is my wife uses decaf and cook use regular beans. For that reason we pre-measure beans and add them to the hopper prior to preparation. So my question is is it still possible or will we have to put beans in the hopper empty out the machine and then add more beans whenever we swap between decaf and regular. Thank you!

But no one wants to hear about it and I understand that. I want to shut up about it but it’s this thing that permeates you to the core, and I find myself changing the subject mid sentence even, just to say something about this disease I have. This happens when I feel any movement in my belly while talking. This may be due to fear - anything I feel down there or hear my gut makes me nervous and afraid that pain is coming, so it overtakes my mind and whatever I was talking about before stops mattering. It has you, your body and mind, you have to think about even if you don’t want to.

SIBO also causes spontaneous bursts of anxiety and anger in me. That’s especially when I need to shut up. 

And when the pain is gone, you’re still constantly reminded of the favorite foods and freedoms you have lost for who knows how long. Maybe forever. That includes healthy food as well which I used to love. I used to love cooking now it’s one of those things. You’d cry if you’ve seen what I must eat to feel OK as a 35yo. So social eating and drinks are pretty hard now. Coffee, Tea, alcohol, sugars, sweets… everything people put in their mouth for some extra effect has become painful to me, or is not recommended if I want to live long.
It’s impossible to sleep sometimes for so many reasons. One of them being the vision of myself in 20 years, in a hospital bed, with medical instruments sticking out from my belly.

How do I live my life without saying too much about my personal struggles with SIBO… how do I shut up when I’m in pain or anticipate pain? ",1,1734061878.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.67,False
1hd3of8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hd3of8/on_the_brink_of_divorce_i_34f_have_been_dealing/,On the Brink of Divorce: I (34F) Have Been Dealing with My Husband's (34M) Criticism and Suspected OCPD,"I'm writing this in a state of desperation, looking for any sort of insight or if anyone can relate to the situation I’m in. I (34F) have been in a relationship with my husband (34M) for a total of 9 years (married for 5) and our relationship is at a breaking point and we’re on the brink of divorce. I’ve recently started to suspect that my husband could have some degree of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), which I recently learned about this from my therapist.

The past year or so has been very rocky with conflicts happening once every few days, sometimes every day. Something about our relationship has always felt somewhat off or unfair to me, but I could never quite put my finger on what it was. My husband is a great person and has qualities of a great partner - very emotionally attuned, loving, caring, and considerate. We had hopeful plans for the future: starting a business and eventually starting a family. However, we haven’t yet been able to pursue those plans because for years we’ve always been fixated on working on another project: our relationship (but particularly me).

For background, I was a recovering alcoholic (still drinking off and on during the first year, but finally quit for good shortly after our 1st anniversary and have been sober ever since). My husband is very particular and detail-oriented. He's particular and critical about other daily life aspects as well, such as making coffee, the way the dishwasher is loaded, and constantly ""optimizing"" various daily processes. Also, he tends to be quite judgmental if people are not doing things or behaving in a way that he views as the “right way.” He often is critical about the way others act, including my family and his own friends and family. He cut off his parents a few years ago and also cut out a couple of friendships because he did not approve of the way they were treating him (some of which I can understand). He’s told me he has felt like he has experienced some “OCD-like” tendencies, but mostly when he was younger and doesn’t feel that way much anymore.

Since we first got together, he’s given me an abundance of feedback/criticism over the years. I knew I had my issues being recently sober, trying to acclimate to my new identity as a non-drinker. I just didn’t realize how many issues I had but became acutely aware according to all the feedback he had given me. Recently, I actually sat down and listed all of the things I could think of that’s he’s given me feedback about and I easily came up with over a hundred distinct items. He’s criticized things as basic as the way I walk, talk, and my facial expressions, the way I do my hair, to the way I express myself and how I interact with others (friends, family, strangers), often saying I’m not assertive enough/too timid, don’t speak enough, share my opinion enough, etc.

To be clear, I know that I have my interpersonal issues and I struggle in intimate relationships as far as displaying enough physical affection, intimacy, and being vulnerable. I realize that I have an insecure/avoidant attachment style which can be problematic and we are definitely mismatched compatibility-wise. He’s told me that I need to learn to speak his love languages, particularly with affection and intimacy. This is something I’ve been trying to learn and get better at over the years, but I struggle greatly, and I believe it’s at least partially because I don’t feel emotionally safe with him. Whenever I try to touch him/show him affection in some way, it is scrutinized and I’m told that I didn’t do it the right way or the way I’m doing it doesn’t resonate with him. He tells me that when I make attempts I come off as too unsure of myself and he finds that completely unappealing. He says I lack expressiveness and that the way I show love is insufficient and doesn't meet his needs, often citing that he doesn’t feel much emotional connection with me. He’s told me I need to be more expressive, more feminine, etc. I’ve made honest attempts to be more of the way he’s seeking, but it is never good enough. There is always some form of criticism or “feedback.” There’ve been instances in which I’ve complimented him and he thanked me for the compliment but said that the way I said it wasn’t expressive enough and didn’t resonate with him at all.

He’s also told me I have a huge problem with communication and that I often under-communicate or communicate in a way that leads to misunderstandings. I’ve improved in this area as well but he is very critical if I make a communication mistake because he’s been “through so much with me.” Over the past year or so, he’s particularly fixated on the way I speak, citing that I’m too monotone or my voice lacks energy and inflections. I’ve actually made great strides in improving this aspect, but he is still extremely critical and impatient if I sound “flat” or “hit a bad note.” He gets so bothered by this he often shuts down and goes silent and then he expects me to validate and comfort him to make him feel better. I often try to do this, but I’m unable to bring him comfort because he says I didn’t say the right things, in the right way, or touch him in the right way while I’m comforting him.

There are often times where I feel like I make “mistakes” that I don’t agree are mistakes so I share my perspective on it but he says that my perception is skewed and that what he is telling me to improve is “objectively right.” My perspective is not heard out because I’m viewed as the “instigator” of all of our issues because I lack “basic/fundamental” things therefore I should yield to him. He tells me he is not interested in my perspective because I’m the one who made an initial mistake. He says he has no patience with me because I’ve deprived him for years of a healthy, emotional, intimate connection, which he desperately needs. I understand that he truly feels this way and that is valid, however, I’ve been questioning for years whether this level and frequency of criticism I receive is warranted. I wonder if it is to this level because he might be viewing things through the lens of OCPD (that is if he has it).

Over the past couple of years, the criticism has been unbearable and I have felt a dramatic shift in my self-esteem and emotional stability. I often feel completely unlovable, like I’m defective (he’s told me that if he would've realized how broken I was he probably wouldn’t have gotten in a relationship with me in the first place). Through the years I feel as though I gave my best effort but with the constant criticism about the way I am and the scrutiny of all of my attempts at meeting his needs, I just can’t continue to carry on in this relationship with the way I feel broken down emotionally. He’s gotten to the point where he is so frustrated he calls me some things that are very damaging and hurtful, often calling me stupid or an idiot if I don’t agree with him because “I can’t understand basic logic.” I’ve tried explaining to him that when he says these things it is just hurting the relationship but he says that it’s inhumane for me to deny him of expressing himself and that it is the “right” thing to do because I’ve caused him so much pain over the years. Recently during an argument, he told me that I’ve been a terrible partner and this relationship has been horrible for him since the beginning.

I honestly feel like I’m leaving so much detail out, but there is so much feedback/criticism that I’ve received that I feel it will be too long to cover. The biggest thing that is making me feel like I can’t go on is that he refuses to see things from my perspective and I am constantly blamed for the demise of the relationship. I’ve tried explaining things to him many times in many ways to try to have him see the role he is playing in contributing negatively to the dynamics, but nothing ever seems to get through and he refuses to take any responsibility. I’m really just looking for some insight from anyone who has possibly experienced something similar because I’ve been so lost for so long. I feel like there is something off with him at times, but then I start to doubt myself and think all of the problems lie with me. I’m doubting myself now even as I’m writing this. Could this be OCPD or are we just in a terribly unhealthy dynamic? We currently aren't speaking to each other after another fight about a perceived ""mistake"" I made. I don't believe it was a mistake, but I validated him while also giving my perspective. That wasn't acceptable to him because ""after all we've been through with my poor communication,"" I should not provide my perspective and should only be apologizing/validating. We argued back and forth for a couple of days, couldn't see eye to eye, and essentially haven't been speaking now for over 2 weeks. I've attempted to extend an olive branch on 2-3 occasions, but was denied and he still refuses to speak to me.

**TL;DR:** I've been in a relationship with my husband for 9 years, and we're on the brink of divorce. I suspect he might have Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), which has made him very critical of me. He's given me constant feedback on everything from my behavior to my communication, making me feel inadequate and insecure. Despite my efforts to improve, he never seems satisfied and refuses to see things from my perspective. His criticism has severely impacted my self-esteem, and I'm questioning whether the issues are due to his potential OCPD or if we're just in an unhealthy dynamic.",1,1734061841.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

1hd3m9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1hd3m9c/what_could_i_do_differently/,What could I do differently? ,"So, I currently live with my father, stepmother, and little brother in their home. It’s a two bed one bath small house. My father and stepmother gave me their room while they sleep in the living room. The living situation isn’t terrible but it also isn’t great either. I mean nothing psychical. Just a lot of other things like controlling and narcism. 

I feel like my life is in limbo, like I’m just floating around or existing. I currently work in a small grocery store. I can’t help but notice the different uniform that me and the chef wear than the rest of the store. I can also see some of the signs. It seems that they don’t exactly want me there but they need me there. They hire a few new people but they don’t seem to stay long. 

My experience is only limited to a factory job and mostly retail. I currently work with food like making meals at my store. don’t exactly hate the job but I don’t really like it either. There are a few coworkers that I don’t really like all that much.  One of them is the chef who I can’t help but hope they’ll find a replacement for. He seems to mess up the food, has an attitude and complains to the customers. 

This one other coworker micromanages, asks me personal questions. like when and what I’m having for lunch, who’s picking me up later, etc.. she can be overbearing at times, she’s been there over 6 years though she’s not the manager. The job is close by the house like walking distance. It also offers some good benefits, but they pay less than $16 an hour. 

I have a learners permit but I don’t have a car or a drivers license. I took the one drivers Ed near me and we practiced for 15 hours. They gave me a certificate for driving 15 hours. My father owns two cars in his name. He can’t exactly reach me he’s in his 70’s and retired. His health isn’t too good, he has bad eyesight and hardly ever drives anymore. My stepmother has a drivers license but doesn’t really want to teach me how to drive. 

I don’t really have any friends or family to teach me. There are other driving schools out in the suburbs but they only seem to offer Saturdays and I work Saturdays. 

I get dropped off at work by my stepmother then she comes back home to take my little brother to school. I spend somewhere 20 to 30 minutes sitting outside work until it’s time to clock in. during lunch I walk to the local coffee shop or I go there after work. After work I’ll wander around to either the gym, coffee shop, or look at books at the small indie book store. 

My stepmother doesn’t really like it when others are in the kitchen. Either when they’re in there or when she’s in there she likes to be alone. She’ll wait for them to come out. The kitchen is small, narrow and the fridge is small too. I’ve been given rides to the store before and she’ll literally cook me a meal the same night or the day after. Like I’d have food in the fridge and she’ll cook the same very few meals. Ride, beans on the stove, and or this chicken soup with foods she finds around the kitchen.  

If I bring food then I’m expected to share. Or I’m asked if I brought some for others. If I put it in the fridge she’ll throw it out in a few hours or so. I’ve been trying to eat, drink water, use the bathroom before I get home. Or at least eat what I want to eat. They like to get fast foods like McDonald’s, Burger King, dollar tree etc..

I often times go out to eat. Either it be sushi, pizza, Spanish food, nothing too expensive just like what’s around me. Or smoothies, and açaí bowls at the gym. when I’m at home I fairly sit around, brush my teeth, scroll on my phone until like it’s time for bed. Then the day basically repeats itself.

The past year has been a whirlwind of work, still adjusting to London, and trying to keep up with life. There’s this constant pressure to be on all the time, to push through even when you’re running on empty. But here’s the truth: we’re not machines. And while the grind might seem glamorous in the moment, burnout is anything but.

The other day, I found myself sitting in a pub here in London (yes, I’m fully leaning into the cozy pub culture). I had this moment where I just stopped scrolling, stopped planning, and just sat there. And you know what? The world kept spinning. That little pause didn’t wreck my to-do list or derail my plans. What it did do was remind me how important it is to breathe, recharge, and reconnect with myself. 

I know we hear this all the time: “Put yourself first,” “Self-care isn’t selfish,” blah blah. But seriously - sometimes you have to actually let those words sink in. It’s not just about bubble baths and face masks (though those help). It’s about giving yourself permission to stop and prioritize you! 

So, next time you’re feeling overwhelmed, take that break. Sip your coffee or a tea. Watch the rain outside. Whatever it is - do it just for you for a change. Because if you don’t, who will?

Let’s normalize pausing without guilt. Your future self will thank you. xoxo ☕🔥",1,1734061168.0,u_SensualGirl_US_UK,0,1.0,False

I responded, “It’s a friendly outing, but to be honest, I am interested in you.”. She left me on read and moved away from me in class, and I was hurt. 

 I decided to move past it though, that was until she started acting strange and oddly mean. She kept telling me that I need to hurry up and get this argument we had in English finished with a demeaning attitude in her voice and her expressions. We eventually had the argument and I came out on top with the better argument, and then she stopped acting rude.

You, someone who's probably also been single for a while and looking for someone. Me, feeling the same way. We could get to know each other, share discords, fall in love with each other there and maybe it leads to something more...intimate? It doesn't *have* to play out that way but the sharing of discords would be nice so that we don't stick to reddit (also, I don't have a phone at the moment). 

Now, a word of warning before getting to know me is that I do have some mental illnesses but I *do* take medication for them. I'm also hooked on a couple different substances but it's nothing big, just mainly coffee and vape with some rockstars and soda thrown in for good measure. Lastly, I like to drink a bit of beer or wine here and there with the very rare getting high off of a cart and edibles.

A few things that are big parts of my life are video games, music, and nerdy movies/shows like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, DC and Marvel but I'm also really into dramas; House M.D., for example. If you're wondering about the games I play, a short list would be Skyrim, Phasmophobia, TF2, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Lights 1 & 2. Also, I mostly listen to rock and metal with bands like System of a Down, Alice in Chains, and Nine Inch Nails

Now, what am I looking for, you may ask? Well, it's pretty simple. Just be kind, caring, open minded and have a decent amount of things in common with this post! As per the title, please be a gamer! I am looking for a gf to play games with, so please have that in common. Oh, and, I would prefer if you were from the US so that I don't have to work around huge time gaps.

Alright, with all that out of the way, if this resonated with you feel free to send me a reddit chat! We can talk it out, see how it goes and, if we're feeling it, we can share discords and go from there!",2,1734060929.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

 It’s not that Alia was *mad* that Greylock woke her more than a year early; she made the right call. Large decisions about the mission need to be made together. That’s the whole point of being co-captains. It's just... Now she had a *year* to be awake on an empty colony ship.



Fighting boredom was a constant battle. Greylock had been outfitted with hundreds of thousand of pieces of media for consumption by the colonists when they arrived and needed things to do in their off time. Serials, movies, games, of all kinds had been available. Not only that, but new shows were being beamed to Greylock en route during coasting and braking. But, Alia could watch only so much media. So she exercised.



Alia was running. A multiple kilometer track already existed, in the path for the carts that ran up and down the ship used. She could run all the way down, and then all the way back up and would have run twenty kilometers. Though, she didn’t do that very often. Most of the time she just ran 2.5 kilometers down and 2.5 kilometers back. 



On the way back up to her cabin there was a sudden change in the thrust direction. She was thrown against the wall, and pinned there. While she was trying to push up against the new thrust, a piercing alarm sounded, painfully loud. In the open ship it echoed and howled, and filled the air with noise. “Greylock! Talk to me!” Alia said, panting. She laid against the wall, which now felt like the floor, face down. With her body pressed against the plates she could hear the change in thrust. It was harsher, more ragged… and coming from the side of the ship. The chems! The two-step rockets were firing.



At the speeds they were traveling, Greylock couldn’t dodge anything in their way. Interstellar space was *supposed* to be empty enough that there wouldn’t *be* anything in their way. Humans being humans though, they wondered how to dodge *just in case.* Thus, the two-step chems. Arranged all along the length of Greylock at regular intervals, were very large one-shot rockets. If Greylock absolutely, positively had to get out of the way of something, the two-step chems would fire and push the ship to the side. It took a lot of thrust to do it, and it didn’t move very far, but it was decided that it would be enough. 



The crushing weight of the thrust caused Alia to hear her blood in her ears. The whooshing almost drowned out the acceleration alarm. After thirty seconds or so though, the acceleration ceased, and Alia was able to stand back up. “Greylock! What happened?” She said.



“Sorry Alia, I detected something in our path a few hundred thousand kilometers away. The two-step chems fired automatically, I couldn’t warn you in time.”



“No, it was the right call, I’m all right.” Alia rolled her head on her neck muscles to stretch them, and started walking back to Command. “Let’s review the video when I get up there.”



Sitting in the chair, she and Greylock looked over the videos. The ship had automatically increased her perception of time to be able to have enough time to come to a decision. The time from detection to dodging was less than a minute. Things happen fast when you’re moving at half the speed of light. As they both watched the ventral camera - now at the front because they were decelerating - they saw the drive flame flare a few times before the two-steps fired. “What was that Greylock?”



“Mines I think. Someone planted mines in our path.” Greylock sounded incredulous. “The drive flame took care of them easily, I don’t even think I got a reading. I only noticed now while looking at the video.”



“That doesn’t explain why the two-steps fired though, keep the video going.” Alia said, taking a sip of some coffee she had made earlier. She had meant to have it on ice after her run, but she was just drinking it at room temperature now. The caffeine was more important than the taste. They continued to watch the video. Greylock had slowed it down nearly as much as they could and - there! “Look! There it is!” 



At the edge of the resolution range of the camera was… something. It was huge and nearly black - that was what caused Alia to see it - it was too dark against the deep interstellar blue. It was angular and boxy and as they watched it came closer and closer, there was a flare of white off the port side as the two-steps fired, and then almost too late to dodge, it… disappeared. 



“What the…” Alia said. “What the hell was that?”



“I think it was a ship, Alia. Maybe that’s what those Nullships look like? It sure was… pointy.”



Alia had rolled the video back and was watching it again. If it hadn’t done its disappearing act, they would have struck it. She didn’t know how much damage a Nullship that was stationary relative to Greylock would have caused, but there would have been a tremendous transfer of energy regardless. “It disappeared right before we were going to hit it.” She said. “I wonder if it was trying to do something, like view us, or scan us.”



“Or contact us maybe? Hold please.” Alia continued to watch the video as she finished her coffee. After the Nullship disappeared, the two-step rockets quit. She and Greylock would have to decide if they’d print more out of their limited amount of printable matter. After a few minutes Greylock game back. “We were bathed in some kind of radio emissions, but I don’t think they were trying to talk. It was more likely some kind of scan. Maybe they wanted to verify that we were Greylock, or something else. They had no way of knowing.



“What if they do it again?” 



Greylock audibly sighed. “I don’t know Alia, this is all new to me too. We still have the starboard, dorsal, and ventral rockets. They can do this to us three more times before we have to make a decision. I really hope they learned what they needed to and won’t do it again.” There was a pause, and then “Have you given any thought to why they want you specifically?” Greylock said, carefully.



“I don’t know. I don’t think I’m that special.” Alia said, flopping back in her seat. Other than being co-captain she really hadn’t done anything unique that she could remember. There was school, then her stint in the Defense Force, and then the call for volunteers, and then the sundering and then the training and then she was….



The Sundering?



“Uh, Greylock?”



“Yes, Alia?”



“I think I… remembered something new just now. What is… or was… a Sundering?”



There was a long pause from Greylock. Longer than Alia thought was necessary, really. “You just remembered that now?” She said.



“Just the word, or rather the action. I remembered it when I was thinking back to how I got here. I remember the call for colonial volunteers back when I was in the DF, then ‘the sundering’ and then training, and that’s when I realized I had no idea what sundering was.”



“Oh. Wow.” Greylock was silent again. “This is going to be tough to explain. Why don’t you start by telling me about the training?”



Alia stared up at the ceiling. It wasn’t necessary, but sometimes she felt like she needed to look somewhere when she was talking with Greylock. “The training? It was mostly classroom based. Lots of lecture, lots of relativistic theory, some leadership classes, things like that.”



“And where did you sit?”



“In the classroom? I sat in the third row, right side, near the door. I remember because it was close to the door so I could get up when I needed to use the bathroom. It wasn’t bad really.”



“What did you think of the professors?”



Alia was starting to sound confused. Why was Greylock asking her about her training, now of all times? “They were fine. We’d have one a month, front loading all the information that was their speciality. I remember Dr Kells, he was a trip! He came and droned on and on about soil. Ph levels, nutrients, what good soil looked like and how to tell. I never knew one person could know that much about dirt!” Alia smiled at the memory.



“Any others?”



“Sure, Major Erii would teach us about Colony Ships. Theory and its application, design, history” Alia was getting more animated. “She used to call on me all the time - I think it was because I was in the front row right in the middle - and would always ask for me to reframe what she had just explained to prove that I was paying attention.”



“Uh, Alia?”



“Yeah Greylock?”



“You just told me you were sitting in the third row, right side. Then you told me you were sitting front and center.”



Alia could feel the adrenaline activate, her organs growing sharp and white hot. Her breath increased, and her heart started to pound. She did sit in the front row in the center. She also sat third row, right side. 



She also sat right in the back so she could goof around.



She also sat left side, buy the windows. She could remember the smell of spring, the wet soil and melting snow.



She also sat in the middle, so she could get a good view of most everyone and try and get a handle on how… she… was taking in… the lessons. 



Alia started to feel dizzy. She stood up quickly and then sat back down heavily, gripping the arms of her chair so tightly that her fingers turned white. 



“Alia! Calm down. You’re all right. You’re here, with me. We’re in space. You made it.” Greylock’s voice was calm, reassuring, but Alia could hear that twinge of panic she had. She was afraid Alia was going to lose it. 



“It wouldn’t have been the first time.” Alia thought to herself. With a start, she realized she was remembering more. “Greylock. How many times was I spit?”



“Alia…”



“*Tell me.”*

  


“…One hundred and thirty three times. Alia.” One hundred and thirty three Alia Maplebrooks. All captains of Colony ships. All with AI co-captains. “I was sundered also Alia. All the ships. It’s you and me.”



“Why?” Was the only thing Alia could say.



“We scored the highest. Highest in retention, highest in mental stability, highest co-working score. They couldn’t get enough volunteers for captaining the colony ships so - with your permission - they duplicated us.”



“Could… that be why the colony needs us? Did-” Alia swallowed “-I die, and they need me to do something to their colony ship?”



“I don’t know Alia.” Greylock’s voice was quiet, far away. “I’m… glad you remembered on your own. I was not looking forward to trying to explain it to you.”



“Why?”



“Would you have believed me?”



Alia opened her mouth to answer, and then shut it again. No, she probably wouldn’t have believed Greylock - at least, not at first. “No, probably not.” She grinned. “Though, I like to believe you would have been able to convince me eventually.” She turned back and looked at the data readout on her chair for a few minutes in silence. Finally, she closed the feed with a snap. “One hundred and thirty three times? And you say I volunteered?”



“Well, they told me you volunteered.” Greylock admitted. 



“Would you have changed your mind about working with me if they said I was ordered to do it?”



Another long silence. “No. I would have still done it.”



They sat in silence, once again, the quiet rumble of the main drive braking the ship the only noise.",14,1734060923.0,HFY,6,0.94,False

Hi, I’m new here can someone please help me 

So i recently have been cheated by my bf recently (I found messages of him with a girl) but i decided to give in a 2 chance but the problem is I’ve been feeling super insecure and controlling.
And today it was very hard because i have my bf location on my iPhone and he knows that. And today he went to the supermarket and then went to the coffee shop and after he went to the coffee shop again and all of the sudden I noticed that he was coming from a small road that it’s  a little bit before the supermarket and he didn’t tell me anything about it. I got super anxious about it and when he arrived home I called him and tried to not think about it but then I panicked because he started talking about his day and  that he went to the supermarket and went to the coffee shop and I panicked because he didn’t mention going any other place. I was afraid of talking to him about it because I’ve been trying to trust him and not question anything and it would show that I didn’t trust him by seeing his location. When I talked about it he said that he went to the supermarket one second time but I said it didn’t make sense because the road that the locations showed me he was going is before the supermarket and the location showed me that he was moving, he was not static and he started saying that it was a bug and that he never went to that road and now I don’t know what to do anymore I want to trust him but the location says other thing. And he starts getting very frustrated and defensive because he says he didn’t went there and that is frustrating when you are saying the truth and the other person doesn’t believe it.
I’m really afraid that he is cheating on me again but this time it’s physically with someone.
He says that he feels like he needs to tell me about everything and that kinda feels like wearing a leash, and I said that I don’t like checking his location either and that I know it’s not healthy neither for me or for him or to the relationship and that I want to stop. And I even said that maybe it was better for me to take of his location from my phone because I’m always checking and he said that he doesn’t mind me having his location on my phone because it was him that gave it to me when we started dating so that I could check sometimes without getting worried and things like that. I want to trust him but it is so hard. It didn’t even pass a moth since I discovered everything. I’m feeling so anxious 
I noticed that sometimes yeah that my find me app from iPhone can bug but I’ve just seen before like getting stuck in a place when you are already in other place and never like this .

What triggered BV for me for the first time was getting a copper IUD installed. Literally the next day I got all the symptoms; itchy vagina, fishy door, pain during sex, green/yellow discharge. It lasted for 6 months. I did multiple rounds of oral antibiotics, as well as the vaginal antibiotic suppositories, to no avail. It would always come back. Every time I had sex, not only was it extremely painful, but the stench was absolutely disgusting and I would get so embarrassed and cry in the bathroom after. 

After getting my IUD removed, I stopped getting really bad infections. HOWEVER, I still had a lingering mild fishy smell, especially after having sex. For instance, my pH would be normal, but every time I had sex the smell would come back. Even when I used condoms. I would shower before and after, and so did my boyfriend. It definitely was not a hygiene issue. 

So I asked my generalist doctor as well as my gyno, and they only prescribed me more antibiotics or said that it was my natural smell (first of all; rude. second of all; it wasn’t.) So it had been almost 2 years since my first BV infection, and I was also struggling with intense acne. In an effort to cure my acne… I healed my vaginal microbiome. Here is exactly how it happened.

- I started by eating a lot of fermented food such as sauerkraut or kimchi. 
- I eventually started the SEED oral probiotics. 
- I started limiting my intake of any processed sugar or gluten. I would barely eat any sugar. 
- I cut out coffee. 
- I would drink green juice on an empty stomach every morning + 2 tbsp of seamoss.
Now, the moment where I really noticed a change is when I started doing these 4 things:
- I started eating 1 clove of raw garlic with my dinner every night.  
- I would also eat broccoli, carrots or cauliflower before meals of lunch and dinner. 
- I consumed 2tbsp of coconut oil daily.
- I took ginger and turmeric shots daily.
- 
It’s really when I added these four things that my vaginal microbiome completely healed. Like even after my period my smell went back to normal. I didn’t want to get too excited so I waited before posting this because I was about to go spend a week with my long-distance boyfriend. Lo and behold: after 5 consecutive days of sex (unprotected and protected) there is no smell! I haven’t experienced this in 2 years.

The Longest Ride

 

Sitting on a bench at the bus station at 4 pm Gonzo Morales sips his coffee and looks around him. An elderly couple hold hands and whisper secrets in each other's ears while sitting across from him. Behind them standing in two rows is a group of school children all wearing the same uniform's the girls in blue jumpers with red neckerchiefs, the boy's wearing blue dress shirts with light brown khakis. Following them are two adult chaperones an older man tall and heavyset with no hair pale skin and a medical bag in hand. The second a small thin woman in her sixties with dark black hair and a sundress that almost touches the floor. The last passenger was a thin girl dressed all in black. Her purple and pink hair was covered by a black Knit Beanie Cap, with black jeans and a short-sleeve shirt to cover the rest of her. Sitting inside the bus station Gonzo looks outside the glass doors. The doors are Stained brown making it hard to see but there was not much to look at outside anyway. As the snow fell harder and harder Gonzo prayed that the bus would arrive before the roads were closed by the snowstorm. Pulling into the station the big green bus with the words locks and key travel service printed on the side. As the young bus driver enters the small brick building his brown skin exposed to the cold with patches of snow on both his arms and hat. Walking up to the dispatcher the bus driver whispers something into his ear. The dispatcher then announces. ""Bus 23 leaving from Wallingford to Grace Haven will be departing in ten minutes."" With everyone now starting to line up, Gonzo stands behind the purple-haired girl. At her oldest she might be fifteen, Too young to be traveling alone and yet not a single parent insight. Without a second thought, Gonzo puts his earbuds in and mounts the bus. Following the driver into his bus, the dispatcher sits in the front row just across from the elderly couple. Pulling out of the station the green bus rolls over the snow and Gonzo rests his eyes for the rest of the afternoon. The bus won't arrive in Grace Haven until 2 am so most of the passengers listen to music, watch movies on their phones or like Gonzo just sleep. All but one passenger that is The purple and pink-haired girl. she sits alone in the back of the bus, trembling and mumbling under her breath. As he feels a hard kicking in the seat behind him Gonzo turns around and sees the young pink-haired girl convulsing. Yelling for the driver to stop Gonzo is pulled back hard as the huge green bus stops suddenly. Standing up and running to the front of the bus Gonzo pulls the driver named Harry Prince to the back to help the sick girl. One of the chaperones a man named Gary Wolf runs to the back with his medical bag. By the time they reach the girl she tries to stand. After a quick check-up by Gary who was a registered nurse, the young lady who calls herself clover tells the driver that she is epileptic and sometimes has Seizures. After a few minutes, everyone on the bus is quite and the driver starts the bus up again. Looking out the window Gonzo sees a very unusual sight all the trees once snow-covered are now black and burned. The road itself looked charred and cracked as chunks of the road are missing and potholes fill the streets. The driver must also have seen the road as he stops the bus and makes an announcement. ""Attention passengers we will be delayed just a few hours while I radio the dispatcher in Grace Haven."" Looking around at the driver makes another announcement. ""Will, Gary Wolf, and Gonzo Morales join me at the front of the bus everyone else please stay back."" said the driver. With that, all the passengers move back two rows and Gonzo and Gary move to the front of the bus along with the dispatcher. The four stand together and see black ash falling from the sky through the driver's side window. It's not until the driver points to a half-clawed sign filthy with soot and shit that Gonzo dismounts the bus and wipes down the sign with the driver's hand towel. The sign reads welcome to Grace Haven. As he is wiping down the sign a loud roar shakes the trees and sends Gonzo running back to the bus. The driver shuts the door once Gonzo mounts the bus and all the passengers begin questioning him once Gonzo takes his seat. ""I have no idea what that sound was I didn't see anything,"" said Gonzo in response to the many people all asking the same question. After a few minutes, the driver tries to restore order to the screaming and frightened passengers. Turning the key to start the bus, the driver makes another announcement ""Attention passengers we will be heading into the town of Grace Haven now and arriving at the station in half an hour, SO BE QUIET AND PATIENT thank you."" After his announcement, the driver slowly drives forward inch by inch. The town itself is nothing like Harry, the driver remembers it. As the ash continues falling from the sky onto the ground the frightened people on the bus look around and see building after building covered in graffiti with all their windows smashed. The bus pulls over as the driver opens the door for a child covered head to toe in soot with a blanket wrapped around her for warmth. The driver has her sit next to the dispatcher and warns the rest of the passengers not to step forward and crowd the young lady. The girl herself will not so much as say a word; keeping her head down and holding something in her hand that she nibbles at from time to time. After an hour and a half of driving the bus driver must pull into the station dismounting the bus with his flashlight the driver. ""I'll be back folks just wait here."" he said. As the driver enters the building it starts to snow. The snow falls heavily, inside the building the driver finds the no one. A large straw nest sits on the floor. As he makes his way around the darkened bus station Harry is disgusted by the sight and the smell of the bus station. Seeing the walls covered in vines makes Harry wonder how long the bus station has been abandoned. Walking back to the bus Harry slips on something and uses his flashlight to see what it is. Touching his leg is the bloody carcass of a dead deer as the blood runs down his leg Harry gets up and runs out of the building. Mounting the bus in a hurry the driver shuts the door and tells everyone to be quiet. As Gonzo makes his way to the front of the bus past the shaken little girl he asks the driver what happened. The driver who has a frightened look on his face turns to Gonzo and says. ""It was empty there were nothing and no-one in there."" Looking out the window the dispatcher points to something in the snow. ""What is that."" He says. Looking out the window everyone on the bus sees a huge buck being taken down by strange little black creatures with spiked hair and green eyes. As everyone begins to question what it is they're looking at the creatures and turn their attention to the bus. As the creatures bear down on them Gonzo orders the bus driver to move the bus. Starting the bus the driver peels out of the bus station and floors it straight to the police department. However, all over the streets, the hairy little creatures are everywhere. The streets are littered with the bones of children and as they ride through the streets everyone is appalled by the bloodshed and death they see. These monsters seem to want nothing more than to eat everything and everyone they come across. While the bus moves through the town a loud pop stops the bus in its tracks with the police station still two blocks away the driver tries with all his might to force the bus to move. Before he opens the door, the driver asks everyone if they have any weapons' but no one has anything like a weapon on the bus. Gathering together everyone on the bus gets ready to run. Agreeing that the children should be protected the group produces a plan. A few of the adults will leave the bus and head to the police station Gonzo and the dispatcher both volunteers so does nurse Gary. As the three leave the bus and run down the street the bus driver honks his horn to distract the little monsters. With the creatures distracted the three men run off the bus and head up the street. All around them the men see chaos walking through the snow is difficult, but the group makes it to the police station in ten minutes. Inside the police station, Gonzo finds a police baton on the ground and he picks it up. Littering the ground are bones and skulls, Gary enters a dusty room to look for anything useful. Finding an old radio playing the same massage over and over again, Gary takes a seat and tries to make contact with anyone out there. The dispatcher and Gonzo find the police gun locker. Looking into the locker they find shotguns and handguns with ammo. Packing the guns into a duffle bag Gonzo and the dispatcher look for Gary. Who has someone on the other end of the radio? ""My name is Gary Wolf I'm a nurse from Hyattsville, Maryland, hello is anyone out there?"" he said. As a faint voice comes over the radio Gonzo and the dispatcher arrives. Pulling Gary out of his chair the two men lead him out of the station. Outside the snow starts falling harder and Gonzo sees the bus and it’s surrounded by the little cat-like creatures, taking out a gun from the duffle bag Gonzo takes aim at one of the monsters and fires hitting it in the arm scattering the rest of the monsters. As they mount the bus Gary, and the dispatcher tell the driver about the radio while Gonzo shows him the guns. The driver produces a plan. ""If you guys will stand guard over me out there, I might be able to fix the bus."" said the driver. With Gary, the dispatcher and Gonzo looking out for him the driver begins fixing the bus. Within an hour the bus is in working order and the group mounts the bus. Heading back to Wallingford the bus moves at top speed. Without slowing down for anything the bus continues on its way back home and hopes everything will go back to normal. As Gonzo takes his seat he notices Clover curled up in her seat holding something in her hand. ""Hey, you want some company?"" asked Gonzo. Taking the seat next to Clover, Gonzo offers her something to eat. ""You hungry kid?"" He asked. Taking his half a donut and stuffing her face Clover relaxes a bit and enjoys the ride. The two talk about where Clovers is from and how she got on the bus. From what he can learn Clover is a runaway, her stepfather is an abusive drunk and her mother ran off and left her with her stepdad. After their long talk, the two share a look and Clover falls asleep on his arm. The driver pulls into the Wallingford station and everyone wakes up, the bus station looks normal just like it did when they left. So, dismounting the bus everyone heads back to the bus terminal. Once inside everyone takes a seat and waits for any information about what to do next. Waiting for more than an hour, Gonzo gets up and looks for the bus driver. Heading over to the dispatcher Gonzo knocks on his window and asks. ""Have you seen Harry at all I need to ask him something."" He said. The dispatcher pointed to a back room and unlocked the door with a button. Walking back into the dimly lit room Gonzo finds the bus driver curled up into a ball, walking into the room behind him is the dispatcher. ""He's been like this since we got back, I've tried radioing for help but it’s useless. There is no one out there."" said the dispatcher. As the two stand there talking the T.V. turns on and a news report can be heard. ""It has been ten days since children started to disappear and the sightings of strange black panthers all over Grace Haven. With all this poor news it is easy to forget that the 2014 election is just around the corner."" after the news reports the T.V. shuts off. ""What the hell the 2014 election how old is that broadcast."" said Gonzo. The door opens wide and Clover walks in, she tells Gonzo and the dispatcher that someone is at the door. Running back to the front door Gonzo and the dispatcher see Gary opening the door for a young boy. The child is covered from head to toe in mud and walks in holding something in his hand. Entering the room the mud-covered boy sits next to the little girl and offers her his free hand. The older woman named Amy takes the boy by the hand and tells Gary to get him cleaned up, Gonzo agrees to help and the two look for a place to wash him off. With the dispatcher still trying to radio anyone for help, the group of people trapped in the bus station wonder if anyone is coming to help them. Two of the children Mindy and Greg use all the confusion to look around the bus station. Finding an open-door Mindy leads Greg into the bus garage there sitting undisturbed are three buses with blood smeared on their sides. A low roar fills the kids’ ears as one of the creature’s pounces on Greg dragging him under one of the buses. Mindy leaves the garage and runs back to Gary. After washing the boy off in the sink Gary and Gonzo bring him back to Amy who sits him next to the girl. As Mindy races back to Gary, she tells him about Greg. Gonzo and Gary each get a gun and head into the garage. Looking around the two men spot the dead body of Gray but find no sign of the monster. They do, however, find a huge hole leading outside. The hole was covered in some kind of slime using a stick to poke at the slime Gonzo finds it acidic. As he looks through the hole Gonzo sees something in the snow. He and Gray head outside to see what it is. Finding a woman in the snow with four fingers missing Gonzo and Gary head back inside. After sharing with the rest of the group what they found, Amy begins to notice a change in the children who huddle together in fear. Amy who starts to wonder about the two kids Forces them to open their hands. Inside their hands, she finds two fingers in each hand and screams in horror. While Gary and Gonzo race towards her the two children run to the garage and Gonzo follows them. The two-run through the huge hole and escaped from the bus station. Before Gonzo can follow them, he loses them in the snowstorm. Running to warn the others about the missing children Gonzo is stopped by the dispatcher who tells him he has someone on the radio. ""Hurry you have to hear this message I think it's a warning about where to go in case of an emergency."" said the dispatcher ""Hello this is Eric Stone, I'm a dispatcher for the lock and key travel service and if anyone's out there we're trapped at the bus station please help us!!!"" He said. A faint voice comes over the radio and tells the group about a safe haven two miles away. ""Look for the cabin in the woods I’ll be waiting for you there,"" said the voice. Gathering everyone together Eric the dispatcher and Gonzo tell them about the message they received. While talking about the message the driver arrives and tells them he knows where the cabin is.

""I grew up around here and I know where that cabin is,"" said Harry. Heading back to the radio dispatcher Eric sent a message out to anyone listening out there.

""Hello, anyone out there This is Eric Stone once again reaching out to anyone who will listen!!!"" outside the bus station standing in the snow with a radio is a man dressed against the cold. All around the man are the panther-like creatures with a wave of his hand they attack the bus station. Crashing headfirst into the glass doors, cracking the glass and sending everyone inside running to one of the back rooms. With the children crying and the adults wondering how they are going to escape from this situation, everyone is on edge. As everyone hustles to get out of the bus station Gonzo heads to the garage in hopes of finding a bus that works. Following close behind him is Clover, as the two run to the garage, they find it full of panther monsters. Shutting the door to keep them from getting out of the garage. Heading to the men's room Gonzo and Clover try climbing out the window. Meanwhile in the back office as the last of the kids is through the window Gary and Amy climb out the window after the kids. As they reach the outside the cold air is bracing, however it's not long before one of the children needs help. ""What is it Mindy is your shoe untied,"" said Gary. However, it’s Amy who shows him what's actually wrong. Looking up Gary sees himself and the children surrounded by monsters, as he locks eyes with the man who controls the beasts Gary asks him. ""Why are you doing this?"" Looking him straight in the eye the man says. ""My children need food; they get hungry too."" With that, the man raises his hand and unleashes his terrible creatures on the children. Hearing the screams of the children outside the bus driver and dispatcher raced to the bathroom and climb out the window. The two turn to see the bus station begin overtaken by the panther monsters as the strange man dances in the snow. Catching up to Gonzo and Clover, Harry and Eric tell the two of them what happened to the others. Gonzo cannot believe they are all gone, knowing they do not have much time to mourn the dead, the group continues to run in hopes of finding the cabin. As they move past a group of trees Harry and Eric stop inside the clearing past the trees. They see a woman surrounded by panther monsters, ""hang on miss we're coming for you."" said Harry entering the clearing and grabbing the hand of the strange woman. The naked woman turns into a panther monster and bites Harry in the neck while the rest of her children attack Eric standing up on two legs the panthers pull Eric's arms and legs off as he slowly dies. Seeing a bright light Gonzo and Clover head in that direction seeing a cabin Gonzo and Clover head straight for it. Entering just as the panthers are about to reach them the two shut the door behind themselves. Sitting in a chair is a man with a purple stovepipe hat and purple suit, he sits by the fire and points to Clover. ""Hello dear, it's me, your beloved Uncle Papi. I see you brought some friends with you how wonderful; the panther men were quite hungry…so the more the merrier!"" said Uncle Papi. Gonzo turns to face Clover and asks her ""What is he talking about do you know him?"" he asked. Clover looks down and tells him.

""I met Uncle Papi last month he said he'd help me escape from my family, I just thought he was some weirdo with money. I didn't know what he was going to do to us I swear."" With tears in her eyes, Clover hugs Gonzo and holds him tightly. ""Well as sweet as this all is I must be going, but before I go I must ring the dinner bell."" said Uncle Papi rising his hands and ringing a loud bell. As he disappears in a puff of smoke the doors begin to give way, and Clover holds Gonzo as tight as possible before shutting her eyes.

So I was working full time this year, barely eating and wasn’t being forced as I live in my own seperate apartment downstairs from my moms house. So I was working full time no ac in a hot (36 degrees) town and basically cut out all carbs on my diet and would go through around 3-6 iced black coffees a day as well as low cal and carb salsas and pappadums or any other safe food to keep my energy through the day even just a single container of light cheese and crackers. 
I had to quit my job in October due to the unfair treatment and disrespect I was receiving from others there, but HELP ME I honestly feel like I’ve put back on everything I’ve lost, before I quit my long distance bf came to move in with me, being the first time we met his first impression of me was after I’d lost weight, and now I just feel like I’ve inflated, I’ve told him I feel like this and he seems pretty certain I haven’t gained it all back but I FEEL like I have, on top of that I’m agoraphobic and hate going out so exercise or gym just doesn’t feel like a choice here especially when my place is crowded asf, the towns so small everyone knows each other, and my backyard isn’t even safe because the neighbours sit in the garage to drink and chill and any time me or my mother go out there they go dead silent and watch our every movement 😭😭 

I can’t lie either the bf likes to get take out abit and he really doesn’t like vegetables so clean eating as a couple won’t work (no I will not leave him over this tf)
But I’ve gone from barely having carbs and calories to feeling like I’ve been trapped in a careless mindset and now I’m just thinking of highly restricting myself again 
E.g 
Low cals 
Low carbs
Low sodium
Natural fats (monounsaturated) etc.

No noise. No nonsense. No needless drama.

1hd2rro,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1hd2rro/unicitys_feel_great_system_a_closer_look_scam/,Unicity’s “Feel Great” System: A Closer Look (SCAM),"**TL;DR:** Unicity’s “Feel Great” is basically intermittent fasting plus overpriced supplements (yerba mate and fiber). No magic fat-burning ingredient—just a structured routine and mild appetite suppression.

**Details:**

* **Intermittent Fasting (IF):** The core of the program is IF, a proven method where restricting eating windows often leads to fewer calories consumed. Studies show IF can help with weight management ([PubMed: 32779198](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32779198/)).
* **Unimate:** A yerba mate extract. Yerba mate contains caffeine and theobromine—compounds found in coffee and chocolate—which can provide mild energy and appetite suppression ([PubMed: 25859814](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859814/)). This may help you stick to fasting, but you can buy yerba mate for a fraction of the price.
* **Balance:** A fiber blend with vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts. Fiber is well-known to support fullness and normal blood glucose levels ([PubMed: 30909062](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909062/)). Again, nothing special—many cheaper, high-fiber foods or supplements exist.

**What’s Really Happening?**  
People lose weight mostly because they’re eating less. The supplements might make it a bit easier to handle hunger, but there’s no secret sauce. It’s just standard nutrition science dressed up with a hefty price tag.

**Takeaway:**  
If you find IF hard, a cheap fiber supplement and plain yerba mate tea might give you the same results. Don’t buy into the hype. The “Feel Great” system is basically packaging common dietary strategies into a branded product line.",7,1734058857.0,diet,1,1.0,False

And today it was very hard because i have my bf location on my iPhone and he knows that. And today he went to the supermarket and then went to the coffee shop and after he went to the coffee shop again and all of the sudden I noticed that he was coming from a small road that it’s  a little bit before the supermarket and he didn’t tell me anything about it. I got super anxious about it and when he arrived home I called him and tried to not think about it but then I panicked because he started talking about his day and  that he went to the supermarket and went to the coffee shop and I panicked because he didn’t mention going any other place. I was afraid of talking to him about it because I’ve been trying to trust him and not question anything and it would show that I didn’t trust him by seeing his location. When I talked about it he said that he went to the supermarket one second time but I said it didn’t make sense because the road that the locations showed me he was going is before the supermarket and the location showed me that he was moving, he was not static and he started saying that it was a bug and that he never went to that road and now I don’t know what to do anymore I want to trust him but the location says other thing. And he starts getting very frustrated and defensive because he says he didn’t went there and that is frustrating when you are saying the truth and the other person doesn’t believe it.
I’m really afraid that he is cheating on me again but this time it’s physically with someone.
He says that he feels like he needs to tell me about everything and that kinda feels like wearing a leash, and I said that I don’t like checking his location either and that I know it’s not healthy neither for me or for him or to the relationship and that I want to stop. And I even said that maybe it was better for me to take of his location from my phone because I’m always checking and he said that he doesn’t mind me having his location on my phone because it was him that gave it to me when we started dating so that I could check sometimes without getting worried and things like that. I want to trust him but it is so hard. It didn’t even pass a moth since I discovered everything. I’m feeling so anxious 
Can someone please give me an advice I don’t know what to do ",2,1734058653.0,cheating_stories,3,1.0,False
1hd2p24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1hd2p24/brain_fog_fatigue_insomnia/,"Brain fog, fatigue, insomnia","Is brain fog common among the high-IQ community? Or insomnia, which in turn causes fatigue and brain fog? I have struggled with insomnia for eons. It manifests either as an inability to fall asleep, or an inability to stay asleep, or it manifests itself as waking up far earlier than I'd like. Even when I do get 8-9 hours of sleep, it's sometimes fragmented or non-regenerative. Thus I find myself unable to read as much as I'd like or exploit my intellect as much as I'd like, as I'm always up against the gale headwinds of brain fog and fatigue. This also hampers my social life. I enjoy going out and meeting new and interesting people but I often find myself retreating because I'm too tired (and if I'm too tired, the only way for me to loosen up is by drinking alcohol).

The only things that have given me some measure of relief are melatonin and valerian root, and I've been taking the former for over ten years. I've cut most junk food from my diet, and I drink mostly water and coffee, and occasionally beer. And my coffee intake happens soon after I wake up - rarely do I drink coffee late in the day.

I also experience sensory overload at times, which in turn also short circuits my thinking process. Just the other night I was at that point in the day when my brain fog had kicked in, and I felt overloaded by the bright lights of the floor I was working on. A manager passed out a puzzle for us to solve to make time pass faster, and I said, ""I can't solve that right now because I'm not in the right headset."" LOL (I meant to say ""headspace"" not headset).

Anyway, any tips? Here's what I've tried throughout the years:

* Melatonin (helps somewhat)
* Valerian root (helps somewhat)
* Exercise (double-edged sword; when it helps, it helps wonderfully. Sometimes, however, it kills my sleep)
* L-Theanine (works sometimes when I take it with coffee)
* Meditation (has never worked)
* Eating healthfully (has helped somewhat)
* Consistent sleep schedule (this has helped me fall asleep faster, but has had little impact on my sleep duration)
* White noise (helps somewhat)",3,1734058622.0,Gifted,7,1.0,False
1hd2ou6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hd2ou6/aita_for_spilling_wine_on_my_sisters_dress_during/,AITA for spilling wine on my sisters dress during her wedding?,"Me (F23) and my sister Chloe (F25) have always been really close. We had a great childhood together and made a lot of fun memories together. Her now husband John (M26) proposed to her around February 2024. She was so excited and so was I. We went straight to dress shopping venue picking etc. (with our parents and her bridesmaids.) One day we met up for coffee and she LITERALLY told me to pay for her ENTIRE wedding. (Im pretty well of and very comfortable) I really said "" R u serious..?"" She really said ""Yes I am It would mean the world to me and John."" I felt really bad and did not want to let her down like that so I did. Stupid mistake. I agreed to help her. I paid *for everything that you can imagine venues, dresses, decorations EVERYTHING. Then one day in the bridesmaid group chat she told everyone to meet at her house for some drinks. Everyone got there and then announces her MOH. It was going to be her best friend. I was pretty shocked about the news considering the fact that I was paying for everything. But I stayed slient. Then we had a bachlorette party in Cancun Mexico and it was really fun. That trip is really not important in this story. Fast foward to the day before the wedding we were in the rehearsal. It was in a big ass mansion that our grandparents own. Everything went smooth until Chloe told our parents that she did not want to do the wedding in the mansion. Everyone was shocked by this news and confused. I quietly tell her that shes acting crazy and that the mansion was beautiful and that she should go through with wedding in the mansion. She refused. She shouted at me and said ""Look I dont care about your opinion this is my wedding Marie. This is why you are not my MOH."" Everyone stood silent and the rehersal was cut short. For context* we grew up in a very wealthy family and he have 2 older brothers Mike (M29) and Lionel (M28) They will be important later. Chloe couldnt care less about our grandparents while my brothers and I worshiped the ground they walked on, they are sacred to us. Now its the day of the wedding. The bridesmaids arrive and the MOH arrives. everyone gets the hair and makeup done and everything is going smoothly until Chloe comes storming in. I dont use this word often but she looks FURIOUS. She starts yelling at me because she did not like the flowers I picked out. (Keep in mind they were about 3,000 USD) I stand there but then I clapped back. ""You told me you wanted pink tulips and they look fantastic. How about you be a little more grateful and appreciate what you have."" She literally stood there crossing her arms and then SLAPPED me. I was about to pack up and leave until my mom walked in and stopped me. I explained the situation and she understood but she said after all it was my sisters wedding. So i stayed and then I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Later the bridesmaids walk in and they let me vent to them. (I love them.) Soon the wedding started. The ceremony went on then the boring speeches, everyone starts crying blah blah blah. Here comes the good part. During the reception everyone was there. (200 ppl) I called my brothers and told them my plan to pour the wine on Chloe. They agreed. (They hate her too btw.) I walk over to her and ""Congratulate"" her on the wedding. Then my little nephew Matteo (Son of my brother Lionel.)  runs and pushes me and the glass of wine drips down my sisters dress. (the dress was sooo gorg it hurts to ruin a dress like that.) Everyone looks at me, Chloe and Matteo in shock. Long story short the wedding was cut 2 hours early because Chloe had a temper tantrum. Tbh I only feel bad for John in this. My family and I finally taught Chloe what karma is.

I want to win her back,"Ok, let me preface this by saying this. I got out of a hectic long term relationship about a year ago that I was in for 4 years(one that went on and off and I had to eventually keep hidden from my family due to the toxicity on their part) and I worked heavily on myself before ever meeting this girl. I(M29) just recently went through a breakup with my(29F). Everything seemed perfect. I work nights so I decided to try the dating apps. We met through Hinge in early June(believe me I thought it wasn't gonna work either and just another girl who wanted to go on a few dates) and to my surprise we hit it off immediately. First date Jube 14th was awesome, it felt like meeting an old friend and we kissed by the end of the night(I don't usually do that on a first date). Moving forward we had a shit ton in common. We both love the outdoors, 80s music, camping, camper vans, cars, stupid things like PB sandwiches, honey, and wildlife. We went on a camping trip and stayed at an artistic town at an AirBnb and everything was amazing. Though relatively short(Dated 2.5 months before making things official, then official for 3.5) it was pretty awesome. I felt like I found the one. After the elections happened, I didn't vote(dont trust gov or politics being that I've worked for them 3 diff times) and I think it may have upset her or seen me in a different light. About 2 weeks after, she wanted to meet for coffee. Now, leading up to this day, I do believe that I myself wasn't necessarily being assertive during the entirety of the relationship. In the beginning I would always plan dates and times but as we got used to each other, I laid back a bit and became more of the ""if you'd like to do this, I'm totally down"" kind of person(learned behaviors from past relationships where if I didn't agree, there were problems)... personally, I can understand the political aspect, but I don't understand what else I did wrong. I was very chivalrous, constantly doing old school romantic shit that I was taught by my mother growing up, and this girl was always saying that she wanted someone romantic and do romantic gestures, even though now I think her perception of romance probably stemmed from dark romance books(you know the ones). Leading up to the break up, she wanted to get coffee(I knew I was screwed) and we talked as if normal just catching up on some things to which at one point I ask during a pause ""I feel like there's a negative connotation to this discussion""... she replies hesitantly with a yeah. Afterwards she goes and says that she thinks she's not meeting my expectations as a partner bc work was getting in the way for her. She then proceeds to say that she knows we're both emotionally and physically compatible, but she still feels like there's something missing and she doesnt think we are the people we are going to want years from now for each other. This breaks me bc I saw her as the one. I've experienced heartbreak before, but this was like my heart disintegrated completely. I don't know what happened. Maybe I bored her, or maybe I gave too much of the ""nice"" guy vibes(I hate being called that btw, it's not a term of endearment but rather a jab) or maybe I wasn't stepping up as a man. It's all very confusing to me and I'm tired of the dating scene due to low quality people nowadays. She was the last person I ever wanted to be in my life to conplete the story instead of becoming another chapter. For context, I have been with plenty of other women and dated 5 so I have experience in relationships. I did a lot during this one and put my full foot forward after failing in my past bc I knew this girl was different right off the bat.  Please help. I want to know how to navigate this and win her back but I'm so at a loss. I have been in no contact for about a month, and I want this person back in my life because she's the most amazing woman I have ever met. I told her I respected her decision, but I don't want to settle for less in this world and she's the only one I have eyes for, it's killing me inside.

**Hi everyone, and welcome to the completely revisioned PC Parts Lists guide for the end of 2024 and early 2025!**

All lists have been remade from the ground up, as the market has been shifting and seeing new releases. I want to preface by saying that I will update the lists retroactively when new hardware will be released, such as the upcoming **Intel Arc B580** GPU, the **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** when it gets better stocked/priced, and of course the upcoming Nvidia RTX 5080/5090 when they get announced early January. I say ""I"", but I would like to announce that I've been getting help from frequent contributor of the subreddit: u/justaboss101.

# Before proceeding/commenting, please read the following:

* I have been getting a lot of comments of people being confused what the lists are actually for, and how the parametric selections work on [PCPartpicker.com](http://PCPartpicker.com) . Please use the [flowchart](https://imgur.com/a/LL98lVI) below to guide you through the website before commenting some frequently ask questions

https://preview.redd.it/dv74n5kmmi6e1.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c589dc181154ba9812e82aad468b1989bd90148

* I want to reiterate that these lists are here to give you an indication on what you can **expect** for a certain budget; what kind of **value** you can get for your money with that budget. That does not only mean pure performance, but also features, expandability, and future upgradability. Some of these are hard to quantify in words, but I have tried my best through my own judgment to make some weighted decisions on each list.
   * To give you an example, in the [$1200](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/4r9rmG) list I might recommend a Ryzen 7600(X) with an RTX 4070 Super, 32GB RAM, paired with a 1TB SSD, and a relatively value-oriented case, cooler & motherboard. This is my vision of the best 'value' PC you can get, but if you have a different PC with a high end case with RGB, expensive cooler, and 2TB SSD, that is 100%, utterly and completely, fine! I just want you to have a **reference point**.

Here are some of the major changes in this iteration of the PC Best Buy Guide compared to the [previous version](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/1fkhpn1/autumn_2024_pc_best_buy_guide_300_6000/).

1. I have removed having multiple lists for a single pricepoint. This caused more confusion than clarity.
2. Reduced the budget threshold to where WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity is a requisite.
3. More AMD RX 6000 GPUs have been replaced by RX 7000 successors.
4. Started preferring Nvidia at the high end. With current pricing I think the 4070 Ti Super and 4080 Super offer a better package than the 7900XT and 7900XTX in my opinion. That being said, the 7900XT(X) are still great GPUs. AMD still offers the best value with the 7600, 7600XT, 7700XT, 7800XT, and 7900 GRE.
5. Due to the volatility of the Ryzen 7800X3D and 9800X3D CPU pricing, the 7700X and 9700X will often be used as substitutes in gaming PCs.
6. Due to the RTX 4090 now being almost completely out of stock or ridiculously expensive at $2300+ I've opted to leave out the mega expensive PC parts lists until the RTX 5080/5090 have released, and the 9800X3D has gone down in price.
7. Removed the NZXT themed build and many part selections due to ongoing consumer unfriendly practices.

The three of them caught an omnibus back to Eastern's apartment. Now that they knew that Houndstooth was the one going through their things their places weren’t off limits.

They fell into the apartment and Selkirk took up station on the couch, while Nick used the bathroom and then joined her. 

Once again she put her head on his lap and he started stroking between her ears. Eastern was in the kitchen rummaging in her refrigerator. “The cabinets are dangerously low on provisions, hons. Want takeout?""

Selkirk looked up from Nick's lap. ""I'm starving. I'll eat figuratively anything.""

Nick nodded. ""It's been a day. Let's get something delivered."" 

Eastern brought her pad over to the couch and flopped down, leaning her back against Nick's side. She went through the options of restaurants who will deliver to her place. In a fit of... nostalgia? Nick recommended Parvatian food. Eastern was interested, and the place nearest to them had things Selkirk could eat. When the food arrived, Nick was immediately transported back to his childhood. The smells, the flavors, it all reminded him of being back home and getting takeout with his parents after they had a long day at work and didn’t want to cook. Nick got Parvatian food rarely after moving to Hyacinth. At first, he wanted to cut himself off from his old life and start everything new. Eventually it would just remind him of his parents. Nick wondered if finally enough time has passed that his memories of them were comforting rather than depressing. Maybe the fact that he could share it with friends now helped.

Eastern and Selkirk had never had Parvatian before and while it was all food she could eat, Selkirk declared the spices too unfamiliar and stuck with the naan. Eastern was intrigued though and would try the different combinations that Nick would recommend. 

After dinner, they all sat together on Eastern’s couch in her tiny apartment. Eastern stretched and looked at both of them. “Now that we’ve eaten, we should think about next steps. Do we have any leads at all on Yon?”

Nick shook his head. “I don’t have any. I wouldn’t know the first place to begin looking for a missing AI.”

Selkirk smiled and flicked her ears. “I swear, it’s like you two have never done anything more advanced than boost trinkets before.”

Nick raised an eyebrow. “I mean, I haven’t really. Boost small things, poach some apps or softs from unsecured servers, a bit of light smash and grab.”

Eastern chuckled. “Okay then, Selkirk - kingpin of Hyacinth - what do we do next.”

Selkirk grinned wickedly at them. “The *first* thing we do is go to the bedroom. The second thing we do is have an enjoyable time learning about each other and what their likes in the bedroom are. The third thing we do is have a wild evening exploring those likes. The fourth thing we do is fall asleep in a pile, blissfully spent. The **fifth** thing we do is trust Kingpin Selkirk and she’ll show you the way in the morning.

A few hours later, Nick realized Selkirk was right. She had it all planned out and it went exactly according to plan.

The morning found them sprawled out on Eastern’s bed, naked in a pile. They got up, made coffee and this time Nick recommended just some pastries as they walked.

Eastern ate her pastry in record time, and she tossed the paper into a trash receptacle without even stopping. “Okay Selkirk, other than Nick’s idea for coffee and pastries, we’ve been following your plan and you haven’t lead us wrong yet.” She reached over and - lightning quick - pinched her rear next to her tail. “What’s next?”

Selkirk jumped at the touch and grinned at Eastern. “Next, we’re going to the Basement.”

“The Basement?” Nick could hear Sel pronounce the proper noun. He looked at Selkirk as they were walking. “I didn’t think where were basements on Hyacinth.”

Selkirk winked, her face naturally mimicking the human gesture.. “You just don’t know where to look. Follow me.”

Eastern and Nick followed her as she took them further up-arm. They caught a Metro and rode up to Peony square. This far north, it was mostly commuters going further down-arm towards the more built up areas near the base to their office jobs. Arriving at Peony square station, they follow the light crowds out of the metro car. 

Selkirk held them back on the platform as the morning commute crowds flowed down the stairs towards the the next train. When the crowds were mostly gone, Selkirk dashed towards the rear of the station. With a glance back to make sure that Eastern and Nick were following her, she slapped her palm against a reader that Nick could have sworn wasn’t there earlier and a door slid open. 

“Come on, let’s go, we gotta ghost before the next train comes!” Eastern and Nick ducked through the doorway and it slamed shut behind them.

They were in a hall. It looked like any other maintenance tunnel that Nick had seen in his time on Hyacinth. Selkirk led them confidently down the tunnel until they reach another anonymous door. The only sign that anything was different with this door than any of the dozens of other doors in the hall was a small sticker at K’laxi level. It was a stylized flower - a cartoon of a hyacinth actually. Again she palmed the reader and again the door hissed open. “Come on, couple more levels to go.” Nick and Eastern followed silently.

It’s not like the buildings and streets were sitting on the hull of Hyacinth. If they were, there would be no place for the power lines, the sewer pipes, the water supply; all of the circulation, the veins, neurons and organs of civilization. On planets, it’s under the ground, on stations and starbases it’s usually in the walls or the ceiling. 

On Hyacinth, it’s in The Basement. 

The Basement was what everyone called the maintenance tunnels and access halls below the ground floor. Most of the time, only Houndstooth maintenance techs and city workers were going to be down there. This meant that there would be long stretches of Basement that would go potentially *years* before someone who was supposed to be there would show up.

It was inevitable that someone was going to find and use this otherwise underutilized space.

Hyacinth was big, but it wasn’t so big that people didn’t need a place to hide and do business out of the prying eyes of Houndstooth authorities. After going down another set of stairs, Nick looked around. Now, the walls here were unpainted panels clipped and bolted together and the signs became much more encoded. He’d see things like SECTOR X-45 RIGHT SPINWARD DEP COMP on a dusty label and realized that they were in a part of Hyacinth that was rarely officially seen. Other than people going where Selkirk was taking them, the number of… *official* visitors was probably in the single digits in the last century.

Finally, they reach a door and Selkirk stopped. She looked back at them, her eyes bright. “Look. I trust you, otherwise I wouldn’t be in a relationship with you, and I wouldn’t have taken you here. But, I need to make sure you’re ready to trust me.” Her ears twitched. “Things might get… weird.”

Nick blinked. “Of course I trust you Sel.”

Eastern agreed. “Implicitly.”

Selkirk’s ears twitched again and she smiled. “Thanks. I knew it, but I needed you to say it before we go any further. This part of the Basement has a lot of K’laxi and… you might get a bit of the furry eyeball. Just remember, you’re with me, I trust you, you trust me and if things go sideways, I’ll let you know. Selkirk nodded half to herself once. “Good.”

Eastern and Nick looked at each other for a split second, then back at Selkirk. They were going somewhere that wasn’t theirs, they’d do well to listen to someone that knew more about where they were going. Sel took a breath, held it a moment, and then let it out slowly. She palmed the last door and it hissed open.

Nick’s senses were *assaulted*. It was noisy, it smelled of spices that he had no names for, and of countless people. Eastern grinned widely as she took it all in. “Now this? This feels like home. I like it” Luna was even older than Hyacinth and had always trended towards small, crowded spaces.  Nick, having grown up on Parvati which had plenty of room did *not* like crowded spaces and tried not to wince, then followed Selkirk. 

It was so crowded. They were walking down what was clearly an old, wide hallway, but it had been set up with stalls and booths of people selling things. Food, goods, information. Nick looked around; it seemed like people were selling everything. 

There were more K’laxi here than Nick had ever seen. There were a decent number of K’laxi on Hyacinth but it felt like they were *all* here, right now.

Selkirk was in her element. Immediately after she walks in she starts waving and shouting to people who recognize her and the business of business begins. Eastern and Nick could only watch and follow her as she made her way down the hall, using her tail and her ears and her hands to gesture while she spoke, using a patois that neither of them could even hope to replicate.

 

Before too long, a fried treat on a stick was pressed into Nick’s hand and a hot drink into Eastern’s.  Nick took a bite. It was hot and crispy and fried and delicious. He handed it over to Eastern and she took a big bite too. “This is amazing!” Eastern said around the mouthful of food. “Here Nick, try my drink.” She hands it over to him and he takes a sip. It’s hot and woodsy and probably a kind of tea. He’s never had the specific flavor combination before but it’s nice. It’s a good compliment to the fried treat on a stick.

Selkirk grinned as she continues to work the crowd. “I thought you’d like that. They-“ She gestures with her tail to a stall behind them “-were trying to ingratiate themselves to me and try and wrangle a discount with someone I know.”

Nick took another bite. “Did it work?”

She chuckled. “A bit yeah, but probably not as much as they are hoping.”

Eastern took another sip of the tea. “Did you find out anything?”

She nodded. “Yeah, I have a lead. We’re headed to talk to them now.”

Selkirk led them further down the hall and they came to an intersection. Nick was amazed at how large The Basement really was. “Sel, does The Basement run the length of Hyacinth?”

“Sort of. There are a bunch of *different* Basements all across Hyacinth. If it was all one continuous place it would have been found out and cleared out long ago. As it is, they get raided pretty regularly, especially the ones down-arm. This one is relatively new, so we’re hopeful it’ll be around a while. Come on, it’s this way.” Selkirk looked at the intersection and turned left.

As they walked further into the basement, things got less rowdy and quieter. The shops changed from people selling food and merchandise to what looks to Nick to be like meeting rooms and offices. Some were even behind former mechanical room doors.

After another few turns and they were deep into The Basement. They got to a plain looking door, clearly a repurposed maintenance door. Selkirk walked up to it and made another complicated gesture with her hands, ears and tail and they heard the click of a speaker.

“Yes?”

“Ral said you’d be able to help us with our problem.”

“Did they now?”

“Yes, they also said you can use this to get half off next month’s payment to them.”

After a pause, Nick heard the click of a lock. Selkirk touched the pad next to the door and it hissed open. 

The three of them stepped inside and… it’s an office.

Just an office. Anonymous art on the walls, indirect calm lighting overhead, chairs that look comfortable but aren’t.

An office.

Sitting at a simple metal desk was a woman-shaped person. She seemed older than Nick and Eastern, maybe late 30s or early 40s. She had brown hair in a tight bun tied up with a chopstick, and was reading a pad. She looked up at the three of them. 

“I confirmed with Ral what he’s offering and what they said you need. I’m willing to *listen* but I will make no guarantees about being able to help.” She put down the pad. “My name is - or rather was - *Sunny Day*, but you can call me Sunny.”",9,1734057957.0,HFY,2,0.91,False

No one is making plans except me 🙄,"I have a 2 year old and an almost 3-month old baby. In the past my family went to my parents house for a typical big Christmas Eve celebration. Over the last few years my parents and I have basically parted ways. It’s probably not reconcilable, and definitely not by Christmas. 

My in-laws are..meh. FIL is a typical hyper-masculine man whose family is afraid of him. I’m the only one who has stood up to him (when he was holding onto my son and wouldn’t let him go and my son started to scream.. forcing him to sit in the kiddie pool when he wanted to stand and get out..) and my husband has started to as well. MIL just has a loooot of unsolicited advice and demands her gifts to be used in front of her otherwise she gets mean, it’s stuff like that that I can ignore but it’s exhausting because I feel like I’m parenting my husbands parents. Them and my husbands grandmas are first gen immigrants from Eastern Europe and they all cook 90% of their meals and takeout is basically shocking to them (significant for later). 

None of them have initiated holiday plans and I know they’re going to try and set something up last minute. For thanksgiving I planned to have them over but they went on vacation instead. I’m trying to plan something now for them (husbands parents and 3 grandmas so 7 total including my husband and I). 

They all live 1.5 hours from us and my husband refuses to drive there with our toddler to celebrate the holiday. He says it would be weird to be without me and is worried I’ll get upset that he left me during the holidays (btw we’re talking 12/21 or 1/4). 

I don’t feel up for hosting a meal. I’m 11 weeks postpartum and while I have the house and capacity to do it, I just don’t want to. I’m tired. Baby still wakes up 2-3x/night. I’m just starting to get over severe PPD that almost put me in the hospital less than a month ago.

I offered to my husband to meet his family halfway for a nice restaurant meal at a fancy hotel nearby so we could do a gift exchange in the big lounge area and have dinner together. I sent him a list of 5 options in different cute little towns between us and them. One even had a children’s musical option. He didn’t like any of those. He countered with saying just his parents can meet him at a local arboretum for a walk and meal. Well, it’s winter and about 20-30 degrees out so that’s just not a good idea. Plus, his grandmas wouldn’t go to that and part of the reason for gathering is for them to meet our new baby who is actually named after one of them. 

So finally I said how about they come to our town for brunch, we go back to our house so toddler can nap, during toddlers nap we all watch a Russian Christmas movie (they’re Russian) and when he wakes up we’ll do presents and pizza. We did a pizza party over the summer and the grandmas loved it. But then my husband said well if it’s a holiday celebration they’ll want to bring food. But the idea of 4 older women bringing armfuls of food to my house is too much for me. I’d have to clear my refrigerator, set the table respectfully since they took the time to cook all of this, use good plates, wine glasses, all the stuff, manage the meal and make sure everyone has food, drinks, water, etc., also manage my 2 month old and feed him, let people hold him if they appear not sick, clean after the meal, get out desserts and all the plates and coffee and cups that go with it, clean again, etc. 

I’m sure you guys can understand there is a difference between a fun casual pizza holiday party and hosting a legitimate holiday meal. Going to a restaurant for brunch is supposed to be instead of a nice meal at home. But now I’m supposed to do both? 

Should I just suck it up and host this meal? The grandmas are 90 and who knows how many more holidays we’ll have together. An important note is they’re going to have their own legitimate new years meal together on 1/1 with all the special foods so it’s not like if we don’t do it at my house they won’t do it at all.

1hd2fki,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1hd2fki/seline_was_fantastic/,Seline was fantastic ,"Seline recently opened in Santa Monica and is David Beran’s newest restaurant. 

TL;DR up front: It’s absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend going. The food is incredible, the hospitality is as gracious, and the ambiance is a delight. Going as a single diner was worth it, and the staff made it so I never felt lonely. The nonalcoholic pairing was well worth it too. 

Please don’t read descriptions if you want to be surprised when you go. It’s worth going in at least a little blind.

More details:

Seline’s ambiance separates itself from busy Santa Monica to create a serene and elegant environment. The dining room blends with the kitchen, so it’s more than just an open concept and becomes a seamless unit, like eating at a really chic friend’s house. The cookbook library next to the kitchen completes the homey look, but the books are all tomes of culinary cuisine and the art on the walls reminds you that this is still a serious restaurant worthy of acclaim.

That acclaim is earned by both the food and the hospitality.

First up was a warm mushroom soup, tinted with vanilla and seaweed. Started off with a total homerun, this was the perfect opening taste. With a deep mushroom umami, punctuated by warm vanilla and saline vibes, this combined the comforts of a hearty homey stew with the depth of a good dashi and the childlike memory of hot chocolate. Perfect on a (relatively) cold night. It really combined the best of a warm udon soup, an Irish stew, and hot chocolate. Hits the tastebuds from all directions.

Next came the first in the nonalcoholic pairing: a pear cider with pine. This was light and refreshing. On its own it was nice but it paired really well with the coming courses.

Next course was a matsutake chawanmushi, trout roe with beech mushrooms, and smoked trout. This was tasty with balanced smokiness and brininess. While good, this was the least favorite of mine on the menu, but it was still very nice. 

Up third was the climax of the mushroom progression: grilled maitake with smoked date puree and lapsang souchong bbq sauce and marjoram. This fucking slapped. Perfect texture on the mushrooms and excellent balance of flavor and texture. Could have stopped here and left happy. The smoke just played perfectly with the grilled mushroom and sweet dates. Like if a forest wizard made an edible campfire. 

Next drink was a cucumber juice with coriander, this was a step up in flavor intensity while still being fresh and cleansing, with a solid spice on the finish.

Braised leeks with banana and fennel puree came with a side of an herbed cracker. This was another total banger. Would never have thought to pair banana with leeks and fennel but it just worked. Very savory and bright but still autumnal. Cracker was crispy and fresh with ice plant, nasturtium, and other herbs. Like walking through a California seaside meadow.

A little dessert came next with malted chestnut and wood sorrel. This midway dessert had great malt flavor punctuated by zippy wood sorrel. Texturally pleasing and a welcome change up from all the savory dishes.

The next drink was a rooibos tea with aged vinegars. This was a melody of flavors, more complex than most fine wines. The vinegars lent a depth of flavor to the rooibos. Had a nice umami to it and some sherry like funk.

A squash was presented with various alliums and greens removed onto a plate. The greens had been steamed in the baked squash, lending them a light squash aroma. This ate like a comforting green bean casserole (complete with fried onions) that had been bombarded with a dozen other flavors. Great example of exciting comfort.

The grilled sea bass with ice plant and squash seed was another total homerun. The seaweed looking thing had a toothsome texture that was akin to al dente pasta with some of the chewiness of a mochi, all with deep kelp flavor. The seed sauce had me licking the plate. 

Next came the squash that had been used to cook the salad, gussied up with apple puree, brown butter, black truffle, and sage. Familiar flavors done perfectly. Great balance of tastes so nothing dominated but all elevated. Amazing textures too.

A hibiscus “wine” had the complexity of a nice Syrah, with full tannins and infused spices to give it real zing.

The “obvious” parts of the squab included perfectly cooked breast with sausage stuffed leg, cauliflower puree, fennel puree, currants, and roasted cauliflower. This was a well balanced and tasty meat course. Paired well the hibiscus wine. The sauce was delicious. Not the most exciting course but nice to have something filling with flawless technique. The sausage stuffed leg was especially impressive.

The nonobvious parts of the squab was possibly the most exciting course. Comprised of a cocoa encased liver, hazelnut butter sandwiched in between crispy squab skin, and heart reduction with strawberry covering infused custard, this course sounded like it would be offal dominant but everything just worked. Really roasted that sweet and savory line. The custard ate like caramel flan but with perfectly blended strawberry and squab heart as the caramel. The cocoa liver was probably the most classic combination but worked texturally better than most. The hazelnut bittersweet sandwich was just so pleasing. Great trio that really flexed technique and balance of flavors.

First dessert drink was a banana milk flip (not pictured). This was a tasty banana drink that was straightforward and yummy.

Caviar and coffee was a triumph. The coffee anglaise was perfectly bitter and smooth and paired seamlessly with the caviar. Hazelnut crumble completed the dish. Makes you wonder why coffee and caviar isn’t done more often.

Fig leaf cream with hachiya persimmon and black sesame crumble is in my top three desserts of 2024. It has the nutty and sweet combo like a peanut butter and jelly with the gritty and smooth textures of a perfect parfait. I almost asked for another one, but I was almost full to bursting. 

Final drink was possibly the best: a nonalcoholic Sauternes. Caramelized honey with some saffron, bay leaf, white pepper, and chamomile, this actually tasted like a good Sauternes. Not too sweet and floral with some mild spice and depth of flavor. Hope this stays on the drink menu. It’s awesome.

Next came a contrast in texture and temperature and the most overtly technical dessert. Nitrogen frozen maple syrup with tobacco biscuit crumble served with warm parsnip puree. This was so so so good. Texture and temperature contrast with both familiar and unfamiliar flavors that just worked. 

Final send off mirrored the first taste: another cup of liquid. This was a bracingly cold herbal infusion of mint, eucalyptus, rosemary, and bay leaf. Sweet and with a weighty texture, this tasted like breathing in cold air after chewing mint gum. Very refreshing and like the first winter morning.

This whole menu was art in addition to flavor. It mirrored the progression of autumn to winter, focused on both the time (late fall) and place (Southern California) from a chef who grew up in the Midwest. The flavors bridged familiar with exotic, using ingredients mainly found in Southern California. Time and again I was reminded of hikes along the beach or through a chaparral covered forest. The level of detail in both the food and the restaurant itself made it an experience worth a visit. 

The staff were also extremely gracious and welcoming. Everyone was kind and knowledgeable. Yes, my napkin was folded after my return from the bathroom but also everyone was genuinely excited and helpful. No pretense at all. Even as a solo diner, I never felt bored or lonely, and everyone readily nerded out about both the food and the environment.

While Seline is still new and we’ll have to see about its consistency, and it’s hard to divine what Michelin ever thinks, and it’s 100% true that Michelin is not the ultimate benchmark of restaurant quality, this definitely felt like at least a two Michelin star meal. It was better thought out conceptually and tasted better than most of the two stars I’ve been to and better than any one star. Accolades aside, this is one of the few tasting menus I’m hell bent on returning to in seasons to come. Really hope they continue this energy in the years to come.",11,1734057782.0,FoodLosAngeles,4,0.87,False

I'm still gonna buy anyway rather than buy shit from timmies and starbucks.

Only one local coffee shop in my area sells coffee beans and they only have 2 types. I found one with good reviews that's about 100km away has CAD36.00 shipping fee lmao, even more expensive than those coming from other provinces.

I would say I can finish a bag (340g) in about 3 weeks to 4 weeks. I mostly just use for espresso and there's coffee in the office so I don't go through that much coffee beans. Should I buy two bags to save on shipping or would the coffee be stale by the end?",1,1734057580.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

Chapter 22:

“Derrick.” Unit’s voice, a smooth baritone with a hint of a familiar Midwestern drawl, resonated through the spacious captain’s quarters. “I have acquired some information that may be of considerable interest.”

A low groan rumbled in my chest. The warm embrace of sleep, a rare and precious commodity these days, was ripped away like a cheap blanket. “What is it, Unit?” I mumbled, my voice thick with sleep. “Can’t it wait?” I burrowed deeper into the plush silk bedding, trying to recapture the fleeting remnants of a dream I couldn't quite recall.

“I believe I have pinpointed the location of your home system, Sol.” There was a pause, a subtle shift in Unit’s tone that hinted at something… more. A hesitation I hadn’t heard before.

“Sol?” It took a minute. It really shouldn't have honestly. “Oh! The Solar system. Of course.” Dumbass. “Yeah. Alright! Let's go. Heh. I bet we could conquer the world with this ship. Hell, maybe even the old one. Not that I'd want to. Just… You know.” I glanced down at the ring on my finger, its surface dulled with scratches and grime. I’d have to polish it up before I saw my wife. She’d kill me if I messed up my ring. Again.

“Derrick. There's something you should know-” I cut Unit off.

“No time for chit-chat, Unit. I'm craving a goddamn coke and some instant noodles. Maybe a coffee. And McDonald’s. Oh, and Taco Bell. Definitely Taco Bell.” I could practically taste the industrial plastic cheese already. My stomach rumbled in agreement. “Set a course, Unit. Let’s get this show on the road.”

I was already out of bed, stretching and popping my back like a rusty hinge. “You've got me all riled up.” I chuckled, stretching my legs. “I'll go jog down to Vorak and tell him the news myself.”

It took a minute, but I made my way down to the workshop where Vorak was working. I waited for the sliding door to open. It's kinda hard to burst into a room when the ship only had sliding doors. He seemed to be working on deconstructing the neutron lance. The ruby I grabbed was sitting next to a deconstructed shield generator.

“Working hard I see.” I panted, out of breath. “We found my home system.”

“We did?” Vorak paused in his tinkering, clearly thinking to himself.

“Yeah. Well, at least Unit did.” I was gitty. Oh yeah, of course I was. I could go home and see my wife. She'd probably be pissed but hey, it's only been a month. I think Vorak would like her. She's smart. Smarter than me at least.

“Right.” Vorak's eyes squinted slightly. “Human Derrick, if you don't mind, I would appreciate some privacy. I have to… Focus.” There was some hesitation.

Vorak’s hesitation wasn’t lost on me, but I chalked it up to his usual meticulous nature. He was always a little cagey when deep into a project. I gave him a quick thumbs-up and turned to leave. “Alright man, kick some ass and don't get your ass kicked.”

I jogged out of Vorak's workshop, the door sliding shut behind me with a soft hiss. Something about his tone nagged at the back of my mind, but I pushed it aside. Vorak was always weirdly intense when he was working on something big. Probably trying to figure out how to reverse-engineer that neutron lance we picked up. No big deal. My focus was on getting home.

""Unit,"" I said, my voice echoing down the corridor as I made my way back to the cockpit, ""how long until the skip drive's ready for another jump? Think we can shave off some of that recharge time?”

""Negative, Captain,"" Unit replied. ""The recharge cycle for the skip drive is fixed due to energy constraints. Any attempt to accelerate the process would risk a catastrophic failure.""

""Yeah, yeah, fine,"" I muttered, waving a hand dismissively as if Unit could see me. ""Just let me know the second we can jump again. I’m itching to taste some homemade Mac and cheese.” Seriously. I'm so sick and tired of that nutrient paste. It gets worse and worse by the day.

“Affirmative, Captain,” Unit replied, its voice as smooth and reassuring as a glass of warm milk. “I will alert you the moment the skip drive is fully charged.”

I grinned, feeling a surge of anticipation. Home. It was a word that had echoed in my thoughts, a distant dream for what felt like an eternity. But now, it was within reach. Just a few more hours, and I’d be back on Earth, back in the arms of my wife, back to a life that felt both so close yet impossibly far.

“You know,” I said, settling back into the captain’s chair, a much more comfortable design that made our old ship’s floor seem like a medieval torture device, “this whole space pirate thing… It’s not so bad.  A little chaotic, sure, dangerous of course. Really dangerous actually. But hey, who needs a nine-to-five when you can steal spaceships and explore the galaxy?” I chuckled, feeling a surge of exhilaration. I’d faced down giant spiders, looted tomb worlds, and even managed to survive a botched brain surgery… Well, two actually. What was a little intergalactic travel compared to that?

Still, it'd be best to start learning the ins and outs of our ship’s operating system while I have time. Luckily, Unit has my back. “Say, Unit. Are you sure you didn't translate everything to English?”

“I'm positive. The language is still in Glargonian. There's been no changes in the display.” Unit replied.

“Huh. Yeah, I thought so. It felt familiar.” I replied, popping my neck. “I think those Nanomachines in my bloodstream rebuilt the Universal translator. Maybe. Or they're doing something like that anyway.”

I leaned back in the captain’s chair, letting the thought of the translator work itself out. It made sense. Whatever those nanomachines were doing, they seemed to be keeping me alive and adapting to me and my environment.

“Unit,” I said, rubbing my temples, “add ‘nanomachines’ to the growing list of things I don’t understand about my body but probably should figure out.”

Unit ignored that.

""Unit,"" I asked, staring out at the vast expanse of space, ""those nanomachines in me… Any chance they could have tapped into the ship’s systems? Maybe translated the schematics directly to my neural interface or something?""

""Such an interaction is implausible, Captain,"" Unit replied. ""The nanomachines in your system are powered by your body heat and the range of their radio wave signals would be too short to reliably contact any outside sources.”


//Note from Vorak: I spoke to Unit about Derrick's home world. I personally don't know Derrick well enough to know how he'd respond to learning such a thing. Our alliance could break if I inform him personally. That would be impractical to say the least. His species appears to be more emotionally intelligent than my own. I believe he'd either collapse into a depression or a rage beyond what I've seen… I haven't known Derrick long, however, I trust his judgement. It would be a problem if it were compromised.

Derrick did not wish to speak about what happened the following day. He stated “It brought back too many bad memories.” Therefore I shall continue in his stead. Utilizing the skip drive, traversal to the Sol system was achieved. Derrick's enthusiasm remained consistent with previous observations. The system's planetary configuration presents an anomaly: four gaseous giants situated externally, with four solid planets orbiting internally. Standard planetary formation models suggest internal planets within such systems possess excessive mass, thus precluding the development of substantial multicellular life. However, preliminary scans indicate the presence of three planets within Sol's habitable zone. Based on data provided by Derrick, the target planet designated ""Earth"" is situated third from the star.

Arriving at Earth presented minimal navigational challenges. Its proximity to the fourth planet, coupled with orbital alignment, facilitated a swift approach. My optical acuity, surpassing that of Derrick, allowed for immediate observation of the planet's state. The visual data acquired was… distressing. Earth's atmosphere presented a dense, opaque grey hue, obscuring surface details. Upon closer inspection, the planet resolved into a swirling marble of white and grey, suggestive of extensive cloud cover. Atmospheric analysis confirmed the presence of substantial particulate matter, consistent with soot and water vapor. This deviated significantly from Derrick’s descriptions of a vibrant, blue-green world. I have observed its appearance in the media stored on Derrick’s personal device, and I conclude that Earth’s biosphere has collapsed. As assumed, the Archopodes have turned Earth into a Plague World.

Derrick’s reaction was… anomalous. Contrary to predicted emotional outbursts, characterized by either depressive withdrawal or aggressive displays, he exhibited an atypical stoicism. His customary levity and sardonic humor were notably absent, replaced by an unsettling quietude. He remained motionless for a prolonged interval, his gaze fixed on the viewport displaying the desolate vista of his homeworld. His facial musculature contracted slightly, forming vertical furrows above his optical organs. After a protracted silence, he vocalized a single, chilling declaration: “This means war.” Derrick had clearly inferred exactly who was responsible.

He then proceeded to egress the ship’s cockpit, his gait atypically rigid. Unit, via internal communication channels, subsequently informed me of Derrick's activities within the designated captain's quarters. Acoustic analysis suggested percussive impacts against the vessel's interior bulkheads, consistent with the application of substantial kinetic force. Unit further reported visual confirmation of epidermal lacerations on Derrick's metacarpophalangeal joints, presumably resulting from said impacts. This behavior, while not entirely unanticipated given the circumstances, deviated significantly from established human behavioral baselines in response to emotional distress. Hypotheses regarding the underlying cause of this atypical reaction include, but are not limited to: suppressed emotional response, atypical neurological processing, or the potential influence of the previously documented nanomachinery within Derrick's physiology. Further observation and analysis are required to ascertain the precise causative factors.

She and I did everything together and she was one of the first people I genuinely felt pure friendship from. We read the same books and would talk about them all the time, and she even made me a necklace inspired by one of the books, which I still wear. Our friendship really meant a lot to me. But in high school I came out as gay and openly drank coffee and she just stopped talking to me. I had so many classes with her and she didn’t talk to me once after I came out. I was so lonely in high school because she and my entire friend group abandoned me when I came out. I know how she treated me was shitty, just because I was leaving the faith and gay. But I still think about her, and how life would have been different had we stayed friends. It’s one of the main things that hurts, years after I left. The church instilled so much prejudice into my dear friend, that she would rather abandon our friendship than seek to understand. I know she doesn’t want to be friends anymore. She made that abundantly clear in high school. But damn it still hurts, all these years later. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest in a community of people who understand. The church took my best friends away from me, and it still hurts, and right now I’m really mourning that loss. ",3,1734057412.0,exmormon,0,0.72,False

It was super yummy but I feel the parsnips didn’t shine thru as I wanted them too. Lots of spices in here(also used some special spice blends that included coffee and cocoa)made a lil walnut dukkah, clementine marmalade and buttery caramelized raisins for garniture. I attempted a persimmon jam for the filling but I walked away from it and let it burrrrrn :-( 

Overall I was happy with it and it had great depth of flavor plus it looked sooo cuteeee! 


For next time I will definitely not burn the persimmon jam. I will either make a sweet parsnip puree for layering or perhaps find away to incorporate parsnip into the frosting!

1hd1zsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1hd1zsy/sleeping_in_denied/,Sleeping in denied?,"Okay, so.. . A little back story.. I'm (40-ish m) working 75+ hours a week between two jobs to support my family of 9. Yes, 9. 7 children, 2 adults. Yes, it's a large family. ""Blended"" i should say. The father of 5 of the children got off scott free without having to pay a single dime in child support. 

So that leaves me being the only ""bread winner"" of the house. I work 2 pretty physically demanding jobs and bring home alright money. But... I'm ALWAYS exhausted.  Tired, in pain, stressed and I usually get 3-5 hours of sleep per evening due to either the chaos of the home, or because of my double job days. 14-18 hours. 

Anyways, i finally get a Saturday off from job #1 and I openly admit to my better half (40-ish f) that I'd rather enjoy sleeping in on Saturday due to not having to work. 

The response that was given? ""Nah, I've got to much to do, you can sleep in Sunday,  until like, 9am.""

I immediately went from being excited about sleeping,  to resentment.  

This is just one example of the stuff that I deal with on a daily basis. Every conversation must end with either her being right, or me being 100% wrong. 

The other say I was instructed how to make my coffee.. that I've been making, every morning,  on my own, for 20+ years. 

I'm rambling now. Anyways, I just wanted to vent. All I want is sleep. 😮‍💨",16,1734056401.0,Manipulation,14,1.0,False
