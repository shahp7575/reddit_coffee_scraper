1is9eve,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1is9eve/pain_underneath_left_lower_rib_cage/,Pain underneath left lower rib cage,"For the past 5 months I (M31) have had pain underneath my left lower rib cage, which also gravitates towards the back at times. It is always worse when I wake up, and slowly fades away throughout the day, only to be back in full force the next morning (or in the middle of the night if I wake up then). The pain is rather dull and sore, but strong, almost like someone roundhouse kicked my internal organs and left a nasty bruise. I've seen 3 doctors, had an X-ray, a scanner, and done multiple blood tests, all leaving me with no answers. It's beginning to disrupt my sleep quite a bit so I'm seeking answers here from anyone who might be able to suggest what my next steps should be.

  
Male, 31, white, non-smoker, moderate drinker (heavyish in the past), taking no medications currently but have been prescribed Citalopram, Prozac, Alprazolam, and Accutane in the past. Vegan. Heavy black-tea drinker, no coffee. Based in France.

I was wondering if there are any fellow car enthusiasts in Tokyo who‚Äôd be interested in an¬†**informal Cars & Coffee-style gathering:**¬†nothing too structured, just an easygoing meetup at rotating locations in/around Tokyo, to talk cars over coffee and maybe go for a scenic drive afterward.

The idea is simple:¬†**All cars, all drivers, all experience levels welcome:**¬†whether you have a classic, a sports car, a daily driver, or just love talking about cars. If car-less people want to come over and grab coffee too, that's great but maybe best to avoid soliciting rides from strangers? I don't know, suggestions and thoughts are very much welcome!

At this point, I‚Äôm just seeing if there‚Äôs interest. If enough people are keen, we could figure out a weekly schedule. I am aware there is the Daikanyama t-site that organizes a themed gathering almost every Sunday but this one could be more open and generic.

Anyway, just an idea at this stage. Drop a comment if this sounds fun, and let‚Äôs see if we can get something going!",1,1739873141.0,tokyosocial,0,1.0,False

There were literally hundreds of kid events in a week that you could go to, kids play spaces and coffee shops (even a nail salon!) catered to stay at home parents, lots of city programs/resources for moms, virtually every mom I met stayed home, etc. even if there was none of this, the weather was perfectly mild and there was so much free/nature stuff to do at all times. The ironic part is I was only home for 1 out of the 3 years of my toddlers life here so it‚Äôs not like I got to fully take advantage.

Now we‚Äôre in the process of moving for my husbands job. It‚Äôs another city but generally way less kids and way more career focused. Luckily we are from here so know some people and resources.

Wtf do I do during the week and especially so that I can meet other stay at home moms? Are there even other ones here?!?

Since bata po ako, I‚Äôve always been an introvert. I hate crowded places, so lagi po akong naghahanap ng quiet caf√©s or restaurants na ma-enjoy ko po yung coffee or food ko. But too often, I arrive at a place only to find it packed‚Äîno available seats, no peaceful atmosphere. Tapos, I have to walk around searching for another spot, unsure if the next place is full too. It‚Äôs frustrating and honestly po a waste of time and money.

So I started thinking po‚Ä¶ what if there was an app that lets you check how crowded a caf√© or restaurant is before po kayo lumabas ng bahay?

I built this app for myself, and now I‚Äôm considering sharing it with others who also prefer less crowded spaces, especially in busy cities. Do you think po kaya this would help people living in urbanized cities in the Philippines?

Would this be something you'd use? Useful po kaya siya? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts po! üôè

I was struck with COVID ans Sjoergens disesse WHILE living in a household with mold present.
Got dangerously sick for a while.

Better now, 4 years later, but it f**** me up in many ways long term. The most persistant symptoms i experience are as following:

-autoimmune disturbances (got fibro diagnosis)
-stuffed sinuses, nose clogged 24/7
-pains and aches throughout my body
-severe food intolerance
-burning sensation under my skin
-extreme brainfog
-weird body anxiety (even tho my mind is all fine, and i am feeling good, body still vibrates and somehow coffee helps)‚Ä¶
-DP/DR dissosiating and feeling like a ghost
-stomach problems / bad digestion
-sensitivity to sunlight / headache
-blurry vision and trouble focusing

The list could go on for serveral paragraphs but theese are the most prominant ones. I have been under medical supervition by serveral doctors, but there is little to nothing they can do. It‚Äôs mostly I who suggest medications etc. Will be attenting a rehabilitation centre in March, and hopefully there are some experts there that might help me out.
I have tried serveral supplements and some medications, yet another long list but theese are the things worth mentioning:

-LDN, Low Dose Naltrexone (by far the most helpful thing i have tried)
-Moclobemide, MAOI (helped depression and brainfog but also made me agitated)
-St Johns Wort (helped depression abit but nothing ground breaking)
-Antihistamines (does work if im in a bad flare / food reaction etc)
-Ibuprofen and Paracetamol (I mean, duh)
-Cannabis, daily (I know there are pros and cons to this one, but it seems low risk compared to Tramadol, Paralgin Forte or other stronger pain meds that doctor is willing to perscribe).

-L-Arginine
-L-Carnintine
-B12
-Melatonin
-L-Citruline
-Fish Oil
-Taurine
-L-Lysine
-Creatine

‚Ä¶And probably 100 more different things lol.
Theese are mentioned cause theese are the ones I‚Äôm still on and notice somewhat of a benefit with vs without. I have tried to be smart about it, and cycle different supplements, giving them time, staying off all for a while etc. None of theese mentions have given any deep benefits. Fish Oil, Taurine and B12 probably being the ones with most prominent effects‚Äî for innflamation, jittery feeling and energy.

Naturally, I now come to this page seeking some advice. Some supplements or nootropics, even medications I could draft with my gp, whatever you can think of. 

And yes‚Äî I try to get good sleep, tho it‚Äôs very hard between the stuffy nose and body pains.
I try to walk as much as I can, and at this stage working out, or lifting weights does more harm than good since my body is really struggeling to restituate. I try to do Yoga and basic stretching as long as I have the energy for it. Keeping a clean home, nice and tidy. Also I‚Äôm on somewhat of a carnivoure diet because 9 out of 10 foods gives me an aoutoimmune flare up. 

I apologize for any spelling errors in this post, had a very bad night, not enough sleep and I am Norwegian.

(TW: I‚Äôm reluctant to say this, but I‚Äôm sometimes borderline suicidal because of the torture chamber I exist in daily, with very little help from doctors and generally missing out on most things in life, social things and family etc. Luckaly I always know that this feeling passes, and my life is much bigger than me, so I never invest in any suicidal thoughts or behaviours. I very much love myself and those around. But I really neee some help at this point).",1,1739872578.0,Fibromyalgia,0,1.0,False
1is97lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1is97lv/i_thought_he_was_back_but_i_think_hes_gone_again/,I thought he was back ‚Äî but I think he‚Äôs gone again.,"My DA ghosted me a year ago. We had just had an intimate conversation that I thought went really well, and shortly after it, he ghosted. I figured it was because of a 3rd party, or he found someone easier. I wanted to hate him, and sometimes I thought I did, but I couldn‚Äôt. My love for him ran too deep.

In October, he reached out and wondered how I was (this was after ghosting those 6 months). January 7th, he wished me a happy new year.
January 31st, he sent me a message.  He texted, ""Hey - sorry to bug you out of the blue. Would you be interested in catching up over a coffee or something...just a friendly meet up?"" We agreed to meet for coffee. (Even though everyone told me he didn't deserve it, I truly wanted to hear what he'd have to say.) Then he asked if l'd mind going out to dinner instead. I told him if he wanted to do dinner, we could do that. Sooo, we went out to a nice restaurant and ""caught up"". (Feb. 2nd). We hadn't hugged or seen each other in a year. Right away, he said, ""I know I fell off the radar for a while, and I'm sorry."" I was honest with him, ""I was really hurt. You broke my heart, and I've been trying to heal for months."" And then he reiterated, ""I'm sorry. And I know my words mean nothing without a change in my behavior.""

We had dinner, and 3 times throughout the night and when he walked me to my car, he said he reallyyy wanted to start again and begin where we left off, if I was open to it. I said ‚Äútime will tell by behavior changed.‚Äù (Like he himself said).

Two days later, he asked if l'd like to have dinner at his house the following weekend. In the rush of the moment, I really wanted to‚Äîso I agreed. 

So... a week ago last weekend (2/9), I had dinner at his house. It was so good to be reunited. He made me a charcuterie board for an appetizer, and then he grilled turkey burgers, made a nice salad and had fries. We talked throughout the evening, and he put his hand on my knee.

He walked me to my car afterwards, and the strong emotions and passion I felt for him couldn't be stopped. We hugged each other in a full body, bear hug. I looked at him and kissed him softly. Next thing I know, he French kissing me back. It surprised me, and we pulled back. He had a stupid grin on his face, ""Ohhh, so we‚Äôre going to kiss finally."" I got shy and went back in for a hug, and he put his hand into my hair and stroked my scalp. It was so sweet and romantic. I squeezed his hand, and he squeezed mine in return. ‚ÄúBye ____,‚Äù I said softly as I went to get in my car.

He texted when I got home saying that he liked it, and he was glad I kissed him.

I didn't hear from him for a couple days, and I started to get anxious. Was the kiss a turn off? Did he decide he didn't feel the connection anymore?

He texted three days later (after our kiss) and said he ""enjoyed my company the other night."" I said, ""It was a nice evening,"" and he goes, ""It was *very* nice."" 

That was a few days ago now, and he hasn't reached out since. Two nights ago, I decided to reach out myself, ‚Äújust to say ‚Äòhi‚Äô and I hope you have a wonderful week.‚Äù He hasn‚Äôt replied or responded. üíîüòû I think he's ghosting/running again. I feel it. Why!?!

So many people in my life would say, ""Move on. He doesn't deserve you. Don't waste your time and energy on him. He's a player.""

I don't want to settle for less than I deserve, but I also can't just ""turn off"" my love & care for him! It's like, even though you wish you could hate this person, and cut them off forever, you can't. No matter how they've hurt you, your love and care for them run deeply.

I guess I'm just hurting, because I feel like he's running away again, when our love and care for each other has felt so real. But then my anxiety kicks in when he can go days at a time without communication. I want to kiss him again. I want to feel our hugs again. I even crave s*xu*l union at this point.

I‚Äôm hurting today. üòû",2,1739872447.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1is97j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1is97j2/observation/,Observation,"33f PhD govt assistant professor talked to a prospect 31 M. MD pediatrics.

He didn't reveal two things in first few weeks while ensuring full transparency from my side. 

He has a sibling who's dependent on him. Depressed from last 5 years and taking medication and high school drop out.

The guy has genetic thyroid..he takes regular medicine.


Both these things were revealed much later. He's the sole bread winner. Earlier he told brother is student. Recently he revealed about brothers depression, sister's separation and parents losing money on hefty dowry of sister and looking for negotiation for getting his sister back to inlaws. Sister is unemployed and simple graduate. 

Tbh, i was ok he assured me that these problems will be sorted with time but what hurt me most was lying about genetic thyroid condition and i suspect God knows what will come next. Whenever i would ask him about his bond with family and siblings, he will dodge the question. He asked me everything about my family, my brother and no financial liability since my father is no more..i answered him correctly and honestly but i feel this guy lied to me about so many things. God knows what's gonna come next. He also revealed his family expects hefty dowry and function and girl earning minimum 1 lakh per annum and atleast a doctor/ doctorate because they have given their sister dowry but they are not finding any given their status and siblings issues. His sister is simple unemployed graduate married into much wealthy family and doctor spouse.

.sometimes he  made me feel less because I'm not a doctor and he also expected a doctor for himself which  i didn't mind because I'm very happy with what i do. All this has made me distance myself from him because his insecurities and everything showed up daily

He blocked me when i told him I can't match up to these expectations and stopped picking his calls to be just friends.


Now i see this guy returns back every three four months.. recently i saw a valentine's day feel with his fiance who's a dentist and he's copy pasting same messages and making reels with same captions.copy paste poetry he send to me as well. This on valentine's day and came on my feed because he had opened his account privacy and we were mutuals once.My whole thing is he's was always having this dentist girl as side while he was sending me requests and this whole posting of reels and acting like ranveer singh on social media was one thing that put me off when he was talking to me. He wanted all this and me to make reels. He's dark skinned and wanted me to *use my fair skin to advantage to gain followers*..I'm shocked how these two timing entitled flirty guys who want dowry are getting girls. How well are they hiding their intentions? Who's saying yes to them. This guy is all about social media flexing and seeking gifts, car , property from girl. 

I see that people who post on social media lovey dovey stuff"" you are the one""  have always been using apps and chatting with other matches, chasing them even after engagement and marriage.

Another 38 yo M  running his business hit up on my mother's whatapp thinking it's me to meet out for coffee because I share her number. This was a week before his final engagement party. We have close family friendz, common marriage broker so we got to know he's engaged. My mother and marriage broker found this very cheap that guy who has been rokafied and things haven't worked out between us still messaging me , just a week before his engagement party. Imagine wedding dress and rings finalized with one party and seeking other people on side. Broker told my mother to not create issue because he's engaged and 38 and not getting any girl anyways. Saying kids do mistakes , it's very common.

Another guy from my school was using matrimonial app aa single. He has a daughter and wife and post family status on FB, you have given me best gift while using JS as dating app. His wife found out about it but did nothing. Really sad how cheating is forgiven and normalised.

Ofcourse my experience is with guys but girls too are hitting up guys they met through apps and dropping location while being married. I have seen both genders keep options as side while settling for marriage with one who gives dowry or family likes and post soulmate stuff on Instagram.

All this is making lose faith in marriage because people are acting so well, even their family is involved in discussion like we want serious match and no time pass while their own son is doing time pass elsewhere.  ",1,1739872438.0,Arrangedmarriage,1,0.66,False

Naturally, I now come to this page seeking some advice. Some supplements or nootropics, even medications I could draft with my gp, whatever you can think of. 

And yes‚Äî I try to get good sleep, tho it‚Äôs very hard between the stuffy nose and body pains.
I try to walk as much as I can, and at this stage working out, or lifting weights does more harm than good since my body is really struggeling to restituate. I try to do Yoga and basic stretching as long as I have the energy for it. Keeping a clean home, nice and tidy. Also I‚Äôm on somewhat of a carnivoure diet because 9 out of 10 foods gives me an aoutoimmune flare up. 

I apologize for any spelling errors in this post, had a very bad night, not enough sleep and I am Norwegian.

(TW: I‚Äôm reluctant to say this, but I‚Äôm sometimes borderline suicidal because of the torture chamber I exist in daily, with very little help from doctors and generally missing out on most things in life, social things and family etc. Luckaly I always know that this feeling passes, and my life is much bigger than me, so I never invest in any suicidal thoughts or behaviours. I very much love myself and those around. But I really neee some help at this point).",1,1739872350.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

I failed my road test when I was sixteen. I'm in my early/mid forties now and I never tried again. I haven't because I know that it's just something I can't do. My ADHD makes me too distractible; my dyspraxia gives me slow reflexes; I have anxiety attacks because I worry I'm going to hit someone. I also get random rage spikes and sometimes just randomly forget how to do something--like which way to turn a key or which button turns on my phone. I could easily see myself forgetting which pedal is the gas and which is the brake and causing a huge wreck.

I can't do it. I can't do it just like a lot of people can't make a sculpture or dance or speed read. Nobody gives anyone grief for not being able to do those, and yet my entire life people have scolded me for not doing this. My former partner would get angry at me, as would my former mother-in-law. Other people have told me flat-out or insinuated that I could ""really do it if \[I\] wanted."" I've never been able to go somewhere when I wanted to. I've had to beg rides from people. There have been times when I had no food and the person I was living with didn't want to go get any/ was too tired to get any, so I either paid too much for delivery or went hungry for a while. 

I feel horrible about this every single day. Often for the entire day. I have a family member who needs people to drive her to appointments and I can't do it, despite  not having a disability that would legally prohibit me from driving. I live with my elderly mother who needs to go places and I can't help her. 

There are no people in my life I feel comfortable reaching out to family. I know that drivers don't like being friends with non-drivers and look down on us, and I'd never want to put someone out. I don't want them to feel like they're my chauffer. The one local friend I have is also severely mentally ill and can't drive either.  I can't go anywhere or do anything without taking a Lyft, and they're expensive. I can't meet people. I will never date again or find a partner. My life doesn't feel like it's worth living all because I can't operate some fucking tool that society insists everyone must operate. If I could drive, I wouldn't be half as depressed and anxious as I am. I would have friends. I would be able to do basic things like get a coffee as a treat or take my relatives to doctors appointments.

I just wish my life wasn't like this. I'm so tired.",2,1739872191.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1is8jce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nutrition_Healthy/comments/1is8jce/is_this_a_good_coffee_alternative_dragonfruit/,Is This a Good Coffee Alternative? (Dragonfruit Energy Drink Review & Ingredients Breakdown),"Hey r/nutrition,

I drink a lot of coffee daily but often experience **afternoon crashes** and fatigue. I recently came across this [Dragonfruit-flavored energy drink](https://uk.weareholy.com/pages/our-ingredients) and was wondering if it could be a better alternative. It contains caffeine but also other nootropics like L-theanine, which supposedly helps prevent the jittery feeling and crash that coffee can cause.

I‚Äôm considering drinking this **once or twice a day**, but I also wonder if it‚Äôs okay to still have **one coffee occasionally** with it. I also have **IBS**, so I‚Äôm a bit cautious about certain ingredients (especially artificial sweeteners and fibers like inulin).

Here‚Äôs the full **nutritional breakdown per serving (500ml / 7g powder):**

# üîπ Macronutrients & Basic Info

* **Energy:** 72.2 kJ (17.2 kcal)
* **Fat:** <0.1g
* **Carbohydrates:** 0.8g (of which sugars: 0.4g)
* **Dietary Fiber:** 2.7g
* **Protein:** 0.7g

* **Vitamin B3 (Niacin):** 16.2 mg (101%)
* **Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid):** 6.1 mg (102%)
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** 1.7 mg (100%)
* **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):** 2.5 ¬µg (100%)

# üîπ Nootropics & Caffeine Complex

* **NewCaff75¬Æ (extended-release caffeine):** 106 mg
* **Total Caffeine:** 160 mg (from natural caffeine & NewCaff75¬Æ)
* **L-Theanine (from green tea extract):** 99.8 mg
* **L-Tyrosine:** 500 mg
* **LipoCholine¬Æ (Choline source):** 500 mg
* **Green Tea Extract (EGCG content: 36.7 mg)**
* **Inositol:** 50.1 mg
* **Ginseng Extract:** 99.8 mg
* **Piperine (Black Pepper Extract):** 2 mg

# üîπ Ingredients List

* \*\*Inulin (fiber)
* Acidulants (Citric acid, Malic acid)
* L-Tyrosine
* DL-Choline Bitartrate (LipoCholine¬Æ)
* Green Tea Extract (contains L-Theanine)

* Niacinamide
* Calcium Pantothenate
* Piperine (Black Pepper Extract)
* Pyridoxine Hydrochloride
* Riboflavin
* Cholecalciferol
* Cyanocobalamin\*\*

# üîπ Warnings & Considerations

* **High caffeine content (160mg per serving)** ‚Äì Not for kids, pregnant women, or caffeine-sensitive people.
* **Contains green tea extract (EGCG)** ‚Äì Recommended **max daily intake = 800mg EGCG**, so be mindful if consuming other green tea products.
* **Contains inulin (prebiotic fiber)** ‚Äì Might cause bloating for some, especially IBS sufferers.
* **Sweeteners (Sucralose, Acesulfame K)** ‚Äì No Stevia (which I dislike), but still artificial.

# üîπ My Main Questions:

1. **Is this a good alternative to coffee to avoid crashes?**
2. **Would drinking this daily (or twice a day) be safe?**
3. **Would one occasional coffee on top of this be okay?**
4. **Any concerns regarding the ingredients, especially for someone with IBS?**

I spent the last few months with 20+ salon owners, and what I discovered kept me up was pretty suprising: even successful salons are silently losing $3,250 monthly in regular clients who just... disappear.

Here's what I've discoveered so far:

\- Almost all clients (92%) never say goodbye - they just stretch out their visits until they stop coming...

\- Most salons don't notice someone's gone for 3-4 months...

\- By the time you realize it, they're already comfortable at another salon...

\- That's $39K walking out the door yearly...

Every owner I talked to was frustrated because:

\- Their clients hate downloading ""yet another app""...

\- Those paper cards? They end up in the washing machine...

\- The fancy POS systems cost a fortune ($2000+/month)...

\- Nobody knows a client is leaving until they're gone...

I couldn't stop thinking about this, so I started building something super simple:

\- It just works with Apple/Google Pay (no app hassle)...

\- Spots when clients start visiting less often...

\- Gives you a heads up before they're gone...

\- Sets up faster than making a coffee...

I'd love to get some feedback & some insights:

\- How do you keep track of your regulars now?

\- What have you tried that didn't work?

\- Would you want to know when someone's visits start dropping off?

Not here to sell - I'm building this because I genuinely want to solve this problem. Your real-world experience would be really helpful.

One is the decaf rainbow honey Caturra, a honey process co-ferment with a blend of fruits (SCA score of 88 for this one!). Haven't tried this one yet but hoping to grab some green samples. I've only seen this at Grey Roasting Co at the moment in NZ and trying to order some...

The other option is a natural Castillo that's a bit more traditional. I had this one from Miro (Switzerland) and Abyss (Abyss) and it's similar to some of the Jairo Arcila decafs from previous years. Full bodied and wine like with red fruits and chocolate notes.

1is8bxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1is8bxn/the_end_for_now/,The End (for now),"In a distant future, above a small cafe, in the streets of a small mountain town, there is an apartment. The air smells of paint, ink, and roasted beans. Danielle stretches, as the gentle sun caresses her face. She rolls over to the window and watches the people below, going about their day: there are children climbing snow piles, pedestrians losing balance on the icy sidewalk, lovers brushing shoulders as they giggle and whisper to each other, greetings are shared by passers-by. 

Everyone knows everyone in this little town. There is full transparency amongst the residents. Your past and future simply do not exist here; there is only the now. 

At first it was hard to gain trust. There were not a lot of newcomers in this town and she was very careful with sharing her past. But over time, with patience and consistency, as well as the start of her writing career, she has built a reputation here, one of grace and patience. As her writing gained recognition, people began to piece together parts of her past and seemed to respect her for her perseverance and courage. Most people know how she ended up here, her past is respected and rarely spoken about. Every now and then, someone asks about the person she used to be after reading one of her books, but she doesn‚Äôt mind‚Äîit‚Äôs a consequence of honesty she has learned to accept. Curiosity came with kindness, rather than judgement. She once feared being seen through the lens of her mistakes, but enjoys helping people in similar situations. She was living proof that things get better‚Äîthat change wasn‚Äôt just possible, but real. If her words could be the turning point for someone else, every question was worth it.

Her cafe is a safe space for a lot of people and a great place for a huge variety of quality coffee and baking. There is a small communal library by the fire pit, surrounded by worn-in couches. Her paintings and drawings cover the walls of the cafe, framed. She knows the name of everyone that walks in, and knows the order of each of them. She treats everyone with kindness. She comes off as bubbly but caring, and gentle but charismatic.

There was a time she was someone that wouldn‚Äôt be able to relate to the kind of person she was now. She never knew this kind of peace and contentment was achievable, especially for someone like her. She remembers a time when every silence was too loud, every stillness a threat. It used to feel as if everyone was out to get her. She was alone and holding on by a string. But here, in this little pocket of the world, surrounded by snowy giants, she built something steady, something safe, and kind. The cafe is hers. Every chipped saucer, every worn out page of different and unique recipes she created herself, even the beaten up oven that needs maintenance every week, were all a testament to her patience. She built this place, brick by brick, and no one would dare take that away.

The middle shelf of the communal library is filled with her poetry and short stories. There are a few published books but she prints out some of her rough drafts for review. A mug sits on top of the shelf, holding writing utensils for those that want to make corrections and give constructive criticisms on her drafts. She runs a book club and has made great acquaintances with the writers and artists of this town. They share and comment on each other‚Äôs works; positive reinforcements and suggestions are shared every sunday afternoon.

Her email inbox and her P.O. box are filled with letters and mail from strangers, thanking her for making them feel less alone with her writing. Sometimes there are foreign snacks, drawings of her fictional characters, stickers, pictures of the readers, or sometimes even short stories inspired by her own. She writes back with gratitude to each and every one, thanking them for spending the time to read her works, for their kind words, and their generosity. She prints out each email, and collects the physical ones mailed to her. She dates them and tucks them in with the rest in a box beneath her bed. The letter she wrote to herself years ago, from a place she barely remembers, with memories she still cherishes, rests at the very bottom of the box. She dares not read it when she is in a particular mood but she is grateful for the person that wrote it. It now exists as a reminder of a past self who would have never believed in this kind of fairy tale ending for herself.

There is a humming in the kitchen. A man with a streak of flour on his cheek, walks over to her, still in bed, looking a mess, but he comments on how beautiful she looks and kisses her forehead. He hands her a coffee, poured in her favourite mug, the one he made for her, with Meo and Eggtart poking their heads out from teacups. As if to hear my thoughts, the cats meow and jump on the bed, making themselves comfortable in the sun. 

‚Äî
Love is no longer something she has to prove or chase or something she can only receive as someone she isn‚Äôt. It exists, simply because she exists. This love doesn't hurt her or scare her. He is not scared or disappointed by her flaws or her past. He simply holds her for everything she is: every word, every paint stroke, every scar on her body. She is heard and seen. She is loved.

He is like the mountains that surround her: steady, kind, reliable. He is as warm as the blinding sun and as refreshing as the morning breeze. He exists to be leaned on when she stumbles and to celebrate her with every little step. He is her life and she is his. He bakes the goods that go with her coffee. He is impressed by her talent with her every creation and makes comments that make her feel understood. His gentle breathing in the late nights fuel her as she types pages after pages of a different world. Every book and every painting is a mirror. They are tools she uses for self reflection. When she is done painting her soul in the form of a scene, she crawls into his arms and his steady heartbeat sings her a lullaby. Every day ends this way and she thanks all the gods for their mercy and generosity. 
‚Äî

I thank him for the coffee as he sits down next to me with a cup of camomile tea.

‚ÄúDid you sleep well? I noticed you made some progress on your new novel last night. How late did you stay up?‚Äù he asks as he tucks my hair behind my ears. 

‚ÄúI was asleep before the sun came up this time! I did sleep pretty late though, the creative juices were overflowing last night,‚Äù I chuckle as I respond dramatically.

‚ÄúWell, we have a business to run, young lady. Remember you have a meeting at the bank this afternoon, so you should get ready so I can take you lunch before boss lady Danielle comes around,‚Äù he reminds me before he takes a sip. ‚ÄúOh, and I have something to give you,‚Äù he places his mug down on the desk as he hurries himself to the kitchen.

I watch the doorway where he disappeared, impatiently, trying to guess what it might be. I tilt my head to try to see what he‚Äôs doing in the kitchen. When he returns, he holds in his hand, a small bouquet of red tulips and baby‚Äôs-breath. He goes on one knee and hands them to me,

‚ÄúDanielle, marrying you was the single greatest decision of my life. I fall in love with you a little more every day. I have so much respect for you and you never fail to exceed my expectations with your creativity and kindness. Thank you for giving me the honour to be your partner in life,‚Äù his voice cracks, and he pauses to swallow his tears. ‚Äú If I could propose to you again and double marry you, I would. Happy anniversary, honey,‚Äù he gets up and leans down to give me a hug as I start to tear up, clutching onto the flowers. 

‚ÄúNathaniel‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to thank you. I don‚Äôt know how I got so lucky,‚Äù I pause, smelling the flowers and readjusting the baby‚Äôs-breath. ‚ÄúYou are the love of my life and my knight in shinning armour. When I moved here with nothing, running from the past, you didn‚Äôt hesitate, once, to help me,‚Äù I start to cry with tears of joy. ‚ÄúI really believe you are a gift from God for me to start anew, and I‚Äôm so grateful for the life we built together. I can‚Äôt wait for the years to come. As long as you‚Äôre by my side, I‚Äôm invincible, and whatever path we choose to go down, will be the right one. I love you with all my heart,‚Äù I finish as I wipe away my tears.

I place my coffee down beside his tea and jump into his arms. We share a kiss, and he puts me down. His hands rest on my hips as he looks into my eyes, adoringly. 

‚ÄúLife is good,‚Äù he whispers under his breath.

Life is good. All is well. I open the desk drawer and pull out a painting of him that I had hidden,

‚ÄúYou thought I forgot, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù I say with a smirk as I hand him the painting. It is of him reading with one hand holding a cup of tea. The steam curls up, glowing from the sunlight.

His jaw drops and he is speechless as he takes in the details,

‚ÄúYou remembered my birthmark,‚Äù he says with a smile. ‚ÄúThis is incredible, honey. I love it. Thank you so much. I‚Äôm gonna put it up by my side in the study.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wrote you a letter on the back as well,‚Äù I say, as I take it from his hands and flip it over.

‚ÄúHow did you even think to do that? Wow. You really are something,‚Äù he says, as he leans in for a kiss. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna save the letter for when you‚Äôre at your meeting. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do with myself while you‚Äôre taking care of business,‚Äù he sighs and shakes his head. He peaks with one eye to see if that made me laugh, and finds me giggling.

I reach over to fix his hair,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll live. I‚Äôll let them know that my lovely husband is eagerly waiting for me and to make it quick,‚Äù I smile at him. ‚ÄúI guess I should get ready then,‚Äù I boop his perfect little nose with my pointer finger and make my way over to the bathroom.

I stare at my reflection as I brush my teeth. Her hair is a mess, and her eyes are crusty but her face is bright. She‚Äôs glowing. Vulnerable in safe hands.

It‚Äôs nice to see you. You look beautiful.

As the title suggests it I've got a problem on a Philips 3200.

I fixed it for a client (original problem was that no water came out of the coffee nozzle and that the grinder didn't work anymore), gave it back yesterday, they used it for half a day and they have the coffee tray light on since then. 
I went there and tried all the advices I found on Reddit and internet (take it out 15, then 60 seconds while ON before putting it back) but nothing works.
As the light is on, I can't even do a manual reset as I need to press on the espresso button which is unavailable since the light is on.

I opened the front part of the machine in order to remove the nozzle. Could that be a problem? 
As there is no Sensor and it counts the number of coffees made, what is the item in charge of counting ? I want to check if I misplaced it or did something that damaged it. 

I'm a bit perplex as everything went fine up until this morning...

1is8b14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1is8b14/the_morning_after/,The Morning After,"(trigger warning: self harm and suicide)

I wake up to 10 calls from Kai and 3 from Rowan along with too many messages to care. They‚Äôre both wondering what I will do now, the morning after. I had changed the passcode for my apartment in fear that one, the other, or both would come see me. Skimming over some of the text messages, Rowan seemed to have tried. So, the answer that everyone is waiting for: I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to do anything. I want the last year to just erase and I want Kai and Rowan to both just vanish.

I insisted on being dropped off at my house after the incident; I wanted to be alone with my thoughts and my cats. I had been struck down and humiliated in front of the two people that were convinced I was perfect. They both saw how weak and pathetic I was; all for what? A box of stuff that I could‚Äôve easily replaced? What was I thinking?

Finally I decide to go through the box: a couple shirts, loose socks, pjs, glasses, and the stupid mug. My reputation is ruined because  of such unimportant materials. And this stupid mug. All I really wanted back was this stupid mug. Everything else I could‚Äôve replaced, but I had thrifted it and had some sort of weird attachment to it. I was weirdly drawn when I picked it up for the first time. The interior was painted in a dark brown that hid any coffee stains, the size was perfect for the amount of coffee I consume in one sitting, the handle was just the right size and shape for my hand, and I liked the angel and devil cats painted on either side. 

‚ÄúImagine if you had wings Eggtart,‚Äù I say to him as he‚Äôs purring on my lap. ‚ÄúIf you could fly away, would you?‚Äù Eggtart meows in reply. ‚ÄúIf I had wings I would fly far, far away. Maybe I could check out what heaven is all about.‚Äù I chuckle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky not to have been born human. You don‚Äôt know the half of it,‚Äù he blinks in agreement.

I hold up the mug. I start to feel anger bubbling up. Stupid mug. I walked back into a lion‚Äôs nest that I barely escaped. Stupid me. I remember the letters Kai used to write me for every month we were together, each one original and devoted to me. In one of the letters he said that I was a goddess of temptation, insanely desirable but always a little out of reach. He told me I was untouchable for I was loved and protected by the gods. Boy, did he lie. When he wanted me, I was always within reach, and he abused that privilege. He used me; he betrayed me.

My phone starts to ring again. It‚Äôs Kai. The fucking audacity on this man. I grab my phone and throw it across the room, and to my surprise, my phone stops ringing. 

‚ÄúFuck. I didn‚Äôt break it did I? I‚Äôm still paying that thing off,‚Äù I say aloud as I make my way over to check, the mug still in my hand.

There‚Äôs a crack on the screen but I can see I‚Äôm still receiving a call. I answer in annoyance,

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want?‚Äù I yell at the phone.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt really gonna put me in jail, are you?‚Äù Kai asks, over the phone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been calling?‚Äù I scoff and shake my head in disbelief. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you! Are you even concerned about me? No, I‚Äôm not gonna call the police on you. I don‚Äôt want anyone to pity me or label me a fucking victim.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, do you know if that friend of yours will keep quiet about‚Ä¶ what happened yesterday?‚Äù he asks in a hurry as if he doesn‚Äôt care what I have to say.

‚ÄúFuck you. Don‚Äôt ever contact me again,‚Äù I throw my phone back on the ground and the mug follows. I don‚Äôt care anymore.

I sigh as I kneel down to pick up the pieces of the mug, staring longingly at the piece with the angel wings stil in one piece. I beg myself not to. I can‚Äôt let him hurt me this much. I won‚Äôt let him make me hurt myself. I run my pointer finger along the edge and realize it‚Äôs too blunt. I sigh again, choosing not to spiral any further. 

I gather all the big pieces in each hand and make my way over the garbage bin. My grip tightens with every step and it starts to sting but I know they‚Äôre too dull to break skin. I throw the pieces away and look down on my hands; there are deep red (almost purple) dents where the ceramic blades were buried. I can‚Äôt take it anymore.

‚Äî
She makes her way to the kitchen. Opening a bottle of wine with great frustration, before taking a swig straight from it. Her chest starts to feel heavy and it gets harder to breathe. Danielle is no longer in control. Someone else entirely has taken over. She takes another swig and makes her way back to the bedroom. She stands in front of her bookshelf and pulls the books out, one by one, letting them pile on the ground. Some land on her feet but she does not feel them. On the second shelf she clears out, the third to the bottom on the very left, she sees the small box that contained the blades she used for self harm, years ago. She shakes as she takes them to the bathroom. 

She removes all her clothes and starts to draw a bath. 

She takes all the medication from her medicine cabinet and washes them down with the remaining half the bottle of wine before she opens the small box. She empties them out on the counter and looks at each one. Each one has a story, and holds a piece of her she swore to never look back on. She smiles in agony.
‚Äî

‚ÄúHow tragic,‚Äù I whisper to myself as I take one last look at myself in the mirror. I look a mess.

The cats are meowing and scratching at the door, as if to try and save me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry guys. Mommy is too tired. I‚Äôll miss you lots. I‚Äôll be watching over you in heaven, I promise,‚Äù I say towards the door.

My skin turns bright red as I step into the water, a fresh blade in one hand, and the rest of the wine in the other. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs water or if I‚Äôm crying but I am not sad. I feel at peace.

I finish most of the wine and whip the bottle across the bathroom. I hold up the blade in one hand and middle finger with the other, pointed at the ceiling.

‚ÄúFuck you universe, fuck you God! Peace out!‚Äù

I guess this is it. This is the end of my story.

Thank you, and good night.

I‚Äôll see you on the other side.

TLDR: I think I (26f)  upset my coworker / close friend (35f) and that she.. May be exhibiting symptoms of bipolar by ignoring me professionally and personally 


I (26f) have a colleage (35f)  who I have a crush on. But first and foremost we are close friends and she often refers to me as her best friend. Shes shy reserved and quite specific with who she chooses to spend time with. If she doesn't like you, you will know it. She doesn't really have many close friends except from me and a few others, which is what she's admitted herself.

She's 11 years older than me and has 2 young kids.

OUR relationship is weird. She's obsessive over me and gets jealous easily. Everyone constantly tells us that we should just date already. She doesn't let people  meet her kids or know anything about her life. She posts pics of me and the kids in her family group chat, I'm friends with her mother on FB. Im really close with her kids and help them with school work etc. She shares everything about her kids with me, it's like I'm a whole other parent. We go out for coffee etc and  have a flirty friendship and people are constantly telling us to 'Get together' etc. We are eachothers work soul mates and find any excuse to do things together etc even if it's something you can do yourself. 

Anyway about a year ago she told me she had a crush on a guy, and she told me after I told her about a hot girl I was becoming friends with (I'm a lesbian) which in itself was sus as she has never mentioned him before or since. I was obviously upset about this crush of hers so I confided in a friend's who then accidently name dropped the crush to X

(Let's call her X) . Understandably, X went crazy. She said she wasn't going to tell me anything every again.  I apologised, and after a week of her ignoring me both professionally and personally we got back on track. I understand why she was mad that time she confided in me and I told someone else. This I understand and we have been fine ever since. 

Before today our relationship has been amazing and we've been closer than I ever thought possible. Like in 3 years of knowing her our relationship has never been stronger. She even let's me see her kids like once a month and they ask for me all the time. She says I'm like a father to them and she is super protective of her kids. We were planning to go bowling together (again) and me just hang out with her kids. She's a little flirty with me and will call me a stupid nickname and defend me in front of people. She playfully bullies me and it's our sort of love language. Any day I'm in she will come and find me and bring me coffee. 

Until yesterday 
She told me last week about a colleages new boyfriend she told me obviously it was a odd because this colleague is married but it's no secret she loves to flaunt her latest flings, I saw this colleague  and thought she said something about her boyfriend so I asked 'Oh the columbian one?' she laughed and just went 'Oh did X tell you' I laughed and went yeah. This colleague was NOT annoyed of anything shes pretty blase about stuff like this, but then I was like oh... Was I not supposed to know... 

Ten mins later I get a text from X saying 'Why would you ask her about her boyfriend I'm not telling you anything anymore' which is the exact same wording as last time she did this

I saw her today and she blanked me. Called me by my real name instead of a nickname and kept making snarky comments and saying 'Oh do you hear someone talking' I said good morning and she stared right through me and said good morning to someone else she doesn't even like. 

She's such a red flag, I know. But I'm the only person who knows her intimately as I do. I know everything about her and she has said as much. She's terrified of being known. 

Everyone at work asked what was going on between us because they know we're eachothers shadow. She said 'NOTHING. NOTHING IS WRONG.'  everyone is asking me every day why we're literally and emotionally apart and avoiding each other. 

I feel like my entire world is ending and I don't understand what I've done. I've told her to speak this through with me like an adult and that I'm sorry I upset her. She said nothing and just grinned whilst ignoring me. She also said
.' Yes this is not the same as last time you didn't tell anyone anything.'  I told her that I know what she's like and that I know she's going to just make me guess what I've done wrong and that she is this way and that she can't surpise me because, unfortunately I know her too well. 

I'm not going to grovel or beg. That's what she wants. I don't know what to do, was our friendship even real to her? ",0,1739868440.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

	do you want this back?

	ok‚Ä¶
	i have most of your things
	in a box if you‚Äôd like to
	pick it up tomorrow?

		Sounds good. I‚Äôll see you
		then.

It‚Äôs been two weeks since my breakup with Kai. I had waited patiently, leaving all his poems and text blocks of desperation on read, to get my belongings back. It‚Äôs finally time to face him again. I send Rowan a text:

		Kai will have my things ready
		to pick up by tomorrow.

	Bout time. Do u need a
	ride?

I had gotten in a minor accident a few days prior and my car was in the shop:

		I would really appreciate it.

	No problemo. I‚Äôll pick
	you up after work then?
		
		Sounds good. :)

Rowan and I had been inseparable the past two weeks. Going on dates and spending the night at each other‚Äôs houses. Doing everything we couldn‚Äôt quite do before. Not that we hadn‚Äôt, it was just done with less guilt now. It was less thrilling. 

I hadn‚Äôt noticed how he chews with his mouth open. He wasn‚Äôt as empathetic or conscious of his surroundings as Kai. I used to admire his spontaneity and courage to try new things. Now it comes off as arrogant and clumsy.

	Dinner at my place 
	after? Chilli made w
	love sound any good?

		That sounds fantastic.

I still love spending time with him, don't get me wrong. He gets me. He sees me as I am. My identity isn‚Äôt clouded by his expectations of me or emotions towards me. Although his words are crass at times, his touch is gentle. I pick Meo up and kiss his nose, cradling him. Eggtart walks into the kitchen and starts to meow, pawing at my leg.

‚ÄúYou want attention too, huh, little guy?‚Äù I chuckle as I put Meo down.

I pour myself a cup of coffee, freshly brewed, and make my way over to the living room. I sink into the couch, resting my cup on my stomach. The kitties follow. They jump on the couch on either side of me, purring as they make themselves comfortable.

‚ÄúLots on my mind today guys,‚Äù I say to them as I sigh and take a sip. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a storm a-brewin. Can you feel it?‚Äù

‚Äî

‚ÄúHey you!‚Äù I say with a smile as Rowan walks into my apartment.

‚ÄúHey yourself! You ready to rumble?‚Äù he responds as he makes his way to the kitchen.

‚ÄúAlmost.‚Äù

I fill my travel mug with coffee and grab my coat. Time to wrap up whatever is left between me and Kai. We make our way out to the car. Kai would always open the door for me, I think to myself, as Rowan is already starting the car. We listen to his rock music, which I can barely tolerate, as we drive to Kai‚Äôs apartment. 

I walk up to the door when we arrive and ring the doorbell. I hear commotion within. Kai opens the door, breathing heavily. His face is bright, smiling wide, happy to see me. The joy wipes off his face as he sees behind me, Rowan waiting in the car, watching us.

‚ÄúDid someone drive you here?‚Äù he asks, holding back his anger.

‚ÄúYeah, just a friend. My car is in the shop,‚Äù I respond confidently.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù he says, as he continues his staring contest with Rowan.

‚ÄúMy stuff?‚Äù I wave my hand in front of his face to grab his attention.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I was hoping we could talk first?‚Äù he looks back at me, distracted.

I knew bringing Rowan might be a little cruel but it was for my protection. He‚Äôs here to be a witness if anything were to happen and an excuse to make this interaction as short and efficient as possible,

‚ÄúMy friend took time out of his day to drive me here. I really don‚Äôt wanna take any more of his time than I need to.‚Äù

His frustration starts to show on his face, jaw clenched, as he starts to breathe heavier. He grabs my wrist,

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take much of your time. Please, can you just hear me out for once?‚Äù 

He raises his voice, but as he begs and his grip tightens, I hear the car door open and close.

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù Rowan exclaims from behind me. The sound of his footsteps get closer and closer. ‚ÄúGet your filthy hands off my girl!‚Äù

‚ÄúROWAN!‚Äù I try to stop him, but it‚Äôs too late.

‚Äú‚Äòmy girl‚Äô? Are you fucking serious?‚Äù Kai releases my hand, his frustration doubled from the sense of betrayal. He‚Äôs no longer in control.

‚Äî

I see Rowan kneeling over me. I look over at Kai and see him standing in shock, his hand raised, stuck in the position where it left my face. My cheek starts to sting as I realize what just happened. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean to. I don‚Äôt know what came over me,‚Äù Kai tries to explain, glossy eyed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he starts to panic as he, himself realizes what he‚Äôs done.

Rowan jumps at him and grabs his collar,

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you, you piece of shit! I‚Äôm calling the police. I‚Äôm gonna make sure you never get the chance to lay your hand on another woman again.‚Äù

He pushes Kai back into his apartment and stands in the doorway. He pulls out his phone,

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going anywhere, you monster.‚Äù

I get up, making my way to Rowan. I grab his phone and look him in the eyes as Kai watches,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs fine, I was just shocked.‚Äù

Rowan is speechless for a moment. He looks back at Kai and thinks he sees him smirk for an instant,

‚ÄúDanielle, he‚Äôs never going to change. If you keep forgiving him and excusing his behaviour, you‚Äôre responsible for all the other people he will hurt. Don‚Äôt enable him. Don‚Äôt be an accomplice,‚Äù he wipes away the tears from my face that I hadn‚Äôt even noticed were falling, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre smarter than that.‚Äù

I hold onto his phone, my grip tightening. I know that he‚Äôs right. But, I also know that Kai is not a monster. He can‚Äôt help it. He just loses control sometimes. I look over at Kai, who‚Äôs trembling in fear, still in shock. His face is pale and his eyes are moist. He looks like a pathetic little kid, scared of the punishment that‚Äôs to come.

‚ÄúKai, I need you to grab my shit before I change my mind,‚Äù I say sternly.

‚ÄúDanielle, I‚Äôm so sorry. He‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm a monster,‚Äù Kai says, his eyes now flooding.

‚ÄúShut up. I didn‚Äôt ask for your input. Please, just go get my things.‚Äù

He opens his mouth, but realizes there‚Äôs nothing to be said. He walks into his living room to grab the box of my belongings. Rowan just watches before he turns to me and says,

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious. Danielle. You have proof of his abuse, going back months! We could put him behind bars. You could protect others from his abuse and he can never hurt you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know... I know, but I just can‚Äôt do this right now. I just want this to be over so I can go home,‚Äù I barely finish my sentence before I start to sob quietly.

Kai hands me a box, neatly packed. My clothes have been cleaned and folded; my mug is carefully placed on top. I take it and hand it over to Rowan before I pull him out of the doorway and slam the door on Kai‚Äôs face. I hear him collapse inside but I walk away. 

I get in the passenger seat and wait for Rowan to put my things in the back and get in the car. I‚Äôm no longer crying. I feel almost at peace. Completely numb and disconnected from reality. I miss my cats.

I‚Äôve already cleared my house of his belongings. All his clothes have been washed and folded; they wait patiently in a garbage bag in the back seat. A part of me had hoped that he would notice and start this conversation for me.

I tell myself once again: there is no better day. I can't keep ignoring the inevitable. I summon all the courage within me and start small,

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we need to talk...‚Äù

There it goes. There‚Äôs no turning back now.

He sets his drink down in the cup holder between us. His eyes move slowly and finally meet mine; he holds his gaze in silence. At first, he looks puzzled, then, concerned. After what feels like an eternity, he speaks almost desperately,

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like yourself today. Are you sure you don‚Äôt want to just come over and cuddle? How ‚Äòbout we talk about whatever you need when you‚Äôre feeling better? I have a feeling whatever  you think needs to be said, shouldn‚Äôt be said right now.‚Äù

For a split second I am convinced that he is right; if I waited, for a sunnier day, a more forgiving atmosphere, when all was said and done, we could pretend it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the gloomy weather encourages despair, and heightens the tension but, it needs to be said before it‚Äôs too late. Everything is prepared. It‚Äôs now or never.

	My chest tightens as my heart threatens to break out of my ribcage with every beat. I brace for impact. The words that I‚Äôve rehearsed over and over, are spoken for the last time as he moves to hold my hand. I flinch, but gather myself before I start to speak,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up with you. Please don‚Äôt make this harder for me than it has to be. I‚Äôve thought a lot the past few weeks and I‚Äôve made up my mind. Everything you had at my place is in the bag behind you. I would appreciate it if you could gather my things for me within the week and I‚Äôll pick it up next weekend.‚Äù

His hand that was hovering over mine just a second ago is now lingering uncertainly over his drink. He takes his straw and stirs the whipped cream into his already way too sweet ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù. His eyes are no longer meeting mine. He looks down to his drink. He‚Äôs trying to hide the tears forming but looking down is only making them gather faster. He takes a sip, disguising his need to swallow his tears. Carefully, he starts to speak,

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve made up your mind? You make it sound like there‚Äôs no other option‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Why didn‚Äôt you talk to me sooner?‚Äù

Before I get a chance to respond he starts to speak again, his voice trembling this time,

‚ÄúDid I do something wrong? I thought we were doing just fine. We just celebrated our anniversary. We were happy. Right? I love you, Danielle. Please don‚Äôt do this. You‚Äôre my everything.‚Äù

His sadness turns quickly into rage,

‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm not letting you break up with me. After everything we‚Äôve been through you‚Äôre just gonna give it all up?‚Äù

This time I don‚Äôt even attempt to respond, even though he pauses as if to let me speak, as I know he is not done speaking. Sure enough, he continues,

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make this harder for YOU? Why would I make this easy for you? Do you know how this makes me feel? You didn‚Äôt even warn me. You‚Äôre just breaking up with me out of the blue? Is there someone else? Is that what it is?‚Äù

This time he seems to actually want an answer. So I speak,

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre compatible and I‚Äôm done pretending in order to not be alone. There isn‚Äôt anyone else. The only person I‚Äôm choosing over you is myself. There is no fixing what doesn‚Äôt even exist. Nothing we have between us is real. You don‚Äôt actually love me for who I am and I only love the version of you I made up. I realized I don‚Äôt love you. The person I love isn‚Äôt real-‚Äù

Before I get to finish my thought he interrupts me,

‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt love me. You‚Äôve been lying to my face for over a year? Every ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôll never leave your side‚Äô was just a lie?‚Äù

He scoffs in disbelief. He is no longer reasonable, this is an argument he needs to win. This is who he is, this is why I need to leave, I think to myself but don‚Äôt dare speak it out loud. He continues,

‚ÄúNothing we have is real? The memories we made, the pictures we took, the future we painted that we were building together, those aren‚Äôt real? And what about me? I‚Äôm just a figment of your imagination?‚Äù

As he finishes his sentence he reaches over, grabs my wrist and places my hand on his chest. I feel the rough material of his shirt, his firm chest that I loved to fall asleep on underneath, and his heart beating violently within,

‚ÄúFeel how real I am. Feel my heart beat like you have a thousand times before. Is this not real? Is this also something you made up?‚Äù

His grip on my wrist tightens, it‚Äôs starting to hurt. I expected all this. He is rather predictable. This is why I decided to do this in the parking lot of this Starbucks. I need to wrap this up before I no longer have control over the situation. I remember the speech I rehearsed on my way to pick him up,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you. It‚Äôs my fault I lead you on. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I‚Äôm sorry for being selfish but it‚Äôs time for me to move on. I don‚Äôt love you anymore. I need to focus on my life and my career. I need to work on loving myself because it‚Äôs painfully clear to me now that I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

I twist out of his grip and put my hand on the steering wheel. My wrist marked where he held me. Again, nothing new. I take a deep breath and finish my prepared speech,

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask for your forgiveness. You‚Äôre allowed to hate me for as long as you need, but you will see in time that this was inevitable and the right thing to do. I‚Äôll drop you off now unless you have anything more to say or ask for closure.‚Äù

I think he realizes the reality of the situation; no amount of guilt tripping will change this outcome. Not this time. He thinks in silence, his breath heavy, and his pulse almost audible. I start to drive towards his house. A short 5 minute drive that is almost instinctive at this point. The car pulls to a stop in front of his apartment and he lets out a sigh. I start carefully,

‚ÄúOne last hug goodbye?‚Äù

He nods weakly, steps out of the car, and makes his way to my side. He opens the door and practically pulls me out as soon as I unbuckle my seatbelt. He breathes in deeply as if to bottle up my scent for future reminiscing and holds me tight. My feet hover ever so slightly above the ground, my legs dangling, my toes grazing the concrete, and I am squeezed of all air. He buries his face into my neck and I feel that his face is wet with tears. From a distance there is a thud. There is lightning, and another thud closer by. I feel a drop of rain on my forehead, and then another on my cheek. Mother nature starts to cry with him.

When he puts me down and his arms return to his side, I turn around and struggle to pull out the garbage bag from the back seat. He watches me quietly, grateful that there is now rain to hide his tears (little does he know, it is painfully clear that he is sobbing, even as I‚Äôm facing away from him). I hand him the bag and let out a quiet sigh, as I whisper,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry and thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for me this past year. You won‚Äôt be forgotten and I hope one day you can look back on this day fondly. I hope you will still cherish the memories we‚Äôve made together and I wish you the best.‚Äù

I go on my tippy toes and give him a kiss on the cheek. His face is wet with rain but I can taste the saltiness of his tears on my lips as I back away. He attempts to speak and fails a couple times before he finally says,

‚ÄúThis is it huh?‚Äù he sniffles. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you anything right now but I‚Äôll text you once I gather all your things. It might take longer than a week, I won‚Äôt lie, because it‚Äôs gonna be hard to do and I have other responsibilities. I‚Äôll definitely try to get it done as soon as possible. I know you left your glasses on the nightstand, you probably need that.‚Äù

He wipes his face of the rain (and tears), pushes back his hair and his eyes move from the top of my head to my eye brows. He looks at one eye, then the other, then my nose, my lips. He tucks my hair behind my ears and touches the diamond earings he got me for our anniversary. He tilts his head up, curses under his breath, and looks back at me.

‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want to spend the night and gather your things yourself? What if I forget something?‚Äù he says jokingly.

I chuckle softly, 

‚ÄúI should get back to my cats. You know they‚Äôre scared of thunder. They‚Äôre probably hiding under my bed waiting for me. If you forget anything I can always come pick it up, right? No hard feelings?‚Äù

I lift my hand up for a handshake. He scoffs but gives in and shakes my hand gently.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm fucking pissed, and I‚Äôm very upset, but if there‚Äôs nothing I can do, do I even have a say? I still love you and I wish we weren‚Äôt breaking up,‚Äù his voice starts to crack. He pauses to gather himself and continues,

‚Äúbut of course I want what‚Äôs best for you. Tell Eggtart and Meo I say bye, and give them warm cuddles for me,‚Äù he says, forcing a smile.

‚Äî
He turns away and walks towards his apartment, the hefty garbage bag of his things thrown over his shoulder. His silhouette is that of a homeless man, he walks defeated, his belongings stuffed in a garbage bag, his clothes soaked by the rain, but he grabs his keys with his free hand and unlocks the door to his apartment. He looks back one last time, waves to his now former lover, the girl he thought was his last, as she stands in the rain, lifting her hand ever so slightly and waving back before she turns away to get in her car. He walks into his apartment, dropping the wet bag of his belongings that probably smell like her, and closes the door. 
‚Äî

As soon as the door closes, I start to sob violently. I imagine he is also crying, with his back against the door. He always cried so pitifully, it was hard to bear at times. That‚Äôs all in the past now. 

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ Okay. It‚Äôs done. No turning back now,‚Äù I tell myself as I wipe away the tears.

I had been sitting in the idle car for about half an hour now and I figured I should get home. Eggtart is probably meowing like crazy and the neighbours had recently complained. Meo is probably destroying the bed frame like he always does when it thunders.

I feel almost intoxicated and dehydrated from the sobbing. My sight is blurry, but muscle memory gets me home safely. Kai, my now former lover, the one I thought would be my last, will be self-destructive in the coming weeks, drinking, smoking, and making mistakes that he will regret when he comes to. He will be messaging me with tempting words and poems of self reflection that are almost convincing, so I block him on all socials, and mute his phone number. I will not be persuaded and will only check his messages to know when to pick my stuff up. My heart is heavy but I feel lighter. 

I take a hot bath with a glass of wine. I replay the break up in my head as I stare at the ceiling. Overall, I think my message was delivered and we ended on far better terms than it could have. I feel cleansed, with no trace of the breakup within me as I walk out of the bathroom. Why should I be upset? I did the right thing after all.

I grab my cats and melt into bed. I plug my phone in and open the message app to new messages from Kai but they stay unopened. I instead open a chat with Rowan. I write up a text telling him about the breakup that I end up deleting. I call him instead. He answers the phone,

‚ÄúHey, how did it go? Did he cry like a little bitch?‚Äù

I chuckle,

‚ÄúOf course he did. Ugh, I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs finally over with. I had to stand in the rain cause he wouldn‚Äôt take the hint that I wanted to leave. I feel so much lighter getting rid of that ticking time bomb.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongrats, now you don‚Äôt have to worry about texting that asshole back or feel guilty about being in love with yours truly! ‚Äù Rowen says with pride.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt all bad... I got some diamond earrings out of it.‚Äù I think for a moment, trying to think of more examples, and end up drawing a blank. ‚ÄúI guess I deserved way more. These earrings alone aren‚Äôt nearly enough to compensate for my priceless time and attention I wasted on him.‚Äù I say, only half jokingly.  ‚ÄúA whole year,‚Äù I exclaim. ‚Äúof wiping his tears and listening to him whine.‚Äù

I shake my head as Rowan laughs over the phone,

‚ÄúYou were probably still nice to him until the very end. Couldn‚Äôt be me. You‚Äôre definitely a better person than I,‚Äù he says, attempting to comfort me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm too caring for my own good.‚Äù I say with a sigh.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs all over now. Finally, I can have you all for myself,‚Äù he says, smugly.

‚ÄúLucky you.‚Äù I say sarcastically. 

My eyes roll, yet a sly smile creeps up my face. I shiver under my blanket. Still cold. I hesitate briefly but say, eventually, 

‚ÄúI could use some company. Come over and cuddle. We‚Äôll read whatever desperate, cringe poems Kai thinks will fling me back into his arms.‚Äù

‚ÄúThought you‚Äôd never ask. I‚Äôll be there in 15. Mwah. Love ya!‚Äù He hangs up the phone in a hurry.

Silence consumes me. Reluctantly, I open Kai‚Äôs messages and read his poems, beautifully written stanzas of heartbreak, and overwhelming emotion and love for the goddess he describes me as. He had such a way with words. He would convince me time and time again to forgive him for all the bruises he left on my body.

I‚Äôve documented each time he left a mark on me. If I wanted to, I could reveal to the world what a monster he is. I could ruin his reputation, his life. But, I won‚Äôt. I  know I‚Äôm better than that and I won‚Äôt stoop down to his level for some petty revenge. Can you blame a girl for a little day dreaming? 

Things could‚Äôve been so much easier if he had just listened to me. We could still be together if he was as gentle with me as he was with his precious art and he showed me with his actions all the love he described to me in words. The part that angers me is that I know he was capable. He just chose not to love me properly and chose to hurt me instead. He should be thankful that I‚Äôm merciful and let him go so gently. Sometimes, I feel that I am too kind to the people that don‚Äôt deserve it. 

The doorbell rings, snapping me back to reality. I jump out of bed, practically skipping towards the door. I swing open the door, with great enthusiasm, to let Rowan in. He brought a bottle of my favourite wine and some cheese to go with it. All my doubts about the breakup vanish and are replaced with the thrill of a new lover. 

I go on my tippy toes and give him a kiss on the cheek. He blushes but I pretend not to notice as I turn to grab the wine glasses. Maybe this time, it‚Äôll make for a better story.

Later on my friend said she thought he was cute, she saw him in the bars we went to and he was checking me out. He and his friends kind of just bar hopped where we were. And I guess that‚Äôs how he showed up he came from behind me and stopped me.

I am scared, I never been approached by a conventionally attractive guy, and the texting was fine no red flags too, and usually if I get approached by guys on a night out they would want to grab drinks (bar/club) and it‚Äôs obvious it leads to sex. But he wanted to meet on Thursday for coffee.

So many things went through my head, what if he was so drunk he thought I was skinny. What if he‚Äôs a feeder or some sort of fetish. I know some guy would go for ‚Äúuglier‚Äù girls to feel better because pretty girls are ‚Äúmean/stubborn‚Äù. Maybe he‚Äôs a trainer or product seller wanted to sell me something.

I am so nervous, what if I show up and he‚Äôs disappointed, idk how I feel about this. I hate that I feel this way and am so scared if I lose this chance with this nice guy (for now).

1is89cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PDAAutism/comments/1is89cw/from_feelings_to_communicating_experience/,From feelings to communicating experience,"I wanted to talk about this idea that neurodiverse people have difficulty identifying and describing feelings. I‚Äôve heard it mentioned as a concept called alexithymia, and there are different subtypes. But what I really wanted to focus on in this post is the possibility that feelings might be different in neurodiverse people‚Äîor at least in some ways different.

What I‚Äôm noticing is that many neurodiverse people are very verbal when talking about certain ideas, plans, beliefs, or explanations. Very often, they will actually communicate a whole experience, which is why they may seem long-winded or verbose. They are trying to convey the full experience they went through, while the other person may be expecting a short, concise response. But for them, the way to communicate ‚Äòthe feeling‚Äô is through a full narrative experience.

For example, if someone asks, How is it in your current apartment? instead of replying with Oh, good or It‚Äôs a little noisy, could be better, they might describe an experience instead:

‚ÄúI have these neighbors, but when I greet them in the morning on my way to get coffee, they often don‚Äôt make eye contact. They barely have any facial expressions, and all they say is ‚Äòbonjour‚Äô sometimes. Most of them are elderly, probably in their 40s or 50s, and so on‚Ä¶‚Äù

What could have been a short, direct response instead becomes an attempt to communicate a lived experience, ensuring that everyone is on the same page‚Äîalmost as if they‚Äôre inviting the someone into their world. I‚Äôve noticed that even among neurodivergent people, when one person tells a story, others seem to almost live that experience during the storytelling.

This wouldn‚Äôt be limited to everyday conversations‚Äîit can also apply to trauma processing. I remember a situation where I was sitting with my family outside at the table one summer. I was talking with my sisters, and I was really enjoying the moment. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what we were talking about, but we were laughing, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Then, all of a sudden, my dad interrupted me out of nowhere. I was completely perplexed‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt understand how he could be so misaligned with the conversation. The first thing I noticed when I looked at him was that he already had his head down‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt making eye contact, so he couldn‚Äôt have been following the conversation that closely.

In these examples, instead of responding directly to How do you feel? or How did that make you feel?, I naturally communicate the entire experience. And it‚Äôs often only upon completing this narrative that the feeling becomes clear. If someone were to ask me to identify my feelings before I had verbally processed the experience, it would be difficult.

But maybe this isn‚Äôt true for all neurodiverse people, which is why I‚Äôm interested in hearing about others‚Äô experiences. It just seems possible that neurodiverse people inherently connect to experiences as a way of processing and expressing emotions. Even as I‚Äôm writing this post, I‚Äôm explaining my thoughts by giving an experience of talking about experiences.

Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel where I drop FREE invention ideas for the world to use. No patents, no strings attached‚Äîjust straight-up creativity. If you like what I‚Äôm doing, like and subscribe because I‚Äôve got tons more ideas coming your way!

Introducing: Smart Privacy Glasses

Ever been working on your laptop in a coffee shop, at the airport, or in a public space, and noticed people glancing at your screen? Yeah, me too. That‚Äôs why I came up with this: Smart Privacy Glasses.

These glasses work by pairing with an app on your laptop or tablet. When activated, your screen enters privacy mode, displaying a scrambled or stereogram-style image that looks like nothing but digital noise to anyone around you. But when you wear the Smart Privacy Glasses, boom‚Äîyou can see your screen clearly while everyone else sees gibberish.

How It Works:
 ‚Ä¢ Bluetooth Connection: The glasses sync to your device.
 ‚Ä¢ Screen Scrambling App: Your screen gets blurred, distorted, or layered with a stereogram image.
 ‚Ä¢ Custom Lenses: The glasses have a built-in transparent display that unscrambles the image in real-time, allowing only the wearer to see the content.
 ‚Ä¢ No More Shoulder Surfing: Perfect for anyone handling sensitive information, private messages, banking details, business presentations, or‚Ä¶ whatever else you don‚Äôt want prying eyes on.

Who Needs This?
 ‚Ä¢ Business professionals working remotely
 ‚Ä¢ Journalists & writers protecting confidential work
 ‚Ä¢ Gamers & streamers who don‚Äôt want people looking at their screens
 ‚Ä¢ Regular people who just want privacy in public

Now, if some tech company wants to take this idea and patent it‚Äîcool, but you better pay me at least 20% in royalties! Otherwise, this one‚Äôs free but if make some cash on it remember who gave you the idea and pay some cash forward (Please and Thank you)

If you love crazy new ideas like this, subscribe to my channel because I drop innovative, original concepts all the time. Take them, build them, or just be inspired.

Let me know what you think in the comments! Would you buy Smart Privacy Glasses? What features would you add? Hit like, subscribe, and I‚Äôll see you in the next one! YouTube channel link. https://www.youtube.com/@marcuswinston2522

I've checked all I could and everything seems fine. I can hear the infuser going up and down with no effort, the lower end switch gets triggered and then it moves up and I'm pretty sure the issue is there somewhere since that's when the light lights up. That said I've tear it down and check all the end switch and they're all perfectly clean and working fine. (I couldn't understand how the top end switch is supposed to get triggered though since it's installed behind the brew piston).

Transmission looks fine too, no wiggle or anything and I keep it lubed with vaseline.

And do you notice a beneficial effect with the addition of caffeine/coffee?,"Elvanse has been a life-changing medication for me. Although I respond to methylphenidate, Elvanse (a prodrug to the r-enantiomer of amphetamine, dexamphetamine) just reaches places in my being that bring me into a state of rest yet focus. I can usually sense the effects (onset of action) start to kick in around 30-45 minutes after ingestion. I take mine in a solution of water, on an empty stomach, so maybe that's one reason why (yes, this is allowed; read the package insert üòâ). 

Having said that, unless I get a good sleep, Elvanse isn't very therapeutically effective. As ADHDers, most of us aren't unfamiliar with poor sleep. On this note, I've found that coffee can be a real blessing, not just after a poor night's sleep, but also when the therapeutic effects of Elvanse start to wear off. The only problem is that taking caffeine too late in the afternoon can have residual effects that reinforce the cycle of poor sleep. I guess it's a matter of balance. I also make sure to get enough electrolytes, salt in water, and nutritious food into my body on a daily basis (caffeine, as a diuretic, can lead to the loss of electrolytes, leaving you fatigued and crashing hard, and when you add on Elvanse, which seems to be quite hard on magnesium, it can be a disaster). If you don't eat well, especially protein, and fail to keep yourself properly hydrated i.e. with electrolytes and water as opposed to water alone, you are going to wear yourself out pretty quickly, and you'll start to think that your medication has lost its efficacy.

As for caffeine, its effects are slightly similar to Elvanse, in some regards, and different in others. I find it works much better at waking me up when used in conjunction with Elvanse; but alone it makes me sleepy. I do need to be careful though as too much caffeine intake, especially alongside Elvanse, isn't good for the cardiovascular system, and especially if you really struggle with sleep. 

What are your experiences? Did you self-medicate with caffeine/coffee before getting an ADHD diagnosis? Feel free to say anything relevant on the subject üôè  

Note: I use caffeine/coffee to refer to coffee, caffeine pills, etc., so not just coffee, and not including decaff coffee (although it can still have up to 30% of caffeine in it). ",4,1739867337.0,ADHDUK,10,0.75,False

1is7za5,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1is7za5/king_baby_and_their_royal_servants_mom_and_dad/,"King Baby and their royal servants, Mom and Dad","This is a story from a couple months ago that happened to me while working, and oh boy is it a doosy.

I work in a local bakery / sandwich shop and we once had a couple bring in their baby. Most people will either bring a stroller or just hold their baby while they eat because we dont have any highchairs, but instead of doing that they spent the entire time (around 20 mins) following the baby around the shop, while carrying their plates of food with then instead of sitting down. The baby was aproaching other guests tables as they were eating and the parents just stood and watched as the people eating were looking at them confused and annoyed.

Its important to note that at the time it was only me and two other people working. My boss was the only baker so he was busy making dough and my other coworker was taking lunch so the only person who was watching this happen was me.

Back to the story, eventually the baby made its way over to the front door, and instead of picking the baby up the parents opened the door to let the baby crawl outside and towards the road, and only stopped it when it was CRAWLING OFF THE CURB INTO THE ROAD. They then proceded to follow it down the sidewalk out of sight of the windows, all the while *still holding and eating their plates of food*.That was bad enough but what happened next was just gross.

We have a display filled with merchandice, including a bunch of coffee cups in boxes. After eventually bringing the baby inside it crawled right up to the display and grabbed one of the boxes. The parents did actually take it from the baby, but instead of putting it back they carefully opened the box, took the paper padding out of the box, took the cup out, then *gave it to the baby* at which point the baby started *LICKING ALL OVER THE CUP AND PUTTING IT IN HIS MOUTH.* I was genuinely dumbfounded and just watched as the parents proceeded to *put the cup back in the box, put the paper back in the box, close the box, and PUT IT BACK ON THE DISPLAY WITH THE REST OF THE CUPS.*

They put an unwashed, dirty, slobbery, baby spit covered cup back into the box and put it on the shelf for some poor unsuspecting soul to buy and use. They did not even mention the dirty cup, just silently put it back on the shelf.

I immediately told my boss about what i saw and him being the thoughtfull ""always seeing the best in people"" person that he is, could not beleive somebody would do something so stupid and unhygienic, asking if i was sure i saw it correctly. That was, until he walked over to the front and saw what was happening himself.

Some more context; we had a broken espresso machine my boss was trying to fix for use in the bakery. Due to the small size of the building we didnt have enough counter space for him to work on it in the back, so he opted to use one of the tables in the front of the restaurant as a workbench. Whenever we opened he just put the espresso machine and tools into a box and set them in the corner against the wall where they were less noticeable, and put a paper note on it saying not to touch it. 

If you ever opened up an espresso machine then you know that there are a lot of metal peices, delicate circuitry, and wires inside, so imagine his suprise when he looks into the dining area to see a baby *chewing on some exposed wires of said espresso machine while the parents just watched.*

He immediately walked over and told them they could not stay if they could not control their child in about the most polite a way possible. To their credit, they did stop the baby from chewing on the wires and apologized (the baby didnt damage it or get hurt luckily). My boss didnt kick them out because he only saw the baby chewing wires and didnt want to make a scene as they were finishing their food already. Im sure he regretted that decision when he returned to behind the counter and turned around to see, as both me and him were watching in plain view, *THE MOM TAKE A DIFFERENT CUP OFF THE SHELF, OPEN IT, AND GIVE IT TO THE BABY WHO IMMEDIATELY BAGAN LICKING IT AGAIN.*

The look on my bosses face could only be described as a mix of disgust, confusion and dissapointment all at once. My boss didnt even react at first and just watched for what felt like hours but was in reality only a couple seconds before the mom *once again* put the cup back in the box and put it back on the shelf.

Ive never seen my boss look so defeated in his life as that moment. He immediately walked over, took the cup off the shelf and told them they had to pay for it. The parents both laughed and asked if he was joking, as though we didnt just see a baby treat it like it was a spitoon. They did end up paying for it but the entire time they were being rung up the mom kept asking why it was such a big deal while the father just stared daggers at my boss.

 They left immediately after with no other issues, leaving both me and my boss absolutely bewildered. It was only then that i remember that that wasnt the only cup the baby was allowed to defile, so i quickly grabbed the box and gave it to my boss, who immediately turned around and tossed it in the garbage without a word.

Since then they have not returned, but we did notice a couple days later that there was a one star review posted the same day that simply read, ""not child freindly.""",2,1739866966.0,entitledparents,0,0.75,False

This post will be an in-depth, humble opinions of the perfumes by the brand ""Muse Beauty"". I do have a ""lawwwt"" to share and I hope I'll able to hold on to your attention until the end. 

‚ô§ A little side note ‚ô§ - 

I would kindly request you not to downvote this post because I know this brand's a little controversial here so I'll be sharing all my own humble opinions from a fragnoob's perspectiveüòäüíô. We all know how each and every one of us perceives a scent differently than others. So, what I dislike in a scent may be enjoyed by you, and vice versa. So this will be my own experience with the brand's perfumes. I would love it if you could share your experiences in the comment section if you've bought anything from themü§åüèºüôèüôå. 

‚ôß A Backstory ‚ôß - 

I came across this brand called Muse Beauty during the last September via Instagram. I decided to pull the trigger and bought a few of their stuffs. I bought two of their 15 mls - The Caramel Pistachio(CP) and the Espresso Vanilla(EV). Both of them to my nose were pretty solid and linear perfumes and I could see myself wearing EV as my daily scent(I didn't want to splurge more than 1000 rupees on my daily perfume). I ordered their first two discovery sets - they were kind of promising(a few good, a few meh and a few bad) but I felt there was more room for improvement. My mother ended up liking Cinnamon Apple Pie(CAP) along with EV. So those two were in my wishlist back in October 2024. 

Fast forward to December 2024 I saw something was wrong with CP since the smell of alcohol was stronger than ever, rivaling the smell of the Plum's Alcohol Vibes(sorry Vanilla Vibes!üòî). Also, the atomizers were really bad. Eventually I had to decant EV since it's atomizer completely stopped working. I was really looking forward to buy a full bottle of EV as my daily scent and CAP for my mother. But I didn't buy any of them because the atomizer thing kind of irked me in the first placeüò™. 

Fast forward to January(2025), I noticed something was amiss with EV. Those who have it, they know that it's not a coffee scent at all, when I first sprayed it back in September I did get some coffee but it was basically a pear-jasmine-nutty concoction(atleast on me) and it wasn't really headache inducing and a pretty good blend. Mind you that was my first impressions. Anyway, back to January, I noticed that the coffee situation was nowhere to be sniffed and now it's a predominant orange blossom-pear-jasmine-nutty perfume with a blast of alcohol. And it started to cause a headache which wasn't happening at all last year when I first got it. This is the 15ml I'm talking about. I did have a little amount of the 5ml discovery set one tucked in my vanity so that I can actually compare. And as what happened with the Caramel Pistachio same happened with EV! üò¨I still got that whiff of subtle coffee from the 5ml one and it smelled the exactly the same when I first bought it and it didn't even induce any headacheüòÆ! Hence, the thing is - the 5ml discovery set scents remained intact but the 15 mls changed. 

I wanted to double check the EV with a bigger bottle so I came across their website just to see that they launched more variants. I was contemplating whether to buy the EV or the newer ones. So I finally decided to go for the newer ones to see if there are any improvements with their scent profiles and performance before I put the brand away both from my mind and vanityüòê. So I bought the 3rd and 4th discovery sets. After testing them I ended up buying a 50 ml of Vanilla Candy for my mother. I wanted the Mocha Caramel Martini for myself but I don't want to buy the 50 ml and the 30ml is out of stock. So for the time being, I bought the Vanilla Candy for my mom to basically observe any changes. And I really didn't have to wait for long because there's definitely something fishy about the 50 ml bottle which I noticed the moment I received itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But before I point out the differences, let me first review the 5 mls from the discovery sets one by one. 

‚òÜ In-depth reviews of the 3rd and 4th discovery sets ‚òÜ - 

‚ñ† DISCOVERY SET 3 - 

1. MOCHA CARAMEL MARTINI - 

‚óá Notes : Dark Chocolate, Roasted Coffee, Caramelized Cane Sugar, Sweet Cream and Bitter Almonds. 

‚óá What am I actually smelling : The first spray is giving me - Margo neem soap + dash of bitter coffee + sprinkle of bitter almonds + roasted sauf + Dabur daant manjan tooth powder. As it dries down, the bitter almonds becomes a little too prominent on my skin as if I have made a paste of almonds and coated the coffee beans with them and sprinkled Dabur Daant manjan powder and roasted sauf on top. 

‚óá Remarks : When I first sprayed this, I judged it way too quickly. The scent itself is pretty good actually the kind of scent I usually like to reach out for. But this is absolutely NOT a sweet gourmand! Which is a good thing for me who doesn't like sweet gourmands but for the people who are expecting it to be a sweet chocolatey coffee gourmand....they will be disappointed as fudge! The dark chocolate didn't really show up on my skin. The main issue is with the longevity. Shit doesn't stay on my skin for even 3 hrs.

‚óá Performance : 2-2.5 hrs on skin, 7-8 hrs on clothes. After the 1st hr I have to sniff the soul out of them to actually get the scent but it is sitting somewhat close to my skin. 

‚óá Full bottle worthy - I would have gotten the 30 ml but it's out of stock. I'll probably buy a 30 ml if they bring it back in stock. Because even though the scent is good, the longevity is kind of stopping me to even buy a 30 ml. 

2. PASSION ELIXIR - 

‚óá Notes : Pear, Tuberose, Orange Blossom, Vanilla, Patchouli and Vetiver 

‚óá What am I actually smelling : The opening is the generic pear and tuberose concoction veering straight into agarbatti direction. The vetiver and the patchouli joins in and making it more of a grounding or let's just say an earthy scent. This smells like I have opened the seal of a box of agarbattis and took a few of them out and rubbed them in my hands. 

‚óá Remarks : Obviously it's not for me, and I am a picky person when it comes to florals and tuberose is one such floral that has always given me a hard time (except a few) since most of the time it gives agarbatti or the liquids in the mosquito repellent machine vibes on my skin. This is for the people who loves their floral scents to death. Those who have motion sickness, avoid this one in the car. 

‚óá Performance : 10 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. This one projects for a while. After the 5th hr, I start smelling like those vintage floral perfumes. 

‚óá Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

3. SCANDALOUS HONEY - 

‚óá Notes : Blood orange, Honey, White florals, Peaches, Beewax, Caramel and Patchouli 

‚óá What am I actually smelling : The first spray to my nose - A glass of orange squash with lots of Candied orange peels and two tea spoons of Honeytus cough syrup added to it and someone sprayed their white floral air freshner in the background. Something in this is very reminiscent of EV maybe the white florals but something in the mid note smells very similar. 

‚óá Remarks : This perfume smells.....juicy. Like you have a very juicy fruit in your hand and you just bite down into it. I get no caramel here but definitely some sweet peaches. Not for me atleast. 

‚óá Performance : 4.5-5 hrs on skin. Almost the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it becomes a soapy orangey scent. 

‚óá Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

4. VANILLA CANDY 

‚óá Notes : Black currant, Green Tangerine, Strawberry Fizz Candy, Vanilla and Sandalwood 

‚óá What am I actually smelling : The opening is giving me strawberry and orange stretchy and chewy sugared candies or those multicolored sugared gummies with a lot of coconut shavings sprinkled on the top. And also something about it smells like those barbie doll scent in the dry down and something shampoo-ish. 

‚óá Remarks : Mind it that this impression is solely about the 5ml one NOT THE 50ml ONE! It's playful, airy all pink and purple vibes. As a certified sweet gourmand avoider, I really appreciate the scent because it's not exactly cloyingly sweet and simultaneously it has able to capture the stretchy chewy sugared candies scent. The dry down is pretty decent maybe a tad bit plasticky but nothing too much. This one's a pretty solid one! My mother liked this one on me, she said that I smell like those laal sugared chewy gummies. She sprayed it on her wrist and made an expression that basically meant - ""Order one for me please"". So yeah I ordered this one for her. 

‚óá Performance : 7-8 hrs on skin and entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it becomes more of a coconutty vanilla scent. 

‚óá Repurchase worthy : Nope. I have mentioned my reasons down below. 

5. WHIPPED CREAM PISTACHIO - 

‚óá Notes : Pistachios, Whipped cream, Fizzy cotton candy, Fluffy marshmallows, Roasted Hazelnuts, Jasmine, Vanilla and Cacao 

‚óá What am I actually smelling : So you have Khair Pistachio, take the geranium and the creaminess(smells very essential oily) in it and amp it up a notch and also the not-so-prominent pistachios comes right in, which I didn't get immediately neither from Khair nor from Affection(lattafa). The dry down becomes baby wipe-ish mixed with talc turning off-putting to my nose just like what happened with Affection Lattafa. 

‚óá Remarks : This was really close to replace KP for me, if not for it's shortlived performance and the disappointing dry down. Despite the burst of that geranium scent in the opening, it immediately starts mellowing down to a more creamy accord with a few pistachios but atleast this one smells like it has pistachio. Also this one smells really good in the air. I sprayed it in my room. Went to the other room and came back after 30 mins or so and I was pleasantly surprised how good my room was smelling. The green essential oil-ish aromatic note in the beginning definitely is calming when in air but the moment you sniff it from your hands or any strip, it is sharp and punchy as puck. 

‚óá Performance : 3 hrs on skin and 8-9 hrs on clothes. After 2nd hr, it's just something baby wipe-ish and something talcum-y. 

‚óá Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

‚ñ† DISCOVERY SET 4 - 

1. APPLE OF EDEN 

‚ô§ Notes : Juicy apples, Pink Grapefruit, Wild Berries, Raspberry Blooms, Jasmine and Sugary Vanilla. 

‚ô§ What am I actually smelling : This starts with your typical designer scent profile. But here's the thing it is the generic-mall-section-designer. It is kind of tart, very apple-isque and way too many berries, way too much of a perfumed fruity cocktail. This is also giving me BBW and VS mist vibes but stronger. 

‚ô§ Remarks : This is the scent I get the moment I step into the perfume section in the mall. Very mass pleasing. If you're someone who loves a fruity berry scent, you can give this one a try. 

‚ô§ Performance : 6-7 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes 

‚ô§ Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

2. LEMON POUND CAKE - 

‚ô§ Notes : Candied lemons, Panacotta, Sweet rum and Vanilla 

‚ô§ What am I actually smelling : It's the yellow Lizol in the opening or any citrusy cleaning liquid. As it starts drying down I am getting sugary lemon peels and unfortunately a prominent pan masala scent. 

‚ô§ Remarks : This to me doesn't smell like a cake. Yes maybe some lemon candy but not cake. Maybe the garnish on the top of the cake. 

‚ô§ Performance : 4-4.5 hrs on skin. I'm pretty much impressed by it's performance on skin especially given it is a citrus scent since citrus notes don't last too long on skin. 10 hrs on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it's giving me mitha paan with sugared lemon peels inside it. 

‚ô§ Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

3. S'MORES BY THE FIREPLACE - 

‚ô§ Notes : Toasted marshmallows, Pink pepper, Orange blossom, Roasted chestnuts, Juniper, Vanilla and Cashmere 

‚ô§ What am I actually smelling : This lowkey smells like henna powder mixed with a sac full of roasted cloves! 

‚ô§ Remarks : The sharp and piercing opening is kind of off-putting. But after waiting for 10-15 minutes, I do enjoy the predominant roasted clove scent - the kind of scent you get when you heat up cloves on a tawa and also the smell of henna powder. As much as I love the scent of cloves here but there is no ""character"" to this perfume like neither my skin nor my clothes are able to pick up any proper base. It's just lacking a base. The dry down gets a little pine-y, aromatic, powdery and reminiscent of Dabur Daant Manjan toothpowder on both my skin and clothes. 

‚ô§ Performance : 6-7 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. But after the 1st hr, it literally becomes a skin scent and I have to sniff the soul out of my skin and cloth to actually get the scent. 

‚ô§ Full bottle worthy : Unfortunately nope. This one could have been a really good scent to be honest unfortunately it just lacks something like a base. 

4. VANILLA GODDESS - 

‚ô§ Notes : Vanilla, Bright lavender, Cacao, Ginger root, Vanilla caviar and Vanilla absolute 

‚ô§ What am I actually smelling : The opening is giving me Lavender bath and body products. This scent can be a really good scent for the vaporizer. As it starts to dry down, this gradually veers into mosquito repellent category! 

‚ô§ Remarks : I really wanted to love this. Especially the opening is very calming. I'll probably spray the 5 ml on my pillow. It's airy and predominantly lavender and a little gingery. But the moment it starts drying down, things go south. It really reminds me of some kind all-out or goodnight advanced! 

‚ô§ Performance : 4-5 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it's just repellent on my clothes but on my skin the vanilla becomes a little more prominent. 

‚ô§ Full bottle worthy : Nope. This was the one that I really wanted a bottle of due to the opening but unfortunately I am very disappointed with the dry down. 

5. VANILLA PARADOXE - 

‚ô§ Notes : Pear, Tangerine, Orange blossom, Neroli, Jasmine, Bourbon vanilla and Musk 

‚ô§ What am I actually smelling : The opening is - fragrant citrusy floral perfume sprayed over a glass of mixed fruit squash. This is a pear-jasmine dominant scent. 20 mins in and it's giving something tart and agarbatti. 

‚ô§ Remarks : It's airy and fresh. I'll say the agarbatti situation here is much more tolerable than Passion Elixir maybe due to the lack of tuberose here but the tuberose is replaced by the jasmine and it's a little bit more subtle to my nose. But...this scent isn't for the cars. 

‚ô§ Performance : 5-5.5 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, the musk becomes a little too prominent on my skin but my clothes still holds that jasmine accord. 

‚ô§ Full bottle worthy : Nope. 

ü§î The Differences between the 5ml vs the 15/50ml ü§î

üëâüèº Even though I believe that color is NOT really a good indicator of the integrity of a fragrance, you can see there is a visible difference in the color of the juices from the second picture. The Caramel pistachio(15ml) from it's previous launch turned two shades deeper and more alcoholic but the one in the 5ml discovery set remained intact both in terms of colour and scent. At the same time, the 15ml Espresso Vanille didn't change any color but the perfume has almost altered itself to a headache inducing predominantly floral scent. 

üëâüèº Unfortunately the 50ml bottle of Vanilla Candy opens into this sharp plasticky note almost reminiscent to a barbie doll head. And that note remains like that for an hour. After an hour it finally starts drying down to the sugared gummies scent. The barbie doll scent that I was getting in the 5ml is amped up to 100 times in the 50 ml turning it into straight up plasticky but I didn't get any alcohol blast from this. When the scent is in it's middle accords, that's when it gets better otherwise there is this stark difference in the opening of the scents in the two bottles. 

‚óè To conclude (ONLY from the perfume perspective) : 

ü§î I personally feel like, their ""gourmand"" scents are not exactly gourmand-ish which is a good thing for people like me who don't really incline towards gourmands but will be a huge disappointment for the sweet gourmand enthusiasts. 

ü§î The performance of the scents could be improved. 

ü§î This brand should take a serious look into the batch variation issue. Apart from the Caramel Pistachio and Espresso Vanille from the first launch, I've read a few reviews where the customers couldn't smell anything other than the alcohol in Cinnamon Apple Pie while I couldn't smell no alcohol in CAP from the discovery set which maybe due to the fact I was smelling it from the 5ml sample (50% perfume oil concentration) and not from the 30 or 50ml where they use lesser concentration of the perfume oil (25%). A few of their customers enjoyed a particular scent from them earlier during their launch while the others were smelling straight up alcohol. Which also is the same case with CAP for me. I've seen two kinds of post in this community regarding CAP where half of them said that they just smelled alcohol while the other half didn't get any alcohol and loved the scent.


Thank you for reading till the end! Hope this helps!‚ù§ I feel like this brand had a lot of potential atleast when I first saw it's initial launches last year but unfortunately it has been just struggling to gain the foothold.",21,1739866905.0,desifemfrag,9,0.87,False

Hey there!  

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old from Punjab, currently living in Italy‚Äîbecause apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we‚Äôll probably get along great. If not, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won‚Äôt argue. Probably.  

So if you‚Äôre up for a chat‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport‚Äîdrop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who‚Äôs down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

She was tired, running on survival mode, always trying to be everything for everyone. She didn't know yet that peace wasn‚Äôt something she had to earn‚Äîit was something she deserved.

She asked me if she ever found a place to call home. I smiled and told her, ""Yes, and not just any home‚Äîthe one you dreamed of, with land, space, and love. You‚Äôre building a life that finally feels like yours.""

She asked if she was happy. I told her happiness didn‚Äôt come all at once, but in small moments‚Äîbaking in the winter, watching her daughter grow, feeling the love of a partner who truly sees her.

She asked if the loneliness ever stopped hurting. I told her she would find comfort in stillness, in her own strength. And that missing her daughter when she‚Äôs away won‚Äôt get easier, but the love they share will always be enough to bridge the distance of 50/50.

She asked if love ever felt safe again. I told her, ""Yes. It‚Äôs steady now. No more second-guessing, no more losing yourself to prove you're enough. You are loved for exactly who you are.

I hate that I've been through so much. This highlighted my hurts. But thankfully I'm okay now. Sometimes the sadness creeps in but I am grateful for my now ‚ù§Ô∏è if you're struggling,  please know, it can and will get better. ",13,1739866637.0,selflove,3,1.0,False

i mixed a full scoop into my morning coffee, and at first, i found the taste a bit bitter. after a few days, i started experimenting by blending it with almond milk and even adding some strawberries. that adjustment really improved the flavor for me, making it much more enjoyable.

i did notice a slight boost in energy and felt less hungry throughout the morning. however, it's clear that it's not a magic pill ‚Äì you still have to stick to a low-carb diet and manage your overall food intake. overall, i'm cautiously positive about keto activate as a supplement, but it‚Äôs definitely most effective when combined with a strict keto diet.

Just venting on my latte making frustration!
I am probably making it hard for myself. 
I only make 120ml of milk as that is all I need. I am only making a flat white in an Italian size cup (around 160mlcup)

I have 2 different jugs with different shapes (and they do behave differently). They are the 350ml. See pics.
Since I moved from my slow steaming of the Gaggia Evolution which had good constant steam but not strong to the Gaggia E24 which is much much stronger steam my latte is a disaster. The Evolution took like 45 seconds and I had plenty of time for all the tips from videos... My milk was actually good! But on the E24...no more!

I have bought the Shade of coffee the 1 hole... And it seemed better but it is very inconsistent. Almost tempted to try again the 2 holes and try to perfect that.

The main issue is that on the 120ml it happens soooo fast I have no time to get a proper vortex. I can't see the tip as in 1 second it is disappearing. The milk grows so fast that I can't move it fast enough. In 6 seconds is all over. 
I might just about get the paper rips for 1 seconds and then by the time I am adjusting the pitcher it's hot. Mostly I get too much air in...20% Of the time not enough Ahah! If I submerged at the beginning too much then if I move it to the paper rip sound then I still have no time to incorporate.
Before you say... ah the Gaggia has not enough steam... you need a PID... I went to a latte art course and they let me loose on a commercial Marzocco (had maybe 10ngoes) and i did not get the latte right ever!! The instructor obviously got it every time! Same issue ... On smaller quantities (she was trying to make me practice on my amount) it just happened so fast none of the video tips worked... The angle... Move the jug after the stretching etc... There is just no time for anything! The milk also moves so violently in the jug...

Besides doubling the milk and resign myself to throwing away milk ... Any tip?! Is it even possible to get good latte on a small quantity?

I will continue to practice on water and soap... But if anyone has any tip on small amount please send it my way!!",2,1739866444.0,gaggiaclassic,19,0.75,False
1is7uzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockholm/comments/1is7uzd/shih_bost√§der/,SHIH Bost√§der,"(Posting with a throwaway account for obvious reasons)

I immigrated to Sweden 10 years ago, to live with my Swedish boyfriend.  He‚Äôs been psychologically, mentally, and financially abused to me for years, to the point that I haven‚Äôt been ‚Äùpermitted‚Äù to learn spoken/written Swedish properly, or to have money saved.  He‚Äôs also an alcoholic.  He‚Äôs never been physically abusive, but he‚Äôs threatened to kill my cats when he‚Äôs been in a drunken rage.  I desperately want to leave my situation, but I feel financially trapped.

I found a website called SHIS Bost√§der, and it says they help with affordable, transitional housing for short-term use.  I think that‚Äôs exactly what I need; I know I‚Äôll be able to support myself once I‚Äôm out of my current situation.  Does anyone know how I can ‚Äùaccess‚Äù SHIS?  I‚Äôve emailed them, but haven‚Äôt had a reply.  I think I need a referral from a social worker, but I‚Äôm not sure if that comes from my doctor, my psychologist, etc.  I‚Äôm 59 years old, and have a ‚ÄùS√§llsynta h√§lsotillst√•nd‚Äù registered with Socialstyrelsen, but I‚Äôm still able to live independently right now (my disease progresses similarly to ALS, but more slowly). 

I understand that there are refugees and asylum seekers who have a worse life than me.  It is technically possible for me to return to my original home in North America, but I truly love Sweden.  I love the quiet people, the nature, the public transportation, and the medical system which has diagnosed and treated my rare disease. I want to stay here, and to continue contributing.  I just want to wake up in the morning, have a peaceful cup of coffee with my cats, and go to my job.  I just want to live in peace.
