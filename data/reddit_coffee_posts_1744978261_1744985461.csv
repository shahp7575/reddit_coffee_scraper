It’s just before two on a warm afternoon and I’ve got the house to myself. Peyton and Eva are in school, Dawn’s out shopping with friends, and I’m in the living room hunched over the laptop rubbing my temples.

I’ve spent the last five hours scouring job sites online and sending follow-up emails to the long list of prospective employers who have been ignoring me. Although each message is essentially the same, I type them out individually rather than copying and pasting, as if doing it the hard way will somehow increase my chances of finding a job: *“Hello, I’m Louis Springfield. I submitted my resume recently, and am circling back …”*

The house is a mess—crumbs on the carpet, dirty dishes in the sink—but I didn’t clean up this morning like I usually do when I get home after driving the girls to school. Instead, I immediately dove into the employment search and haven’t stopped since, not even getting up to use the bathroom. So far today, I’ve had exactly one sniff—a small tech company said a representative would be contacting me sometime between seven and eight this evening for a brief screening interview on Zoom. Those screening interviews usually go nowhere, although it’s the closest thing I’ve had to a lead in ages. It’s something, at least.

I’ve been more motivated than ever to find work since Jeff showed up out of the blue last week throwing his money around. It’s embarrassing—I’m supposed to be the breadwinner, goddamn it.

Still, while I hate to admit it, the cocky sonofabitch has been a lifesaver. On his first visit, when he sent me to the store to buy whiskey and beer, he handed me a pair of hundred-dollar bills and told me to keep the change. The “change” turned out to be almost ninety bucks, enough to pay the balance on the water bill. And after dinner last night, just before he took off, he handed Dawn a cool grand in cash—ten crisp Benjamins. “To help you catch up a little,” he said, and my wife fell all over herself thanking him. She demanded that I thank him, too, and I complied through clenched teeth. Melissa noticed my humiliation and snorted into her wine goblet.

After Jeff and Melissa left the house last night, Dawn had me drive to the ATM and deposit the thousand dollars in our account so I could immediately pay the past-due heating and electric bills online. I took care of it before I went to bed, and it’s a huge weight lifted—but now the mortgage payment is due soon, and I don’t have anywhere near enough money in the account to cover it. I hate that I’m already counting on Jeff to come through and pay it for us. Damn it, I don’t want him paying for everything. I need to be the one who provides for Dawn. I’m her husband. Right?

Shit, I don’t even know anymore. The way she gazes at him. How he openly flirts back, right in my goddamn face. The man obviously has no respect for me, and I really can’t say I blame him, since I allow myself to be treated this way. Why should he respect me when I won’t stand up for myself? I’m still hurting from the question Melissa asked me at dinner last night, while Jeff was rubbing Dawn’s shoulder and reminiscing about their relationship: “Damn, Lou, you gonna let another man make a play for your wife like that?” The trailer-trash bitch only asked it to stir things up, like she always does. But it was a legitimate question—and everyone in the room knew the answer.

Dawn has openly screwed around on me for years, and I’ve accepted it with a smile. I mean, she had me working at her lover’s hardware store a few weeks ago before she broke up with him, for chrissakes. From the very beginning of this marriage, she’s flaunted her flings in my face. But it’s different with Jeff. Those other guys are just square jaws, biceps and big dicks. But as my wife told Peyton and Eva at supper last night, she and their father had “something special”—and from the sparks I’ve seen them generate when they’re together, it’s obvious they still do.

I refocus on my laptop and click on monster-dot-com. Maybe a new listing has been posted since I last visited the site forty minutes ago. If so, I’ll be among the first to submit a resume.

Ugh. Dick. I check my email again. Nada.

The front door rattles open and Dawn strides in gripping a Gucci bag in each hand. I gasp out loud—why is she shopping at such an expensive store when money is so tight? She chuckles when she notices me staring at the bags.

“Don’t worry—Jeff gave me his Visa Platinum card,” she explains, her lips and nostrils twitching, as if she’s daring me to fight for my dignity.

Blinking, I try to recall when Jeff gave her a credit card last night. Was it while I was cooking dinner? It couldn’t have been. I can see and hear everything from the kitchen.

Dawn reads my mind. “He met us at the mall for lunch,” she informs me with a delighted sigh. “Melissa told him I didn’t have much money on me, and he reaches in his wallet and hands me his goddamn Platinum card. He told me to buy whatever I wanted so I went to Gucci. It’s been ages.”

“Oh, wow. That’s, um … that’s great, hon. You … you always liked shopping at Gucci.” It’s a stupid thing to say, I know. But it’s all I can conjure up.

Dawn sets the bags on the coffee table and glances to and fro, her nose crinkled. “What the hell, Lou—this place is a goddamn pigsty.”

“Oh, yeah, sorry, I was gonna get to it soon. The girls have soccer practice after school, so I don’t have to pick them up until five. I’ve been online all day looking for a job—and, um, I got a Zoom interview tonight with Marl Industries, this place out of Fresno; they’re supposed to call between seven and eight. It might turn into something.”

“Hm, maybe it will.” Dawn smacks her lips. “But you need to hurry up and get this damn house clean—Jeff’s on his way over; he’ll be here in a few minutes.”

If this was a normal marriage, I would be perfectly within my rights to ask my wife why her ex is visiting when his daughters won’t be home for hours—but in our dysfunctional relationship that would be a huge mistake. I have a sinking feeling I don’t want to know why the asshole is coming over, anyway. So, instead of manning up and asking a perfectly legitimate question, I nod, sigh, close my laptop, and amble to the dining room table, where I methodically start picking up the dirty dishes and cups from breakfast.

Dawn huffs and throws up her hands. “Can you pull the stick out of your ass, Lou, and hurry up? I just told you he’s on the way. He’ll be here in a few minutes—I don’t want him seeing this mess.”

“Okay, okay, I’m hurrying,” I reply in a pained voice—the closest thing to rebellion I’m able to muster.

After checking herself in the hallway mirror and fluffing her hair, Dawn strolls to the couch, scoops up the remote and starts channel-surfing. As she chills and watches the tube, I clean up around her at the quick-step before starting on the kitchen.

I’m leaning over the sink, elbows-deep in hot, sudsy water when the front door rattles open, followed by Dawn’s cheery, “Hey, you.”

I crane my neck and watch with a lump my throat as Jeff strides into my home like he owns the damn place. He leans down and kisses Dawn on the mouth before straightening up and waving at me with his fingertips. “Hey, there, Louie,” he calls with a wink. “Doin’ the dishes, eh? You’re always such a busy little guy, ain’t ya?”

“He wasn’t busy this morning; that’s why this place is a mess still,” Dawn snarls as her ex sits next to her on the sofa.

“Aw, Louie, what’s wrong—ain’t you taking care of your husbandly duties?” Jeff brays toward the kitchen.

Dawn snorts. “Them ain’t the only husbandly duties he ain’t taking care of.”

Jeff smacks his forehead. “Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmnnn!!” He pushes his hair back. “That’s cold. Louie! How do you put up with that shit?”

The cotton in my mouth prevents me from replying, even if I wanted to, and I don’t want to. Dawn answers for me.

“Lou knows the deal,” she says with a leer. “I do what I want to do, and see who I want to see.”

“So, you guys got one of them open marriages?” Jeff smirks. “Are you two, like, swingers or something?”

My wife sniffs. “I don’t know how he could be a swinger when his little dick don’t work.”

Amid Jeff’s howls, I close my eyes and explode.

“Man, what the fuck!” I flail my arms like a madman. “What the FUCK, DAWN!???”

“What?” She lights a Salem and blows smoke in my face. “Am I lying?”

“Come on, Dawn; that’s not right!” I bleat.

Jeff nods and fires up his own smoke. “I’m with you, Louie; that shit’s cold as fuck. I wouldn’t put up with it if I was you. I say you need to put your foot down, Louie.”

Dawn sneers. “Yeah, right. Put his foot down. This little wimp ain’t gonna do shit. Are you?” Without waiting for an answer, she dramatically she drops her cigarette in the ashtray, plucks the Marlboro from Jeff’s lips, leans forward and forces her tongue down his throat. His hand finds her crotch and they make out like teenagers while I stand a few feet away, twiddling my thumbs and gawking like some kind of dunce. I notice that Jeff’s cigarette is still tucked between Dawn’s fingers, and the ember is coming dangerously close to the couch cushion. While contemplating whether to interrupt their moment to tell her she’s about to ruin the sofa, their lips disengage with a pop and my wife plants the cigarette back in her ex’s mouth. They both stand, smirking down at me.

“We’re going upstairs, Lou,” Dawn announces, fangs bared. “Finish cleaning the house.”

Jeff’s mouth is twisted as he hands me his still-smoking Marlboro butt. “Here, Louie, put that out for me, would ya?”

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

It’s damn near midnight and I’m all alone again. Earlier, after Jeff and Dawn finished in the bedroom and I brought the girls home from soccer practice, their dad suggested the family take an hour-long drive to Harrisburg to meet up with some of his old biker buddies at a fish fry. Dawn and the girls loved the idea, but my wife pointed out that there wouldn’t be room for everyone in her Jaguar, and that my minivan is too beat up for such a long trip.

“No problem, guys,” Jeff announced with his chest puffed out. “I bought a new Range Rover—it’s right outside.”

I followed the chattering family out the front door and spotted the gleaming new SUV parked on the curb.

“Like it?” Jeff asked Peyton, which seemed odd. When she nodded, he replied: “Good, because it’s yours when you get your learner’s permit.”

Peyton jumped up and down, screaming like she was at a boy band concert before wrapping her father in a death-squeeze.

“I didn’t want to park it in the driveway and ruin the surprise, so I put ‘er on the curb,” the proud papa said as his oldest daughter embraced him with tears streaming down her cheeks. Jeff told Eva he’d buy her a ride, too, when she was old enough. Dawn fell over herself thanking her ex—and I made sure to do the same before she could order me to do it.

When Jeff first suggested going to the fish fry, I assumed I’d be tagging along. Dawn dashed those hopes by reminding me that I had an interview with a potential employer. She had me pack a few snacks and sodas for the long drive, and then, with Dad the Hero dad at the wheel, the Range Rover and my alleged family disappeared down Elm Street, as I stood in the driveway, pathetically waving goodbye.

The stinking interview took all of five minutes. The lady on the screen couldn’t have looked more disinterested. It was another colossal waste of time. And now I’m home alone … wondering. Pining. Squirming.

I’m sure they’re having a ball. I want to feel good for them, but fuck that. I’d rather wallow in self-pity. I deserve it.

I scarf down a sad, lonely midnight snack—leftover egg salad—turn out the lights and flop into bed. It’s pretty damn late; they must REALLY be having a good time.

When they get home, I’ll pretend to be asleep. I can’t bear to face anyone tonight.

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

Eva twirls spaghetti with her fork.

“Mom? Are you and Dad gonna get back together?”

From my position in the kitchen, I see Dawn shrug. “Why do you ask, baby?”

“I dunno.” Eva glances my way but my head is down as I pretend to wipe the counter. “You guys were all lovey-dovey at the fish fry last night. And Dad’s obviously still in love with you.”

Peyton nods. “Yeah, he is. You can tell by the way he looks at you, Ma. You can’t see that?”

My wife lights a cigarette and blows smoke out of the side of her mouth. “Look, guys, nobody knows what’s gonna happen here. Your dad showing up like he did, with two million dollars … wanting to take care of you two … hell, I dunno—everything’s up in the air right now. Things are a little bit complicated.”

“Why can’t dad just be your boyfriend?” Peyton asks, casting a glimpse in my direction. “It’s not like you don’t see other guys already.”

Dawn sucks her Salem and exhales with a sigh. “Well, shit. We were gonna wait, but I guess we shouldn’t hide it from you guys—yeah, me and your dad have started seeing each together again. We were gonna take it easy till we got everything figured out for sure; didn’t want to get your hopes up.”

“OMG, you’re back with Dad?!” Eva claps, grinning ear-to-ear. “That’s so AWESOME!”

“What about Lou?” Peyton glances into the kitchen again. My head is still down,

“Yeah, how’s that gonna work with Lou around?” Eva searches her mom’s face.

“Lou, come in here,” my wife hollers.

I slink into the living room, my chin touching my chest. “Uh, wussup?” is all I’m able to croak.

“Listen, Lou, the girls are asking about their father and me, and there ain’t no point in hiding things, I don’t think.” Dawn takes a slow drag of her cigarette. “So, go ahead and tell ‘em what we agreed to yesterday.”

I stare at my slippers. “Um, well … your m-mom and d-d-dad … they still …” The inside of my mouth tastes like poop. I try again: “Your mom and dad still have f-f-f-feelings for each other, and I … I mean, I told them it’s … you know, that I wouldn’t … um, you know …”

“Your dad and me are seeing each other again, and Lou’s okay with it,” Dawn cuts off my stammering before twisting her cigarette butt in the ashtray. “We’ll figure everything out as we go, but for now that’s where we are.” She looks at me and points to the foyer counter. “Bring me my phone, would ya?”

I have to force myself to move, although I’m able to goad my muscles into action and hand Dawn her cellphone before slinking back to the kitchen.

“Hey, baby,” she says with syrup in her voice. “OMG, me too. Listen, I told the girls. About us, I mean. Yeah, they started asking questions, and I figured I’d go ahead and tell them. Hope you don’t mind? Oh … yeah … yeah, good. Me, too. Hell yeah, come over—I’ll have Lou make extra for ya.” She cocked her head and smirked. “Yeah, I told them he’s okay with it. We’re good.” With a giggle, she ended the call with, “Love you too, baby.”

Eva laughs. “‘Love you too, baby!’” she mimics her mother with glee.

“Man, that is SO AWESOME you guys are back together,” Peyton gushes.

My head is in the refrigerator. I’m pretending to be looking for something, so if anyone happens to glance my way, they won’t see me crying.

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

The motorcycle’s roar causes a tizzy in the household. Gnashing my teeth, I stir the stew with a vengeance.

“Dad’s here!” Eva announces, clearly thrilled, dashing toward the front door with her older sister at her elbow. Dawn checks herself in the hallway mirror, licks her baby finger and uses it to smooth her mascara at the edge of her eye.

The King struts through the front door, shoulders back, teeth bared. I’d like to smack that shit-eating grin off his face—if only I wasn’t such a fucking coward.

Giggling and gushing, the girls are all over him as usual. Dad, the Big Hero.

After he hugs his daughters, he turns to Dawn and they freeze, grinning at each other. Then, as if they’re reading each other’s minds, they both turn to me at the same time. Jeff scoffs in my direction, scoops Dawn into his arms, and kisses her forcefully. I glance at Eva and she crinkles her nose at me. My lips form an embarrassed smile.

The kiss—a definitive statement to the family as much as a loving greeting—finally ends. “Hey-a, Louie, how’s it hanging?” Jeff asks, his taunting lilt thick. “You told the girls you’re okay with their mom and me?”

I nod, licking my lips to try to work up some saliva. “Y-yeah … um, it’s all good.”

“That’s great, Louie. You’re a bigger man than I am!” Jeff chuckles and takes my wife by the hand, leading her to the couch. “How about grabbing me one of them Heinies—you didn’t drink all of ‘em, did you?”

“Um, no, no, I don’t drink beer,” I stammer. “Hang on.”

“Grab me a Diet Coke while you’re in there,” Dawn orders as I walk toward the kitchen.

“Bring me a Sprite,” Eva calls.

“I’ll take one, too,” Peyton says.

After I fetch the beverages, Jeff addresses me from his perch on my couch. “Dawn tells me you don’t have the money to pay your mortgage.” He cracks open his beer, takes a swig and drapes his arm over my wife.

I rub the back of my neck. “Well … no … no, I don’t. I’m trying to figure something out. I’d work at McDonald’s if I could, but that would mess up my unemployment checks. If I can find something under-the-table, I’d do it … but I don’t know anyone.”

Jeff squeezes Dawn’s shoulder and flashes a scary-looking smile. “Shit, I’ll give you a job, Louie.”

“R-really?” I shuffle my feet. “Um … doing what?”

“I dunno … anything I need done, I guess.” Jeff lifts his arm away from Dawn and lights a Marlboro. “Run errands … wash my Harley … whatever. If you gotta put a name to it, we’ll call you my personal assistant. How’s a grand under the table a week sound?”

“Oh, hell yeah, he’ll take that all day,” Dawn replies without a glance my way.

Jeff smirks and sucks his teeth. “How ‘bout it, Louie?”

Unable to answer, I nod.

“Great.” Jeff takes another sip of beer. “You can start by giving the bike a quick wash. You got Turtle Wax?”

“Um, yeah.”

“Great. Make sure you really buff it, so that shit don’t build up. ‘Kay?”

“Um, yeah, gotcha.”

My feet feel like they’re made of cement as I plod toward the garage. Just as I walk out of the room, I hear Eva giggle.

I’m currently in the middle of redoing my living room for the place I recently bought. I’m trying to lean into a very comfortable and cozy feeling, which to me means autumn colors. 

My family has been insisting that the best way to get colors is through the accents, but I wanted to try these burnt orange drapes. The walls are a linen off-white.

Also, please kind of ignore the sad couch and coffee table- I’m actually going to replace those today. They’re very old and have been hoping from apartment to apartment with me. My menace of a cat is the reason the couch has a cover!

2. What is some **food I must try** in the region? Any recommendations for good restaurants cafes? Bonus points if it's minority cuisine.
3. What’s the **fastest way to get from Xinjie-Puer**, Mengzhuzhai more specifically? 
4. Can I get a train **Mengla-Kunming**? I've read that there was supposed to be a new railroad opened in 2021 connecting the two cities.

However, there's a nice thing going on for me right now. I (23) have known a woman (25) for about a year and a half now; we met while studying an MA degree, and now live in cities that are in close proximity to each other.

She's genuinely the most beautiful person I've ever met, not even exaggerating, and is the kind, meditative, open kind of individual, rarely seems to get stressed or annoyed at things, who speaks to random people on a night out saying she loves what they're wearing, or tells people close to her how cool she thinks they is. She's done the same with me.

Throughout our studies she had a boyfriend, and I just saw it as a cool opportunity to be close mates with someone, and we were; I'd be more open with her than I was with most people, we'd work closely and have deep conversations. She breaks up with her bf as we go into 2025 and I figure ""Hm, I feel like I have a unique thing with her that I have with few other folks. maybe this is a thing?""

I just text her to gauge the situation therefore, asking how she is and being friendly. She texts me pretty consistently and enthusiastically. We see each other at a mutual friend's birthday party in February and there are vibes, eye contact, touching, a certain song plays that I love, we dance and she says the song reminds her of me. We've texted pretty consistently for months, developing lots of inside jokes and being kind of funny with each other.

I suggested a hangout soon and she agrees, but has a busy couple of weekends ahead. I suggest FaceTime at one point, she says I'd rather die than FaceTime but would love to see you soon. Recently she likes my Insta stories too in midst of a point when we haven't talked for a few days. There's a lot to think about lol.

When we hangout, is it okay to think of it as a date of sorts, maybe just even in my own head? Should I do that thing as a guy, where I take the lead, and plan out some coffee spots or art spots for us to visit? I don't want to assume she's over her previous relationship, I think it was pretty long and the breakup wasn't that long ago. There's something pretty positive here though, that feels like a sort of culmination of a year long friendship, and I can't help but get my hopes up.

Emotionally mature. 53 female. Good looking for my age. Good job (Registered Nurse)
Well paid. Work 4 days a week. 
Well educated. 
Own my own home. 2 kids in their 20’s now. Both doing well, both have degrees and are independent and have left home.
Healthy and fit. Enjoy surfing 🏄 Have good friends. I am creative. 

I like reading. I am working on writing my first stand up comedy routine (I am serious lol - nurses have to have a sense of humour)

Can afford to travel- recently went to Bali for 2 weeks on my own.
Tried tinder and I have friend zoned  everyone I have met so far - for various reasons, eg, they want kids, or we don’t click on various things etc.

I am happy and content alone and I have a full life.
But might be nice to have a partner, to travel with or go for a nice walk with,cuddle, have a good conversation, I need someone interesting and intelligent.
Might be nice to have a person who I can do life with. 

So - is it worth even trying??- I do have an “essential” list:
1. Must be kind.
2. Must be hard working 
3. Must be intelligent and emotionally stable/ mature.
4. Must be reliable and honest 
5. Must have some banter/ humour between us.

That’s it.

I had a very kind partner for a few years- years ago now; but he was  lacking in interesting/intelligent conversation ability, and he didn’t work and he still doesn’t (10 plus years later lol) hence my number 2 and 3 essential qualities.

Hope this doesn’t all sound judgmental- but I believe in having standards and I would 100% rather be alone than with the wrong person.

Had horrible relationships in my 20’s which I take responsibility for- I didn’t choose wisely but I am all grown up now!!

I understand I need to go and join groups and hobbies etc. My dream first date is a nice beach walk and a coffee.
I am happy with a simple life. I am low maintenance and pretty chill.

I mow my own lawns!!

Everything I have I have worked for myself. Was a single Mum for many years (and I still am really)

I work in mental health and my strength is kindness and empathy. I need a person who shares my value system.

All recommendations considered- thank you 🥳🤣🤣

Our conversations were one-sided; we planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she’d hurt her leg. She mentioned that I treated her differently after learning about her autism and shared how past boyfriends had abandoned her. When I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she was indifferent, stating she’d only stay in touch if I initiated it. She often talked about her cats and autistic nephews and got upset when her cousin mentioned her drinking with an ex.  

I insisted we go to the movies since she complained we never went out. She hesitated out of embarrassment but agreed. At the cinema, we kissed during the film and spent the afternoon like a couple, but she hid her phone and only shared her Instagram after we broke up. Another time, we went to the mall, where she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. She refused to turn on the lights, became reactive, and abruptly changed moods. During dates, she avoided introducing me to her family.  

During an argument, I criticized her favorite game, and she stopped playing. She brought me chocolate but soon suggested breaking up. She invited me to a party, then wavered, prompting me to ask if she didn’t want me there. I arrived early, her sister saw me, and we went up together. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend but suggested we ""download an app to find a hottie"" for me. We went to her place, where she wanted me to stay, but I left.  

After repeated tensions, I ended things. She cried, blocked me, accused me of ""sending her to mental health services (CAPS)"" and ruining her happiness. Days later, she said she missed me, and we reconnected. I found her on a dating app; she claimed she was searching for her friend’s ex. I confessed my love, and she invited me to meet her somewhere, but I didn’t go. Her mom called, questioning my feelings and inviting me for coffee.  

We talked again, but she said her dad was angry with me. I vented online, she saw it, accused me of manipulation, blamed her autism for her insecurities, said she prayed for me daily, then blocked me again and vanished completely.",1,1744984829.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Looking to boost your online visibility without burning through your marketing budget? I've been helping small businesses improve their digital presence for years, and I'm consistently surprised by how many overlook one of the most effective tools available: business directories.

Far from being outdated digital phonebooks, today's business directories are powerful marketing assets that can dramatically improve your visibility, credibility, and bottom line—especially for local businesses.

**TL;DR: Why List Your Business in Directories**
- Significantly boosts local SEO through consistent citations
- Increases visibility to customers actively searching for your services
- Builds credibility through third-party validation and reviews
- Offers cost-effective marketing compared to paid advertising
- Provides valuable data about customer behavior

## Key Benefits Worth Knowing

### Supercharges Your Local SEO

When I helped a local coffee shop clean up their directory listings (ensuring consistent name, address, phone across platforms), their ""near me"" search visibility jumped by 30% in just two months—with zero other SEO work!

Search engines like Google use directories as trusted sources to verify business information. These consistent citations are fundamental to local SEO and can help you rank even if your website isn't performing well yet.

### Connects You With Ready-to-Buy Customers

Unlike broad marketing that interrupts browsing, directories connect you with people actively searching for what you offer. Think about your own behavior—when looking for a plumber or restaurant, don't you often browse directory listings to compare options?

### Builds Instant Credibility

Being listed in reputable directories signals legitimacy to potential customers. The review features in most directories provide crucial social proof, influencing purchase decisions before someone even visits your website.

## Choosing the Right Directories

Not all directories deliver equal value. Focus on:

1. **Reputation & Authority**: Start with Google Business Profile (absolutely essential), then Yelp, Yellow Pages, and Bing Places

2. **Industry-Specific Options**: Restaurants should prioritize Tripadvisor/OpenTable, while service businesses might focus on Angie's List or HomeAdvisor

3. **Optimization Matters**: Complete EVERY field, use strategic keywords (without stuffing), and invest in high-quality photos—businesses with complete galleries receive significantly more engagement

## Measuring Success

Track metrics like profile views, website click-throughs, phone calls, direction requests, and review volume. Many premium directories provide analytics dashboards that make this simple.

## Building Your Own Directory Site

If you're entrepreneurially minded, creating a niche directory website can be incredibly profitable. I've seen specialized directories generate substantial passive income through listing fees and advertising.

For those interested, [TurnKeyDirectories.com](https://turnkeydirectories.com/) offers a fantastic plugin that makes building your own directory site surprisingly simple—no coding skills required. Their templates are specifically designed for maximum SEO benefit and user engagement.

## The Bottom Line

Directory listings remain one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies available to small businesses. Don't wait for customers to stumble across your website—place your business directly in their path when they're actively searching.

Frisky Business

Chapter One Hayes.I’d like to tell you I have my shit together. That I have it all figured out.But if you saw me standing here right now, on the sidewalk in my boxer briefs—for God and everyone to see—you’d know I’m totally full of shit.My now ex-girlfriend stands on the balcony of her second-floor apartment, glaring down at me, dressed only in a peach-colored silk robe. Her hair is loose and her face is red with anger, but there are no tears.“You bastard!” Samantha cries out and throws another armful of my clothing over the balcony. One of my socks gets stuck on a tree branch.I grab my T-shirt from the sidewalk and tug it on. It’s May, but it’s still chilly in the mornings, and the cool air nips at my bare skin.My shoes are thrown down next—one at a time. One bounces into the street, and I wait for a city bus to pass before I retrieve it.I look back up at Samantha, bracing myself for what comes next. In her hands is my laptop bag. Fuck. Complete with my laptop, because I’d come here straight from work last night.A few of the neighbors have stepped onto their balconies to see what all the noise is about. Swallowing my pride, I tip my chin at Mrs. Hendrickson from apartment 202 and smile. Her eyes widen in surprise.“Jesus, Sam, be reasonable,” I call out.My laptop bag comes sailing over the balcony next and lands with a loud crack on the sidewalk. There goes my laptop.I have no fucking clue where this Samantha came from. She woke me up this morning with sex—seemed like a good sign, right? We’ve only been dating for two months, but I thought things were going well. Turns out, I don’t know shit about shit.Maybe she wanted one last ride? Something to remember me by?Fuck, I was so wrong.I scrub my hands down my face.“You’ll never commit,” Samantha says, her voice trembling with rage.That’s not true. I’ve eaten the same brand of cereal for the past twelve years. I know a thing or two about commitment. But I decide now isn’t the right time to point this out to her.After we had sex this morning, she curled up on her pillow, gazing at me with a soft expression. “Where do you think this is going with me and you?” She touched my chest, her fingertips tracing lazy circles on my skin.I told her the truth, that I wasn’t sure but that I liked hanging out with her. Apparently, that was the wrong answer.She sat up suddenly, tugging the sheet up with her to cover her naked chest. “That’s what you think this is? Hanging out?”“No, of course not,” I said, instinctively backpedaling.“I’m almost thirty, Hayes.” She squinted at me.I’m almost thirty too, but I wasn’t sure what our ages have to do with anything.“I want more,” she said, frowning. “A relationship. A real commitment. Marriage. Babies. A family.”Things went south fast after that.I’ve known her for two months, so I thought what we had was just casual. I haven’t even introduced her to my grandmother yet, who lives with me. Hell, Samantha has only been inside my apartment once. She’s never spent the night, a fact she reminds me of regularly with disdain.Another neighbor peeks his head out of his window, a coffee mug in one hand, a yipping dog in the other.Cars drive by, some slowing down to watch the drama unfold. I can’t say I blame them. This is certainly the most exciting way I’ve started a Friday morning in a long time.Finally, my jeans are tossed over the balcony, and I rush to catch them. My cell phone is still in one pocket, miraculously intact. I tug on my jeans and shove my feet into the pair of Vans I rescued.Without another word, Samantha marches inside and slams the sliding glass door.Mrs. Hendrickson heads back inside too.Show’s over, folks. Nothing more to see.After snagging my laptop bag from the sidewalk, I head off down the street. I stop at the gas station on the corner and buy myself a shitty cup of coffee before I go find my car. Samantha’s neighborhood is in a bustling area of Chicago. There’s never any parking. But I got lucky last night, and my car’s only two blocks over. Wrapping a hand around the warmth of my cup, I head in the direction of my Lexus.Once I reach my car, I chuck the laptop bag with my busted computer into the back seat. As I pull out into traffic, my cell phone rings. I assume it’s Samantha, thinking maybe she wants to continue telling me off, and I almost don’t answer. But the name on the screen says Wolfie.I let out a silent groan and answer on speaker. “Hey, man. What’s up?” I ask after downing another mouthful of the awful coffee.“Need you to do me a favor,” he says in his gruff voice. No hello. No good morning. Typical Wolfie.But the bastard knows I’d do anything for him. Just like he would for me. Which is the reason why I let him get away with his caveman behavior.“It’s my first day off in like two years, asshole.”“I know, I know,” he says with a chuckle.I roll my eyes. “What’s the favor?” It’s no use arguing with him. I’m going to do whatever it is he needs me to do.“I need you to go check on Maren.”Except for that.Maren is Wolfie’s younger sister. She graduated last year with a degree in social work. She’s a good girl. Wants to help others. Make a difference in the world.The problem is, I’ve never felt about Maren Cox the way I should have. I feel cagey when I’m around her, like a lion at the zoo, right before feeding time.“You there?” Wolfie asks at my silence.“I’m here.”He lets out a long sigh. “She’s sick. Says she’s staying home from work today. Swing by her apartment and check on her for me?”I’m reminded of all of the other times Wolfie or Maren have called me like this, needing a favor—like when she locked herself out of her apartment, or when her car broke down on the side of the road, or that time her pet goldfish died and she couldn’t bring herself to flush it. What a fucking hassle.I remember her as a kid with a toothy smile and big eyes, always trailing a few steps behind us and calling out for us to wait up. Of course, Maren looks a whole lot different these days. She’s twenty-five now, and she’s grown into quite a woman. Every time I’m near her, I have to force my gaze away from her full breasts, her lush mouth, and those long, toned legs of hers.I was there for her on the night of her twenty-first birthday, holding her hair back when she puked out the car window. I was there when she had her heart broken for the first time, when her fuck stick of a boyfriend dumped her after six months of dating. I pulled her to my chest with an annoyed sigh and she tearfully broke down, making me feel even worse.But that was nothing compared to the pain I felt when I learned he’d broken up with her only after punching her V-card. I wanted to hunt him down and castrate him. I wanted to make him suffer. But of course I promised a heartbroken Maren I’d do no such thing. Instead, I had to watch her cry over that dick bag for weeks.“Why can’t you go?” I ask, even though I already know the answer to that question.Wolfie lets out a sigh. “Inventory day. Caleb, Connor, and Ever have all been here since five.”I swallow, feeling shitty about it because I should be there too.I own a toy company, Frisky Business, with my best friends. Yes, those kinds of toys. The very adult kind. Our business is my passion, but I haven’t taken a day off in years. My partners insisted I do it—take a long weekend to myself. Practically forced my hand.“There’s no one I trust more,” Wolfie says.He’s like family to me, and that means Maren is too. I made a vow to him, and I’d never break his trust.They had it rough growing up. Wolfie did everything for Maren. When their dad drank away his paycheck, it was Wolfie who got a second job his senior year of high school. While the rest of us played video games and messed around on the basketball court, he was bussing tables at the diner to pay for her ballet classes and new school supplies.“Yeah, I’ll go,” I say after a long pause.As loyal as Wolfie is, he’s always been a loner. The dude rarely calls or texts unless he needs something, but he’d also be the first to sign up if you asked him for a favor.“Thanks, man. I owe you one,” he says.I grunt and end the call. Fifteen minutes later, I pull into the parking garage under my building.My grandma and roommate, Rosie, smiles at me when I unlock the front door and enter the kitchen. “They actually talked you into it, huh?”“What?”“They made you take a day off.”“Oh, right.” I push my hands through my hair. “Yeah, they did.” I let out a humorless chuckle.She pours a cup of coffee and hands it to me. “Thought you’d be sleeping in. You’re up early.”I nod and accept the coffee mug, deciding to spare her the story of my breakup this morning. “Wolfie asked if I’d go check on Maren. I guess she’s sick.”Rosie makes a contemplative noise. “You’re a good friend.”“I guess.”She chuckles and pats my forearm. “I have plans with Marge later. We’re going to the farmer’s market.”“Be careful.” My grandmother still drives, and I have mixed feelings about that.She chuckles again. “Don’t worry so much. Are you going to see that girl of yours today?”I shake my head. “We’re not seeing each other anymore.”Rosie raises one thin silver eyebrow at me. “You go through ’em fast. I sure hope you know what you’re doing.”Me? Not a fucking clue.After I finish my coffee, I feel more human. You’d think Sam dumping me in such a spectacular fashion would have thrown me off, and it has a little. But it’s less about Sam and more about the fact that I’m starting to notice a pattern.None of my relationships have lasted more than a few weeks, a few months at most. And the only common denominator is me. And Sam had a point—I am almost thirty, which isn’t exactly old, but it’s old enough.Why can’t I ever seem to make things work? The answer to that question nags at me, but I’m not ready to hear it.Inside my bedroom, I shut the door and head into the adjoining bathroom. I crank the faucet to hot and step under the spray of water. Soaping myself up, I wash the scent of Samantha from my skin.After I’m dressed in a clean T-shirt and another pair of jeans, I grab my keys and phone. I press a kiss to my grandma’s cheek and head out.Maren’s apartment is in a neat tidy row of older homes that were turned into duplexes in the eighties. The rent is reasonable, and street parking is plentiful. I park in front of the brick building and climb out.I knock on her door, and after a moment, it opens. Maren is dressed in a pair of yoga pants and a T-shirt, her long dark hair tied up in a messy bun. She’s five foot five, but barely comes to my chin.“Hayes.” She smiles when she sees me, lifting up on her toes to hug me. Wrapping her arms around my neck, she pulls me close.I touch the middle of her back, patting it once, and then release her, needing to put some distance between us.If she knew all the dirty thoughts I have when she presses her soft tits to my chest like that, she wouldn’t come so willingly into my arms. But Maren’s always been affectionate. She’s like that with everyone. I don’t think she understands the meaning of personal space, so I try not to read into it.Smiling at me, she asks, “What are you doing here?”“Wolfie sent me. He said you’re sick.” But she doesn’t look sick. Her cheeks are rosy and she’s still smiling.Maren’s eyes widen and her cheeks flush. “Um, no. I’m not.”I shift my weight on her front porch. “He said you called into work sick today.”She meets my eyes again. They’re the color of bright emeralds and golden autumn leaves with melted milk chocolate in the very center. Technically, the word is hazel, but it’s much too simple a word to describe all the life and depth I see when I look into her eyes.There are a lot of things I feel about Maren. Confusion. Misplaced lust. And irritation—because I’ve never felt about this girl the way I should have.“Well, that part’s true.”“Care to fill me in?”She groans. “You might as well come inside.”I follow her into her one-bedroom apartment. It’s not fancy, but it’s clean and always neat. A gray couch sits in the living room on top of a colorful rug. Plants in mismatched pots are lined on the windowsill, and her tiny kitchen is spotless.“Coffee?” she asks.",1,1744984397.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k25fmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k25fmd/the_games_i_used_to_play/,The Games I Used To Play,"This a culmination of three previous parts so that I may condense and more accurately tell my full story.  


When I was a kid, I used to play these “games” to scare myself. I know, it's weird, but I was a bit of a loner growing up and I needed some way to entertain myself while my mom was working her overnights at the hospital. I was actually incredibly brave as a child.



It’s funny how time changes a person.



It wasn’t until I moved in with my fiancé’ that the memories of my childhood games came back to me. Our new house was perfect, a two story fixer-upper with a basement in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. We had been moved in for about a week and were sorting out some boxes in the basement when Adrienne noticed the time.



“You promised we’d be in bed by midnight.”



I checked my watch, it was nearing one in the morning. We had been unpacking for nearly four straight  hours. The unfinished basement was dimly lit by a singular fluorescent bulb, one of those ones that is attached to a pull chain. The hopper window in the back was covered with a thick bush that I hadn’t gotten around to trimming down yet, so time had completely slipped away.



“Yeah, you’re right. Not sure why we’re organizing Christmas stuff - we won’t need it for months. Let’s get to bed and pick this up in the morning.”



I went to head up the stairs, but was stopped when Adrienne grabbed my hand.



“Hey! Don’t you dare leave me here. This basement creeps me out.”



I chuckled as I scanned our basement’s mostly vacant walls. Unimpressive certainly, but I didn’t think anything about it was explicitly creepy. I should have known better. Adrienne is the type of person to look away from a movie at the first hint of blood. I love her with all my heart, but she is possibly the biggest scaredy cat that I know.



“Alright, go on up. I’ll get the light.”



I let Adrienne get halfway up the stairs before I pulled the chain on the bulb, leaving me in near total darkness. At that moment, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. Alone, in the shadow-filled basement, I was transported back in time to one of my favorite childhood games. 



I smiled to myself as the repressed memory bubbled up. 



I would play the game, one last time. 



I loitered in the basement, casually and confidently. I *knew* not to turn around. I knew exactly how to play from when I was a child. It was like riding a bike. I felt the monster behind me getting closer. My instincts told me to run, but that would be cheating.

The way to win the game was by waiting until the very last possible moment before fleeing and bursting out of the basement door into the light of the kitchen. I must have played this particular game at least a hundred times when I was a child. I always won.



It wasn’t about knowing what step to start running, it was about feeling the fear and adrenaline. That was the only way to know for certain how close the monster was. 



My fully grown body caused the wooden steps to creak in a way that I had never had to account for before. Would this change the game? 



When I was about halfway up the stairs I knew the monster was close. My heartrate quickened and I *wanted* to run. My smile widened as I experienced the same fear and adrenaline that had powered me as a child. 



Don’t turn around. Don’t run. Not yet.



One more step.



My body went into motion faster than my brain had time to register. I sprinted up the remainder of the stairs and slammed the basement door behind me out of pure instinct. I smiled at Adrienne who stared at me with wide eyes. 



Once again, I beat the monster.



“What was that?” Adrienne asked quickly.



She raced for her phone and I stared at her, confused.



“I didn’t mean to scare you! It was just a game that I used to play when I was a kid. I would turn off the basement lights and walk up the stairs, until the very last moment. Then, I would run.”



What Adrienne said next will forever be etched into my memory as one of the most haunting things that I had ever heard.



“Then why did I hear two pairs of footsteps?”



Looking back knowing what I know now, I think that's the definitive moment where it all started back up. Anyway, I’ll continue from that point.



After Adrienne told me that she had heard two pairs of footsteps coming up the stairs, I’m not going to lie, I freaked a little. Obviously, I did my best to keep my composure in front of her. Panicking is the last thing you would want to do in front of Adrienne. I love the girl to death, but she really knew how to make a mountain out of a molehill. 



We ended up calling the police to have them check out the basement. The house was new to us so someone squatting down there was, in my mind, a very real possibility. When the officers gave us the all clear and the flashing blue and red lights pulled out of our long driveway I was overcome with embarrassment. 



It was a simple case of me accidentally spooking Adrienne and in doing so I rattled myself a little too. That was all.



But as I’m sure you’re aware, if that was all that had come of it I wouldn’t be making an update.



That night, I agreed to let Adrienne fall asleep with the TV on, on the condition it was set to a thirty minute sleep timer. I wouldn’t be able to rest until it automatically shut off, but she needed the sound and light to comfort her and what position was I in to protest? I closed my eyes and attempted to tune out several different British accents arguing back and forth on the matter of courting a woman. When thirty minutes had passed, I was no closer to sleep, but I did know that Duke Worthington was an absolute prick.



The light rise and fall of Adrienne’s body beside me indicated that she had been asleep for some time now. The night had dragged far longer than either of us had expected, and she is much less of a night owl than I am. 



Finally, surrounded by total darkness and lullabied by eerie silence I *should* have been able to sleep. But I couldn’t.



There was something that was still bothering me. Sure, the police didn’t find anyone living in our basement, but I couldn’t shake the feeling I had when I played the game.



The game felt real. The fear, the adrenaline, the knowledge that I was being watched from something lurking deep in the shadows. I knew that I wasn’t the only player.



You can say what you want about me, but I had to know for my own sanity if what I experienced was a fluke, or if there was something else that I was missing.



So, in the complete darkness of our bedroom, I stuck my hand outside of the warm protection of my covers. My hand ventured far, dangling off the side of the bed, like a worm on a hook, bobbing in the vast expanse of an uncharted ocean. 



And just like that, I was playing another game.



This game was even more simple than the last. The only rule was this: give the monster something worth taking.



My eyes remained closed as my arm swayed on the side of my bed, not quite at carpet level, but low enough that anything lurking beneath the bed frame would be tempted to snatch it. 



I let it dangle for agonizing seconds that turned to minutes. The air around my hand grew cold, completely exposed to the abyss below.



When I deemed my arm insufficient bait I raised the comforter, letting my naked feet poke out from their protective shield. If the monster went for my arm, there was a chance I could defend myself, but my toes? They were completely unguarded. 



And after several minutes, my toes grew cold as well.



The game was so childish, I could hardly believe that I was playing it. If there was a monster, or god forbid, an actual person, in my room what good would a three inch fabric comforter do? But still I played. I needed to know. I *needed* closure.



By the time I tucked all my limbs back under the blanket, I’d already accepted the lame victory. I may have won, but could it even be called that if my opponent wasn’t playing the game?



After a few days had passed, I was beginning to think that it had all blown over. Work on the house was going well, it was still an absolute fixer-upper, but I enjoyed doing a bit of manual labor every now and again. Adrienne was incredible when it came to visualizing a room and picking color palettes, but man that girl avoided the manual labor like it was a plague. I guess if you wanted to look at it in a more positive light, you could say the two of us made a good team.



Just when I thought that my childhood games were fully behind me I woke up from a dreamless sleep. It wasn’t uncommon for me, I had a bladder roughly equivalent to that of a seventy year old woman. But I didn’t need to pee, so I rolled on my side away from Adrienne. 



I don’t know what made me do it, but I picked up my phone from the nightstand and checked the time.



When I saw the aggressively bright white numbers illuminated against my dark wallpaper my heart skipped a beat.



3:27 AM.



The monster wanted to play.



I knew this game well, probably because it was the monster's favorite. I’m not saying that he had explicitly told me this of course, but based on the amount of times that I woke up in my childhood bedroom at this exact time, one would have to infer. 



Quickly and silently I got up from the bed and made my way over to the door. It was a creaky, shitty, thing, but thankfully the sound of cracking it slightly ajar did not wake Adrienne.



To play this game, the door needed to be open. Usually, I kept the door open while I slept, but for whatever reason, Adrienne had jokingly described that as one of my “red flags”. Rich talk coming from someone who pours milk in before the cereal.



I crawled back into bed and fixed my eyes on the door. Then I shut them. This was another simple game. The monster wanted me to watch. I needed to open my eyes exactly when the clock struck 3:28. When I was a child, I always instinctively knew when that would be. Maybe it's genetic, but I’ve been gifted a really intuitive feel for time. I don’t know how to describe it other than that. For example, I could sit in a lightless room for an indeterminate amount of time, and when I stepped out I could pinpoint exactly how much time had passed down to the minute.



As I faced the open door with my eyes closed I thought about this fact. Maybe all this time I had been unconsciously counting heartbeats. The steady, rhythmic, thump, thump, of blood flowing from my veins, through my heart, and out of my arteries. 



It’s just a theory, but that night, with my heart racing with a fear that I never possessed as I child, it would explain why I calculated wrong. 



When I opened my eyes, it was not yet 3:28.



I knew that for a fact, because lit by the slivers of moonlight that pierced through our curtains I saw a massive black arm reaching into my room. The arm wasn’t human. No man or woman would have nails that sharp or such feral hair growing in patchy spots. 



Shit, there really is no other way to describe other than saying it was the monster's arm. It had to be. It was the only explanation.



I saw the arm for less than a second before it vanished. Even now as I am recalling the details, I can’t say for certain what was real and what was just my mind playing tricks on me. My calculation must have been off by a mere second. Because I know that when the clock struck 3:28, the monster disappeared.



Who knows what could have happened if I peeked any earlier or later. The dozens of times that I had played this game before, it was all just one fucked up version of peek-a-boo. But I cannot recall even once, experiencing anything remotely like this. 



The moment I saw the monster I bolted upright and the motion was enough to wake Adrienne. 



“What’s wrong?” She asked as she looked up at me.



I refused to let my gaze shift from the door. 



Adrienne followed my eyes and stared at the door confused.



Even if what I saw was a figment of my imagination, I *know* that I opened the door enough to play the monster’s game. But staring at it then, at 3:28 AM, the door was closed.



Sunrise came several hours later, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to sleep another wink. The events of the previous night wore on me late into the morning, and by noon, I caved. I didn’t need to search long - I knew exactly which box I had put them in. My old lighter and an unopened pack of Marlboros. By the time I made it to the box, the decision was already made.



I took the pack and lighter to our screened in porch and sat on the rocking swing. Starting the moment I lit the cigarette I counted the seconds until Adrienne stormed onto the porch, wearing a furious expression that didn’t belong anywhere near her adorable face.



Have you ever seen a puppy frown before? Or have you said the word “Bubbles” as angrily as you could? That was Adrienne when she got upset with me. Damn near the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.



But I knew she would find me here, the girl has the nose of a bloodhound.



She crossed her arms and tapped her fuzzy pink sock against the wood of the deck.



“Is there something you want to tell me about?”



“I had a long night. Maybe it's just the stress of the move getting to me, but I barely slept. I just needed a cigarette or two, I promise I won’t start up again.”



Adrienne shook her head as she stepped closer and snatched the pack and lighter away. Out of respect, I refrained from taking another puff. At least until she inevitably left.



“You don’t get it. It’s not about these.”



She waved the pack of Marlboros in front of me mockingly. 



“It’s about trust. When something goes wrong, or you have a bad day, I want you to feel like you can turn to *me*. Not cigarettes or pills. Babe, I’m here. And I will always be for you.”



At that moment, I felt worse than a stack of shit on a sunny day.



Adrienne sat next to me, placing a comforting hand on my thigh. “So, do you want to take that cancer stick out of your mouth and tell me what's bothering you?”



I shook my head. “You wouldn’t understand. I don’t think that *I* even understand yet.”



“Try me. We don’t give up on each other.”



She really was too damn good for me.



“I can’t. Not yet, at least.” 



Yeah rip me apart, why don’t you? I know, I should have let her in and explained it all. I get that I fucked up, but at the moment I want you to realize that I thought that my imaginary childhood monster was haunting me and I was beyond exhausted from the move. I didn’t need Adrienne freaking out because before you know it we’d be house hunting again.



Adrienne stood, clearly hurt. I could stand to see her angry, but betrayed was not an expression that my heart was adapted for.



“Okay. I understand. Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here.”  Adrienne walked back inside in her fuzzy pink socks to return to whatever room she was decorating today.



Slowly, I dropped the cigarette and crushed it with my boot.



I pulled out my phone and scanned through my contacts. I paused with my index finger hovering over those three dreadful letters.



I knew I didn’t call as much as I should. You’d be hard pressed to find a single son or daughter that did. But after everything my mom did to raise me on her own, she deserved more from me.

Reluctantly, I pressed dial and raised the phone to my ear.



A full ring didn’t even complete before I heard her voice.



“Mark?” The hint of worry in her words only made me feel more guilty for not reaching out sooner.



“Hey Mom. I uhh… How are you doing?”



She was silent for a moment.



“I’m good. Yeah, things around here have been pretty quiet lately. It’s nice to hear your voice. Honestly, I was waiting for you to call, but I know how busy you must be with the new house.”



“Yeah, yeah. I’ve certainly had my hands full.”



“I just want to say how proud I am of you for finally getting out there on your own.”



“Right.” 



I rocked forward and back on the swing with my phone pressed to my ear.



“So, what are you calling about? Is everything alright? You know you can always come and live with me if things get too overwhelming.”



“We- I’m great. Thanks, but I don’t need to live with you. The house is perfect. I’m actually calling with a bit of a weird question though. Do you remember the games I used to play when I was a kid? I mostly played them while you were at the hospital overnight, but I… I don’t know. Does any of this ring a bell?”



My mom fell silent for what felt like minutes.



“You really don’t remember do you?”



“Remember what?”



“Oh Mark, I really don’t know if I should be doing this. I thought we closed that chapter of our lives a long time ago. I don’t want to reopen any old wounds. Are you still seeing Adrienne?”



I furrowed my brows. I loved my mom, but she had a habit of asking the most bizarre questions. 



“Of course I’m still seeing Adrienne! What do you mean by old wounds?”



I tried to think back to any specific event she could possibly be referring to, but my memory was too foggy. The only clear pictures of my childhood I had were the games that I used to play.



“Maybe you should talk to her first.”



My jaw tightened as I wondered what my mom and Adrienne could both possibly know that I didn’t. As far as I was aware the two weren’t even on speaking terms.



“I tried, but she won’t have the answers I need. But you will. Tell me what I’m not remembering about the games.”



I heard a lighter click on the other side of the line. I hate it when she smokes. It reminds me of the same dreadful addiction that I inherited from her.



“Alright look Mark, I’m going to tell you, but you need to promise me that you’ll take care of yourself, you hear me? I worry about you. You’re my baby boy and I know I wasn’t always the best mother, but I tried. So please, don’t blame me. I’ve already blamed myself enough for the both of us.”



“Of course I won't blame you Mom. I love you, and I know how much you love me. I can take care of myself.”



Somehow, even when I was young I understood the weight that came with being a single parent. I knew that she was struggling financially and emotionally with my dad’s absence, but I never blamed her. Hell I never even blamed my dad either. He didn’t want to think about me, and I didn’t want to think about him either. I had no other family to watch me while she was gone, yet I was never alone. I had my games, and I had the monster that I played them with.



Thinking about it as an adult, it sends a shiver down my spine.



“Alright, here goes. I came home late one night, and as per my usual routine I peeked into your room to check on you before I crashed into bed. That night, your bed was empty. I called out and you didn’t answer. Panicked as all hell, I checked my room, the living room, and the bathrooms. It was then when I heard a faint voice coming from downstairs. I raced down there and I flipped on the light and there you were, sitting with your legs crossed, facing a corner of the room. Your eyes were closed and even when the light turned on, you didn’t open them. I called your name, and you didn’t so much as flinch. As I stepped closer, I heard what you were whispering. It was numbers. Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. I shouted your name again. Eight. Seven. Six. Mark, I was petrified. I didn’t know what to do so I shook you hard. That must have broken you out of whatever trance you were in because you looked up at me and you smiled. That’s when you asked me a simple question: ‘Do you want to play too?’”



My skin had grown completely covered in goosebumps as I listened to the story. I remembered it now. The countdown game. That night was the only time that I had ever played it, and I can’t say for sure, but I think it may have been the last game I ever played. We moved out of my childhood home a few weeks later. Our new house was a two bedroom apartment, much smaller than my childhood home. The neighbors were noisy, and I remember for the first time in my life having a dedicated babysitter.



With all the noise and distraction, the monster never came back. I no longer woke up routinely at 3:27 AM, and there was no basement to loiter in after the lights had been shut. I didn’t think much of the games for a while. It wasn’t exactly something that would get you invited to very many high school parties. 



Not that I ever found out what *would* get you invited.



I finished the call with my mom, thanking her for the information and promising that I would call more often. As I sat on the swing I thought about the game that I had only dared to play once, a nagging question burning at my insides.



*What would have happened if I made it to zero?*



At the time I had no idea.



Now I do.



A few nights after I called my mom and asked about my childhood games Adrienne told me that she would be going out with a few girlfriends.



Honestly, when she told me this, I was conflicted. On one hand, with the house to myself I *could* do whatever I wanted. Which, of course meant that I could play any game. On the other hand, I was fucking terrified.



When Adrienne left for the night, it was the first time that I was completely alone in our new house. It wasn’t long before the silence began to drive me mad. With each passing minute I grew more paranoid.



The more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn’t entirely buy my mother’s story. 



She was hiding something from me - that much I was certain of. I considered calling her again and confronting her, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. *If* I was somehow wrong, I couldn’t bear to break her heart with my distrust. It wouldn’t be fair to her after all she had done for me. 



I stared down the creaky flight of wooden stairs into a lightless void. My heart raced as I thought about the monster waiting for me down there. It suddenly became incredibly difficult to breathe. I had played hundreds of games with the monster when I was a kid and not once did I experience a fear so petrifying. 



It seemed so normal to me at the time. The monster was just a part of the games. I never thought of him as anything more than that.



That night I never worked up the courage to descend the first step.



Instead, I stayed in the protective light of my kitchen, making sure to flip hall lights on both sides for maximum security. I avoided looking out the window into our backyard. The less ammunition I gave my brain to play tricks on itself the better.



I sat at the kitchen table and scrolled for hours. Instagram, Twitter, Reddit - anything to keep my mind off of the isolation I was confined to. 



About an hour into my scrolling, I began to hear noises coming from the basement. The sounds started innocently enough, something that could easily be mistaken for the gentle rattle of pipes settling in an old house. Then came rustling. It sounded like a raccoon, or other small animal had gotten loose down there and was knocking over cans and crawling into boxes.



I glanced up from my phone a few times to keep an eye on the door, but I knew that I needed to pretend I was uninterested. I didn’t need to play. I wouldn’t be a part of the monster’s games.



The sound became harder to ignore when the rustling turned to whispers. I couldn’t discern any specific words that were being uttered, but the imitation of the human voice was unmistakable. The vibrations carried themselves up, through the walls and through the tile floor of the kitchen.



Someone or something was down there.



But I already knew that.



I quickly unlocked my phone and opened my favorite contacts. I stared at Adrienne’s name, my heart damn near about to beat out of my chest. Her name sat above “Mom” as the only two in the short list.



Before clicking on her name I glanced at the clock. It was only 9:24 PM. She would be out with her girlfriends partying it up at the local bars well into the AM. I couldn’t do this to her. 



Instead, I lowered my phone to my side, and I cried. I can’t say for sure why. Call it exhaustion, loneliness, or fear. It doesn’t matter to me. But I do know that the monster broke me that night. 



And it did so without me even playing its games.



When I eventually crawled into bed I knew that sleep wouldn’t come easily. Hell, I’ll admit that I put on that damn British regency era romance show without a sleep timer. The light and sound did little to calm my nerves. I was smart enough to know that the television had all the same defensive properties as my comforter that I tucked myself into.



I pretended to be asleep in bed long enough to feel a numbness take over my body. My fear only subsided when Adrienne finally came home for the night. She tiptoed into our room, careful not to wake me. She crawled into bed next to me, and finally, feeling the comforting weight of her body next to mine, I was able to drift off into a dreamless sleep.



When I woke in the morning I wasn’t surprised that Adrienne was already up and out of bed. The TV was still on so I powered it off before I made my way to the kitchen, hoping that she had already started a pot of coffee. Typically, I avoid consuming caffeine but I was going to need all the help I could get if I wanted to make any real progress on cleaning up the backyard.



Stumbling into the kitchen, I saw Adrienne enter the front door wearing the same outfit she had gone out in last night.



When she saw my hair she laughed to herself. “And I thought I was the only one who had a long night.”  



I wiped the grogginess from my eyes before I responded.



“What were you doing on the porch? And why haven’t you changed?”



Adrienne cocked her head to the side.



“I tried to call you a hundred times. Jane got too wasted to drive so I had to crash at Dana’s last night. I’m just getting home now.”



The blood in my veins turned to ice.



Something had crawled into my bed last night. I heard it breathing. I felt its weight beside me. We were inches apart in the total darkness of my room. The thought made it feel like a hundred different bugs were crawling all over my skin. 



Luckily, Adrienne didn’t seem to notice my change in demeanor as she excused herself to shower. I sat down on the couch in our unpacked living room and covered my mouth with my hand.



The monster was getting too comfortable. I didn’t know what it wanted from me, but it had to know that I was terrified.



My first instinct was to get out of the house, but I couldn’t run forever. Even if I made the drastic decision to pack up and move, I knew that the monster would follow me wherever I went. 



I talked through my options with myself on the couch. I know that may sound weird, but I needed someone to bounce ideas off of and I’ve always found talking to myself to be helpful with problem solving.



By the end of the conversation, I had come to a grave and terrifying conclusion. I needed answers. And I knew exactly where I would find them. They would be waiting for me in the corner of my pitch black basement. They would come into light when I finished counting back from one hundred.



Before I knew it night had fallen upon the house and the day had slipped away from me. I wondered where the time went, but the reality was it didn’t even matter. I wasn’t in the right headspace to be doing housework.



As I lay in bed next to Adrienne I considered telling her everything. I was about to do something incredibly stupid that had a very real chance of getting her hurt. At the end of the day, I decided against it.



I didn’t know what my monster wanted, but it seemed way more interested in me than it was in Adrienne. It was my battle and I couldn’t get her involved. She came into my life when I was at my lowest point and she had shown me what true happiness was. For that, I will always be grateful. I love you, Adrienne.



When I was sure that my fiancé was asleep I kicked my feet out of bed silently. My toes pushed onto the scratchy carpet as I took my first few steps towards my bedroom door. We had only lived in the new house for a few days, yet I was already beginning to understand how to navigate it in the dark. 



To guide me, I let my right hand trace the wall, my fingers bobbing up and down against the drywall. I turned when I reached the kitchen. The door to the basement was already open, inviting me downstairs.



Had I left it open? I couldn’t remember.



The basement was silent. There was no rustle or whisper because the monster knew that I was coming. There was no need for an invitation.



I took a steadying breath and began my descent down the creaky wooden steps. I moved slowly and quietly as I forced myself to remain brave. The only reason I had won so many of the monster’s games when I was a child was because of my naïve courage. As an adult, I had finally come to understand fear’s true meaning.



Fear was understanding everything that you had to lose. 



Bravery was fighting to keep it, in spite of that fear.



As my bare foot kissed the cool concrete of the basement floor I pushed forward into the darkness. I would fight for Adrienne. I would fight for my mom. And I would fight for myself.



Before I began the countdown I switched on the basement’s singular fluorescent bulb. 



As I expected, the room was a mess of boxes and bags filled to the brim with decorations. Slowly, I slid mountains of cardboard out of the way, clearing my path to the corner. I was hundreds of miles away from the house where I first played the countdown game. The corner would be different, but the game would be the same.



As I bent over to lift the last remaining box I paused as I read the label taped on top.



“MARK - CHILDHOOD”



Instantly, I knew I had to open it. If there was any chance I could make it through the night without playing the countdown game, I would take it.



I rifled through old report cards and participation trophies. The box was dense, packed with various random trinkets and arts and crafts projects that I had acquired when I was young. Somehow, I had fond memories of none of them.



Just as I was about to give up my hunt, something in the disorganized box caught my eye. At first I thought it must have been packed in the wrong box.



It was an aged yellow folder with Adrienne’s name on it.



I opened the folder and found a stack of pages, identical in layout, each dated around twenty years ago.



Two names framed the header of each page.



*Adrienne, D. Morgan LCSW*



*Patient: Mark Cadello*



“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself.



I continued to skim the notes on each page using the light of the flickering fluorescent bulb. 



One read: “*Mark displays a pension for the imagination. He speaks of playing “games” with his imaginary friend. His social skills are steadily improving, although he still refuses to look me in the eye. I hope that he can continue to do well in school and befriend peers of his own age.”*



Another: “*Mark’s mood was sour today. I can’t blame him, Deborah mentioned that she had been admitted to the hospital again leaving no one to look after Mark while she was being held. Progress with his condition seems to have regressed. When I speak to him, his mind is elsewhere. Today he told me that his “friend” had instructed him to ignore me. I believe that he trusts his imaginary friend more than I.”*



The notes were all similar in tone, until the last.



It read: *“I believe that I have finally made a breakthrough with Mark. He struggles with discerning reality from fiction, but he is a brilliant and calculating child. Today I tapped into that potential by asking him to count back from one hundred, pausing for exactly one second between each number. I asked him to close his eyes and focus on himself, and when he finally opened them, he could be sure his surroundings were genuine. It worked flawlessly and afterwards we had our most authentic and raw conversation yet. I truly believe that this is the wind in our sails that Mark needed.”*



I dropped the papers to the floor. Goosebumps had crawled over my flesh long before I finished reading. Panicked, I unlocked my phone and opened my messages. 



There were no saved texts between myself and Adrienne. No recent calls or voicemails.



When I opened my photos, I could not find a single image of my fiancé. Places that I had sworn we had visited together she was absent from. My breathing grew heavy.



It was then when I noticed a dozen missed calls from my mom and a single voicemail. I steadied myself before pressing play.



“*Mark. Hey, it’s me. I know you’re probably mad at me right now and I get it. I shouldn’t have hidden anything from you.”*



She paused.



*“But I called Adrienne. She told me that you hadn’t gone to see her in over three years. I’m worried about you. Shit, Mark. I’m worried because I know that the games are real. I used to play them too. Mysteriously waking up at 3:17 AM. The hand over the side of the bed. Waiting till he was right behind you to sprint up the stairs. Mark, I’ve played with the monster too. That was before I understood. I wanted to keep you ignorant and happy, but I see that that was wrong of me. I should have trusted you with the truth. I know what you are going through, and I can help. I- You shouldn’t be alone right now. I'll be over as soon as I can. Hang in there baby. I love you.”*



When I tried to call back, it went straight to voicemail.



Shadows danced around me as my head began to spin. I turned to race out of the basement. I would wait on the porch until my mom arrived if I had to. But when I looked up from the bottom of the basement stairs I saw that the kitchen door had been shut. 



I sprinted to the top and tried the door. It wouldn’t budge. I slammed my fist against the wood over and over.



“Adrienne! Adrienne! Please, let me out!” 



I could only describe what I had been feeling at that moment as nightmarish. Or perhaps more accurately, it felt like those few dreadful moments after waking from a nightmare - disorienting and terrifying. Expect the moments never ended.



I kept waking to form new realizations and new horrible realities. My sense of truth had been so distorted and mangled that I didn’t know what to believe.



“You know what to do.” A voice responded from the other side of the door. It was so quiet that I wasn’t even sure that I heard it.



“No. I won’t play. I don’t want to!” I screamed back.



The entire house began to shake and a piercing sound cut into my ears.



“Then how will you ever know what is real?”



The voice spoke directly into my mind.



“Make it stop!” I cried, covering my ears.



I stumbled back down the steps. When I reached the base I staggered into the cement wall, sending a pile of boxes crashing to the ground. The entire basement had come alive. Everything moved. Everything spoke. And I just wanted it to stop.



I yanked the chain to turn off the light with so much force I nearly ripped it from its socket. 



“Okay! You win! I’ll play!”



As if in response to my exclamation, the sounds and chaos around me began to calm. It didn’t take long before there was only darkness and silence.



With my legs shaking, I made my way to the corner of the basement that I had cleared. I lowered myself to the ground, feeling the cool concrete on the sides of my calves as I crossed my legs.



Drawing in a steadying breath, I closed my eyes. And I began to count.



“One hundred. Ninety-Nine. Ninety-Eight.”



I didn’t even need to focus to ensure exactly a second passed between each number. It came as naturally to me as riding a bike.



“Eighty-Seven. Eighty-Six.”



I avoided thinking about the monster, about Adrienne, and about my mother. I focused on myself, alone in the dark basement.



“Seventy-One. Seventy. Sixty-Nine.”



With each second that I drew closer to zero, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel growing warmer. I had to play, I had to win.



“Fifty-Two. Fifty-One. Fifty.”



Halfway.



“Thirty-Eight. Thirty-Seven.”



All at once my repressed memories bubbled to the surface. I remembered the look in my mom’s eyes when I asked her if I wanted to play. I remember seeing Adrienne, my therapist the day before.



“Twenty-Six. Twenty-Five”



I feel something begin to swirl around me. It could hardly be called a touch. Still, I refuse to open my eyes.



“Nineteen. Eighteen.”



The monster draws near. I know that it's smiling. It’s salivating at the idea of me reaching zero.



“Seven. Six.”



My only thought is winning. 



“Five. Four. Three.”



When I get to zero I’ll be safe because I will finally be able to trust my eyes. I will know that what surrounds me is real.



“Two.”



I love you Adrienne. I hope that the woman that I know is waiting for me on the other side.



“One.”



I’m sorry mom, but I had to know. I needed the truth.



“Zero.”



I open my eyes. I am still facing  the corner of my basement, surrounded by shadow.



When I turn around I know he’s there. My monster, lurking in the darkness, ready to face me.



“I won.” I say into the void.

Hi! Im heading to see my favorite band in early May-- and staying at Origins. But now that I'm looking at things, I'm wondering if I should stay in Golden to have some additional things to do the day before and after the show? I would love to walk around during the day and shop or stop for coffee and curious if I should stay at The Eddy and be further from Red Rocks or just keep my reservation at Origins and just Uber to Golden for the day?

I'm a solo female coming from out of town so ofc safety is priority for me.

This is a buckelist thing for me. So just wanting to make the best out of it and see and do all I can.

Also, I planned to take a shuttle and Uber where needed but now curious if renting a car is better?

I appreciate any feedback. Thanks!",2,1744984172.0,RedRocks,4,1.0,False

Episode 7: Phobia Factor

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! The campers had their survival skills put to the test when they spent the entire night camping in the woods.""

""Katie and Sadie's friendship was strained when Katie's sense of direction got them totally lost. Duncan's mad ghost-story telling skills freaked out the Killer Bass, and bears showed up and the Gophers would've spent the night up in a tree if not for Brick and Dawn.""

""Cody peed in his pants and then it rained. Basically, no one got any sleep last night. Ultimately, the Killer Bass were the ones on the chopping block, leaving Katie without a marshmallow.""

""Yup, the challenge was rough alright, and if I have anything to say about it, today's will be even more brutal. Luckily, I do. What fresh horror have we planned for our campers? Find out next, on Total! Drama! Island!”

(Theme Song)

The scene opened to reveal Sadie still on the Dock of Shame crying as her tears drip into the lake, Mike standing beside her.

""Katie would want you to keep going,"" Mike tried to comfort Sadie, but she still continued to cry.

This irritated Mike enough to the point where he gasped into Chester. “Quit yer blubbering! Your friend didn't pass away, she left the island!”

Chester tried pulling Sadie away, which wasn't easy since she had a strong grip on the dock, but he was able to get Sadie off, causing her to snap off a piece of the wood.

""Katie! I miss you!"" Sadie cried.

The shot cut to the other eight remaining members of the Killer Bass seated around the campfire pit. The sound of crying got their attention and they looked to see Mike and Sadie walking towards them. Mike, who was no longer Chester, was carrying a loudly-crying Sadie, who was still holding on to the ripped piece of the dock.

They both sat down with Sadie hugging the piece of wood she had as Mike said ""It was a pretty long goodbye.”

Shawn noticed something that wasn't on-screen. ""Why are you guys here? Shouldn't you be sleeping?"" the conspiracy nut questioned as the scene showed the Screaming Gophers at the fire pit, with Beth holding up a plate of apple pie.

""We brought you some extra dessert after our tuck shoppe party,"" Brick said. ""We thought you might want some.""

Ezekiel gave them an odd look. ""Why?”

""Real talk,"" Lightning rolled his eyes. ""Owen stank up our cabin and we need some time to air out.""

As if on cue, Owen farted. ""Yuck!"" Sky complained.

Beth walked the apple pie past the fire and presented it to Ella. ""EEK!"" she yelled, slapping the plate away as soon as she realized it was close to her. It landed close to Cody, who bent over to pick up the plate – the pie itself had landed first, and was ruined.

""Chill. It's just an apple pie,"" the gap-toothed boy said, scooping up a handful of it.

""Sorry about that,"" Ella said. ""I just haven't been able to trust apples or anything related to it ever since I watched ‘Snow White’.""

""I know how you feel,"" Rodney told her. ""I don't like needles, even if my brothers have them in their rooms.""

""Pfft,"" Shawn scoffed. ""Why are you afraid of either of those things when we could get attacked by zombies any second?"" His eyes darted around the area nervously.

Confessional: Brick

“And then we were talking about our fears by the fire,"" Brick opened. ""Beth hates being covered in worms, Harold's afraid of ninjas, and Heather's frightened by sumo wrestlers.""

""Ever since I was born, I hated the dark,"" the cadet delved into his phobia. ""With the creaks, a-and the ‘Who's that?’, a-and the ‘Get away!’. The only reason I'm at the campsite right now is because there's a bonfire lighting the area, and I sleep with a nightlight by my side.”

Confessional Ends

The footage cut back to the campfire pit, where the Gophers were shown to be sitting around it with the Bass.

""My worst fear would have to be thunderstorms,"" Sky announced.

""Walking through a minefield,"" Lindsay said. “In heels.”

""Flying, man. That's some crazy stuff,"" Owen admitted.

""Robots,"" Dawn said firmly. ""They are not what the Earth Mother intended.”

""I'm scared of clowns, eh. Something about their makeup makes me uncomfortable,"" Ezekiel said.

Mike was next. ""Gophers.""

""Bad haircuts,"" Sadie said between sniffles.

""Oh, okay. I change mine!"" Lindsay spoke up again. ""That's so much scarier than a minefield!”

""Having to defuse a time bomb under pressure,"" Cody said.

""What are you afraid of, Duncan?"" Dawn asked.

Duncan looked worried as the eyes of the other campers were shown to be on him. ""C-Celine Dion music store standees..."" he muttered quickly.

""Ex-squeeze me?"" Cody chuckled. ""I didn't quite get that.""

""Did you say Celine Dion music store standees?"" Lightning asked.

""Ooh, I love Celine Dion!"" Lindsay spoke up before growing confused. ""What's a standee?""

""They're those cardboard cutout things that stand in front of a music store,"" Ezekiel explained.

""Don't... say it, dude!"" Duncan told Ezekiel with a glare.

""They're like a life-sized, but flat Celine,"" Ezekiel continued.

""Shut up!"" Duncan yelled. ""What about you guys?""

""I can't dig fire,"" Lightning replied. ""Well, I guess that’s everybody.""

The camera focused on the main lodge the next morning as Chris whistled to gain the teens' attention. ""Campers!"" he announced. ""Your next challenge is a little game I like to call 'Phobia Factor'! Prepare to face your worst fears!""

""Worse than this?"" Lightning stated, holding his meal with a fork.

""Now, for our first victims!"" Chris continued. He took a piece of paper out of his pocket and scanned it quickly. ""Heather! Meet us all in the theater! It's sumo time!""

Heather's eyes went wide and she did a spit take after drinking his coffee. The camera switched to show that Brick was the victim of the spit take, much to his unenjoyment.

Chris turned his attention to another player. “Sky! You and me have a date at the top of the cliff…while a thunderstorm comes brewing.” His words caused Sky to gasp.

""Wait, how did they know those were your worst fears?"" Lindsay got confused.

Sky remembered the campfire and slumped down. ""Because we told them.""

""At the campfire last night,"" Lightning said as the footage flashed back to the clip of Sky confessing her fear of thunderstorms.

“Wait. They were listening to us?” Lindsay asked.

""Girl, you cannot be that dumb. This is a reality TV show, so they're always watching and listening to everything we do,"" Lightning said.

""That's like…eavesdropping!"" Lindsay exclaimed.

""Chef Hatchet!"" Chris called. ""Didn't you have a special order for Mike here today?""

Chef grinned as he worked the fryer. He thrust a frying basket at the boy with a single object in it – something battered and fried in the shape of a gopher.

Trembling, Mike picked it up and the scene flashed back to show his fear of gophers. Mike looked at the item he was given, bringing it close to his mouth before biting it.

The comedian looked at the broken piece of the fried gopher, and the food burst out to reveal a small gopher, causing him to scream.

""That was hilarious, but you did take a bite out of it,"" Chris chuckled. “Your team gets a point.”

The scene cut ahead to Chris standing in front of a small inflatable pool with the campers gathered around it. The camera panned across the Bass who looked at the pool in disgust, before the clip of Brick mentioning Beth's fear in the confessional was replayed. The camera then panned over the Gophers, showing Owen fainting before ending on Beth.

The short girl shrugged and hopped the side of the pool, landing with a distinct squish amongst a writhing mass of worms. She emerged moments later none worse for wear, causing her teammates to cheer and earning a point for the Gophers on the on-screen scoreboard. ""And Beth sets the bar way up there!”

Lindsay and Sadie were shown next, sitting on a stool in the cafeteria as Chris arrived with two brown and tattered wigs. Sadie and Lindsay's shared fear was shown in another flashback, and just as Chris was about to put the wigs onto the girls, Owen snatched one of them and put it on his own head. The big guy pranced around for a bit before he tripped and hit the wall, and Chris quickly took the wig back and placed both onto the two girls’ heads.

Next was a pan over the Killer Bass who watched Rodney take his turn. He was shown looking scared as he backed up and ran away screaming. Chef Hatchet, holding a needle, chased after him.

Owen was next, his portion beginning with a flashback of his fear. Cutting back to the present, he was shown standing in front of a beat up plane in fear. Chef opened the door to reveal that he was wearing a female pilot outfit, and the scene flashed ahead to Owen screaming inside the flying plane.

The next clip showed Harold in one of the stalls reading a magazine when three figures disguised as ninjas tore through the roof and slid down their ropes to the ground. The dweeb opened the stall and had a staring contest with them before holding up a pair of nunchucks. He spun them around for a bit and started intimidating the ninjas before hitting himself in the head and knocking himself out.

""While he didn't defeat them,"" Chris announced, ""he didn't run away, so I'm counting it!"" The Bass got a second point.

The next clip was of Heather, trembling on stage as she stared at a sumo wrestler. The camera cut to show that every camper not already occupied by their personal challenge was watching her along with the host himself.

As the sumo wrestler came menacing towards Heather, in a quick form of thinking, she stuck out her foot, tripping the wrestler and sending him tumbling off-screen.

""Heather stepped up to the plate, scoring the Gophers their second point on the board!"" Chris declared. Both teams were tied at two points each.

Meanwhile, Owen was still wailing and screaming about as the plane started to fly upside down.

""Brick began his six-hours of solitude in the dark cabin feeling pretty confident,"" Chris explained over the cadet sitting alone in his own cabin with the lights turned off.

""I'm not scared,"" he told himself, though his eyes were darting around. ""I just have to stay strong and win this point!""

Sky was next, and she was inside a glass container at the top of the cliff as Chris and Cody stood next to her and a programmed cloud was above the container. Both contestants also had walkie talkies in their hands.

""This cloud above you is programmed to strike thunder,"" Chris told the athlete. ""Stay in this container to win, or just break the glass and lose.""

""On the plus side, Chris is letting a friend be with you,"" Cody reassured her.

""Thanks,"" Sky said gratefully.

Chris then pressed a button, and Sky steeled herself for her challenge as the sounds of thunder were heard.

(Commercial Break)

The footage focused on the next camper. Shawn's well-known fear of zombies was shown again as a means of transitioning to him standing alone in an oddly desolate part of the woods.

The walkie-talkie in his hands crackled and Chris's voice could be heard once more. ""Listen up! I went to the trouble of bringing a couple of these suckers to the island, and,"" he chuckled darkly, ""it looks like they really liked the interns if you know what I mean. Good luck!""

The transmission crackled to an end, but Shawn had already figured out what was going on. Thoroughly on-edge, he snapped his attention towards a handful of shuffling figures emerging from the forest around him. He uttered a single word before bolting for the nearest tree. ""Zombies!""

The camera cut ahead to Shawn clinging to the top of a tree. Below him, the group of zombies were slowly making their ascent.

""They can climb?!"" he exclaimed in horror. ""Everything I know is wrong!"" He quickly looked around, and spotted another tree close by. He jumped to it, and nearly bounced off as he desperately tried to grab a branch. He succeeded, but not for long – the impact and his weight caused the branch to snap and Shawn to fall to the undead below.

Eyes wide in fear, he tried to scramble away from them but was stopped by another tree. ""Okay..."" he muttered nervously, ""time for the plan of last resort."" He took a deep breath, uttered a battle cry, and charged the zombies.

A montage of kicks, punches, and ill-advised headbutts was shown as Shawn fought his way through the zombies. Strangely, most of the allegedly-mindless things turned and fled in a rather lively fashion. Shawn paid no notice, clobbering zombie after zombie until he stood before a particularly well-put-together one. He went for a punch, but the zombie just ducked and cowered.

""Why'd you duck down?"" Shawn asked in confusion. He looked back at the zombie's he'd already beaten and the one before him and came to a swift conclusion. ""Wait a minute, you aren't zombies at all!""

The “zombie” took off their rubber mask to reveal an intern as the other interns groaned and did the same.

""Oh man, that was awesome!"" Chris said, stepping out from behind a tree. ""But yeah, dude, no zombies on the island, I promise."" Shawn glared at the host even as the scoreboard dinged to show 3-2 in the Bass’ favor.

The camera cut back to Sky still in the glass box as Cody stood nearby, the cloud rumbling and blasting out lightning bolts. Sky yelped everytime a thunderstrike occurred.

""You’re alright, Sky,"" Cody consoled her. ""Only a couple more minutes.""

""And then I can leave, right?"" Sky asked.

""Of course,"" Cody said. “If it'll help, you can talk to me about anything. As a way to distract you from the thunderstorm.”

""Okay,"" Sky agreed. “So my sister, Jane, has a boyfriend named Jim, but before they got together, there was this school dance, and Jane went to ask Jim out.”

“That doesn't seem too bad,” Cody said.

“But Jane admitted to Jim that she had a crush on him first,” Sky continued.

Cody's eyes went wide. “What?”

""Who stares at a guy and says ‘I like you’?"" Sky asked rhetorically. ""That's not how it works. You're supposed to write it on a note and give it to a friend of the person you like. Then he tries to pass it to the guy, gets caught by the teacher, and the teacher reads it out loud into class. Everybody knows that!""

""Did Jane even get to go to the dance with her boyfriend?"" Cody wondered.

""She did, but they mostly didn't talk to each other at the event,"" Sky claimed.

“That does sound kind of bad, but you have to give her points for actually getting into a relationship with someone,” Cody complimented. “And they're happily dating, right?”

“Correct,” Sky agreed.

An alarm went off, and Chris appeared. ""Nice job Sky! You lasted the full hour,"" he said as he turned off the cloud, and the scoreboard increased one point for the Gophers.

Confessional: Sky

""Cody has been really nice to me,"" Sky informed the confessional camera. ""But I'm not here to meet boys. I'm here to win,"" she said seriously, though a blush formed on her face.

Confessional Ends

Cody's fear was shown again before transitioning to him standing next to three tied up trash cans in the woods, which had a bomb and timer on it. ""Alright, Cody. This garbage bomb's going off in exactly ten minutes. Everything you need to know to diffuse it is on these schematic blueprints,"" Chris held up the aforementioned object.

""What?! No way!"" Cody exclaimed. ""I can't do this!""

""Then, uh,"" Chris laughed, ""I suggest you find a safe place to hide, brah. Later, dude.""

Cody was handed the blueprints. ""Wait. You're not gonna watch?""

""No way! That's a live bomb, dude!"" Chris answered and ran away.

Duncan's clip was presented, and it cut to Duncan standing in front of a life-sized cardboard cutout Celine Dion standee, Chris and the Killer Bass members watching from afar.

""Just one hug, and you're done,"" Chris told him.

""T-That looks really... real, man,"" Duncan stuttered.

""She's made of cardboard!"" Shawn yelled. “And she's not a zombie!”

""It's ok if you can't do it,"" Rodney said.

""I'll try,"" Duncan said. He took a deep breath and started running toward the standee with open arms. The delinquent wrapped the standee in a hug, prompting his teammates to cheer for him and their added point.

""Ha! I did it!"" Duncan hollered.

Dawn's clip was shown next, and the scene changed to Dawn sitting on a log when she heard a stomp. She turned around and saw a robot that looked like it had come from a several-decades-old science fiction story. She promptly screamed and ran away. As the aura whisperer ran screaming, the camera panned over to show Chris watching nearby.

""How did you even get that robot here?"" Ezekiel wondered nearby.

""All it took was a bribe,"" Chris grinned. ""But I think you've got your own problems to worry about right now.""

Ezekiel raised an eyebrow, and the sound of a honking horn got his attention. Slowly, he turned around.

""Hiya! I heard you could use some cheering up!"" It was a male clown, all done up in white makeup and full goofy costume, holding a couple balloons. Ezekiel screamed and ran. ""I only wanted to show him a few balloon tricks!"" the clown exclaimed.

“And since he did not stay and watch, Ezekiel doesn't get the point,” Chris added before an explosion shook him.

""If I have to guess, I'd say Cody just blew himself up,"" Chris smiled as the shot moved to Cody feeling dizzy. He was also covered from head to toe in garbage.

""Oops. Is anyone here? Girls? Ladies? Anyone?!"" Cody mumbled before he walked through the woods uncontrollably.

The camera cut over to Brick, who was still inside his dark cabin. ""I'm bigger than the dark… I'm better than the dark…"" A whimper can be heard from him.

Chris then came inside the cabin and turned on the lights. ""It's been six minutes. You're good to go,"" Chris announced while a point for the Gophers was earned.

Brick let out a sigh of relief before passing out and falling asleep on his own bunk bed.

The plane had finally landed on the ground, and Owen was glad to get off the plane as the Gophers gained a point.

Sadie and Lindsay were inside the communal bathroom, and their time to wear the wigs were up.

“We did it!” Lindsay celebrated while they looked at their reflections in the mirror. “We made it through the whole day!”

“Ready? One... two... three!” Sadie counted off before they took their wigs off, and they started to gasp.

“I totally forgot how cute you are!” Lindsay said to Sadie.

“Oh my gosh! You are too!” Sadie said back.

The scene cut to a nervous looking Lightning standing apart from the other campers. He stood frowning at a pile of books, CDs, video tapes, and other assorted merchandise stamped with the face of Chris McLean. Chef whistled as he doused the pile with gasoline.

""Alright gang, we're in the ninth inning,"" Chris said and focused on Lightning. ""Lightning,"" he put a hand on the uber-jock's shoulder, ""all you have to do is watch all of the stuff I've ever regretted doing burn to ashes without looking away. Do you understand?""

Lightning nodded, and so did the host. Chef lit a match, and started the bonfire.

An oddly touching tune was played over several shots of Lightning watching the memorabilia get destroyed, the flames reflecting in his increasingly terrified eyes.

The camera focused in on the case of burning video tape, the area around the hosts' smiling face slowly being consumed.

""NO!"" a voice cried out, using a fire extinguisher to take out the flames and rescue the tape.

It was Chris himself. ""Even if it is just a pile of embarrassing memories,"" he cried as he pulled more and more things out of the fire, ""I can't bear to watch my face be destroyed like this!""

""Does this mean I get the point?"" Lightning asked.

""Yes!"" Chris exclaimed. ""Just help me with this, will ya?""

The footage skipped ahead to Chris standing in front of the campers. ""We've got one more challenge set up, and this one is suited for Ella,"" she winked at her direction.

Ella became uncomfortable. ""Wait, you don't mean…""

Ella mentioning her fear of apples was shown again, and the camera flashed to everyone surrounded by a pool of apple juice being stirred by Chef. A diving board was set up behind the pool.

""Your final challenge is to dive into the pool of apple juice,"" Chris described the challenge. ""Doing so will earn your team a point.""

Ella was feeling timid and scared at what she was about to do. ""Wait! Even if I do make the jump, my team will still be a point behind!"" she protested heavily. ""Six points won't beat the Gophers' seven.""

""Let's make this interesting, then. I'll give you three points if you can complete it,"" Chris upped the ante.

Ella looked at the pool one last time. ""Oh dear,"" she gulped before climbing up the ladder.

""Don't think about the juice too much!"" Mike motivated his friend.

""Okay then,"" Ella nodded and got on the diving board. She looked down and saw how far the drop was going to be, increasing her nerves.

""I can't do this! I'm coming down!"" Ella panicked from the apple juice and climbed back down, causing the Bass to hang their heads in shame and the Gophers to celebrate.

""And there you have it. The Gophers win invincibility this week. Again!"" Chris declared.

Confessional: Rodney

“Ella's in danger tonight,” Rodney confessed. “However, I know something that will keep her in.”

Confessional Ends

The scene cut to Owen in the pool of apple juice. ""Wow,"" he chuckled. ""It is warm."" He then slowly sank to the bottom.

The standard dramatic music played over a shot of the moon, which panned down to show two marshmallows remaining on the plate atop the sole vacant log. ""There are only two marshmallows left on this plate,"" Chris said as the camera zoomed out to reveal Rodney, Ezekiel, and Ella sitting closest to the host.

""The three of you did not complete your challenges today,"" Chris continued as the camera focused in on the three losing contestants and their nervous looks. ""One of you is going home tonight and cannot return. Ev-er."" The host smiled in a close-up. ""The next name I'm gonna call..."" he paused as each of the three camper's faces were shown, ""is...Ezekiel!"" The prairie boy was shown smiling as he walked over to claim his treat, and Ella and Rodney shared a look of dread.

""The final marshmallow of the night goes to..."" Chris began again. ""Ella!""

""What?!"" Ella exclaimed. ""But how?!""

""I told the guys to vote for me,"" Rodney explained to her. “That's all there is to it.”

“But why would you do that?” Ella questioned the country boy.

""You were likely gonna go home, and I wanted to make up for thinking that you liked me,"" Rodney admitted. “Besides, I also didn't face my fear as well.” He stood up and began to walk out. ""Thanks for voting me off, guys.""

Confessional: Ella

“Rodney sacrificed himself to keep me in the competition,” Ella mentioned. “He really is a noble boy, and even though I'm not attracted to him, I will atone for my blunder that led to our loss and make sure his sacrifice is not in vain.”

She threw things around the house all week and did her ""rage cleaning"" this morning while mumbling about me to most likely get a reaction out of me while I was sitting in the living room.

One time I left the water filter out on the counter and she left a note on my bedroom door saying ""put the water back in the fridge or you're not finishing college"". Or she will threaten to kick me out for leaving a shirt or any belongings around by accident (I have diagnosed ADHD that my mom doesn't believe) so I'm very forgetful and I get called lazy and useless a lot.

I stay in my room to avoid her and her outbursts and somehow I'm still repsonsible for her anger and I'm horrible to her despite ""doing nothing"" and ""spending all my time in my room"" and ""never talking to her"" so she's already contradicting herself lmao.

From detecting trends before they go viral to executing trades in the blink of an eye, it’s transforming how investors and CEOs conquer the markets. This isn’t just about automation. It’s a revolution in intelligence, strategy, and results.

[AI in Stock Trading](https://preview.redd.it/l7vgk5gsklve1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e01a616d4d65dcc76bb5c0b033cdb77ed0eeb1c0)

# Why is AI becoming the secret weapon of modern-day traders and investors?

Let’s peel back the curtain and explore why AI in Stock Trading is quietly reshaping the way investors, analysts, and decision-makers approach the market with more precision and power than ever before.

**Because it’s no longer just a buzzword, it’s Wall Street’s new brain**

Once seen as a futuristic concept reserved for tech geeks and hedge funds, AI in Stock Trading has now entered the mainstream. It’s quietly disrupting age-old trading strategies and replacing gut-feel decisions with precision-based automation.

And it’s doing so with alarming efficiency.

AI is doing to traditional stock trading what GPS did to printed maps which is rendering them obsolete, one algorithm at a time.

From real-time sentiment analysis to predictive forecasting, AI is taking over not just how trades are executed, but why they’re made.

If you're a CEO, CTO, investor, or portfolio manager, the message is clear: Get ahead of the AI curve or get left behind.

**The evolution from human intuition to machine intelligence**

Not long ago, a good trader needed a sixth sense; a mix of experience, instinct, and maybe a little caffeine-induced luck. But now, success hinges on data accuracy, speed, and pattern recognition, which AI does exponentially better.

* AI doesn't sleep
* AI doesn’t panic in volatile markets
* AI sees patterns humans simply can’t

It digests billions of data points in real-time, identifies anomalies, and executes trades at the speed of thought or faster.

So, what does this mean for modern-day investors?

It means the edge is no longer emotional intelligence, it’s algorithmic intelligence. It’s about integrating a system that can think, learn, and act all while sipping your morning coffee.

Let’s break down how to harness this edge, what tools you’ll need, and what pitfalls to avoid in your AI in Stock Trading journey.

# How does AI actually work in stock trading behind the scenes?

To understand the true power of AI in Stock Trading, we need to look beneath the surface and follow the data trail that fuels every intelligent decision.

**It all starts with data. And lots of it.**

At the heart of every AI-powered trading strategy is data. Tons of it. We’re talking about:

* Market price history
* Trading volumes
* Social media sentiment
* News headlines
* Financial reports
* Macroeconomic indicators

AI uses this to train models, spot patterns, and make informed predictions.

Think of AI like a trader with 100,000 eyes, scanning markets, news, and trends simultaneously.

**Key AI techniques used in trading today:**

These aren’t just buzzwords from a tech conference. They’re the engines driving today’s most powerful AI trading systems, each with their own roles in turning raw data into real-time decisions.

1: Machine Learning (ML):

* Uses historical data to forecast future prices and trends
* Learns from past trades and adapts without manual input

2: Natural Language Processing (NLP):

* Analyzes news articles, tweets, and even Reddit threads to measure market sentiment
* Detects shifts in investor mood before markets react

3: Deep Learning (Neural Networks):

* Mimics human brain functions to find hidden patterns
* Effective in predicting price volatility and automating high-frequency trading

4: Reinforcement Learning:

* A trial-and-error approach where the algorithm learns strategies over time, improving with every trade

**Real-world application of AI in trading:**

While theory shows us the potential, these real-world applications prove just how deeply [AI in Stock Trading](https://kodytechnolab.com/blog/ai-in-stock-trading/) is already woven into the strategies of global financial powerhouses.

* **JP Morgan’s LOXM:** Executes trades with minimal market impact
* **BlackRock’s Aladdin:** Manages over $21 trillion in assets using AI risk analysis

**JP Morgan’s LOXM**

JP Morgan developed an AI-powered trading engine called LOXM, designed to execute large trades with minimal market disruption. Instead of pushing large orders into the market all at once (which can move prices), LOXM smartly breaks them down and times each part to get better pricing. It’s like having a trader who never gets tired, never second-guesses, and always aims for the most efficient result.

**BlackRock’s Aladdin**

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, runs its operations using an AI-driven platform called Aladdin. This system helps manage risk, analyze portfolios, and make data-backed investment decisions across more than $21 trillion in assets. From scanning market changes to stress-testing portfolios, Aladdin acts like a digital brain behind BlackRock’s global investment machine.

The takeaway? This isn't theory, this is practice.

# How to use AI in stock market trading the smart way?

Understanding the strategy is only half the battle. To truly unlock the potential of AI in Stock Trading, you need a clear roadmap that turns ideas into intelligent action.

Step-by-step: From concept to execution

There’s a misconception that AI in Stock Trading is only for billion-dollar hedge funds. Not true. Whether you're an individual trader, financial startup, or mid-size enterprise, implementing AI is possible and profitable if you follow the right framework.

Let’s break it down in simple, actionable steps.

**A Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing AI in Stock Trading Operations:**

Building an AI-powered trading system involves defining clear objectives, collecting and preparing quality data, choosing the right tech stack, training and validating models, running thorough backtests, and gradually deploying into live markets with continuous monitoring and refinement.

**Define Your Objective:**

Are you building a predictive model? Risk management tool? A sentiment analyzer?

Clear goals help narrow your AI approach.

**Gather High-Quality Data:**

This includes structured data (prices, indicators) and unstructured data (news, social posts).

Garbage in = garbage out.

**Choose the Right Tech Stack:**

Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn

Consider cloud platforms like AWS or Azure for scalability

**Build & Train Your Model:**

Supervised or unsupervised? Regression or classification? Choose based on your trading logic.

Validate the model against historical data.

**Backtest Like Crazy:**

Test your AI model using past data to simulate real-world scenarios.

Refine based on success metrics like Sharpe Ratio and ROI.

**Deploy in a Sandbox Environment:**

Monitor your AI’s performance before going live.

Protect your capital while the model learns in real-time.

**Go Live & Scale:**

Start with small volumes.

Folate from 7.6 to 11.2ng/ml
B12 from 316 to 450pg/ml
Ferritin from 54 to 61ng/ml 
Fasting glucose 89 to 87


I have also lost 12-13 pounds and achieved these results by eating WAY fewer carbs and sugar, way more meat, eggs and veg, taking D+K2, collagen powder with allulose in coffee, and a multivitamin. My moods are better, my periods have become a LITTLE more regular, my hair doesn’t get greasy QUITE as fast, sleep is better, bloating is way better. I’m also using a CGM to learn how foods affect my body though I am not diabetic. 


On the downside, my iron dropped from 96 to 68. If anyone has insight to this and in relation to the ferritin, I would love to hear. Also very sadly, my DHEA has gone from 204 to 321!!

1k252s0,https://i.redd.it/tlc1va97jlve1.png,Help dialling in,"I've been enjoying brewing with a V60 for some years. Some days ago I decided to try out a moka pot I had lying around. It's an unlabelled rather large pot that I can fit 400g water in, and 40g coffee. The coffee was awfully bitter. Instead of dialling in with the large pot, I bought a 3-cup (130ml) Bialetti Moka Express today. So far, these are my results:
(Dots are referring to dots on my grinder, see the image for reference. Leftmost dot = dot 1)

130g water + 13g coffee, dot 1 : Very sour. 
130g water + 16g coffee, dot 1 : Bitter and sour?!
130g water + 16g coffee, dot 4 : Sour with a bitter aftertaste)
130g water + 18g coffee, dot 1 : Mainly bitter, but I'd say sour with a bitter aftertaste. 

For every brew I've been pre-boiling the water, placing the pot on a cold Bialetti induction adapter, setting the stove to 6 out of 14, reducing to 1 when coffee appears, and cooling the bottom part under cold running water at the first sign of sputtering. 
Each brew took about 5,5 - 6 minutes until coffee appeared. 
I levelled the grounds by shaking/tapping the basket. I do not tamp. 

I've been trying to use the [coffee compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/) to understand what to do with the different results. 
Of course, I can't go finer than dot 1 on my grinder. Going for 1:10 (13g coffee) leaves a lot of room in the basket so I'm reluctant to reduce the amount. 

As shown in the picture, I use a Wilfa Svart Aroma grinder, (mainly) set to the finest setting. 

As for coffee, I use a locally light roasted Ethiopian washed bean. The taste profile is described as: *A juicy and floral coffee with a sweet aroma of peach and bergamot. Tastes of grapefruit, black tea and violet. Long aftertaste of dark chocolate. *

---

- How should I move forward for dialling in the recipe? It feels wasteful to keep missing, but that might just be the cost of getting to a good tasting cup of coffee. 
- Is it ok to leave room for air in the basket?
- I thought sour and bitter were opposites (over/under extraction). How can my coffee taste both?

And my coworker would not stop trying to get my attention to make side comments. When I am super focused on something I just tune out everything else, I go into like a different mode. Like if I responded to her in any way in would break my concentration, I'd have to break my ""trance""/talk myself which is rude, it'd be super frustrating, and I would've missed something that the speaker said :( But after 2 hours of the presentation, she called me out for it in a pretty aggressive way!

And then she got mad when she was trying to go up and talk to him... she was rambling on about random stuff to him in an excited way which he was nice enough but I could tell he was trying to move away from us and I almost didn't get to say my piece to him so I chased him a little bit because I actually wanted to network and see if he could come to my project service area at some point. I got my words and he gave me the info I needed, but by coworker freaked out and told my boss (who was at the presentation) she needed to talk to her about me because she felt like I just wanted her to ""shut up"". I know this because my boss told me after the presentation (and after my coworker stormed out of the building because my boss didn't have time to meet her at a coffee shop to talk about me). Anyway, my boss reassured me that I'm not in trouble, things are being blown out of proportion, and gave me the day off work today since it's been a long week which I'm grateful for.

This coworker exudes extremely chaotic energy and it's not just me that notices it. I am super kind and responsive to her nearly any other time, but not when I'm in a meeting/listening to a speaker, like c'mon I thought that was common sense :( Also for context we both became coworkers last Fall with a new position at the company and work remote a lot of the time, but see each other in person usually 1-3 times a month, but this week was different because we had an in person multi day conference. I don't think she especially likes working remote because it seems like she needs to constantly be talking to people. I thrive in the remote space mixed in with some in-person.

he listed the songs, track by track, best to worst, giving them a general grade, which is anaverage rating based on three other grades:

* music /10

* lyrics /10
* general personal appreciation of the song /10



excepttttt for ONE song he was unable to rate (can you guess the song?? more on that later)



his general average rating for the album is 5.33/10. He says it could deserve a bit more, but it's also very generous



he took notes as he was listening to the entire thing



we're french so i'll try my best to translate his critique so you guys can enjoy it. There might be some private jokes that i'll remove for more clarity. Or I'll try to explain them using bold text



here we go !!!!





\#1 : ***Song 4: Homes.***

  
Please, don’t mess up this intro, it’s really cool.  
And yeah, the voice, huh…  
Yeah yeah! It’s not bad!  
Ah yes, it’s a song by Flo **(I'm Flo, and I make music too, and it's heavily influenced by csh)**  
The music is a big yes, damn.  
6:30? That might be the song that went by the fastest, damn.

  
**Enjoyment level after first listen:**  
8.17/10. **BANGER.**

  
And for the breakdown (it helps to see the criteria):  
**Music:** 8/10  
**Lyrics:** 7.5/10

**Overall appreciation of the track:** 9/10





\#2 : ***Song 20: Knife in the Coffee***

  
Yeah, it’s got some movement!  
Pure enjoyment. There’s a bit of Dylan, a bit of the Beatles, a bit of stuff I don’t know, but it’s cool.  
The lyrics are nice.

**8/10**





\#3 : ***Song 6: Jerks***

  
5:30 and he starts off with a guitar that’s out to kill me. We’re off to a great start.  
Ugh, the voice… Still not working. Even with the distortion (?).  
AH! Why not.  
Yeah, actually.  
Even when it could get lost in *exactly* what I don’t like about his stuff — the emptiness — he adds those *Woohoos* so my crack-addled brain still has something to latch onto.  
Okay, the ending hits hard, but it’s a bit long. Gotta know when to stop.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:**  
A very solid **7.33/10**







\#4 : ***Song 10: I Can Play the Piano***

  
What does this remind me of? I don’t know. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s really nice.  
It gets a bit long at times, but for once, not in a way that hurts the song.  
The lyrics aren’t that amazing, but the rest carries it.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:7.31/10**







**#5 :** ***Song 11: Crows (Rest in Bigger Pieces)***

  
When he really tears up his voice, it’s great.  
And even the way he uses his voice throughout the whole song — that’s new. I don’t think I’ve heard him do that before.  
Hmm, are they stepping out of their usual style? It’s not unpleasant... The music is nice.  
WHOA IT’S *DEAD OR ALIVE*!  
This one’s surprising — I like it!  
It holds my attention all the way through.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:7.2/10**





\#6 : ***Song 5: Afterglow***

  
Musically, it starts off pretty well again. And I really like the way he sings here.  
The voice isn’t nearly as unpleasant. Not at all, actually.  
Still, I do get a little bored. It loses steam.  
Kinda sounds like a slightly messed-up Moby in some parts — or am I just deaf? (Yes.)  
Too bad it runs out of steam. And at the same time, he didn’t have five minutes in this song, so it shows.  
If he throws repetitive loud sounds in my ears one more time, his next album’s gonna be my last.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:6.67/10**





\#7 : ***Song 1: Boxing Day***

  
Nice, it starts off with holiday season — good atmosphere again.  
But dude, the intro sounds like a car alarm...  
Yeah, just as I suspected, the real issue is the voice.  
Aight, “I feel so haunted” — not bad when he holds it properly. That whole part actually isn’t bad at all.  
Weirdly enough, the second part of the song is way more pleasant. I dare say it almost sounds like a mellow Pixies song.  
It’s not unpleasant, but I’m still kinda bored.  
Okay, given the production — makes me wanna die from the cymbals — but I’m not docking points for that.  
When he really goes up vocally, it sounds like Remy Zero. I don’t know what that says about me, or Remy Zero, or Car Seat Headrest — but there it is.  
There are four songs crammed into this one song. And two out of four aren’t bad.  
“There’s a skill I’d like to steal” — devilishly clever.  
Heh, yep, I’m bored again. In the same song, it’s wild.  
“Promise me you’ll go outside when I leave ‘cause I don’t want you hanging around” — both times, it hit me. Johnny Cash-level delivery.  
There are still two minutes left?

Alright, it’s too long and messy for me, but it told me something.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:6/10**





\#8 : ***Song 17: Death at the Movies***  
When his voice sounds like this, I actually kind of like it.  
The lyrics are still nice. But I can’t help finding it repetitive — even within the song itself.  
In some tracks, including this one, there’s a bit of a *punk Bowie* vibe — or am I just being dumb?

**Enjoyment level after first listen:5.83/10**









\#9 : ***Song 12: I Wanna Sweat***

  
They’re good at hooks, gotta give them that.  
But man, the voice — every time.  
Okay, I’m a little bored and it’s not really my style, but it’s not bad, and it doesn’t make me suffer like *The Gun Song* did.  
The lyrics are still nice, and it’s not unpleasant to listen to.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:5.78/10**







\#10 : ***Song 9: Goodbye Love***

  
Of course, the one song where he does something good is under two minutes long.  
But it’s really nice.

  
Hard to rate:

**Enjoyment level after first listen:5.67/10** — too bad, it ruins everything.







\#11 : ***Song 13: Burning Man***  


I’ll say it a lot, but this one starts exactly in that spot I find a bit annoying with this band.  
And unfortunately, that’s confirmed.  
Once again, the lyrics are really good, but the rest just doesn’t speak to me at all.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:4.89/10**







\#12 : ***Song 3: Don't Remind Me***

  
The voice plus the effect really doesn’t work for me.  
Actually, the lyrics are good. I can admit that. It’s the musical arrangement that leaves me cold as hell.  
Dude... Another alarm?  
The more he screams “no,” the more I feel like this song never really starts.



**Enjoyment level after first listen:4.67/10**





\#13 : ***Song 2: We Can’t Afford (Your Depression)***

  
I didn’t see the depression theme coming, it’s not exactly his usual vibe ???  
The voice suits this one better, but it’s still a dealbreaker for me.  
It left me feeling very cold. From one line to the next, his voice can either ruin the track or work really well on me.

  
**Enjoyment level after first listen:4.33/10**









\#14 : ***Song 7: Broken Birds (Rest in Pieces)***

  
The music is getting better.  
And the voice? Is it getting better too? It’s still not my thing, but at least it’s becoming less of a drag on my enjoyment.  
8:21... Of course.  
For now, there’s nothing, it’s long, and I’m bored.  
For now, there’s nothing, it’s long, and I’m bored.  
There’s not much going on, it stretches in my sense of time, I’m just getting bored.  
J. (**his wife**) called me during this song, my girl saved me…  
This one really sounds like a fake song from *The Sopranos*.  
I like the music more at the end.  
The theme speaks to me a bit, but it’s not amazing.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:4/10**







\#15 : ***Song 18: Jus' Tired*** **(uhhhh, me too)**

  
Oh, it’s calm. Ugh, is this another song like *Big Jacket*?  
It’s not calm, it’s just *MUSHY*.  
The little trumpet in the background helps a lot.  
Ah, too bad, it’s gone.  
Actually, these are moments I’ve lived through a lot in these kinds of songs. I get the feeling, but just like *those* moments, I don’t think it’s worth it.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:4/10**









**#16** : ***Song 14: Dreams Fall Hard***

  
If it’s 6:30 of this, I think it’s a solid 4.89/10 again without recalculating, I feel like I’m reliving the same moment.  
But no, the ending is torture. Two minutes of that, dude. It loses a point, it’s just unbearable.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:3.89/10**









\#17 : ***Song 16: Big Jacket***

  
“You can have my lack of drive to continue listening to thiiis song”  
5 minutes, damn... You don’t have 5 minutes of song, don’t make a 5-minute song.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:2.60**







\#18 : ***Song 19: Some Strange Angel***

  
Well, there’s nothing to break down here. I don’t like it, and after all the songs I didn’t like, it’s clear exactly why I don’t like this one either.

**Enjoyment level after first listen:2.5/10**







\#19 : ***Song 15: Plane Crash Blues (I Can’t Play the Piano)***

  
I feel like the songs never really start, and that’s fine if it’s enjoyable to listen to from the get-go. But here, I’m getting nothing out of it.  
Yeah, no, here... He talks, then he screams...

**Enjoyment level after first listen:2.40/10**









and finally, here's his review of *The Gun Song* :



***Song 8: The Gun Song - No Trigger Version***

  
Well, here we’re really in the kind of song of theirs I’m not too into.  
Oh? Maybe in 15 minutes, a part of it will click with me.  
Like right now, a tiny bit more.  
I’ll do a summary at the end, but the guitar solo here is cool. The build-up.  
Alright, as a final take:  
What a journey. I feel like I just listened to the movie *Under the Silver Lake*. I love the idea of having the freedom to write and sing a track this big. He did what he wanted, no one can stop him from doing that, props for that. But no one will ever force me to listen to this shit again. It was torture.There’s nothing in this song for me, except for a little guitar solo and 15 seconds of vocals I liked.

I asked chatgpt to put together my death in the final destination and guys… he killed it and even scared me a lot.,"The Original Disaster — “Neurotech 2040: The Future of the Mind”

Location: A futuristic convention center, where an international experimental technology fair is taking place. The environment is ultra modern, full of LED lights, interactive installations and mechanisms that simulate brain responses in real time.

Disaster averted: During a live presentation of an augmented reality sensory capsule, the cooling system fails. The temperature rises, causing explosions in high-voltage cables. A flammable gas leaks from neurostimulation equipment. Sparks + gas = a sequence of explosions that destroy an entire wing of the convention center. Screens fall, glass flies, and the sensory capsule becomes a death trap.

You are 4th on the list of dead. You escape after feeling severe vertigo and a metallic crack (your cue to run). Chaos explodes seconds later.

⸻

His Death — “Final Espresso”

Location: A conceptual coffee shop attached to a cult bookstore, burnt concrete walls, industrial furniture. You are there reviewing photos of the event, trying to understand how you escaped death.

Death sequence:
	1. A barista is changing a light bulb with an aluminum ladder. The wiring there is old and poorly maintained.
	2. A customer drops a glass of juice near an exposed outlet behind the counter, causing a short.
	3. This trips the coffee shop's power box, which starts sparking.
	4. The scare makes the barista lose his balance and drop a small glass lamp straight onto his table.
	5. The impact breaks one of the legs of the chair you are sitting on.
	6. You fall backwards, hit your head on the floor and, in an attempt to get up, bump into a metal shelf with packets of coffee beans stacked high.
	7. One of the packages falls and accidentally activates an automatic industrial grinder — a loose gear from the mill flies like a blade.
	8. It hits your windpipe. Clean cut. You try to choke out one last breath as the coffee maker, ironically, continues to run behind you.

Death #4 confirmed.
Official cause: cervical trauma caused by a moving sharp object.

⸻

Sinister detail:
The camera focuses on a broken cup next to him. It says: “Time always finds a way.”

First things first – I’m aware that manual machines come with a learning curve, but it seems like my milk steaming isn't improving at all, even after 15 tries. The milk just ends up looking like warm milk, with no foam whatsoever.

1k24r9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1k24r9w/my_experience_ive_seen_enough/,My experience - I've seen enough,"I’d like to share what happened during my most recent interview process. If you’re in the mood to laugh-or help me make sense of it-read on.

I applied for a “Coordinator of Language Services” position at a company offering translations and language classes. The next day, this HR lady called to schedule an online interview the next day. During the online call, the recruiter asked standard questions (salary expectations, what I thought the role entailed) and gave me a brief overview. This one question felt simple and basic “Give me three characteristics an ideal candidate should have.” At the end, she said she’d send me two tests to complete over the weekend. One was a basic personality test, the other repeated questions from the interview, with a few situational questions and math problems.

After two days, she called again, said she was happy with my answers, and invited me for a second interview in person but added that the original position had been filled. She asked me to check their website for another opening. When I did, I realized it was the same job I originally applied for. The next day, I emailed her to clarify that I had applied for that job from the beginning and that I’d be happy to proceed to the next round. Up until this point, the communication had been smooth, but somewhere in the middle of our email conversation, she suddenly took four days to reply.

Second round

She brought me into a meeting room/classroom and asked me to wait. She left her notebook and some papers on the desk and walked out. I happened to glance at the papers-one of them was my printed CV with handwritten notes. She had written some numbers I didn’t understand. I only recognized the number I had listed as my salary expectation and another that seemed to be her guess at my age (which was wrong—she must’ve estimated based on my graduation year).

She came back with two glasses of water, and the conversation began.

She had a full sheet of questions prepared. The first half of the interview consisted of questions she had already asked me during the first call-salary, three characteristics, and what I thought the role entailed (so this is my third time actually answering them). Then she mentioned that the job is more of a project management position rather than a coordinator role. I know titles don’t always mean much, but why the sudden change? To make the role seem more interesting? 

In the middle of the interview, she asked if I had any questions. I was particularly curious about the afternoon shift that would be a once-a-week occurance which she had briefly mentioned earlier. So, I asked her what time it starts and ends. Her answer was vague. She started talking in circles and repeating things she had already said. I never found out when the shift actually starts, only that it ends at 7 pm and that the team collectively decides who takes it and when. (Smells like “we’ll force you into unpaid overtime”).  I also asked her which stage of the interview process we were in. She said this was the second and final interview.

  
Second part of the interview

Imo some of her questions were quite absurd but lmk if you think they serve a real purpose.

1. “If you woke up tomorrow and found out you were a house, what kind of house would you be?”
2. “Tell me your three favorite animals and list three qualities you like about each of them.”
3. She asked if she could ask me a personal question (and said I didn’t have to answer). She asked how many siblings I have and whether they were older or younger. (I answered.)
4. “Where do you see yourself in five years?” (She admitted this was a bit of a dated question. I don’t mind it, just found it boring.)

At the end, I asked more questions. Since she told me this was the final round, I asked if I would get to meet the manager before signing a contract. She began her answer with: “Well, there is no manager.”  
She explained that the CEO would technically be my manager and emphasized that the company isn’t super small, but not large either—over 60 employees at this location, which is their headquarters. (They have other offices internationally which I googled after). The team has 11 women, no manager. She also made a weird comment about how she doesn’t really understand why, but men seem to struggle in this role???

When I asked about benefits, she listed what aren’t benefits lol. The list of actual perks went something like: coffee and tea in the office, the legal minimum number of vacation days plus one extra, and one day of home office per week (but you don’t know which day-it’s decided collectively by the team on the Friday before).

She probably thought she ate with her questions. I thanked her for her time and left. Now we wait for her decision.

Based on the reviews I’ve read online and my personal experience, I think I formed a clear picture of this company. Actually I laugh about this experience with my friends.

**Why Your Morning Coffee is a Weight-Loss Buddy**

That cup of joe isn’t just for waking up—it’s a strategic tool. Here’s how:  

* **Curb Cravings:** Caffeine temporarily mutes **ghrelin** (your hunger hormone), helping you skip the 10 AM muffin run. Try black coffee before breakfast to keep cravings at bay.  
* **Burn More Calories:** Studies show caffeine can rev up your metabolism by 3–11% for a few hours. Pair it with a morning walk or workout for a bigger calorie burn.  
* **Boost Workout Performance:** Feeling alert? You’ll likely push harder during exercise, which means more fat burned over time.  

**But Watch Out!** 

* A **coffee** loaded with syrup, sugar, or cream can clock 300+ calories—like drinking a slice of cake. Stick to black or lightly sweetened versions.  
* Too much caffeine (4+ cups) can backfire, leaving you jittery and craving sugary snacks later.  



**Why Evening Coffee is a Silent Sleep Killer**

That post-dinner latte might feel cozy, but here’s the truth:  

* **Caffeine’s Sneaky Half-Life:** It takes \~5 hours for half the caffeine to leave your system. Drink it at 6 PM, and 25% still lingers by midnight—enough to disrupt deep sleep. 
* **Sleep Loss = Hunger Gain:**: Even one night of poor sleep spikes ghrelin (hunger) and drops leptin (fullness), making you crave carbs and junk food the next day. 
*  **Long-Term Risks:** Chronic sleep loss slows metabolism, increases belly fat storage, and can lead to insulin resistance.  



**How Much Coffee Should You Drink?**

* **The Sweet Spot:** 3–4 cups daily (300–400 mg caffeine) for most adults. Exceeding this can trigger anxiety or digestive issues.  
* **Cut-Off Time:** Stop caffeine 6+ hours before bed. If you’re sensitive, avoid coffee after 2 PM.  



**4 Smart Ways to Drink Coffee (Without the Regrets)**

1.  **Black is Best:** Zero calories, no sugar crashes. Hate the bitterness? Add cinnamon or a splash of unsweetened almond milk.  
2.  **Cold Brew for Sensitive Stomachs:** Less acidic, smoother taste.  
3. **Ditch the Fancy Drinks :** Mochas and frappés are sugar bombs. opt for an Americano or espresso instead.  
4. **Swap Evening Coffee for Herbal Tea:** Try chamomile, peppermint, or golden milk (turmeric + oat milk) for a cozy, caffeine-free fix.  



**Key Takeaways to Remember**

*  **Morning Wins:** Drink coffee before noon to fuel your metabolism and focus.  
*  **Keep It Simple:** Skip the syrups—your waistline (and energy levels) will thank you.  
* **Respect Your Sleep:** No amount of coffee fixes chronic tiredness. Prioritize 7–9 hours of sleep.  
*  **Experiment:** Track your caffeine and sleep for a week. You might find ditching afternoon coffee stops midnight snack attacks.  

Coffee isn’t **good** or **bad**—it’s all about timing and moderation. Drink it early, keep it plain, and let your body thrive. Your future well-rested, healthier self will raise a mug to that!

Everyone's off in their own groups and keeping to themselves. Even in group activities I participate in, like sports leagues, it seems like everyone sticks to friends they signed up with, or just to themselves, apart from the occasional friendly conversation that doesn't really get you anywhere.

History of Asthma, high cholesterol (just diagnosed not on meds), currently taking Lamotrigine 400mg and Montelukast Sodium 10mg, Zyrtec 10mg. Liposomal Vitamin C (1000mg) B12 (1000mcg) and a Probiotic. 
No alcohol/nicotine or other drugs. Caffeine consumption is high, approx. 3 cups coffee daily. 

As of 4/12/25, I got comprehensive labs done. Kidney function, UA, CBC, liver, fasting glucose, and thyroid all came back normal (very good levels in fact across the board). 
I have a BP of 120/70. Pulse was 80.
By all accounts, aside from higher cholesterol (I have alot of LDL but total is elevated above 200) I'm relatively healthy.  
My K came back as a 6. 
No instances of this in my family. I did get a kidney stone back in 2017 when I was drinking energy drinks. I stopped after that. I don't drink alcohol, no nicotine, could be more active. 

For months I've had episodes of palpitations, breathlessness a brief gripping sensation in my chest. Never thought it could be potassium. I've always assumed it was difficult to get enough of it. My hubby has high BP so I've always cooked low sodium high potassium. 

My doc says to eliminate all sources of high K from my diet and increase hydration. I'm trying to eat below 1500 of K in diet. Should I go even lower? I was having a breakfast for months before my labs that apparently had 1300mg of potassium alone. Banana/oatmeal/nut butter/protein powder. That's gone for good. 
I want my levels down quick. 

I was taking alot of Magnesium Glycinate but dropped it from 400 to 240. 
My doc says she'll do labs again in 3 months!!! 
That seems like an awfully long time to not check. Especially when I do get cardiac symptoms that come and go. I asked her to do an ECG or EKG and she said that when she re-tests if it's still high I'll get a cardiologist referral. 
I'm ready to find a new doc or even head to the hospital. I have 4 kids (youngest is a baby) and don't need my ticker to stop. 
My hubby says I'm being a hypochondriac about it but I've got serious anxiety now.

The pay is more than the average retail or fast food but heck, even my convenience store jobs were more peaceful and relaxing than this. 

It seems everyone there wants to resolve any petty situation with HR. I've been there for a year and never had an issue with young employees. However, older employees have been horrible, I have been called old-looking, fat and ugly. It damaged my self esteem and I enrolled into fitness classes and I am getting skinnier. (I was just a bit chubby, not obese but almost every female worker here is super skinny)
I was told I look 50 by other workers in their 50s, even though I am late 20s.

Anyways I work for the morning buffet and people like the front desk guy or this other older lady coworker report everything about me, even how long I  used the restroom for. The other day I was like 10 mins late for my shift and the front desk guy was waiting at my workspace being nosy, like why I am late and coffee is not ready. Told him coffee is for guests and he is not my boss to ask me why I am late, does he has no work to do? This man has snitched on me multiple times and acts all nice around me and didn't expect it. Has made comments that I look old. He acted all mad and wouldn't even give me the sheet I need from him. He tried to get free food and I texted my boss about his behavior.

My boss just reported it to HR. He doesn't even give a damn to deal with any situation there, every situation I've seen, he just tells HR to deal with it. HR representative came in and she was asking witnesses and for email statements which the bully front desk guy found about and now he acts super mad around me. The HR representative is a girl in her early 20s who just loves gossip and drama. She loves getting statements for anything tiny.

On top of that, I was supposed to get a raise this month and they can't give it to me because the hotel makes no sales. ",3,1744982005.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

I'm very happy being on my feet all day except for short food/coffee stops and as an Aussie can tolerate heat. I'll get a day pass for the metro and think I will need a bus day pass too. Here's the plan so far:

* The Pearl - Qanat Quartier and Medina Centrale (2 hours incl. getting up there)
* Katara Cultural Village (1 hour)
* City Center Doha Mall and maybe West Bay Beach (2 hours)
* Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque and possibly Al Jazeera HQ (I know there's nothing to do there, I'm just a nerd) (2 hours)
* Msheireb and Souq Waqif (2 hours)

Aside from general advice I'd love opinions on a few things:

1. Is there anything to see/do in Lusail?
2. Is City Center Doha Mall a quick must-see (not really intending to do shopping) or better to skip it given other priorities?
3. Is it worth taking an hour out of the day to chill at West Bay Beach around lunch time? Seems like a nice vibe but if I need to cut out activities I think this and/or the mall will need to be skipped.
4. Are the Museum of Islamic Art or National Museum of Qatar must-do activities? Sadly don't think I'll have time for any museums but can reconsider a quick visit to one if they're really great.
5. Is planning to arrive back at the airport 2 hours before my flight sufficient to comfortably get through the airport and to my gate? I will not need to pick up/drop off any baggage. I'd like to explore the airport but can do that on my return trip when I have a 4-hour layover. ",1,1744982003.0,qatar,2,1.0,False

It’s been a weird couple of days so far. I had my bottom wisdom teeth extracted and an upper right molar extracted as well. Came out of surgery with no pain just discomfort. I’ve been staying on top of meds and has tremendously helped. I brush & rinse with warm water and salt 3 times a day. I had no swelling and no bruising. I mean honestly it’s been going very smooth. The only thing is I’m getting depressed. I like to heavy lift and drink caffeine often (almost daily). I will not go back to lifting until probably next week and I’ll probably start with light weights. My question is can I start getting on the treadmill for a little? Should I try some Pilates? Or is that too much? When can I have a carbonated drink again? Can I have an iced coffee now? Also, I’m don’t feel depressed just cause of that. Brain fog is so real after surgery. I’m not sure if it’s the medicine but I feel so out of it sometimes and get emotional.

Ever looked in the mirror and wished those little reminders of past breakouts, those acne scars, would fade away? You're not alone! The journey to clearer, more even-toned skin is a common one, and guess what? **Nature might hold the key to unlocking that radiant complexion you're after**.

[Discover Homemade Scrubs to Target Acne Scars](https://preview.redd.it/kyoqadykelve1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ffe9aee8c507c45dbaa7cea239ac5e032b03c78)

Those pesky dark spots and acne scars, often called hyperpigmentation, can be frustrating. They arise from various factors, even the aftermath of acne itself, disrupting your skin's natural harmony. But don't worry, there's a gentle and effective approach you can easily incorporate into your routine: **exfoliation**. Think of it as a way to gently nudge away the old, tired skin cells, revealing the fresh, more even skin hiding underneath. This process isn't just about fading scars; it also **stimulates that amazing collagen production**, which keeps your skin looking plump and healthy. Plus, it's like a deep clean for your pores, helping to prevent future breakouts and improve your skin's overall texture.

Now, here's where the exciting part comes in: **homemade face scrubs!** These offer a natural and accessible way to exfoliate, using nutrient-rich ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen. Imagine being able to create a self-care experience that not only feels good but also works to naturally lighten those dark spots, all without the harsh chemicals often found in store-bought products. The beauty of making your scrub is that **you're in complete control**, choosing exactly what goes onto your precious skin and avoiding potential irritants.

There are fantastic options to consider, each harnessing the unique power of natural ingredients. For instance, an **Oatmeal and Honey Scrub** can be incredibly soothing, gently exfoliating sensitive skin while offering antibacterial benefits. A **Turmeric and Yogurt Scrub** can leverage turmeric's skin-brightening properties and yogurt's ability to minimize dark spots. You could even try a **Sugar and Lemon Scrub**, where sugar provides exfoliation and lemon brings its natural brightening antioxidants. Other interesting combinations include coffee with nourishing coconut oil, the gentle almond with milk, or even a refreshing strawberry and yogurt blend.

Of course, with any skincare, safety comes first. It's always wise to do a **patch test** before applying any new scrub to your entire face. A little precaution can go a long way in ensuring your skin loves what you're giving it. Also, those with **sensitive skin, irritated skin, open cuts, or skin wounds** should be extra careful and might want to chat with a dermatologist before trying a new scrub.

Beyond just targeting scars, facial scrubs offer a whole range of benefits. They can leave your **skin feeling smoother and brighter** by shedding those dead skin cells. They can also **improve circulation**, giving your skin a lovely glow. By **unclogging pores**, they can even help reduce acne breakouts. And the best part? With the buildup of dead skin gone, your other skincare products might even absorb more effectively.

Using a face scrub effectively involves a few simple steps. Start by washing your face, then gently massage the scrub in circular motions for a short period. Letting it sit for a little while before rinsing can also enhance its benefits. Remember to always **follow up with a moisturizer** to keep your skin hydrated. Aiming to exfoliate **once or twice a week** is generally recommended.

So, are you intrigued by the potential of these natural solutions? Ready to explore the world of DIY face scrubs and discover how these simple, homemade remedies can help you on your journey to smoother, more radiant skin? There's a wealth of knowledge to explore, from various ingredient combinations to essential usage tips, all geared towards empowering you with a natural and effective approach to those frustrating acne scars. Why not take the first step and see what wonders these simple concoctions can do for you?

1k24jqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1k24jqz/feeling_heartbroken_after_seeing_my_dad_choose_my/,Feeling heartbroken after seeing my dad choose my cousin again,"Hi Reddit,

I (mid 20s, F) am struggling with something and really need an outside perspective.

Growing up, my dad and I were incredibly close. We shared a bond that felt unbreakable, and I truly believed he saw and loved me for who I was. But things began to change a few years ago when my cousin — let’s call her Amber — became more involved in his life.

Amber is the daughter of my uncle (my dad’s brother), and unlike me, she has both of her parents. I’ve only ever had my dad — he’s all I’ve had. So when our bond started to shift, it hit me harder than I can even put into words.

Amber is a lot younger than me, and when she became more present in the family, everything shifted. Her dad and several other family members started praising her constantly — about how beautiful, natural, and down-to-earth she was. That on its own wouldn’t have been a problem, but they began using those compliments to put me down.

I’ve always liked expressing myself through clothing and fashion — not to impress anyone, just because I enjoy it. But suddenly, my uncle (her dad) would say things like, “Well, you only get compliments because you’re superficial,” or “Amber doesn’t care what she looks like — that’s real beauty.” Every time someone said something nice about me, it was immediately followed by a reminder that Amber was somehow better. It was subtle, but it built up over time and left me feeling small, dismissed, and invisible in my own family.

And the worst part is that I was never unkind to her. I was a caring, polite child, and I even tried to build a relationship with her. But the more she became the focus, the more I felt pushed to the side. Eventually, I told my dad that I needed space — that I couldn’t keep trying to be part of something where I felt like I didn’t matter.

A few weeks ago, I reached out to my dad and told him I’d be open to getting a coffee with him if he ever came back to my country — just the two of us, no extended family. He said he appreciated that and would let me know. But then I found out that Amber and her brother are visiting him in the US right now (where he lives), and I can’t even describe how much that reopened the pain.

I know I was the one who took space. I know I said I didn’t want to be around the rest of the family. But deep down, I hoped he’d use that time to reflect and maybe try to rebuild something with me. Instead, it feels like he flew them out and confirmed that I’ve been replaced.

It hurts so much more because I don’t have a backup parent. He’s the only one I’ve had. And now it feels like even he has quietly chosen someone else to give that energy to — someone who already has both of her parents. I feel forgotten and discarded, and I don’t know what to do with all of that.

Part of me wants to message him and tell him how deeply this hurt me. Part of me wants to say, “If this is your way of telling me there’s no room for me in your life anymore, I’ll stop trying.” But another part wonders if I should just stay quiet and take what little I can get. 

Has anyone else had a parent emotionally replace them or fail to stand up for them when the rest of the family treated them unfairly? What helped you find peace?

Thank you for reading. I really needed to share this somewhere.


TL;DR:
I used to be very close with my dad, but over time my cousin Amber became the family’s favorite, and I started feeling compared, criticized, and pushed out — especially by my uncle and others. I took distance from the family but left the door open for my dad to reconnect with just me. Instead, I found out he flew Amber out to visit him without telling me, and it made me feel deeply hurt and replaced. I’m torn between telling him how much it hurt or just accepting that I may not be important to him anymore",3,1744981782.0,family,1,1.0,False
1k24j6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k24j6z/the_friend_i_thought_i_had_made_on_halloween/,The friend I thought I had made on Halloween,"This happened when I was 9 years old.

It was Halloween, and I was always the kind of kid who made friends easily, loved talking, and running with others until I ran out of breath.

That night, we were at the little square near my house. My friends went home early, but I decided to stay a little longer. I like that time of day, when the sky turns orange and everything seems calm before it gets dark.

I sat on the swing and stayed there, watching the sunset, thinking about the route I’d take later to get candy. I could hardly wait to wear my new costume and eat everything I saw.

That’s when I felt someone poking me.

It was a small boy, probably no older than seven. He smiled and asked if I could push him on the swing. I agreed, of course — at that age, I’d make friends with anyone.

His name was Otto.

He seemed like an ordinary child. Very cheerful and full of energy, just like kids can be. He was dressed as a pirate, but the costume looked old, a bit torn. I thought it was odd, but I didn’t mind. At that age, it didn’t matter.

We talked for a while. He told me about the pirate costume he was wearing, and I talked about mine, which I was going to put on later before heading out for candy. We even made a bet to see who could get more that Halloween. It was easy to make friends at that age. You would just say your names and suddenly you were best friends.

Time passed faster than I realized. Before I knew it, it was getting dark, and the orange sky had been replaced by a deep blue. I kept pushing Otto on the swing, and we laughed, trying to see if we could get enough momentum to fly.

That’s when a group of other kids showed up. They wanted to use the swing. They asked me to get off, but I told them Otto and I were still playing.

Their reaction was strange. They looked at me, confused, as if I had said something that didn’t make sense. I didn’t understand. Not at that moment.

But Otto asked me to stop. He jumped off the swing, smiled, and said we should go somewhere else.

“It’s getting dark,” he said.

I told him I needed to go home to put on my new costume. He seemed excited about that and said he wanted to see it.

I didn’t think much about it. As kids, we don’t think much. Things just happen, and we accept them.

We walked together toward my house. The streets were already full of kids running in every direction, wearing colorful costumes and plastic masks. The orange and purple lights flickered in the windows, and the sound of “trick or treat!” echoed from time to time, mixed with laughter and hurried footsteps.

Otto and I, who now seemed like friends of years, watched all of that with the excitement of knowing the best part of the night was still to come.

When we got to my house, I told him to start trick-or-treating at the neighboring houses while I took a shower and put on my costume. He smiled and said okay, waiting for me to go in before continuing.

As soon as I entered, the sweet, strong smell of caramel filled the house.

My mom always made caramel apples at this time of year.

She appeared in the kitchen, a dish towel thrown over her shoulder, her cheeks rosy from the heat.

“Oh, before I forget,” she said, pointing to the corner of the room, “I’ve set aside some old things to donate. Take a look later and see if you want anything.”

I nodded, more focused on the caramel apples, but before going to take a shower, I glanced at the cardboard box.

It was one of those big supermarket boxes, full of old toys, action figures with missing arms, scratched cars, and some clothes I didn’t even remember existed.

I shuffled through the top of the box, just to say I’d looked.

That’s when I saw it.

At the bottom of the box, half-hidden under a dinosaur mask, was the little gray cloth mouse.

It belonged to Polaco.

My cat.

He carried that toy everywhere, and I always ended up tripping over it in the house. It had been years since he’d disappeared.

My mom used to say that sometimes cats run away and never come back.

But I… liked to think he might show up one day, meowing at the door.

I held the mouse for a moment, remembering the way Polaco would curl up with it to sleep.

It wasn’t a sad memory. Just… a good one that came out of nowhere.

I put the toy aside, grabbed an apple from the bucket, and went upstairs to shower.

I lost track of time in the shower, only realized it when my mom yelled, asking if I had drowned in the bathroom.

In my room, I looked at myself in the mirror, and in my head, I heard the imaginary theme song of a hero transforming. I put on my ninja costume — one of those simple black ones with red details — and started posing in front of the mirror, thinking I looked amazing. As a kid, that was enough to feel invincible.

I called out to my mom that I wouldn’t be out too late and dashed out the door.

Otto was there.

On the same sidewalk as before.

With an empty bag.

I thought it was strange. I had told him to start without me. But there he was, as if he had never left. He smiled when he saw me, and I felt a slight unease that I couldn’t explain. Maybe it was just guilt for taking too long.

His pirate costume, which I had originally thought was just old and a little torn, now seemed kind of dirty. As if someone had dragged it through the dirt. There was a dark stain on the sleeve that I hadn’t noticed before. But I ended up ignoring it. I probably just hadn’t seen it before.

And then the night really began. We went door to door, running through the streets lit by Halloween lights. At each house, a new costume, a new candy, and a new chance to show off my ninja outfit. Otto, always by my side, smiling and having as much fun as I was.

Strangely, Otto didn’t interact when they were handing out candy. They would compliment my costume, make nice comments, and drop a handful of candy into my bag. This happened at almost every house.

But something felt off.

They didn’t seem to notice Otto.

And Otto didn’t seem to notice them. He just stepped back a little when they opened the door.

I thought it wasn’t right. They were ignoring my new friend. I figured it was because his costume was dirty and torn, but that’s no reason for exclusion.

But I didn’t let it bother me. We still had plenty of fun to have.

We knocked on a few more doors, and my bag was almost full.

The sky, once orange, was now tinged purple, and the wind was picking up, shaking the trees and scattering dry leaves across the sidewalks.

The house lights were gradually going out. One by one, the windows that had been lit up with Halloween decorations faded into darkness. The sound of kids running and shouting “trick or treat!” was growing distant, like a faint echo.

Otto kept smiling, as if nothing had changed.

When we passed by a square, I heard the sound of dry leaves scraping along the ground, blown by the wind. A nearby streetlight flickered twice before going out. A damp, earthy smell filled the air.

In a quiet corner, near a tree full of fake cobwebs and rubber bats hanging from it, Otto and I stopped. We sat on the sidewalk, the ground still warm from the day. We opened a few candy wrappers and sat there, talking.

I chewed on a caramel, and Otto spun a lollipop as we chatted.

“They’re annoying, right?” I said, pouting. “They pretend you don’t exist just because your costume’s torn. Stupid people.”

Otto looked at me with a crooked smile.

“Yeah… stupid people.”

I told him not to worry, and if anyone made him feel bad, I’d use my amazing ninja skills on them.

“You’d hit someone to protect me?”

I clearly said that in jest, but his response…

I felt he took it a little too seriously.

The way he asked, so calm and curious, made my skin crawl for a moment.

I just jokingly responded, “Of course, you’re my friend, I’d protect you.”

He smiled. And kept spinning his lollipop.

I found it strange that Otto wasn’t eating any of the candy, so I asked him about it. He simply replied that he didn’t like candy much.

That made my jaw drop. It never occurred to me that anyone wouldn’t like candy.

Otto laughed.

That’s when he stopped, suddenly. He lowered his head for a moment, and when he looked up, he spoke in a much lower voice, but loud enough for me to hear:

“I don’t want to go back home. I want to go with you.”

I stayed silent, not knowing what to say. It was just a friend’s request, right? Kids say that kind of thing all the time. But at that moment… it didn’t sound like that.

There was something strange about that sentence. The way he said it. As if ‘going home’ wasn’t about heading back after trick-or-treating, but something he desperately wanted to avoid.

I tried to make a joke:

""What, your mom won’t be mad if you disappear?""

He gave a sad smile — a smile I didn’t understand at the time. And he only replied:
“She doesn’t miss me.”

The way he said it… it sent a chill up my spine.

For a moment, I thought about asking what he meant by that, but he quickly changed the subject, offering me another piece of candy and saying we needed to hurry to get more.

Doing my best not to think about it, we kept walking through the neighborhood. The orange and purple lights blinked on the balconies, and the distant sound of kids yelling “trick or treat!” tried to keep the mood light.
But it wasn’t working.

And then we saw it. An accident.

A dog. Hit by a car.

There were people gathered around trying to help, but you could tell, just from looking from a distance, that it was too late. It wasn’t moving anymore.
I stopped. So did Otto.

The poor dog… probably had a long life ahead. The people crying around it… I imagined they must be its family. And for a moment, I tried to imagine what it would be like to lose someone like that. But I couldn’t.

I ended up remembering Palaco.

My experience with something like this was different. Palaco just vanished, but the dog… clearly dead, in front of its family.

When I looked to the side, Otto was motionless. Eyes locked on the dog’s body. He didn’t say a word. Didn’t blink. Didn’t even seem to breathe.

I called his name.
Once, twice, three times.
The sound of my own voice felt strange.
The third time, I shouted.
But he didn’t move.

I touched his shoulder. Cold. Stiff. I shook him. Nothing.

It was only when I grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away, that he stumbled and fell.
The fall was sharp, landing on his butt.
When he got up, his eyes looked normal again. He smiled, as if nothing had happened. But when I reached out to help him up, the sleeve of his costume slipped down. And I saw it.

A deep, purple mark. Like an old bruise, wide, covering almost his entire arm. It wasn’t bleeding. But it looked… wrong.

I asked Otto how he got that bruise.
He just said, “It was Mom. She says I’m too naughty.” I didn’t react — I wasn’t expecting that kind of answer.

Suddenly, his earlier comment made sense. Otto wanted to run away from home. And in me, he saw an opportunity for shelter. At least, that’s what I thought.

It was getting late. The discomfort mixed with the Halloween atmosphere gave me chills. I wanted to leave. But Otto wanted to keep walking. And something wouldn’t let me abandon him there.

I think we walked too far — I ended up getting lost, unsure how to get home.
And Otto… he noticed. And made an unusual suggestion:

“Want to come to my house? We can call your mom to pick you up. And I can show you something cool — you’ll like it.”

I thought it was weird, this sudden change.
One moment he didn’t want to go home — now he’s inviting me over. It was confusing, maybe because I was still following him around.

I refused. I didn’t think twice, just said I’d head home alone. Otto looked at me with that strange smile, almost like he already knew what I was going to say. I turned around and looked down the street behind me.

Complete darkness.
The street was empty, completely empty.
It didn’t make sense. It wasn’t that late. I took a step into the darkness, but something was pulling me back.

I stood there, feeling the heavy air. The sounds of the night seemed to have vanished. No more laughter, no distant footsteps. The only sound was my heart, pounding hard in my chest, the emptiness around me closing in.

I looked at Otto. He was still there, motionless, with that unshakeable smile.
A smile that made no sense. I tried to take a deep breath, but the feeling of unease only grew stronger. Something wasn’t right. Otto was my friend. So why was I so scared?

I looked down the street again.
But the darkness seemed to spread.
The shadows stretched out, creeping closer. And when I realized, there was no escape. I wasn’t alone. Not anymore.

With my chest tight, not knowing how, not knowing why, I heard myself mumble without control: “Okay, let’s go.” And when I looked back at Otto, he just motioned with his hand like he already knew.

I didn’t know what was happening, but something inside me instinctively told me I was going to regret this decision.

The walk to his house was short.
But each step felt heavier than the last.
And though the houses around were normal, something was wrong in the air.
A suffocating feeling — a place where no one should be.

Otto announced that his mom wasn’t home yet, probably working late.

Inside, the house looked… alive. Clean curtains, the smell of fresh coffee, an old photo above the fireplace. But the air was thick. As if the walls were watching.

“Come on, I want to show you my room,” Otto said, vanishing down the hallway.

Upstairs, I noticed Otto’s bedroom door was slightly open.

The hallway was silent, with the warm light from the lamp reflecting off the pale walls.
It was an ordinary, modern house, with colorful paintings and clean rugs.

I pushed the door gently.

The room looked like any boy’s. Made bed, neatly arranged toys, little string lights blinking on the wall. Toy cars, stuffed animals, a poster from some old cartoon.

But something felt off.

On top of the dresser, there was a small makeshift altar. Dolls neatly lined up, electric candles flickering, and in the center, a photo of Otto. He was smiling in the picture — but the eyes looked empty. Different.

Beneath the photo, a folded piece of paper.

I picked it up.

The handwriting was adult, steady, and the paper yellowed at the edges.
The message read:

“Forgive me. I created a monster. May God receive this poor soul and those he’s hurt.”

A chill ran down my spine again.

I looked around the room.

And there was Otto.

Sitting at the edge of the bed, his feet lightly swinging in the air, smiling. But it wasn’t the same smile from before. It had no joy. No lightness. It was empty. Tired.

“I died,”

he suddenly said, voice low, as if confessing a secret.

“She killed me.”

The room grew colder.

Otto lowered his head, his fingers playing with the edge of his costume.

“She said I was too naughty… too strange… that I did things no child should do.”

He lifted his eyes to me, and it sent a shiver through me.

“I know I said I didn’t want to go home… but I thought you might help me with something.”

He stood up, the carpet muffling his steps.

He stopped by the dresser, picked up the old photo, and looked at it.

“She did this to me,” he whispered.

“Said I was a monster. And killed me. She had no right.”

He turned again.

“I just need you to do one thing, just one,” his voice almost sweet, but there was something rotten behind it.

“Finish her. For me.”

The words hung in the air, heavier than any silence.

“After that… I’ll leave. After that, I’ll be free… and happy.”

The room lights flickered.

I wanted to say no, wanted to run, but my body felt glued to the floor.

The doorknob creaked downstairs.

It was Otto’s mother.

Her voice sounded light, almost humming something. I could hear the jingle of keys being dropped on the table.

Upstairs, in the room, Otto stared straight at me.

“She’s here.”

His words poured into my head like poison.
Telling me I didn’t have to run. That I could fix it right there.
That all I had to do was go down and end it.

I tried to refuse. Whispered a near-silent “no” just for myself.

And for the first time, Otto stopped smiling.

The sound of coffee brewing.

My sweaty hands, heart pounding in my chest.

“You know she deserves it.”
He took a step toward me.

“She needs to pay.”

I closed my eyes. Felt an icy chill on my neck, something crawling up my spine.
Like a weight — another presence taking up too much space in that room.

And then, I lost control.

My fingers clenched without my will.
My muscles moved as if they weren’t mine.

I opened my eyes and saw Otto too close.
Not in front of me.
Inside.

I tried to fight, to order my body to stop — but it was useless. Each step toward the door, each movement, wasn’t mine anymore.

He waited for her to head to her room — then act.
Down the stairs.
Into the kitchen.
And grab the knife from the sink.

In the window’s reflection, I could see my own face. But it wasn’t my gaze anymore.

It was his.
Otto’s.

And then, going back upstairs, the floor creaking under my feet. I heard her voice, laughing softly at some joke. Unaware that the past had climbed those stairs.

The creak of the last step sounded louder than anything in the world.
Every step my feet took thudded in my ears, but I couldn’t stop.

The hallway felt longer than before. Darker too. With each step, the walls closed in, choking the air around me.

The knife was firm in my hand — or his, I no longer knew.

Otto walked with me. Inside me. Like a weight stuck to my skin, breathing through my lungs, sitting in my chest.

When her door appeared ahead, slightly open, the sound of the TV muffled everything else. Some random movie playing, with happy voices that didn’t belong there.

“Now,” Otto whispered, and it was like my head filled with wet echoes.

The doorknob felt colder than normal.
I approached, the knife’s tip reflecting the TV’s weak light.

I could see her.
Lying on the bed, watching TV.

I wanted to scream, say something, anything — but my mouth wouldn’t obey.
Neither my legs, nor my hands.

“She’ll sleep in peace. Unlike me.”
Otto’s words came with a weight in my chest, like the air vanished.

My hand lifted.
The sound of metal cutting the air.

She turned her face, confused, like she’d heard something.
Our eyes met.

And in that second, before the blow, I saw everything she kept hidden.
The fear. The guilt. 
The past returning.

But it was too late.

I saw everything clearly. Each stab my hand — now his — made with the knife. Her desperate screams echoed through the house. Her expression… I saw it all.

I was forced to watch, as if my eyes were glued to a TV screen, unable to look away.

I knew Otto wanted to see.

But deep down, he wanted me to see too.

His revenge. His bloody revenge.

The world went black before I saw the rest. 

Only the sound of a whisper against my ear:

“Thank you.”

And silence.

It’s been a while since that night. 

Sometimes, I feel like I’ve been someone else ever since. As if something… stayed behind in that house. Or inside me.

My mother never knew what happened.
Never understood why I came home like that.
Without saying a word.
Without meeting her eyes.

Otto never showed up again.
No voice.
No shadow.
No reflection in the mirror.

But every Halloween night…

…I feel it.

A discomfort.

Like something, or someone, sliding cold hands over my shoulders.

And even if I tell myself it’s nothing — just the wind — Otto’s smile never leaves my mind.

1k24hv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1k24hv4/navigating_language_sacredness_and_creative/,"Navigating Language, Sacredness, and Creative Freedom: A Conversation for Content Creators","So here’s the thing about language: it matters. Not just in the ways we usually think of it mattering, like helping us order coffee or explain the rules of pickleball, but in the deep, connective tissue kind of way that lets us share a world with each other. And part of what makes the world complicated and beautiful is that we don’t all share the same associations with words. Take, for example, the casual use of names like “God” or “Jesus” in exclamations—“Jesus, that was a bad idea.” For a lot of people, those names aren’t just words; they carry profound spiritual meaning. They’re part of the scaffolding of how some people make sense of their lives and the universe, and so using them casually can feel, to those people, like a betrayal of something sacred.

And then there’s the other side of it, which is that most of us are trying to balance our own feelings and beliefs with the feelings and beliefs of the people we care about. Like, maybe you have a family member who feels so strongly about not hearing those names used casually that they’ll literally leave the room if they hear it. And then you’re left thinking, “Do I watch this content I love, or do I avoid it because it’s not worth the family drama?” It’s a hard position to be in, and it’s not an uncommon one.

Which brings me to content creators: the people who make so much of the magic that keeps us watching videos and diving into stories that connect us. Here’s the thing—I have an enormous respect for the creative freedom of content creators. It’s your right, and honestly, your gift, to express yourself however you see fit. The individuality of your voice is part of what makes your work stand out and resonate with people. Nothing about this argument is meant to diminish or constrain that freedom. If anything, it’s offered in the spirit of collaboration and inclusivity.

That said, maybe avoiding casual use of certain names—just as a gesture of thoughtfulness—could be an easy change that makes your work accessible to even more people. Maybe it’s as simple as saying, “Wow, that was a bad idea,” instead of, “Jesus, that was a bad idea.” It’s a small adjustment that would never dilute the uniqueness of your voice. And here’s where the irony comes in: in making this argument, I’ve used the names “God” and “Jesus” myself, and for some viewers—particularly the family member I’ve mentioned—even this use might feel like crossing a line. It’s a strange paradox, making a plea to honor the sacred by using the very words whose reverence is being protected. From another perspective—say, that of an atheist—the frequent invocation of “God” or “Jesus” in casual conversation might even be seen as intrusive, bringing references to divinity into moments that have nothing to do with spirituality. For some, this reminder of religious context in non-religious settings feels unnecessary, as if forcing a conversation about God where none existed.

Ultimately, small shifts in language can have ripple effects you can’t even imagine, like allowing someone to enjoy your content fully without having to deal with the discomfort or tension of a family member leaving the room. And in a world as weird and hard and sometimes disconnected as ours, those small acts of consideration feel like a pretty lovely thing to do.",1,1744981628.0,nerdfighters,0,1.0,False

1k24gwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1k24gwn/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1k24fo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/1k24fo8/my_horror_strategy_game_anoxia_station_is_coming/,"My horror strategy game, Anoxia Station, is coming out on May 9! In an alternate Cold War, an international mining crew is sent collect resources in the depths the Earth. Enter a claustrophobic descent into insanity as you survive disasters, treachery and nightmarish creatures","Hi! I'm Yakov, and with my friend Daria, we're incredibly excited to finally announce the release date for Anoxia Station on May 9 (after years of eventful development, leaving my country, late nights, and a whole lot of coffee)!

Our turn-based horror & survival-inspired strategy features 4X and puzzle elements for the citybuilding / basebuilding mechanics. It also borrows and twists mechanics from simulation games to focus on survival, resource management, and tactical decisions where mistakes can be fatal.

Steam page link if you want to check out my game: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia\_Station/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/)

Anoxia Stations is my third project and draws inspiration from Alien, Dune, Frostpunk, and the Siberian gold rush depicted in ""Gloomy River"" by Vyacheslav Shishkov. This isn't just a milestone for artist Daria Vodyanaya and me; it's a culmination of our passion for crafting a unique horror strategy experience. We've poured our hearts into creating a world that's both terrifying and captivating, a place where the oppressive atmosphere of a decaying underground mine meets the unsettling dread of the unknown.

Set in an alternate Cold War in 1988 after a supervolcano eruption that scorched the surface of our planet, you lead international expeditions in the depths of the Earth. Humanity's future hangs by a thread. The leader you choose affects gameplay and secret objectives as you search for a massive oil deposit that could save humanity. Build and manage an underground station. Gather and maintain resources to keep your workers alive. Work against a harsh environment with extreme pressure, heat, radiation, and monstrous creatures. And make tough decisions while dealing with the mental state of your crew and potential traitors. Each injury or death permanently reduces your team. Your multinational crew includes specialists from the USSR, USA, East Germany, and Japan—all with their own agendas. As you dig deeper into the mines, the biggest threat might turn out to be your fellow crew member.

What to expect for the release:

* A Claustrophobic Nightmare: Prepare to manage a failing station, where every creak and flicker of light amplifies the tension.
* Strategic Survival: Resource management is key. You'll need to balance dwindling supplies, repair critical systems, and maintain your crew's sanity.
* A Dark, Unraveling Mystery: Explore the depths of Anoxia Station, piecing together cryptic messages and environmental clues to uncover the terrifying truth. Will you find the petroleum deposit that could mean the salvation of mankind?
* Horrors Beyond Comprehension: Face creatures that defy explanation, pushing you to the edge of sanity.
* Decisions That Matter: Your choices will shape the fate of the station and its crew. Find traitors, make difficult sacrifices, and survive extreme heat, radiation and the lack of oxygen.

Community's feedback has been invaluable throughout this journey. I've listened to your suggestions and incorporated them into the game whenever possible.

I was about ready to leave when I saw through the window my ex across the street. She lives in a big apartment building across the street. As soon as I saw her, my heart rate rose like a rocket. She came out of the building and appeared to be waiting for someone to pull up. I tried to keep my head down as if I was looking at my computer, but I couldn't help but to try to slyly look occasionally to see what was going on. Two of her female friends pulled up, which I guess is a bit of a relief. They must have been having a girls' night at her place. I would have been extra crushed had it been a guy who pulled up. 

I'm pretty sure she saw me in the coffee shop. I tried to act like I was dead focused on my computer screen, but the windows were clear, and she was standing directly across the street not far from the coffee shop. The weird thing is, we never officially dated/broke up. We had an intense fling last summer/fall and I reconnected with her in the winter but over time I sensed the vibe that it seemed like she wasn't interested in a relationship. We actually just got back from a 2-week trip to Japan a month ago where we acted as platonic friends. We never ""broke up"" after the trip but the communication basically fizzled out a few days after we got back and we haven't spoken since. I kind of feel bad, like I should have acted like I saw her from the coffee shop or something. Idk. Now this morning I'm feeling down after seeing her, she looked so beautiful yesterday and I really miss her.

we went with 1 carry on and 1 backpack each. which was perfect for 2 weeks. i cant imagine what a pain it would be to carry additional luggage with us (i also took a sling with my camera gear in it)  
  
i did lots of research before this trip but my only regret was not looking enough for restaurants and not booking attraction tickets earlier. i had to use third party apps and overpayed for some stuff.

we had 5 days in rome (technically 4), 3 in florence, 3 in tuscany area, and 3 in venice.

**Arrival:**

we landed in rome at 17:30 on april 2nd. and took a leonardo express train to termini train station which takes like 40 mins to get there. then walked 20 minutes to our hotel which was 10 minutes away from the colosseum.

we checked in to our hotel and went out to see the coloseum at night. and we had dinner at this pizza place near the colosseum called pizza forum, which was a bit of a tourist trap but the pizza was really good.

**Day 1:**  
woke up at 5 am and took the metro to trevi fountain to see it before the crowds (there was still a crowd but not too bad)  
walked a few minutes to see the building of Galerie Sciarra  
then we walked to the pantheon to see it from the outside (it opens at 9 am but we wanted to see it without the crowds and it was literally empty at around 6:45 am)  
  
we continued walking to piazza venezia which was sadly under construction, but the Victor Emmanuel monument was amazing and huge. it was closed when we got there so we just looked at it from the outside, and there is also a cool fountain to the right side of the monument.  


we went in to a nearby church called Santa Maria in Aracoeli Basilica which was beautiful on the inside like every single church we went into in rome.  
we exited the church and walked to the nearby Piazza del Campidoglio. which was nice but lots of scaffolding when we were there. we continued past the piazza to get an awesome view of the roman forum, then walked up a little hill to see the massive statue of constantine.

(this whole little walking tour tour about 2 and a half hours including stopping and taking photos)

we walked towards the colosseum which we had tickets for 10:30, so we sat around near the arch of constantine and waited.

we entered the colosseum (there is an entry right infront of the arch of constantine if you have pre ordered tickets) and used rick steeves free guide on it which was pretty good.

we exited the colosseum after an hour and a half and went straight to the roman forum. we used rick steeves again for an audio guide of the forum and palatine hill which was good. we were in the roman forum for like 3 hours but still didnt see everything. i loved it though it was one of my highlights in rome.

we finished the forum around 15:30 and went to a restaurant called Trattoria All'Aracoeli near piazza venezia which had really good pasta and decent prices.

then we walked to the pantheon around 16:45 (i preordered tickets for 17:00) and the crowds were massive outside the pantheon, almost shoulder to shoulder trying to get inside. but once inside it was beautiful and definetly a must go when in rome. we again used rick steeves audio guide. 

after the pantheon we got ice cream at a place called frigidarium which was really good. then we walked around and sat in piazza navona until sunset.

we took the metro back to colosseum and ate at a place called taverna romana which was nice. then after a long day we went back to the hotel around 21:00

**Day 2:**  
woke up around 6, took the subway to vatican city to see st peters basilica, we got there around 7:30 and there was a line to enter but it was only like 10 minutes. we entered the basilica (no tickets) and it was incredible, it was massive, and beautiful. and make sure you dont miss the pieta sculpture by michelangelo.  
we walked around for like an hour, (i wanted to climb the dome but i couldnt find the ticket booth to get tickets for it)  
we exited the basilica and saw the square which was also beautiful. then we had a rushed breakfast at some random cafe (espresso and a cornetto) then walked towards the vatican museums. i had a prebooked ticket for around 9-9:30. we entered the museum and it was amazing, i espeically loved the gallery of maps, the raphael rooms and of course the sistine chapel. but everything was incredible in this museum.

we exited the museum around 14:00. we walked on the castel santangelo bridge and ate at a place called La Fraschetta which had really good pasta and a good price. after eating we returned to castel santangelo and went down near the tiber and saw the supreme court building. and entered the castle around 17:00 (prebooked tickets) the castle was nice but the views of rome from the top were the highlight for me.  
after the castle we took a bus up to gianicolo hill for an amazing view of rome and sat there until the sunset.  
we took a bus down to trastevere and walked around for about an hour then we took the tram back to our hotel. and got ice cream at a place called fassi which was also really good.

**Day 3:**  
we woke up around 8 and took the metro to the spanish steps. we got there around 9 am and there was a bit of a crowd but not too bad. the fountain sadly was under renovation. we walked up the steps for a cool view then walked to a random cafe and got an espresso and a cornetto for breakfast.  
  
after eating we walked to piazza del popolo which was really cool but sadly under renovation so a big part of it was inaccessible. after wandering and looking at the piazza we walked up to a terrace at the entrance to villa borghese which had a great view of rome.

we entered villa borghese which was beautiful and definetly a highlight. espeically the Temple of Aesculapius. we walked around and relaxed and went to villa borghese for a guided tour at 11:45 (prebooked tickets, sadly none on the offical site so i booked on getyourguide and paid a lot of money for a tour) although the ticket was expensive the gallery was amazing and on par which the vatican museum imo. i really loved it. the ceilings, the sculptures and the guided tour gave some insight and history of the place which improved the experience.

after the borghese gallery, we took a bus back to the jewish ghetto area, Largo di Torre Argentina was nice and had cats in it. the marcello theatre was cool, and the nearby ruins and the turtle fountain, and the massive synagogue.   
we walked on the tiberna island to the trastevere area and walked around and ate lunch at a random restaurant. we just continued walking around and then we took a lime scooter to the Pyramid of Caius Cestius and to the garden of oranges nearby. we went to the knights of malta keyhole but the line to see it was massive so we didnt see it and instead we saw the sunset at the garden of oranges which had a great view of the city. after the sunset we went back to the hotel. my dad wasnt hungry so we didnt have dinner, we bought a few salads at a supermarket and ate that.  
  
at night i went out alone and took a lime bike and saw the pantheon and trevi fountain and the victor emmaunuele mounement and the colosseum lit up at night which was cool but lots of crowds. then i ate a pizza and had a spritz with a view of the colosseum.

**Day 4:**  
woke up around 7:30 and took the metro to aqueduct park. it was nice being away from centro storico and seeing residential areas in rome on the way to the park. and the park itself was massive and really nice. and was a highlight for me, walking through the ancient aqueducts. after being in the park for about an hour we walked back to the metro station (subagusta) and on the way we sat at this cafe and had an espresso and the worst pastry ive ever eaten (pastry with nutella). after that we stopped at a supermarket and bought some bread, cheese, and salami and premade salad.

we took the metro to a stop near the appian way and walked through a park to get to the actual via appia antica and walked on it for like 30 minutes before getting tired and taking a bus to circus maximus, where we had a mini picnic eating our cheese and salami sandwiches and premade salad. then going to a nearby geletaria and having ice cream. after that we walked to campo de fiori which was pretty underwhelming, just a market filled with tourist stands. then we walked to trastevere again (love that neighbourhood) and just walked, and got a takeaway pizza and took a bus back to giancolo hill to see the sunset one last time in rome. then took the bus and tram back to the hotel and ate ice cream at fassi again.

**Day 5:**  
Packed our stuff and checked out of hotel around 10. we walked 20 mins to termini train station. and stored our luggage in the station. we exited termini and had coffee and a cornetto at a place called Sfizio Pizzeria which was good. we then walked and entered  Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, which was beautiful. then picked up our luggage and took a italo train at 12:55 (prebooked on internet for like 20 euros each passenger on prima business). to firenze.

we got to firenze around 14:30 to 15:00 and walked 15 mins to our B&B. then we went to a nearby self service laundry place to wash our clothes. and while waiting we went to this wine bar called note de vino which had a view of basilica de santa croce which was cool, although expensive. (we had a glass of wine and a mini charcuterie board)

we picked up our clothes and went back to the B&B to fold and repack them.  
we then stopped at a supermarket and bought some snacks and beer and walked up to Piazzale Michelangelo to watch the sunset while snacking. it was nice but so crowded. after the sunset we got ice cream at a place called geletaria dei neri which was really good, espeically their passion fruit flavor. then we walked a few mins back to our B&B.

**Day 6:**  
we slept in and woke up at like 9 am. then we had breakfast at this cafe called Ditta Artigianale which was down the street from the place we were staying at. it was very good but a little pricey.

after breakfast we walked towards the duomo complex. and passed piazza signoria and the boar fountain statue thing. and piazza repubblica. then we got to the duomo complex around 12:30 and i climbed the duomo while my dad sat at a cafe. the climb wasnt very hard and the views at the top were amazing! and at the entrance to the duomo climbed i managed to see the inside of the cathedral itself and it wasnt very impressive, so we skipped waiting in a super long line to get into it.

after the climb, we stopped at a supermarket and bought premade sandwiches and salads and had a mini lunch infront of the accademia gallery while waiting for our entry time. (prebooked tickets for 16:00)  
we entered the accademia gallery and saw michelangelos unfinished sculptures which was cool and a lot of religious paintings and artworks which isnt really my thing but still beautiful, and of course the highlight was the statue of david which is bigger than i thought and amazing and a must go when in firenze.

after the gallery we walked to a restaurant called Il Latini (no reservation, we got there when it opened) and i had the best meal of the trip here. we ordered a Bistecca alla Fiorentina with a bottle of wine and a potato and a spinach side dish and it was amazing! definetly top 3 steaks ive had.

after that we went back to the hotel and stopped at geletaria dei neri again.

**Day 7:**  
woke up at like 6 and walked to the duomo complex to see it without the crowds and to take photos. then we went to vivoli when it opened to try some of the famous affogato and for a cup of coffee (very good) we then walked to the uffizi gallery and entered at 8:45 (preordered ticket) the gallery was awesome, espeically the birth of venus and primavera. and the beautiful hallways. 

after the gallery we walked around and tried lampredotto which was decent. not my favorite.  
we then walked to mercato centrale and got a coffee and ice cream there. then we walked to the leather school behind santa croce church and bought a wallet. its a little pricey (around 80 euro) but i think the quality is very high since its recommended in this sub.

we then got takeaway pizza at a place called pizza napoli, then walked back to the B&B and ate.

**Day 8:**  
woke up early, had breakfast at dita artiginale near B&B and walked to duomo complex, i climbed the giotto tower since i wanted to take photos of the duomo up close, and my dad went into the baptistery instead, he didnt like it since it was under construction.

We then walked to santa croce church which was beautiufl and had the graves of famous people, (Dante, michelangelo, Galileo).  
after the church we went to allantico vinaio and got a sandwich. which was massive and very very good. and only 5 euro.

we then walked to ponte vecchio and towards pitti palace and the boboli gardens.   
we went into the boboli gardens first, which was huge and beautiful and since we got there around 15:00, we kinda had to rush through. we spent around an hour and a half in the gardens and we probably didnt see half of it.

after the gardens we went into pitti palace which was beautiful outside and inside. but strangely was really empty. we went into the palatine gallery which was gorgues and reminded me of the borghese gallery. we saw the gallery of modern art, the palatine chapel and the museum of russian icons which was tiny.

we went back to the hotel after the palace and i wanted to go back to piazzale michelangelo but my dad didnt since it was a hard walk up. so i went alone and it was great! i stopped at geletaria dei neri and i went with my dad to this restaurant called natalino, (no reservation) and the food was very good but a little expensive. and small portions imo. after eating we had more ice cream at dei neri then went back to the B&B.

**Day 9:**  
woke up, packed our stuff and checked out of B&B, we walked to the train station and took a number 2 tram to the airport, where we rented a fiat 500 at avis for 3 days.

we drove from the airport to siena on the SR222 road which is the chianti road, it was very nice but there was a car accident when we got there so the road was closed off. so we had to make a detour and get to siena on a different road.  
we got to siena and parked at a free parking lot near the center. (we got very lucky, a car got out of the parking lot asoon as we got there) we walked like 15 mins to our hotel near the center and checked in.

we went to a random restaurant and got pasta sitting on a steep hill which was cool. then we walked to Piazza del Campo and relaxed there for a while. then we walked to piazza del duomo and entered the church (bought tickets on site) and the church was beautiful, one of the best ive seen, although the floors were covered.

then we stopped at a supermarket to get some snacks and sandwich ingridients. and wine, and went back to our hotel, there was a very beautiful view of the siena skyline with the church right next to the hotel. we then ate at a nearby pizza place, which was decent.

**Day 10:**  
we woke up early, checked out of the hotel and drove from siena to montepulciano, we parked at a free parking lot a few hundred meteres from the historic area of montepulciano. we put all our luggage in the trunk so the car looked empty. we walked through montepulciano for about 2 hours which was lovely, then returned to the car.

we drove from montepulciano to pienza, i got some cheese there and we walked around and had some salami and cheese sandwiches with wine overlooking the valley. then we walked around some more and got into the car and drove to the gladiator scene area of the valley. (you cant enter with a car, so we had to park the car on the side of the road next to the no entry for cars sign)

we walked a few minutes to the scene area and it was beautiful, the green hills and the valley and the gladiator road and the house up the road.

we walked back to the car and drove to san gimignano which is about an hour an a half from pienza. we got there and parked our car in parking lot 2 (there are 4 of them) which was closest to the historic center. we checked into our hotel around 18:00 and got ice cream at geletaria dondoli which was infront of the hotel and it was amazing and probably the best ice cream ive had. espeically the saffron flavor.

**Day 11:**  
woke up early and had a coffee at a nearby cafe, then went to geletaria dondoli when it opened (around 8 am) and we were the first customers of the day which was cool, then we got ice cream and got in the car and we drove to pisa. (around an hour and 20 minutes) pisa was cool, the church next to the tower was under some renovation so there was scaffolding and it rained. we took our pictures and saw the tower. then had some quick snacks for lunch (premade supermarket salad) then we drove back to san gimignano.

i went to geletaria dondoli again and got more ice cream. and then we got some takeaway pizza to eat at our hotel. we ate and i decided to go out and see san gimignano at night which was awesome. it was rainy and dark and there were no people. i felt like i was alone. it was very calming walking around there at night.

**Day 12:**  
woke up early and drove from san gimignano to firenze airport (hour and 20 minutes), we returned the car at the airpot then took a tram back to firenze train station. we got a coffee and waited for our train to venice (prebooked on italo website for cheap) the train was at 12:00 and late but we got to venice around 15:00, and walked to our hotel which took like 15 minutes.

after checking into our hotel (cannaregio area) we walked around and got chichetti and wine at vino vero which was very good. it was rainy but still beautiful. we saw rialto bridge, st marks square and accademia bridge then we took the water bus back to cannaregio area and ate at Ristorante Levante which was recommended to us by the hotel reception. it was good but a little pricey. i had a squid ink pasta which was really good! after eating we walked around some more to see venice at night then went back to hotel.

**Day 13:**  
went to st marks basilica in the morning without a reserved ticket. we got there at 9 and stood in line in pouring rain until 9:30 when it opened. i was completley soaked. we entered the basilica which was beautiful but it was hard to see the artwork on the ceiling since there were barely any lights and it was a cloudy rainy day. i used rick steeves audio again which was good. we saw the basilica, the pala doro, and went to the museum at the basilica and saw a top floor view of the basilica, the four horses and the nice view of st marks square and doges palace right before our exit you could start seeing the ceilings of the basilica glowing since the sun started coming out so we stayed some more to see them.

after the basilica we went to the doges palace (prebooked tickets for 9:00 - 18:00) we went in around 13:00 and it was a nice museum. not too much to say about it. i loved the huge hall with the massive painting.  
after the doges palace we just walked around aimlessely and the sun was out a little bit so it was very nice.  
in the evening we ate at a restaurant our hotel recommneded but i forgot the name of. it was seafood and it was good. after dinner we had ice cream at a random place and we went back to the hotel.

**Day 14:**  
we checked out of our hotel in the morning but left our luggage in the hotel. we took the water bus through the grand canal all the way to the biennale gardens. we started walking towards liberia aqua alta which was a cool book store right on a canal. then we had some chichetti and spritz at a random place on a canal which was good. we got some ice cream at suso which was a little expensive but very good.  
we continued walking and relaxed at a random cafe. then we walked to the jewish ghetto area which was a few minutes away from the hotel. then we got some pasta at a nearby bar which was good and inexpensive. then we picked up our luggage and took the alilaguna to the airport at 19:00. then we got on our flight home at 22:00.



**General Thoughts:**  
this was my first time in europe and i loved it. my favorite city was rome since i love history but fiirenze and venice and the little villages in tuscany were amazing too. i wish it didnt rain in venice while we were there but atleast we had perfect weather in all the other areas we were at.

the crowds in florence and venice were very noticable. espeically in florence. it was packed.

we never encountered a pickpocket. we always kept our stuff next to us and i carried my passport in my camera sling and my dad had a money belt where he kept his passport.

we didnt study italian before coming and we were fine, we knew very basic words like grazie, bon giorno, ciao and it was enough together with english.",10,1744980946.0,ItalyTravel,4,1.0,False

In an alternate Cold War, manage a mining station and its international crew with conflicting agendas while digging for resources and surviving the depths' dangers","Hi! I'm Yakov, and with my friend Daria, we're incredibly excited to finally announce the release date for Anoxia Station on May 9 (after years of eventful development, leaving my country, late nights, and a whole lot of coffee)!

Our turn-based horror & survival-inspired strategy features 4X and puzzle elements for the citybuilding / basebuilding mechanics. It also borrows and twists mechanics from simulation games to focus on survival, resource management, and tactical decisions where mistakes can be fatal.

Steam page link if you want to check out my game: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia\_Station/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/)

Anoxia Stations is my third project and draws inspiration from Alien, Dune, Frostpunk, and the Siberian gold rush depicted in ""Gloomy River"" by Vyacheslav Shishkov. This isn't just a milestone for artist Daria Vodyanaya and me; it's a culmination of our passion for crafting a unique horror strategy experience. We've poured our hearts into creating a world that's both terrifying and captivating, a place where the oppressive atmosphere of a decaying underground mine meets the unsettling dread of the unknown.

Set in an alternate Cold War in 1988 after a supervolcano eruption that scorched the surface of our planet, you lead international expeditions in the depths of the Earth. Humanity's future hangs by a thread. The leader you choose affects gameplay and secret objectives as you search for a massive oil deposit that could save humanity. Build and manage an underground station. Gather and maintain resources to keep your workers alive. Work against a harsh environment with extreme pressure, heat, radiation, and monstrous creatures. And make tough decisions while dealing with the mental state of your crew and potential traitors. Each injury or death permanently reduces your team. Your multinational crew includes specialists from the USSR, USA, East Germany, and Japan—all with their own agendas. As you dig deeper into the mines, the biggest threat might turn out to be your fellow crew member.

What to expect for the release:

* A Claustrophobic Nightmare: Prepare to manage a failing station, where every creak and flicker of light amplifies the tension.
* Strategic Survival: Resource management is key. You'll need to balance dwindling supplies, repair critical systems, and maintain your crew's sanity.
* A Dark, Unraveling Mystery: Explore the depths of Anoxia Station, piecing together cryptic messages and environmental clues to uncover the terrifying truth. Will you find the petroleum deposit that could mean the salvation of mankind?
* Horrors Beyond Comprehension: Face creatures that defy explanation, pushing you to the edge of sanity.
* Decisions That Matter: Your choices will shape the fate of the station and its crew. Find traitors, make difficult sacrifices, and survive extreme heat, radiation and the lack of oxygen.

In the lead-up to this announcement, I've been focusing on:

* Final Polish: Ensuring a smooth and immersive experience from start to finish.
* Optimization: Maximizing performance so you can focus on the terror, not technical hiccups.
* Balancing: Fine-tuning the difficulty to provide a challenging but rewarding experience. Be aware Anoxia Station won’t be an easy game.
* Sound Design: Creating an audio landscape that amplifies the atmosphere and dread.

Community's feedback has been invaluable throughout this journey. I've listened to your suggestions and incorporated them into the game whenever possible.

1k246fg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k246fg,"Swedish Wet Pack Menu 33, best before May2024","What a great ration folks! There was one component that was not ideal in my opinion, which was disappointing given how great the rest really was.

This one was a Christmas gift from my parents last year!

I think Swedish rations are often overlooked and underrated due to limited visibility and availability, but I strongly encourage you to find one if you can and experience it. Great mains, most of the time, and a plethora of drinks and snacks.

Pics 1-5 show the contents. These rations contain 3600+ kcal, so there is a lot in there. And what is in there is pretty diverse and mixed well between liquids/solids, textures, and sweets/savory.

Pic 6 is the muesli. It was great. Reconstituted with water and was very creamy. A testament to the milk powder content.

Pic 7 is the star of the show. This pasta bolengnase may have been the best ration main I have ever had. Added crushed red pepper for a little kick. It is hard to articulate just how good this actually was. If I had this at a restaurant,  that would be just fine. Perfect pasta texture, meaty, savory, tomatoey, etc. 

Not pictured here is the last main, the Chicken Curry with Rice. I thought I took a pic, but must have failed. It's no loss though as this component was awful. Very bad texture and the flavor was not great either. I ate half of it, barely, for a meal and let my kids try it too. They did not like or want it. I'm ashamed to say it, but this was a very rare instance where I could not imagine eating the 2nd half of this dish, so it was discarded. Just thinking about it now is starting to turn my stomach, it was that bad. I do not believe it was rancid in any way either, just not for me.

Pics 8 and 9 are standard beef jerky and the chocolate which was bloomed a fair bit. This surprised me and must have occurred during shipping or something because it was stored very well in my care. Chocolate still tasted great though!

Pic 10 is a pineapple date bar. Great texture and flavor. A neat, unique, little component!

Pic 11 is some chocolate chip cookies. Again, a taste of home. Nice and crunchy, great flavor, no issues.

Pic 12 are these little fruit cube things. These were a great little pick-me-up too with a great chew and they do have different flavors for sure.

Pic 13 is the Salty Cashew bar with the nut cream on top. A great combo. Sweet. Good bite. Smooth and creamy Nutella like cream. You can find that stuff in a few different rations, like Swedish and Norwegian.  

Pic 14 shows 1/2 the sunflower seeds, yeah, they give you a lot of salted and roasted sunflower seeds, and one of 2 Bim Bom candies you get! These candies, in my opinion, are the best hard candies in any ration I have ever had. The Polish candies are great, but I think these are even better. Thank goodness the seeds are roasted and salted,  as some rations (cough cough, British) seem to think folks enjoy raw, unsalted nuts.

Pic 15 shows the strawberry whey protein. This was pretty good actually, creamy, sweet, and strawberry flavored for sure. A bit of chemical taste, but nothing too off-putting. 

Not pictured were the cheese biscuits; they were adequate for sure. Coffee was just fine too!

As you can see, a diverse array of snacks and mains; highly recommend trying one of these. There are so many menus it's tough to decide which to get. I have also heard the vegetarian menus are veey good too. I have a menu 30 (I think) on the way.

There’s a straight coworker of mine who’s significantly older than me (about 28 years). Over the years, we’ve developed a bond that’s always felt a little different. It’s close, warm, often flirty, and definitely not your average workplace friendship. He gave me a nickname early on that stuck, and there’s always been this underlying current of something more between us.

We’ve shared a lot of moments that felt emotionally charged— he would text me randomly asking about my evening or other things, we get each other coffee, touch each other on the shoulder, significant looks. 
Then one night, after a few drinks, we ended up spending the night together intimately. It wasn’t planned—it just happened. When we saw each other afterward, he asked if I had a story if anyone saw us go to the hotel room together, and told me he didn’t want to discuss it ever. 

I assumed that would be the point where he’d start pulling away. That he’d back off, avoid me, create some distance. But that never happened. If anything, he stayed just as present—still messaging, still seeking out my company, still holding onto the same closeness we had before. The tension between us hasn’t gone away; in some ways, it’s even stronger now.

We get each other coffee, he’ll touch me on the shoulder sometimes, and I’ll sometimes do the same. He calls me by a nickname. We hug on nights out after drinks.
One example that really stuck with me: after full year after that night, he sent a “Happy New Year” message to our work group chat—then a few minutes later sent me a separate message saying, “Happy New Year (nickname) x.” 
It’s gestures like that, that I read into, subtle and deliberate and I question where he stands with all this. 

He’s married and yes I know everything about this is wrong, I don’t need scalding.
There is a slight glimmer of hope he could be closeted and maybe he could be looking for a way out, but realistically I’m not expecting anything from him. But I can’t shake the feeling that he’s emotionally conflicted—engaged one moment, distant the next, but never fully letting go. And because he refuses to talk about what happened between us, I’m left doing all the overthinking on my own.

Does he regret what happened, or is he just afraid to acknowledge it?
Why would someone keep this closeness going if they don’t want anything more?
And how do I untangle myself emotionally when there’s no closure and he’s still so present in my day-to-day?

Hi all,  
I recently moved to a new country and matched with someone on a dating app. Our first date was really nice—just a casual coffee meet-up with good conversation. We followed it up with a second date at a park.

It was a sunny day, and he offered to grab some food. I only asked for water, even though he got himself tea and snacks and kindly offered to share. I didn’t take anything—something that felt unusual for me. I wasn’t nervous exactly, because I actually felt comfortable around him. But for some reason, I just didn’t feel like eating.

Afterward, I felt a bit bad about that. Not long after, he sent me this message:

 ""Hey, it has been really nice getting to know you, but I’ve spent some time thinking. I thought I was ready to date again after my last relationship ended, but on reflection, I still haven’t processed my feelings from that, and it wouldn’t be fair to project that onto you. I hope you find what you are looking for, and really do hope you take the time to go and explore around.""

I thanked him for being honest and wished him well. That was the end of it.

But I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him. It’s not that we spent a lot of time together, but something about the connection stayed with me. I’ve been wondering if it would be weird or intrusive to message him again—not to ask for anything, but just to be open about how I’ve felt.

Thanks to the folks on this community I've tweaked my recipes, added a Hario Switch and started using the Coffee Chroniclers recipes primarily. I then added CAFEC filters (wow, that's totally different paper and flow than my standard Harios!) I added Third Wave Water packets and distilled water to my regiment as well. 

Now I've finally pulled the trigger on buying a 1Zpresso ZP6 grinder (from Cafune as someone on here recommended) and wanted to get folks take on how to break it in. It sounds like you can buy things like Urnex Grindz (or maybe that's ONLY for cleaning, and not seasoning?), add lower quality beans and just waste them (maybe make [a steak rub](https://www.tastingtable.com/1103555/coffee-rubbed-steak-recipe/)  I enjoy), or just wait and see how it improves over time? I haven't had a hand grinder since my little Hario jar grinder a decade ago.

Beyond seasoning, if I should do it at all, how do you set up a ZP6 got light roast beans? Should I update my filters from[ CAFEC Abaca Coffee Filter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076MCYZ9R?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1)  to something else?

1k243fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1k243fg/o_level_tips_from_a_master_procrastinator/,O level tips from a master procrastinator,"1) listen to asmr

Starting with the weirdest one but i SWEAR it helped me. Basically in prep for Chinese oral, i listened to asmr videos in chinese so i could passively expand my Chinese vocabulary without having to actually sit down and study. The channel i watched was this 

https://youtube.com/@bakeryslumber?si=pOi0eDFKz1VDczIP 

She does package unboxings and tells some stories along the way. There are other channels out there but that was my fav to listen to and she uses words that are actually useful in conversations. And i got a distinction for oral so i think it helped. 

Then fast forward to October i started listening to history asmr to memorise content in my sleep. These are the videos that i watched, but there are many others, just do a quick search on youtube. 

https://youtu.be/HvO4xvH7gwc?si=VLKABEnoXAR4M7_t

https://youtu.be/uHP5LndzY1Q?si=Wn17HnO28b1eVS93

https://youtu.be/newIsB4BPJ4?si=YtuI6esuyNMkx_11

2) read your notes out-loud and record it

The subjects i took were all very content heavy and i had so much to memorise so i used passive learning again. What i would do when studying my notes was to have my phone record me reading the notes then i would listen to the recordings in the bus or mrt or u could also listen to sleep if u want to. Yeah u have to sacrifice listening to ur fav songs while commuting but desperate times call for desperate measures and sacrifices have to be made…. But at least this method is super efficient cause ur also memorising while u read the notes.

3) study the answer keys 

Ok so now you basically agar agar know ur content, time to put it in use. Put those notes away because they served their purpose. Now focus on how to answer the questions. Just read the answer keys, refer to the questions THEN answer the questions (shuffle around the papers, ofc dont read the ans key of the paper ur about to do cause ur not helping yourself. Read the ans key of paper A then do paper B). This was you can somewhat know what to expect and wont feel too hopeless when attempting a paper. Most questions in Os are repetitive so this method is bound to help you with 20% of questions u see. However, some tys publishers answers aren’t the best so i recommend reading answers to other schools’ prelims papers. That way you can answer . There are plenty of papers and ans keys on https://grail.moe/ so just search yourself. This method is also the best for cramming last minute when you dont have time to read stacks of notes.

4) start a ypt group with your friends

Im a naturally competitive person and sometimes a little friendly competition is a push to help me. I would get fomo when i see all my friends studying on ypt and obviously i cant be the only slacker so i get motivated to study. And it would feel very nice to see my name at the number 1 spot in studying hours so thats a plus. Idk how much i studied before ypt but i definitely studied more after downloading it. It also has leaderboards so you can complete with other ppl in Singapore. If you have no friends then there are open groups where anyone can join and get motivated by strangers.


5) wake up early to study 

Ok this probably wont work for everyone but it worked for me. I dont like studying late at night because i get super tired and demotivated. So instead of pushing myself i would just go to sleep and get up early to study. This way i would feel the pressure setting in (cause it’s literally the day of the exam). For every single paper i would wake up at 4am, crack open a red bull, brew a coffee, make a cup of milo and eat breakfast while studying (food is fuel for the brain ofc). The caffeine was definitely not healthy but at least i was sleeping early… ok dont really condone this method so try at your own risk. But this way i would push through any burnout and get some last minute revision in before the paper. Also it helps wake u up so you wont feel sleepy and blur during the paper.

6) READ and listen

People always ask me how i maintained a A1 average for English through sec 4 and the answer is i always read. Read the news, read stories, read fanfics i dont care as long as you read. Really helps to improve your vocabulary and grammar. I would also watch these tiktoks to help with essay writing, especially the narrative/reflective essays.

https://www.tiktok.com/@english.reading4?_t=ZS-8vdUUAiEmyl&_r=1

Again with the listening, but i would also watch commentary videos on youtube. It helps a lot with learning about world issues for oral and essays. Most of these channels speak in proper english and expose you to insightful views on relevant topics while not being boring. I recommend these channels

That’s about all i have to share but if i have more tips i can update. Again what works for me might not work for you so take this post with a pinch of salt and try at your own discretion. Thanks for reading and lmk of any of these worked for you.

And in those early months we were under contract not to talk about it, or take pictures or remove anything from the set while the approval for the finance was sought. Consequently there are very few pictures of that time, and I certainly didn’t take any. It’s pretty standard practice for a commercial endeavour like that– It’s worse today– if you’re at Pinewood Studios and you take a picture of an Imperial Stormtrooper having a coffee during a break from Star Wars better not let anyone know you’ve taken it! So I’m sorry to say I have no memorabilia of any sort from the show. The fact that Down The Mine was reshot later is the best indicator of exactly how sub-standard the pilot actually turned out. If Bob Gauld-Galliers is right, and a serviceable print turns up at some point, it will be interesting to see where the failures are most noticeable.

Today, he texted me","My brother Joe had been crashing on my couch after his wife Amanda left him. Their son, Jonah, said the R-word at school. Turns out he learned it from a YouTuber Joe let him watch. Amanda had warned him before, asked him to screen stuff Jonah watched, but Joe always brushed it off. She’d had enough. She packed up and left.

Joe came to me, but he was still acting like it wasn’t a big deal. Still cracking jokes, still shrugging things off. I didn’t know how to talk to him anymore without losing it, so I wrote about it here. Just to let it out. He found the post and left that same night without saying much.

That was a few days ago.

This morning, I got a text from him. Just said, ""I’m at a diner. Can we talk?""

I didn’t know what to expect. I was nervous, to be honest. But I went.

He looked rough. Like he hadn’t slept. Hoodie, messy hair, red eyes. We sat down and didn’t say anything for a bit. Then he just said, “I read what you wrote. All of it. I hated you for it. But I think I needed it.”

That hit me. I told him I wasn’t trying to humiliate him. I just didn’t know how to say any of that out loud without it turning into a fight. I was angry, yeah, but mostly I was scared. Watching him lose everything and still act like it didn’t matter just broke something in me.

He told me he’s been thinking about all of it. That maybe he hides behind sarcasm and “it’s not a big deal” because he doesn’t know how to handle things when they are. He admitted that Amanda was right. That Jonah deserves better. That maybe this was the wake-up call he needed.

We cried. Quietly. At a diner booth, over cold coffee.

He’s not coming back to stay here. He found a room he can afford for now. He said he’s going to give Amanda space and look for a therapist. Said he wants to be the kind of dad Jonah can actually rely on. The kind Amanda doesn’t have to protect their son from.

We’re not suddenly fine. This didn’t fix everything. But it was something. And after the last few days, something feels like a hell of a lot.

After unexpectedly coming into some money my partner and I might be able to make the jump to a house in a ""nicer"" area than where we are currently. 

Our criteria is:
- Max 600k budget but 550 or 575 would be better.
- Within London zones as we commute everyday for work so season tickets outside of this are crazy expensive.
- Good transport links into Victoria/Clapham Junction (bonus points for London Bridge too)
- A nice area, by this we mean suited to young families, with parks and coffee shops (bonus points if there's parkrun)
- House has to be 3 bedrooms (don't mind if 3rd is box room)

I’m 25 now, and I’ve worked as a security guard for the past six years. I’ve also been serving in the Defense Force as a reservist for about a year.

This year, I felt like I was finally ready. I truly believed I had what it takes to start the process of becoming a police officer.

But recently, I received a mobile phone camera fine. My phone was resting on my lap while driving, I wasn’t actively using it, but I know that doesn’t make it okay. It was around 1 a.m. after the gym, and I tend to hold things in my left hand when I drive, usually it’s a coffee cup, a battery pack, something small. This time, it was my phone. A stupid mistake, and I fully own that. As a result, I got a 3-month license suspension, and I’ll be getting my license back on July 1st.

Now I’m in a bit of a mental dilemma, should I still apply this year, or wait another year when this is further behind me? I plan to call the recruitment branch once my license is reinstated, but in the meantime I’d really appreciate some honest advice from anyone who’s been through the process or knows someone who has.

Is there still a chance I could be accepted, even with the recent suspension on my record? I’m trying to stay optimistic, but I won’t lie, it’s been stressing me out quite a bit.

Maybe you do too.,"It feels heavy when you realize that living life alone might be the safest choice. As you get older, the picture shifts. The dream of building a life with someone steady begins to fade, replaced by the understanding that it may never happen. And the realization does not arrive in chaos or heartbreak. It comes quietly, in a simple moment.

You are in the kitchen, holding a warm mug of tea. Dinner for one simmers on the stove. The room stays still. No voices. No laughter. Just the sound of the refrigerator humming and the spoon gently tapping the edge of the cup. 

That is when it settles in—this life, as it stands, belongs to you. Quiet. Unshared. Entirely yours.

You never made the decision to be alone. That decision slowly arrived after too many conversations filled with perfect words but empty action. It happened after long talks at 2 a.m., after shared playlists, after voice notes that made promises they never kept. One day the replies slowed. The energy shifted. You stared at your phone, wondering if you were asking for too much or simply too easy to forget.

You met people who were still carrying their past, still tied to people they claimed were out of their lives. Some stayed just long enough to disrupt your peace but never long enough to offer real presence. They held on to you loosely, refusing to let go, yet never offering anything firm to hold onto.

You live in a time where confusion is dressed up as love. Where emotional unavailability looks like strength. Where detachment feels more common than honesty. The truth is, choosing to remain single often feels like the only way to protect your peace and well-being.

You know what you bring. You know what lives in your heart. But sometimes it feels like you will never find a place to bring that love. The table remains empty, no matter how much you carry.

Eventually, you stopped asking. You stopped waiting. You stopped offering your heart to people who only ever showed up halfway.

Now, everything happens alone. You carry in the groceries. You cook your favorite meals. You take yourself out—to bookstores, cafés, and little parks with shaded benches. 

In the beginning, it stung. Seeing couples holding hands, laughing, sharing private jokes. But slowly, the silence started to feel calm. The quiet began to feel like peace.

It did not always feel peaceful. The bed once felt too wide. The silence once felt sharp. You missed the small things—someone checking in, remembering how you like your coffee, asking if you made it home safe. But with time, you stopped expecting it. You stopped checking your phone. You stopped offering pieces of yourself to people who never planned to stay.

Now, your phone stays quiet. The low battery alert feels more familiar than any “good morning” text. No one calls to ask about your day. And somehow, you have learned to be okay with that.

You light candles at dinner. You buy flowers for your kitchen table. You drive with your favorite music playing, windows down, no one in the passenger seat. You sleep soundly across the entire bed. There is no confusion. No disappointment. No need to beg for affection.

People say you are strong. They admire your independence. But they do not see the nights you cry into your pillow. They do not feel the weight you carry alone. They do not hear the quiet disappointment of getting through another day without anyone truly showing up.

Still, you keep going. You show up for yourself. Again and again.

Maybe healing looks like this. Soft. Steady. Silent. Maybe it means choosing yourself every day, even when no one else does.

And if real love finds you—present, honest, consistent—you might welcome it.

But if it never comes?

This life you built is still enough.

You are still enough.

And in this quiet space you created, alone no longer means empty. It means safe. It means home.",179,1744978890.0,LivingAlone,30,0.99,False

I appreciate any help you can give and the time youre taking to read this!

For anyone that wants the long story short : I’ve been on Hailey 1.5/30 for about 4 months (pack didnt come with inactive pills so I haven’t been getting a period). At the beginning of this month I started getting this brown coffee ground discharge (after taking the pill at various times for 3 days) & it has been ongoing for 16 days. Thought it was my lining shedding or breakthrough bleeding so I attempted ibuprofen at 600mg 2-3x a day for 2-3 days, but it has not gone away. I have an appointment with my gyno , but shes booked until June. Does anyone have any advice?

For about 2 years, I was using the depo shot as my form of contraception - It was honestly great not having a period, but I started noticing negative effects towards my mental health and motivation in general. Since I was no longer having sex and was ready to start this journey of understanding my body naturally, I missed my last appointment and started tracking my cycles.

What I didnt understand was because the depo had stopped my period for such a long time, as soon as the hormones had stopped coming in, I just started bleeding - it lasted for around 60 days. I had finally had enough, went to my GYNO, discussed it with her and ended up switching to the pill. 

I started these Hailey 1.5/30 tablets in January, but the pack from the pharmacy didnt come with the inactive pills , it was just the green ones, so I was back to never having my period. The pill is a combination of progestin & estrogen.

At the beginning of April, I started experiencing this dark brown almost black gritty discharge (to be fair I had started varying the times I would take the pill depending on what I was doing in my day, sometimes earlier than usual) & it has not gone away. 

Now, sometimes its brown spotting or a really stringy brown goop. Regardless, I’m forced to wear panty lines and pads throughout the day and it’s starting to frustrate me. I dont even want the guy I’m seeing to go down on me because it’s making me feel disgusting. 

At first I thought it was old blood just coming out, maybe my lining was shedding, but other women have only experienced that for a couple days - I’m going on over 2 weeks for this. 

I’ve tried taking ibuprofen at 600mg for 2-3 days & it did help, but I started experiencing negative side effects of taking so much of it every day and ended up stopping. The ibuprofen didnt completely take it away and it came back with a vengeance lol.

So, I’m just writing this to see if anyone has experienced the same thing, is experiencing the same thing, & if anyone has any advice for me.

I scheduled an appointment with my GYNO but its not until June since she’s really booked. So , I wanna see if there’s something I can do now.",1,1744978808.0,birthcontrol,5,1.0,False

It used to be binge drinking every weekends, then it turned to drink everyday after work, and then it turned to a 3-4 day lasting benders which make me feel like im dying after i wake up, shakes,sweating,unbalanced heartrate etc.. typical withdrawals symptoms.

This (bingedrink for few days-recover-then repeat again when i feel ok) type of cycle started to ruin all aspects of my life, i started to lie to my family, lie to my doctor just to get a day off report so i can fel human again and rest at home instead of going to work.

So, why i was drinking in the first place?  dont know.

 First reason might be / because i always felt depressed, everyone seemd they made it in life but not me, my closest friend is a pilot raising his baby, my other closest friend is going to camping trips with his girlfriend in his day offs from his engineering jobs, my other close friend is just lucky to be born in a rich family with 5 star hotel and does management there. and those friends i told you are close to me like brothers but never shared those feelings with them, i know that every single of them would come to fight with me if i call them that im in a bad situation.which is also interesting to me because i dont see what they ''see'' at me to give that much importance.

Second reason might be , they always told me that ill be a scienctist one day becasue i won nasa grade physics competitions in young age and also capable of making my own drones etc when the term'drone' wasnt even widely known in those days, funny thing is my physics grades were very low because i hated studying and looking on a paper for hours.

They also told me that ill be a successfull musician because i was able to play things in piano after i hear the music right away, but quit the piano lessons on my 3rd lesson because it made me bored.

Only time i was feeling in peace is in my dreams now, it might sound like bullsh\*t to you but sometimes im able to take control during my dreams and its a magical feeling, colours feel warmer, feeling like a child again.then i wake up to dullness again.

Last week i did 70 day sober first time then relapsed 4 days ago and that diazepam prescribed me just to cope for few days, doctor sait its only for few days untill you feel ok again.

But i noticed something, i abused it too, like i do with alcohol,  instead of 5mg morning-5mg night, i took 3 times a day 10mg each and i noticed something.

I felt like normal, i was joking, talkative with my coworkers ( my relationship was already good with them even i was the grumpiest person you can ever meet) thats also somthing weird but this time i was starting the conversations too.

I read that that benzo has side effects which makes you sleepy so i also drank lots of coffee, so my last 4 days were like  lots of coffee+30mg diazepam per day. and i was happy, i was feeling normal, calm, i did a project in the office in 4 days that would take a month generally.

I know the diaz box will end in few days.ı know i might have some mild withdrawals from it too but im used to it.

I tried going to gym too, hell the coach said i have extreme genetics that gain muscle and strength so fast, i was really fit and muscular for a time but the bad feelings didnt gone, then i thought, what am i gonna do with this, its not fixing anything, im just able to lift heavier now. and yeah a pinch of depression + beers and im fat now all gym progression gone.

My current mental state is , ill keep going to my 9to5 job till i get retired, then get old and die.

Thought of dieing one day is scary ofcourse but somehow it motivates me to keep going on, because i know that it wont last forever.

this sounds depressing right? i  thought the med my doc gave me would fix me but it didnt eighter (venlafaksin HCl).next time ill ask him to give me something stronger, something that will make me idiot like the patrick in spongebob.

What might be my problem? just wanted to share to see if any redditors had same experiences. Thanks.

ill probably delete those nonsense i wrote once the caffeine and benzos wear off, i know i will. its always like that.

For the past year I have been putting in fun facts about Rooks in the special request field of my morning online coffee order. The staff really enjoys it. However, I am running out of fun facts! Please help me with any facts you may have or even your own observations. I know Rooks are not the same as crows but any corvid facts will do and there isn’t a dedicated Rook subreddit.
