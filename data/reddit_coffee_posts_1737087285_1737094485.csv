In the parking lot of my examination center. I have this best of luck for your exams text from a friend opened in my phone, this thing I am writing was supposed to be a simple thankyou text but I need to jot this down. It feels strange. Everything around me feels like it's holding its breath. There’s an eerie calm wrapped around me, like I’m standing in a long queue to get an ice-cream. The sky is overcast, but the air is still, unnaturally so, like the moment before a wave crashes. The usual chaos in my mind is muffled as if every thought has been pushed just out of reach, hiding behind the grey clouds above. The calm is deceptive, like the silence of a hallway right before someone shuts the door, trapping the noise outside. But I can feel it. I don't know why the fuck am I writing these things instead of a simple thankyou but just to distract myself I started observing the parking lot, maybe it's the parking lot. I don't know what it is about this parking lot.The wind carries silent
conversations—unspoken pleas mixed with coffee-stained desperation. 
A kid standing two activa's away from me drops his pen. The clatter cuts through the silence, sharp as a needle breaking skin, I feel the shift. I don’t acknowledge it—it’s just there, pulling me deeper. The pen, tumbling, bouncing—takes me to a desk from years ago but for some reason it feels like it was three hours ago, a classroom bathed in fluorescent light. My own pen falling, slipping from my grip. I see it tumble in slow motion, bouncing off the edge of the desk as if mocking me, reminding me that some things you can’t hold on to. There’s a tremor in my chest, a familiar one, like the steady drip of time that refuses to stop, no matter how hard I want it to.
Back in the parking lot, the kid has already picked up his pen, gripping it like a lifeline. A car rumbles nearby. There’s a father sitting in his car, unaware that the engine is still humming. His hands rest on the steering wheel like he’s praying, though I know he isn’t. His child is somewhere inside, battling expectations as thick as the grey clouds hovering over me. The father’s face is blank, but his knuckles are white, gripping too tightly, as if he’s trying to steer a life that isn’t his to drive.
A gust of wind stirs the papers in the hands of girl standing across me, scattered across the ground, catching and curling like they’ve forgotten where they belong. The papers lift, and I’m with them, floating back to a different parking lot, another car. The night is heavy, and the boy in the driver’s seat is holding his breath, hands trembling against the wheel. He isn’t praying either—he’s waiting for something to happen, for the world to stop. But it won’t. His last attempt. The headlights from passing cars blur like distant dreams. He doesn’t move, doesn’t even blink. The test tomorrow is everything. Or maybe it’s nothing at all anymore. But in his silence, there’s no peace. Only the weight of failure that hangs in the air like a storm refusing to break.
The wind dies down, but it takes me somewhere else again. A girl is tapping her foot, a steady beat against the concrete. She’s gripping a page from her notebook, the ink smudged from where her fingers lingered too long, lost in thought. Her lips move silently, rehearsing the answers she knows she’ll forget the moment the clock starts ticking. She’s tense, her foot still tapping, as if it’s the only thing keeping her grounded. Each tap echoes like the pulse of panic she’s too scared to admit to. Around her, papers flutter and fall, but her focus is elsewhere—wait what? Why is she looking at me? Was I staring at her for too long?
 The kid dropped his pen again.
She was looking towards him, trying to escape her thoughts by observing others. This time, the clatter is louder, sharper, like a thread snapping under too much tension. I feel it, deep inside. It’s a reminder—a return to that moment in my past when the future slipped from my fingers and I couldn't do anything but to watch it tumble in slow motion, bouncing off the edge of the desk as if mocking me, reminding me that some things you can’t hold on to. The parking lot is empty, too still. The father, the girl, the restless tapping—they're gone. The papers on the ground, the tension in the air, all vanished. I check my watch and realize it’s been over an hour since I walked out of my examination hall. I’ve been sitting here, all alone.The parking lot is a vacuum now, just the hum of my own breathing. I’ve been here longer than I should, but what is ‘should’ anyway? The exam is over, and I missed it. Maybe the real test wasn’t in that room, with pens scratching paper—it’s here, in the in-between spaces where I think I am still in control. Maybe everything I am afraid of missing has already happened.",1,1737094322.0,CharteredAccountants,0,1.0,False

Sometime between 1998 and 2000, a Media Studies friend of mine showed me an image he'd been asked to look at in class. It was a PlayStation ad, super simple:

A birdseye view of a coffee tabletop with four coffee cup ring stains and a small PlayStation logo (I think) in the corner. Each of the four stains showed slight overlap/movement, as if to suggest four players had spent the entire afternoon drinking coffee--picking the mug up, drinking, putting it down again in almost the exact same spot--whilst glued to the spot and playing their favourite game together.

I've done multiple Google image searches, but nothing. 

I wonder if it was actually a provisional/unreleased ad, like an iteration of something that never made to publication and only into media studies textbooks(??).

Even so, I would have thought there'd be some record of it somewhere.

1i39zfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i39zfj/should_i_close_my_business_on_sundays/,Should I close my business on sundays?,"I am in a predicament.

Lately the topic of closing on Sunday has been sitting with me for many reasons. I run a drive thru cafe/breakfast/lunch  


1. It's keeping mainly me & also other employees from attending church regularly. It does not feel super good to have the non christian employees working as I'd like to set the example and encourage them to go to church/give them the oppurtunity to go. 

2. It's become a bit of a stressor. It's a hard shift to pull off. I know that a mandatory rest day would help us run the other 6 days a lot smoother and likely be very good for employee morale.

3. It gives the store a time for maintenance if needed/gives us a day if we ever want to host staff events. 

  
On the flip side

  
1. We are barely surviving financially. We just opened a 1 and 1/2 years ago. We are on the uptrend but it feels like we live deposit to deposit with minimal cushion. Closing 4 sundays a month will eat away that cushion and could be a real threat to us. God may bless this decision and make us busier / or not being open on Sunday will turn 80-100 customers to other businesses and we will not only lose sunday sales but potentially even other weekday sales if we lose the customer (this is the biggest dillemna IE: could it kill us due to customer loss) 

2. This is very uncommon for drive thru / fast food - CFA is really the only fast food chain to close and they inspire me. However lets be real, there really is nothing quite like CFA. Where as drive thru coffee has tons of competitors to steal business on sunday. 

Can you see the struggle? I could really use advice. I am scared if we close it could be the nail in the coffin. And to clarify I don't believe its a sin or wrong for us to be open. However I do think its better for us (in every way but financially) to close sunday.

I need to keep my possessions slim, so I think I want to only keep two, possibly three of these. I'd like to make a decision based in the following order of importance: sentiment, practicality, then selling the more valuable ones and keeping the lower value ones, unless value is not significant anyway. Some guesses on the ages and values would be helpful.

1. Nickel plated ""WAGNER"" SIDNEY O #6
2. Unbranded 9 INCH SKILLET Q (Is this a Wagner? There's a triangular flat at the base of the handle that's supposed to help identify this.)
3. ""WAGNER"" SIDNEY O #8  (This one ranks high for me only because it's big and can fit more in it.)
4. Unbranded 7 / 8 (Why two numbers here?) Comal/griddle. I think this is also a Wagner. I have no memories of this not permanently living on my mom's stove. And it's always been cracked. My mom went through three cooktops in 50+ years, but this old cracked comal always went right back to where it was. I can't even imagine how many thousands of tortillas have been heated on this thing. It has sentimental value, though my partner was given a brand new AB&I comal from AB&I.
5. Unbranded 6"" skillet. (I think this is the pan we always cooked eggs in as a kid. I have memories of cooking many eggs in a pan this size after dipping into the coffee can full of bacon grease that lived perpetually next to the stove. I seriously don't think I've ever made fried eggs as perfect in my nonstick pans as I remember making in this. It's small, so maybe I won't get as much grief for stockpiling too much. Too small for cornbread, which I only make about once every 8-10 years anyway.)

Start planning today and turn your backyard into a space in which you will love spending time.***

https://preview.redd.it/4i9aorn0whde1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d72508e58bd19cbfcac41b74f2d90919bfd4926

Outdoor spaces are part of your house but can become an area to relax with family and loved ones. Adding [**Outdoor Covered Patio Structures**](https://jupiterpergola.com/pergolas-for-shade) or backyard gazebos to a house can greatly transform the way its yard is used. Aside from beautification, it could also cater to other kinds of activities.

**Why Choose Outdoor Covered Patio Structures?**

The sun and rain cannot touch you in an outdoor-covered patio structure. This makes you use your patio all year long. You may be barbecuing, reading a book, or having your morning coffee, but you'll always feel comfortable with a covered patio. It also increases the value of a house. Most homeowners think that a covered patio improves their outdoor space's functionality.

**Benefits of A Luxury Backyard Gazebo**

A luxury gazebo would anchor your home's outdoor view. It can hold a party, create a secluded retreat, or serve as an outdoor dining setting, among other things. There are many styles and sizes to suit various tastes and budget preferences. They come in multiple choices, including wood, metal, and vinyl.

One of the homeowners who shared an experience with this structure said, ""We put up a stunning metal-framed gazebo with a robust roof. It has become an excellent spot for family dinner nights and weekend hangouts. The gazebo also gave our backyard a touch of elegance and neatness.

**Things to Keep in Mind**

When considering buying a covered patio or gazebo, consider how you would like to use it. Consider the size of your backyard and personal preferences. If you love hosting parties, a large gazebo or a spacious covered patio might be ideal. If you prefer a quiet and cozy spot, a smaller structure is the best choice. Covered Patio and [**Luxury Backyard Gazebo**](https://jupiterpergola.com/) are excellent investments. They make your backyard more useful and enjoyable

The choice of good-quality materials is also essential. A well-constructed building should stand for decades without constant repair. Check if your options can withstand the rain and sunshine in your region. Work with the most experienced people for installation. This way, you will be assured of safety and proper finishing.

**Easy Ways to Personalize Your Space**

For your covered patio or gazebo, you can add curtains, string lights, or a ceiling fan. These minor additions make the space more comfortable and attractive. Many homeowners also add outdoor furniture that matches the structure for a complete look.

For instance, one family hung fairy lights from the gazebo and set a comfortable chair on it. Other families set their patio covers and added dining tables and chairs below them to create an outdoor dining space.",1,1737093924.0,jupiterpergola,0,1.0,False

I don't remember all of the first half, but I was in someones living room and I was fighting with two adults, briefly mentioning, that there's something crawling up and down their walls on the outside. Because there was something black doing just that. It was a very civil fight, more of a heated discussion. 

Anyway, we then went outside and saw, that the thing crawling up and down the walls wad actually a big black poodle with kind eyes. It was tied to the fence and I took it's leash of, to help it. Then the actual owner came, but the poodle desperately wanted to stay with me. So, I took it home. The poodle just kept growing and growing, it must've been about 2m shoulder height, judging on how it looked beside me. Then I went to have coffee with friends and didn't tell the dog where I was going. It then proceeded to ransack the city, searching for me. We found each other and cuddled, but the major if the town wanted to have someone shoot my dog! In the end, we left the town and I was riding the dog like a horse.

Now, I know black poodles with red eyes as a sign of the devil. All around my home village, there are tales of black poodles as a sign of death. But this one had friendly eyes, sooo...?",1,1737093780.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

A friend tried to convince me that leftover men in the church aren't terrible, just awkward and need a chance. So I made the mistake of allowing her to set me up on a blind date with a church drone.

On the date, I found out his pastor apparently once told their congregation not to touch a woman, and he took it literally. So I asked if a woman were drowning, would he let her drown? He said yes, she must drown since he cannot touch her. He also doesn't like being seen with a woman because it'll lower her value in the eyes of society, but ironically, not his value. She'd apparently be labelled a loose woman for making polite conversation with a man, though according to his logic, she'd technically also be a loose lesbian if she talked to a woman. When asked about it, he couldn't think for himself and provided no answer.

Mind you, I've been to his church for over a decade before moving to another one nearer to home, so I definitely know that the pastor don't mean things literally, unless leadership there has gone downhill that quickly.

When the date ended, not only did he sulk over my RM5 coffee, but I found out that he looks at naked pictures of women, despite his claims of women's value, etc. I guess the pastor didn't explicitly tell him not to gawk at lewd photos of women.

Also found out that he had given out my number without my consent to his single brothers in Christ because of ""brotherly support"" and doing it as a good deed (after trying his chance first ofc and finding no second date), so I had a bunch of random weirdos sending me awkward greetings.

Needless to say that I blocked all of them, reported it to their church, and lectured my friend for her inability to pick. Never letting Christians set me up on a date again lol",5,1737093333.0,malaysians,1,0.86,False

When I love something, i wanna give it my all. It's so so so important to make people feel that when they come to a shelter, they'll have someone to talk to whenever, wherever about whatever. Think about it, how many time will a person living in a homelessness situation talk with someone who will welcome them unconditionally with all their flaws and numerous qualities?

To me, it's not just a job that I do. It's what needs to be done for social justice and equity. Everyone deserves to have their needs met. When I see homelessness, I see complexity, resilience, suffering, hope, ...

I also see my colleagues sitting for almost their whole shift watching tiktoks, knitting to sell it after, FaceTiming, watching netflix and doing the bareminimum of interactions with the people that we work with. Am i crazy or is that unacceptable?

Informal intervention is many things : Sitting in the living room with them and partaking in conversations, serving them coffee after a cold day outside, asking them about their day and objectives,...

Perhaps i'm an overachiever, perhaps i'm asking too much of others, but is that really all we can offer to the people that need human warmth and attention?

1i39npr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/1i39npr/kneecap_dislocates_the_wrong_way/,"Kneecap dislocates the ""wrong way""","I've been dealing with knee pain for going on 2 years now. 

I stood up in just the right way allowing the corner of the coffee table to clip just under my kneecap. 

It took 2 weeks of bracing and cane use before I did such a weirdly specific motion I felt my entire femur go CLACK, just right back in place. It did that a couple times over many months, but I thought ""oh well, just another EDS dislocation""

Last February it was getting to be unbearable, so I went to an Ortho who fitted me for a new brace and in her exact words ""well good new bad news... Good news you don't need surgery! Bad news you have EDS.. Which you already know about.. but people with your condition don't heal well from knee surgery so that's why I don't recommend it."" And off I went to PT for the umpteenth time in the past decade.

Went back for a follow-up and said to keep on doing me unless it's an emergency.

Went to a new doctor in a new state I moved to and tried his absolute hardest to make a fool of me. ""I bet it hurts if your blanket touches it in the right way"" oh yeah it does, my pants are the worst offender if they sit on it wrong ""oh and if the wind blows on it just right it about knocks you over too huh""

Told me to go to pain management and come back in 6 weeks for someone to assess my hip pain. I, of course, was a sobbing mess after that appointment  so they went ahead and set me up for the very next day with a different doctor.  This is the first Ortho who has ever taken my issue seriously at the get go.

He spent over an hour with me doing all sorts of maneuvers, and X-rays, and taking my full history, and walking me through each different surgery options before sending me for an MRI CT

Finally had the followup from images and he starts off with yeah I absolutely recommend surgery. This would be the whole process HOWEVER, your kneecap dislocates in the wrong direction 

Oh?? Isn't ANY direction the wrong direction?

""Well yes, but I've never in my career, or anyone else in the hospitals, seen a kneecap dislocate like that in that direction""

My whole femur twists itself now which is it's own separate issue, cause that means I undid the hip reconstruction I had 5 years ago. My kneecap doesn't sit in the groove right, but my good kneecap is actually further off track than my bad one?

They don't even make a brace to keep my cap from moving upwards and inwards. The lady who tried to give me a brace threw a whole fit because she refused to put a normal one on backwards, and was just as upset when the doctor asked to put the right knee brace on a left knee.

I left without a new brace cause he said any sort of brace thats not for this specific issue at this point is going to make it continue to get worse .

He has to consult the man who trained him. He has to get a whole team of kneecap specialists to figure out whats causing this mess.

The images? Shows signs of why it could dislocate laterally, but I'm special so it has to dislocate the wrong way. And I have EDS, so I'm just too lax for it to tear anyway. Because that would be way to simple to find on an MRI. Torn meniscus is the easiest repair he says, but they can't even fix that until they know how to fix my kneecap.

I asked how we might go about keeping the pain from immobilizing me when anything thinks about touching it, he said he needs to consult with specialists. 

I feel so much farther away from any sort of answer. I got a steroid and lidocaine injection (which I sobbed and gagged through the whole thing AND IM SO GOOD WITH NEEDLES TOO) which hasn't helped one bit yet. I don't feel like I'm going to dislocate atm, but my body still starts aggressively producing tears if I touch it at all.

I can't stand up or my knee kills me, I can't sit down or my hip kills me. I've lived with hip pain since I was 16, I don't even care at this point I can't walk through a grocery store without being terrified of collapsing. I can't even shower without the fear of twisting just the right way and breaking my knee and skull.

When it comes to thinking about my own identity, I've always considered myself a halfie. Some people argue that this is a problematic way to view your mixed race identity.  And I will not deny that there are certainly problematic aspects that underlie this label, as it assumes that you don't belong to either identity fully. But that's not something I can address in this rant without fully dedicating time and space to it. So, for another day. 

  
As you are probably wondering by now, one of my parents is white, and the other is Japanese. So truly a halfie, or *hafu*, in Japanese. It was what I was called growing up, and it made perfect sense to me too. Physically, I had a mix of both racial features; culturally, I enjoyed both backyard Memorial Day barbecues and Japanese New Year celebrations, MLB games and taiko performances. I felt equally connected to both sides, but also not fully - after all, there was a subconscious feeling that if I indulged in either one of the cultures more than the other, then the dominant culture would take over my life, leaving the other to wither in the shadows of the past. Hence, I was a ""halfie"". 

As I grew older, though, my proficiency in the English and Japanese languages became measures of my connectivity to both cultures. And growing up in America, English was bound to overtake Japanese. By the end of middle school, I was insecure for a number of reasons, but not feeling like I was ""Japanese"" enough was definitely high on the list. This too is an issue that I don't think I have much space to explore this time - the definition of ""belonging"" to a culture. Even now, as a young adult (which feels weird for me to say ngl), I find myself victim to these toxic whispers: that my eyes are shaped wrong, that my nose ruins the balance of my face. I've written about these experiences before in passing in a school setting, but looking back, I'm frankly horrified that past me was having such thoughts at such a young age. But ultimately, this meant that in high school, I was constantly grasping for a form of validation that my outer appearance and identity were acceptable. 

So when COVID-19 hit and my main source of entertainment was the Internet, I fell down the rabbit hole of #wasian on TikTok. If you were active then, then you know which specific audio I'm talking about. ""Wasian check\~""... just shudders. And I was obsessed. I'd scroll through that hashtag, coming across more and more videos of people who were similar to me. I'd especially relish when I came across an older half Japanese person - I felt even less alone then.

Eventually, I grew sick of it all. The stupid audio, the ""proof"" of Asian-ness with chopsticks and soy sauce packets, the poses that clearly indicated that they were fishing for compliments on their physical beauty. By this time too, I was making a more active effort to actually study Japanese and engage with my Japanese side, and so I think this really helped me to build a foundation in my identity without feeling like I needed this internet subcommunity to ""validate"" me by providing me with ""reflections"" of my identity. But as with any major trend on TikTok, it can leave a lasting impression on the viewers. 

Prior to COVID-19, I personally hadn't heard of the term wasian. Maybe this was prominent in other parts of the U.S., but for me, no.  Before, people would refer to me as Japanese and white, or Asian and white. Then after the whole trend, people began using wasian to describe my identity. And after my own experience with ""wasian check"", I had an image of what being wasian meant. 

Someone of mixed Asian and white heritage who prides themselves on their Asian culture without actually being connected, and in other words, making their identity their entire personality. There is a reason why there are those videos with ""POV: you have to remind everyone that you're wasian"" or ""challenge: wasian tries not to bring up the fact that they're wasian"" circulating the Internet. Because this was the annoying image that was being created from #wasiancheck. 

I am sure that people will disagree with me on this perspective, and maybe I am being really controversial and rude, but it doesn't change the fact that this is the unconscious image that I get when I hear the word ""wasian"". And so I was honestly quite insulted when people first started calling me wasian. 

""How dare they compare me to those shallow people who think being part Asian is a cute personality trait and not an actual part of their identity? Even though I struggled over feeling 'Japanese' enough for so long..."" I thought these kind of thoughts often during that time. Looking back, this was definitely very close-minded of me. I can't assume I know how someone views their identity, nor how they've struggled with their identity. But with the word ""wasian"", I felt that these people were taking away and undoing the progress that I had made in rediscovering my personal identity. And that hurt. 

Even now, I think I still have a tendency to be strict on people who I think fit my negative image of ""wasian"". In my first year of college, one of the girls I was assigned to live with was also half Japanese half white, and she was the only other one in our entire dorm building. She talked to everyone about how she was going to take Japanese as her foreign language requirement, as she didn't learn any growing up. I eagerly told her that I would love to help her with learning it, and I truly wanted to build a bond with her over this experience. Within the first week, she dropped the course and switched to a language that is infamous for being really easy at my college. And I didn't find out until over a month had passed. I was so offended by her disregard for her Japanese side that I wrote a fictional short story about it, because I didn't want to release my frustration by ranting and inevitably talking badly about her to other people. (She turned out to not be the nicest person anyway, but I do think now that it would be unfair for such an honestly trivial thing to create conflict.)

The writing really did help, and I was able to think about it more rationally as I took time to put my feelings into words, but I got the feeling that this is something I'll never be able to escape. The concept of the ""wasian"", whether it's spoken or not. Because now, I'll always try to make sure I don't fall into that ""wasian"" category. I won't talk about my Japanese side of the family. I won't choose boba or ramen, opting for coffee or pizza (but  I do think all of them are delicious!). But this still means I can't let my eye twitch when people refer to me as wasian. 

Essentially, I think my main issue with the term is that it feels like erasure. My experience as someone who is both Japanese and white (regardless of whether I consider myself halves or whole) is not the same as someone who is both Indian and white, or mixed Korean-Filipino-white. And yet we're grouped into the same, we're assumed to be the same bumbling trend-obsessed fools (in the nicest way possible) that TikTok portrays. Yes, you can say that the same applies to other racial labels like Asian, Latino/a, black. But I argue that wasian has the connotation that you're actually just a white person with some Asian blood and marketing it to show that you're unique. And that's the key difference. All of the other labels demonstrate an inherent connection to the respective culture; ""wasian"" is implying that you don't have a connection to your Asian culture at all. 

Again, you may disagree with me on my take. You may even think that I'm some twisted, horrible person for thinking this. But I do think that the birth of ""wasian"" has not really contributed to the growing question of multiracial identity in America; it's only diminished people's identities and associated struggles to a cute Internet concept for people to watch, make fun of, and ultimately pass off as entertainment.

My ex and I decided to not be together as it wasn't working, the breakup was somewhat amicable althought kind of awkward at the start as we have a small friend group in a small town.

Despite the things I was hurt about that happened in the relationship I decided and made effort to remain friends with him to make our lives and everyone else's easier. We have hung out for coffee etc since that and been amicable.

I recently found out he slept with one of my friends within the friend group about a month ago. They both decided to actively not tell me (I assume because they knew I would be upset) and from what I can gather they chose to do it again.. I found out through another friend in the group, and instantly felt stupid that everyone knew and I didn't, and thought about all the times I'd seen them and hung out with them since and didn't know and they didn't say anything. I mulled it over for a while as I didn't think reaching out to him would be a good decision, he never validated my feelings once in a our relationship so I don't imagine he would do it now.

Before we got together he also was secretly hooking up with one of his friends ex's so in a way I expected it from him and him not caring about my feelings but I feel really hurt by her...especially them doing it more than once. I've confided in her through our relationship and breakup, sat on her couch and cried about him to her and feel really betrayed by her even if we weren't super close.

The part of me that wants to leave it and not say anything is the part of me that has healed and moved on (still it's only been four months). The part of me that feels hurt and wants to address is is obviously old wounds being reopened and also probably my feisty side.

He reached out to me to hang out and I explained that I knew and I felt hurt about it being in friend group and I'd tried to remain friends with him but I don't feel like his actions showed he wanted to reciprocate that and his reply was ""kk, not sure what you want me to say"" and also said that he thought I was out of line. I told her I knew and how I was feeling around it too.

  It was a tranquil evening, the dense forest alive with the cheerful chirping of birds, and laughter echoing around the crackling campfire. Then, in an instant, a blinding flash pierced the night—and the world plunged into darkness. The forest fell eerily silent; no birdsong, no joyful chatter, just an oppressive, unnatural quiet. Even the crackling of the fire seemed distant and hollow, as if the forest itself had sensed the horror about to unfold. The laughter of moments ago twisted into gut-wrenching screams, and the air filled with the agonizing moans of the dying



   A distant voice called “…'Andreeew….Andreew… Andrew…' “



 Andrew woke up at the sound of Jennifer Saltzman’s voice—though everyone just called her Jen. She was standing at the foot of his cot, hands on her hips, amber eyes glinting with mischief. 'Rise and shine, sleeping beauty,' she said with a grin.

Jen was a quirky, skinny blonde who had a fondness for colorful clothes, and today was no different—her bright yellow jacket stood out like a beacon against the sterile white walls of the infirmary. She was around the same age as Andrew, 16 or 17, though not quite as tall. Despite her small stature, she had a way of filling the room with her energy. 

They went to Goode High School together

 ""'What's up, dufus?' Jen said playfully, nudging Andrew's shoulder.

'All fine, tadpole,' Andrew replied with a smirk.

They sat together in the waiting room, where the blue walls and the dim lighting created a calm, almost sterile atmosphere. The large windows overlooked the darkening sky outside, hinting the sounds of the evening new york traffic. It was a familiar routine—waiting for their respective parents' shifts to end so they could finally head home.

The agency, known as the 'Laminae,' was not a family business in the traditional sense, but a secretive organization of people who shared a common knowledge. Their parents were part of that group, though the nature of their work was hidden even from most of their own families. Few outside the agency's inner circle knew the truth about what they did- They had heard stories of gods roaming the Earth with their half-mortal offspring, of creatures of darkness so terrifying they could petrify you with a single glance, and of beings that lurked in the shadows between reality and myth and even cryptids.

It was understood that when they turned 18, they would have the choice to join the agency. But until then, they weren’t allowed past the waiting room, kept out of the workspace where their parents dealt with things that most people would never even dream of.

After sitting there and chatting for a while, the receptionist—a gray-haired woman named Molly sitting behind a sleek computer—called them out of the waiting room. Her voice carried the same calm efficiency that defined everything in the agency.

""Leaving early today, Mr. Anderson?"" Molly asked, glancing up from her monitor.

James Anderson stepped forward, his tall, broad frame and commanding presence filling the space effortlessly. He was in his mid-30s, his raven-black hair streaked with a few strands of white that only added to his air of authority. His hazel eyes carried a hint of warmth as they flicked toward Andrew. Though James wasn’t Andrew’s biological father, he had taken on the role wholeheartedly, raising him after the tragedy that had changed Andrew’s life forever.

James smiled as soon as he saw Andrew and Jen. Turning to Jen, he said, “Your mother left early. She’s waiting for us at The Cracked Pot, and we’re late.”

The Cracked Pot was a small coffee place just a few blocks from the agency. It was where they often went to hang out, indulge in cookies, and unwind. The café had an inviting atmosphere, a mix of soft chatter and the rhythmic clinking of coffee mugs. Aspiring writers could often be seen hunched over their laptops, while others simply came to relax after a long day.

They strolled the few blocks to the café, the evening air cool and pleasant. When they arrived, the place wasn’t too crowded—just the usual semi-full scene.

Claire, Jen’s mother, was seated in a cozy corner of the café. She was the spitting image of Jen, though a bit taller, and her cheeks were slightly flushed as if she’d just come from a particularly stressful meeting.

Andrew, Jen, and James greeted her in unison, “Hi !”

James took a seat beside her and asked, “What’s the matter? You look flushed.”

Claire shook her head and offered a weary smile. “Nothing, just a bad day.”

James leaned back, then added casually, “Do you know the agency seniors have decided to start a training course for new recruits next week?”

Andrew and Jen exchanged a look, clearly intrigued. The way James phrased it left no doubt—he was nudging them toward attending.

“Yes, we’ll go,” Jen said quickly, answering for both of them. “But what about school?”

James raised an eyebrow as Jen continued, “We still have that paper to submit for Mr. Blofis.”

Andrew nodded, silently grateful that Jen had brought it up. They both attended Goode High School, where balancing schoolwork 

“I talked to Paul about your school work. It’ll be taken care of,” James said.

James and Claire both knew Mr. Paul Blofis—an easygoing but sharp teacher at Goode High—who happened to be one of the rare outsiders aware of Claire and James’s work with the Laminae. His understanding nature didn’t make their assignments any less demanding, but it did offer a small relief when the agency's responsibilities got in the way of their schoolwork.

Andrew and Jen both nodded, though they were clearly expecting more information—maybe about what the training would entail or where it would take place.

James glanced at Claire, waiting for her to explain. When she didn’t, he sighed and began, “The camp will be in Alaska….”

“ALASKA?!” Jen screamed, her voice echoing through the café.

“Why so far?” Andrew asked, his curiosity piqued but tempered by disbelief.

James’s expression darkened slightly. “Alaska is the only place where you’ll learn more about our world than you ever could in a New York cubicle.”

Claire leaned forward, her voice calm but decisive. “The Alaska branch is perfect for this kind of training. The region has frequent supernatural activity, and it’s an ideal environment for you to gain real-world experience. It’s the best place to start understanding what we do.”

“What will they teach us there” asked jen curiosity in her eyes

James in a menacing tone said ""Your find out”

Sakshi, 31 F Bengali

Themes of the play: 
Cheating, Cuckold, Exhibitionism, Corruption, Breeding.(more..)

Title: A Mother’s Descent into Forbidden Desires - Son’s Friend/Bully

Act 1: The Ideal Family - The Picture of Perfection

Sakshi and Aakash were the quintessential couple, a perfect blend of tradition and modernity. Sakshi embodied the role of the sanskari Indian wife, always graceful, elegant, and effortlessly beautiful. She was also a devoted mother, having raised their son, Aryan, with the same values she lived by.

Life seemed perfect on the outside. But Sakshi was starting to feel the weight of monotony, the same routines, the same conversations, the same reserved intimacy with her husband. There was a part of her that longed for more, though she never dared to admit it.

Then came Aryan’s college years, and with them, a storm named Karan.

Act 2: Enter Karan - The Predator’s Obsession Begins

Karan was Aryan’s college friend; a cocky, confident young man with a devil-may-care attitude. He wasn’t just popular; he was the alpha in his circle. But he also had a darker side, a bully who got what he wanted, no matter the cost.

One day, during a college event where parents were invited, Karan finally met Sakshi in person. He had seen her photos on Aryan’s Instagram before, the occasional family picture, Sakshi in elegant sarees or trendy salwar suits. She looked hot in those pictures, sure. But seeing her in the flesh? She was stunning. Her curves, her glowing skin, her effortless charm, none of the young girls at college could hold a candle to her.

The moment Karan laid eyes on Sakshi, something awakened in him. He didn’t just want her. He needed her. And Karan was never one to back down from a challenge.

Act 3: The Games Begin - Flirting with Boundaries

Karan began showing up at Aryan’s house more frequently. Initially, it seemed innocent enough, just a friend hanging out. But Karan’s real motive was clear: he wanted to get closer to Sakshi.

Sakshi, ever the gracious host, welcomed him warmly. She was naturally easygoing and friendly, and Karan found it effortless to charm her. He’d throw in flirty, pervy comments disguised as jokes.

“You don’t look like a typical mom, Sakshi,” he’d say with a mischievous grin. “No wonder Aryan doesn’t post more pictures of you..he’s probably worried his friends will start crushing on you.”

Sakshi would laugh it off, thinking it was harmless banter. But deep down, she enjoyed the attention. It made her feel desired in a way she hadn’t felt in years.

Act 4: The First few “Dates”

The flirtation escalated when Karan suggested a coffee outing. “Come on, Sakshi. Just a quick coffee. Aryan doesn’t need to know.”

She hesitated but eventually agreed. After all, what harm could a coffee date do?

That one coffee turned into multiple “dates” They’d explore new cafés, watch movies together, and even take long walks. Each time, Karan pushed the boundaries a little further..holding her hand, brushing her hair away from her face, complimenting her in ways no one else dared.

“You’re wasted on Aakash,” he said one day, his voice low and teasing. “He doesn’t know what he has.”

Sakshi’s heart raced at his words. She tried to push the guilt aside, but Karan’s charm was overwhelming.

Act 5: The Birthday Party - The Night of No Return

When Karan invited Sakshi to his birthday party, she hesitated. But Aryan convinced her to go, saying it would be fun.

At the party, Karan treated Sakshi like his. He paraded her around, introducing her to his friends as if she were his date. And Sakshi didn’t mind. She liked the way he made her feel; desirable, sexy, alive.

As the night went on, Aryan left early, trusting Karan to drop his mom home.

The moment Aryan was gone, Karan’s demeanor changed. His playful charm turned into something darker, more dominant.

“You’re staying the night” he whispered, pressing her against the wall. “I’m done waiting!”

Sakshi tried to resist, but the passion between them ignited like wildfire. Karan didn’t hold back. He claimed her in every room of his apartment..the kitchen counter, the living room couch, even against the balcony railing. By the time they were done, Sakshi was a used, trembling mess, completely under Karan’s control.

The next morning, she slipped on one of Karan’s shirts to go home. Her dress lay torn on the floor. As she walked into her house, she was grateful that Aakash was at work and Aryan was still asleep.

Act 6: The Transformation - From Wife to Slut

After that night, everything changed.

Karan awakened something in Sakshi; a wild, slutty side she never knew she had. Their dates became more daring. They’d make out in public parks, sneak away to motels, and even have sex in Karan’s car.

Karan loved showing her off. He’d take her to parties, introducing her to his friends as “my girl.” And Sakshi played along, enjoying the thrill of being desired by a younger man.

“You’re my slut now” Karan whispered one night, his hand gripping her throat as he took her from behind. “Say it!”

“I’m your slut Karan!” Sakshi gasped, her voice filled with lust.

Act 7: Aryan’s Discovery - The Son Becomes an Accomplice

It wasn’t long before Aryan noticed the change in his mom. She seemed happier, more youthful. Her outfits became more daring. And Karan was always around.

One day, Aryan accidentally walked in on them..his mom being pounded by Karan on the living room couch!

Instead of being angry, Aryan was… intrigued.

“Mom, you look happier with him..” Aryan said later. “I’m not mad. If this is what you want, go for it.”

Aryan even helped cover for her, making excuses to Aakash and distracting him when needed.

Act 8: The Fall of Aakash - The Cuckolding Begins

As Sakshi and Karan’s affair intensified, Aakash remained oblivious. But Karan wanted more.

“He’s holding you back,” Karan said. “You don’t need him. You have me.”

Sakshi found herself agreeing. The love she once felt for Aakash was gone, replaced by her insatiable lust for Karan.

One night, Karan took it a step further. He convinced Sakshi to invite Aakash to one of their parties, a party where Karan’s friends all knew her as his woman.

Aakash, clueless as ever, watched in confusion as his wife danced provocatively with Karan, her body pressed against his. By the end of the night, Aakash realized the truth. ( We can build this differently and as we like)

Themes to Explore:
Corruption and Seduction: Karan’s relentless pursuit of Sakshi and her gradual descent into debauchery.

Public Humiliation: Karan showing off Sakshi as his prize in front of his friends.

Cuckolding: Aakash witnessing his wife’s transformation and being powerless to stop it.

Mother-Son Bond: Aryan supporting his mom’s newfound freedom, even encouraging her to live her best life.

Don’t send me a boring “Hi”. Rather send me your thoughts and ideas around the plot! Am a detailed multi-para player and am more into building a good story and developing good characters.

Gone are the days when candles were used to keep the things that go bump in the night at bay; nowadays, candles are often used to “set the mood” rather than serve as a primary source of light. At times, their gentle glow can soothe our weary souls and provide a source of warmth, while other times, their unsteady flickering can signal the sign of something more foreboding, like a looming shadow in the darkness.

Today’s drawings perfectly illustrate the duality of candles and the various ways they can add to an illustration’s atmosphere. Enjoy!

I’ve been dreaming about opening a bookstore, and I wanted to reach out to this community to hear your thoughts. I know DC is home to some incredible bookstores, and that’s part of why I’m so inspired to pursue this. But it also makes me wonder: is the city too oversaturated with bookstores already? Would a new one be welcomed, or would it just be another drop in the bucket?

I want to create a space that isn’t just about selling books but also about fostering a sense of community—whether that’s through author events, cozy reading nooks, or maybe even a coffee shop vibe.

A few questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Where should I consider building/setting up the store? Are there neighborhoods underserved by bookstores that would love a local spot?
	2.	What makes you choose one bookstore over another? Is it the selection, atmosphere, community vibe, or something else entirely?
	3.	What do you think about DC’s current bookstore scene? Are there gaps, or is it already well-covered?
	4.	The good, the bad, and the ugly – please don’t hold back. I want to hear everything, from potential pitfalls to creative ideas!

Ultimately, I want this to be a place the community embraces and feels connected to. So, if there’s something you’ve always wished a bookstore in DC offered, let me know!

Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts, DC. I’m ready to hear it all!

","  
I am a Christian and not a member of the LDS church, but I have heard online about something called a temple recommend. From my understanding, LDS people go through a meeting with their bishop to receive a ""temple recommend"" card to be allowed to the temple and thus this fulfills obligations to make it into the celestial kingdom. The bishop asks you things such as, have you been wearing your garments? Have you been paying your tithing? Have you drank any coffee? Have you been watching any pornpgraphy?

As a Christian , I believe that we all sin everyday, whether that be small things like white lies, holding a grudge, being envious, or more grievous sins. However, I believe that Jesus died for my sins and my belief in that will let me go into heaven. It confuses me how a bishop (not God) could deem someone ""unworthy"" based on the answers to those questions to go into the temple thus be not able to get the highest level of heaven? Even the LDS website says :""The only way to salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ"", how can that be true when the requirements to get to the celestial kingdom are to be deemed worthy by a bishop through a temple recommendation? I mean this question in all respect to your beliefs and just coming from a place of curiosity :)

Also, at the gym my max heart rate was 124.  

I was very uncomfortable going harder.

The pulmonary doctor put me through all kinds of tests and there was nothing lung related.

We tested the heart and noticed that the bottom portion was dark in the stress test x-ray.

Another test indicated that my RCA was fully occluded and the LAD was at 90%.

After the Cath lab they suggested CABG.  Open heart surgery.

They took a vein from my left leg and patched me up.

Was in the ICU for 5 days or so.

The nurses and staff were so kind to me.  It's the only time I got emotional tbh.  Receiving kindness from strangers.

At home I slept on a giant recliner that I highly recommend.  Especially if it's electric.  I'm a side sleeper and this chair enforced me to lay flat.  I used about 8 pillows to get comfy.

After a month I was allowed to drive.

a month later I started Cardiac rehab.  It's a big room with cardio machines.  I learned to strap on my EKG and get on the bike or treadmill and let it rip for about 1 hour.  There are fantastic professionals that took my blood pressure and monitored me heart on their monitors.

In the beginning, I could only do 2 METS on the machines.  By the time I was done I could max out at over 10 METS.  
I can do 7 METS for 1 hour straight no problems.  I just get sweaty and need a towel though.

My heart rate I've pushed to about 160.  But it's suppressed by the pills (metoprolol) that I take.

I completed the Rehab which was about 3 months.  The nurses and therapists there are amazing.  
I highly recommend the rehab.  I'm glad I did not skip it.

I go to the gym everyday and do 1 hour of cardio at 7 METS.  I can push it harder.  But I like my heart rate to be in zone 2 about 118 bpm.  

I still get emotional about those kind ppl at the hospital.  I've brought them sweets and coffee a couple of times.  I feel I should do more for them though.    
My sternum and the scar are a bit sensitive still.  I expect with time it will get better though.  
So many ppl have CABG!!

It's become such a routine operation and we're fortunate to have access to this type of surgery.

1i396rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1i396rn/feed_back_romance_drama/,Feed back: Romance Drama ,"West’s fingers tightened around his mug, the ceramic cool beneath his touch, grounding him as he tried to keep his expression neutral. Inside, however, a storm raged, that mirrored the storm  brewing outside. 
The café was warm, a refuge from the storm stirring outside. Golden light poured through the windows, refracted by the rivulets of rain sliding down the glass. The hum of conversation and the gentle clink of ceramic mugs filled the air, a stark contrast to the icy gusts rattling the door. But for West, the warmth of the café did little to thaw the cold knot in his chest.
His fingers tightened around his mug, the cool ceramic grounding him in the chaos of his thoughts. Steam curled upward, dissipating into the air, much like the resolve he had clung to when he first sat down to meet Lynx. He had told himself he could handle this—that it was fine to see them together—but now, sitting here alone, his patience was fraying.
West’s eyes flicked toward the door, the weight of anticipation coiling in his gut. The door swung open every so often, letting in damp gusts and strangers shaking off the rain. But not Lynx. Not yet.
The storm outside mirrored the one inside West—wild, unrelenting, a turmoil that refused to settle. He tried to focus on the warmth around him—the scent of freshly ground coffee, the soft laughter of a couple at the next table—but the sounds only deepened the ache he carried. The café felt like a bubble, a world removed from his reality, where people were happy and whole, untouched by the kind of longing that now consumed him.
When the door finally opened again, West’s breath caught. Lynx stepped inside, shaking the rain from his jacket, a familiar, radiant energy about him that always seemed to light up any space he entered. For a moment, West felt relief—a flicker of calm in his storm. But then his eyes fell on Tye, walking closely behind Lynx, and the flicker was extinguished.
They looked good together. Too good. Lynx’s laugh came easily as Tye said something West couldn’t hear. Lynx’s hand brushed Tye’s arm, a casual, thoughtless gesture that felt like a dagger twisting in West’s chest. The storm inside roared louder.
He hated himself for how much he noticed: the way Lynx’s hand lingered on Tye’s, his thumb grazing Tye’s knuckles in a gesture so intimate it left West’s throat dry. The way Tye’s gaze softened when Lynx leaned close to whisper something. It wasn’t just affection; it was understanding, a shared world West was locked out of. 
 He wanted to hate Tye, to blame him for the ache that had settled in his heart, but he couldn’t. Tye wasn’t the villain here; if anything, West had opened the door for him. He remembered the first time Lynx mentioned Tye, sitting together under the swing set, his face glowing with excitement. West had swallowed the flicker of pain that came with hearing Lynx’s words, convincing himself it was enough to see his best friend happy. But now, as he watched them together, he couldn’t ignore the truth he’d tried so hard to bury. This wasn’t selflessness—it was fear. Fear of what it meant to love Lynx in a way that no longer fit the boundaries of their friendship. Fear of losing the one person who had always been his steady ground. And now, that ground felt shakier than ever.
When Lynx broke away from Tye and made his way over, West’s pulse quickened. He didn’t know if it was excitement or dread. The sight of Lynx’s open arms and bright smile tugged at something fragile inside him.
“Westie!” Lynx called out, his voice cutting through the storm inside West like a burst of sunlight, warm and intoxicating, as if they were the only two people in the room. Lynx hugged him like he always did, like nothing had changed. But everything had changed, hadn’t it?
West froze for a beat, the weight of Lynx’s cheek against his shoulder both comforting and agonizing. His heart betrayed him, skipping in rhythm with the soft laughter that escaped Lynx’s lips. He wanted to hold onto this moment forever, yet he knew it would pass, leaving him colder than before.
“Hey,” West said, his voice barely audible over the pounding in his ears.
When Lynx slid into the seat beside him, West felt his space—and his carefully built walls—shrink. Lynx’s fingers traced absent patterns along West’s arm, and though the gesture was innocent, it lit a fire that West desperately tried to smother. He clenched his jaw, pretending it didn’t matter, pretending his heart wasn’t screaming for more.
“You’re quiet today,” Lynx said, leaning in closer. His eyes, a deep forest green, were laced with genuine concern. “Are you okay?”
West mustered a weak smile, though his throat felt tight. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he said, the lie tasting bitter on his tongue.
Across the table, Tye sat down with a grace that only seemed to amplify West’s inadequacies. West met his gaze briefly and immediately regretted it. There was no hostility in Tye’s brown eyes, just quiet strength and a kindness that West couldn’t resent no matter how much he wanted to.
“You’re working too hard again, huh?” Tye said, his tone easy but with a hint of teasing. “Lynx says you’ve been practically glued to your desk.”
West shrugged, looking away. “Just trying to keep busy.”
“Busy doing what?” Lynx interjected, his pout almost childlike. “You never make time for me anymore. Don’t you miss hanging out?”
West’s chest ached at the question. He didn’t trust himself to answer honestly, so he kept his tone light. “Of course, I do. Just… life, you know?”
Lynx frowned, his hand sliding down to clasp West’s. The touch was electric, sending a shiver down West’s spine. Lynx didn’t seem to notice the effect he had, but Tye did. His gaze flicked to their joined hands for a brief second before returning to his coffee. If there was jealousy, Tye hid it well. But West swore he saw something—a shadow of awareness, maybe even understanding.
West pulled his hand away, feigning a casualness he didn’t feel. “I’ll try to make more time,” he said, his voice hollow.
Lynx brightened immediately, his smile so radiant it almost made West forget the pain. Almost.
Flashback: The Swing Set Confession (Expanded)
The sun was warm against their backs as they sat beneath the swing set, their legs stretched out into the patchy grass. West leaned back on his hands, watching as Lynx fidgeted with a blade of grass, his usual vibrant energy replaced by an uncharacteristic stillness. Over the past year, West had come to know Lynx better than anyone—his quirks, his moods, the way he could light up a room without trying. But today, something felt off. Lynx hadn’t cracked a single joke, hadn’t teased him about his lopsided shoelaces or rambled about his latest comic obsession. Instead, he sat quietly, his head bowed, his shoulders slightly hunched, as if the weight of whatever he was holding in had become too much to bear.
West felt a pang of concern, the kind that only came when someone you cared about was hurting. Lynx had always been the one to bring light into West’s world, the one to drag him out of his shell with relentless warmth and stubborn kindness. Seeing him like this, subdued and withdrawn, made West’s stomach twist. He didn’t know what was wrong, but he knew he’d do whatever it took to make it better.
“You okay?” West asked softly, his voice carrying none of the usual teasing he reserved for their banter. He leaned forward, trying to catch Lynx’s eyes, his own heart beating a little faster with the unspoken worry that something was truly wrong.
Lynx didn’t answer right away, his fingers still toying with the grass. But then he glanced up, his green eyes meeting West’s with a mix of vulnerability and trust that made West’s chest tighten. In that moment, the world felt still—peaceful, uncomplicated, like this moment with Lynx was exactly where he was supposed to be.
Lynx’s fingers dug into the sand, his head bowed low as if he couldn’t face the weight of his own words. His voice trembled when he finally spoke. “West… I need to tell you something.”
West leaned in, his brow furrowing. “What is it?”
“I think…” Lynx’s breath hitched, and he shook his head as if trying to steady himself. “I think I like someone. But it’s not… it’s not a girl.” His voice cracked, the last words barely audible.
West’s heart clenched. “Lynx…”
“I think I like boys,” Lynx whispered, his eyes glistening as he looked up briefly, fear etched across his face. “And it scares me, West. It really scares me.”
West didn’t hesitate. “It’s okay,” he said, his voice firm but soft, desperate to ease the pain he saw in his friend’s eyes. “You’re okay, Lynx. You don’t have to be scared.”
West wanted nothing more than to pull him close, to promise him that nothing had changed. Yet deep inside, a strange warmth stirred, one he didn’t quite understand. 
As the words lingered between them, fragile and uncertain. West felt his chest tighten, his breath catching as a strange mix of emotions swelled within him. Hope flickered, hesitant but persistent, and his heart raced in a way he didn’t fully understand. He wasn’t ready to name the feeling, wasn’t ready to face the questions it stirred, but he couldn’t deny the spark of something special—a quiet thrill that made him want to hold onto this moment forever.
But then Lynx added, his voice steadier now, “I think I like Tye… you know, the guy I sit next to in science class.”
For a brief, fleeting moment, West had let himself imagine something beautiful, something he didn’t even know he wanted until it was gone. The realization hit like a blow, and it was as if the ground had been ripped out from under him. His unspoken hope shattered into jagged pieces, each one cutting deeper than the last. He forced a nod, swallowing hard, pretending he wasn’t breaking apart inside.
That’s amazing, Lynx!” West said, a spark of excitement lighting up his voice, masking the storm that churned deep inside. His smile was wide, genuine in its effort to bolster Lynx’s courage, even as his chest ached with unspoken feelings. “You should tell him—seriously. If anyone can make this work, it’s you.”
There was a brightness in his tone that Lynx couldn’t question, and West leaned in just enough to make his encouragement feel real. The storm inside raged on, but he pushed it further down, locking it away behind the genuine desire to see Lynx happy. If Lynx needed him to be his anchor, his cheerleader, West was ready—even if it meant silencing his own heart.
Later, though, when the moment had passed and Lynx’s smile no longer lit up the space between them, West would realize just how much harder this would be than he’d ever anticipated. And it broke him, not because Lynx had found someone else to care about, but because all West truly wanted was Lynx’s happiness. He had been authentic, true to his role as a friend, but it felt like a betrayal of his own heart. The weight of that duality—wanting Lynx’s joy at the cost of his own—was a pain he hadn’t been prepared for.
Present Day: Breaking Point
Back in the café, the storm outside was a distant murmur compared to the one brewing inside West. The memory of the playground lingered in his mind, a bittersweet echo of simpler days when Lynx’s attention had felt like it belonged solely to him. But those days were gone. Now, Lynx was in the middle of a story, his hands moving animatedly, his laughter filling the space between sentences, as if nothing had changed.
West tried to focus on Lynx’s voice, but his attention kept faltering. Tye shifted beside Lynx, and in a single, subtle motion, he pulled Lynx closer, their shoulders brushing. The gesture was casual, but it carried a quiet intimacy that struck West like a thunderclap. Lynx didn’t even seem to notice—his laughter flowed freely as he leaned into Tye’s pull, their knees brushing beneath the table. It wasn’t forced or hesitant; it was natural, as if their closeness was inevitable.
The ache in West’s chest deepened, growing heavier with each passing second. The storm inside him roared louder, drowning out the sound of Lynx’s laughter and the gentle hum of the café. He could see it so clearly now—Lynx belonged to Tye in a way West had always longed for but would never have. They shared something tangible, something solid, and West was on the outside looking in, an unwelcome spectator to the connection he craved.
The air in the café felt thicker, almost suffocating, as if the walls themselves were closing in on him. The warm glow of the lights and the hum of conversation faded into the background, leaving only the sound of his own heartbeat, pounding erratically in his chest. He clenched his jaw, his hands tightening around the mug in front of him, the ceramic cool against his trembling fingers.
He couldn’t bear it any longer. Watching Lynx smile at Tye, laugh with him, lean into him—it tore through West like a relentless storm, shredding every fragile piece of control he’d tried to hold onto. The realization was devastating, a tidal wave crashing through him: Lynx wasn’t his to hold, wasn’t his to love in the way his heart begged for. That truth felt like lightning, searing and inescapable, leaving nothing in its wake but the jagged edges of his own heartbreak.
“I should go,” West said, his voice sharper than he intended.
Lynx stopped mid-sentence, his green eyes snapping to West with surprise. “What? Why?”
“I just… remembered something I need to take care of,” West lied, grabbing his bag and avoiding Lynx’s gaze.
Lynx frowned, his fingers brushing lightly against West’s arm as if trying to anchor him. “Stay. Please. You don’t have to rush off.”
For a split second, West almost stayed. The pleading look in Lynx’s eyes was a lifeline he wanted desperately to hold on to. But the weight of his unspoken feelings dragged him down. Staying would only prolong the pain, and he wasn’t sure how much more he could take.
“Maybe next time,” West murmured, stepping back before Lynx could say anything else.
As West pushed the café door open, the cool January air hit him, sharp and biting. He didn’t look back, even though he could feel Lynx’s eyes on him, questioning, confused. As he stepped out into the rain, the cold droplets stung against his skin, sharp and unrelenting, but they felt like a relief compared to the suffocating heat of his own heartbreak.
The storm outside mirrored the one within him—wild, relentless, and impossible to outrun. And as West walked away, his chest aching with a pain he couldn’t name, he knew one thing for certain: he could never watch Lynx belong to someone else again.
Chapter 2: Drift
The rain drummed steadily against the window of West’s apartment, a quiet rhythm that usually helped ease his restless mind. Tonight, it did the opposite. The sound seemed to amplify the storm of emotions swirling inside him.
He sat at his desk, his head bowed, fingers gripping the edge as if holding on would keep him from falling apart. His eyes drifted to the bookshelf, to the small framed photo tucked between his books.
It was from a time when life felt easier—when it was just him and Lynx, side by side, unburdened by the weight of unspoken emotions. They were grinning, arms slung around each other, both soaked to the bone from a sudden summer rainstorm. He could almost hear Lynx’s laugh, so full of life, as they’d stood in the downpour without a care.
West couldn’t remember the last time he’d smiled like that.
Flashback: The Beginning of a Bond
It had been a gray, overcast day in Sixth grade when West first met Lynx. Lunch recess was the same as always: cliques forming their usual groups, the louder kids dominating the basketball courts, and the quieter ones huddling under the covered walkways. But Lynx didn’t fit into any of it.
West spotted him sitting alone at a weathered picnic table with his hood pulled up, a half-eaten sandwich in front of him. His light brown skin seemed to catch the sun that was peaking from the clouds, warm and beautiful in a way that felt almost out of place on this overcast day. His jet-black hair curled slightly at the edges, peeking out from under the hood. Something about the way he kept his head down, his shoulders hunched as if he were trying to disappear, made it impossible for West to look away.
Grabbing his brown paper lunch bag, West made his way over. “Mind if I sit?” he asked, his tone casual but warm.
Lynx looked up, his green eyes shadowed by a sadness West couldn’t place, though curiosity lingered just beneath. After a moment’s pause, he shrugged lightly. “Sure.”
That was all it took.
West sat down and started talking, filling the quiet space between them with stories about his favorite superhero comics, the video game he was saving up to buy, and the latest movie he was obsessed with. At first, Lynx said nothing, only nodding occasionally, his expression unreadable.
But then West cracked a joke—a cheesy one about  rusty spoons-and Lynx laughed. It wasn’t loud or boisterous, but it was real, and it lit up his face in a way West hadn’t expected.
“You’re kind of weird,” Lynx said, though there was no malice in his tone.
West grinned. “Yeah, but you’re laughing, so I must be doing something right.”
Lynx’s smile lingered, and something in his posture relaxed.
From that moment on, they were inseparable. Lynx became West’s shadow, and West became Lynx’s anchor. It was a bond that seemed unbreakable—until feelings got in the way.
Flashback: Escaping Chaos
West’s house had always been chaotic in its own way. His mom worked double shifts at the hospital, leaving behind warm leftovers and weary smiles, while his dad’s temper often echoed through the small house like distant thunder. But it was still a refuge, a place where West had carved out a sense of stability amidst the noise. For Lynx, it was something even more—a safe haven.
Lynx never said much about what went on behind the closed doors of his own home. He didn’t have to. West saw it in the way Lynx flinched at sudden movements, in the quiet sadness that lingered in his eyes after weekends spent “with family.” There were bruises Lynx thought he hid well and silences that spoke louder than words.
One night, Lynx showed up at West’s doorstep, drenched from a sudden downpour. Rain dripped from his hair and soaked his too-thin jacket. His face was pale, and his hands trembled as they clutched the straps of his backpack.
West didn’t ask questions. He just pulled him inside without a word, grabbed the thickest blanket from the couch, and wrapped it around Lynx’s shoulders. “Sit,” West said gently, steering him toward the sofa. A few minutes later, he returned with a steaming mug of cocoa, the scent of chocolate filling the small living room.
Lynx held the mug with both hands, his fingers shaking slightly. West sat beside him, leaving enough space to breathe but close enough to offer comfort. “You don’t have to talk about it,” West said softly. “But you’re safe here. Always.”
Without a word, West reached for the hem of Lynx’s shirt, his movements slow and deliberate, giving Lynx a moment to stop him. When no resistance came, he lifted the fabric gently, revealing the canvas of bruises and cuts scattered across Lynx’s chest and sides. The sight hit West like a punch to the gut, stealing his breath as a wave of anguish and anger surged inside him. He didn’t ask where they came from; he didn’t need to. The story was written in every dark bloom of a bruise and every jagged line of a cut.
Lynx flinched slightly as the cool air touched his skin, his gaze fixed on the mug in his trembling hands. West’s throat tightened, but he said nothing. He retrieved the small tin of ointment from the first-aid kit they both knew so well by now. This wasn’t the first time West had done this, and the familiarity of it—the quiet, the care—only made it hurt more.
West’s hands worked with a gentleness that belied the storm brewing inside him. He dabbed the ointment onto a particularly deep cut, his fingers brushing against Lynx’s skin. He tried not to notice the warmth beneath his touch, the way Lynx’s lean frame seemed so fragile and yet so strong all at once. His gaze lingered a moment too long on the curve of Lynx’s shoulder, the faint line of a scar that hadn’t been there before.
As he worked, West caught glimpses of the emotions Lynx tried so hard to hide—the flicker of pain in his eyes, the way his jaw tightened as if to hold back something he couldn’t say. The silence between them was heavy, but it wasn’t empty. It was filled with all the things West wished he could fix, all the ways he longed to protect the boy sitting next to him.
For a moment, Lynx didn’t move. His lip quivered, and his green eyes shone with unshed tears. Then, as if the weight of everything he’d been holding in became too much, Lynx broke.
The tears came suddenly, his shoulders shaking as sobs wracked his body. West froze for a moment, startled by the intensity of it, before instinct took over. He pulled Lynx into his arms, holding him tightly, one hand gently stroking his damp hair.
“It’s okay,” West murmured, his voice low and soothing. “I’ve got you.”
Lynx clung to him like he was a lifeline, and in that moment, West realized something: it wasn’t just about being there for Lynx as a friend. It was about wanting to protect him, to shield him from the world in a way that felt deeper than anything West had ever known.
Flashback: The Playful Moments
Not every moment was heavy. There were lighthearted days that balanced the weight of the hard ones, moments that reminded West what joy felt like—pure, unfiltered, and alive.
On weekends, they’d retreat to West’s room, where Lynx would kick off his shoes, sprawl across the bed like he owned the place, and challenge West to marathon gaming sessions. Their laughter would fill the small space, drowning out the rest of the world.
“Why are you playing the guy with the frying pan again?” West groaned as Lynx’s absurd character onscreen landed another ridiculous hit.
“Because it’s hilarious,” Lynx replied, grinning. “And because you can’t stop losing to him.”
West rolled his eyes but couldn’t help the smile tugging at his lips. “You’re insufferable.”
“And yet, you keep inviting me over,” Lynx teased, leaning sideways to nudge West’s shoulder. His smile was wide, his green eyes bright with mischief.
West glanced at him, and for a fleeting second, time seemed to slow. Lynx’s laughter, the soft glow of the sunlight streaming through the window, the way his dark hair fell across his forehead—it all felt so vivid, so alive.
West’s chest tightened, a strange warmth spreading through him. It wasn’t new, not really. He’d felt it in quiet moments before, in the way Lynx’s presence made everything feel lighter. But now, it was undeniable.
“You’re staring,” Lynx said, his voice teasing but soft.
“Am not,” West shot back quickly, heat rising to his cheeks as he turned back to the screen.
Lynx let out a quiet laugh and shifted closer, his knee brushing against West’s. “Sure, Westie. Whatever you say.”
As they continued their game, West tried to focus, but his thoughts kept drifting. He didn’t know when it had started—this growing feeling that Lynx wasn’t just his best friend, that there was something deeper underneath it all. All he knew was that Lynx’s laughter made his heart race, and his presence made everything else seem easier to bear.
Chapter 3: The Breaking Point
The weight of the memory clung to him as the present came rushing back, pulling West out of the past and into the stillness of his apartment. The familiar creak of the radiator hummed softly in the background, but it offered no comfort, no reprieve from the ache in his chest. The photo frame in his hand trembled slightly before he set it down, face-first, as if hiding it could somehow dull the longing that had crept back into his heart.
The laughter frozen in that picture felt like a distant echo, a reminder of what he’d had with Lynx and what had changed between them. West leaned back in his chair, running a hand through his hair as his gaze drifted to the window. The storm outside mirrored the one inside him, rain streaking down the glass like tears he refused to shed. It wasn’t just the memory of their good times that stung—it was the realization of how much he’d let himself want something he could never have.
Every shared moment that once felt effortless now carried a weight that pressed down on his chest, suffocating and relentless. What tore at him most wasn’t just the impossibility of it all—it was the thought of Lynx giving those smiles, those touches, and the warmth that felt like home, to someone else. The idea of Lynx finding solace in another’s arms, sharing secrets and laughter with someone who wasn’t him, was a torment he couldn’t shake.
 
The soft creak of the door snapped West from his thoughts. His pulse spiked, and for a moment, he held his breath. The sound of familiar footsteps—light but deliberate—crossed the threshold, and West’s heart clenched.
“West?” Lynx’s voice was quiet but carried the weight of concern.
West turned his head slightly, just enough to see Lynx standing there in the faint light of the lamp. His long black hair, still damp from the rain, clung to his face, framing those striking green eyes that always seemed to hold a universe of emotions. His jacket was soaked, droplets glistening on the fabric, but Lynx didn’t seem to notice.
“Lynx,” West said hoarsely, his voice barely audible. “What are you doing here, how did you get in here” 
Lynx tilted his head, a flicker of confusion crossing his face. “You gave me a key, remember? I let myself in. You weren’t answering your phone, and I…” He hesitated, his gaze softening. “I was worried about you.”
West felt his chest tighten, his stomach twisting painfully. That’s what Lynx did—he cared so deeply, so earnestly, without reservation. And it was that care, that openness, that made it all the more unbearable for West to carry the secret he’d been holding onto for years.
“You didn’t have to come,” West murmured, his eyes darting back to the photo on his desk.
Lynx stepped closer, his brow furrowed. “Of course I did. You left the café so suddenly. You’ve been pulling away for weeks now. Did I… did I do something wrong?”
West’s heart broke at the hurt in Lynx’s voice. He turned away, gripping the edge of the desk until his knuckles turned white. “No, Lynx. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Then why does it feel like I’m losing you?” Lynx asked, his voice cracking slightly.
The rawness in his tone made West’s resolve falter. He turned back, his eyes meeting Lynx’s, and for a moment, the emotions he’d kept bottled up threatened to spill over. “You’re not losing me,” West said, his voice trembling.
“Then tell me what’s going on,” Lynx pleaded, stepping even closer. His presence was overwhelming—his warmth, his scent, the way he looked at West like he wanted to understand, to fix whatever was broken.
But this wasn’t something Lynx could fix.
“I can’t,” West said, shaking his head. “You wouldn’t understand.”
“Try me,” Lynx pressed, his hand reaching out to lightly touch West’s arm.
The touch burned in the best and worst way, and it was too much. West pulled back abruptly, his breath coming in sharp, uneven gasps. “Stop, Lynx. Just stop.”
Lynx froze, his hand dropping to his side. The silence between them was deafening, and West could feel the weight of Lynx’s hurt and confusion pressing down on him.
“I can’t keep doing this,” West finally said, his voice breaking.
“Doing what?” Lynx asked, his tone desperate.
West turned away, his hands trembling as he raked one through his hair, desperate to find the words. His heart was pounding, each beat a painful reminder of everything he was too afraid to say. “Pretending,” he muttered, his voice strained. “Pretending that everything’s fine, that I’m fine.” The words felt foreign, unsteady, as he tried to gather the courage to speak the truth buried deep inside him.
What he wanted to say was, “Pretending… that it doesn’t kill me to see you with someone else, to know that you’ll never—” But his voice caught in his throat, choking on the vulnerability that threatened to spill out. Admitting it felt like stepping off a cliff, the ground beneath him vanishing with no guarantee of a soft landing.
Instead, the pressure erupted in the worst way possible. “I can’t do this, Lynx,” he blurted, his voice sharper than he intended. “I can’t deal with you right now. I can’t keep this up—these feelings.”
Lynx froze, his eyes wide, confusion etched into his face. “West…” he began, his voice soft, careful, as though he were approaching a wounded animal.
“Don’t,” West snapped, his shoulders shaking as he clenched his fists at his sides. He couldn’t bear to look at Lynx, couldn’t stand to see the hurt in his eyes. “Please, Lynx. Don’t say anything. Just… just go.”
Lynx took a hesitant step forward, but the wall West had built around himself was impenetrable. “I don’t understand,” Lynx said quietly, his voice laced with both hurt and confusion. “What did I do? What’s wrong?”
West finally turned to face him, his expression raw, his eyes filled with tears he refused to let fall. “You didn’t do anything,” he said bitterly, his voice barely above a whisper. “I did. That’s the problem. So just… please. Leave.”
“I’m not leaving,” Lynx said firmly, his voice steady despite the emotion in his eyes. He stepped closer again, this time slower, like he was approaching a wounded animal. “West, look at me.”
West hesitated, but the weight of Lynx’s gaze drew him in. When their eyes met, the intensity in Lynx’s expression made West’s breath catch.
“I don’t know what you think I feel—or don’t feel,” Lynx said quietly. “But I need you to know something: you’re the most important person in my life. Always have been.”
The words hit West like a punch to the gut. He wanted to believe them, to hold onto the possibility that they meant more than what they seemed. But the fear, the doubt, the pain—it was all too much.
“You don’t mean that,” West whispered, his voice cracking.
“I do,” Lynx insisted, stepping even closer. “And I hate that you’re hurting, that I’ve done something to make you feel this way. But West… you have to let me in. Please.”
West’s defenses crumbled, and the tears he’d been holding back finally spilled over. Lynx didn’t hesitate—he pulled West into his arms, holding him tightly as the storm inside him broke free.
For the first time in years, West let himself be vulnerable, let himself be held. And as Lynx’s fingers gently ran through his hair, whispering words of comfort, West allowed himself to hope—just a little—that maybe, just maybe, he wouldn’t have to carry this alone anymore.
Three Weeks Earlier
The storm outside was relentless, the kind of rain that drowned out everything but its own roaring insistence. West had been stretched out on his couch, a blanket tangled around his legs, half-watching a super hero movie he seen a thousands times already. He was too restless, his thoughts circling back to Lynx like they always seemed to do.
When the knock came, he almost didn’t hear it over the downpour. But the sound repeated, faint yet urgent. West’s heart leapt into his throat as he hurried to the door.
Lynx stood there, drenched to the bone, his hair clinging to his face, water dripping from his clothes and pooling on the welcome mat. His red-rimmed eyes, swollen with unshed tears, met West’s, and for a moment, it was like stepping back in time. West could almost see the teenage version of Lynx on his doorstep after another fight with his dad—his shoulders hunched, his knuckles raw, and his face a mask of anger and hurt he tried so hard to hide. Back then, Lynx had stood in the same spot, drenched and broken, and West had always been the one to pull him inside, to offer warmth and safety without question. Seeing Lynx like this now, vulnerable and soaked to the core, stirred something deep in West, a fierce need to protect the person who had always meant more to him than he could ever put into words.
“Lynx?” West’s voice was thick with concern. “What happened? Are you okay?”
“I had to get out of there,” Lynx said, his voice raw and shaking. “We fought again. He came home late, and I just—” His voice cracked. “I can’t do this anymore.”
West didn’t hesitate. He stepped aside, grabbing Lynx’s wrist and pulling him inside. The warmth of the apartment was a stark contrast to the chill of Lynx’s soaked body.
“Come here,” West said softly, draping a towel over Lynx’s shoulders. Lynx collapsed into his arms without another word, his body trembling with suppressed sobs.
West held him tightly, his chest aching at the pain etched into Lynx’s every movement. He hated this. Hated that Lynx was hurting, hated that someone else had caused it. All West wanted was to protect him, to shield him from every heartbreak, every tear.
“You’re safe here,” West murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. “You’ll always be safe with me.”
Lynx didn’t answer, but the way he clung to West spoke volumes.
West guided Lynx into the dimly lit bathroom, his hands trembling as he peeled the soaked fabric from Lynx’s cold, shivering frame. The wet clothes clung stubbornly to Lynx’s lean body, revealing every curve and angle as they came away. West tried to focus on the task, on the need to get his friend warm, but the sight of Lynx’s bare skin caught him off guard. The way the water clung to his slender muscles, tracing the lines of his chest and arms, was both breathtaking and disarming.
Lynx’s body shook violently as he finally let the tears fall, his sobs ragged and broken. Without thinking, West pulled him close, wrapping his arms tightly around him. Lynx buried his face in West’s shoulder, his tears soaking into West’s shirt. West’s heart ached at the raw pain pouring out of his friend, the depth of his love for Lynx swelling in his chest until it felt like it might burst. His hand moved instinctively, stroking the curve of Lynx’s back, his fingers grazing damp, chilled skin in a gesture of comfort. The closeness was intoxicating, leaving West caught between heartbreak and the undeniable pull of his own feelings.
“You’re safe,” West murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, his breath warm against Lynx’s ear. He held him tighter, wanting to shield him from whatever had brought him to this moment.
When Lynx finally began to calm, his sobs fading into uneven breaths, West eased back just enough to meet his tear-streaked eyes. Without a word, he helped guide Lynx toward the tub. The water steamed softly, curling into the cold air as West knelt to steady him. His gaze darted away, his cheeks burning as Lynx slid into the bath, the intimacy of the moment almost too much to bear. Every part of West wanted to stay, to take Lynx’s pain away entirely, but he forced himself to stand and step back, his heart hammering in his chest. The image of Lynx—vulnerable, beautiful, and utterly broken—would linger long after he closed the door behind him.
West cursed under his breath, willing the thoughts away, but they clung to him like the rain still clinging to his skin. This wasn’t the time for those feelings, no matter how deeply they ran or how much they threatened to overwhelm him. Lynx needed him right now—needed comfort, not the weight of West’s unspoken emotions.
He turned quickly, forcing himself to focus, rummaging through drawers in search of dry clothes. His hands moved with a kind of frantic purpose, pulling out a worn sweatshirt and soft flannel pants, anything that might offer warmth. The task helped steady him, kept his mind occupied, though the image of Lynx’s tear-streaked face and trembling body refused to leave him. Shaking his head, West gripped the bundle of clothes tighter and took a deep breath, trying to push the storm inside him back down. Lynx came first—he always did.
By the time Lynx emerged, dressed in one of West’s old T-shirts and a pair of sweats that fit snugly on his lean frame, West’s chest felt unbearably tight. The sight of him seemed to steal the air from the room. The shirt clung to his torso, just a little too small, and the dampness from Lynx’s still-wet hair had left faint patches of fabric sticking to his skin. West forced himself to busy his hands, grabbing the discarded towel and straightening the edge of the couch cushion, anything to keep his thoughts from spiraling. But his gaze kept betraying him, flickering back to Lynx, who moved with a quiet fragility, like the weight of his pain might collapse him at any moment.
West’s emotions raged like a storm, the desperate need to pull Lynx close and shield him from his pain crashing against the sharp fear of crossing a line that shouldn’t be touched. Lynx was caught in his own tempest, needing comfort, not chaos, and the last thing West wanted was to add to the storm swirling around him. But no matter how much West tried to steady himself, the winds of his own feelings tore through him—wild, overwhelming, and unrelenting—leaving him wondering if he could weather this storm without being swept away entirely.
“You okay?” West asked, his voice rough.
Lynx nodded, his expression softening. “Better. Thanks to you.”
West swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Good.”
West had planned to sleep on the couch. He’d even grabbed a pillow and blanket, convincing himself it was the right thing to do—to keep some distance, to stop his emotions from getting the better of him. But Lynx had stopped him before he could take a step, his fingers wrapping gently around West’s wrist. His voice was soft, almost pleading. “Stay.”
West hesitated, searching Lynx’s eyes, and what he saw there unraveled his resolve completely. There was a rawness, a vulnerability that reached past all of West’s walls. He couldn’t say no. Not to Lynx. Not when it was clear he needed comfort more than anything else.
The bed felt impossibly small as they lay down together. Lynx curled into West’s side, his arm draping across West’s waist like it belonged there, his face pressed lightly against West’s shoulder. Their legs brushed under the covers, a quiet intimacy that made West’s chest tighten. The warmth of Lynx’s body against his was overwhelming, grounding and electrifying all at once.
West stared at the ceiling, his mind spinning. He could feel the steady rise and fall of Lynx’s breathing, the way his fingers unconsciously tightened against West’s side. It should have been simple—just two friends offering comfort in the dark—but the tension between them was anything but. Every shift, every touch, felt charged, as if one wrong move could spark something they couldn’t take back.
And yet, there was something heartbreakingly sweet about it too. The way Lynx clung to him, the way West’s hand found its way to Lynx’s back, rubbing gentle circles as if to say, I’m here. It was tender, authentic—a moment steeped in unspoken emotions that neither of them dared to name. And though West’s heart ached with the weight of everything unsaid, he let himself sink into the closeness, cherishing the fleeting moment before reality crept back in.
The room was silent except for the faint hum of the radiator and the soft rhythm of Lynx’s breathing, but to West, it felt deafening. They were facing each other now, close enough for West to see every detail—the way Lynx’s lashes brushed his cheeks when his eyes fluttered closed, the faint curve of his lips, the damp strands of his hair sticking to his forehead. Lynx’s arm rested loosely around West’s waist, their bodies barely separated, a fragile sliver of space that felt both impossible to cross and devastating to leave unbroken.

I had emotionally left the building, a while ago... Maybe around the time I planned our anniversary getaway, booked an AirBnB near a lake, and he was unablento contribute $, so it was on me to pay for his beer and petrol to even get is home (2 hours away), we watched stand up comedy for 2 hours til he crashed out drunk. No romance,.no intimacy. He was angry in the morning as I'd got up early to make coffee. 

I left him.... and went to stay with my parents twice over the last 6 months. 
During one period where I'd returned to ""rekindle things"" after hearing loads of empty promises and sob stories.... He wouldn't stop fucking me anally in the shower after I'd said stop. I kinda realized later and discussed with him that I don't feel he understands consent.....

Third time's a charm, it seems, and i left without a word one morning, and couldn't face going back. 
Now he's sending scathing messages about what I've put him through, mostly the abandonment of our marriage and financial pressure I left him to manage.

1i392a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i392a9/the_withdrawal_part_1/,The Withdrawal (Part 1),"I think it's safe to say that 2020 was a year most people would rather forget for reasons that I'm sure I don't even need to go into, and really the context of it all isn't that important to this story but what is important was the effect - the lockdowns, the mandatory isolation.

What could be better than being cooped up with your family and nowhere to escape except the maddening enclosure that was your room? I was 15 at the time and honestly I don't think I could have conjured up a worse scenario for me to be stuck in, I was at the age where I wanted to be out of the house and smoking weed with my pals and drinking whiskey in parks until the sun came up - my very own stereotypical high-school movie experience, I was in the middle of my turn at getting to have some silly, lived in fantasy's of party's and girls and everything else, and right where I felt as if I was approaching a golden era of my life the pandemic happened.

It was a weird time, it almost felt like a surreal day dream that everyone was in on, the sudden surge of user activity on the internet, the barren and desolate city centers, all mixed with the news constantly showing us the evolving horrors of it all. It felt apocalyptic.

With all that said, there was no global crisis that could even come close to contending with the trauma inflicted on me from what I'd come to learn and discover in my house during that year.

Things that just shouldn't happen. The kind of stuff you'd think only happens in horror films or true crime documentaries.

It all began when my sister Amy started showing signs of drug withdrawals.

The thing is, Amy has always been kind of reclusive in her personality, and that's not to say she's anti-social or rude, quite the opposite, but there is an air of method to her. Everything she says goes through what seems like a pretty intensive process before she commits, which can create some awkward silences and flows in conversation that can feel a touch too gradual, but she simply has to pick the 'right' thing to say. This attitude and internal make-up can be applied to most areas of her life, she doesn't do things on a whim or in the moment, she is the furthest possible distance away from being a spontaneous and free-spirit. Amy is calculated. Everything in order. Ducks lined up with deliberation and pretense.

As I'm sure you can imagine, the isolation was basically torture for her.

At first that's what I thought it was, cabin fever; she was moody and snappy and erratic and tense and at times , she looked downright sickly. It was when the mental symptoms started to manifest into physical ailments that I really started to notice and worry, my parents naturally *freaked the fuck out* at first; made her isolate in her room, forced swab tests on her, but she was clean.

No identifiable illness, no contagions, yet the symptoms persisted.

Another thing that's important to know about Amy is that she's *never* and I mean *never, ever* done illicit drugs, that was more my cup of brandy whereas hers was light roasted coffee if she felt especially dangerous. I wouldn't say she was straight as an arrow or anything, but the idea of her being addicted to something like Oxy or Xanax was so beyond out of character that it was teetering on being comical - so why did she look like she was?

Why was she so worn down, and unwell? It worried all of us, our parents especially, I mean she would barely even talk to us. Just sat in her room on her PC doing whatever it was she did, usually indulging one of her many dorky hobby's like programming and something-something data- something-or-other, I don't know. She's smart, I'm not. But I was worried about her.

Regardless of what I may have told you 5 years ago as a snotty 15 year old, I've always loved and looked up to Amy. She is my older sister, granted, so there's a natural kinship there where I model some of the things I do based off her example even if I didn't quite realize it, but her lack of regard for how others saw her, what they thought of her, the way it had no impact on how she carried herself was pretty awe-inspiring to me growing up. She really just didn't give a fuck.

I, on the other hand, could barely contain myself and was grossly seeking approval from other people. Amy set what seemed like a healthy example of self-assuredness, confidence, and innate trust in who you are

Unfortunately, there was much more to it.

Amy wasn't well, and I didn't mean just since lockdown and all this happened, but I would come to learn that Amy was *really* not well. Mentally ill to a degree I to this day struggle to comprehend - In fact, to put it bluntly, she was, no, *is* \- completely fucking deranged.

Her lack of regard for how others saw her was rooted not in confidence but in apathy, something that I'd not have believed should you have told me as a young'un.

She was incredible at masking what festered beneath.

Like.... *incredible*, scary good.

The first night she snuck out I was flabbergasted, what the hell could be so important that she'd risk getting all of us sick? Potentially killing us? Sure, there wasn't many people lurking around the streets as *most* of them had that commonsense, but regardless, she was risking it. All of us. It was at this moment that I realized she must really be addicted to something. It was kind of mind blowing to think about.

Amy, fuckin' *Amy Scott* was revolting against the common authorities to score some mystery substance? Huh? Maybe she was seeing someone? No... No that wouldn't make sense. But why? Why would she be out there?

If she really was going out to score drugs, I made a solemn but sincere promise to myself that I'd kill the fucker who supplied her.

Hindsight can be awful.

Being the kind of kid I was back then, you know - snoopy,  had no concept of boundaries, overly worrying, generally annoying- when I noticed she snuck out I made sure that I'd use the time efficiently.

I wasn't sure how long she was going to be gone for, could be as many minutes or as few hours as I was willing to imagine, the only blueprint I had was knowing that she wouldn't want to come back anywhere near the time that mum and dad would be awake.

Regardless of my assumptions I'd settled on 5 minutes, 10 minutes maximum.

All I wanted to do was get a sense of what I, nay, what *we* were dealing with.

We're family, after all, and while you definitely shouldn't invade the privacy of your siblings and break their trust by going into their nest and shoving your nose where it doesn't belong, my justification for it was that she needed help but wasn't sure how to ask for it.

Well, fear not, Ames, your brother is here to valiantly save the day.

The white knight you never asked for and certainly never wanted.

When I entered her room, I was immediately met with the first fragment of darkness she'd been keeping.

It seared its way into my developing brain, sizzling and nestling into a demented core memory, burned into my dreams like a branding iron.

Her PC was paused on a video, a video that at initial glance was more camera fuzz and blurred crimson than any perceivable image, but when I moved the cursor and highlighted the title I had to do a triple take to make sure I was reading it right,

""2 men 1 chainsaw""

When I clicked play, what I saw made my stomach turn.

It was snuff.

An unmistakably real snuff video of what looked to be members of the Mexican cartel butchering two men who were chained to a wall in a dingy, damp looking basement.

The wall behind them was stained in various shades of red, pink and yellow.

Usually when people encounter this kind of content, *usually* its by their own accord, sure it will still shock them, traumatize them, maybe they'll lose their lunch, but they still make that choice.   
They lead themselves there by the leash of morbid curiosity.

I didn't.

I stumbled on it.

Stumbled on two men being not just murdered, but *tortured.*

The perpetrators were belly laughing so loud it almost overshadowed the dampening revs and whirs as they surgically flayed and dismembered their victims, you could tell they were trying to keep their victims alive as long as possible, keep them screaming and crying.

I almost threw up on the screen, but before I lost control, I recomposed my self and shakily paused the video.

When I paused, that's when I saw the other tabs.

Dozens, all with similar titles.

""1 bitch, 1 dog"", ""1 man 1 icepick"", and other titles I would really rather not repeat, to maintain whatever innocence I have left.

*what.*

*the.*

*fuck?!*

Surely, she is just engaging in some morbid curiosity, right? Right? Maybe she is studying it. Maybe she is interested in the anatomy of it.

Surely, she can't enjoy this. She wouldn't enjoy something like this, would she? How could she? This was the most vile thing I'd ever laid eyes on.

Why did she have so many tabs open?

There were literally dozens and dozens of them, and they seemed to get worse the further down the line you went.

Demented, disgusting ducklings all a part of some fucked up viewing experience Amy had curated.

My mind was a whirl-wind, my stomach a sink-hole, I must have been standing there for... god, I don't even know, my fight or flight response malfunctioned and I was frozen in place.

My mind everywhere and nowhere all at once, my first ever bout of disassociation.

Probably my first serious traumatic event, like, there was \*no way\* I would ever un-see or un-learn any of this.

It was right as I began to properly process what I'd seen, and going over just a morsel of the possibilities of what this could possibly mean for Amy, that the bedroom window opened and she started crawling through.

Her eyes widened as she stealthily planted herself on the ground.

The eye contact was burning a hole through my skull.

She sported a black hoodie that was snugly draped over her head, her bangs messy and frizzled.

Her facemask was ripe with sweat, the material pulling in and pushing out as her breath tried to catch up to her, tiny flickers of moisture managing to escape.

She was trembling. Shaking. Like she had absorbed too much energy and her body was rejecting it to maintain balance.

But something was different.

She wasn't fatigued, or sickly, or distant, she was.... lively.

In fact, she looked elated.

As elated as anyone could be who's brother just busted them for their fucked up viewing habits, but elated nonetheless.

Shockingly peaceful all things considered.

""Uh, yeah. Hey... Amy, uh. Look"" I say to her, sheepish and shaky,

She shushed me with a whisper so faint it barely registered, her finger raising to her mouth being the main communicator.

She removed her mask, revealing a stern and stoic expression of total vacancy.

The silence was thick.

I waited for her inner-process to finish and deliver me some one-liner of snarky wisdom as she so often would.

But she didn't.

She just looked at me, a deer in headlights, an expression of resentful elation that mixed and melted with impatience the more the silence lingered.

""I'll... I didn't... I won't say anything. Let's just forge-""

She cut me off with a tone of voice that was drenched in menace and authority

***""Never, ever  acknowledge what you saw in here. Not to me. Not to Mum. Not to Dad. Never. Never. Don't make me repeat it. Don't ever fucking make me repeat what I just said***.  ***Now, get the fuck out of my room. Right fucking now, Isaac.""***

The cold and malicious delivery of her words was more frightening than anything else that happened that night.

I hurried out of her room as silently as possible as to not stir the hive and invite more stress into this situation, the last thing I'd need right now is to answer mum's daily 20 questions - I made my way into my bedroom and gently closed the door, leaning against it and realizing what had just happened.

Who was that? Who is she? Do I know my own sister? Because the way she spoke, looked, held herself.... that wasn't the Amy I grew up with. Like an imposter wearing Amy's skin. I couldn't believe how scared she'd made me feel. *Amy*, scaring me?

It was so much to process, and then like a light switch or a terrible miracle,

*I remembered it.*

*The first detail that would spark the end of my childhood.*

*The little drops of blood that decorated her fringe.*",7,1737090490.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/s/itmq1wKaXz)  **March 16, 2019**

I'm a 27-year-old woman with three male roommates who are all grad students. I'm in the master bedroom and they all are on the other side of the house; they're all also about two years younger than me so there's kind of a ""House Mom"" role that I've fallen into. I don't mind it most of the time because I'm like, ""Hey guys, don't forget to do X"" and then they do it, but the cleanliness issue is one that I really can't get over.

When I cook, I either clean the dishes as I'm cooking or I soak them in the sink for a little while and then clean them within the next couple of hours. My roommates... they just let that sit there.

I got annoyed about two weeks ago because I went to make myself some pasta and there were so many dishes in the sink that I couldn't actually clean my pan. Out of frustration (and probably a little bit of passive aggression) I just cleaned all the dishes, then waited for a time when the guys were home to let them know.

>Me: Hey, I went to wash a pan earlier and there was no space in the sink. I know you guys are busy with classes, but there's got to be some way to get your dishes clean within 48 hours of them being dirtied that way we don't get this pile-up and I don't feel like you guys are leaving the household chores to me.  
>  
>The Guys: Oh my god, of course our dishes aren't your responsibility! We're sorry. From now on, you don't have to worry about it. ***Only do the dishes that are yours.***

Fast forward to about three days ago. Roommate 1(Nathan) is going out of state to visit family, roommate 2 (Luciano) is in South America with his labmates, and roommate 3 (Sanjit) is probably at his girlfriend's place. They all disappeared like a whisper in the wind, and I woke up the next day realizing that not only were none of the guys here, but they left a bunch of dishes in the sink.

Now, we live in the South, and it's just starting to get warm outside. There are bugs, and those bugs get attracted to grossness that gets left out on counters. It's day 3, and all kinds of gnats and flies are gathering around their dishes. Normally I'd be so incensed that I would just clean it all, but you know what... I refuse to wash their disgusting dishes because ***they told me I didn't have to***. I'm not even going in the kitchen right now it's so nasty.

Thankfully being in the master bedroom means I have my own bathroom, and I've decided for the hell of it that I'm just gonna wash my dishes in the bathroom sink, which is (*surprise surprise)* BUG FREE. Tomorrow two of them get back from their trips. I plan to give absolutely zero craps when they realize that this is what happens when they leave all the kitchen work for the woman of the house to do.

Update on 3/17 4:30pm EST - Not all the roommates are even back yet, guys! I'm getting so many PMs asking for updates. You gotta chill, people! Let the madness unfold so I can give you a full post tonight or tomorrow morning.


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/s/g7vFpmxjEu)  **March 17, 2019**

**UPDATE: Just do the dishes that are mine? ~The Conclusion~**

**HALT, TRAVELER.** Before reading on, [check out my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/b1xed0/just_do_the_dishes_that_are_mine_have_fun_with/), if you haven't already.

Done with that? Good. Let's continue...

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

WHEW. Well, hey guys! This really blew up, huh? I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting my post to get so upvoted and commented on, so I'm guessing that means I'm not the only one who's been in this situation.

First off, to those of you saying I should just move the dishes into their rooms: That wouldn't be maliciously complying! Nobody told me to move dirty dishes. :P Also that would have required me touching everything, which I truly did not want to do. I'll keep this strategy in mind for the future when I'm in more of a ""petty revenge"" mood, though.

To those of you who said I was just setting up my house for a bug infestation... it's an old rental house in the woods in the South. Bugs are an unfortunate inevitability that we have to stay on top of. Normally, they kind of hang around the trash can, which is gross, but whatever, it's trash, and I usually spray the can down with Raid whenever we take it out. Either way, it's not my job to prevent the house from getting infested. It's everyone's job! That's the whole point!

Anyway, *moving on*. Because my roommates all came home at different times, you're going to have to know them individually, so here are some fake names:

>Roommate 1 who went to visit family is **""Nathan""**  
>  
>Roommate 2 who went to South America is **""Luciano""**  
>  
>Roommate 3 who was hanging out with his girlfriend is **""Sanjit""**

Again, not real, just trying to keep them distinct so you don't get mixed up on who is who.

So, first we have **Sanjit,** who came home last night with his girlfriend. As far as I can tell, they skipped the kitchen entirely and went straight to his room. This morning, though, I was unlucky enough to be woken up by my cat's claw in my foot at like 7am, so I was very awake and heard them shuffle into the kitchen for coffee. Sanjit said it was ""fucking gross"" in the kitchen, and his girlfriend agreed. Sanjit proceeded to say something like, ""This is why I don't even want to cook in here."" It's true; Sanjit doesn't cook very often, he mostly gets delivery. So, I could safely assume that the dishes did not belong to Sanjit. He and his girlfriend left the house not long after I heard this conversation.

Next to arrive was **Nathan,** around 2 in the afternoon. I was actually out in the back yard hosing down my cat's litterbox (it is the other part of the house that commonly attracts bugs) when he pulled into the driveway. I heard him enter the house but I didn't want to be standing in the living room waiting for him, so unfortunately I didn't see the initial reaction. When I did go back inside, he was in his room unpacking from his trip. But there was still that gross little *buzz buzz buzz* around the dishware.

I went into my room to reassemble the litter box, and then started browsing Reddit, like you do. After about two hours went by and there was zero kitchen activity, I started to get anxious. I gotta say, some of your comments worried me, folks. *""They won't care,"" ""They're YOUR bugs now,""* etc etc. I seriously started thinking, ""What if they really just don't give a shit and these dishes get ignored for another 48 hours? What if I got myself worked up for nothing?""

So I actually came up with plan B. Plan A, of course, was The Best Timeline, a beautiful moment of clarity where all the roommates recognized that communal living is a team effort and we all have to do our part to get by. Barring that, plan B would be to wait until all roommates were home yet again and corral them in the kitchen to say, ""Look at this shit. This is bugs. You literally left your dishes for OVER THREE DAYS for me to do, and don't tell me you didn't. There's the bleach, there's the insecticide. Get to work."" My blood was boiling a little just thinking about it, and I can be kind of scary for a little lady, so part of me was actually kind of hoping I would get to do plan B and let off some steam.

Thankfully, at one point Nathan came out of his room and started making a frozen pizza in the kitchen. I heard some dishes clang, the oven door open/close, and the sweet smell of pepperoni filling the air. A few more dishes clanged, and then Nathan started coming by my room. I heard him before I saw him.

>**Nathan:** Hey, Witty! *(that's me)*  
>  
>**Me:** Hey man, how was your trip?  
>  
>**Nathan:** Good, I'm just jetlagged. What happened in here?  
>  
>**Me:** What do you mean?  
>  
>**Nathan:** Like, did something... is something rotting in the garbage disposal?  
>  
>**Me:** You talking about the bugs? I mean, that's what happens when shit gets left out like that and then everyone leaves town.  
>  
>**Nathan:** *(makes a face as if to say, ""gross"")*  
>  
>**Me:** Yeah, it's pretty gross. There's cleaning stuff in the cabinet underneath, if you're looking for it.  
>  
>**Nathan:** *(sigh)* Cool, thanks.

He walked off looking very sullen, like Charlie Brown on a bad day. The nice part of the ""House Mom"" thing is that at the very least, when I do explicitly tell someone to do something, they do it. So, as pouty as Nathan was, he started cleaning while his pizza cooked.

In my head I was just screaming, ""HOORAYY!!!!"" I did a little girly happy dance at my desk (I'm all elbows) and allowed myself to relax a little. Not only was Nathan cleaning the dishes themselves, but the surfaces in and around the sink. He was attempting to spray the bugs to death. I left him to it and kept browsing Reddit. I considered updating you guys at this point but not all of the roommates were back yet and I hadn't actually seen the finished product, so for all I knew he could have done a crap job.

I actually did end up checking the kitchen not long after this conversation (I wanted to make myself some tea anyway) and to my great pleasure, there were no dishes in the sink, and very few bugs. We're still basically in a cabin in the woods, so some little gnats and fruit flies are an unfortunate inevitability, but it was nowhere near the thriving community that it had been a few hours prior.

**Luciano,** the final roommate, got home around 8:00 at night, much later, in a wonderful mood. He's the party boy roommate, and he and Nathan are best buddies who often get drunk together. Our recycling bin is always full of beer cans and empty bottles of booze, and it's pretty much always because Luciano and Nathan stayed up late smoking cigarettes and drinking. So, Luciano gets back and starts unloading beers onto the counter. *Thunk, thunk.*

""Nathaaaaaaaaaaaaan! Nathan, come here you bastard, let's drink!""

Nathan had apparently been asleep, catching up from his jet lag, and stumbled out of his room. Two beer cans open.

>**Nathan:** Lou, you owe me like five beers. Did you make chicken last week?  
>  
>**Luciano:** Umm... probably. You want some? *(the fridge door opens)*  
>  
>**Nathan:** No dude, you didn't wash any of your shit. It was still sitting in the sink today when I got back.  
>  
>**Luciano:** *(awkward pause; the fridge closes)* Fuuuuuuuuuuck.  
>  
>**Nathan:** YEAH. Dude, look at this. *(I'm assuming Nathan took pictures of the sink when he got back and started showing them to Luciano)* This is what it looked like in here. Like, I know the baking sheet was mine from before, but...  
>  
>**Luciano:** Ahh, shit.

At this point Nathan started whispering a little bit so I couldn't really make it out (I'm sorry, guys!), but I'm fairly certain I heard my name in there, so I can only assume it was somewhere on the spectrum between a charitable ""We literally JUST told Witty she wouldn't have to do our dishes,"" and an angry ""Witty was a huge bitch about it and I had to clean everything."" Either way, whatever; I don't mind being the bad guy when I have a CLEAN SINK!

A few minutes ago, I popped out to the kitchen to make myself more tea. Everything looked good, thank baby Jesus. Luciano and Nathan were out on the back porch chain-smoking, and Sanjit is probably still out with his girlfriend. For the sake of it, I gave the kitchen another good hose-down with the insecticide and then wiped it down to dry. The kitchen definitely smells like bug spray right now but honestly I'll take it. Maybe the lingering smell will be a reminder.

I wish I could fast forward into the future here and tell you guys, ""And they never left dishes in the sink again. The end!"" but only time will tell on that front. It seems like the #1 culprit here was Luciano, and I'm a little sad that he didn't have to deal with the bugs face to face, but if big bro Nathan keeps him on track then we'll be fine.

I'm sure some of you were waiting for there to be a big blow-out roommate brawl, and to be honest part of me was prepared to get into an argument with someone over this, but I'm grateful that the shit just got done without there being too much of an interpersonal issue. I'm definitely going to keep your strategies in my back pocket for the future, so if this happens again, they'll either get dishes on their pillows or I'll hide all the clean dishes so they can't use them.

Thank you so much for reading my previous post and this follow-up, and for being so invested in the outcome here. Good luck in all of your maliciously compliant endeavors, and for God's sake, **WASH YOUR DISHES.**

I've literally been trying to find a cozy game like Life is Strange but there are specific reasons I love the game:

* Narrative - I love the storylines, the characters, and everything about it. I've been through all of the games already and sometimes I watch gameplays just to relive it because I love the story that much.
* Ambiance and artwork - the art, music, and overall feel of the game(s) are unmatched, truly.
* The limited action - I DO NOT like action games that much but the small amount of action that is in the life is strange games is perfect for me. I don't like games where you have to kill/fight a lot Tor there are zombies, robots, etc. (which is why I'm not a big fan of Detroit Become Human).

So I've been patiently waiting for the new Lost Records game to come out.  But in the meantime, I've already been through:

* Tell Me Why (not a huge fan of the story to be honest)
* Firewatch (wish it was longer)
* What Remains of Edith Finch (loved but I wish it was longer like LiS)
* Gone home (loved but wish it was longer too)
* Twin Mirror  (eh)
* Road 96 (was okay!)
* Night in The Woods (love but not a fan of the art)
* Oxenfree (amazing but also like I said I feel like something along the lines of LiS art would be nice)
* I Was a Teenage Exocolonist (Just no for me)

I know I'm super picky but I don't like farming games and stuff like the walking dead, detroit become human, or any other super gory/horror games. The reason I love life is strange is because it's cozy, and makes me honestly want to get a hot cup of coffee and just stay inside and play. I love the setting most of all, in a small town usually with a melancholy feel. If you know any games like this please let me know.",2,1737089849.0,videogames,3,1.0,False

My preferences - I am by and large a milk based drink person.

I currently have the Zerno on order but given the wait time, I have been looking at the EG-1 and Lagom 01. The reason I originally went with the Zerno was due to burr options and tinkering (auger options). The more I look at the EG-1 and 01 though, I think the workflow is more enjoyable.

(can be anything).,"I’ve got a couple of run in’s with players over the years, here’s a couple:

During early 2020 a couple of the GWS players came to our school to do a meet & greet/clinic thing. They came around signed stuff from jerseys, footy’s all that stuff, it was Jacob Hopper who is now at the tigers and Jye Caldwell who is now at the Bombers. This was when they were still quite young & at the Giants, really polite guys & got around everyone at the school which is great. My year group had 
PE the next period and it was our dancing program we did every year & it was compulsory to do it. Our teacher Quickly caught Hopper & Caldwell before they left & asked them to Join in for a bit, they were a bit hesitant but they said why not. So we had those two join in with the dancing which was like Heel & Toe, Macarena all that type of stuff which was pretty funny. All the girls in my year all frothed over them both you know getting to dance with these AFL players especially Jye Caldwell in particular.

A mate of mine ran into Bailey Smith at a George Kambosos Fight in mid 2022 at Marvel Stadium. My mate ran into him shook Smith’s hand, said Gday, looked him in the eyes and called him the Sexiest man on the planet. He just laughed apparently and walk off as he was in a rush to get to somewhere else. 

Seen Tom Papley in late 2023 at a Venue in Sydney absolutely Fried off his face. Been told by numerous people he’s loves a bag.

In Mid 2020 I was staying in Coogee in Sydney & the Hawks COVID Hub was located there for about a month. Met a handful of players including 3 time flag gun Jack Gunston who I met, got a photo with, super polite but was ordering a coffee so I didn’t bother him too much. The next day I walked past Randwick oval & seen Issac Smith, Liam Shiels, James Frawley and Ricky Henderson. I shouted out ""Carn the Hawks"" they all just waved & laughed back haha. 

Heard from a very good source who is relative of mine who is in radio still to this day told me that back like 5-6 years ago when Carlton Superstar Patty Cripps around 2018/19 when he was massively linked with a move back home to W.A, apparently he was really keen on getting back home, like really close but he obviously was too loyal to the Carlton footy club and look what he’s done from now till today: Dual Brownlow medalist, 4x All Australian, Carlton Skipper. Would love to see him lift up a cup soon! 

Was coming out of a lift in a Sydney Mall, think it was Bondi Junction maybe. Michael O’Loughlin (Micky O) the swans great walked out as me & my dad walked in. Dad said Gday & Micky O replied back saying Gday brother. He Shook dad’s hand and gave me a high five.

her symptoms started at 4 pm and she simply bled out and went to sleep before midnight yesterday. all that we know was she was bleeding vaginally (spayed) and the ultrasound showed abnormal thickening of her bladder. that’s all the diagnostics we could get since she was never able to be stabilized. we personally think she either had cancer or some sort of aneurysm. 

she looked like a dope till the end, trying to lift her head up to kiss us to tell us it was okay. i simply cannot fathom how she died so quickly, yet i am glad she didn’t suffer for any longer. 

we have another wolfhound, typhon, and our silly mix, aria, at home still. typhon was the older of the two at 5 years and i was more prepared to possibly have to say goodbye to HIM within the next two years, not little eddie. he now looks around very confused, howls and waits for her to respond, and waits for her on the porch to come in. aria is trying to just be jolly for our sakes, i think. i feel so bad for both of them, especially typhon since they loved and hated each other like true siblings.

Our relationship started back when I was 27 and he was 24, in May 2023. We met on Tinder and I originally just figured it would just be a coffee date and not much would grow from it. He and his ex broke up (of 3 years) about 6 months prior. I requested we take it slow in case he needed to heal some more. But, our relationship started off absolutely blissfully and we did a lot of traveling together. About 6 months later, he asked me to be his girlfriend. Literally the morning after, I found out I was pregnant. We decided on an abortion as I was in school and we weren't ready for a child yet. 

The night of the MA, I requested he would wake up with me once the meds kicked in, in case of any complications and for emotional support. I couldn't wake him up. I did it alone - and definitely felt it. From that moment on, the only thing I could explain is that I went through post-partum rage. Not only was this semester of school the most difficult I've done, I was also still reeling from the loss. I became verbally abusive, I'll be the first to admit. I started drinking to numb the emotions and the anger/abuse became so much worse. 

In May of 2024 I got SA'd at work by my manager/ex (very brief relationship). I felt so much guilt, but admitted it to him right away. It definitely soured the relationship. In late June, I called and requested a break because I was dealing with so much and needed some time to heal. He was crying and said that he saw me as his future wife. I did not want to keep treating him so poorly and started to seek therapy. Plus, I was getting ready to apply to my nursing program and needed to focus. Instead, he requested that it was a full on break up. I let it go for a month, and attempted to reconcile. 

Fast forward to October, I see him with a girl and my heart shattered. I still was very in love with him (still am). I reached out again and attempted to patch up the relationship. I asked if we could at least clear the air between us. I told him I would write a letter, but would prefer to meet in person. I waited a couple of weeks before I could get all my thoughts in order. Each week in November, he would reach out and ask where the letter is, until he finally decided we could meet for coffee. I shared my thoughts and my letter. He seemed to have been receptive to it. 2 weeks later, he asked me to dinner. He got my family some Slavic gifts (my family is Slavic) on his way home from Washington and gifted them after dinner. I ended up going back to his place and spending the night. I was also trying to start dating again at this point since he also was seeing people, but nothing serious from my end. In the morning, we woke up to a text from a guy I was seeing. The guy went through my phone while I was taking a nap and got my ex's number. He told my ex that I would kill myself if he didn't let me go. I have never said anything even remotely like that. My ex quickly blocked him and we went to breakfast. My ex said it would be best if we took a little time so I could figure out that situation. That guy became a stalker. Regardless, I gave my ex some space. My ex texted me during his Christmas vacation. Then comes New Years. He texted me and I told him to come over to be my NYE kiss. He apologized and said he couldn't, but didn't mean to be dismissive and to shoot him a text later. I was busy with the family party. He texted me multiple times, then ended up calling twice. I didn't see/hear it. On the third call, I finally picked up. We talked for 5 hours and it eventually led to sexting. It was looking like we were on the way back to each other. The next morning, he calls me and tells me, ""I think you should let me go."" I asked him why the sudden change. It was honestly a shock and I can barely remember the conversation. I asked him if this really was the choice he wanted to make and he said, ""I really don't know. But I'm seeing someone and that's going well."" I was blind-sided, especially since the sexual part of the relationship sparked back up. I asked him to please reconsider. He also said we will always have a bond, because of the loss, and that he still cares. He said it'd be nice to continue talking once in awhile to check in with each other. 

I let the situation simmer down, and I texted him earlier today asking for some clarification why he was talking to me through December and gave my family gifts and took me on a date. I didn't initiate conversations in December because of the stalker situation. No response. I tried calling twice. No response. 

I'm still desperately in love with the guy. I genuinely believe he is my person, but we have been handed some shit cards. I also admit that I became a horrendous partner through all the traumas I went through. I have sought help so I can improve myself. I don't understand why he would keep talking to me if he didn't even feel a sliver of emotions for me still. Now, all the healing I've done trying to realize we may never come back together over the previous months, came crashing down and I feel like we just broke up again. 

Can someone enlighten me... any ideas of what was going on in his mind? Any ideas of how to reconcile with him? To get him back? I don't want to be back burner, but right now, I'm willing to accept waiting a bit longer for him. 

TLDR - Ex and I broke up almost 7 months ago after multiple traumas. Tried to rekindle it in December, which seemed to be going well, until he decided against it early this month. How can I try to reconcile with him again? I really want him back.",1,1737089203.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I met this guy (26 year old male and I’m a 25 year old female) on tinder two years ago and we hit it off almost instantly. We talked maybe a month and then went on a date. date went good. We kissed. Next date I went to the fair with him and met his mom (he didn’t seem to think it was a big deal) we hung out basically once or twice a week after that for a month and hooked up the 5th time we hung out. 

I asked what he was looking for and he let me know he wasn’t in a place to be in a relationship yet, but he really enjoyed getting to know me and Felt like he had things to work on (to which I thought was bs but he did prove that to be true later) 
I told him I also had things to work on, but ultimately I’d like to find a relationship. So we both understood each other and kept hanging out. 

After new years we went to lunch and spent the day together with nothing romantic happening. When I got home I text him and asked what that was about. (We always kissed bye and stuff) he said 

“I think I see us as just friends and I’d like to still be in each others lives” I felt pretty upset and insecure and he told me “I find you attractive and like you I Just don’t think we’d work in a relationship” to which I said i understood cause that’s what I wanted. 

I stopped reaching out and he would send me stuff here and there. Fast forward to May he asked me to a movie and I felt like I was over him and that I’d be cool with that. So I went and it was good. We started spending time together again. Pretty much back to twice a week, he’d even come into my work and hangout when he’d get off early (I worked at a coffee shop) we never spoke about other relationships. 

He was getting ready to move and I was helping him pack up some clothes and kissed me. Like.. movie scene kissed me. We started hooking up again and spending a LOT of time together. We went to “dinner” and rarely called it dates but he usually paid and we’d dress up. I started sleeping over often and even met his family and he met mine. 

I condoned all of this because well.. he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship when he first met and then I made it in my head like maybe he was becoming ready. We had gotten so close on an emotional level. He’d tell me how much he loved spending time together. He’d take care of me when I was sick, he’d bring me food and we talked every single day. We ended up having a pregnancy scare and I thought he’d run for the hills, but he didn’t. A few months later he gave me a key to his place cause things at my place at the time were hard. The next night he held me in bed and told me he loved me after I cried about how bad a day I had. (He doesn’t say I love you very much and never to me, so it surprised me) 

We kept spending time together and then the end of February he told me he went on a date. He said he still didn’t want a relationship with anyone but it was nice getting to know her. I ended up letting my feelings get the best of me and read some of their text.. I blew up at him about what we were even doing. Because at this point he was one of my best friends who I did everything with and spent all my time with and in my head .. made love to and genuinely love.

He told me “I don’t want to say will never date because i can’t say my feelings won’t change but right now I don’t see us being in a relationship.. I thought the kissing and sex was just nice cause we both wanted it?” 

What about everything else? Am I crazy or was he treating me like we were in a relationship? I understand if it was just sex.. but now we have this weird friendship and I can’t unsee all that stuff that happened the past 2 years and just say it was him being my friend. He doesn’t tell me I’m crazy for thinking that he says on his end it just wasn’t that.. 
I feel like I’m going through a one sided break up and he doesn’t want me to not be in his life “it’s okay if we never kiss or hook up again. I just don’t want to lose you. I’m so sorry, I hurt you. I thought we were on the same page”  

Did he really think we were on the same page guys or did I just let him fool me? He’s one of my closest friends but it’s been hard seeing him go out with other people. any advice helps!

I started my “zero to hero” journey in the spring of 2022 when I took my EMT class at my local Community college. After finishing that and becoming an EMT in the summer of 2022, I chose to go straight into medic school in the fall because fuck it emts get paid like shit and I wanna be a firefighter and damn near every department in my state runs fire/als 911. 

I took my test yesterday and got stopped at the 110 minimum. (I left thinking I bombed it and was the most incompetent mf to ever take the test) I guess I proved I was entry level competent as quickly as possible lol. 

Anyways I wanna say I’m glad to have the license but I would really love some advice for a guy who is a medic and hasn’t even spent 1000 hours on an ambulance. I plan on applying to many fire departments and possibly a close by rural ems agency. If anyone else has gone zero to hero what was it like getting on the job for you?

And at this point, I really just think it’s me","It started so good in the beginning: new restaurant, fresh start. The chefs were making me elaborate food for free to try to win me over and joshing with me, the waitresses were having fun with me. Two waitresses had it out for me of course, and the ringleader slowly got everyone else on board. There was one chef who would tell them to include me in their little talks and would also get me coffee when the girls went on coffee runs. Now he doesn’t even look up when I come in. Joined the girls in their silent treatment/exclusion of me 

I know it’s because AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF OF NEWBIE HAZING I had *one day* where I was frustrated the girls where ganging up on me and he actually joined them in pointing out a mistake so I glared at him, ignored him the whole day, left without saying bye to him. And called out the next day. But that was one day out of 35! What am I a nun? I feel crushed. He was literally the only one that actually talked to me here and went out on a limb for me. 

Same thing at my old place, male manager would protect me against mean girl clique. Then one day he just straight up started ignoring me after I bruised his ego by just walking out without acknowledging him. By the time I quit he would not look up from his phone and literally looked the other way like I don’t exist for the majority of my time here, including when I’d say good morning or good night. Now this guy is doing the same.

I’ve tried so many times with these girls and the guy who was protecting me at both places, to the point of desperation. I was on my hands and knees scrubbing things I didn’t need to, to win back his approval and get his attention at my last restaurant. To no vail. I promised myself to never go that low and have to actively stop myself here from trying to get this second guy back. Even here I smile or thank them and all I get is being ignored or passive aggressive bullshit like being all up in my personal space or nitpicking or teaching me things I already know how to do

there’s just something fundamentally about my personality that causes people to just discard me after a certain point. Always. AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS! This is not about victim blaming myself etc. there’s genuinely something fucked up if I’m having the same patterns and dynamics at two completely different places.

I’ve looked it up and caffeine usually exasperates the irritability and heart palpitations. 

The first time I had vyvanse (40mg) I then had coffee and honestly felt like I was floating and it freaked me out a lot and caused a lot of anxiety and breathing issues. Since then I started from the bottom like 5mg and have worked up to 30mg over a few months. 

Is there anyone else who has this kind of floating reaction to mixing caffeine and Vyvanse? Headspins etc 

Is it a pretty harmless way to get a bit of a kick out of life or should I be more concerned. (I don’t smoke or literally anything bc it makes me full panic)

That was until we got given the Texas Instrument ones that could draw graphs and do semi complex algebra. It was a step change.

That same step change is kind of how I see going from a normal scale to something like the Varia Aku Pro scales. I've been getting by with a $32 Temu coffee scale for the past year and it was great, until it wasn't. Scales need to be reliable and over time, the Temu scale would freeze, resist a charge and get measurements wrong, quite wrong.

It may appear odd to cheap out on a set of scales when you own such a machine but in my mind a set of scales are arbitrary. If they are reliable and can measure weight plus time, happy days. Due to ""adult money"" and a hobby that demands plenty of it, I decided to go for the new kid on the block. These scales are not only comparatively inexpensive compared to the immediate competition, they also have a bunch of features that those scales don't. After using these for a bit, here's my list of likes and dislikes.

[Also a video of me using it for the first time.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE4avveyO3N/)

  
**Likes:**

* Colour screen. They could have done a bit more with it though such as a timer that starts green but goes red once it hits a pre-defined threshold like say 35 seconds. 
* Accuracy and auto tare. The 100g calibrated weight it comes with and auto tare/auto start functions work really well
* Aku Spro mode. I only make espresso so having this mode is neat. I actually find myself just looking at the time and ratio so I know when I've hit the 1:1.2 for my shot (flat white if you're wondering). 
* Waterproof-ness. It's all good to spill hot water all over this thing apparently. 



**Dis-likes:**

* The size. If it was Aku mini size but with the same screen it would be an absolute winner.
* Controls. Navigating the menu is annoying with two buttons. There are 6 modes and it takes ages to go from one mode to the next.

I wrote this post yesterday on my tumblr blog but some folx here on reddit wanted to see it too! TBH I kind of get the feeling that this is going to be more of a ""living"" document that gets edited as more information comes forth so, I just wanted to say up top that edits are going to happen and they will be clearly marked

.

I'm just going down a rabbit hole now, I guess?

I wanna start this off by saying, I don't think they're like... an evil company or anything. BUT I do think it's weird I was able to go on a hunt for how many smaller companies they own: if a former independent storefront (or storefront representing themselves as independent) is owned by a bigger company... I feel like that should be transparent to the consumer.

This is a post chronicling the connection of these different companies as well as what we kind of know about Jimmy Beans Wool.

**Who is ""Jimmy Beans Wool""?**

so ""['Jimmy' is me, Laura Zander, and together with my husband Doug, we opened Jimmy Beans Wool in 2002!](https://jimmybeanswool.com/pages/about-us)""

[""We're Jimmy Beans Wool and we're Reno, Nevada's Local Yarn Shop! Launched in 2002 by Laura and Doug Zander, JBW started with some coffee and a bit of yarn in Truckee, California. It's now grown into 3 businesses, a fun team of 35+ people, 20,000 square foot warehouse, and more!!""](https://jimmybeanswool.com/pages/meet-team-beans)

Poking around their website, they sell yarn, crafting accessories, classes, and host fiber arts related events both online and in their physical store. [According to this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/1h8wfe5/jimmy_beans_wool_revamped_their_website/) from about a month ago,which I cannot verify besides saying that as of January 15th 2025 they do not have Juniper Moon Farms yarn, their yarn selection has decreased since a website update in the recent past.

A point in favor of the company, their website links to both an ""inclusivity"" and ""Diversity"" statement on their Instagram account. The older one is from February 2019 (backtracking dates on instagram is hard because it goes by weeks) but my best estimate is that it was in response to the shooting of Laquan McDonald. I have attached a link to the Inclusivity statement [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt6QiqUggcM/) and the Diversity statement [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsvi1HSOH/). The Diversity statement backtracks to about late June/Early July 2019 when Jeffrey Epstein was arrested, 2020 election shenanigans brewing, and the sentencing of the guy who killed people in Charlottesville- unclear which of these events seems to have prompted them to make another statement emphasizing their stance.

Both statements pledge a commitment to ""doing better"" and preach the importance of uplifting BIPOC and other underrepresented groups and the comments section of the older post are WILD with people very angry that Jimmy Beans Wool is ""Woke"" now. While neither post makes measurable commitments (i.e. we will make sure X% of our patterns are from bipoc designers, or we will donate X amount to 'insert relevant charity here'), it's worth saying they did these *before* the George Floyd Protests (starting May 2020) when most companies started to make these kinds of statements. So they get a small kudos for that.

\[**1/16/2025 Edit:** a friend on tumblr told me that it's more likely the ""Diversity"" and ""Inclusivity"" posts were in response to public annoyance over JBW's company ""Namaste"". I didn't really get into JBW's ownership of Della Q, because that's an accessories brand and not a yarn brand, but Hey! JBW also owns Della Q. In a post on JBW's blog from October 2018- ""[Welcome to Namaste: Reincarnated. (now della Q!)Earlier this year I reached out to . . . Namaste, and asked if she was still interested in selling the business to us.](https://blog.jimmybeanswool.com/2018/10/welcome-to-namaste-reincarnated.html)"" If there was some public outcry about the name Namaste, I haven't seen it but also I haven't looked very hard. Hilariously, the internet is dead and after 2018, all the comments on the blog post appear to be from Bots with no charisma haha\]

The website for ""Simply Shetland"" which is the US distributor of ""Jamieson's of Shetland"" makes no reference to their ownership by Jimmy Beans Wool, and Jimmy Beans Wool doesn't mention they own ""Simply Shetland"", they merely say they distribute ""Jamieson's of Shetland"". However, the Simply Shetland Instagram post on their team from around December 2022 lists ""[Laura is our fearless leader and relentless advocate for yarn folks (like you 💓)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmPvJCZJl1c/)."" Interestingly, only the brand director Gudrun Johnston is tagged on the post. [Laura's own instagram only mentions her connection to ""Jimmy Beans Wool & Mad|Tosh"" in her bio](https://www.instagram.com/laurazander/).

""[\[Jimmy Beans Wool\] also launched Yarn Citizen, a sustainable brand that produces yarns from luxury and upcycled fibers at affordable prices.](https://voyagedallas.com/interview/meet-laura-zander-of-madelinetosh/)"" from a Voyage Dallas interview with Laura Zander. Curiously, the Yarn Citizen website merely says ""[Laura was touring fair trade mills across the region and admiring the female artisans as they sifted through mounds of recently sheared fiber.](https://www.yarncitizen.com/pages/our-story)"" and doesn't mention their connection to the Jimmy Beans Wool group. Yarn Citizen is, however, a featured brand (it's on the upper right corner) on their website along with della Q and MadelineTosh which they openly own.

Bizarrely, [the Shibui Knits website](https://shibuiknits.com/) has changed their front banner and most of the links from the drop down menu to being MadelineTosh branded... [but the ""About"" page still lists all the information of the former crew](https://shibuiknits.com/pages/about), doesn't mention Laura or Jimmy Beans Wool, and has a bunch of broken links. It appears that no yarns are being sold as ""Shibui Knits"" anymore, and they're all sold as MadelineTosh lines, as stated in the link earlier on this topic.

**What did we learn?**

Again, I don't really have a beef with this retailer, but it's kind of shocking that the ""family"" of yarn products isn't more widely advertised. I feel like the main reason I go to my local yarn store is to have access to yarns that can't really be produced on this kind of large scale: and to be fair, I'm also not of the mind that every skein of yarn at the store needs to be a precious hand dyed hanks.

But when I do pay a little bit more for yarn from an independent dyer, it's because I want to support a community of artists- even if they're not local to me. I realize that MadelineTosh and Dream In Color are still hand dyed yarns, but if I'm paying NEARLY $40 for a special project.... I kind of want that $40 to go to a smaller company where that means something.

Went to a cardiologist about a year ago who cleared me medically, said it was anxiety. I'm morbidly obese and have struggled with weight loss my whole life so naturally I assume my heart has just given up on me from carrying all this weight. Even with mounjaro and wegovy I'm still having a hard time losing weight. Last month I started going into long bigeminy episodes that feel like they last forever. This happens when I'm either sitting at my desk, trying to relax on the couch or trying to sleep. 

I either don't get them or don't feel them when I'm active and walking around. I'm trying so hard to lose weight and be more active but I'm always exhausted from these things keeping me up all night. I was just now drifting off when the bigeminy started again. I've quit coffee and I'm working on quitting the diet soda. I'm trying to see a cardiologist again in case things have changed. I had a week-long holter monitor and an ecg done last time. Holter showed occasional pvcs and pacs but the doctor wasn't concerned.

1i38dvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1i38dvi/my_story_vaping_and_heart_palpitations/,My Story: Vaping and Heart Palpitations,"I wanted to share my experience with vaping and heart palpitations to spread awareness, help others feel less alone, and contribute to discussions that might lead to better alternatives or treatments in the future.

I smoked cigarettes for about three years, but I was a light smoker, three cigarettes a day, sometimes just three a week. Looking for a ""healthier"" alternative, I made the switch to vaping. Honestly, I loved everything about it: the icy flavors, the nicotine buzz, and how it complemented my morning coffee while planning my day.

It felt like a stress-relief tool, helping me brainstorm, unwind, and smoke away my problems. But like most things that seem too good to be true, vaping had a dark side. For me, it wasn’t minor, it was heart palpitations.

.

About three months into vaping, I was puffing as usual when suddenly, it felt like my heart skipped a beat. For a split second, it was as if my heart stopped before jolting back to life. It was terrifying, I thought I might faint or even die.

I drank water, stopped vaping, and went to bed, hoping it was a one-off. But the next day, me being stupid my curiosity got the better of me. I convinced myself, *""Maybe it wasn’t the vape? Just take a few puffs and see.""* So, I did. Within an hour, the palpitations hit again.

That was the moment I quit vaping cold turkey. I loved it, sure, but not enough to risk my life for it.  
.

I visited multiple doctors, but every test came back normal. They told me my heart was perfectly healthy and pointed that this maybe happens because of anxiety or low blood pressure. But I knew that wasn’t it, I was in one of the happiest phases of my life, having just landed a new job and graduating college. I was positive, calm, and genuinely content. The only trigger was vaping.

I quit vaping, gave up caffeine, switched to a healthy diet, and walked an hour daily. Yet, the palpitations continued for months! I thought that vape triggered something and now it'll never go away, happening 1–3 times a day. Each time, it felt like my heart might stop for good. It was exhausting and scary.

One odd thing I discovered was that eating olives helped me feel better after a palpitation. I’d eat around 20 olives to calm down, though I have no idea why it worked.

After a full year of quitting vaping, the palpitations finally stopped. I was relieved and felt like I had my life back.

.

I stayed vape-free for another year. Then, about six months ago, life got overwhelming with work stress. I picked up cigarettes again (just one a day), and caffeine to cope, all felt good. But this month, I made the stupid mistake of returning to my ex, vaping. I convinced myself that what happened in the past was just a fluke, maybe unrelated to vaping. I lowered the nicotine and kept it to just a few puffs a day.

Within a month of vaping, the palpitations returned. That was it for me that can't be coincidence. I threw the vape away and decided to write this post to remind myself and warn others of the dangers.

.

So yes, vaping can cause heart palpitations and issues, even more so than cigarettes. The idea of vaping being ""healthier"" might just be another marketing scheme, like when they used to claim tobacco was safe.

We need to talk about this. We need to push for safer alternatives or better life coping solutions in the future. For now, vaping is not worth the risk. If you’re experiencing heart palpitations from vaping, you’re not alone, and I hope my story brings some comfort and clarity. Stay safe.",9,1737088137.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

She’s never available for touch bases because she’s apparently “so busy”. Things fall through the cracks and she expects the people on her team to do EVERYTHING. Sometimes she doesn’t come into the office at all and blames it on having a sick kid. It’s so fucking confusing how people like that end up in management. She leaves the team hanging on so many projects and expects us to just figure it out.

### **Chapter 9: Shadows of Diplomacy**     
     
Director Mariana Reyes’s office was a stark contrast to the grand halls of the **Intelligence Service Offices**. It was compact and utilitarian, its walls lined with shelves of files and monitors displaying live feeds from across the Crown’s intelligence network. The room hummed faintly with activity, but its atmosphere was calm, deliberate—a perfect reflection of the woman who commanded it.

General Márquez sat across from her, his posture as rigid as ever, though his sharp gaze betrayed a hint of curiosity. On the desk between them sat a steaming pot of coffee, untouched for now, as the two veterans of Puerto Rico’s shifting landscape sized each other up.

“You have a reputation, General,” Reyes began, her voice even.

Márquez raised an eyebrow. “Good or bad?”

“That depends,” Reyes replied with a faint smile. “You’re seen as a traditionalist, someone who values structure and stability. But some would say that makes you resistant to change.”

Márquez leaned back slightly, folding his arms. “Change for the sake of change is chaos, Director. Stability is what keeps nations standing.”

“And yet,” Reyes countered, “stagnation is what brings them to their knees. The balance, I think, lies somewhere in between.”


---

### **The Nature of Ambassadorship**

Reyes leaned forward, her fingers steepled. “I’ve been thinking a lot about ambassadorship lately—what it means, not just as a position, but as a philosophy. You’ve served in the military long enough to understand that diplomacy is often just another battlefield. But what do you think makes a great ambassador?”

Márquez considered the question carefully. “A great ambassador understands the stakes. They’re not just representing their nation’s interests—they’re navigating a web of relationships, each one with its own complexities. Strength, tact, and a clear sense of purpose are essential.”

Reyes nodded. “True. But I’d add something else: the ability to see beyond immediate interests. A great ambassador isn’t just negotiating for today—they’re building a foundation for tomorrow.”

Márquez’s expression darkened slightly. “That’s idealistic. Sometimes, tomorrow isn’t guaranteed. Sometimes, you fight for what you can get today.”


---

### **A Foreshadowed Future**

Reyes’s gaze sharpened. “Do you think that’s where we are now, General? Fighting for today?”

Márquez sighed. “I think we’re at a crossroads. The Crown is expanding its influence, but with that expansion comes risk. The alliances we’re building are fragile, and the enemies we’re making are waiting for their moment. The question isn’t whether we’ll face conflict—it’s whether we’ll be ready for it.”

Reyes nodded slowly. “That’s why ambassadorship is so critical. It’s not just about representing the Crown—it’s about shaping how we’re seen, how we’re understood. Perception can be as powerful as action.”

“And what happens when perception fails?” Márquez asked.

“Then you act,” Reyes said simply.


---

### **A Kingdom Beyond Borders**

The two fell silent for a moment, the weight of their conversation settling between them. Finally, Márquez broke the quiet.

“You’ve thought a lot about this,” he said.

Reyes smiled faintly. “It’s my job to think ahead, General. To see the threads before they’re woven into the fabric.”

“And what do you see?” Márquez asked.

Reyes’s expression turned contemplative. “I see a Puerto Rico that’s no longer defined by its borders. A nation that’s part of something larger—a network of relationships that extend across the stars. But I also see the dangers of that ambition. The more we reach, the more vulnerable we become.”

Márquez nodded. “Ambition always comes with a cost. The question is whether it’s worth paying.”

Reyes met his gaze. “It is, General. But only if we’re smart enough to anticipate the price—and strong enough to pay it.”


---

### **The End of the Beginning**

As the conversation wound down, Márquez rose from his chair, his movements deliberate.

“Thank you for the coffee, Director,” he said with a faint smirk, though neither had touched their cups.

Reyes stood as well, extending a hand. “Thank you for your perspective, General. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of each other in the days to come.”

Márquez shook her hand firmly. “I suspect you’re right. And for what it’s worth, I hope your vision of Puerto Rico comes true.”

Reyes smiled, though her eyes remained serious. “So do I, General. So do I.”

As Márquez left the office, Reyes returned to her desk, her gaze falling on the live feeds that flickered across the monitors. The threads of Puerto Rico’s future were weaving together, and she knew the tapestry they formed would be both beautiful and dangerous.

For now, the Crown held, but the game was far from over. And in the shadows of diplomacy, Mariana Reyes prepared for the battles yet to come.",1,1737087953.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

For weeks now, I’ve been fantasizing about hanging myself with a belt. I’ve tied it around my neck a few times, just to feel what it’s like. I’ve also been trying to push away these impulsive thoughts of cutting and even chopping off my hand at times.

Time is dragging, and everything feels hollow. My mind is foggy, my thoughts are slow, and nothing seems to feel good. Music sounds stale, food is bland, and even orgasms feel plain. I’m tired all the time, and coffee barely helps me stay awake. I’m bored out of my mind, stuck in this state where time moves painfully slow, and life feels dull to which its been getting worse day by day.

For years, I thought my depression was just this overwhelming negative energy this heavy sadness I couldn’t escape. But now after starting antipsychotics I’m starting to think what I experienced before might have been mixed episodes instead. Those felt more like negative energy that combines the energy of mania but instead of this euphoric high its more of this energetic sadness. What I’m feeling now is the complete opposite—it’s this hollow expanse of nothingness, quiet and heavy at the same time.

Tomorrow, I have a routine appointment with my psychiatrist, and I’ve decided I’m going to admit myself to the hospital after we talk. I’ve been admitted before for mania, but this is different, and I know I can’t handle it on my own.

I’m sharing this because I just need to tell someone because I feel so alone rn. I can't tell whether its the depression talking but I feel like everyone around me hates me and I just can't get it out of my mind. I did get chat gpt to help me summarize my thoughts because my energy is super low rn but I still wanted to post something (so sorry if it sounds a little odd), chatgpt has assisted me in getting this message out there.

In the first year of our relationship we had normal sex (no toys, porn, etc). On our second year we started opening ourselves up a little bit more. We started using toys, watching porn together every now and then, etc. He then started to get too comfortable I guess. He started saying he’d love to watch a man have sex with me which I don’t want to do, he brought up the idea of a threesome but I am way too territorial/jelous/ and most likely too insecure for that I could NEVER watch him have sex with anybody else. He still insists he wants to see someone have sex with me, I don’t want to. I feel like if I pleasure him in that aspect he’s just going to use it as an excuse to have sex with another woman because yes I have made it very clear that I would never feel comfortable letting him have sex with another woman. I’m honestly worried I’m not enough for him. Sometimes I don’t feel like I am, especially since he brought up the threesome idea (FFM)
I’ve honestly been feeling a bit insecure the last few months because I’ve caught him looking at porn, looking for xxx content in Snapchat, joining WhatsApp porn groups (people on there send sex tapes). He hasn’t done it since I caught him because I’ve found nothing since I guess. His horniness is taking a toll on my confidence. I don’t feel comfortable with him looking at other girls to pleasure himself, it was fun when we were doing it together but it made me feel some type of way when I caught it on his search history. Sometimes he’ll make “jokes” saying we should go to a strip club together. Today he made a joke as we drove by a bikini coffee and said we should get coffee there (we were driving to a Starbucks in that moment). I just said “no” and he laughed and said “why are you so insecure baby?” I find it disrespectful and disgusting. He’s changed so much I don’t feel like he’s the man I married. He used to be territorial/ jealous as well and it flattered me. Now he doesn’t even care, or never shows any jealousy even when there is motive too. Sometimes I get scared I won’t pleasure him enough and he’ll go cheat on me (we have no cheating history except the fact that when we had only been dating for 1 month he texted his ex behind my back and called her, she was the one that told me. He cried and begged I wouldn’t leave so I gave him another chance) , AIO? ",15,1737087944.0,Marriage,47,0.8,False

I’m going to be a first-year ASL interpreting student this fall and looking for a potential roommate(s). (Was thinking Peter Peterson Hall or any dorm with access to the tunnels).
I’m a trans guy, so if you’re uncomfortable sharing a living space with a queer person please don’t feel pressured to reply. I’m very chill and can/will mostly keep to myself, prefer a neat space but don’t mind the dorm being social or becoming a hangout spot. I am cool rooming with people of any orientation or identity. Also totally cool rooming with sophomores-seniors.

I’m into music, art, streetwear, and food/travel. I love experiencing new things and making friends. One of my favorite things to do with friends is go out for coffee and sightsee, and my favorite color is green.

My coffee order is a double shot espresso with oat milk and vanilla syrup.
My boba order is a thai tea with coffee jellies and caramel. 

LMK if you’re interested and I can give you my IG handle so we can chat a bit more!

I’m mainly putting this out here because while I don’t necessarily want to be on the “gender inclusive” floor, I’d like to have a roommate who can be respectful of me and vice versa. Also, I’ve never had to share a room with another teen/adult so I’d like to take the time to get to know somebody before applying for housing.

Jokes aside, I’m so proud of myself right now. This has been a year-long journey, but I really started taking it seriously about 8 months ago.

In January 2024, I began experimenting with my diet. I tried fasting (couldn’t stick with it—coffee was my kryptonite), gave the carnivore diet a shot for a few weeks (lost a ton of weight but knew it wasn’t sustainable), and eventually landed on a keto-style diet—low carbs, high protein.

After a few months, I saw some weight loss and decided it was time to incorporate fitness. I started with treadmill walks at the gym but didn’t do any consistent resistance training. Then, in June 2024, I made two commitments:

1. Get 10,000 steps a day—no excuses.
2. Track my food every single day.

I haven’t missed a single day since—not even when I was sick or injured. (Yes, I walked on an injured ankle one day. Probably not smart, but hey, commitment, right?)

Now, starting in 2025, I’ve added daily calisthenics as another “non-negotiable” part of my routine. Every day, I do:

* 40 push-ups
* 80 squats
* Stretching in the morning and before bed

My son got me a push-up board for Christmas, so I’ve been doing 10 of each variation daily. It’s a fun little addition to my routine!

I had a doctor’s appointment yesterday, and they mentioned we might start talking about coming off my meds in April! (Currently on blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and metformin for diabetes.) My A1C dropped below 6 and was 5.2 at my last blood work, which feels like a huge win.

Sorry for the brag post, but I’m just so proud of how far I’ve come. Wishing all of you the best of luck on your own weight loss and health journeys—you’ve got this!",65,1737087764.0,loseit,8,0.97,False

I hate myself. I hate the person I’ve become. I feel so guilty. I don’t know how to apologize because of how many times I’ve done things like this to her and other family members.",3,1737087502.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False
1i386sl,https://v.redd.it/drp54r8uchde1,"New Moka pot, first brew","I just moved out for college and had to say goodbye with the espresso setup my family had back home. Saw this in a department store on sale for 40% off and thought, why not give it a shot?

I grabbed some pre-ground coffee from the grocery store, watched a quick 4-minute James Hoffmann tutorial, and got right into brewing without overthinking it. But wow, I’m actually really excited about how it turned out. 

Extraction felt a little too quick so I'll try lowering the heat next time. Any tips on how I can maximize my brews? I'm probably gonna invest on a hand grinder later on and look around for some local roasters.

I (m23) got out of a 2 year relationship in August which destroyed my confidence in dating, and made me believe I was undesirable. I have since somewhat overcompensated by talking to, hooking up with, and ‘dating’ 4 different girls at the same time. I don’t want to be long term or serious with any of them, and neither do they as far as I can tell, but it’s getting difficult to manage all of the relationships at the same time. 
The first girl ‘E’ was a friend and classmate who I started hanging out with in October, and we have had a nice and casual FWB relationship since then. We both are dating around and seeing other people, but I’ve been spending a lot more time with her during this winter break cuz we both stayed in the town where we go to college. I like her, and enjoy talking and spending time with her, but she has some major red flags in her mental health that would prevent me from considering something long term. Sex is good and I really enjoy the casual nature of it but nothing mind blowing.
The second girl ‘C’, I met at a bar before finals week, hung out a few times and was very attracted to her but didn’t have enough time to really get to know her before she went back home for break. We had sex once and it was unbelievably incredible. I assumed that it was just a little fling because she never texted me back or stayed in contact when she went home, even though I would have liked to see her again. 
I met girl 3 ‘K’ through mutuals on new years, I had seen her around before and thought she was really cute but never really talked to her until NYE. We hooked up that night, and she was really inexperienced which made it hard for me to feel good but easy to make her feel good so there was a bit of a pleasure imbalance. I have been seeing and talking to her since then, gotten coffee, walks, bars etc. she’s really sweet, attractive, hard working, motivated, and grounded which I like. But she has terrible adhd to the point that following a conversation/ story with her is like trying to eat ramen with one chopstick. She also cuts me off a lot. Additionally she’s talks about me to her friends and co-workers a lot which is okay but considering I just met her, puts a lot of pressure on me which I don’t like. Also I am attracted to her but I don’t feel that deep feeling of yearning that I have gotten from other girls. I feel like I just want to be her friend, and I have explicitly tried to friendzone her twice, to which both times she has straight up told me ‘no’ and that she wants to keep seeing me. 
I met girl 4 ‘N’ at a bar 2 days after hooking up with K the first time. N insisted on coming home with me even without me asking or suggesting anything. We cuddled and hooked up in the morning after which she literally cried and trauma dumped about how she has never been treated so nicely by a man and how I’m the first guy she’s ever felt safe around. That day we just hung out, talked, and got food. She told me about all the terrible shit that has happened to her and how she’s never met anyone like me (I don’t think I’m special, I  just respect women, their boundaries, don’t talk down to them, listen, and show interest. Which was apparently all it took to blow her mind). I took her on a date to a nice restaurant and after she continued to trauma dump, told me that she adopted a 16yo who has 2 kids, and that she is actually a witch, can see fairies, converse with the dead, and that my aura was golden and baby blue. Then wrapped up the night by telling me she thinks she’s falling in love with me. I called her the next day and said I can’t keep seeing her, she sobbed and has been posting really cryptic stories and pictures of herself crying for the last 5 days. Also she has texted me 3 times telling me she wants to see me and that she misses me. I have not responded. 

During this whole escapade I have still been seeing and going on dates with both E (we are more like friends so not exactly dates) and K. I ran into K at the bar last night, tried to friendzone her, failed and she insisted on coming back to my place to have her brains railed out. I have been helping E move to a new house and she asked me to spend the night with her on the first night (tonight) so she feels safe. But a few hours ago C texted me out of the blue asking if I want to hang out tonight, after I’ve already made plans to see E. And now K just asked what I’m up to as I am writing this. I really want to see C because I feel the most heartstrings attraction to her, but I am friends with E and don’t want to be a dick/ a bad friend and I don’t know how to get rid of K because she is also a central person in a friend group I have just started to hang out with and I don’t want to piss he off and risk losing them after I lost all my friends in my last breakup.

I have seriously gotten myself way too deep into this and don’t know how to handle it please help. 

Also, I have gotten full panel tested multiple times and am clean so don’t rip on me for unsafe sex practices. 
Also also, E is aware and okay that I am seeing and talking to other girls as we have an open arrangement, but we don’t talk about all the details so she has no idea the extent. The others have no awareness of each others existence and I have been lying which feels awful. 

TLDR: I’m talking to too many girls, all of which have their own perks and downsides, don’t know which one if any I really want, and am getting stressed out by juggling all the relationships at the same time. 

What do I do next? End it with all of them and take a step back from dating for a min? Some of them? Who? How do I know? Is this messed up of me to be doing? Do I just say fuck it and wait for it to explode in my face? ",0,1737087419.0,offmychest,11,0.25,False
1i385m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i385m6/reaching_out_getting_back_with_your_first_love/,Reaching out / getting back with your first love years later,"
My ex and I got together when I was 18 and she was 19. We both went off to university, and dated for almost 3 years. We were doing long distance at different schools (only 3 hrs away so very doable at the time). With the onset of grad school for her and internships / coops for me, it seemed like we were going to end up in very different places and she ended up breaking up with me. I was devastated. I broke contact with her immediately because I knew I couldn’t handle speaking to her without being together. We’ve barely spoken since. I did a lot of reflection and healing for around 1.5 years and got to the point where I accepted it all, was content and felt no pain. She was my first and only real love and all relationships / dating in any capacity since her has not been the same. 

The one time I saw her (agreed to meet up and catch up 2 years post breakup), I was sent for a whirlwind of emotions. It was great to see her, we talked about our new lives and reflected on the last a bit too. The encounter was purely platonic, but I was a wreck for weeks afterwards. Afterwards, I felt nothing about it. But we didn’t speak anymore.

Now, I’ve graduated university and am working full time. I constantly find myself thinking about her more and more almost 3.5 years later. We’ve barely spoken, and I don’t even know if she’d be the same person today as who I remember and think of. I find myself thinking of the same future together as adults that I used to picture when we’re still in university.

I currently live on the opposite side of the country, but our family homes are in the same neighborhood and my work is flexible to allow to move around where I choose. I’ll be home in 3-4 months, and want to catch up with her over coffee, but don’t know how to tell her what’s been on my mind or if I even should.

Is it worth laying it all out there with her eventually? Is what I’m feeling still real or is it just being lonely with starting a new chapter of my life? Has anyone ever gotten back with a first love years later? If so, what was true for that happen? Any insight, thoughts or advice are appreciated.",1,1737087342.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

I used to get Kenyan beans from Starbucks and also try Blue Tokai beans but since Starbucks jacked up price to 1100/-, I am fully into BT. Vienna roast is the one I keep coming back to for its bold taste. This time, I had Bluetokai barista use Vienna roast beans I purchased to make cup of cappuccino. If you love bitterness, you must try Vienna roast. Good thing is that it is low on acidity. Another coffee that I liked is Roastery Coffee House in Hyderabad Banjara Hills. You get super fresh roasted beans there as the cafe is attached to roastery. You can actually see the huge roasting bins from cafe.",23,1737087341.0,IndiaCoffee,6,1.0,False
