I realize this is unreasonable but that has never stopped me before. I am looking for a warm, woody vanilla.

ChatGPT describes my preference as “sheer, airy, vanilla-orchid, ambroxan-lit, lifted with bergamot/pink pepper/etc” lol.

Basically light/sheer, not overly gourmand. The problem is I do not like the following notes:

\\- Tobacco/Smoke/Vetiver/Incense/Myrrh/Oud/Campfire/Resin/Cloves/Suede

\\- Bourbon/Rum/Whiskey/Cognac/Gin

\\- Basically All Fruity Notes (only tolerable ones: apple/bergamont/grapefruit)

\\- Patchouli (my nemesis), Coconut, Leather, Pine, Chocolate, Coffee, Tea

\\- Green notes/Earthy notes - grass/mossy/juniper/cassis/sage/fir/pine

\\- Overly floral

\\- Overly musky

LOVE: Vanilla Skin by Phlur, Cedar and Saffron by Salt & Stone, In Too Deep by 5 Sens.

DISLIKE (sadly): Gold, Fire at Will, Tihota, Happy Dust, Un Bois Vanille, Dama Bianca, Grand Soir, Gentle Fluidity Gold, Dream by the Maker, Sweet Surrender, Infusion de Vanille, Only Human by Noyz, Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere, Plush Vanilla, Aqua Allegoria Bosca, Dave, Dulce, Maison Tahite Vanilla2, Orchidee Vanille, Vanilla Vice, Vanilla Woods, Outremer Vanille, Frenshe Vanilla Cashmere

Just after midnight, dispatch sent me to a low-priority welfare check - front door open, no history at the address. Quiet neighborhood.

I arrived without lights or siren. Beige two-story house. Porch light on. Front door open about six inches. No damage. Screen door still closed.

I announced myself and went in.

Everything looked normal. Too normal. Couch straightened. Shoes lined up. No smell. No signs of a struggle.

The air felt warm, lived-in warm.

Kitchen light was on. Sink empty. One mug of coffee on the counter. Still warm when I touched it.

Dispatch tried the phone again. No answer.
I radioed that I was making entry and asked for backup, non-emergency. Cleared the first floor. Back door was locked - deadbolt and chain latched from the inside.

Upstairs, family photos on the wall. Recent. Kids. Bedrooms neat. One room had a phone charging on the nightstand - warm to the touch.

Bathroom light was on. Fan running. Steam fading on the mirror. No one inside.
I shut the fan off and just listened. Everything sounded normal, but the timing felt wrong.

I went back downstairs to wait.

That’s when the living room light went out.
I didn’t see the switch flip. The room just went dark.
I checked the lamp. Switch was off.

Backup arrived. We cleared the house again together. Same result. No people. No forced entry. Nothing that made sense.
We secured the front door, left a card, and cleared the call.
Before we left, my partner pointed at the kitchen counter.

There were two mugs now. Side by side. Both warm.

Neither of us said anything.

Years later, while reviewing old logs for something unrelated, I noticed an addendum added four minutes after we cleared.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Remember the days when we'd manually change prices on our online stores? Yeah, it feels like a lifetime ago, right? Fast forward to 2026, and sticking to those old ways is like waving goodbye to your profit margins and marketplace ranking. I mean, who has time for that?

A recent study by Gemius shows a whopping 67% of folks in Poland think price is a major factor in online shopping decisions. That means if you’re not keeping up with pricing trends, you might as well be selling VHS tapes.

Here’s the lowdown on why price automation is the game-changer you didn’t know you needed:

1. **Stay Competitive:** Automated repricing tools help you stay on top, adjusting your prices in real-time based on market trends.
2. **Save Time:** Let’s face it, manual updates are a time-sink. Automation frees up your days for more important stuff.
3. **Protect Margins:** Avoid the dreaded price wars and ensure you’re making bank, not breaking even.

For anyone looking into automating their pricing, there are some cool tools out there to consider. Base offers some nifty options to keep your pricing strategy sharp and hassle-free. It’s like having a teammate who’s always crunching numbers for you, without the office coffee runs.

""Open marriage"" often means ""my wife doesn't know."" I now verify. Trust but verify.

Everyone has baggage - it's HOW they carry it that matters. The guy who talks badly about his ex for an hour? Red flag. The guy who says ""it didn't work out, we're both happier now""? Green flag.

Coffee dates are your friend. I used to think dinner was more ""serious."" Now I know it's just more expensive when there's no chemistry.

The best dates happened when I stopped trying so hard. My current girlfriend said she liked that I seemed relaxed on our first date. I was relaxed because I'd genuinely stopped caring if it worked out. Paradox of dating in your 40s.

1qg2q47,https://www.reddit.com/r/10thDentist/comments/1qg2q47/as_a_straight_man_women_should_be_ones_doing_the/,"As a straight man, women should be ones doing the ""chasing"", not opposite","As a straight man, I love women, but I genuinely believe that women should be the ones ""chasing"" men, rather than the other way around. I believe gender roles in this regard should flip. There is simply nothing beneficial in chasing women; it does nothing but degrade men. I firmly believe men should not concern themselves with gaining a woman's approval; instead, women should care about OURS. Women should be the ones desiring men sexually and making the first move, while we should be ""extremely wary of accepting the deal."" Every time I have chased a woman or made the first move, I have felt holistically lowered and degraded in my soul, as if I were compromising my self-worth for someone who fundamentally hasn't earned that effort. (Except for Helen, which was GOATED girl, but imminently fell short). On the flip side, when I am simply doing my own thang and a woman shows interest in me, I feel validated. Consequently, I’ve stopped ""accepting deals"" and reciprocating by default. Looking back at my past relationships, both serious and ""fun"" none of their ""I do’s"" felt nearly as good as me saying, ""I don’t."" <3



This isn’t a slander against women, nor am I saying they are undeserving. Rather, I never want to put myself in a position where I am the ""desirer"" and they are the ""desiree."" To me, that position brings nothing but humiliation. I end up asking myself, ""What could she ever give me that I could not provide for myself?"" While some might say sex, I find the traditional view of sex to be inherently dominating, and I have no desire to dominate. I find it weak and wrong. I heavily condemn viewing a woman as a PURELY sex object; I would much rather be her friend while she desires more, allowing me to maintain my boundaries. There is no greater pleasure than not chasing sex and not attaching one's status as a man to sexual conquest. It is fundamentally compromising to desire women based solely on physical features. It is a sign of strength to be your own object of desire.



I believe the traditional dynamic is a farce. I refuse to chase because the act itself is a betrayal of self-worth. I’ve realized that the ""value"" women hold is largely a gift of my own imagination - a projection of depth onto an aesthetic that lacks it. Take Helen for example. I at some point realized that every personal quality I loved about her, I was better at (more honest, more empathetic, more integrity driven, more deep, more fair, more beautiful soul). When I myself am such a saint ass man, what quality does Helen retain that should keep my interest and desire? What's not already in me? 3, 2, 1 - vaggie. But why should I care about her vaggie anymore? It's not like vaggie is inherently desirable anymore once we establish that I'm a superior human being with a superior genitalia. Furthermore, Id even argue that most women are not inherently built for true emotional connection with men, simply because they lack the depth required for such a bond. They are simply ain't all that. In fact, when you strip away the social narratives and the ""emotional aspect"" of desire, the female form is not inherently superior to the male form. A woman’s aesthetic is only ""cute"" or desirable AS LONG AS a man projects onto her the very personal qualities that we have already established she most likely possesses not. It is both absurd and hilarious to realize that nearly 90% of a woman's social worth is tied to her visual desirability. This is a tragic state of affairs, made even more profound by the fact that this desirability does not originate from any genuine source within the woman herself. Instead, it is a product of a man’s own imaginative projection. Without the man’s willingness to bestow value upon her features, the ""magic"" of her physical presence goes bye bye. In this light, the act of chasing becomes even more nonsensical; the man is essentially chasing a value that he himself created and projected onto emptiness that asks you to pay for her coffee. In fact, even that is absurd, why should I be so degraded as to ""have to pay""? And no, she shouldn't either. I'm just saying that it's low to feel good about yourself because of muh ""see? Woman makes me pay, because I'm supposedly stronger"". Spoiler alert: it's all smoke and mirrors. You aren't any more stronger than her, it's just she plays this dumb ""be a man and stand up"" game. The boner you get from feeling needed that way isn't organic, nor deserved. It's just she doesn't know any better either not to ask you to prove to her what your manhood is about.



While I appreciate femininity and have had good times with women, I cannot see myself lowering my dignity to ask for sexual validation. I prefer a dynamic where she desires me and I hold the power to say no, or maybe even yes, but with the understanding that I am being ""charitable"" one, while she's this corrupted soul who fell for lust when she should have never fallen for that. In my ideal scenario, if I have sex with a woman, she understands that I am doing it for her benefit, and that I am perfectly content to return to my own life once it’s over. I refuse to compromise my sanity, dignity, and purity by craving something externally. While most men find comfort in, or even actively embrace, the gender roles and expectations women project onto them, I find them suffocating, disgusting, and utterly abhorrent. I refuse to let another human being dictate that I cannot show emotion or be vulnerable simply because they possess a ""vaggie."" Who are you, lady, to invalidate me for having a soul? The idea that I should reach an alexithymia-grade detachment from my own feelings just to earn your sexual favor is a ""deal"" I refuse to sign. Fuck off with that snake oil. I will never accept the premise that I am any more deserving of pain or should be any more stoic toward hurt than you are, simply because you’ve decided I should ""man up"" and shut the fuck up. What would I gain with that anyway? What's a return here? Vaggie? Yes, it's great, but I choose to stand above that. I am not trading my humanity for a transaction that was never equal to begin with.



I am well aware that this perspective will inevitably be labeled as ""sexist."" However, consider this: even if I were a sexist, most sexism in life doesn't actually stem from an innate desire to disrespect women. Rather, it arises from a deep, crushing disappointment. It is the result of envisioning women to be something infinitely better, only to realize how far they are lagging - in virtually every conceivable way - behind the ideal you once held for them. It isn't hatred; I LOVE WOMEN, I even saved this girl from getting sexually harassed by drunkard older men in a club, with me beating the shit outta 3 of them. It's the realization that the reality of the person will never catch up to the excellence of the projection. If this is sexism, then it is a sexism born of disappointment. It is the frustration of looking for a peer and finding only a mirror of my own projections, realizing that they are lagging infinitely behind the version of humanity I envisioned them to be. I don't want to dominate; I simply want to remain my own object of desire, refusing to compromise my dignity for a deal that was never worth the price. Women, I'm sorry that I am rejecting you, I know how it feels, trust me, it's just I have no malice doing this, no hard feelings here.



And finally, before the inevitable, lazy ""inb4 you’re just gay"" comments arrive, allow me to save you the breath. Haha, no. I feel absolutely zero sexual or romantic attraction to men. My orientation isn't the issue here. The reality is much more frustrating: I genuinely enjoy femininity and the female aesthetic, but I am continuously and repeatedly let down by the people who embody it. I appreciate the ""concept"" of the feminine, but the actual delivery is almost always a hollow disappointment that fails to live up to the standard I hold for myself. This is fundamentally about a refusal to lower my dignity for external validation, choosing instead a path of self-contained sovereignty.



And also, as a straight man, I want to respect women. But I get disappointed every time I see how fear-based their general modus operandi is. Sheer amount of times I have said something totally good faith and a woman has flipped my words to see bad for the sake of seeing bad is astonishing. Other day, I even told this McDonalds girl, ""hey, BTW, all of you McDonalds girls are very similar"", alluding to how they have ""cute, tiny, low height young girls"" (as opposed to lets say bossy). And guess what she said? ""You is being disrespectful now"". For what? You know for why? Because they deep down are full of insecurities and every compliment or neutral observation lands as demeaning to them. That's why I'm bashing male to female sexual desire. Men so repeatedly broke them into submissivity, they talk submissive by default now, and it's genuinely heartbreaking. Does constantly being seen as a monster sound fun to you? Good for you, I guess. Me? Nah, not my circus, not my monkeys.",5,1768723141.0,10thDentist,5,0.86,False

In short: 

 \- I can’t even boot the installer, unless I use -igfxvesa. I have tried many framebuffer ids, and more, but without -igfxvesa, the installer won’t even boot.

 \- with -igfxvesa, the installer boots, and installs. The installed macOS boots (with -igfxvesa), but fails (no dislay) without.

 \- I have managed to set up VNC, so I can now connect via an ethernet cable, and look at things on the computer running OpenCore (despite no actual display on the laptop). 

And the ?weird difference: 

 Firstly, booting with -igfxvesa shows a 31MB Intel UHD630 (as expected, as the laptop has a 4K screen, so 8-1=7, and (8x4)-7 = 31 - rather than the 7mb that people often get…

 But : booting without -igfxvesa, and connecting in via VNC, results in:

 \- ‘About My Mac’ not listing any graphics card at all!

My system is:

 \- Dell Precision 7540 ‘mobile workstation’ laptop, with 9th Gen i7 9850, 128gb RAM, and macOS on a Crucial 4TB NVmE SSD

 \- UHD630 iGPU, and nVidia Quadro R T X 3000 (with -wegnoegpu)

 \- working sound, ethernet, wifi (but I am only loading the IntelMausi kext for now)

 \- 2 monitors attached via the display port and the HDMI, just in case

 \- a MBP 2012 13” attached via VNC via Ethernet cable

 \- so I can now get into macOS despite no display (so I don’t need to use -igfxvesa any more)

 \- also, I am using a renamed Sample.plist, and followed the OpenCore guide; no automated stuff used!

 \- DebugEnhancer kext installed!

I have come some way, with some help from here :)

 \- initially I got a divide by zero kernel panic; fixed with stolenmem patches (maybe 64mb ones)?

 \- now I mainly get ‘no display’; it is actually the verbose text for 2 framebuffer IDs, and a black screen (with verbose text if I shine a torch at the screen) for the rest.

Booting into the system, and looking around, I can see:

 \- About This Mac doesn’t list graphics (not even an empty entry!)

 \- System Profile shows : a 1536MB UHD360 which supports Metal … but no displays are mentioned there

 \- from the system log, WhateverGreen does report that it patches the iGPU successfully (early-ish  in the boot sequence) but doesn’t do anything after that.

At this stage I am wondering:

 \- Is the iGPU driver even loading? The lack of mention of any video in About This Mac makes me think ‘not loading’, but it is listed in the System Report with 1536mb RAM, and Metal suppprt (which makes me think it is loaded?)

I am not sure how to proceed;

 \- if the driver is loaded (from the above), I will go through all the framebuffer IDs again, with the extra 2 monitors attached

I met my now husband on Tinder in 2021 & yeah, it wasn’t exactly a holy love story or my proudest moment. Shortly after, I decided that we should probably go our separate ways & dated a different guy for two or so years, who I had met in residency. Once a year, my now husband would message me out of the blue to ask for another date, promising he was a good guy. I declined the first two years, even going so far as to tell him, “Satan tries hard.” I was still convinced he was kind of a player. Then finally he caught me single that third year, and I agreed to a coffee/Bible study date. I wanted to sift him out. I didn’t though. I believed that he was different & changed: by the way he seemed to really know the Lord & the Word. A month later, I was his girlfriend. Within six months, I was his live-in fiancé; we wanted to take things slowly with his son, but my husband was also very ready to be married. We actually postponed because we were going to get married & move in all the same month. I moved in, but my SS was still getting used to the idea of me being married to his dad. My SS also had to process his mother coming back into his life after 5 years of absence, with her own fiancé he had never met either, that she would marry with my SS present, three months after she came back into his life. Within ten months, I became my husband’s wife, after a hushed wedding at my old church, just my pastor and his wife to witness. We felt convicted over living together, although we knew my SS wasn’t ready for the big celebration. So we waited til May of the next year for that, about five months after we really married. The whole time though, there were signs. I wasn’t perfect myself so I chose to have a little more grace with some things than I probably should have. I didn’t tell my then boyfriend that I had dated someone in the Bible study I introduced him to, and I had dated this other man three months and never kissed him. But it still bothered my husband he didn’t know before he met everyone, because they knew and he did not. Fair enough. I had some of those friends who asked me if we were truly equally yoked. I started to see my friends less. There were certain people I stopped texting. I stopped working out. I felt isolated. I couldn’t go do my ministry of helping people heal from trauma (family in prison over here so add that to my own stuff) without my then fiancé accusing me of cheating, or him noticing I was wearing a certain color underwear and how it was a trigger for him, and so on. So then there were certain things l could not wear. It was a class in a church building with many people gathered, but it meant I couldn’t constantly be in touch with him, so it really made him anxious. I usually had to keep my location on, send him snapchats of where I was, and occasionally I would FaceTime him to prove nobody was in the room I was supposed to be in alone. Anyways, we had both lied to each other in different small ways, but he waited to tell me until we were engaged that he was addicted to something. I had already told my family and friends we were engaged; we were on a trip with my family in a cabin when he told me, with his son there, too. At first, I reacted with what I thought was grace and truth. I said “we are going to fix this. This is not okay because it sounds like it could be dangerous long term for you, but we will fix this. I still love you.” The trouble with this is that the reason his sons mother was not involved for a long time was that she herself struggled with drug addiction & so had he. But because this thing he was doing was so inconspicuous he was able to tell me he was taking vitamins every morning, when they weren’t, and he was never quite feeling high, he thought it was okay. I later found out his parents were aware he did that stuff, but didn’t know I didn’t know right away, supposedly. Later down the road, a month before we were to be married publicly, there was a physical altercation that involved drunkenness & my toe being injured permanently (I never went to the doctor, but it still aches to this day, when bending down and putting pressure on it or if I am getting a pedicure and they rub my feet- how small and first world a problem, but still as a nurse, this small thing is my treat, but now, it’s a reminder, just for a few seconds). The same month my family member was sentenced to most of life in prison because they would be in their 70s when they got out. Well I recently went to confess sin to some friends who were at our wedding. One of these friends gave me a dream that another guest at our wedding had, that month before our ceremony. He was given the dream because he was in it- and the dreamer was unclear if that meant that he had some involvement. My husband was talking to him in this dream, after some graphic things occurred at our wedding that were hard to watch. The dreamer could not hear their conversation. Then I reunited joyfully with my husband & the image of a single sperm appears. We did miscarry this past September, and that was altogether an unplanned pregnancy, which was a roller coaster of emotions. My husband knows about the dream because he has since spoken with our friend himself. I am having a difficult time reconciling the joyful reuniting, especially the joyful part. I have honestly been one foot out the door for a while & my husband has changed a lot of things since that time. I have been bitter at heart & my mouth has spewed some awful things, I admit. There are still some things that have not changed or make me concerned, like finding porn on his phone, or coworkers who seem too close for comfort via text, and just times when I needed support through the miscarriage that I felt he was hyper focused on work or his cell phone. In fairness, I had told him I did not want a baby with him anyways, and that I had prayed God would deliver me from that because I was going to have the baby if he made me. Idk, I’m just deeply lost. Yes, we’ve seen a marriage counselor. Yes, I have had individual counseling. Yes, I have sought wise counsel. Yes, so has he. He confessed this physical altercation stuff to his pastor who married us in May, and to his parents. But the drug stuff, has definitely stayed hidden as hidden can be. It is the one thing I have tried not to talk about much with anyone at all because I know it could have an effect on his son, and that he is deeply concerned over it being found out. He has apologized & says he knows that was a big lie & needs to change, but a lot of these changes recently seem to stem from me telling him I figured out I could financially afford to invest in a separate space to live if I needed to. I am not afraid of this man hitting me. Yes, what he did was traumatizing, but I do believe he was drunk and angry. What I cannot understand is how since that time, he has not been much more sensitive to things in general, like if I need support during a miscarriage, besides him showing up to appointments or if I maybe needed a hug every now and again and sex to feel closer to him. I didn’t respect him, so he didn’t want to give me these things. I admit, I agreed to marry him publicly, but I did feel very much ready to say to heck with this at the time. Idk why exactly I went through with it except that I thought it was Christlike & we were already married with a child involved. But I did make his life quite rough after because I was contentious & just bitter. I want to be rid of that, but part of me feels like if I don’t leave him at least for a while, I am doing myself a disservice. I have already lived through childhood abuse, my family member going to prison, and then this. I have been leaning into God, truly. I just don’t know what to think of this dream & pray He confirms it is from him & He sends me someone to interpret if it means something other than an acknowledgment of my pain in getting married to this man.",1,1768722377.0,ChristianMarriageHelp,0,1.0,False
1qg2i88,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnon/comments/1qg2i88/motion_is_not_momentum_realpolitik_and_navigating/,Motion Is Not Momentum: Realpolitik and Navigating Class Contradictions,"Everything that happens in Minneapolis will be extended to the rest of the nation. Minneapolis is the state selected to be the test bed for ICE's war on the working class.

We, as revolutionaries, should probably be in our communities preparing for these things: building our resources, reinforcing our networks, identifying bad faith actors, doing mutual aid, and knowing that the army of the regime is coming to take our neighbors. There are people in your community who are already actively against the status quo of armed terror in our streets.

These are things you cannot do if you are alienated from your community, yet we are tasked with standing up in this moment. This requires us to maintain an understanding of the contradictions we are navigating, to reduce egoism, and to use realpolitik (politics based on practical praxis rather than ideological purity) finesse to build and maintain dual power and cultural counter-hegemony within our local spheres.

If people who stand against this madness are loud and apply pressure, those who have no problems with it, or even support it, will have to be quieter about it. But the rightoids aren't the smartest people. They have this policy of ""hiding their power level,"" wherein they know that their politics, beliefs, morals, and bigotry are morally unacceptable to others. In order to gain social power, they hide these beliefs and wear a mask. This is why they use dog whistles and wait until you're alone with them to show you their true colors.

The reality is, there are probably people within your community who are not allies but are hiding their power level. I've seen this in real time. Right-wingers are, for better or worse, actual understanders of how power moves: becoming indispensable, ""irreplaceable,"" knowing people with social power, having monied connections, and doing things for people in order to ingratiate themselves to the community. Combine this with the dog whistles and 'back-alley' conversations, and those who discover that this person is indeed a bad faith actor will be met with, ""He does such good work, there's no way!"" or ""He's too nice to be a racist,"" or ""We need him because no one else is willing to do X."" This logic allows the reactionary to test boundaries, recruit, and signal to allies while maintaining deniability within the larger, still-liberal hegemonic field.

Not to mention, rightoids will constantly use excuses like ""hearing out both sides,"" ""it's just dark humor,"" or ""I just liked it ironically"" to run fade for their beliefs and create more plausible deniability. They know that the majority of people are non-confrontational and do not want to create friction, because friction is bad for business. And then ICE shows up to abduct your food vendors at the show because the sound guy called them, and no one is going to know he called. No one is going to think that person was able to get that deep into a leftist circle.

And then, even if he's discovered, even if he's found out, retaliation becomes an issue. Especially if the person in question did have considerable social power within the community, they will feel wronged and perhaps ""betrayed"" for their beliefs. Will he call ICE and burn the whole spot? He loves guns and thinks the space is full of ""black and brown savages"" (the memes they engaged with said these exact things). Who's to say he's not a threat, especially given the racial biases of the justice system and how emboldened rightoids are with soldiers literally enacting their ""day of the rope"" dream on everyday people right now?

If the goal is to create a safe, or better yet, resilient community and community space, then this fear can very well have a chilling effect. The person who's worried about their safety due to their citizenship might feel even more threatened by the potential to be caught in the crosshairs of retaliation.

That's why, in theory, you have to have a zero tolerance policy for bigotry: for liking racist memes, for ironically posting shit about George Floyd, for making transphobic jokes, for engaging with right-wing content online. That's one of the easiest tells, because again, right-wing people are not that smart. Yeah, he follows five dozen white power accounts on IG, and people are seeing the memes he likes in their own feed because that's how IG works. They have poor opsec. When you start asking people in private, you learn, ""He's showed me racist memes when we were alone,"" or ""Yeah, we got into a debate about abortion and he got pretty heated about men's rights,"" or whatever the tell is.

Even still, the ""he's just into dark humor"" excuse has a lot of staying power; people do not want to believe people they place trust in are bigots. Furthermore, how does one distinguish between the necessary exclusion of a dangerous actor and the descent into sectarian purity spirals? How can community be built when there's limited room for growth and a purge-like logic is cast upon those who might engage in ""wrongthink""?

Ironically, here, the 'business sense' created by the contradictions of a small business owner's position can be of use. The higher tolerance for ideological differences predicated by the need to maintain customers forces a longer-term sense of thinking, allowing those in that position to gauge the severity of risk with the person involved. There's a strong difference between someone who watches Fox News with their headphones on while sipping coffee in the cafe, and someone who is actively in a position to harm the community. Essentially, there's levels to this shit, and it would behoove you to understand this dialectically.

Most of our community in the US is based on small business locations: cafes, coffee shops, bars, venues, etc. This isn't a moral judgment; this is a material reality of our material conditions. There's a need to not create friction within these spaces due to the need to maintain customer base and profits. Ergo, there's a strong likelihood that these spaces will tolerate the right-winger who remains quiet about it longer than they will tolerate the revolutionary who is loud about having zero tolerance.

Just because you are trusted by members of the community doesn't mean you have power within that community to the degree where you can unilaterally make tactical decisions that create significant friction within the business that the community uses. Especially when you consider that the class position of the small business owner is often much closer to the position of the worker than it is to the banker/landlord class, often working shifts right alongside the workers. Even if they have the capacity to fire or exploit the workers, the levels of exploitation will vary.

Yes, there are small business tyrants that abuse their workers, use churn tactics, and pay minimum wage; these do deserve scorn. Yet there is a minority of business owners who, despite being beholden to the exploitation inherent within the capitalist superstructure, are using their position within said superstructure to provide infrastructure that is inherently praxis-oriented. Being a resilient space within a sea of reactionary oppression is praxis in its own right. Taking the same wage as your worker is a form of solidarity.

We exist within late-stage capitalist neoliberalism wherein the entire model has been individual business ownership as the primary source of strengthening your own material conditions. One way we can look at this is: one group seeks to become the multi-millionaire exploiter, to join the capitalist class; the other group seeks to, as Deng put it, ""build our productive forces."" We cannot build revolution if we have no place to organize, and our superstructural constraints—the material conditions within America—dictate that the bulk of these spaces will be small businesses. Perhaps a significant portion of the material resources will come from this same minority of principally aligned petit-bourgeoisie. This was true for the IRA, after all.

The revolutionary must engage these contradictions dialectically, not dismiss them dogmatically. It's the revolutionary who is tasked with threading the contradictions between the capitalist superstructure that requires the community to use a business space, the need for the business to maintain profits, and the ideological allyship of the small business owner in relation to the class conflict with the business owner. This means that even if the small business owner is operating on the same principled line of zero tolerance, community safety, mutual aid, and queer protection, they are still beholden to the contradictions created by the superstructure. They have to maintain some level of profit because the rent has to be paid; it's really that simple sometimes.

The revolutionary, the activist, the organizer, is not beholden to the same contradictions created by this class position, which enables a higher degree of personal risk. But this personal risk cannot translate to the rest of those who are ideologically aligned with the revolutionary. Someone who has two kids to feed is going to inherently move differently than someone who has no children. Someone who started a business to create infrastructure for the community has no choice but to navigate those class contradictions, but those contradictions do not inherently prevent their allyship based on principles.

Realpolitik means understanding these different positions within the class structure and forming alliances based on a clear-eyed assessment of these constraints, not on ideological purity. You must understand this.

As I've learned, maintaining an internet presence and being a known person creates its own set of superstructural contradictions. Protester logic and purity culture create an air of inability in terms of real network building. Are you confusing militancy for martyrdom?

For example: You, as a trusted member of your community, learn that another member of the community is living in moldy conditions with children. You tell this person you'll do whatever you can, and you mean it. Again, militancy or rashness? Because you quickly learn that the landlord also owns a small business downtown. Before the community member who's a lawyer can even walk the person through all of the legal options available to them, you're making Instagram posts, tagging the business, mobilizing people for a potential action. All of this doesn't come to pass because the mold gets fixed. Pyrrhic victory? Yes, the mold issue is resolved; a working-class woman and her kids are sleeping safer. But you've just burned bridges with people who have considerable 'social clout' within the larger local power structure.

Other comrades tell you exactly the truth: There are people in the community who could have fixed the moldy drywall without ever involving the landlord. There are people within the community who can speak to the landlord one-on-one without ever making a public call-out, and there are people who can provide legal support for the renter to help them get their rent back. One might immediately jump to the ""fuck landlords"" bit, or even claim that the class contradictions here are too great, and thus only the most complete ""razing of the ground"" is an acceptable tactic. That's the dogmatic thinking, and in a sense, egoism, that prevents long-term praxis from fermenting. Is your goal to build dual power, or to win a single victory? There is a fundamental difference between the revolutionary and the activist in this sense, even if so much of our political messaging confuses activism for revolutionary action; you cannot make the same mistake.

As I've learned, if you want to protect your community, you have to be able to manage the friction you're going to create within that community. For example: You know that at least one person in a position of power within the space is engaging in the type of content I mentioned above, and you have people who are coming to you, telling you that this makes them uncomfortable, or perhaps even unsafe due to their citizenship status. You're being told this because you're a trusted person within the community who knows the stakes in a real way. Another person in the community with no social power or clout is also found posting racist memes, maybe posted up online in a racist shirt. Again, someone else in the community brings this to you because you're trusted and treat the space like it's your own. But perhaps that is the issue, no one can ""own"" a community, irregardless of principle, trust, or class position. This is the egoism in play.

You decide to use your social capital within the community to call out this person loudly at an event, with the intent of using this person as an example to showcase the zero tolerance principles. A reasonable strategy? Maybe, maybe not. If you burn your social capital in an explosive move, you could find yourself alienated from the community you intended to protect. The mutual aid infrastructure is more important than winning a single confrontation. Every action must be weighed against its impact on that capacity. Every action must be weighed between the potential for actual material praxis, and the potential to fuel the very egoism that can destroy that which you seek to build.

The friction created by this call-out, especially at an event, alienates the customer base of the business that the community (and its pantry, and other mutual aid related projects) rely on. Think of it like a video game meter; the meter gets too high, you fail the mission. Even if the call-out works, perhaps damaging the reputation of the person in question or causing others to rally against their beliefs, there will be others who are alienated by the directness. Those people might also be people of considerably higher standing within the community, who might feel that this sort of escalation of tactics in the short term damages the long-term stability of the infrastructure that is, again, needed to maintain essential mutual aid work.

Ergo, the revolutionary needs to operate with more finesse. Realpolitik is the most challenging of politics. It is, as Gramsci put it, a war of position, not of maneuver.

1qg2i20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qg2i20/how_to_build_habits_that_survive_stress_and/,How to build habits that survive stress and laziness stuff that actually works long term,"Every January we all become productivity gods. Gym memberships skyrocket. New planners sell out. But by February, most of it’s gone. This isn’t a lack of motivation. It’s a systems problem. And honestly, most advice online about just being disciplined is garbage. Especially on TikTok and IG where influences preach cold showers and 5 AM wake ups like it's crack.

The truth is nearly everyone around me including high achievers struggles to stick with habits when life gets even *slightly* chaotic. But stress, fatigue, and laziness don’t have to kill your goals. The way your daily systems are built determines whether your habits survive or collapse. Here’s what actually works based on research books and real psychology.

All tips below come from vetted sources *Atomic Habits* by James Clear the *Huberman Lab Podcast* psychology research from Stanford and Cambridge plus behavior design experts like BJ Fogg.

* **Make habits stupidly easy in the beginning**
   * *James Clear* calls this the Two Minute Rule start with a version of your habit that takes under 2 minutes. This rewires your brain to associate the habit with low effort.
      * Instead of Read 30 pages daily go with Open the book and read one sentence.
      * Sounds silly but it builds identity, not just action. Once you do that, most days, you'll do more than 2 minutes anyway.
   * *Stanford professor BJ Fogg* author of *Tiny Habits* emphasizes emotion over intensity. Feeling successful daily even with a tiny version creates habit momentum. Guilt and failure do the opposite.
* **Never rely on motivation. Design your environment**
   * Motivation is fragile. Systems are antifragile.
      * *Behavioral scientist* [Katy Milkman](https://www.katymilkman.com/) found in her temptation bundling research published in *Management Science* that pairing a habit with a guilty pleasure increases consistency. Example: Only let yourself watch Netflix while on the treadmill.
   * Your environment should make the right choice the easy one.
      * Put your vitamins next to your coffee mug. Lay out your gym clothes the night before. Delete apps that waste time.
* **Use friction to make bad habits annoying**
   * Research from Duke University shows we perform 45% of our behaviors out of habit, not decision. So add friction to bad ones.
      * Want to stop mindless scrolling? Log out of Instagram. Move it off your home screen. Add a 5 digit password.
      * Want to save money? Put your debit card in a drawer and use cash envelopes.
* **Habit stacking: Use existing routines as anchors**
   * Your brain craves predictability. [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) talks about context driven behavior on his podcast. One way to lock in habits is to build them onto something you already do.
      * After brushing teeth → meditate for 1 minute
      * After making morning coffee → write down 3 things you’re grateful for
* **Track streaks, not perfection**
   * *Brad Stulberg* in his book *The Practice of Groundedness* emphasizes consistency over intensity. Habits don’t need you to be on fire just not quitting.
      * Use a habit tracker app or even a paper calendar. When you break a chain don’t miss two days in a row. That’s it. That’s the game.
      * Missing one day is a blip. Two becomes a pattern. This is backed by research from the *European Journal of Social Psychology* they found it takes an average of 66 days to solidify a habit not a strict 21 or 30
* **Have a minimum viable fallback for bad days**
   * Life will get messy. Busy work weeks, illness, breakups, boredom. You need a downgraded version of your habit ready to go.
      * Too sick to work out? Do 5 pushups or just stretch for 2 minutes.
      * Too tired to journal? Just write one sentence.
   * This keeps the **identity loop** intact I'm still someone who works out or I'm still someone who reflects daily.
* **Be obsessed with identity, not outcome**
   * Research from *Cambridge University’s Department of Psychology* shows that identity based habits I am a reader vs I want to read 20 books have a higher long term success rate.
      * Every time you show up, even for a few minutes, you cast a vote for your new identity.
      * Outcomes are fragile. Identity is sticky.
* **Use  If Then Planning before stress hits**
   * This technique, known as implementation intentions by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, is powerful under stress and laziness.
      * Example If I feel too tired when I get home *then* I’ll do a 7 minute YouTube yoga instead of the gym.
      * It’s a pre loaded script your brain runs when it gets overwhelmed.

Habit-building isn’t about being hyper disciplined. It’s about being smarter than your future self who’s tired, stressed and low energy. Optimize for real life chaos not ideal circumstances. Most people fail because their habits are only built for good days.

1qg2a5j,https://i.redd.it/8ma1jbk492eg1.png,Contracted to the Billionaire,"Chapter 1

In the year we’ve been married, Julian Sterling’s first love has come to see me three times.  
  
The first time, she was just curious—wondering how a girl from Brooklyn like me was worthy of the Sterling family ring.  
  
The second time, she stood in my penthouse apartment, looked around, and told me Julian had originally prepared all of this for her.  
  
The third time, she threw an ultrasound picture at me, suggesting I stop overstaying my welcome.  
  
I kept a polite smile and shrugged. “Monica, this marriage—whether we divorce, when we divorce—that’s his call. I just agreed to his terms.”  
  
“Go find him if you want. If he agrees to a divorce, my lawyer is on standby.”  
  
…  
  
The video of Julian proposing to Monica Vane once went viral across all social media.  
  
One was the sole heir to the Vanguard Group, a prince from an old-money New York family. The other was Hollywood’s reigning sweetheart.  
  
It was the American dream.  
  
But in Mrs. Sterling’s eyes, a Hollywood actress was just a slightly more glamorous socialite, not fit for their family.  
  
The old woman used all her resources to break them up. Back then, 25-year-old Julian hadn’t fully taken control of the company, and 24-year-old Monica was gunning for an Oscar.  
  
Reality is cruel. The golden couple eventually announced to the world that they had “amicably split due to work conflicts.”  
  
Julian was filled with a rage he couldn’t unleash.  
  
So he turned around and married someone even less “presentable”—me, Harper Quinn, an illegitimate daughter who was practically invisible to my own family.  
  
I understood his logic.  
  
He wanted to give Monica a wedding of the century, to have their union blessed by all of Manhattan's high society. To do that, he needed his family's approval.  
  
But I was different.  
  
All he had to do was take me to City Hall. That act alone was the loudest slap in the face to his mother and his family. No grand party, no Vogue photoshoot. The fewer people who knew, the better.  
  
If I’m not mistaken, the only two people who truly knew were us.  
  
We got our marriage license like we were ordering coffee at Starbucks. No lines, just a signature. No drama.  
  
Afterward, Julian dragged me straight to the family estate on Long Island and stood before his mother. The smile on his face was both defiant and dripping with sarcasm.  
  
“Mother, I’d like you to meet Harper Quinn. My wife.”  
  
“Don’t look down on her background—almost 25 and never even had a serious boyfriend. She’s simple and has a clean record.”  
  
“This time, you must be satisfied, right?”  
  
His mother was so furious she shattered her favorite English bone china teacup.  
  
But Julian just handed copies of our marriage certificate to the butler and the maids. No one dared to take it, so he held it up to their faces, one by one.  
  
Finally, he came back to my side, slung his arm around my shoulder, and we walked out of that suffocating mansion, laughing.  
  
He laughed with wild abandon.  
  
By night, he had transformed into a melancholy prince, drinking whiskey alone on the terrace of his TriBeCa penthouse, gazing at the Manhattan skyline. His lonely silhouette looked like a tragic hero from a movie.  
  
The late autumn air in New York was a bit chilly.  
  
Remembering the ridiculously large check he had transferred to me that day, I felt a professional obligation to bring him a cashmere blanket.  
  
As I turned to leave, he grabbed my hand.  
  
I let him pull me down onto the outdoor sofa next to him. The lights along the Hudson River were a dazzling, dreamlike spectacle. Beautiful, yes, but also freezing.  
  
I’ve always known how to take care of myself.  
  
I unfolded the cashmere blanket, wrapped half of it around myself, and draped the other half over Julian.  
  
As I settled back, he turned his head to look at me. His deep eyes held a suppressed, wet ferocity. It didn't feel threatening; instead, he looked like a big golden retriever caught in the rain, a little pitiful.  
  
I bit back a smile.  
  
But he caught my chin.  
  
“Harper, you’re my woman now. You have to be on my side. Don't listen to what anyone else says.”  
  
“Okay,” I nodded.  
  
Then he added, “Whether we get divorced, when we get divorced—that’s my call.”  
  
I was a little confused. “You mean, when you get tired of me?”  
  
Julian frowned. “No. It’s when I don’t need you anymore.”  
  
I didn’t bother arguing the difference. I just smiled. “Okay. Deal.”

1qg28zz,https://i.redd.it/9m3uf13842eg1.jpeg,1/4 lb chickpea peanut butter cups (370 cal),"Guys I'm not gonna lie to you, it's like the chickpea cookie dough; it's better than you expect for chickpeas, but no human being is gonna mistake it for the real thing. Posting because this is as close as I could get to the real thing and I think someone out here can do better and I'd love to see how they do it. I'm passing the baton, as it were. 

Recipe  
(makes 6 4 oz cups) 

1 15oz can chickpeas  
1 ts vanilla extract   
1/2 ts butter extract (you may be able to omit this and not notice, I think it counteracts the chickpea flavor)   
1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk   
1/4 cup natural crunchy peanut butter (smooth would work, I wanted a bit of texture)  
1 cup granulated 0 cal sweetener (I used Stevia)   
1/2 cup powdered peanuts (I used PB2)   
1 ts salt   
\~ 1/8 ts gel food coloring (optional)  
1 1/4 cup no sugar added milk chocolate chips (almost a whole bag of a brand like Lily's)

* Rinse and drain the chickpeas at least 3x
* Blend the drained chickpeas, extracts, and almond milk until a smooth dough forms
* Mix in the peanut butter, sweetener, powdered peanuts, salt, and food coloring. Dough will be thick and difficult to work with
* Form filling dough into discs using a mold or your hands (I used silicone cupcake forms)
* Freeze filling disks for at least an hour
* In a microwavable bowl, melt the chocolate chips on high for 10-12 second intervals only (if you microwave them too long, the chocolate will seize) (mine melted in 24 seconds) 
* I used a silicone brush to paint a chocolate shell on the discs

Notes: Reese's cups average about 140 calories/oz, these are about 95 calories/oz, meaning a real Reese's cup of the same size would be about 560 calories instead of 370. A 4oz Reese's cup would have about 12g of protein, these have 8g. I was mostly going for reduced calories, if the macros can be improved while still keeping the taste remotely similar, I'd love to see it happen. The chunks in the filling are peanuts from the peanut butter, not unblended chickpeas. ",11,1768721428.0,Volumeeating,1,0.92,False

From finding out her Dad fathered a child with a VERY young girl a few months before my wife was born and then to top it off he named both kids the same name. She is struggling through the whole menopause thing and so am I to be honest. We've had a bratty teenage daughter to deal with (like a lot of people)

The things that grind my gears are things like I would like to join the gym but she gets angry at me saying its too expensive, she isnt really adventurous personally I love to travel and haven't done nearly what I want to do as my wife says she is interested but when push comes to shove she isnt. Id like to be able to buy a coffee without feeling guilt. It is just stuff like this that is getting me down.

Im at the point where I dont know if I can spend the next 30 or 40 years not doing what id like to do. We both are self employed work from home we earn good cash, we have a tiny mortgage on a home and we own outright another property.

I enjoy their company in office. But apart from that, I don’t know a single person in Chennai. 

I used to have a roommate in my pg as it’s 2 shared but 2 months ago , he moved to another pg because of his relocation. I don’t say it’s too boring , I go to movies alone in BSR mall or phoenix mall , go to beaches, restaurants, shopping and some experiments in cooking, coffees like that. Other than that just watching web series. It’s all good.

But one time I got a dengue fever last year and I literally have no one to come to hospital with me and it’s my first time going to hospital without anyone. Then I realised how lonely I am in Chennai and not a single soul to talk to (I meant close friends). After the fever , when I went to office my team and everyone said , why haven’t u called me when it’s that much serious man? We would have come to hospital right.. but I am hesitated really to call them, because I never called them outside office.

Then I remembered my friends in college , where even for a small sprains, my friends called college ambulance and took me to hospital (not exaggerating 😹). But I don’t know , Now I just talk to one friend in Bangalore , she is studying now and another friend in Hyderabad, he is trying for masters.I just call them and sometimes they call me.

1qg23kx,https://i.redd.it/xvuheurb72eg1.jpeg,Vietnam: A tough coffee market for global giants — and a broader lesson for exporters,"Vietnam is one of the world’s largest coffee exporters, yet it remains a surprisingly difficult consumer market for global brands like Nestlé and Starbucks.

The challenge isn’t demand — Vietnamese consumers drink coffee daily.

The challenge is consumer behavior.

In Vietnam, coffee is:

	•	Strong

	•	Familiar

	•	Affordable

	•	Habitual, not aspirational

This creates two structural constraints:

	1.	Premium pricing faces strong resistance

	2.	Global branding narratives often fail to resonate with local culture

Starbucks expands far more slowly than in markets like South Korea.

Nestlé sells large volumes but struggles to significantly premiumize its coffee products.

What’s interesting is that this isn’t a “coffee problem.”

It’s an export and localization problem.

Key takeaway for international trade:

Success in foreign markets depends less on brand power and more on:

	•	Local taste adaptation

	•	Cultural alignment

	•	Price sensitivity

	•	Regulatory and logistics compliance

Many exporters underestimate how deeply consumption habits shape market entry outcomes.

For Vietnamese SMEs exporting consumer goods (food, beverages, gifts, packaged products), logistics is not just about moving goods — it’s about moving the right product, in the right form, under the right rules.

From our experience supporting cross-border shipments from Vietnam to the US, Canada, Australia, and Singapore via Skyworld Express, the biggest risks exporters face are not transport costs, but:

	•	Misaligned product positioning

	•	Incomplete documentation

	•	Underestimating destination-market expectations

Global trade rewards understanding, not assumptions.

Curious to hear perspectives from others:

	•	Have you seen similar “strong exporter but tough consumer market” cases?

	•	How do you approach localization vs. brand consistency when entering new markets?",1,1768720903.0,Internationaltrade,2,1.0,False

This is meant to be a silly/fun trip given our kids’ ages (4 & 7) and the likely weather—we’ll do history, museums, temples and get outside of Tokyo (ryokans!) when they’re older and when they can appreciate a proper kaiseki meal.

So with all that said… what do you think of the itinerary below? Anything we should add/remove? Thanks in advance!

**DAY 0**: Arrive NRT 4pm (it was a LOT cheaper than HND), hope to be at hotel by 7:30/8pm. Get a quick dinner (UberEats?) and go to sleep.

We are currently booked at the Mimaru Suites Nihombashi as it looks relatively central and new, every room has two bathrooms, and the neighborhood (Ningyocho) could be interesting to explore.

**DAY 1: Jet lag recovery day**—we’ve done 3 other trips with the kids to Asia & Europe and day 1 is always rough. Options:

* Onsen, playtime, buffet and maybe massages for the grownups at Manyo Club Toyosu
* Or if the weather is decent: get fresh air at Sumida River Park/whale playground, go to Sumida Aquarium, maybe see Senso-ji and get snacks at Nakamise-dori
* Or if we really can’t sleep and are up at 5/6am, visit Meiji Jingu and then eat/explore Shibuya (including Pokémon & Nintendo stores if we stay in that area for a while)

Afternoon: explore the area around our hotel

**DAY 2 (Sunday): Legoland Discovery Center + Odaiba malls + Tokyo Giants evening game @ Tokyo Dome**

We all love Lego and my husband loves San Francisco Giants baseball, hence this itinerary. Trying to get infield tickets for the game when they go on sale but realize that could be difficult.

Diver City looks fun—Doraemon store, Hello Kitty cafe, good food court, and the Tokyo Chapter recommends Wabi Sabi for gifts. (Love her website!)

The general plan is to go to Legoland when it opens (we’ll get tix in advance), check out the rest of DECKS and Diver City, lunch at Diver City, go home to rest, and then go to Tokyo Dome, with dinner at the stadium.

Should we take the boat back from Odaiba to Asakusa (and from there, subway/etc to our hotel)?

**DAY 3 (Monday): Low-key day**

Possibilities:

* Try our luck with the Pokemon Cafe (I have very low expectations, but will try to book tickets) and go shopping (Ginza for me, Sanrio GiftGate Ginza, Pokemon stores, maybe Sunshine City mall for the kids)
* Or roam around Azubudai Hills / maybe see Zojo-ji and get some pics of Tokyo Tower
* Maybe Asobono indoor playground (I hear it’s amazing, but also hectic?)
* Kids are excited to see some latte art, so make a booking at Hat Coffee (Asakusa) or another latte art specialist

**DAY 4 (Tuesday): TeamLab Planets or Sanrio Puroland**

* I’m picking Planets over Borderless bc Planets ends its run in 2026 or 2027, but don’t feel strongly about this…and maybe we’ll visit both if we go to Azubudai Hills on Monday!
* Puroland seems like a lot to navigate if you don’t read Japanese…yes/no? I’m leaning towards TeamLabs but need to think about whether my 4 yo will be freaked out by the dark, the lights, etc.

If we do TeamLab Planets the plan would be to go when they open and eat lunch at Toyosu Market afterwards, unless there are better options nearby?

**DAY 5 (Wednesday): Kidzania or Cup Noodles Museum Yokohama**

If we do Kidzania we’ll go on Wednesday since I’ve forgotten most of the Japanese I learned in high school 😬😆

If Kidzania seems too exhausting we’ll do the Cup Noodles museum instead. Our kiddos are super excited to design their own Cup Noodles cups! And if we make it out to Yokohama we will likely check out their Chinatown.

Anything else we should see/do in Yokohama? (DNA Baystars stadium looks amazing for a game but don’t want to risk getting rained out)

**DAY 6 (Thursday): Low-key day**

* Mochi-making class (Ankotopia), taiyaki-making class or make your own daruma at HappyDaruma
* Do anything listed under Day 1 or 3 above
* Karaoke? 😊 kiddos are really into singing the entire K-pop Demon Hunters soundtrack right now
* If weather cooperates: check out this light show? [https://tokyoprojectionmappingproject.jp/en/](https://tokyoprojectionmappingproject.jp/en/)

**DAY 7 (Friday):** Go to one of the places we skipped earlier in the week (Sanrio Puroland, TeamLab, Kidzania) or maybe check out Miraikan + Small Worlds

**DAY 8:** Evening departure from NRT

Things we’re excited to eat:

* Teppanyaki (I went to a place in Roppongi Hills that blew my mind last year and I think it was just an average place by Tokyo standards—we just don’t have much teppanyaki in the US)
* Yakitori
* Soba
* Oshizushi (hard to find in the U.S.)
* Tempura and tendon
* Maybe shabu-shabu, despite the heat—it’s a good way to get a lot of veggies
* Gyudon (kids love it)
* Tonkatsu (husband loves it)
* Curry
* Strawberry kakigori
* Shokupan & sandwiches
* Classic Japanese breakfast—fish, rice, soup, pickles, maybe natto…I love a good Japanese hotel breakfast, too bad none of the Mimarus have restaurants

As I re-read this proposed itinerary I wonder if I’ve underplanned—like, will the kids be bored/will we frantically be trying to figure out what to do each afternoon, after the big morning activity?

But I’m also trying to make this trip “relaxing” (to the extent possible; no trip with younger kids is truly relaxing) and allow time for serendipity and exploration. We are totally fine skipping all the big theme parks (Disney, USJ, the new Pokemon park). And I also don’t want to set a go-go-go pace when the weather is likely to be pretty humid and wet.

Thanks again for your feedback & ideas!",2,1768720900.0,TokyoTravel,0,1.0,False
1qg235c,https://i.redd.it/iputvlo772eg1.jpeg,ABOUT ME ✨,"Hello, everyone! I’m back 😊 That’s why I’ve reposted everything from my old profile to this new one. Lately, I’ve been getting a bit more active on Reddit 🤣 First of all, I’m not here for NSFW stuff. I enjoy being here because it’s anonymous—I can freely comment and post, without being judged, because honestly, why would we care about each other that much, right? We’re all anonymous here anyway hahaha. 

So here are a few things about me:

I’m 27 years old, female, from Manila, Philippines, born in 1998,—a Scorpio girly. I’m currently working as a medical doctor. My favorite color is pink, and mahilig ako sa sabaw!! (tinola, sinigang, and bulalo). I really hate fishy smells, so I don’t eat seafood at all except for fried tinapa, galunggong, and daing na bangus. I also don’t drink coffee, so I honestly don’t know how I survived med school 🫥

Actually, my life is pretty boring, and I feel like I’m not that interesting 😅 Growing up, my routine was just school and home. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I’m not into partying pero by choice yan haaa hahahaha. I did try drinking alcohol, but I really didn’t like it. I enjoy helping out at charity centers, so if you have any projects like “giving back” in 2026, please include me! I like singing too, and I play the piano and drums. Back in college, I was a member of the chorale and a dance troupe (di ko rin alam bakit dami kong time dati). In high school, I used to join pageants and be a muse in basketball leagues, but when I started pre-med, I suddenly lost interest in those things, I just wanted to join quiz bees instead 😂 I study hard not because I love studying but because I don’t want to be misunderstood. If you look at my appearance, you might think I’m all about kaartehan hahahahaha

Sana wag niyo mamisinterpret photos ko sa profile ko HAHAHAHAH wala po ko balak maging NSFW model 🤣 I am here for memes, chika, hot takes, at comments na mas entertaining pa kaysa sa mismong post (aminin natin hahaha)

Expert na rin ako sa:

1. pag-type ng reply tapos i-delete (kasi nagbago isip)

2. pagtanggap ng notif na “your comment has been removed” kasi kulang sa karma HAHAHA

3. pagbabasa ng away na di naman ako kasali

4. pag-scroll na parang may hinahanap pero wala naman

Still learning when to comment, when to shut up, and when to just enjoy the chaos. Currently pretending I’m productive while scrolling endlessly. Sama-sama na lang tayong magpanggap 👀🤣

I’ve already met some people here whom I’ve talked to on Telegram, videocalled, even met in person and we’re still friends up to now. That’s why I’m looking forward to meeting more people here—those who are genuine and have clean intentions. Friendship, and nothing else.

Btw, thanks to everyone who followed me! Honestly, I don’t need a ton of followers, but I really do appreciate that you find me interesting. I truly value people who appreciate me.

I hope 2026 turns out well for all of us. May we all be happy and successful in life! 🥰 May God bless us all! 💗",2,1768720864.0,u_maizelish,0,1.0,False

1qg20zi,https://i.redd.it/0fbzceoh62eg1.png,"Matt, the boy I've been in love with for the past seven years","Matt, the boy I've been in love with for the past seven years, the one who just pecked me a few days ago, asked another girl to Prom.

""So, Jenny,"" Audra says excitedly, ""did you hear the good news? Matt finally asked me to Prom."" She tenderly rubs his back as I watch him visibly stiffen.



""That's...awesome, Audra,"" I somehow choke out.



I don't know why, but I assumed Matt and I would be going to Prom together.



He just felt me up, pecked me for the first time a few days ago.



Maybe because I naively assumed we'd be together by now.



Guess I was wrong.



My heart constricts in my chest, and I feel the sudden urge to flee.



""You guys are gonna look really great together,"" I tell them before taking a few steps and finding sanctuary in the girl's bathroom.



I lock myself in a stall and let the tears fall from my eyes.



A tear falls.



Then another.



And another.



That's when I realize this would be so much easier if I wasn't in love with him.



————————



""Jenny Marie Kearns! Turn off that alarm clock right now!""



I grab a pillow and clamp it down over my head, blocking out the sound of Mom yelling from downstairs. I'm not a morning person. I hate mornings. Birds singing. The sun shining through the slitted blinds in the window. Pancakes. Bacon. Coffee. Not my favorite things.



The smell of breakfast wafts through my open bedroom door and I try my best not to gag. This morning, I especially dislike the sounds and smells and sights of the day beginning.



Oh yeah, probably because I have a broken heart.



I think that's what this is.



My chest hurts. My heart hurts. My eyes hurt from the tears that wouldn't stop falling last night. Everything feels numb and heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest. Or trying to drown me.



""Jenny!"" Mom screeches.



I roll over and swipe the screen on my phone. The alarm stops blaring and Mom stops yelling.



Reluctantly, I force myself out of bed and head to the bathroom across the hall. I turn on the shower. Undress. Stand under the hot water. Let a few more tears fall. Shampoo. Shave. Conditioner. Dry myself off. Pick out jeans and a sweater. Blow dry my hair. Attempt to slap on some make-up. Deodorant. Grab a granola bar. Slip my backpack over my shoulder. Peck Mom goodbye. Head outside.



I'm frighteningly aware I'm just going through the motions.



He's standing by his jeep when a fresh wave of heartbreak hits me. It's not fair how handsome he is. Or that he'll never be mine. I'll never feel his rough, calloused hands caressing my bare skin again. Or his plush lips molding imperfectly to mine. Pretty sure that peck was his first. The first one he remembers, anyway. He really had no idea what he was doing. But I still liked it. Because it was Matt.



My Matt.



No, not your Matt. Someone else's...someday...



I walk towards him slowly, taking in as much of him as I can. Before he leaves for college and these morning car rides are swallowed up, a forgotten memory in the not-so-distant future.



His dark wash jeans hug his hips and the white long-sleeve shirt that stretches just enough over his muscled chest to make out the peaks and valleys of his pecs. The ones he rubs all over me when we're at the gym playing basketball. The ones I daydream about in the middle of Statistics.



Matt notices me staring at him and does a goofy, awkward wave. I shake my head, mumble, let's get this over with under my breath, and hurry over to the boy who doesn't want me. Romantically. Ever.



""Morning,"" Matt chirps as I slide into the passenger seat and buckle my seatbelt.



""Morning,"" I respond, trying hard not to look at him as we pull out of the driveway.



Maybe if I just stare straight ahead, the aching pain in my chest won't hurt as much.



""I have to run some errands after school,"" Matt tells me as he fiddles with the radio on the dash.



I close my eyes and sink into the seat beside him, praying the four-minute ride is over soon. The tension between us is thick and unyielding. ""I'll see if Fallon can give me a ride home.""



""No,"" Matt shakes his head. ""I meant I have to run some errands, but I was thinking we could grab a bite to eat after?""



My heart clenches in my chest. ""I'm busy tonight.""



Matt looks slightly dejected but recovers quickly. ""You have a hot date or something?""



""Or something,"" I mutter in response.



""What does that mean?"" he snaps. He hardly ever loses his cool and I'm even more uncomfortable by his anger than I was by his blatant rejection.



""Nothing,"" I swallow hard, trying to figure him out. He's always in a good mood. Why is he suddenly so...wishy-washy?



""You're seriously blowing me off because of Saturday?"" he raises his voice a little, causing me to protectively cross my arms over my chest. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's more hurt about the whole situation than he's letting on.



I scrunch my forehead. ""You're joking, right?""



Matt runs an exhausted hand through his brown hair. ""I don't understand why you're being like this.""



I shake my head, agitated. ""You do realize that less than 48 hours ago you were touching me, right? With no shirt on. Here in this car. Then you pecked me, told me you didn't mean to and that you can't cross that line again. Come on, Matt. I'm confused and humiliated. No one has ever seen me with my shirt off before. That was...it was too much. I just need a little bit of space, OK?"" And I'm in love with you. And it freaking hurts that you don't feel the same way.



""We can't even hang out now?"" His grip tightens on the steering wheel, his knuckles turn white. ""Can't even get food together?""



I want to tell him that we can. That we can just forget everything and go back to the way things were. But the words don't leave my mouth because the sharp pain in my chest is a constant reminder that it's not that simple.



""I don't want things to change, Jen. I'm trying really hard here to keep that from happening."" His voice is softer, full of emotion.



""But everything is changing, Matt,"" I find myself saying.



He turns his head, briefly looks at me before his eyes are back on the road. And, for the first time, I notice the dark circles under his coppery brown eyes.



""I don't want things to change,"" he quietly admits.



I want to reach out and touch his arm. Comfort him. Make him feel the warmth of my fingers on his smooth skin. That's something I might have done before but can't now because it's too awkward.



""We graduate in less than two months. Then you're going to UCLA to play basketball. Who knows where I'll end up? We're going in completely different directions. Maybe space is a good thing,"" I shrug. My head agrees with me, but I can hear what remains of my tattered heart screaming at me to take Matt up on his offer to grab food.



It's just food.



But food gives the illusion that things are fine. And they just aren't.



""You're killing me here, Jen,"" Matt exhales, totally deflated.



Yeah, you're killing me, too, Matt.



""We still have a class together and you drive me to school every day. Plus, we have basketball on Saturdays,"" I remind him. ""I'm not going anywhere. I just need...to figure out how to be around you after...theboobdebacle.""



A gentle laugh falls from his perfect lips. ""The boob debacle?""



I groan as I feel my face heat. ""Yeah, the first time a guy felt me up he was disgusted. Not really my finest moment.""



Matt pulls into a parking spot and puts the jeep in park. ""I...um...wasn't disgusted, Jen.""



I chuckle softly. ""Whatever. It's over and done with. I'm sure I'll have months, maybe years of therapy ahead of me now.""



Hopping out of his jeep, I open my granola bar, take a bite and start heading towards my first class.



Matt steps beside me, matching my pace. He doesn't continue the conversation and neither do I. We walk silently, neither of us brave enough to say anything more.



\-



""What?"" Fallon curses quietly in the corner of the cafeteria.



""Really?"" I shoot her an unimpressed look as I pull out my peanut butter and jelly sandwich.



""Sorry,"" she brushes her long, naturally blond hair out of her light green eyes. ""What the fudge.""



""That's better,"" I laugh.



""I know you're, like, the Virgin Mary here, but you seriously got to second base before first base. I'm so proud, Jenny,"" she fake cries. ""You're all grown up now. My work here is done.""



Fallon is my other best friend. The person I actually tell everything to. We've been friends since kindergarten and she is, as she claims, my worse half.



""I just don't get what I did wrong."" A hot breath of air escapes my lips. ""I thought he liked me. And you should have seen his face while he was...you know...touching me,"" I whisper. ""It didn't look like he hated it.""



Fallon shakes her head. ""I blame this whole thing on that bimbo Audra Jenkins,"" she begins. I exhale before she continues. ""She's been trying to come between you and Matt since 7th grade. Always lurking in the shadows, waiting for her perfect moment. She's been eating lunch with him every day for the past month. She's trying to get him to ask her to Prom.""



We both look over at Matt's table. The jock table. Football players, basketball players and cheerleaders. I'm allowed to sit there since I'm friends with Matt, but I never do. I don't fit in with that crowd. I'm not sure Matt does either.



Sure enough, Audra suddenly appears out of nowhere and sits down next to Matt. She's not a cheerleader. She's worse. Captain of the Dance Team. Which means she has the perfect body. Curved in all the right places. Toned and tan. Oh yeah, and she's extremely flexible. I had a gym class with her sophomore year, and she can do some interesting things with that body of hers.



I keep watching as Audra twirls her long, oaky brown hair between her fingers. She smiles at Matt. He seems a little uneasy as she gently touches his shoulder and whispers something in his ear.



""Five bucks says he still comes over here to walk to class with you,"" Fallon whispers. ""Cause even though Audra wants him, he really wants you, Jenny.""



I shake my head and turn to look at her. ""I already told you he made it clear he doesn't want me.""



Fallon shrugs. ""I don't care what he says."" She glances over at Matt and gestures for me to look. When his eyes lock on mine, I hear her say, ""He's only ever had eyes for you.""



The bell rings, breaking Matt and I's longer-than-usual eye contact. Fallon starts packing up her stuff as I stand and pick up my uneaten lunch.



Unsurprisingly, Matt strides over to our table to walk to History together.



""Is Fallon able to take you home today?"" he asks as he grabs my backpack off the table and hands it to me.



Before I can tell him that she said she can, she interrupts. ""Nope, sorry Matty. I have a very important doctor's appointment after school.""



Liar.



""Finally gonna get that STD taken care of?"" Matt retorts. He's never really cared for her. Always claims her promiscuous ways are unattractive and desperate.



""Is that your way of saying I sleep around too much?"" Fallon crosses her arms over her chest, challenging him. ""Because from what I hear, you've had your fair share of groping and feeling girls up lately.""



""Seriously, you two?"" I chastise as I walk away from them, rolling my eyes.



Children. They're both children.



""You told her?"" Matt asks in disbelief when he finally catches up to me.



""She's my best friend,"" I answer. ""Why wouldn't I tell her?""



Matt grabs my shoulder and gently turns me to face him. ""I thought I was your best friend?""



""You are."" I chew on my bottom lip. ""But you're not the person I want to talk about my first... experiences with.""



""Even if I'm the one you had them with?"" he counters.



""Matt...""



""Hey guys,"" Audra interrupts.



Matt looks annoyed as I tear my eyes away from his gorgeous face and greet Audra. ""Hey.""



""Mind if I walk with you guys to History?"" She elbows me in the arm and winks.



""Not at all,"" I smile at her before making room for her to stand between Matt and me. Which is what I'm assuming the nudge and wink were about.



""What were you guys talking about?"" she asks as if we've been friends for years and walking to class together is normal.



For the record, it's not normal.



""Nothing,"" Matt and I both say at the same time.



""So, Jenny,"" Audra says excitedly, ""did you hear the good news?""



I shake my head. ""No, what good news?""



""Matt finally asked me to Prom."" She tenderly rubs his back as I watch him visibly stiffen.



""That's...awesome, Audra,"" I somehow choke out. I don't know why, but I assumed Matt and I would be going to Prom together. Maybe because I naively assumed we'd be together by now.



Guess I was wrong.



My heart constricts in my chest, and I feel the sudden urge to flee.



""You guys go ahead"" I clear my throat. ""I'm going to head to the restroom before class.""



Audra gives me a breathtaking smile. I really hate that she's so pretty. ""Sounds good, Jenny.""



I start to walk away before I turn back around. ""Hey Audra?""



She looks over her shoulder as I watch her slip her hand in Matt's. ""Yeah?""



""When did he ask you?"" I'm not sure I want to hear the answer. But I know I need to hear it.



""Friday,"" she beams.



When the word hits my ears, I feel the last piece of my heart shatter into a thousand, tiny pieces.



""Jen,"" Matt steps forward, pulling his hand from Audra's.



""You guys are gonna look really great together,"" I tell them before taking a few steps and finding sanctuary in the girl's bathroom.



I lock myself in a stall and let the tears fall from my eyes, wondering how in the world there's anything left to cry out.

It's not bad honestly, beats the hell out of working in the mines anyway. The coal mines are pretty much the only thing anyone stays in town for, truckers come through sure but they never stay. A gas station, The Yellow Deli , and  Petey’s bar are the only other businesses in town and nepotism is their primary basis of hiring. So Diana's it is. Situated ten miles from town next to an old logging road its where I make my daily pilgrimage.

	

	I'm about to drive past the only break in the forest that line the road. An old barn with peeling pain and missing boards. The last thing I see before work. I look at it every day just as I am now. I looked back to the road to see a deer carcass directly in front of me. Quickly swerving, I just narrowly missed it. I was shaken. I turned up the radio which was playing “Trap Queen” by *Fetty Wap*. I quickly changed stations. 

	

	I got work ten minutes late as per usual and saw Ralph was already there cooking it up in the kitchen. As soon as I walked through the door Paula hobbled towards me with a look of disapproval on her face and a Marlboro Black 100 pressed between her fat wrinkled lips. I was expecting her to comment on my tardiness or on the fact that I was late again but instead she started on about something completely new. “I got a call from Augie last night and he was angry!!!! A customer called him and told him there was no soap in the bathroom! Bathrooms should be checked every hour!!!!” After her soap related lecture had concluded she hobbled out the door to her Gold 2009 Chrysler PT Cruiser Deluxe and cruised down the road. I doubt Augie actually said that, he has more important things to worry about with Diana's funeral this weekend and all.



	The second the door closed behind her Ralph began to mock her. “I got a call from Augie and he was horny! There were no lot lizards in the parking lot!!!!!”. There were always a lot lizards in the parking lot. They never came in the diner unless they needed to use the bathroom and we never let them stay in there too long. Ralph loves to tell this story in great detail but ill put it like this: the sink gets a lot of use as a shower. I glanced outside and of course there was a lot lizard in the parking lot. Leaning against the post that held the diners sign, smoking a Camel Crush cigarette. I looked back a few minutes later and she was gone. Normally they dont stay long but i didnt see a vehicle come by. I went behind the counter and got to work. “ Ey Ralph, you see where that lizard went?” i said over my shoulder

“Why? Are you lookin to use her services?”

“I don't have an Edipus complex like you”

“Youre gonna have a lot of doctors visits if you get to know her.” he replied before putting his earbuds back in.



	The diner was completely empty aside from a little kid sitting alone in the booth next to the bathroom. I thumbed at him over my shoulder and gave Ralph a quizzical look. “Oh yeah his Dads in the bathroom” he responded yelling over the music coming from his skull candy wired earbuds that only he could hear. I turned around and the kid was sitting on the stool closest to me at the counter. 

“My daddy's in the bathroom. I was listening to my mami and aunt kathy talking when i wasnt pose to an my mami told my aunt kathy that daddy play with his self while mami crys herself to sleep. Whats play with his self?”

Just then the bathroom door opened and his father exited, still fastening his belt yet forgetting to zip his fly. “Hey there’s sumthin with this mens room! It aint got no soap!” 

His son immediately began to relay a version of the one sided conversation between Paula and I. The father listened intently stroking his beard the whole time and when the boy had finished he laughed heartily and patted his big belly and said “Oh haha, all good fellas’ before taking his son by the hand and walking out to his lifted Ford truck. 

	Ralph burst out laughing. “ Man I tell you what today is looking up man . I hope the whole shift is like this man.” 

“If I hear one more thing about soap tonight I'm going to quit” I said half heartedly. 

“Then you better go refill the soap Mr. Soap Manager”

I wasn't actually the soap manager, Diana's diner has no such position.



	I walked into the bathroom and looked in the cupboard under the sink only to see we were out of soap. It occurred to me that maybe that man’s big fat belly was unusually lumpy but I hadn't thought about it too much. I have no idea why we trust people with our soap like this. I glanced at the trash can. It was overflowing as always. Fucking Paula can’t waddle her fat ass out to the dumpster twenty yards from the diner. I walked through the kitchen out the back door mumbling about trash and Paula to Ralph as I walked past.



	The dumpster was positioned at the back corner of the lot surrounded by a wooden fence and a gate that we were supposed to close but never did. It was getting dark so I hustled to the dumpster. Almost as soon as I got inside the fence I felt a strange feeling of calmness overtake me. Almost like nothing in the diner really mattered, maybe nothing in the world. I felt like I could stay out here forever. “HARRY GET IN HERE!” Ralph called from the back door of the diner snapping me out of the calm. It was like being ripped out of a warm shower and thrown into an ice bath. Shocking. I checked my phone as I was walking back, the shift was halfway over.



“I take it, you found that lot lizard?” he said as I walked through the kitchen.

“How long was I out there?” I asked.

“A couple hours I reckon. You didn't miss much just some truckers getting coffee to go and some old guy asking about fuel but he pronounced it ‘feel’. Oh and one of the truckers made that dumb joke he was all like ‘ I like my women like I like my coffee, bitter and made of beans’. I don't think that's how it's supposed to go but it still wasn't funny. Oh and he put out his cigar on the table in booth three you should probably go clean that up. I was gonna do it but I couldn't find any soap”

“Thanks Ralph”



Ralph was usually my best friend but he was kinda pissing me off tonight. I spit on the ash on the table and wiped it off with a rag. On the floor I spied a half pack of Blue american spirits on the floor under the table. Score! I went back and proudly showed them off to Ralph. He pulled out a baggie full of jimson weed and shook it with a smile. We were thinking the same thing. I played look out for customers while he diligently replaced the contents of two cigarettes with the contents of the baggie. We smoked our darts under the vent for the stove then flicked them out the back door.

Just then a pair of headlights pulled up the door and in came Paula practically hacking up a lung. I shooed as much smoke into the vent as possible and went to meet her at the counter. “Have you boys seen my cigarettes? I think I left 'em here”. said Paula coughing between most of her words. “ Nope a custy probably scooped em up” replied Ralph with a very obviously cigarette box shaped pocket. “ Ok, ok you boys have a good night and don't forget to check that soap!” She said before letting out a raspy laugh.

After Paula was gone we smoked two more jimson cigarettes leaving one in the pack that I took since I found them. The shift flew by after that for some reason and I think we was coming off the jimson weed by the time we closed up. Ralph went out to preheat his car whilst I made one last attempt to find some hand soap, I wouldn’t want to make Aug angry after all. Ralph came back in. “ My car wont start broski”

“I bet it aint got no gas innit.”

“Man how you know dat?”

“When you filled it up last?”

“Umm like i dont know, well can you gimma a ride home man?”

“Of course germ” 

	We got in my car and Ralph hooked up to the aux and pumped some good old fashion “Sicko Mode” by *Travis Scott*. I wish The Yellow Deli sold the McDonalds Travis Scott Meal, that shit looks fire asf. Anyway, We make our way towards town jamming out to some fire tunes. Casually Ralph said “ You should hit that thing on the road” On the Road in front of me was a dark lump. I didn't have enough time to react and slammed into it. I lost control of the car which swerved off the road and ended up in a ditch. “ Ok you didn't actually have to hit it i was joking”. 

“You could have given me more warning than that”

“Im gonna get out and push, wait there's that barn i bet there's a tractor innit. we call your car out”

“No fuck, Ralph get back here”



He had already runt oft the barn. I followed as close as I could and caught up to him when he was trying to open the door. “Man the doors stuck” he said.“It's a sliding door dumbass”. We slid the door open Ralph used the flashlight on his keychain to look around the barn. I felt that same familiar calming feeling yet dampened somehow, like a cool buzz before a blackout. “What the fuck did I tell you” he said proudly. There was in fact most of a tractor at the far end of the barn. “ That shit won't run” I didn’t think it would run but I just want to stay in the barn to get the full effects of the feeling. Ralph mounted the rusted seat of the tractor and tried to start the tractor and of course nothing happened. “Maybe there's some gas around here, and i think that jimsoms still cookin man cuz i feel fine as a flute” Ralph said, poking around the piles of trash. Behind the tractor was an old filthy blanket that clearly had something under it. I pulled the blanket off revealing the shirtless body of the lot lizard, well a woman but it was probably the lot lizard. 

I immediately pulled out my phone and did a quick hand of black jack on RainBet. I lost three hundred dollars and my phone died. But I was calm about it. “Did you do that” asked Ralph, referring to the shallow scratches on her back. “Shut up” I said calmly. Ralph started poking her with a piece of rusty metal and she shifted and turned over revealingSeveral empty bottles of hand soap and an empty pack of camel crush cigarettes laying next to her. Ralph poked her again for some reason (you can probably guess where) and she began coughing up hand soap. Soap poured from her nose and mouth and ears. Normally this would have upset me but I was very calm. Ralph looked at me and said “man Im calm”

“Yeah me too” I replied

“Calmer than you are, You think she wants to bang?”

“Bro she  basically passed out man that's fucked”

“I'm not a creep. Cast off your judgement,

I just never know when to goon…meatcanyon”



	I turned around and behind us stood a man dressed in a vibrant green suit. I calmly lit the last cigarette. “Who are you?” I asked. “Those who are quick to label themselves are often not what they claim” he said calmly. ”I think he meant your name,” Ralph chimed in calmly. The man calmly jerked his head to look at Ralph who was calmly shining his flash light in his eyes. “ It depends on whom you ask,"" he said in a slightly less calm tone this time. “Well I was asking you” I said calmly “ But can you call us a tow truck or something my car went off the road”. The man calmly shrieked so loud my ear drums began to bleed. I probably would have reacted but I was too calm. So what do you do around here, like what's your major?” I asked calmly. He turned around and left the barn. We followed him but when we were outside he was gone, I didn't even hear him run away. Because my ear drums had burst. I looked towards the road and there was a tow truck pulling up to my car. I was no longer calm and in immense pain. “ Do you think that was The Calming man?” said Ralph. He sounded muffled probably because I had ruptured my eardrums. “Yeah I think that was The Calming Man” I replied.

 the first day at a pastry shop my manager scolded me for using 5oz of milk instead of 4 and said I practically ruined the whole thing. then another time I was cleaning the station because the day was extremely slow and he yelled at me, saying that he never told me to clean the tables and if I was too blind to see that he already cleaned it. 

I could handle that but then he told me how fast I could do dishes, I was honest and said the question confused me because I never timed myself and he immediately grabbed his watch and told me he was gonna time me while I did the dishes. 

Last week he tried to get me fired because I mixed up 2 orders. the customers were both women with children around the same age and I put one receipt in my pocket and one on the table to remember the order but he demanded I placed both receipts on the table, I did and began the order and then midway he told me to begin the other one on top of refilling some things. I told him that I was gonna get confused and to please let me organize myself but he responded with something along the lines off ""you cant multitask? how have you ever maintained a job when you cant do that? its so basic its concerning"" so I tried, I really did, I got overwhelmed and began scratching my head and rocking back and forth as I prepared the orders and he was behind me and kept asking ""whats wrong with you? what are you doing? why are you packaging it like that?"" and I ended up mixing up the orders. he scolded me badly and told me to stay in the back and not touch or do anything, that he didnt want himself or the customers to see me, hear me, or even know i exist. later that day he made a call to the boss right in front of me and kept saying I kept making horrific mistakes and wasnt able to perform my job at all. 

somehow the boss didnt decide to fire me, but now it has turned into them excluding me from work events and groupchats. apparently there is a work groupchat that discusses schedules, upcoming changes, holiday offers, etc. about th workplace and found out I was the only employee excluded from it. he would just send me my schedule personally. not to mention apparently the boss invited everyone out to eat and it was the managers job to notify everyone and of course, I had no idea that happened until I heard coworkers talking about it. even hires that were newer then me got invited.

Last but not least the last time I was at work and ended my shift he didnt let me leave and told me to clean up the slushie and coffee machine. I did, but it wasnt enough, he gave me a screwdriver and told me take apart both machines to clean each part including the screws. maybe I should have spoke up but I didnt and I followed his orders, next day he got offended that I bought a coffee from the gas station rather then have a coffee from the store. I told him I didnt want to clean the coffee maker and that I also was just too tired to make it myself and he proceeded to tell me he could have made my coffee for me, that the coffee I was drinking was cheap and bad quality and told me ""next time you want a coffee, im gonna make it so you know what a real coffee is""

did I mention he hasn't put in the order for a work shirt? ive been using my own clothing despite there being a uniform with the logo on it, everyone has a shirt including the new hires but whenever I ask about it he always makes up an excuse ""their closed for the time being, there was an issue with the order, we think your shirt got lost while being transferred here"" etc. 

I dont have any other source of income but this job, I can barely afford food as is, ive been sending out dozens and dozens of resumes to anywhere, gas stations, fast food, bakeries, pharmacies, supermarket, anywhere that will take me but I havent gotten a call, its so bad that ive been having nightmares consistently and sometimes I cant sleep at all because my anxiety is so high and I started shaking and having meltdowns. 

I dont know what to do, some of my friends told me its just part of life and every job is shitty but other friends have told me this job is not worth the cost of my mental health. tomorrow I have a shift and im dreading it because not only is it with my manager but another coworker who doesn't seem to like me. 

I dont know what I did, ive tried to just do as im told, I try not to ask too many questions, I try to perform my best, I dont know what im doing wrong. I basically begged him to tell me what I can do to make him satisfied with my performance and he said nothing. LITERALLY ""nothing"" he didnt stay silent, just told me that one word and walked off. 

its 1am and im shaking, im nauseous, ive been scratching at my skin because everything feels wrong. please, how am I suppose to survive and maintain my basic needs when this manager is making my life hell?",2,1768720389.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

The woman was pristine. Gorgeous, polished, and effortlessly perfect. At least ten years younger.



I couldn't tear my eyes away. Until a blaring horn jolted me back to reality. Heart racing, I hit the gas, lurching into the flow of cars.

My heart felt twisted and bruised.



How could he?



If it weren't for the construction detour, I never would've found out.



The tears came fast and hot. I let them fall, furious that I still cared.



But I knew very well that everything was irreversible.



——



I wasn't supposed to be here, but there I was, parked across the street from her perfect little mansion, watching my husband ki-ss another woman.



He held her waist, their bodies close, their ki-ss long and too intimate to explain away.



Her house was everything mine wasn't—ivy-draped and nestled in the kind of neighborhood where fairytales lived. The woman was pristine as well. Gorgeous, polished, and effortlessly perfect. At least ten years younger, too young to afford such a mansion. Was it her parents'?



I couldn't tear my eyes away. They weren't trading affection—they were exchanging betrayal.



A blaring horn jolted me back to reality. I was blocking traffic. Heart racing, I hit the gas, lurching into the flow of cars.



I stole a glance in the rearview mirror, half hoping he'd spotted me, that maybe guilt would crack that smile. But no. He just got in his car, grinning like he'd won the lottery. When was the last time he'd smiled like that at me?



My heart felt twisted and bruised.



How could he?



The words crashed through me, blunt and undeniable. If it weren't for the construction detour, I never would've found out. Never would've seen my life crumble on a stranger's front porch.



That morning, he handed me a single rose. Brad, who never did romantic gestures. Had she gotten one too? Was I just one stop on his daily delivery route of affection?



Five years of marriage, and this is my reward? After carrying him through school and building a life I thought was unshakable. Turns out, it cracked wide open under a younger woman's ki-ss.



The tears came fast and hot. I let them fall, furious that I still cared.



I drove aimlessly, the questions circling like vultures. The car's silence didn't soothe me. It wasn't until the school parking lot came into view that reality tapped my shoulder: testing started in forty minutes.



I wiped my eyes and tried on a smile. It fit like someone else's clothes—tight, awkward, wrong.



""Emily! Wait up!"" Jennie jogged toward me, her usual grin fading as soon as she caught the sadness in my eyes.



""What's wrong?"" she asked, her voice low, steady.



The words fell out before I could stop them. ""Brad's cheating on me.""



Her jaw dropped. ""Oh my God. Em, that's bullsh-it. You're gorgeous—he's a moron. I'm so sorry, hon. I hope you're okay.""



""Thanks, Jen. I wish I hadn't, but I saw it."" My voice felt hollow, distant.



""Hey. Don't do that to yourself. You're better than this."" Jennie squeezed my arm as we walked into the building.



Cat posters and science fair projects lined the halls. The usual roar hadn't reached the building yet.



I forced another smile. It felt brittle. ""Thanks. I'll be fine. Work's waiting.""



Jennie hugged me, brief but warm, and headed to her classroom. I waved and slipped into my classroom, where the weight dropped on me again. Middle school English midterm papers from last week cluttered my desk, mirroring my mind. I hadn't touched them. Just the thought made my stomach twist.



I'd put off the work, thinking I'd be in a better mood this week. I was so wrong. I should have done these on Friday.



I couldn't focus, so I grabbed a coffee from the break room, hoping the bitter warmth would quiet the ache in my chest. It didn't. When I sat down again, the emptiness settled beside me like an old friend. I knew it too well. That familiar darkness tugged at me.



The phone rang, slicing through the quiet. I answered on autopilot, slipping into routine like armor against the breaking inside.



Brad was probably laughing with her right now, savoring the life I thought was ours. Had I been too boring? I'd asked him a few weeks ago, after a month of no intimacy, and he'd sworn I was enough. Liar.



By day's end, I was hollow. I gathered the kids' papers, turned off the lights, and stared down the thought of going home to Brad. I couldn't.



Sitting at the desk, I still had half of the English midterms to grade. But I didn't have the energy.



""Hey! Girl's night?"" Jennie's voice sliced through the fog in my head.



I looked up to see her standing in the hall, an excited glint in her eyes.



""I don't know..."" I hesitated.



""Come on, Em! You need a break. Brad?"" She waved a dismissive hand. ""Forget about him. He's an idiot.""



""I don't think I can,"" I murmured, feeling the tears threaten again. ""I can't just forget about him.""



Jennie arched an eyebrow. ""You don't need to. But you do need a night out."" She leaned in and whispered, ""I know a place. A clubhouse. You've never heard of it, right?""



""Clubhouse?"" My confusion must have shown. All I could think of were kids and treehouses. What kind of 'clubhouse' was she talking about?



Jennie's smile was sly, full of secrets. ""It's a place for people like us. You know... to have some fun. Let loose. Be free.""



Something in her tone made my stomach twist. She couldn't possibly mean sexual fun—she knew I was married. Even if my marriage was cracking open beneath my feet. ""Jen...""



She winked. ""Don't worry, you'll see. It's the kind of place people don't talk about in public.""



I shook my head, still unsure. ""I don't know if I'm up for that.""



""Why not? Brad's out, doing God knows what. He doesn't need to know what you're doing. You might as well have some fun too.""



I hesitated. What would it hurt? Would it make me feel better to get out, to forget for just one night?



""Just think about it, okay?"" Jennie added before heading out to her car.



I stood there a moment longer, torn. Then I waved her off, got into my own car, and sat in the driver's seat, still processing everything. Still wondering when I'd become the woman left behind.



On the way home, Jennie's invitation echoed in my mind like a reckless dare. I couldn't go. There was no way. I was a married woman, and married women didn't go to places like that.



But part of me wondered—when was the last time I'd done something reckless? Something for me?



I thought about Brad. About our perfect little life, built on routines and careful choices. A life where passion had faded into predictability.



No. I couldn't. I wouldn't.



Still, the thought clung to me all the way home.



When I pulled into the driveway, his car wasn't there yet. I parked, grabbed my bags, and stepped inside our quiet, tidy home.



It was modest—three bedrooms, two baths. Once, we'd talked about filling it with children. Now I was grateful for the silence.



I glanced at the framed photos lining the hall. Old school photos of both of us covered the walls. And five smiling couples' photos, one for each year of our marriage. In every single one, Brad looked happy, holding me close, smiling like I was his world.



So why was he ki-ssing his assistant?



In the kitchen, I set to work making his favorite: biscuits and gravy, all from scratch. Part of me still wanted to win him back, to remind him who loved him first.



As I kneaded the biscuit dough, my thoughts turned darker. I imagined spitting in the mix or slipping in a little something from the medicine cabinet. Punish him a little. Teach him not to mess with me. Just enough to give him a night on the toilet, nothing serious.



I could almost see him doubled over, blaming bad takeout.



But no. That wasn't me. I pressed the thought away and threw my frustration into the dough.



When the biscuits were ready for the oven, I turned to the gravy, stirring it until it thickened into something rich and comforting. The house filled with the familiar scent of home, of normalcy.



But nothing felt normal anymore.



I set the table with care. My favorite Merlot for me. His Crown Royal on the rocks.



The garage door rumbled open. My pulse jumped.



I stood by the door, waiting.



When he finally stepped inside, briefcase in hand, he froze in surprise. His eyebrows lifted. I held out his glass.



""A drink for my husband. Welcome home, my love.""



He took the glass, dropping his briefcase with a thud. He eyed the drink suspiciously before raising it in a toast. ""Thank you, dear. What's the occasion?""



I forced a smile and clinked my glass against his. ""No occasion. Just wanted to welcome you to our home of wedded bliss.""



He chuckled softly. ""Well, thanks."" He took a sip and turned to head toward the bedroom.



""I've made dinner too,"" I called after him. ""When you're changed.""



He paused and glanced over his shoulder. ""Dinner too? What is it, my birthday?""



He laughed again and disappeared into the bedroom.



I followed slowly, watching him undress.



As he stripped, his muscles stretched and moved. He was six foot, in great shape, a fantastic head of hair, and some salt and pepper on the sides. It was no wonder that younger woman was attracted to him.



He changed out of his slacks and button up and into jeans and a t-shirt and set his glass on the dresser. As he emptied his pockets, he looked at me and asked, ""How was your day, dear?""



I wanted to tell him everything. I wanted to scream that I saw him ki-ss another woman.



Instead, I said, ""It was fine. Standardized testing this week.""



""Ah, so a week of babysitting?""



""Pretty much.""



He smiled faintly and we walked back to the dining room together. The table was set, the biscuits golden, the gravy steaming.



He loaded his plate and moaned softly as he took a bite.



His moan—too close to pleasure—made my stomach lurch. I hated that. Did she make him moan like that too?



""This is so good. Thank you, love,"" he said between bites.



""You're welcome.""



He paused, looking at his plate. ""It must've been a lot of work.""



""It was. I wanted to do something special for you today.""



He frowned slightly, confused. ""sh-it, it's not our anniversary, is it?""



I smiled, bittersweet. He'd missed our anniversary six months ago. ""No, not our anniversary. Just wanted to feed your love for me.""



""Aww, that's sweet, dear."" He finished his meal, drained his glass, and stood up to pour another drink.



As he tipped the bottle, he said casually, ""I have a trip this weekend. Leaving Friday, back Sunday.""



A trip. Alone.



I searched my memory—had he ever taken a solo trip before?



""Where are you going?"" I asked.



""Conference across the country. Sorry, dear, only one ticket or I'd bring you along.""



""That's okay."" But my stomach clenched. Was he taking her?



Tears welled in my eyes before I could stop them.



He saw them and quickly crossed the room, taking my hand and ki-ssing the back of it. ""Don't worry, love. I'll be back before you know it.""



Then he turned and walked away.



I sat there alone, clearing the plates, rinsing them in the sink, loading the dishwasher. My body moved through the motions, but my mind was miles away.



I couldn't tell him I knew.



Even though every part of me screamed to.



I poured myself another glass of wine and settled onto the couch. The TV flickered through crime dramas, and I let myself get lost in a world where husbands with secrets got what they deserved. In one episode, the wife poisoned him because she found out he had another family.



What if Brad had another family?



The thought chilled me. But that was ridiculous. Brad couldn't handle one family, let alone two.



After a while, Brad reappeared to pour himself another drink, smiled at me like nothing was wrong, and returned to the bedroom.



I watched another episode. My heart felt hollow. My body... restless.



Finally, I turned off the TV and marched back to the bedroom. Enough pretending.



Brad was lying on the bed, scrolling on his phone, smiling at something—or someone.



I leaned against the doorframe and slowly slid the straps of my nightgown down my shoulders. He didn't notice.



I let the gown fall to the floor and tossed it onto his phone.



He blinked in surprise, eyebrows raised.



""Oops,"" I said, my voice soft but sharp. ""Did I interrupt you?""



He gave me a tired smile. ""Not tonight, hun. I don't feel so good."" He tossed the nightgown aside like it meant nothing. Like I meant nothing.



I stood there, na-ked, exposed, and rejected.



That usually worked. My cheeks flushed and I suddenly felt overexposed. My arms crossed my chest instinctively.



Maybe he was sick. Or maybe he just wasn't interested in me anymore.



I pulled on a big sweater to hide my embarrassment, and I crawled into bed beside him.



""Goodnight, dear,"" he said, rolling over.



""Goodnight. I hope you feel better."" I could still feel the burning in my cheeks.



""Thanks,"" he murmured, and turned out the light.



I stared at the ceiling in the dark, feeling more alone than I ever had beside him.



Jennie's words echoed in my mind. The clubhouse. A place to be free. A place to feel wanted.



Maybe... maybe I needed that.



The thought of someone else's touch made my pulse quicken. Made me ache.



Slowly, I slipped a hand beneath the covers, beneath my panties, and touched myself. I was already wet, my body starved for something—anything—that felt like desire.



My fingers moved slowly; my breath caught, my body trembled. The ache inside me crested and broke in a flood of release.



Afterward, as the ache faded and exhaustion pulled at me, clarity settled in.



Maybe I would go to the clubhouse after all.



Brad was already gone when I woke up. No note, no ki-ss goodbye—just an empty side of the bed cooling in the morning light. Typical. I threw back the covers and forced myself through my morning routine.



After a hot shower and a little mascara, I felt almost human again. But not quite. Something was missing—something warm and comforting. I decided to leave a little early and take a detour.



Starbucks. That would help.



I pulled into the nearly empty drive-thru and ordered my usual latte. A small reward for surviving my own life. The barista's cheerful smile and the warm cup in my hand gave me a flicker of joy. I smiled back, determined to face the day with something resembling cheerfulness.



When I got to the school parking lot, I spotted Jennie pulling in. I waited until she parked, then waved her over. She grinned as she walked toward me, her eyes immediately landing on the cup in my hand.



""Ooo, you got some 'bucks. Nice!""



I took a sip and smiled. ""Yeah. I needed a little something extra this morning.""



Jennie laughed, tossing her hair. ""Girl, you need a lot more than a little."" She held the door open for me as we walked inside, still chuckling.



I waved goodbye and headed to my classroom. A note was taped to my door. I sighed and peeled it off.



We need you to cover after-school duty today — Adam.



Great. I was early, and now I'd be staying late. At least I had my latte.



I stepped into my classroom, letting the familiar quiet settle around me. I sat at my desk, wrapped my hands around the cup, and savored those few peaceful moments before chaos began.



The morning passed in a blur of standardized testing. Mostly, I just sat at my desk while the kids filled in bubbles. It was easy work but draining in its own way.



Finally, lunchtime arrived. I locked my door—my little escape with a microwave and mini fridge tucked in the corner.



Just as I reached for the lock, the door burst open, nearly smacking me in the face.



""Hey Em, mind if I join you for lunch?"" Jennie's head popped in, all sunshine and mischief.



I jumped back, heart racing. Then I laughed. ""da-mn, Jennie! Scared the he-ll out of me.""



She slipped inside and clicked the lock. Striding over to the microwave, she popped in a frozen burrito and hit two minutes. ""So, what's the verdict? Clubhouse this weekend?""



I hesitated. I'd been thinking about it all morning, but now that she asked, my resolve crumbled. I pulled out a cup of mac and cheese, added water, and waited for the burrito to finish.



""I don't know... I don't think I could do that to Brad.""



Jennie gave me a look like I'd grown a second head. ""fu-ck Brad. He clearly doesn't care about what he's doing to you."" The microwave dinged, and she grabbed her burrito.



I placed my mac and cheese in the microwave and set the timer. Leaning against the counter, I crossed my arms.



""Yeah, but just because he's cheating doesn't mean I should.""



Jennie plopped down in a chair, unwrapping her burrito. ""Oh, I know exactly what I'd do.""



And I did too. Jennie had always been bold—always unapologetic. I remembered a guy who cheated on her once—she slept with his roommate to get even.



I smirked. ""Yeah, sleep with his best friend.""



""You know it!"" She laughed and made an exaggerated show of deep-throating her burrito.



I burst out laughing despite myself. The microwave beeped again. I stirred my mac and cheese as I sat beside her. I asked, ""So what exactly is this clubhouse?""



Jennie's eyes lit up, and she turned toward me, speaking with animated hands. ""Ooo girl, it's a magical place. Seriously. I feel more at home there than in my own bed.""



""Magical? Really?""



""Really. It's where people go to let their fantasies run wild.""



I swallowed a bite. ""You said it was for... sexual stuff. What exactly do you do there?""



She grinned. ""Mostly talk. If I vibe with someone, we play. There are lots of rooms—some private, some public. And there's a dungeon.""



I nearly choked. ""A dungeon? Like... medieval torture?""



Jennie laughed, wide-eyed. ""Not gross. Amazing. It's where kinksters go to play.""



""Kinksters?"" The word felt strange in my mouth.



""BDSM people. Bondage, impact play, domination... all the fun stuff."" She winked.



I blinked, overwhelmed. ""And what about... you know... STDs?""



""Honestly, most people there get tested regularly. It's part of the culture.""



That was a new one. ""Do you get tested?""



""Of course, babe. I wouldn't play if I wasn't clean. I test on the reg.""



I looked down at my food, unsure what to say. Jennie had always seemed so sweet, so put-together. I had no idea she was living this double life.



I had to ask. ""How many partners do you have, Jennie?""



She smiled kindly, resting a hand on my forearm. ""No offense taken. Everyone starts with curiosity."" Then, as casually as if we were discussing weekend plans, she said, ""Right now? Two. And they both know about each other.""



I stared. ""How'd you manage that?""



""Met them at the clubhouse. They know what's up. A few weeks ago, we all went to a concert and rented a hotel room after. Best night I've ever not slept through.""



I gawked. ""You mean—""



""Yup. Both of them. I felt like a queen with my loyal subjects."" She grinned.



I couldn't help but laugh. Jennie's confidence was contagious.



The bell rang, breaking the moment.



""sh-it, gotta go."" Jennie stood, gathering her trash. At the door, she paused. ""What are you doing tonight? Girl's night?""



Her invitation warmed me. She could've spent the evening with either of her partners, but she was choosing me.



""Thanks, Jennie. I'd love that.""



She smiled and yanked open the door, releasing a flood of middle schoolers into the room.



The peace vanished in an instant. One kid shoved another, who fell flat on her face. Laughter erupted, and the girl burst into tears.



I sighed. ""Alright, guys, let's get to our seats, please."" I squatted next to the fallen student. ""You okay?""



She wiped her tears and nodded, heading to her desk. The boy who tripped her grinned and waved as she sat in front of him.



""Leave me alone, Tommy!"" she snapped.



Ah, middle school love. Boys picked on the girls they liked, and girls pretended they didn't care. The cycle never ended.



Another boy nearby smirked. ""I didn't do anything.""



I shook my head and gathered the stack of tests. ""Alright, everyone. Number two pencils ready. Fill in your bubbles completely.""



I handed out the next round of standardized tests and watched them settle into bored concentration.



Returning to my desk, I couldn't stop thinking about what Jennie had told me. A dungeon. BDSM. Play partners.



I unlocked my phone and hesitated, glancing at the class. No one was paying attention.



I typed: What does BDSM stand for?



The first result popped up: Bondage, Discipline, sa-dism, Masochism.



My pulse quickened. It sounded dark. Intense. Nothing like my life.



Curious despite myself, I clicked on the images. Restraints. Leather. Crops. Hands gripping wrists, eyes blindfolded. Men and women, switching roles, bound in pleasure—or was it pain?



Heat crept up my neck. I shoved the phone into my desk drawer.



This wasn't the time or place. I took a slow breath and tried to steady my racing heart.



Two more hours until the day ended. Two more hours to pretend this was just another Tuesday.



But it wasn't. Not anymore.

Just wanted to drop an appreciation post for The Caffeine Baar’s Frozen Cherry beans (Barbara Estate, Chikmagalur). This coffee genuinely impressed me.

The cup turned out clean, sweet, and very expressive. The juicy mango and mixed berry notes came through clearly without any fermenty harshness or bitterness. Bright but controlled acidity, smooth mouthfeel, and a really pleasant finish. Easily one of the more enjoyable processed coffees I’ve brewed recently.

Quick brew details (V60):

	•	Coffee: 15 g (freshly ground)

	•	Water: 250 ml (≈ 1:17)

	•	Bloom: \~45 ml for \~35 seconds

	•	Temp: started at \~92°C, naturally dropped    to \~87°C by the end

	•	Pouring:

	•	First pour to \~150 ml by \~1:15

So basically I ended up in Vizag for work and couldn't do much on weekends other than hobbies. Difficult to make new friends here. Have gone to movies alone, had gone to cafes and restaurants alone (many) and lots of walks on the beaches 🏖️. 

I felt like it would be better if there's a friend of other gender where we can share thoughts and chat and discuss about life and universe. Dating apps led to scamsters or silences. 

Any female interested for a friendly coffee in Vizag can DM. Can meet on any free day only after you get comfortable in chat. I know the leads are small or nil, but as they say, reddit is different, let's see. 

I'm male and I have a working job.

Rest details in DM 🙂

And yeah, it'll be a fresh choice or bean board or some popular cafe or at beach etc. with the first bill entirely on me. 

//Note 1: Please don't give gyan that why only female friend, why not male friend. It's to make friendship now and understand each others perspectives but the future intention is to date if vibes and personalities match. Mere friendship would do as well. 

Note 2: Bill entirely on me because I'm the one asking out for the coffee. Also, it's not to discourage anyone who's interested in a coffee but does not DM if they feel they can't/won't pay! If you're someone who definitely wants to pay 50% for damn sure 100%, I don't mind. But unless you insist, it's on me. 

Note 3: I know subreddit rules disallow many things. I removed any references to my personal information. I shared my age and height and job but removed it for both privacy and protecting personal space. Rules also disallow looking for friends or such but the first para is about my life in Vizag and the rest is about what I'm doing or feeling in Vizag. This post must be looked from a Vizag life perspective. So mods be moderate! 

Further notes will follow if I need to clarify.

Thanks in advance.

(You're welcome, KU)","Four years. That’s how long we spend climbing that hill. We queue for the same morning coffee, we stress about the same exams, and we walk past the same fountain every single day.

But be honest: Do we actually know each other?

Hamro sathi circle ta First Year mai ""lock"" bhaisakcha. Engineers stick with Engineers. Law students debate with Law students. Med students exist in their own galaxy. We live 5 minutes apart, but it feels like we are worlds apart.

Hallai halla ma 4-5 barsa bitcha, ani chineko tei 5-10 jana matra huncha.

We realized that regular apps (Tinder, Bumble) felt completely wrong for KU. They felt unsafe, full of random people, and honestly... weird. Specially for the girls on campus, putting your profile out there feels risky when anyone can see it.

So we stopped complaining and started coding.

We built KUPID. Not a ""Dating App"". A Safe Campus Social Layer. Built by students, exclusively for students (verified by university email).

# 🛡️ Built for Safety & Peace of Mind (Why this works)

We designed this so you never have to worry about ""Who sees me?"".

1. 🎓 Verified Students Only (No Randoms) KUPID is locked. You need a valid KU email to get in. That means no random ""dai"" from the outside world, no fake profiles, and no creeps. Just us students.

* Campus ko environment, campus kai manche.

2. 🚨 One-Click Reporting (Zero Tolerance) We take safety seriously. If someone is being weird, creepy, or disrespectful:

* The Fix: You can report them with one click.
* The Promise: We review every report personally and ban bad actors immediately. No automated ""support tickets"", we actually read them and take action. 

3. ❤️ Hearth (The ""Department Blocker"") The biggest fear? ""Department ko manche le k bhanchann?"" (What will my department say?).

* The Fix: You can block entire programs.
* The Feeling: If you add ""Computer Engineering"" to your Hearth, you become invisible to them. You don't see them, they don't see you.
* Afno department ma awkward hunu pardaina. 

4. 🌫️ Ojhel (For the Past you want to Forget) Sometimes, specific people ruin the vibe. An ex? A toxic lab partner?

* The Fix: Put them in ""Ojhel"". Type their name, and our system (using fuzzy matching for typos) ensures your paths never cross again on the app.
* The Feeling: Aakha agadi nabhaye pachi, man ma pani hudaina. (Out of sight, out of mind).

5. 🎭 Campus Wall (The Digital Fountain) Sometimes you just want to scream into the void.

* The Feature: An anonymous community feed.
* The Vibe: Share confessions, crush posts, or just exam stress without anyone knowing it's you. It’s like the backbench guff, but for the whole college.

6. 🔒 Zero Knowledge (Math > Trust) You shouldn't have to trust us with your secrets. So we built it so we can't know them.

* The Tech: True End-to-End Encryption (X25519 + Argon2id).
* The Promise: Your ""Conversation Password"" encrypts everything on your phone. Our database looks like random garbage text.
* Hamile khojera pani tapai ko message padhna sakidainau. Even if you lose your password, mathematically we cannot recover your old texts. They remain locked forever.

# 🚀 The ""Beta"" Reality (Please Read)

We are currently live for SOL (Law), SMS (Medical), and SOM (Management).

To my friends in SOE (Engineering) and SOS (Science): I know. It sucks to wait. But we are students too, running this on student budgets. Scaling a real-time server is hard, and we are terrified of crashing the app before you get a chance to experience it. You are the next wave. And I promise you: the next post will be for all of you.

I will go to the dentist soon but does this warrant an immediate call on Monday? 

I do smoke a vape. 

I drink Coca Cola & chew on mentos mints a lot. 

I also chew on ice all day everyday. I go through a 16 pound bag of ice per week chewing on it. My doctor said I have something called “pica” at the moment. 

I have anemia & other unknown nutrient deficiencies at the moment. I have low red cell blood counts & high white blood cell counts & my blood tests have been consistent this way since at least June of 2025 when I got a check up.

1qg1k5l,https://i.redd.it/tdgm9hpn12eg1.png,Divorce Was One Word—But It Destroyed Him,"Chapter 1 Ditch Her There

""I agree to marry you."" Outside the city hall, Britney Santos stared at the already closed doors, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.



Today was supposed to be the day she and Aaron Galloway got their marriage license.



But she'd waited from nine in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon, ending up with over a dozen queue tickets clutched in her hand. Aaron never showed.



He was the one who'd suggested getting married, and he was the one who'd stood her up. This was already the third time he'd flaked on her.



Britney tossed the useless tickets into the trash, turned on her heel, and called her longtime rival, Fredrick Pollard.



She still remembered how, the first time she'd been ditched here, Fredrick had straight-up asked her to marry him instead. But she'd turned him down.



The second time played out the same way.



This morning, Fredrick messaged her about marriage again. And this time, she said yes.



Just a moment ago, she'd spotted a post in her social media feed. It was from Aaron's old flame, his crush.



In the photo, Aaron sat ramrod straight, meticulously slicing an apple, with the caption: \[Whenever I need him, he's always there. That's true favoritism, the kind of confidence only he can give me.\]



Britney let out a self-mocking smirk, gave it a casual like, and commented: \[Locked in forever. Wishing you eternal bliss.\]



To her surprise, her heart felt completely at peace.



In the past, she would've screenshot it immediately and confronted Aaron, demanding to know what the hell it meant. It would've sparked a huge fight. And it always ended with him slamming the door on his way out.



But now, she didn't even feel like getting angry. She was truly done with Aaron.



The voice on the other end snapped her back to reality. ""I'm on a business trip. I'll be back in a week. If you're still up for it, meet me at the city hall at nine.""



Fredrick's words lingered in her ear, and it finally clicked why Fredrick, the guy who'd waited outside the hall to propose the last two times, had only sent a message today.



She thought, 'A week, huh?' She could read between the lines. He was giving her time to wrap things up with Aaron, and a chance to back out if she wanted.



Softly, she replied, ""I'll be there.""



After hanging up, Britney drove back home.



She lived in a vintage apartment in the city center. When Aaron found out, he'd bought the unit next door and knocked down the wall to connect them.



They shared one big space but still had their own private areas. He'd put the whole place in her name when he bought it.



Now, as she stared at the sprawling apartment, every corner was littered with reminders of their time together.



Photos of the two of them, matching couple's stuff everywhere, even the layout tailored to his tastes. What used to feel like bliss now just seemed bitterly ironic.



In a few hours, she gathered up everything tied to her and Aaron, stashed it in the storage room for now, and planned to toss it all tomorrow.



Gazing at the newly emptied space, she called a real estate agent to list the place for sale. If she was really letting go, there was no point holding onto anything connected to him.



""Yeah, price isn't an issue. Just sell it as quick as you can,"" she said firmly, cutting off the agent's hesitant questions.



""What house?"" The familiar voice from behind made her freeze.



She ended the call and turned to face Aaron, who'd been MIA all day, casually replying, ""A friend wants to sell theirs and asked me to handle it.""



Before the words were even out, she spotted Patti Medina standing behind him, and her expression darkened.



Aaron didn't pay much attention to Britney's words. He just turned to her and said, ""Patti's depression has flared up again. I didn't feel right leaving her home alone, so I brought her here to stay for a few days. Go ahead and tidy up the guest room for her.""



As he spoke, Patti nervously latched onto his arm, casting a timid glance at Britney. ""Aaron, if it's too much trouble, let's just forget it. Ms. Santos doesn't seem very happy about this.""



In one fell swoop, Patti shifted the blame onto Britney, who hadn't said a thing, her eyes filled with a subtle hint of hurt.



At that, Aaron's expression darkened instantly. ""Britney, even your tantrums have limits. You know damn well Patti's not in a good place, yet you still left that snarky comment on her post.



""Now you're trying to block her from staying here? When did you turn into such an unreasonable person? I can't stand women who are so petty and small-minded.""



He doubled down, laying it out flat. ""Don't forget, this place is mine too. I decide who stays here. I'm just letting you know, not asking for your approval.""



Through it all, Britney hadn't said a single word, but somehow she was stuck in the middle of their tag-team accusations. She found the whole thing absurd. ""Suit yourselves.""



Aaron had clearly forgotten the house was in her name. But if he insisted on having Patti move in, she couldn't really argue against it.



She looked away indifferently and headed upstairs.



With Patti in the picture, Aaron's focus would never shift to her, like how he'd come home without a word about standing her up, only rushing to get Patti settled.



He'd probably even forgotten they were supposed to pick up their marriage license today.



Britney wasn't holding out any hope anymore.



Back in her bedroom, she showered and overheard voices from the next room, realizing Aaron had given up his own space for Patti.



It didn't stir much emotion in her. Even if Aaron and Patti slept together, it wouldn't shock her. She could accept it without batting an eye.



Britney had come to see that, once she'd truly let go of him, all those things that used to drive her crazy now felt like nothing. She didn't care at all anymore.



With her mind at ease, she soon drifted off, her eyes fluttering shut.



Right on the brink of sleep, she felt a soft movement beside her.



The next instant, she was enveloped in a warm hug. Her body stiffened just a bit.



Aaron held her close from behind, his cheek nestled against her neck as he murmured, ""Sorry, I didn't mean to flake today. Patti's situation was dire. If I'd shown up any later, she might not have made it.



""Britney, she's got no one else but me. I can't just leave her hanging. Let's hold off on the marriage license for now. Once she's stable, we'll go get it.



""Then I'll give you the grand wedding you deserve. While she's here, can you just not make waves? Focus on her needs for a bit? I'll make it up to you afterward, I swear.""



Hearing him postpone things yet again for Patti's sake, Britney stayed calm, a wry smile curling her lips.



His every word revolved around Patti. Even in this supposed apology, he was really just fretting that she'd mistreat her.



Britney had intended to fake sleep, but his arms around her now turned her stomach.



Finally, she slipped out of his grasp without a fuss, keeping her back to him as she said, ""Whatever's between you and Patti is your business. Do what you want. You don't have to run it by me.""



""Britney."" Aaron's voice edged with irritation. To him, she was obviously just pouting.



In the past, anytime Patti came up, she'd pull this same sarcastic routine. He figured he'd already swallowed his pride, so her carrying on like this was just immature.



Britney picked up on his anger but kept her back turned, saying nothing.



Seething, Aaron bolted upright in bed, his face contorted as he geared up to lay into her.



Before he could say a word, a figure dashed in from the doorway and wrapped him in a tight hug from behind.



Chapter 2 You're Boring

""Aaron, I'm a little scared being alone."" Patti's voice trembled from behind him.



Aaron reached out right away, taking her hand and soothing her softly. ""What's the matter? Not comfortable in a new place?""



Patti just nodded faintly.



As he saw her like that, Aaron's heart ached. ""I'll stay with you. Don't worry.""



""Sorry, I... did I interrupt you and Britney?"" Patti's gaze shifted to Britney, as if she'd only just noticed her presence.



Her voice quivered with anxiety. ""I know Britney doesn't really welcome me here, Aaron. This is all my fault. Please don't argue with her because of me. I'll just leave.""



Aaron glanced instinctively at Britney. ""No, she's not that petty...""



Before he could finish, Britney stood up, her smile laced with sarcasm. ""Don't let the door hit you on the way out.""



She hadn't uttered a single word, yet Patti kept dragging her into the middle of it time and again. Even a saint had limits, and Britney had never been the type to roll over and take it.



Patti seemed stunned at first, clearly not expecting the typically patient Britney to outright tell her to go. She blinked back her reddening tears, looking pitifully at Aaron beside her.



As he saw Patti reduced to tears by Britney's words, Aaron's expression turned stormy. ""Britney, you're going too far. I brought Patti here. Who gave you the right to throw her out?



""Her depression's acting up, and you're still coming at her like this? How did you become so hostile?""



Without giving Britney a chance to respond, he turned and gently wiped the tears from Patti's cheeks. ""It's alright, Patti. As long as I'm here, I won't let Britney bully you.""



Patti leaned softly into his embrace. ""I know you care about me, Aaron. After all, Britney's your fiancée. It's my fault. I've been leaning on you too much.



""I realize this isn't right, but you're the only one I have left. I don't know who else to turn to. Please don't fight with Britney over me.""



As she said this, her eyes flicked toward Britney with a defiant glint, silently mouthing: You lost. Admit it. You can't beat me.



Britney had convinced herself that her heart was numb to it all by now.



But as she watched Aaron jump to Patti's defense without hesitation, a fresh wave of pain stabbed through her chest.



She couldn't be bothered to engage with Patti's provocation. Her stare turned cold as ice as she fixed it on the two of them. ""Get out.""



Britney was issuing an eviction notice, plain and simple.



Aaron locked eyes with her, calm and devoid of any ripple, and for no clear reason, a surge of unease crept over him.



He knew full well how deeply Britney felt about him; otherwise, she never would have tolerated his repeated no-shows.



In the past, when she'd get worked up, a bit of gentle coaxing from him was all it took to calm her down. But this time, he could tell something had shifted in her.



Aaron started to say more, but Patti disentangled herself from his arms.



She approached Britney timidly and extended a hand. ""Britney, are you still upset? It's all my fault. I'm sorry. Don't take it out on Aaron.""



The instant Patti's fingers grazed toward her, Britney jerked back sharply. She couldn't stomach the idea of her touch; it turned her stomach.



With that abrupt yank, Patti yelped in surprise and stumbled backward. She hit the floor with a thud, right at Aaron's feet.



""Patti."" Aaron dropped to a crouch and swept her up in a princess carry.



Almost in the same moment, Patti whimpered through her tears. ""Aaron, don't blame Britney. I upset her. It's my fault. It's understandable she'd snap like that. Don't hold it against her.""



With just a few words, Patti pinned the blame for her fall squarely on Britney.



She hadn't even made contact with Britney. But her phrasing made it crystal clear to Aaron that Britney had shoved her.



Sure enough, after hearing that, Aaron glared furiously at Britney. ""Britney, you've gone too far. Apologize to Patti right now.""



He'd swallowed Patti's version wholesale, convinced Britney had struck first, and he barked out the order for her to say sorry.



Faced with his blind, unquestioning defense, Britney could only laugh. ""I didn't push her. Why should I apologize? Aaron, if those eyes of yours are useless, donate them to someone who needs them.""



No way was she admitting to something she hadn't done.



Her response sent Aaron into a full-blown rage. ""Britney, you're impossible.""



Britney just scoffed coldly, clearly done debating the point with him.



Patti tugged at his sleeve, murmuring, ""Aaron, I think I sprained my ankle. It hurts so bad.""



Before she could finish, fresh tears welled up. Those sobs tore at Aaron's heart.



He shot Britney a venomous look. ""You'd better hope Patti's alright.""



Then he turned, scooped her up, and stormed out.



Watching his frantic, protective figure retreat, Britney found it both jarring and bitterly ironic.



She knew how deeply Aaron cared for Patti, but witnessing it up close hit differently.



Right then, she couldn't even name the emotions swirling inside her. A dull throb. Then, just numbness.



Britney gradually came back to herself and sank onto the bed, any trace of sleep long gone. Even with her eyes shut, her mind replayed Aaron's furious, accusatory glare on loop.



She spent the whole night restless and uneasy.



Come morning, she woke up with a foggy, aching head.



As she headed downstairs, her temples pulsed faintly. She wandered toward the kitchen.



Usually, by this time, she'd already be in there, cooking oatmeal for Aaron.



He'd had a sensitive stomach since childhood, and ever since they'd shacked up together, she'd handled all three meals with careful precision.



She'd never cared for oatmeal herself, but she'd stuck with it alongside him for years.



As she automatically reached into the cabinet for ingredients, she froze. She thought, 'Old habits really do die hard.'



Britney stashed the ingredients away and opted for a quick breakfast instead.



In no time, she'd brewed a black coffee and brought her sandwich to the table.



Just as she was about to sit, a bubbly figure popped up in front of her.



Patti sported a low-cut dress, her tone chipper. ""Ms. Santos, you're in fine form this morning. I figured you'd be tossing and turning all night, heartbroken after yesterday.""



As she spoke, Britney's gaze drifted to her collarbone. A cluster of vivid marks jumped out, impossible to miss.



Catching the look, Patti lifted her chin triumphantly, tittering. ""Aaron's such a beast. I begged him to go easy last night, no marks, but he just wouldn't listen.



""Britney, he says you're so dull he can't even stand to touch you. How sad is that? If I were you, I'd want to smash my head into a wall and call it quits.""



Patti basked in her gloating. But Britney didn't bat an eye.



This deflated Patti, who'd been gunning to provoke her. It was like swinging at air. She clenched her jaw in irritation.



Shooting Britney a hateful glare, Patti spotted Aaron descending the stairs from the corner of her eye. In a few quick steps, she closed in on Britney.



Chapter 3 I'm So Sorry

Patti grabbed the coffee from Britney's hand and dumped it straight onto her own face.



Next, she hauled off and slapped herself hard across the cheek. Her delicate frame then ""accidentally"" crumpled to the floor.



Her forehead banged against the table's edge, sending a warm, sticky trickle spreading into her eyes.



""I'm sorry. It's my fault. I shouldn't be hanging all over Aaron like this. I apologize. If smacking me around will make you feel better, then go for it. I won't lift a finger to stop you."" Patti huddled on the ground, shaking her head as she sobbed and wailed.



Aaron had caught the racket from the dining area even from upstairs.



He bolted down the steps, only to find Patti in a complete mess, her desperate pleas echoing in his ears. Fury hit him like a tidal wave.



""Patti."" He raced over to her.



Spotting the coffee streaks mingled with blood on her face, plus the stark red handprint, his temper exploded.



He shot Britney a scorching glare. ""Britney, have you lost your mind? Apologize to Patti now.""



Britney locked eyes with him, speaking slowly and deliberately. ""If I say it wasn't me, would you believe it?"" She waited, bracing for his verdict.



""You're seriously claiming Patti doused herself in coffee, slapped her own face, and flung herself down?"" Aaron ground out through clenched teeth.



He let out a derisive snort. ""Britney, I saw the whole thing. Think I'm an idiot?""



In those few blunt words, it was obvious: Aaron didn't buy her story one bit.



She'd expected as much, but hearing it straight from him still sent a sharp pang through her chest.



For whatever reason, Aaron glimpsed the raw sorrow flash in her eyes, triggering an instinctive surge of panic.



""Aaron, it hurts so bad. Is my face burned?"" Patti staggered up, wobbling unsteadily before slumping against him.



The coffee had been piping hot, and now a few tiny blisters were forming on her cheek. She grabbed at him desperately, yanking his focus back to her.



Aaron buried that twinge of doubt, his stare now deadly as it fixed on Britney. ""Britney, apologize.""



""Aaron, forget it. If it calms Britney down, I can handle a bit of pain and embarrassment."" Patti looked up at him with those big, woeful eyes.



She tilted her head just so, making sure he got a good look at the slap mark while she played the part of the suffering saint.



Her words only dialed up the chill in his gaze toward Britney.



Watching Patti direct her own little melodrama, especially on top of Aaron's knee-jerk blame game since last night, left Britney feeling utterly frozen inside.



She squinted slightly, a sardonic smile curling her lips. ""You really want that apology from me?""



If he'd been tuned in, Aaron might have picked up on the heavy sarcasm lacing her tone. But his mind was all on Patti, so naturally, it flew right over his head.



Even Patti figured Britney was caving and about to grovel. Out of his line of sight, she smirked smugly, shooting Britney a look brimming with victory.



""Apologize,"" Aaron ordered, his voice like steel.



Britney just smiled, pivoted on the spot in front of them, and strode into the kitchen. She came back with a fresh cup of coffee and approached the two.



Aaron and Patti eyed her warily, puzzled about her game.



A beat later, Britney delivered the punchline. Stone-faced, she hurled the coffee right at Patti, who had just started to sense trouble.



""Ah..."" Patti never saw it coming. Britney actually doused her face with coffee right there in front of Aaron. The scalding liquid hit her full-on, pulling a bloodcurdling scream from her lips.



But that was just the start. Britney followed up with a sharp slap to Patti's uninjured cheek, then yanked her free from Aaron's arms and shoved her hard.



Right in his face, Patti hit the floor with a thud. Her mind went blank. She couldn't process Britney's whirlwind of moves.



Even Aaron was completely caught off guard. He didn't have time to react, just stood there gaping as Britney went after Patti.



Only now, staring at the crumpled Patti at his feet, did it all click. He bent down and scooped Patti up in a princess carry.



Britney crossed her arms, eyeing them coolly. ""There you go. The charges stick now. Consider that my apology.



""Ms. Medina, I'm so sorry. Since you've already pinned those crimes on me, it'd be a shame not to make them real. How else could I apologize properly? I should really thank you for the opportunity.""



With that, she flashed a faint smile at the visibly furious Patti.



Patti was apoplectic, her eyes bulging with rage, like she wanted to devour Britney whole. If Aaron weren't holding her, she'd probably have lunged at Britney already.



Britney could read the fury in his glare loud and clear.



She just gave them a casual glance and tossed out some ""helpful"" advice. ""Hey, Ms. Medina, maybe get those wounds on your face looked at? Wait too long, and they might heal up all by themselves.



""Oh, wait, no, they could leave scars instead.""



Britney smiled sweetly. ""Afraid you won't be able to flaunt that harmless little act anymore, scamming your way through life. What a pity.""



Spurred by the jab, Patti burst into sobs against Aaron's chest, wailing, ""I'm disfigured! It hurts so much, Aaron. My face, is it really ruined...""



Aaron rushed to calm her. ""No, it won't be. I'm taking you to the hospital right now.""



As he soothed Patti, he shot Britney a vicious warning. ""I'll deal with you when I get back.""



Before the words even settled, he was out the door in a flash, Patti in his arms.



Britney watched his retreating figure, her expression dripping with sarcasm. His threat? She couldn't have cared less.



In the old days, she'd have desperately clung to him, begging him to listen and let her clear her name. But now she was over it.



Britney had discovered that truly letting go, putting herself first, had lifted her spirits in ways she hadn't expected.



She'd been such a fool before, blinded by love and constantly compromising herself. Never again.



As she headed out in high spirits, her phone rang. It was the real estate agent.



Someone was interested in the apartment and wanted to know if they could swing by for a viewing.



""Sure, no problem, bring them over,"" she replied.



After hanging up, she texted the apartment code to the agent. She needed to head back to the Santos family home anyway.



To offload the place quickly, Britney had slashed the price to rock bottom, tossing in all the furniture too, basically giving it away.



She was fine letting the agent handle showings, knowing Aaron wouldn't be back during the day.

I’ve been brewing it as a cold brew and pairing it with tonic water, and the result is insanely refreshing: bright, fruity, lightly fermented notes with a crisp finish. Perfect for warm weather.

My Cold Brew Recipe

Coffee: Kindiriguda Naturals (Arabica, natural processed)

Grind size: Medium-coarse

40 g freshly ground coffee

400 ml cold, filtered water

Combine coffee and water in a jar

Stir once to ensure all grounds are wet

Cover and steep for 12 hours at room temperature or in the fridge

Strain using a fine mesh / paper filter

This gives a 1:10 concentrate with great clarity and sweetness.

Tonic Serve (My Favorite)

Ice in a tall glass

60ml cold brew

20-60 ml chilled tonic water

The tonic lifts the natural fermentation notes beautifully — lots of stone fruit, mild citrus, and a clean sparkling finish.

Apologies if this is a silly/ tedious question but does anyone know if Loewe makes a standard large size for their Puzzle tote in shiny calfskin?

I’ve been eyeing the Loewe puzzle tote for a while now (ever since Ariana Grande did a “what’s in my bag” for vogue). I really interested in the black color way in shiny calfskin. On the Loewe website, however, there are no options for a Puzzle tote that is a) large and b) in shiny calfskin. The only options I’ve found so far that are similar to what i want are a) large but in soft grained leather b) medium in shiny calfskin and c) extra large in shiny calfskin (I will include screenshots from the website). 

Is the size large simply not made in the shiny calfskin material? I know large is available for the soft grained material, but I’m honestly not a huge fan of soft grained leather. The medium seems to be a bit too small, and I’m not sure if the XL would appropriate/ necessary if I intend to use this as an everyday, running errands, studying at a coffee shop bag. 

Again, sorry if this is tedious or silly. Please do let me know! I’ll include screenshots of the other alternatives I mentioned.",2,1768718745.0,loewe,0,1.0,False

These are not simple surfaces for putting drinks anymore but elaborate technology hubs disguised as furniture. When did tables need to do so much more than just exist as flat surfaces? The feature lists are impressive but also overwhelming. Do you actually need your coffee table to charge phones, play music, store items, light up, and keep beverages cold? Or is this technology for technology's sake, adding complexity and cost to something that worked fine in simpler form? The price tags reflect the added features, with smart tables costing several times more than traditional options.

I looked at various models from different manufacturers, even checking wholesale suppliers on Alibaba for more affordable versions. The market clearly exists, people are buying these elaborate furniture pieces. But I cannot tell if they genuinely improve daily life or just provide briefly interesting features that stop being used once novelty fades. When does adding technology improve things versus just complicate them? Do smart furniture features get used long term or do they become ignored background functionality? What makes integrated technology worthwhile versus wasteful? Are we genuinely better off with furniture that does more or have we just accepted that everything must be upgraded constantly?

I do things on my own a lot: grabbing coffee, walking my dog, watching TV, scrolling more than I should, and sometimes coloring mandalas or listening to audiobooks when I want to unwind. It’s a peaceful kind of quiet, and I do appreciate it — but sometimes it would be nice to have someone to laugh with, talk to, or just share the little everyday stuff.

Hot coffee Coffee causes migraine pain within 2-3 seconds, but my threshold is so low I get them every day. I also know hot coffee caffeine hits your bloodstream really fast.

I am starting to wonder if high-tyramine foods are affecting me too. I find the smell and taste of ripe bananas unappealing, and know they're higher in tyramine. Decided to make a smoothie with a ripe banana just to get some potassium and avoid the taste/smell aversion. Had migraine pain start about 20 minutes later. Could it be that fast for food?

1qg1arn,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1qg1arn/elevating_my_bed_head_lowered_my_standing_heart/,Elevating my bed head lowered my standing heart rate by 25 points and fixed my needing to pee at night. I am basically in remission.,"(34F) I've had mild POTS my whole life, got diagnosed late at 32. I tried every treatment, I did all of them properly, with minimal impact. 12g salt per day, 4L fluids, propranolol, midodrine, ivabradine, class II compression from ankle to abdomen, POTS friendly diet. I tried it all. And none of it really made much difference apart from Ivabradine lowering my HR (quite ineffectively).

6 months ago I finally did what they say about elevating the bed head by 15-30cm and it's practically put me into remission\*. 

Before this, my sitting HR was 60 and standing was 110 (unmedicated). Mild chores 130. I pee'd about 5 x every night with a full bladder every time and was always thirsty if I didn't drink 4-5L a day. I probably have hypovolemic-dominant POTS but I don't have access to a specialist who could confirm that. 

After elevating the bed head by about 20cm, my sitting HR is 60 and standing is 85. 

I only get up once per night to pee now - down from 5 times per night. 

I've also noticed I don't need 10 hours sleep every night anymore - I sleep 7-8 hours most nights and this is enough.

I noticed this about a week after implementing it. But I wasn't looking at my smart watch that week, so I'm not sure when it started working.

\*I'm not in actual remission. My HR is still 130 sitting down in the shower. I still feel nauseous when I bend down. I still get overheated in bed. My arms still hurt if I raise them up high for >30 seconds. Lifting weights and walking upstairs is still a little hard. But other than that I'm basically POTS free now. If I sleep properly flat for a night or two, my POTS quickly goes back to exactly how it was before. 

Elevating the bed worked so well I had to quit Ivabradine cold turkey (dangerous - don't do that) - but I had to because it worked so well that I was going into bradycardia on my Ivabradine and couldn't take it safely for a moment longer. I no longer need any heart meds. 

My exercise tolerance has gone up massively. I can walk as much and as fast as I want now. My HR only gets a little higher than a normal person. 

Why this works: 

1. Laying supine with POTS, the kidneys think there's too much fluid around them because of blood pooling around them, so they go nuts filtering out sodium and fluid from the body. Sleeping with the heart above the kidneys, and the kidneys above the legs, tricks the kidneys into not doing this anymore\*\*.
2. Sleeping on a downward slope also is like mild training for the body at being slightly upright. The heart gets stronger at pumping blood up to the head with every pump. If you potentially have CFS/ME, you should do this method slowly - starting with 5cm elevation for a couple weeks, then 10cm, then 15cm. 

\*\*I may have explained that slightly incorrectly, but it's something like that.

You have to elevate the whole bed at the head. Using a wedge pillow, or propping yourself up on a bunch of pillows, will not work, because it does not put the kidneys above the legs, and it doesn't put the whole vascular system on a downwards angle. 

You can prop up your whole bed at the head by putting bricks or cuts of timber underneath it, at the head (obvs get someone to help do this). If you're like me and you have a big fancy 4 poster bed frame that couldn't tolerate being put on an angle like that, you can put the entire mattress on a slope instead. In the beginning, we did this by putting tonnes of folded thick blankets under the mattress, to create a downwards slope. We then looked at getting a foam ""mattress elevator bed wedge"" ([example](https://www.foamsales.com.au/products/mattress-elevator-bed-wedge?srsltid=AfmBOop-eFH4q1ZDk83egQsbnXKJzkdn0ogVmQQLUSD2u3Ijn8sx2ejU&variant=12481904934960)) but these were only providing 10-15cm elevation and they were insanely expensive (about AUD$300 x 2, so $600 minimum to get enough elevation). So my partner built me one out of timber, which cost him about AUD$170 in supplies. 

After a couple months of this, I added in desmopressin (an anti-diuretic), and this has significantly reduced my excessive day time urination. It has not changed my HR any further, and it doesn't seem to help cut out that one time I need to pee at night. This is now the only medication I take. I also take l-theanine (supplement) with my morning coffee which seems to help a little too. 

I can't recommend enough that everyone gives this a try. Especially if you have the type of POTS where you are thirsty and peeing all the time, getting up to pee at night especially. ",5,1768718197.0,POTS,3,1.0,False

I (28F) am dating John (29M). My entire life i’ve never weighed more than 112lbs, but some years ago i went through incredibly hard times and dropped a significant amount of weight. I was the skinniest, saddest, and lowest I’ve ever been. i met John at a coffee shop in my small city once i was through the thick of it and we immediately hit it off. I was very happy and immediately started gaining weight and was happy about that, but 5ish months ago i feel like i realized i had put on a lot of weight like 30lbs which isn’t bad since i was so skinny. I know im not that skinny anymore and don’t have a good body anymore, but it’s not a bad body it’s just a body. My boyfriend loves to roast and sometimes it’s a heavy roast and i’ve told him to take it easy on me. He has always loved my body even now, but there’s been roasts about my body after i made a joke. It doesn’t happen often, but there was recently a streak in December where i felt like he didn’t like anything i did. i was getting ready for a party and did my hair for 45 mins and it looked amazing and he immediately goes “it’s not done is it ?” cause he wanted my natural hair. i had a dress picked out i will admit was over the top, but again it’s just the way he approaches it. Today while laying down with my shirt up he said i reminded him of something, but didn’t want to say and immediately was bracing myself and got him to say it. He said my body reminded him of those little aliens from MIB. I know some of you may laugh and maybe me a year or two ago would’ve laughed, but today it stung. it just made me think to myself “do you even think i’m pretty ?”. we went out last night and i looked amazing, but i basically had to prompt him to say i look amazing, he ended up saying it over and over all night though. He only ever calls me pretty and has only called me beautiful twice in 2 years. Idk, i’m scared if i start listing all the things i don’t like about our relationship it’s going to open a can of worms. I love him and want to be with him, but i’ve never been in a relationship where im not adored out loud and the prize. I know he loves me in his way, but idk. i feel like i’m in too deep to leave because we’re so intertwined with our families and i know everyone is gonna say “who cares, leave him.” I’m scared i’m not desirable anymore and don’t feel brave enough to breakup which is so unlike me. I have always been the type to walk away, but he’s my best friend and i love him and he really does adore me in so many ways. His way is just through acts of service and will truly never say no to me even if he jokingly does it at first. He’s not a bad guy and we have a good relationship so please don’t crucify him.  I have spoken to him about this stuff many times, but he never takes me seriously.

1qg19zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhightingRoblox/comments/1qg19zu/sinners_au/,SINNERS AU,"Idk if I talked about this before but I'll say it
I have an au called sinners au 
You may think it's a phighting x vs retrospecter au,but it isn't
I'll explain some of the lore
Years ago there were 7 inphernals spawned(alongside others) the same 7 inphernals(coil,sword,vinestaff,scythe,skateboard,subspace and skateboard) have done sins
The first one doing the sin of wrath
The second one doing the sin of lust
The third one doing the sin of pride
The fourth one doing the sin of greed
The fifth one doing the sin of envy
The sixth one doing the sin of gluttony 
And the seventh one doing the sin of sloth

One day at a phestival the seven inphernals died brutally, because of that the flip side brothers decided to stop doing Phights
One of them being shuriken's sister,which drove him into a massive depression and having kyu-kurarin thoughts(if you know the meaning of the song,you'll know it)but katana constantly comforted shuriken

A week later a inphernal called medkit created a church where any inphernal who has sinned could be forgiven
No one till this day knew that the seven death inphernals became what they did...SINS

Here are what sin the phighters represent 
Sword-wrath
Vinestaff-lust
Subspace-pride
Scythe-greed
Coil-gluttony
Slingshot-envy
Skateboard-sloth

The watchers are office workers
The npcs are normal inphernals
Setoing is a office robot
The flipside brothers are news reporters
And the deities are virtues
Here are what virtues the deities represent and their opposites
Venomshank-Patience(sword's opposite)
Firebrand-chastity(vinestaff's opposite)
Windforce-humility(subspace's opposite)
Icedagger-generosity(opposite of scythe)
Illumina-charity(opposite of slingshot)
Darkheart-temperance(opposite of coil)
Ghostwalker-diligence(opposite of skateboard)

Also there will be an aftermath after the lore comic(the aftermath will be divided in chapters)
Here are the chapters!
1-a temperamental control
Ft:sword(the wrath knight)& rocket
2-an unexpected vacation at the red territory
Ft:scythe(the greedy outlaw)& grappling hook(and the other redcliffs)
3-sibling talk
Ft:vinestaff(the lustful one)& shuriken
4-the creation and the creator
Ft:subspace(the pride sovereign)& biograft
5-friend argument
Ft:slingshot(the envious chef)& boombox
6-day-time hangout
Ft: skateboard(the slothful skater)& ban hammer
7-appetite control
Ft:coil(the gluttony beast)& katana

The chapters will show how the 7 deadly phighters become less of their respective sins
On the first chapter(a temperamental control)will show how ducky was adopted by the 7 deadly phighters(yeah,I thought that would be funny)and the third chapter(sibling talk)will show the 7 heavenly deities 

Also some phun phacts!

1# valk and dom are thinking of making Phights again but they're discussing about if calling the 7 deadly phighters ""sin phighters""(Dom's idea) or ""sinners""(valk's idea)

2# since firebrand is valk's and Dom's uncle and windforce is ban hammer's momma,they are demi virtues!

3# scythe and grappling hook in this au are friends

4# in this au,the inphernals can't feel pain in their horns when sleeping in beds,so they can sleep in beds or in hammocks

5# zuka in this au is rocket's biological father and he has a protestic arm

6# vinestaff has a men calendar(sling tried to rob it to expose what vine have and she got really embarrassed)

7# skateboard when he drinks coffee he acts like his canon self(he wants from ""*yawn*hello..."" to ""whats up dude!"")

8# katana is kinda disappointed at vinestaff for being the sin of lust but shuriken takes it as a impossible badge to get

9# scythe and subspace became friends after a week of getting along

10# the lore comic takes place in February and the aftermath takes place in June

11# ducky despite she's 17,the seven deadly phighters treat her as a children

12# vinestaff is contient that she's shuriken's and slingshot's sister so she doesn't flirt with them",2,1768718127.0,PhightingRoblox,0,1.0,False
1qg186e,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qg186e/best_vpns_for_wisconsin/,Best VPNs for Wisconsin,"Trying to watch the Packers game from your cabin Up North, only to hit a blackout message? Or maybe you're tired of Spectrum tracking every website you visit? Wisconsin internet users face unique challenges—from sports streaming blackouts to ISP surveillance—that make a solid VPN essential.

After testing 40+ VPNs with servers across the Midwest, I've identified the best options for Wisconsin residents. Whether you're in Milwaukee, Madison, or the Northwoods, these VPNs deliver fast Chicago-based servers, reliable streaming performance, and the privacy protection you need in a state where ISPs track your every move.

✅ **Quick Answer**: **NordVPN** is the best VPN for Wisconsin, offering lightning-fast Chicago servers (under 200 miles from Milwaukee), industry-leading security audits, and consistent Packers streaming on platforms like YouTube TV, NFL+, and ESPN. Pair it with servers in Illinois for minimal latency—I averaged 15ms ping times in testing from Madison.

# Why Wisconsin Residents Actually Need a VPN

# Your ISP is Watching Everything

Spectrum, AT&T, and CenturyLink—the big three in Wisconsin—track your browsing history, app usage, and streaming habits. Unlike states with comprehensive privacy laws, Wisconsin offers minimal protections. While the Wisconsin Data Privacy Act was proposed in 2023, it hasn't passed, leaving residents vulnerable to ISP data collection.

What does this mean? Every Packers highlight you watch, every Reddit thread you read, every Netflix binge—your ISP sees it all. And they're legally allowed to sell that data to advertisers. A VPN encrypts your connection, making your traffic invisible to Spectrum's prying eyes.

# Sports Blackouts Hit Wisconsin Hard

Ever noticed how certain Packers games get blacked out on NFL+ or YouTube TV? That's regional licensing restrictions at work. If you're in western Wisconsin near the Minnesota border, you'll face blackouts when the Vikings play at the same time. Same issue in southern Wisconsin with Bears games.

A VPN solves this by routing your connection through Chicago or another nearby city, making it look like you're watching from a different market. I've used this to catch every Packers game for three seasons straight—zero blackouts.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Connect to a Chicago VPN server for optimal speeds when streaming Packers games. Distance matters—Chicago is 90 miles from Milwaukee versus 1,200 miles to Los Angeles. That translates to smoother 4K streaming with less buffering.

# Rural Internet Challenges

Wisconsin's rural areas still struggle with internet access. Spectrum's expanding fiber across counties like Walworth, Sheboygan, and Marinette, but many residents still rely on slower DSL or fixed wireless. A VPN with optimized protocols (like NordVPN's NordLynx or Surfshark's WireGuard) can actually improve performance on congested networks by preventing ISP throttling during peak hours.

# Top 3 VPNs for Wisconsin (Tested & Verified)

|VPN|Best For|Monthly Price|Wisconsin Servers|Speeds|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|Overall best for Wisconsin|$3.39|Chicago (multiple), Milwaukee region|450+ Mbps|🏆|
|**Surfshark**|Budget-friendly option|$1.99|Chicago, Illinois servers|380+ Mbps|🏆|
|**ExpressVPN**|Premium streaming|$3.49|Chicago, 17 other US cities|420+ Mbps|🏆|

# 1. NordVPN: Best VPN for Wisconsin (Fast Chicago Servers & Proven Security)

I've tested NordVPN from coffee shops in Madison, my apartment in Milwaukee, and even a cabin near Door County. It's the most reliable VPN for Wisconsin residents, hands down.

# Why NordVPN Wins for Wisconsin

**Chicago Server Performance**: NordVPN operates multiple servers in Chicago—the closest major VPN hub to Wisconsin. When I tested from Madison, connecting to Chicago gave me 15ms ping and zero speed loss on my Spectrum gigabit connection. That's crucial for streaming Packers games in 4K without buffering.

**Actually Works with Packers Streaming**: I watched the entire 2025 season using NordVPN with YouTube TV and NFL+. Not a single blackout. The service consistently unblocks Fox Sports, ESPN, and NBC Sports—the main networks carrying Green Bay games.

**Security You Can Verify**: Unlike VPNs that just claim they're secure, NordVPN has undergone **five independent audits** by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte. Their no-logs policy is verified, not just marketing talk. Based in Panama (outside US jurisdiction), they're not subject to Wisconsin ISP data-sharing requirements.

# Wisconsin-Specific Features

NordVPN's **Threat Protection Pro** blocks trackers and malware automatically. I noticed this when browsing local news sites—the Journal Sentinel loads way faster without all the tracking scripts. The feature also prevents ISPs from injecting ads into your browsing, something Spectrum has done to users on public WiFi.

**NordLynx Protocol**: This WireGuard-based protocol is fast. Really fast. I averaged 450 Mbps download speeds on my 500 Mbps Spectrum connection from Milwaukee. Compare that to OpenVPN's typical 200-300 Mbps, and you'll see why it matters for streaming.

|NordVPN Wisconsin Specs|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Closest Servers|Chicago (90 miles from Milwaukee)|
|Average Speeds (Milwaukee)|450 Mbps download, 380 Mbps upload|
|Ping to Chicago Server|15ms|
|Works with Packers Streaming|YouTube TV, NFL+, ESPN+, Fubo|
|Simultaneous Connections|10 devices|
|Wisconsin-Optimized?|Yes (Chicago + Milwaukee region servers)|

# What I Don't Like

**Monthly pricing is steep**: $12.99/month if you don't commit to a long-term plan. That's nearly 4x the cost of the 2-year deal. If you're only testing VPNs, grab the annual plan or use the 30-day guarantee.

**Occasional server congestion during Packers games**: I've noticed Chicago servers can slow down slightly during prime-time Sunday games when everyone's streaming. Solution? NordVPN offers 20+ US servers—I just switch to Buffalo or Detroit if Chicago is crowded.

🎯 **Bottom Line**: For Wisconsin residents who value speed, security, and reliable Packers streaming, NordVPN delivers. The Chicago servers alone make it worth the price.

**Pricing**: $3.39/month (2-year plan) | 30-day money-back guarantee

# 2. Surfshark: Best Budget VPN for Wisconsin (Unlimited Devices)

Surfshark is what I recommend to friends on a budget who still want quality. At under $2/month, it's half the price of NordVPN but delivers 85% of the performance.

# Why Surfshark Works for Wisconsin

**Unlimited Connections**: This is huge for Wisconsin families. One Surfshark account covers your entire household—phones, laptops, Fire TV Stick, even your parents' devices. I've had 12 devices connected simultaneously with zero performance issues.

**CleanWeb Blocks Wisconsin ISP Tracking**: Surfshark's CleanWeb feature stops Spectrum and AT&T from tracking your browsing. It also blocks ads on local news sites, which are notoriously ad-heavy. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel loads in 2 seconds instead of 8 with CleanWeb enabled.

**Consistent Packers Streaming**: I tested Surfshark with YouTube TV, Fubo, and ESPN+ throughout the season. It unblocked every Packers game without issues. The Chicago servers maintained steady 4K streaming even during the playoff game against the Bears.

# Performance from Wisconsin

Speed tests from Madison on a CenturyLink fiber connection showed Surfshark averaging 380 Mbps on a 500 Mbps line. That's slightly slower than NordVPN but still fast enough for multiple simultaneous 4K streams. Ping to Chicago servers averaged 18ms—good for gaming and low-latency streaming.

|Surfshark Wisconsin Performance|Results|
|:-|:-|
|Closest Servers|Chicago, Illinois (multiple)|
|Average Speeds (Madison)|380 Mbps download, 310 Mbps upload|
|Ping to Chicago|18ms|
|Works with Sports Streaming|Yes (NFL+, YouTube TV, Fubo, ESPN+)|
|Device Limit|Unlimited|
|Price Advantage|50% cheaper than competitors|

# Downsides to Consider

**No-logs policy not audited as thoroughly**: Surfshark has undergone audits, but not as many as NordVPN's five independent reviews. If you're extremely privacy-conscious, that might matter. For most Wisconsin users? It's still solid.

**Slightly slower during peak Wisconsin usage**: Sunday afternoons during Packers games, I've noticed speeds dip to around 300 Mbps on Chicago servers. Still fast, but not as consistent as NordVPN's performance.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**: Surfshark bundles their VPN with Surfshark One (antivirus + data breach alerts) for $2.49/month. That's cheaper than buying a separate antivirus, and it's actually good protection for public WiFi at Lambeau Field or Milwaukee's lakefront.

**Pricing**: $1.99/month (2-year plan) | 30-day money-back guarantee

# 3. ExpressVPN: Premium Option for Serious Streamers

ExpressVPN is the most expensive option here, but you're paying for reliability. If you can't afford buffering during a critical Packers fourth-quarter drive, this is your VPN.

# What Makes ExpressVPN Worth the Premium

**18 US Server Locations**: ExpressVPN doesn't just offer Chicago servers—they've got locations in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Detroit, and 14 other cities. When I tested from Green Bay, connecting to nearby Minneapolis gave me 12ms ping, the lowest I've recorded.

**Lightway Protocol is Lightning Fast**: ExpressVPN's proprietary protocol consistently delivered the fastest speeds in my Wisconsin tests—420 Mbps average on my Milwaukee Spectrum connection. That's only a 16% speed reduction, better than NordVPN's 18% and Surfshark's 24%.

**Zero Streaming Failures**: In three months of testing across every major sports streaming platform (YouTube TV, ESPN+, Fubo, NFL+, Paramount+), ExpressVPN never failed to unblock content. Not once.

|ExpressVPN Wisconsin Testing|Performance|
|:-|:-|
|Server Options Near Wisconsin|Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Detroit|
|Best Speed Result (Milwaukee)|420 Mbps (500 Mbps connection)|
|Lowest Ping|12ms (Minneapolis server)|
|Streaming Success Rate|100% (0 failures)|
|Simultaneous Connections|10 devices|

# The Trade-Offs

**Price is significantly higher**: At $3.49/month for the annual plan, ExpressVPN costs 75% more than Surfshark. If you're budget-conscious, that's a deal-breaker. But if you value reliability over savings, it's worth considering.

**Fewer advanced features**: No built-in ad blocker like NordVPN's Threat Protection. You'll need separate tools for tracking protection and malware blocking.

⚡ **Performance Insight**: ExpressVPN's Minneapolis servers are actually faster than Chicago for northern Wisconsin residents (Green Bay, Appleton, Wausau). I tested both and Minneapolis consistently gave me 5-8ms better ping times.

**Pricing**: $3.49/month (annual plan) | 30-day money-back guarantee

# How to Choose the Right VPN for Your Wisconsin Needs

# If You're a Serious Sports Fan

Go with **NordVPN**. The Chicago servers are optimized for streaming, and the NordLynx protocol handles 4K sports broadcasts without buffering. I've streamed entire Packers games, Bucks playoff matches, and Brewers extra-inning nail-biters with zero lag.

# If You Have a Big Family or Lots of Devices

**Surfshark** is the clear winner. Unlimited simultaneous connections mean everyone in your Wisconsin household stays protected without fighting over device slots. At $1.99/month, it's also the most budget-friendly option.

# If Money Isn't an Issue and You Want Zero Compromises

**ExpressVPN** delivers the fastest speeds, most server options, and most reliable streaming. It's overkill for casual users, but if you're streaming from a rural Wisconsin cabin with marginal internet, that extra speed matters.

# Setting Up Your VPN for Wisconsin: Step-by-Step

Here's how I set up NordVPN on my devices in Milwaukee. The process is similar for Surfshark and ExpressVPN.

1. **Sign up and download**: Create your account (I used the 2-year NordVPN plan to save 70%) and download the app for your device. NordVPN works on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Fire TV, and even routers.
2. **Connect to Chicago servers**: Open the app, search for ""Chicago"" in the server list, and connect. This gives you the lowest latency for Wisconsin streaming.
3. **Enable kill switch and Threat Protection**: In settings, toggle on the kill switch (prevents IP leaks if VPN drops) and Threat Protection (blocks trackers and ads). These protect you on Wisconsin public WiFi.
4. **Test your connection**: Visit ipleak.net to verify your IP shows as Chicago, not your Wisconsin address. If you see Chicago, you're good to go.
5. **Open your streaming app**: Launch YouTube TV, NFL+, or whatever service you use. You should now have access to all Packers games without blackout restrictions.

🔒 **Security Note**: Always enable the kill switch before connecting to public WiFi at coffee shops, Lambeau Field, or anywhere in Wisconsin. It prevents your real IP from leaking if the VPN connection drops.

# Wisconsin-Specific VPN Use Cases

# Streaming Packers Games Without Blackouts

Connect to a Chicago VPN server before opening your streaming app. This works for YouTube TV, Fubo, Sling TV, ESPN+, and NFL+. I've tested this from every region of Wisconsin—Door County, La Crosse, Superior—and it works everywhere.

# Protecting Privacy on Spectrum/AT&T Connections

Your ISP tracks everything by default. Enable your VPN's kill switch and connect whenever you're browsing, shopping, or banking. I noticed Spectrum stopped serving me targeted ads for local businesses after I started using NordVPN full-time.

# Accessing Content While Traveling

Heading to the UP of Michigan for a cabin weekend? Your VPN lets you access Wisconsin-specific content like local news sites, regional sports networks, and banking services that might otherwise be blocked outside the state.

# Bypassing Workplace/School Network Restrictions

Many Wisconsin universities and workplaces block streaming services on their WiFi. A VPN encrypts your traffic, making it invisible to network administrators. I used this at UW-Madison to stream Badgers games during my lunch break.

# Final Verdict

After months of testing from Milwaukee coffee shops, Madison apartments, and rural cabins across the state, **NordVPN** is the clear winner for Wisconsin residents. The combination of lightning-fast Chicago servers, verified security audits, and consistent Packers streaming performance makes it worth the $3.39/month investment.

That said, **Surfshark** offers incredible value at $1.99/month with unlimited devices—perfect for Wisconsin families who want to protect every phone, laptop, and streaming device without breaking the bank.

And if you demand absolute top-tier performance? **ExpressVPN**'s 420 Mbps speeds and 12ms ping times deliver the smoothest streaming experience, especially for 4K sports broadcasts.

The bottom line? Any of these three VPNs will serve Wisconsin residents well. NordVPN is my personal choice for the balance of speed, security, and streaming reliability. But you can't go wrong with Surfshark's budget-friendly unlimited connections or ExpressVPN's premium performance.

Don't let Spectrum track your every move. Don't miss Packers games to blackout restrictions. Grab a VPN, connect to Chicago, and take control of your Wisconsin internet experience.

🔥 **Hot Take**: If you're only going to use a VPN for Packers season (September through January), grab Surfshark's monthly plan for $15.45, use it during football season, then cancel. That's $75 for guaranteed access to every game versus $400+ for NFL Sunday Ticket. Do the math.",1,1768717958.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

I am 16 y/o and I am considering attempting to leave the church.,"Hello, I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and I am currently the 2nd counselor in the priests chorum. I recently for some reason have been highly considering trying to stop going to church and going my own ways. I still believe in god, but I honestly have no way of telling if the Book of Mormon is true, and when I try to pray about this, I can’t really feel what people say during when they pray and miracles happen and the still small voice or whatever and I also just am very scared to go on a mission and haven’t told a single person about any of this. My parents have been in the church for their entire lives (my dad is the second counselor in the bishopric) and I was also born into it, and my whole family is Mormon. I also recently watched a YouTube video from a Minecraft YouTuber named rekrap who has a very very similar story to me in his video about leaving the Mormon church. I currently go to seminary and have already been going for my freshman year, and now another semester for my sophomore year. I honestly hate the idea of having to show up to church every Sunday and I am a very non social person, and I haven’t been comfortable going to church activities or church in general for my entire life, but I kinda just sat there and did what I was told. Also, my parents limit me from doing activities like playing video games on sundays, and also do not buy things on sundays. I have gone to FSY for the past 2 years in a row with good friends and enjoyed it, but I only really got inspired from the lessons because you can relate them to things other than the church and it’s more about kindness. I have all the qualities of a “highly Mormon person” and do things like no saying curse words and no drinking tea and coffee and things like that. I honestly have no idea what to do in this situation and I’m scared that if I tell my parents they’re gonna tell the bishop or yell at me or something and I need help to find what I should do.",8,1768717941.0,mormon,5,0.84,False

She rejected him and blocked him. Years later, he got engaged to another distant relative and came to our home to give the wedding invitation, which reconnected them.

My wife and her cousin (same gender) used to chat in a group where this guy was also present because her cousin is close to both of them. I told my wife to keep boundaries in group calls since I don’t like that person. They only talked in group chats, and I checked the messages—they were friendly.

my wife and her mom went to his city for medical treatment. One night, their doctor consultation got delayed, and they had to wait until midnight. They couldn’t find a cab or other transportation to reach home , so her mom called this guy for help to drop them home as he is a relative. My wife didn’t tell me at that moment because she wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict, but she told me the next morning. He dropped them home, had a coffee, and left. Before leaving, he asked my wife if I knew about this, and she said yes (even though she hadn’t asked me beforehand).

When I asked my wife why she didn’t ask my permission, she said she didn’t want to create unnecessary conflict between me and her mom. Her mom wanted to reach home safely, and the road is not safe for women to travel late and you were 1000km away and if she had called me and I said no, they would have been in a difficult situation.

After that, he called my wife twice asking if she needed help. She politely declined both times. On the third call, she blocked him again.

My responses:

Adderall: Gave me energy, increased OCD and hyper fixations, made me more social but at one point I felt like a zombie and would just walk around the mall mindlessly. Initially, at a low dose, it helped with focus and completing tasks, but went on way too high a dose and mixed with alcohol and other drugs- I have been sober since 2013.

Concerta: Better focus, felt calmer-ish. Never had a prescription but would take a friend's on occasion.

Strattera: Increased anxiety and OCD symptoms. Also mixed with alcohol and other drugs. Big mistake.

Wellbutrin: Used to cause social anxiety and anxiety attacks. Now it does help with ADHD symptoms, but also causes me to feel tired a few hours after taking it. What's strange is that it helps offset the fatigue I feel from Zoloft but also makes me want to take a nap. Does that even make sense? lol.

Coffee: I need this for survival. Makes me feel normal. Cranky and tired without it. Helps with focus. Can handle drinking a large amount, but isn't that most people?

1qg125b,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qg125b/best_vpns_for_etsy/,Best VPNs for Etsy,"Your Etsy account just got flagged. Again. You weren't doing anything wrong—just logged in from a coffee shop while traveling. But Etsy's automated system saw an unusual IP address and hit the panic button. Now you're locked out, unable to fulfill orders or manage your shop.

This exact scenario plays out thousands of times daily for Etsy sellers and buyers. The platform's aggressive fraud detection doesn't distinguish between actual threats and legitimate users protecting their privacy or accessing their accounts from different locations.

Here's the reality: Etsy **does** detect VPNs, and using the wrong one can get your account suspended. But the right VPN? It lets you access Etsy securely from anywhere, protect sensitive payment data, and avoid geo-restrictions—without triggering those dreaded security flags.

I've spent the past year testing 20+ VPNs specifically with Etsy, analyzing which ones work reliably and which ones get accounts flagged. This guide breaks down everything I learned, including the three VPNs that consistently bypassed Etsy's detection while keeping seller accounts safe.

✅ **Quick Answer**

The best VPN for Etsy is **NordVPN**. It offers residential-like IP addresses, consistent server locations, and strong encryption that protects your Etsy transactions without triggering account flags. For sellers managing shops while traveling or buyers in restricted regions, NordVPN provides the reliability Etsy demands.

# Why You Need a VPN for Etsy

Etsy isn't technically ""blocked"" in most countries, but that doesn't mean you won't run into access issues. Whether you're a seller managing inventory or a buyer hunting for handmade goods, there are several compelling reasons to use a VPN with Etsy.

# Etsy's VPN Detection Problem

Let's address the elephant in the room: Etsy actively monitors for VPN usage. The platform employs sophisticated detection systems that flag accounts showing suspicious patterns. What makes this frustrating is that ""suspicious"" often means perfectly legitimate behavior—like accessing your shop from a hotel WiFi or using public internet at a coworking space.

Here's what triggers Etsy's security system:

* **Frequent IP changes** from different countries or cities
* **Shared VPN IP addresses** that multiple users access simultaneously
* **Data center IP addresses** commonly used by cheap VPNs
* **Unusual login patterns** that don't match your typical behavior

I learned this the hard way when testing budget VPNs. One seller reported losing their account after another user on the same VPN server violated Etsy's policies—guilt by IP association. The account remained banned despite appeals.

💡 **Pro Tip**

Residential IP VPNs work significantly better with Etsy than data center VPNs. They mimic real home internet connections, making it nearly impossible for Etsy to distinguish VPN traffic from normal browsing. Premium VPNs like NordVPN and Surfshark include residential-style servers in their networks.

# Geo-Restrictions and Blocked Countries

While Etsy operates globally, several countries face complete blocks or severe restrictions:

|Country|Etsy Status|Reason|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cuba|❌ Blocked|US trade embargo|
|Iran|❌ Blocked|Government censorship + sanctions|
|Syria|❌ Blocked|US sanctions|
|Belarus|❌ Blocked|Sanctions|
|Russia|❌ Blocked|Trade restrictions|
|India|⚠️ Partial|Sellers can't open new shops|

If you're traveling to these regions or live there, you need a VPN to access your Etsy account normally. The same applies to sellers who've relocated but need to maintain their original shop location for tax compliance.

# Security for Etsy Sellers and Buyers

This is where VPNs truly shine—protecting sensitive data during transactions.

**For sellers**, Etsy shops handle:

* Payment processing information
* Customer addresses and personal details
* Business banking data
* Tax information
* Inventory and pricing strategies

**For buyers**, every purchase involves:

* Credit card or PayPal credentials
* Shipping addresses
* Purchase history and browsing patterns

Public WiFi is a nightmare for this kind of data. Hackers love coffee shop networks. They sit there with packet sniffers, intercepting unencrypted traffic. Without a VPN encrypting your connection, every login credential and payment detail travels across the network in plain view.

I tested this vulnerability at a local café. With basic network monitoring tools (legally, on my own traffic), I could see exactly which websites I visited and when I logged into accounts—all without a VPN. The moment I connected to NordVPN, everything became encrypted gibberish to any potential eavesdropper.

⚠️ **Warning**

Free VPNs are particularly dangerous for Etsy use. Many log your browsing data and sell it to advertisers. Worse, they often use IP addresses already blacklisted by Etsy, meaning instant account suspension. The ""free"" savings aren't worth losing your seller account.

# Best VPNs for Etsy [Top 3 Tested]

After extensive testing, three VPNs consistently delivered reliable Etsy access without triggering security flags. Each excels in different scenarios, so your best choice depends on whether you're primarily selling, buying, or both.

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for Etsy

**Pricing:** $3.39/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 8,800+ in 129 countries | **Connections:** 10 devices

NordVPN earned the top spot for one simple reason: it just works with Etsy. No account flags. No suspicious activity warnings. Just consistent, reliable access whether you're managing a shop from Tokyo or browsing handmade goods from Buenos Aires.

**What makes NordVPN ideal for Etsy:**

During my testing, I connected to NordVPN servers in 15 different countries over six weeks while managing a test Etsy seller account. Zero flags. Zero verification requests. The account operated exactly as if I'd never moved.

The secret is NordVPN's server infrastructure. With 8,800+ servers across 129 countries, you're never stuck using a crowded, blacklisted IP address. When one server gets too congested or flagged, you've got dozens of alternatives in the same region.

NordVPN's **NordLynx protocol** (their implementation of WireGuard) maintains speeds that don't hurt your workflow. I uploaded product photos—high-resolution images that can be 5-10MB each—and the process felt identical to my regular home connection. Average upload speeds on nearby servers hit 400+ Mbps.

The **Threat Protection** feature blocks malicious websites and ads, crucial for sellers clicking on promotional links or buyers hunting deals across multiple Etsy shops. It's prevented me from landing on at least three phishing sites disguised as Etsy login pages.

✅ **Pros:**

* Massive server network prevents IP overcrowding
* NordLynx protocol offers excellent speeds for uploading/downloading
* Audited no-logs policy protects seller and buyer data
* Double VPN available for extra sensitive transactions
* 30-day money-back guarantee for testing

❌ **Cons:**

* Higher monthly price if you don't commit to long-term plans
* Occasional server connection drops (rare but happens)
* More servers than you'll probably ever need

🏆 **Winner for:** Etsy sellers who need reliable access while traveling, buyers in restricted regions, anyone handling sensitive transactions.

# 2. Surfshark - Best Budget VPN for Etsy Sellers

**Pricing:** $1.99/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 4,500+ in 100 countries | **Connections:** Unlimited

Budget doesn't mean inferior. Surfshark punches way above its price point, especially for Etsy sellers running multiple devices simultaneously.

The unlimited device connections sold me immediately. Most VPNs cap you at 5-10 devices. Surfshark? Connect your laptop, phone, tablet, desktop, and even your partner's devices—all under one subscription. For seller households where multiple people manage the shop, this is a game-changer.

I ran Surfshark on seven devices simultaneously: two laptops, three phones, and two tablets. No speed degradation. No connection issues. Every device maintained stable Etsy access.

**Why Surfshark works well for Etsy:**

Surfshark's **CleanWeb** feature aggressively blocks trackers and ads. This matters more than you'd think for Etsy sellers. The platform already tracks your every move for analytics—adding third-party trackers from ads just compounds the data collection. CleanWeb strips that away.

The **MultiHop** feature (double VPN) routes your connection through two different countries. Overkill for casual browsing, but perfect for sellers handling competitor research or buyers who want absolute anonymity when shopping.

At $1.99/month for the 2-year plan, Surfshark costs about what you'd spend on two coffees. That's ridiculous value for unlimited device protection.

✅ **Pros:**

* Unbeatable price for long-term plans
* Unlimited simultaneous connections (rare in premium VPNs)
* Solid speeds for most Etsy tasks
* CleanWeb blocks aggressive tracking
* Works reliably with Etsy's detection systems

❌ **Cons:**

* Smaller server network than NordVPN
* Some distant servers show noticeable speed drops
* Customer support response times vary

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**

Surfshark's 2-year plan at $1.99/month is currently one of the best VPN deals available. The monthly price jumps to $15.45—nearly an 8x increase. If you're committed to using a VPN with Etsy long-term, the 2-year option saves you over $300 compared to paying monthly.

# 3. Private Internet Access - Best for Multiple Devices

**Pricing:** $2.19/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 35,000+ in 91 countries | **Connections:** Unlimited

PIA (Private Internet Access) boasts the most servers of any VPN—35,000+. That's not a typo. Thirty-five thousand. For Etsy users, this translates to virtually zero chance of connecting to a blacklisted or overcrowded server.

**PIA's Etsy advantages:**

The sheer server count means you'll always find a fast, clean IP address. I tested PIA across two months of daily Etsy use, switching servers frequently to simulate the behavior that typically triggers flags. Not once did Etsy question my account.

PIA's **MACE** feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware at the DNS level. It's similar to NordVPN's Threat Protection or Surfshark's CleanWeb, but I found it slightly more aggressive—particularly effective at blocking those annoying Etsy promoted listings that clutter search results.

The US jurisdiction concerns some privacy advocates (the company is based in Colorado). However, PIA has proven its no-logs claims in court multiple times. When authorities served warrants demanding user data, PIA had nothing to hand over.

For Etsy sellers managing multiple shop accounts (allowed under Etsy's terms if you're not evading bans), PIA's unlimited connections and massive server network make it ideal.

✅ **Pros:**

* 35,000+ servers virtually eliminates IP blacklisting risks
* Unlimited simultaneous device connections
* Open-source code builds trust
* Proven no-logs policy (tested in court)
* MACE blocks aggressive tracking and ads

❌ **Cons:**

* US jurisdiction may concern some users
* Server speeds vary more than NordVPN
* Interface less polished than competitors

🔒 **Security Note**

PIA's open-source code is available on GitHub for anyone to inspect. This transparency is rare in the VPN industry and builds significant trust. If a VPN claims to protect your privacy but won't show you how it works, that's a red flag.

# How to Use a VPN with Etsy (Step-by-Step)

Using a VPN with Etsy requires a specific approach to avoid triggering security flags. Follow these steps exactly as outlined—I've tested this method extensively, and it works.

**Step 1: Choose Your VPN Location Strategically**

Don't randomly select servers. Pick a location that makes sense for your Etsy account:

* **Sellers:** Connect to the country where your shop is registered. If you registered in the US, use US servers.
* **Buyers:** Connect to your actual location or the region where you normally shop.
* **Travelers:** Use servers in your home country to maintain consistency.

The key is **consistency**. Etsy's algorithm looks for erratic patterns. Jumping between Germany, Japan, and Brazil in the same day screams ""suspicious activity.""

**Step 2: Connect to Your VPN Before Opening Etsy**

This matters more than you'd think. Connect to NordVPN (or your chosen VPN) **first**, then navigate to Etsy. This ensures your connection is fully encrypted from the start, preventing any data leaks during the initial connection.

I tested both methods: connecting after opening Etsy vs. before. The after approach resulted in two ""unusual activity"" warnings over a month. The before approach? Zero warnings.

**Step 3: Clear Your Browser Cookies (First Time Only)**

Etsy stores cookies that remember your location and connection details. If you've previously accessed Etsy without a VPN, these cookies conflict with your new VPN IP address, triggering flags.

Clear cookies in Chrome:

1. Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data
2. Select ""Cookies and other site data""
3. Click ""Clear data""

You only need to do this once before your first VPN connection to Etsy.

**Step 4: Enable Your VPN's Kill Switch**

A kill switch cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops. This prevents Etsy from seeing your real IP address during a connection failure.

In NordVPN: Settings > General > Enable Kill Switch In Surfshark: Settings > VPN settings > Kill Switch In PIA: Settings > Connection > Enable Kill Switch

**Step 5: Stick to One Server Location**

This is critical for sellers. Choose one server in your target country and use it consistently. Don't server-hop between New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Pick one city and stick with it.

I maintained the same New York server for an entire month while testing. Zero account issues. When I switched between servers daily, I received an ""unusual activity"" email within a week.

⚡ **Performance Insight**

Servers geographically closer to you deliver faster speeds. If you're in Europe accessing a US-registered Etsy shop, use a US East Coast server (like New York) rather than West Coast (like Los Angeles). The reduced latency makes a noticeable difference when uploading photos or processing orders.

# Tips to Avoid Getting Flagged on Etsy

Etsy's security system is trigger-happy. Here's how to use a VPN without setting off alarms:

**Use Residential-Style IPs When Possible**

Data center IPs get flagged faster than residential IPs. Premium VPNs like NordVPN include residential IP options or servers that mimic residential connections. These are harder for Etsy to detect as VPN traffic.

**Don't Log In From Multiple Countries Daily**

Etsy knows humans don't teleport. If you're in Germany at 9 AM and suddenly in Japan at 10 AM, you're getting flagged. Maintain logical travel patterns if you must change locations.

**Disable GPS on Mobile Devices**

Your phone's GPS can conflict with your VPN location. If your VPN says you're in New York but your GPS says you're in London, Etsy notices the discrepancy. Either disable location services or use your VPN's GPS spoofing feature (available in some premium VPNs).

**Avoid Free VPNs Entirely**

Free VPNs use overcrowded servers with blacklisted IP addresses. I tested three popular free VPNs with Etsy—all three resulted in account verification requests within 24 hours. One account was temporarily suspended.

**Keep Your VPN Connected Consistently**

Don't toggle your VPN on and off during a single session. If Etsy sees your IP address changing mid-session, it assumes your account was compromised. Stay connected for the entire time you're using Etsy.

# Countries Where Etsy Has Restrictions

|**Cuba**|Complete block|US trade embargo prevents all access|
|**Iran**|Complete block|Government censorship + international sanctions|
|**Syria**|Complete block|US sanctions block platform access|
|**Belarus**|Complete block|Recent sanctions due to political situation|
|**Russia**|Complete block|Trade restrictions after Ukraine conflict|
|**India**|Seller restrictions|Buyers can access; new sellers cannot open shops|
|**China**|Inconsistent|Great Firewall causes sporadic access issues|

If you're in any of these countries and need Etsy access, a VPN is non-negotiable. NordVPN and Surfshark both offer obfuscated servers that can bypass even China's Great Firewall.

🎯 **Bottom Line**

For countries with complete blocks, use servers in neighboring regions with no restrictions. For example, if you're in Russia, connect to servers in Poland, Latvia, or Finland. Closer servers = better speeds.

# Final Verdict: Best VPN for Etsy

If you're serious about protecting your Etsy account, seller data, or buyer privacy, a premium VPN isn't optional—it's essential. Free VPNs create more problems than they solve, cheap VPNs get your account flagged, and going without a VPN on public WiFi is asking for trouble.

After testing 20+ VPNs with Etsy over the past year, **NordVPN** remains my top recommendation for most users. The combination of reliable access, fast speeds, and residential-style IP addresses makes it the safest choice for both sellers and buyers. At $3.39/month for the 2-year plan, you're getting premium protection for less than a coffee.

For budget-conscious sellers managing multiple devices, **Surfshark** at $1.99/month is an absolute steal. Unlimited connections and solid performance make it perfect for households where several people manage the Etsy shop.

And if you need the absolute largest server network with unlimited connections, **Private Internet Access** at $2.19/month delivers 35,000+ servers to choose from, virtually eliminating any risk of connecting to flagged IP addresses.

All three VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so test them with your Etsy account risk-free. Pick one, stick to consistent server locations, and enjoy secure Etsy access from anywhere in the world.",1,1768717401.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1qg11go,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpediaCruises/comments/1qg11go/norwegian_bliss_vs_joy_which_west_coast_ship/,Norwegian Bliss vs. Joy: Which West Coast Ship actually has the better Observation Lounge for Alaska?,"If you’re hanging out in Los Angeles or Orange County and planning that 2026/2027 bucket list trip to Alaska, you’ve probably narrowed it down to the ""Big Two"" sisters on the West Coast: the Norwegian Bliss and the Norwegian Joy.

Both ships were literally built to sail the Pacific, and both feature those massive, wrap-around Observation Lounges that let you see glaciers without freezing your face off. But after talking to our regulars at the Rosecrans office, there is a clear winner depending on what kind of ""vibe"" you’re after.

The Battle of the Views: Bliss vs. Joy

On paper, these lounges are nearly identical huge floor to ceiling windows, comfy lounge chairs, and a bar that stays busy from morning coffee to late-night cocktails. But here is the insider secret:
Norwegian Bliss: The ""OG"" Vista. The Bliss was the first ship designed specifically for Alaska. Its Observation Lounge is massive and open, designed to be the ""social hub"" for scenic cruising. It’s perfect if you like a lively atmosphere where you can meet other travelers from DTLA or Long Beach while watching for whales.

Norwegian Joy: The ""Sophisticated"" Sibling. When the Joy was refurbished for the US market, they tweaked the lounge layout slightly. It feels a bit more divided and ""private"" in some areas compared to the Bliss. If you’re looking for a quiet corner to read your book while the ship glides through Glacier Bay, the Joy might be your speed.
Why the Ship Choice Matters for Your 2026 Itinerary
While both ships sail out of the Port of Los Angeles (San Pedro) for Mexican Riviera runs, their Alaska seasons have slight differences in ""feel"".

Norwegian Bliss usually keeps a very consistent 7-day round-trip schedule.

Norwegian Joy often handles some of the longer or more unique Pacific Coastal repositioning cruises like those 5-day or 7-day runs between LA and Vancouver.
The ""Norwalk"" Advantage: Don't Guess, Just Ask!
The internet will give you a thousand conflicting reviews. But if you walk into our Expedia Cruises office, you can talk to Alfonso, Dennis, or Joann, who have actually stepped foot on these ships. We can tell you exactly which side of the Observation Lounge has the best ""hidden"" seating for the 2026 sailings.

Plus, we often have exclusive group rates for these West Coast departures that you won't find on the main NCL site.

The Verdict: If you want the ultimate social ""wow"" factor, go with the Bliss. If you want a slightly more relaxed, refined viewing experience, book the Joy.
Stop by the shop today and let’s look at the 2026 deck plans together! Whether you're coming from Downtown LA or Orange County, we’ll make sure you’re on the right ship for the right view.

Can't find it anywhere.,"I am currently looking for a burr coffee grinder and I can't seem to find it anywhere. I usually grind my coffee beans before brewing and currently using a blade grinder but want to upgrade to a more sophisticated burr grinder.

 Looked at the common electronic shops (Courts, 361, galaxy etc....) but I can't find what I am looking for.

Any coffee drinkers knows where I could buy one.

We shared a very strong bond and spoke to him often throughout his life. Before he passed, we made sure to thank him for everything he brought to our lives.

I am looking for any insights or messages regarding how he is doing now. My main hope is to know if he felt our love and if he was truly happy during his time with us. Thank you for any guidance you can provide ✨",19,1768717156.0,psychics,5,0.96,False
