1kr5u1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kr5u1y/how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_like_an_outlier_with/,How do you deal with feeling like an outlier with values and perspectives?,"I (M 29) am browsing through reddit often, through various subreddits, and lately also through AskMenAdvice. I noticed that I am often having views that most certainly are not mainstream by any means. Sometimes shockingly so. But I have also noticed this happening IRL too.

I would like to feel more connected with people, but sometimes it is hard when I experience a really glaring mismatch in values and perceptions of reality. Have you experienced this and how do you deal with this? I feel so often out-of-place... 

Here some examples from browsing this subreddit:

Culture Shock #1 
------------------------------

There was a post from a girl asking whether her having male friends was going to turn people off and if it were perceived as a red flag. 

The amount of people saying yes to that was overwhelming. 

I'd just be happy that she'd have a good social life going on and that she obviously knows how to have lasting relationships, albeit platonic, with men. 

I just see here so much insecurity; when another redditor called male friends ""dicks in a glas jar"", I felt extremely put off. Guys, you don't need a glas jar, if Walmart is across the street, ok? That's so incredibly derogatory towards people's intimate friendships. And it shows a lacking respect for friendship in general. 

And of course, it shows a certain entitledness or expectation that your future SO better have no male friends, so you don't have to feel threatened. Of course, you know it is an unreasonable ask, to say:

 ""Hey, your multiple year long friendships, break them off, and put your potential romantic connection on a hierarchical pedestal where I find I belong. Even though you just have known me for 3 coffee dates this is just my standard.""

So people call it a red flag and fuck off. Ok, suit yourself, you gotta do you. I just want to point out 50% are male and a socially desirable woman will have a social circle and some of those people will be male. 

It is not just men though, it is the same in reverse regarding women. Does it not piss you off?

Culture Shock #2 
-------------------------------

A post about a girl asking his bf whether it is okay to go on a vacation with her ex who invited her as a means to make amends for treating her badly before. 

Now my unpopular opinion: Just let her if she wants to, lmao. 

If somebody wants to cheat on you, they are going to cheat on you. With or without a vacation. You can't save somebody from a piss-poor decision if they want to be stupid. Have you tried keeping flees in a pen? Why bother? Instead, read a book or something... 

Considering this was a monogamous relationship (but honestly even if it was not), I'd start off by asking her whether she is asking for my permission and if I were her legal guardian, rejecting that I play the part of a decision maker from what she already knows will be a no from my POV.
And how she thought this would go? I'd tell her it makes my uncomfortable and that I think it would be a terrible decision. If her ex had a rotten personality, it will not have changed within half a year, and that they probably broke it off for reasons. But ultimately she'd have to make her own decision and I'd take note of it. 

But more in general, I don't get what the desired dynamics are. People seem to be getting into serially monogamous relationships, feeling like they should let loose in their younger years, but still commit to a monogamous relationship they know they are going to break off anyway (""just not the one"") not leaving  them neither with the advantages of a monogamous nor polyamorous relationship, but all the disadvantages of monogamy, 
and of course, all the arguably justified jealousy and relationship drama resulting from serial monogamy...  

Idk, why won't some people just go poly which will lead to healthier dynamics, less heartbreak, more honesty, etc if done elaborately. If your relationship is open, imho, you do not need to fear jealousy and cheating. You have room for adventure and room for intimacy without these constraining and artifical societal boxes and scripts. 

My advice would generally be, either go for monogamy or polyamory, but serial monogamy has to be hands down the worst relationship model. I don't understand why it is the societal mainstream. ",1,1747750250.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

Saw my doctor for follow up today per her requirement. She asked who prescribed Zepbound to me. I told her she did (she assumed it was my endocrinologist). She asked how much weight I’ve lost and I told her 7 pounds and she made it seem like this drug isn’t working for me. Asked me what I was eating, and when I mentioned granola in my Greek yogurt she told me to cut back on the carbs. She also told me to cut back on my 2 cups of coffee per day since I use creamer. 

Then she asked about my exercise. I’m in the gym 4-5 days a week and I do light cardio and powerlift/crossfit workouts. She wants me to add more cardio. 

Lastly, she told me maybe I need to think about cutting back my Lexapro dosage because it’s an appetite increaser. 

Am I NUTS to think that I may need a new doctor? I’m afraid to go to someone who won’t prescribe it at all, but she is not supportive and really never has been.

1kr5sus,https://www.reddit.com/r/TelogenEffluvium/comments/1kr5sus/how_long_was_your_growth_shedding_overlap_stage/,How long was your growth & shedding overlap stage?,"Guys, I started shedding BAD the beginning of October 2024. It stemmed from 4 things: 

1. Extreme physical, emotional, & mental stress from a bacterial infection I had for 7 months (3 months of slight immune activation & 4 months of intense auto immune response after re exposure) 

2. Sudden removal of my copper IUD (had this from age 20-26… I was a really late bloomer so I’m sure I was still developing physically at 20 tbh) 

3. 1.5 months of oral antibiotics 

4. Diagnosed with hashimotos due to low t3 + elevated tpo antibodies 

Not to mention… PTSD from this STD triggering a lifelong autoimmune condition & huge life changes & friend problems & starting a new job & being on my own the first time financially in my whole life 

I am taking DIM, NAC, Omega 3, Vitamin d + k, multivitamin with folate, zinc, NP Thyroid to support my thyroid levels (it is a very slow process to increase dosage), slynd birth control pills (I hope to only be on this for a few more months as I get my hormones stabilized), mayo-inositol + D-Chiro (I am taking this & birth control bc my thyroid & copper IUD removal have also fucked up my sex hormones) & I am not iron/ferritin deficient. I also am eating the autoimmune protocol diet (besides my morning drink… I have chai & sometimes I’ll have coffee… however, my acne is still lingering so, if this isn’t gone in a week I’m cutting these out of my diet bc it’s the only possible food trigger left at this point) 



Given the above, and what you’ve experienced, how long might I expect these two stages to overlap for? I have about 1-1.5 inches of growth in some areas. But, I’m still shedding like crazy. I know my situation is quite unique and complex but, any insight to help ease my mind would be amazing. If things don’t improve here in the next 3-4 months I’ll probably chop off my hair (it’s past my boobs & beautiful😔) or… possibly get extensions (if I find some that aren’t damaging).

1kr5rw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kr5rw4/homemade_decaf_tea_attempt/,Homemade Decaf Tea Attempt,"I've been having sound and light sensitivity along with irritability due to caffeine consumption (mostly black tea with milk).
I've tried various decaf coffees and teas but they are too expensive and not good tasting.

So I tried making my own decaf team based on the principle that carbon dioxide acts as a solvent to draw out caffeine. The steps I followed are as follows:

Soaked 100 grams of loose leaf black tea (Taj Mahal) in room temperature club soda for 4 hours stirring it gently. Kept a lid loosely closed on the jar. Stirred the mixture every 1 hour adding a little more soda each time so that the tea leaves remained submerged.

After 4 hours, I strained out the flat club soda using a tea strainer. Rinsed the tea leaves with fresh water 2-3 times. 

Then let the tea leaves dry for 2 days. The tea leaves were closer to brown now while they were closer to black earlier.

Tried the ""decaf"" tea today. It tasted a little better than the decaf teas in the market. Didn't feel the caffeine triggered energy boost, but I felt I could have this long term (which I've never felt with other decaf teas).

I have no idea how much caffeine was extracted out and how much remains. The tea leaves smelled gentler. The flat club soda that I had strained out earlier had a strong bitter smell that made me wonder why we put such strong horrible stuff into our system regularly.

This is just my experiment. Thoughts, suggestions, criticism welcome.",1,1747750098.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1kr5reo,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kr5reo/the_day_the_earth_blew_up_might_be_the_best_movie/,The Day The Earth Blew Up might be the best movie about neurodivergency I've ever seen,"I've kind of been sitting on this thing I wrote after seeing the new Looney Tunes film weeks ago—haven't really known where to post it and I actually felt like the things I saw in the film were so apparent that there'd be dozens of Youtube essays on the topic. But I actually can't find a single person taking about the biggest and best parts about the film and it's something that I feel is kind of groundbreaking and a huge deal. 

I mentioned this in the recent post about the HBO Max release of the film and got some encouragement to post it here (one person, that's all it takes for me I guess 😂) so, here's why I think The Day The Earth Blew Up was a (apparently stealth) story about the struggles and joys of being nuerodivergent:



I just saw The Day The Earth Blew Up last night and I fully expected to love it, had no doubts it was going to be as so many people had dubbed it, The Greatest Looney Tunes Media Ever Made—and it was all that. But so much more. There are several angles and aspects of the film that I could go into a lot of detail on their own, there's so much about this movie that is insanely special. But I think I want to start with the most unexpected part of the film: making Daffy Duck ADHD coded and perfectly following the struggles and what is needed to find happiness. 

I'm going to be spoiling a lot of the film, all of these aspects come to a head in the climax of the story. I'm not going to give everything away, but in order to fully talk about this I'll have to go into detail about that important scene near the end. If you're already seeing it soon, hold off on reading this until later. But if you don't care of spoilers, are on the fence on if you want to see it or not, or are just really wanting to know what the heck I'm talking about, then continue on! 


The main characters of the film are Daffy and Porky, abandoned when they were young and rescued by a farmer. They grew up together, basically becoming brothers. The flashback of their childhood ends with them being left their house and they are told to stick together and take care of their home. This scene is pivotal to the whole film to such a crazy degree that it deserves its own breakdown—later, that's for another post. Point is, the importance of the house is established and then we jump back to the present time. 

We start with Porky waking up, and things look great—his bed and whole room is clean, well put together. They grew up and kept their promise. But...the camera pulls out and Porky's bed is only one side of the room. The other has Daffy, sleeping in a dirty looking bathtub, his whole side visibly unclean and falling apart. 

Porky informs Daffy that today is their house inspection day and they have to clean up and get things nice so they pass the inspection and get to keep the house. As he is telling him this, we see more of the state of the house, messes everywhere, stacked up dishes on every surface of the kitchen. 

I wanna take a moment to say that Daffy is never made to be the only cause of why the house looks like it does. Porky also has some irresponsible tendencies/not knowing quite how to keep things working right—but Porky is the only one that acknowledges that things aren't great in the house and he is visibly upset sometimes, clearly wanting a cleaner environment. But even if he had his way, I still don't think it would be a completely spotless perfect home either. Porky is presented as more together as Daffy but he still isn't perfect—just passes more easily as being ""not Looney"". 

Well, surprising no one, they fail the house inspection, and are given 10 days to fix their roof or the house will be taken from them. That sends them on a journey to find jobs to make enough money to pay for the repairs in time. 

A montage begins (presented as a Looney Tunes short within the movie, it's like twenty minutes into the film at this point and it's already incredible) showing all of their attempts at jobs that all end in being fired. What becomes clear is they are both really bad at everything...but Porky is able to hold it together and stay level headed. This is best shown when they try to work in a coffee shop. The first customer comes in and begins to list the scientific breakdown of her chosen customized coffee, and both Porky and Daffy's brains immediately get overwhelmed, but in different ways. 

Porky completely shuts down; Daffy gets mad and loud. 

Could Porky have figured it out on his own and maybe been able to make the coffee? Perhaps, but likely not. But he doesn't get a chance to try. Daffy confronts the woman, asking her what her problem is, is she even speaking English, ""What's wrong with you, this is a coffee shop!"". 

FIRED! is stamped across the screen, just one of many failed attempts at finding a job that they can manage. 

Going to skip over some details now and just vaguely say that they meet another very important character, Petunia, and they have a kinship with her immediately and she offers to find them jobs at the gum factory she works in. 

Cut to the next day, Porky and Daffy are put in front of a button and a lever. All they have to do is: Porky push, Daffy pull. The person leaving them with the job reiterates how easy it is...but ominously says that one mistake and they will be instantly fired. 

Porky is nervous. Not only is this probably the last job they can find with enough time to still be able to make enough money to fix the roof, but it's also a job that a cute girl helped him get.

Porky slowly does his part, presses the button, and Daffy immediately pulls out a mallet and is about to smash the lever. Porky jumps into action, his first time attempting to prevent Daffy from getting them fired. He grabs his hand and calmly tells him that he isn't supposed to smash the lever, but pull it. 

Understanding hits him, and he pulls it. They get into a groove of pushing and pulling that turns into a musical number that carries them through their whole shift. They have finally seen a job through to the end without disaster. 

Daffy is ecstatic as well, saying something to the effect of, ""We finally found our calling...as entry level factory workers!""

I'm gonna skip even more details to avoid spoiling as little as I can. But as the movie continues, Porky more directly begins to recognize that Daffy unintentionally causes a lot of their problems and he begins to try and minimize him. They make a plan to fight back against the aliens and Porky manipulates the situation to convince Daffy that he has to stay behind. Queue a montage of Porky and Petunia kicking ass against the aliens to the song It's The End of the World As We Know It (as one does in an animated film with this subtitle :p).

They acknowledge how great they've done and agree that they make a great team...right as Daffy has emerged from the basement, giant mallet in hand. In just the pre-fight taunting he accidentally destroys the two weapons that Porky and Petunia have that are their only way of fighting back. 

In the midst of running away, there's a moment where Porky needs to trust Daffy...but he can't. He has let him down figuratively so many times, how can he trust him to physically catch him as he jumps between two buildings? Porky's hesitation spells disaster and they are all captured. 

As the villain is revealed to them and making his showy threats, they quickly end up turning on each other, Porky's frustrations with Daffy fully revealed but Daffy also learns how Porky manipulated him to get him out of the way. They are thrown into a cage by the villain and the fighting eventually ends in tears, where they reach the beginnings of an understanding...but then things really hit the fan, and a whole new threat is revealed. 

Now, this, this is the moment where everything I thought I was seeing was confirmed. All these elements throughout of Daffy living the neurodivergent/ADHD way of being different, not knowing how to fit in, causing problems for himself and others no matter how hard he tries not to—it all comes to a head in the climax of the movie. 

They have a plan to blow something up: Petunia is going to man the lift to get them down and back up, Porky is going to set what's going to trigger the explosion...and Daffy is handed a golden gun that he used in their very first job attempt, newspaper delivery, where he used the weapon to launch a barrage of newspapers that just about destroyed the whole neighborhood. 

For a split second he is excited, he finally gets to join the fight, he is going to help save the world...but he looks at the gun again and he flashes back to the incident with the newspapers. For the first time in the entire film Daffy is visibly anxious and unsure. 

He says, ""I don't know about this—this is an important job, what if I mess it up?"" The anxiety goes away as he makes the decision to hand the gun responsibility over to Petunia while he takes her spot at the lift...which is controlled by a lever. The one ""normal"" job he has ever been able to do. He seems fine with it, maybe even outright happy—but Porky again hesitates. You can see that he doesn't fully agree with this, that on some level he sees what Daffy is really doing, what neurodivergent people have to do every day: find the one little slot that they can manage to fit in, relinquish everything that makes them special in order to appear ""not Looney"". 

But time is short, Porky had already hesitated once and things got worse, so he agrees. Him and Petunia ride the lift down and it's like before, perfect team, in sync, they set up everything and Daffy successfully gets them back up on the lift with no problems at all. That is, until what is supposed to set off the explosions fails. 

Everyone is freaking out, both there and in their ears from the characters helping them from afar. But Porky looks up and notices there are some really sharp hanging rocks directly above the massive hole where the explosives are set. 

""I g-got an idea! And it's a p-plan that only one person can do: Daffy Duck!"" 

His plan is to cause so much chaos that it jostles the rocks up above and falls, triggering the explosives. Daffy takes out TWO mallets and is allowed to go ""full Looney""—he leaps down and unleashes the full destructive comedic power of a Looney Tune. 

He was given a task that made full use of what makes him different and special, and he didn't have to hold anything back. And what made this scene even more incredible is that for the first and only time in the whole film...the Looney Tunes theme swells to the forefront 🥹

Over the course of the plot of a Looney Tunes movie they presented maybe one of the best story arcs I've ever seen of the struggles of the neurodiverse, the struggles that people around them can face, and how, if given the right opportunity and direction with something that embraces their strengths and weaknesses they can do amazing things like save the whole dang world. 

And to do all of that with Looney Tunes who embody what an average person picture someone with ADHD to be like (hyper, bouncing off the walls) is such a brilliant use of the franchise to tell a story like this. 

I went into the movie fully expecting to see the greatest piece of Looney Tunes media ever but I never in a million years thought I would leave the theater kind of emotionally reeling with the unbelievable realization that Daffy Duck is a new neurodiverse icon.

When they say “You know when you know” I had a strong feeling I was pregnant. 
Fast forward to the test. Instantly positive.
My heart dropped, My body went numb and i felt horrified. So i took another, also positive. I literally stood in the bathroom in shock, I was so scared. Asking myself what am I going to do. instantly I put my trust in God. when you trust God, theres a sense of peace that everything is going to okay 
I knew I was not ready for pregnancy, I’m 21, finishing nursing school. I knew who the dad was, he’s the only person ive been sexually active with. I told him 3 days after missing my period, we planned on seeing each other that weekend to take a pregnancy test together, but by the middle of the week we both just wanted a peace of mind. So I took it at 8am, he was at work. I didn’t tell him till he got off work. It was a lot to take in, I sat in my head all day (it happens, if you’re going through this. It okay. listen to your thoughts and figure out what YOU want to do before making a decision). I know telling your partner about being unexpectedly pregnant is a lot to take in so I waited for him to get off before I lashed that news. 
We’re both young, going into our dream careers. We always talked about marriage, kids and having a house and joking around about not getting pregnant! But neverrrr did I or WE think a kid would come so soon! That wasn’t the plan. So we got together that weekend, and there was a lot of emotions involved but i think that’s the hardest part of it all, is making the decision. If YOU or you and your partner are making this decision just know it’s always for the best. whatever you agree too. This has been such a lesson for both my significant other & I. Supporting each other through it all has helped sooo so so much. 
**also, i inputed the positive pregnancy tests into Flo and it calculated how far along i was.
I started googling abortion options, after we both came to an agreement that would be the best option. 
I called planned parenthood, I was able to qualify for assistance with no insurance $650 to $70! I set an appointment. Mind you I live in texas so I had to fly to CO, had to find somewhere to stay for the weekend and when I got back to texas. It was a Friday-Sunday experience 

i was so scared, guilty, and sad. The days felt so long like I just wanted to get it over with. I was going through a rabbit hole on reddit about people experiences. Everything was super negative. I was crying so much, didn’t have the energy to do anything, I was second guessing. I cried so much the first week of me finding out I was pregnant, the second week I felt confident in my decision. Anyway, As I say the HARDEST part is actually doing it. 
Fast forward. 
We go to my appointment. It was so quick. I had so much adrenaline, the appointment was 1hr 30 mins. 
I had an ultrasound done. They told me the fetus was .35cm. Super super small
The doctor prescribed me misopristone which I took at the clinic. The Misopristone just stops the fetus from growing, I had no side effects. We went out to eat later that day and hung out in the city. 
 I was sent home with 4 pills of misoprostol to take vaginally 24-48 hours after taking mifepristone, and she sent me home with prescripted 800mg of ibuprofen, and zofran to take 30 mins before taking mifepristone. The doctor was like you’ll be fine and that was it. 
I was so scared to take the mifepristone. I wait 24 hours to get back to texas. I had fear for what was to come. I cried just a little before inserting them & just prayed I wouldn’t be in pain. I'd been reading about medical abortion horror stories all week leading up to this.

I took the pain medication 30mins before. I had my coffee, 3 boiled eggs and a chicken taco, after I went to the restroom and inserted all 4 pills.
soon as I walked out the restroom within 3 minutes. I felt my vagina burning, and I told my partner the sensation felt so weird. I looked it up it said it was normal to feel after 20 mins but I felt it instantly. 
1hour later, I had no cramps. I was laughing and chatting I went to the restroom just to check to see if anything was working or happening and it was stream of blood soon as I pulled down my pants.. I didn’t expect it to be so quick, I felt 4-5 blood clogs. No pain! No cramps. Nothing. It felt a little weird feeling clots come out but nothing painful whatsoever. I cleaned myself up, and went back to sit and chitchat I was shocked at how quick that was. Then two hours later again no cramps. My partner told me to go change I had blood all over, I was again in shocked because I felt no cramps. I had a few more blood clots come out as I was peeing but I didn’t see anything. 
I changed my pads two times within the 3-4 hours. 
After that it was over my period lighten up SIGNIFICANTLY. I was shocked actually! 
I took the pain medication again after 8 hours and was chilling. 
The next day about 24 hours later I felt comfortable putting on a tampon since my period lightened up so much, I went to the gym for 45 mins cardio. I’m still being mindful to letting my uterus heal so no heavy lifting for a week. But with the 45 min cardio I felt totally fine. Today I went to the gym again and did upper body i’m totally fine. 
Taking it day by day healing. I’m still bleeding but I’m so glad I didn’t experience what I thought I would. 

I truly hope this comes across the right person who is nervous, has anxiety about what to do and how “painful” the experience is. It’s not, the toughest part I truly think is. Is deciding what you’re going to do ❤️‍🩹 Everything will be fine ",1,1747750000.0,abortion,1,1.0,False

And I only bring it up because she’s the last person I expected to make money online.

She used to work the front desk at a local clinic, but that job got cut during COVID. Since then, she’s been trying to find something remote—admin work, customer service, anything. But she kept running into scams or stuff that required tons of experience or certifications. She even said to me once, “I’m not techy, and I don’t know what all this online work stuff even means.”

Then in January, she texted me asking if I’d heard of a site called Paid Online Writing Jobs. Supposedly, it connected people with flexible writing gigs—stuff like product descriptions, basic email templates, and reviews. I told her to be careful. You know how it is—so many sites look legit but end up being sketchy.

[Paid Online Writing Jobs](https://preview.redd.it/b8he0f4t1y1f1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea93daeb2fc999c4254052914a3e0a0fda76ea7c)

But Lisa’s pretty cautious. She watched some reviews, read through the FAQ, and ended up signing up with a basic writing sample—just to test the waters.

Two weeks later, she sends me a screenshot of her PayPal with a $78 deposit. She had written five product blurbs for an e-commerce site—super simple stuff like ""describe these noise-canceling headphones in 100 words.""

Fast forward to now: she’s not getting rich, but she’s consistently pulling in a few hundred bucks each month. She works from her kitchen table with her laptop, sometimes while sipping coffee in the morning, or late at night when the house is quiet. No Zoom calls. No cold pitching. Just her and a doc file.

She even started getting into writing better headlines and says it’s kinda fun now. 🤷‍♂️

Look, I wouldn’t say it’s for everyone. But if you’ve got a decent grasp of English and are okay writing simple stuff (not novels—think short product blurbs or review-style content), it might be worth looking into.

1kr5lg0,https://i.redd.it/eab2ck201y1f1.jpeg,The Pros and Cons of Selling Your Home in Arkansas as a For Sale by Owner,"Marketing your residence can be an intimidating journey, particularly if it’s your first time. There are numerous options to make, from determining the price of your property to effectively publicizing it. One of the most significant decisions you’ll confront is whether to market your residence through a real estate broker or independently as a for sale by proprietor (FSBO). In this piece, we’ll take a closer look at the advantages and downsides of selling your residence in Arkansas as a FSBO.\
\
Advantages of Marketing Your Residence as a FSBO in Arkansas:\
\
1. Financial Savings: Conceivably the most attractive perk of marketing your residence as a FSBO is the potential to save funds on real estate broker commission charges. Conventional real estate brokers commonly impose a commission of 5-6% of the ultimate sale price, which can accumulate to thousands of dollars. By marketing your residence on your own, you can evade these fees and retain more of the sale proceeds for yourself.\
\
2. Authority: When you market your residence as a FSBO, you have absolute authority over the entire sales process. You can make decisions about the listing value, the timing of viewings, and the negotiation of offers. This level of authority can be empowering for numerous proprietors who want to be actively engaged in the sale of their property.\
\
3. Personalized Approach: As the proprietor of the property, you possess the finest understanding of its distinctive features and selling points. When you market as a FSBO, you have the prospect to personally showcase these features to potential purchasers and underscore the aspects of your home that make it special. This personalized approach can aid in establishing a robust connection between purchasers and your property.\
\
4. Adaptability: Marketing your residence without a real estate broker gives you the adaptability to establish your own timetable for viewings and open houses. You won’t have to work around a broker’s availability, and you can arrange viewings at a time that’s convenient for you and potential purchasers.\
\
Downsides of Marketing Your Residence as a FSBO in Arkansas:\
\
1. Restricted Exposure: One of the most notable challenges of marketing your residence as a FSBO is the narrow exposure your property may garner. Real estate brokers have admission to multiple listing services (MLS) which is a database of properties for sale, and they possess a network of other brokers and potential purchasers. Without the reach of a broker, it can be more challenging to draw as many potential purchasers.\
\
2. Advertising Obstacles: As a FSBO, you will be accountable for publicizing your property effectively to reach potential purchasers. This can be a significant challenge, as it necessitates a robust understanding of the local housing market, effective advertising strategies, and the capacity to craft high-quality marketing materials such as photographs and videos.\
\
3. Bargaining Proficiency: Bargaining with potential purchasers can be a complex and stressful process, particularly if you lack experience in real estate. Real estate brokers are trained to negotiate on behalf of their clients and can frequently secure a higher selling price than a FSBO could on their own.\
\
4. Legal Dangers: Marketing a residence encompasses a notable volume of legal paperwork and processes. Without the guidance of a real estate broker, there is a risk of making errors that could result in legal issues down the line. It’s imperative to be well-informed about the legal requirements of marketing a residence in Arkansas and to seek professional advice when necessary.\
\
Pointers for Effectively Marketing Your Residence as a FSBO in Arkansas:\
\
While marketing your residence as a FSBO presents its own array of challenges, it is plausible to do so effectively with the appropriate approach. Here are some pointers for marketing your residence on your own in Arkansas:\
\
1. Set a Competitive Pricing for Your Residence: Investigate the local housing market to ascertain a competitive listing price for your residence. It’s crucial to be pragmatic about the value of your property and to refrain from overpricing it, as this can deter potential purchasers.\
\
2. Engage Professional Photographers: High-quality photographs are indispensable for enticing purchasers to your property. Deliberate on employing professional photographers to capture images of your residence, as this can significantly enhance the visual allure of your listings.\
\
3. Harness Online Listing Services: While you may not have access to the MLS as a FSBO, there are numerous online listing services and websites where you can advertise your property. Avail of these platforms to amplify the exposure of your residence to potential purchasers.\
\
4. Seek Legal Counsel: Marketing a residence encompasses a myriad of legal processes, encompassing the preparation of contracts and disclosure documents. It’s crucial to seek legal counsel to ensure that you are meeting all the legal requirements of marketing a residence in Arkansas.\
\
5. Mull over Engaging a Real Estate Attorney: While you may not necessitate a real estate broker, you may benefit from engaging a real estate attorney to steer you through the sales process and to review any legal documents.\
\
6. Be Willing to Bargain: Bargaining with potential purchasers is a fundamental facet of marketing a residence. Be open to negotiating on the sale price and be prepared to manage counteroffers in a professional and decisive manner.\
\
7. Prepare Your Residence for Viewings: Ensure that your residence is orderly, well-maintained, and staged competently for viewings. Initial impressions are pivotal in the home selling process, so it’s imperative to ensure that your property is presented in the best feasible light.\
\
In Summary:\
\
Marketing your residence as a FSBO in Arkansas can be a gratifying experience, but it also comes with its own array of challenges. It’s crucial to thoroughly ponder the pros and cons of marketing on your own before making a decision. If you opt to market your residence as a FSBO, be primed to invest time and effort into publicizing and showcasing your property in a manner that maximizes its appeal to potential purchasers. With the appropriate approach and the support of professionals such as real estate attorneys and photographers, it is plausible to successfully market your residence on your own and save on commission fees in the process.\

1kr5iid,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1kr5iid/got_diagnosed_in_germany/,Got diagnosed in Germany,"Almost 9 months since my health suddenly deteriorated severely after a viral upper respiratory infection that I contracted at the end of August of 2024, I was finally officially diagnosed with POTS by a neurologist in Germany, following a battery examinations for which there was a two-month waiting period. I was diagnosed based on my description of my symptoms, the circumstances of their onset, and above all the results of my tilt-table test, which showed a pronounced change in my heart rate as the table turned (and apparently my blood pressure too, which also rose, though not as drastically). Various other examinations were also performed to exclude other conditions, some of them earlier and at different clinics, e.g. a brain and spine MRI, an HIV test etc.

The tilt-table test was performed without any nitroglycerin (which is administered by some doctors, as I have had occasion to read on this subreddit) or other drug, after I had been adhering to a diet excluding energizers like cheese and nuts for three days. I had also been supposed to refrain from coffee, but I cheated because I could not help myself. The results clearly showed POTS even so.

There were three tasks to be performed during the tilt-table test, after an initial rest period of 30 minutes: 

\- breathing at the rhythm at which an arrow slid up and down on a screen, while wearing a belt measuring chest expansion and contraction

\- forcefully exhaling for multiple seconds into a narrow tube which prevents expulsion of large amounts of air at once (Valsalva maneuver)

\- being suddenly raised into a 70 degree position by the press of a button (I had expected that it would be more gradual) and being kept upright for 15 minutes

Blood samples were taken before the initial rest, after it, and while I was upright, to check variations in my catecholamines. The laboratory results are still not ready.

The first exercise did not strain me any more than usual breathing (mild dyspnea is one of my symptoms). The second exercise was extremely unpleasant, causing me to experience dizziness and making my heart and aorta feel like they were exploding inside my chest. It was explained to me that the task was comparable to blowing a balloon, something which I had not attempted since the onset of my symptoms. However, I had experienced similar symptoms during other Valsalva maneuvers, e.g. when popping my ears or when having a bowel movement. I guess that that's because Valsalva maneuvers in general are a problem for people with POTS and that that's why there was a separate Valsalva task within the TTT to begin with. Lastly, the sudden rise into a 70 degree position was a bit more uncomfortable than simply standing up from bed as I naturally would. I felt my heart rate accelerate and a rush of blood in my head, accompanied by a strong headache which lasted for about 15 seconds, and which I regularly experience when getting up after a longer rest. At any rate, I definitely did not experience extreme distress, like some other members of this subreddit who described their experience as torture, which involved fainting, vomiting or the like, and I was able to take my daily walk without any problems that evening. I guess that I have mild POTS, though the doctor did not make any mention of degree.

I find it strange that I had to undergo the TTT on an empty stomach and was not tested in any way after a meal, even though meals, especially larger, carbohydrate-heavy meals exacerbate my symptoms appreciably. On an empty stomach, my heart rate rose by about 40-50 beats when the table was lifted, from about 55 to about a 100 (I did not have the chance to read the graphs produced by the machine, whereas the neurologist only summarized them imprecisely), whereas after a meal, I sometimes measure as much as 130 when standing still.

The neurologist also determined that I am hypermobile (I guess that means I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, though she did not name that syndrome explicitly) and noticed that I have ADHD. She told me that these show some correlation with POTS; I guess that they increased my risk of developing the condition. The neurologist did not speculate on the etiology of my POTS, remarking that in the absence of any relevant medical data about my blood pressure, heart rate and the like, it would be unwise to do so. I suppose that without such data, we cannot know whether my viral infection caused me to develop POTS for the first time or made my pre-existing mild POTS, which I had been fully unaware of, worse.

Interestingly, the neurological examination incidentally revealed that I am quite asymmetrical - one of my pupils dilates more in response to light, one of my legs has stronger reflexes, when I walk with my closed eyes I turn toward the left instead of walking straight, different sensory thresholds were measured in my left and right extremities, etc. The neurologist told me that this is innate but did not clarify whether it is relevant to POTS.

Lastly, the neurologist suspects that I have small fiber neuropathy because I was in the 0,01 percentile for pain tolerance (meaning that 99,99 of people would be less tolerant to pain). A skin biopsy was taken to check for this, but the results won't be ready in another two months. However, I think that my pain tolerance is attributable to my personality or life experience and not my nerves. I distinctly felt all the painful stimuli the machine generated - I just did not ask the tester to stop as soon as most other people would have. I think that that's because I'm used to suffering and life has taught me to consider suffering normal, including physical suffering.

Regarding treatment, the neurologist advised vitamins (my vitamin D is still low, after months of taking 2000 IU tablets daily), increased fluid intake, increased salt intake (for fluid retention), compression stockings and a compression belt, 10 mg of amitriptyline before bed for my chronic headache (which has the hallmarks of a migraine), ceasing use of regular analgesics (which might be giving me a medication-overuse headache), avoiding alcohol and tobacco (I am already a tee-totaller since I got ill), smaller meals with more proteins, a regular sleep schedule, and working out to strengthen my leg muscles, while ensuring that my pulse does not rise above 150 during any workout. Most of these things I already knew from the internet, so the neurologist was not very helpful regarding treatment except insofar as she wrote prescriptions for the compression garments and the amitriptyline. However, I do not intend to use the compression garments. I do not feel so disabled as to need them. She said that in my current condition, if I were required to stand still for just 10 minutes, that would be a significant stress for my organism, but I think that she's exaggerating my symptoms (although usually it's the opposite, with doctors downplaying our symptoms). She also said that coffee would worsen my POTS symptoms, but it actually lowers my heartrate, as many people with ADHD have reported. Maybe she did not know about this specificity of people with ADHD.

On the whole, receiving a diagnosis from a knowledgeable and empathetic doctor who took me seriously from the start, organized a very thorough examination process for me, and gave me pertinent advise, in an hour-and-a-half consultation after all the tests had been completed, was a psychologically reparative experience for me. After being gaslit, mocked, humiliated, patronized, infantilized and treated as a nutcase by so many run-of-the mill doctors and psychologists, whose arrogance was proportional to their ignorance, as well as by people from my everyday life such as colleagues and relatives, receiving the diagnosis was very validating. It has calmed the rage I have developed towards everyone who tried to trivialize my suffering and attribute it to psychosomatic factors. I now no longer have as many intrusive thoughts about half-witted GPs accusing me of anxiety leading to outbursts of violence against my furniture. I also feel more self-confident in asserting my needs and limitations in everyday life. As I wrote above, I don't feel *very* disabled, but I do need to abstain from alcohol and I do need to avoid climbing more than a flight of stairs. Now I can say ""sorry, I have POTS, look it up"" self-assuredly, instead of awkwardly mumbling about how ""well the thing is that I can't because I'm unwell, and I don't really know what's wrong with me, but I think it's POTS, except that the doctors said it's anxiety, but that's probably because they only know 3 diagnoses in total"".

I just wanted to share all of this with the subreddit, especially for those who had been reading my earlier posts in this subreddit and others and were curious as to what diagnosis I would end up getting.",1,1747749428.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

I’ve become accustomed to asking for a please before I help her with whatever was being requested. This morning my gf and I had a lazy morning cuddling for an hour before we got up. She asked me as we were moving to get up, “Can you get me a strong coffee?”. I really didn’t want to get her a cup of coffee. I had a busy day with work and already spent a very enjoyable hour bonding with her. Without much of a thought, I said, “what do you say, baby?” with a mischievous smile. I honestly thought at that moment in my drowsiness, that getting a please would make me want to get up and get her coffee (something I do most days). The reaction I got from her was that I was incredibly condescending. She was very upset that I would ask her to say please. I told her that I didn’t think it was that big of a deal to ask for her to ask me nicely. This turned into shouting that I was invalidating her feelings. I said that I thought she was invalidating my feelings as well. Later, I apologized for the way I asked, but I still maintain that it’s not unreasonable to ask for a please, especially when we are trying to teach our child manners. I asked what would be a better way to ask because I’m not sure there is a way to ask for a please without sounding condescending. So I ask you, Reddit, 1. Am I entirely the asshole? And 2. Is there a better way to express to my partner that I feel respected when she politely asks for things (in that moment)? ",3,1747749315.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

Started with Vyvanse 30mg which felt like a miracle. I cried the first day I took it because I couldn’t believe the relief. It didn’t actually do much for my focus or memory, but it calmed down the sensory overwhelm and made everything feel easier.

Unfortunately my insurance changed that first month and I wasn’t able to get it approved again.

Tried Adderall next (generic IR 10 mg twice daily). Absolutely hated it. On one hand, it worked even better than the Vyvanse at actually quieting my brain and taking away every ounce of anxiety. For the first time in my life, I could actually practice meditation. But it made me really tired. Like, I almost fell asleep while driving to work tired and realized I couldn’t take it until I got there. I wanted to nap every time it kicked in. If I took a quick nap after taking it, I would wake up with great focus ability. But it only lasted for 3 hours, then I had an awful crash when it wore off, which I had not had on the Vyvanse. And obviously, napping at work after taking the second dose wasn’t doable. My mood also tanked, to the point where I felt like it was making me depressed. After ten days, I stopped taking it and decided I’d rather be off meds than on that one. 

My doctor switched me to Concerta while trying to get Vyvanse approved. I loved Concerta. It made me more productive than I’d ever been in my life. My brain felt fantastic. So clear and focused. Memory and focus greatly improved. I even stopped being clumsy lol. But I had physical side effects (sweating, body odor, bloating, severe stomach cramps, and it stopped my period). I also had really bad crashes at night (as bad as Adderall). No depression though. I was hoping the side effects would go away, but ten days in I got word that my new insurance had approved Vyvanse so I switched.

Only… it was different. Generic instead of the name brand I tried at first. No side effects, but it doesn’t feel very effective. Helpful but not strong enough to make a huge difference. Milder crash, but I do get irritable when it wears off. I’ve found that I can mitigate this somewhat by drinking a strong cup of coffee at the 7 hour mark. 

I have a med appointment coming up and I’m trying to decide if I want to stick with the Vyvanse, ask for a dose increase, go back to Concerta and see if the side effects go away, or ask to try something else. Advice welcome. ",1,1747748576.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I met new faces all tbe time. But, he is different. He introduced himself the way no one ever did. He pffered his hand and shook with mine to inteoduce himself. Im in total awe. My heart stopped that time. Throughout the rest of the shift, my minds wandering and my face flustered. I really felt something i never did before. But i ignored it because it could be nothing.

I try to know as much as I could about him. He loves sweets and I am a baker. So I bring him baked goods every week. He accepts it and seems happy about it. He's so nice, organised, respectful, understanding, intelligent, carries himself professionally, presentable, and charming. 

One time I ask him for coffee catch up but he was busy and he lives really far away. So, i dismissed that though as i got busy with my work and college. I try everything I can to be able to work with him. I even did a double shift because his shift was short staffed. I even missed my stop just so I can talk to him more in the train. I ask him some medical stuffs because it his like of profession. But he rarely replies right away not unless its work related. My co workers know that I really like him and tries to tease us. But I just notice he acts differently when im around. He's aloof and quiet when im around but becomes chatty when im gone. He wont talk to me not unless I initiated it. 

Its been more than a month since I met him. My feelings for him did damage more than good to me. Its frustrating the way he acts. But I dont expect anything. I know i have no chance. He's a professional in his field. I never imagine anything beyond liking him. I never dreamt of my feelings being reciprocated. But Im certain he knows and i just wished he would tell me to stop.

Im 36 years old 6'1"" and 242lbs.
Im not in terrible shape, but I was hard stuck at 168-177lbs for most of my life.

Mostly since 2020 I haven't done much, but I used to be extremely active.
My goal is to get below 220LBS, and to run a 5k 3 miles in under 25 minutes later in July.

Thats the goal, the end goal, be able to run a 5k at roughly 8 minute pace. And I gave myself 3 months to get in shape enough to do it.

However, I started 4 weeks ago, doing 100 push-ups a day and around 90 squats/lunges. 10-10-10 squat lunge lunge.
Im starting an actual program with cardio today off of an app, so I took update pictures and weighed myself again 4 weeks later.
I haven't lost any weight, im still 242, and I see no difference in the pictures.

I've cut my diet for the past 4 weeks as well. Zero mc'chickens for lunch at work, zero pop, zero night time doritos and such.
Every day for lunch I've had one bag of great value cubed pepper jack cheese, and a banana; and have drank nothing but water and coffee. 

So my question is, can I reach my goal by mid/late July? Given that I haven't seen any returns so far.",1,1747748408.0,fitness30plus,9,1.0,False

We met at this old coffee place i used to work at and kept in touch when we both left and moved cities. We used to rarely text just checking up every couple of weeks and when he broke up with his ex he started talking to me daily. 

He has a history of depression (so do I btw so I get where hes coming from) so I understand the need for companionship especially when things get hard. However lately its been getting too much. 

A bit of context: when we were coworkers i had a S/O and he was single. After I quit first and left my ex he admitted he used to have a crush on me but had moved on. Obviously this being 3 years ago now I didnt think anything of it and quite frankly forgot about it. I dont like him that way, I see him more of an older brother type especially when we used to work together and that dynamic so its just strange for me to see him in a different way.

Recently, ive noticed him being more 'needy' than usual. He sometimes try calling me petnames and ive expressed that they make me uncomfortable but i feel like he maybe likes me again? (feel free to ignore this - just a random thought not really pertinent to the story) 

I feel as if his mood entirely depends on when/how frequently I text him and he gets quite upset if im 'busy' or im tired after coming home from work and not wanting to speak really. (i make it really clear so i dont leave him on delivered for hours without notice). Furthermore, I feel as if since his breakup his depression as gotten worse (not saying anything wrong with that) but im finding myself feeling like completely responsible for him if something happens. I've found myself staying up till 4am trying to make sure hes okay even when I have work in the morning and its left me quite frankly extremely exhausted. (No I dont know what his address is nor do I have any of his friends contacts that live in the same city as him)

As I said before I also have a history of depression and anxiety and this entire situation is quite frankly getting to me. Im constantly stressed, whether thats at work or not at work. I've been struggling with a couple things at work recently and thats made my mood a lot worse and constantly dealing with him has made it so I can never talk about my struggles. When ive tried recently to talk about how im feeling hes found a way to make it about himself. I get that I sound like a terrible friend right now but my own mental health has taken a dive and im not sure how long i can deal with this.

Genuinely not sure what to do. Im debating cutting him off because Im trying to get my life in order, not get worse which is something ive struggled with my entire life. I really care about him but im not 16 with no responsibilities. I've got people who depend on me and I cant be on speed dial for someone who 1) doesnt live in the same city as me. 2) has supposedly 'closer' friends he could confide in and lastly doesnt accept that I lead a very packed lifestyle and im really fucking busy all the time.

On Valentines, Liam and Sarah booked a  romantic getaway to a cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains.  It was an old abandoned distillery that had been converted to a trendy air bnb. 

“It has a hot tub,” Liam said with excitement waving a chicken wing in the air, “it says the tubs under the stars and has a cedar sauna beside it.” 

The road up to it was on a deep incline and their coupe could barely climb it.  For Sarah the forest was so green that it sorta felt that Liam was throttling them through the middle of a dark green velvety emerald tunnel. 

Upon arrival at the old distillery, the forest seemed unusually quiet, and as the moon came up, the shadows seemed to stretching like nets among the trees.  Liam hesitated to go to the hot tub, being from the city this all was too new to him. 

Oblivious to fear,  Sarah tried to make him more comfortable.  Three firestarters and fifty matches later, Sarah had a raging fire going for them.  They listened to some Appalachian lullabies that Sarah had found about murder ballads.   They toasted marshmallows.  The sweet smell of chocolate and mallow sat in their nose.  The quiet of the mountains settled into their bodies so they found themselves settling into their quilts sooner than they expected.  

Later that night they clung tight to each other’s hand as they heard a murmur that gurgled then whooshed, but they quickly realized it was just the hot tub draining.  

Tossing and turning, Sarah found she couldn’t sleep so she crept out of bed with the first cracks of daen.  She got some coffee and decided to find the cellar.  She’d read online that it was a very long maze because the bootleggers built it that way to hide from the long arm of the law.  

With her flashlight guiding her, Sarah crept through small, decrepit passages in the basement cellar.  Urban legends online claimed the previous owners buried all their coins along the cellar trails and that if you were lucky one of those coins would shine for you.  The flashlight filtered the ground  as Sarah looked for little glints of light.  Some of the money was even supposed to be from before the Civil War… long before Dan Guthrie turned up dead in 1992 leaving the distillery abandoned.  

The flashlight failed to pick up any silvery coins but instead an eerie green glow could be seen in the dirt floor.  Sarah thought it smelled like the alfalfa sprouts that Liam liked to put on their sandwiches.  She moved closer, dropping to her knees.  The passage had shrunken anyway to the point she needed to lean over anyway.

Sarah followed the glow green train as fast as her hands could scamper,  the ghoulish glow help dimly light the passage. Suddenly Sarah saw a flash of light and realized it was a grime covered mirror tilted on its side that someone left behind.  Sarah struck her light on it gazing into it, and what she saw shocked her.

It was Liam sleeping.

His eyes shut unaware dark green moss was now growing over them.  He was covered head to two in dark green, velvety moss. Sarah turned her flashlight to try to get a better view but the image was gone. She decided it had to be an impression, light retraction or something. 

She stumbled forward, needy to continue following the green plasma along the trail.  Suddenly, Liam’s voice was behind her.  Her name echoing down the passage. ""Sarah!  Where are you? Sarah. Sarah!!”

Sarah turned to answer, but her voice was paralysed.  The best she could get out was a whisper of, “I’m here, Liam.”  But it went nowhere,  instead bouncing around like whispery cacophony. 

Sarah tried to crawl backwards but notice that the eerie green substance now covered her.  She stopped at the mirror to see if it was covering her face like the rest of her, but what she saw horrified her.  It wasn’t her face, it was Liams.  

“Sarah, where are you,” Liam asked from inside the mirror.  

Sarah felt uncontrollably pulled toward it. She placed her finger on Liam’s lips. “Please quiet, Liam,” she said in gasps realizing she could barely breathe. 

She tottered backwards realizing the ghastly green color now saturated her whole face.  She opened her mouth anc rotten smell waifed out of it.  Her tongue was covered in the verdant.  The mountains haunted spirits were inside her. She fled on hands and knees as fast as her hands could go but an unbearable need to sleep came over her and she succumbed to it.  

The autopsy showed that despite her desperate surge of determination, Sarah had run out of air in the far reaches of the tunnel.  It was a freak accident. That Sarah had used a bolt cutter to venture to the off-limits cellar was brought up as a way to help Liam understand Sarah had made a grave mistake.  All the paperwork they had signed, agreed they wouldn’t , straight into Michael’s arms. 

Liam stared in disbelief, then fled from the boutique distillery hotel.  Maybe it was that bottle of liquor they’d found in in the shed by the sauna, Liam thought guilty. But no that couldn’t be, it tasted fine.  There was was nothing to believe there.  If that was the case, then why was he fine.  He sped down the mountains same passage as up, but this time declining, barreling him out of there. 

Liam went the six hundred miles to their home in the speed of light.  He insisted to himself it was just a nightmare.  But he knew it was real, he’d take care of all the papers when the authorities called.  He was dizzy and shaking by the time he walked through the door.  

“Liam, where have you been,” Sarah said with grief as she jumped up from the couch to greet him.  Her shaking hands grabbed him and kissed him three times. “Im so glad to see you.  I was worried about you!”

But her kiss was icy.  Liam’s hand grabbed her arm but it was unnaturally cold.  He pulled her close to see if she was wearing the gold chain he gave her for their anniversary. It wasn’t there. 

With a cold shiver, Liam turned to look at her face, it was paler, more hollow.  It was mild, but Sarah’s usual tawny color was now replaced with faint ghastly hue.  She smiled, her half crooked smile. The smile Liam had never been sure he liked now looked wonderful,   His half closed eyes looking straight at her in awe, he leaned over to kiss her.  

“Better half-dead than dead,” he said leaning in to kiss her.

She smiled her crooked, little smile. She leaned and smooched him.   Ghostly green stamps tamped into the cracks and crevices of his lip.

“You look like you could use some coffee, honey.  You’ve seen better days,” she said giggling as she floated off to the kitchen.

I asked for the moms number and suggested the date, but before i could invite them she invited us over and specified me and my husband stay for the playdate while our daughter was there. We thought it would be a nice way to get to know the parents and so we agreed. I've always been taught not to show up anywhere empty handed, so we brought a cute cake from a local bakery. Some background info, both families are indian and the culture is to always have something laid out for guests, even if its a bowl of nuts or indian snacks, with chai (indian tea). Even if someone drops by unexpectedly, the expectation is always at least a cup of chai.

Upon arriving, the mother took the cake and placed it in the kitchen. She took out snacks for the kids (crackers, pre-cut cheese and fruits) and gently added ""these snacks are for adults too"", we smiled but didn't touch any of it. About 45 min goes by and they ask us if we want some coffee or tea or soda, not to be too demanding we say we'll have what you're having. They proceed to say they haven't prepped anything, so would have to make it specially, we say water is fine and they hand us a glass of water.

The playdate continues for a bit and then we leave before dinner time. I am completely baffled at the lack of planning, consideration and hosting that happened, not to mention the $45 that i spend on that cake.
Obviously, I have to reciprocate by having a playdate at my place next, and the normal me would prep some snacks for kids AND the parents, but seeing that they didnt really care to do much for us, I am thinking to just pull the same stunt and just make snacks for the kids. so a couple of questions here

AITA for wanting to pull the same stunt when they come over? AND
Is this how playdates work? Are you not supposed to prep something super simple for the parents? thought the point was for parents to also get to know each other a bit while the kids play.
Also, for future play dates..do you not bring anything for the parents when you go their house for the first time for a kid's playdate?

1kr4uw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitesaveamerica/comments/1kr4uw2/target_worker_exposes_massive_tariff_price_hike/,Target worker exposes MASSIVE tariff price hike for popular items: 'Kinda scared',"First inflation report since tariffs announced stuns Wall Street
For months, big retailers have been warning that prices will rise.

Now, thanks to insider information from Target workers, the extent of the raises are becoming apparent. Staff say it is just the beginning. 

A $9.99 USB-C cord from the store's in-house Heyday brand is now ringing up at $17.99, according to a self-identified employee on Reddit. 

'It's happening,' the worker wrote, sharing a photo of the price tag update. 'All of Heyday is going up.'

The spike — an 80 percent increase — is being blamed on the latest wave of tariffs linked to President Donald Trump's trade policies. 

Target's price rises come after Walmart on Thursday confirmed that it is raising prices this month as a direct result of tariffs.

The Trump administration framed tariffs as a way to boost a sleepy domestic manufacturing industry by making foreign goods more expensive. 

It is a shift from the traditional use of tariffs to protect already-growing industries. The goal in 2025 is to kickstart sectors that have seen little recent investment. 

But for goods that rely on global supply chains — like electronics sold at Target — the effects are already showing up on store shelves. 

A Target employee posted a Reddit while swapping out a price point for another that is 80 percent more expensive

The cord is another example of consumers taking to social media to criticize price increases. 

Shoppers have already seen costs balloon at popular stores, including Shein, Temu, and Amazon. 

So far, the increases haven't made a major dent in national inflation data — April's rate moderately ticked up. 

But some executives have warned that consumers will start to feel the impact more broadly in the months ahead. 

Best Buy and Walmart's CEOs have both warned about higher prices. GM and Ford executives both said the tariffs will cut billions out of their company's profits.  

Target has also been transparent about the consumer pricing implications of Trump's trade wars for months.

The company's CEO, Brian Cornell, started warning customers during a March earnings call, when the US was staring down potential 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products. 

At the time, he warned that everyday grocery items that frequently cross borders before making their way to Target's aisles — like strawberries, avocados, bananas, and coffee beans — were set to increase. 

Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, warned shoppers about price changes back in March. Shoppers have already been battling inflationary pressures - the country saw the inflation rate jump over nine percent in 2022.

Targets shoppers are the latest to speak out on social media - Temu and Shein consumers also said they faced big cost jumps.

'If there's a 25 percent tariff, those prices will go up,' he said. 

President Trump has since walked back those tariffs and replaced them with smaller 10 percent import taxes. 

But other major importing countries continue to face 10 percent tariffs from the US.

In April, the country started collecting the tax on all imported goods. 

Now, companies are trying to find a way to protect their profits while also maintaining their store inventories. 

Those pressures are making American consumers clutch their wallets as they anticipate even higher costs.

I’m curious if anyone else can relate to this…

When I was regularly consuming caffeine,especially strong coffeeI noticed this strange emotional pattern,

I’d go through phases of extreme empathy and peoplepleasing. Almost like I couldn’t stop tuning into others' needs, overgiving, overcommitting… 

Then later, I’d crash emotionally. I’d swing into irritation, anger, or even resentment. Burnt out,, and done with everyone.

Since hitting the one month caffeinefree mark, this pattern has drastically reduced. ",5,1747747608.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Review,"Tide 80735045 and the Tide PODS 4-n-1 Ultra Oxi have become staples in my household since giving them a try. As someone who handles daily laundry for a family of four (and sometimes the neighbor's muddy dog's towels, too!), I was genuinely curious about how these detergent pacs claim to be a “next-level stain fighter.” Spoiler alert: I was not disappointed, but there are certainly a few aspects to think over before adding them to your own laundry routine. Let me break it all down, from the highlights to the areas where these pods could do better.  

**Convenient Multi-Chamber Design**  
These detergent pacs come with 4-in-1 technology, and that multi-chamber design immediately caught my attention. Whenever I use them, the capsules dissolve seamlessly whether I toss them in hot or cold water—and I’ve tested both extensively. Each pod contains detergent, a stain remover, a color protector, and pre-treaters. My dark jeans kept their rich color after multiple washes, which was a huge win. Plus, the built-in pre-treater felt like magic. Grass stains, coffee spills, and even mystery stains (you know, the ones your kids can never seem to explain) faded significantly after just one wash.  

[Check Tide 80735045 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bjmx9hq5/)  

**Perfect for Busy People Like Me**  
Time-saving is a big priority in my household, and these pods deliver. No need to measure liquids, add pre-treatments, or worry about spilling detergent everywhere—which I’ve done one too many times. Just toss a single pod in the machine, and you’re good to go. There were stains that I’d usually soak overnight, but with the built-in pre-treater, I could skip that entire step. This is the kind of product I’d recommend to busy parents, workaholics, or anyone who appreciates efficiency in their routine.  

**Winning Points**  
- Effortlessly handles set-in odors and tough stains, including grease and grass.  
- Saves time with an all-in-one design, ideal for families or individuals juggling a busy schedule.  
- Dissolves easily in both hot and cold water—great for delicate clothing or energy-conscious users.  

**Smell That Stays Without Overpowering**  
One feature I underestimated was the subtle but persistent scent. These pods aren’t your typical overpowering floral or fruity storm; instead, they leave clothes fresh and lightly scented. Even a week later, my gym clothes still smelled clean, which blew my mind. Be warned, though: if you're sensitive to scents, it’s something you might need to test out cautiously.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The pods stick together in high humidity environments, potentially leading to wasted product.  
- You have no control over how much detergent goes into the wash—perfect for average loads but not ideal for customized cleaning needs.  
- Might not be as cost-effective for large households with constant heavy-duty loads.  

**How Does It Fare Against Direct Competitors?**  
Compared to other detergent pacs I’ve tried, like Gain Flings and Arm & Hammer pods, Tide’s offering definitely pulls ahead on stain removal. While Gain excels in creating that unforgettable aroma many of us love, it lacks the robust cleaning and pre-treating power Tide delivers. Arm & Hammer does better with budget-friendly bulk options, but it fell short on eliminations of tough odors like pet-related smells. The Tide pacs strike the balance between cleaner clothes and color retention, making them a winner for me, despite their slightly higher price tag.  

**Quality for Price**  
Are these pods worth the investment? Personally, I think Tide has justified their slightly premium stance with performance. You’re saving elsewhere (detergent, stain removers, color protectors—all packed in one), so it feels like a fair trade. Plus, the reliable results mean I didn’t have to re-wash loads, which is a hidden cost-saver. Still, if you’re shopping on a tight budget, it might be worth waiting for sales or promotions to make these pods a bit easier on your wallet.

I’m looking to start a coffee roasting company in India, but I’m a bit stuck on the realities of the market. Green coffee prices (especially AAA, AA) are at an all-time high, and MOQs are tough for someone just starting out. Margins seem really tight, and it’s making me question how viable this is.

There’s also a lot of competition — with so many solid roasters already (Bloom, Caarabi, Rosette, etc.), why would cafés or offices switch to someone new, even if the quality is great?

If you’ve been in this space or have thoughts on how to carve out a niche and overcome these early barriers, I’d genuinely appreciate your input. I’m passionate about coffee, but trying to be smart before taking the leap.

3. wala din naman ako masyado na kakamatch na hookups, luckily lahat sila convo convo muna even bago magpush ng meet up.

There is a particular species of existential dread unique to screenwriters, a quiet, gnawing terror that strikes precisely when you hit ‘Send’ on your final draft and realize you’ve just voluntarily strapped yourself to the rocket of someone else’s bad decisions. It is in this moment when the fragile illusion of creative control evaporates like the illusion of quality on the Netflix home screen, leaving only the bitter aftertaste of contractual reality.

Welcome to the **Bollywood Contractual Singularity**, a cosmic phenomenon where art, commerce, and creative dignity collapse into an infinitely dense point of exploitation. Here in this legal event horizon, words like ‘ownership,’ ‘payment,’ and ‘credit’ lose all meaning, warped beyond recognition by the gravitational pull of studio avarice. It is a place where:

* Originality goes to die (but is periodically resurrected for cheap remakes)
* Fair compensation is a mythological creature, like research in a Dharma film
* Your signature (or worse, DigiSign) becomes a ceremonial surrender of basic human rights

Consider this to be a **warning label** for the creative soul, the small print you wish you’d read before selling your cerebral cortex to the entertainment industrial complex.

Let us explore this bureaucratic dystopia through five acts of institutionalized absurdity, a *Bharadwajean* tragedy disguised as a standard writer’s agreement.

Fix yourself a drink. You won’t get reimbursed for it, but you may find spiritual compensation in its bottom third. Breathe deeply, adjust expectations (downwards, always downwards), and if you’re thinking about getting inked, might I suggest:

**On the Mandatory Relinquishment of Cerebral Property**  
**A Handbook for the Creatively Dispossessed**

There is a particular moment in every writer’s life when they make the catastrophic error of believing their thoughts belong to them. This delusion usually lasts right up until the instant they’re presented with a standard Bollywood contract, at which point they discover the horrifying truth: your imagination is merely a communal resource, much like a *Sulabh Sauchalaya*.

**The Contract** (*always capitalized, like the name of an eldritch horror from beyond time*) begins innocently enough. There’s some pleasant boilerplate about parties and agreements that lulls you into a false sense of security. Then it gets to the meat of the matter, which isn’t so much meat as it is the suspicious unidentifiable bits that feel like meat but not really in a plate of chicken momos that may or may not linked to the waning population of street dogs in Versova.

What follows is a journey through the five circles of intellectual property hell, each more creatively punitive than the last:

1. **The Eternal Consent Agreement**  
The contract claims your work ‘*in perpetuity*,’ which sounds grand until you realize it’s a fancy way of saying ‘forever, and then some.’ Your script will belong to them longer than your bones will belong to you. Long after civilization has collapsed and the Earth has been consumed by the expanding sun, an alien archaeologist will unearth a copy of your contract and remark, ‘*Ah yes, this primitive life form clearly signed away all rights to their neural output in exchange for what appears to be a Veronica’s Pastrami Sandwich.*’

2. **The Franchise Offspring Non-Visitation Policy**  
Should your work spawn sequels, prequels, interquels, sidequels, or any other form of ‘-quels’ that hasn’t been invented yet, you will have exactly as much claim to them as Siddhant Chaturvedi has over Ananya Pandey’s dreams. There’s a special sub-clause that ensures any success will automatically trigger a mechanism to exclude you from benefiting from it, based on the fundamental principle that writers should only experience failure, never reward.

3. **Pan-Reality Exploitation Accord (Binding Across Reincarnations and Simulation Layers)**  
The contract lays claim to your work ‘*throughout the universe*,’ which seems excessive until you realize it’s the only part of the document showing any ambition. There’s also language covering ‘all media now known or hereafter invented,’ which means if someone develops a way to beam stories directly into people’s dreams, your work will be there, making money for someone else while you sleep.

4. **The Interpretive Vandalism Privilege**  
This is where you discover that your carefully crafted dialogue can be replaced by whatever the lead actor’s hair and make-up artist thinks would be more ‘*authentic*.’ That poignant character arc you spent months refining? It’s now a montage of the star doing shirtless pull-ups. The contract essentially states that your words are merely raw material, like clay or disappointment, to be shaped by anyone with more power and less talent than you.

5. **The ‘*****But Wait, There’s Less!*****’ Mechanism**  
Just when you think the rights grab can’t get more comprehensive, you find clauses covering merchandise (*you get nothing*), stage adaptations (*you get nothing*), theme park rides (*you get nothing*), and theoretical future technologies (*you get the distinct pleasure of knowing your work will be enjoyed by post-human cyborgs who will never know your name. also, you get nothing)*

**The Approved Procedure for Payment Disbursement**  
**(See Sub-Clause 47b for Why It Doesn’t Apply to You)**

The payment structure of a standard Bollywood writing contract is built on a financial model so deliberately confusing, even Anupama Chopra, who recently called *Jewel Thief-* ‘a film’, would struggle to spin it positively.

Let us examine this cosmic joke through its various stages of improbability:

**1.** **The Signing Amount Mousetrap (Or How 10% Becomes 100% of What You’ll Ever See)**

The initial payment- ***that tantalizing 10%*** (*plus GST minus TDS*) is the cheese in the mousetrap of your career. It arrives with surprising promptness, giving you the dangerous illusion that this time might be different. This is the financial equivalent of a first date showing up on time and showing interest in you, lulling you into false confidence about a happy ending before the inevitable disappointment. You celebrate by paying one-third of a month’s rent and heading over to Bayroute because why not?

**2.** **The ‘Story Approval’ Mirage (10%)**

The second tranche is ostensibly for ‘*story approval*’ which is the industry’s way of saying: *’We will now begin the process of systematically denying that this story ever resembled what we asked for.’*

You were hired to write **the director’s vision**, a story that supposedly sprang fully formed from his brilliant mind. And yet, when you deliver exactly that, a strange phenomenon occurs:

* **First Draft:** *’This is exactly what I wanted!’* (He says, before realizing he no longer wants it.)
* **Second Draft:** *’Hmm… I think we need to rethink the core concept.’* (The core concept being, of course, the one he insisted was non-negotiable.)
* **Third Draft:** Rethinks all characters.
* **Final Draft:** *’Actually, I’m not sure this is working. Let’s workshop it again.’*. The ‘workshop’ consists of the director’s girlfriend suggesting the hero should also be a vampire.

And so, the great paradox emerges:

>

The ‘approval’ is not a milestone, but a mirage, a shifting finish line that recedes into the distance every time you near it. By the time you finally collapse at what you’re told is the final version, the director will have moved on to a new obsession, the producer will have lost interest, and the story will be shelved, *not because it wasn’t good, but because it was never allowed to exist long enough to be anything at all.*

And yet, somehow, **you still won’t get paid the next installment until they approve it.**

**3.** **The Draft Purgatory (40% Across Infinite Revisions)**  
  
If by some black magic you actually get the story approved- *Congratulations*! You’ve now unlocked *Draft Purgatory*, where your script will be rewritten into oblivion by people who’ve never written a grocery list, let alone a screenplay*.* Karan Singh Tyagi’s theory of relativity states that time *like history* is flexible. Bollywood producers have expanded this principle to the very meaning of the word ‘*final*.’

* **First (*****Kinda Sorta*****) Final Draft (10%)**: You deliver what you believe is a complete script. The studio calls it a ‘*great starting point*’ which is like calling the Big Bang a *‘solid first attempt’* before the universe got rewritten by the committee.
* **Final Draft (10%)**: Now featuring the director’s sudden conviction that the second act needs a better hero entry, more depth to the primary love story, two more songs and a subplot about reincarnation.
* **Final Final Draft (10%)**: The studio’s notes arrive, penned by an intern who also happens to be the studio head’s daughter who once attended a guest lecture by Charlie Kaufman during her time at USC on the subject ‘*Character Arcs in an Uncaring Cosmos.***’** Your protagonist is now a *misunderstood antihero* who never loses a fight (because the star’s contract demands it).

· **Final Final Final Draft (10%)**: The actor’s spiritual guru, personal chef, and astrologer have all weighed in. The script now includes:

* An animated comic sidekick monkey
* A dream sequence shot in Slovenia
* A third-act twist that contradicts the first two acts and is narrated by the pet dog.

By this point, your original script is as recognizable as a photocopy of a photocopy of a doodle on a wet napkin

**4.** **The Principal Photography Paradox (10%)**

This payment triggers when cameras roll or more accurately, when the universe aligns to allow cameras to *almost* roll. Principal photography commences when:

* When the lead actor returns from Ananda in the Himalayas, remembers they signed this film, and agrees to show up for at least one day before leaving for a ‘prior commitment.
* The actress is still in recovery from her third round of ‘subtle tweakments’ which left her unable to move her forehead but is finally ‘camera-ready’
* The influencer (*funny-best-friend-to-the-female-lead-but-believes-she-should-be-lead-coz-you-know-followers*) is stuck in a vanity van refusing to come out until someone explains why her role ‘*isn’t as funny as the sketches she made to get cast’*
* The location in Istanbul has been abruptly relocated to Film City’s ‘Turkish Bazaar’ set after India’s latest wave of *‘Boycott Turkey’* WhatsApp nationalism, prompting the producer to loudly declare they *‘always planned to shoot in Mumbai’*
* The studio stops pretending this project isn’t just a tax write-off

This creates a Catch-33⅓:

* The star won’t start until paid
* The financiers won’t pay until the star starts
* And your 10% is trapped in escrow until both happen

Your money now exists in quantum superposition, both coming and not coming, also referred to as the *Guneet Monga Principle of Selective Liquidity*, which states that your cheque is simultaneously cleared and bounced until you open your NetBanking app, at which point it collapses into a ‘bank error’, a phenomenon that only affects those she can’t leverage for Instagram clout.

**5.** **The Post-Production Pay Postponement Protocol** **(PPPPP)** **(10%)**

* A payment triggered by the completion of shooting, which sounds straightforward until you realize:
* ‘*Finished’* is a theoretical concept, like ‘*happiness*’ or ‘a producer’s verbal *God promise*’
* The film will enter reshoots (because the star disliked their hero-entry).
* After rebooting his consciousness at a ‘*Vipassana retreat*’ in Kasol the director will experience a *divine revelation* that his film should, in fact, *mean something* and will demand you retrofit the entire third act around his new ‘*vision’*

Your payment, meanwhile, enters development hell, a limbo where invoices are neither approved nor rejected, just ‘*under review*’ by an accounts department that may or may not be a figment of your imagination.

**6. The Window of Release and Other Imaginary Openings** **(20%)**

The final payment is tied to release, a financial black hole where: ‘Coming soon’ means it’s not ***and*** The release date is either: Awaiting the perfect festival slot (i.e., no one will buy it) ***or*** ‘Realigning with the star’s next project’s promotions’ (i.e., they forgot this film existed) ***or*** ‘Strategic hold for market conditions’ (i.e., it’s terrible)

**The Ministry of Vanishing Recognition**  
**Why Your IMDb Page Will Always Be Wrong**

The credit system in Bollywood operates in a strange quantum state where your contribution is simultaneously vital enough to demand your complete creative surrender, yet insignificant enough to be erased from existence at the producer’s whim. This is the *Sameer Nair Credit Paradox*, your name both exists and doesn’t exist on the project until someone sends in a legal notice.

Let us examine the elaborate caste system of screen credits, arranged here in descending order of actual creative contribution and ascending order of likelihood to appear:

**‘Story by’ Credit (The First-Born Clause)**

* The rarest and most mythical of all credits
* Still gets demoted below the costume designer’s assistant in actual billing.
* Your name won’t appear on the poster, but if it does the studio will earn a glowing tweet from The Hollywood Reported India for ‘progress and inclusive filmmaking.’

**‘Screenplay by’ Credit (You May Clap for Yourself Now)**

* Means you actually wrote words that appeared on screen
* Often accompanied by 3–5 other names because what, you thought you did this alone?
* Will be displayed in 4pt font during the closing crawl
* Guaranteed to be misspelled in at least one official publication
* Your name won’t appear on the poster, but if it does the studio will earn a glowing tweet from The Hollywood Reported India for ‘progress and inclusive filmmaking.’

**‘Dialogue by’ Credit (The Qualified Applause Mandate)**

* Translation: ‘We kept 12% of your actual words’
* Invariably shared with the star cause improvisation on set.
* Still considered too prominent and will be buried under ‘Second Unit Catering by’

**‘Additional Dialogue’ Credit (The Creative Witness Protection Program)**

* Means you wrote entire scenes that were used verbatim
* But the director’s cousin needs a favor so you’re being ‘*flexible’*
* Often precedes your transition to shifting back to the small-town you came from.

**‘Special Thanks’ (The Career Sunset Notification Form)**

* Appears right below the guy who trained the dog
* Reads as ‘We acknowledge your existence but deny your contribution’
* Often the only credit surviving the final cut of your dignity

A few additional principles that explain the credit hierarchy:

**Monika Shergill’s Law of Creative Invisibility**

When a project is presented by someone who matters, or originates from a studio that matters, the writer becomes a non-binding suggestion, an expendable input in a prestige packaging exercise.

Shergill’s Law is observable across multiple Indian originals wherein the absence of writer recognition correlates strongly with the presence of ‘*presenters*,’ showrunners by proximity, or legacy studios rebranding themselves as creative ecosystems. The actual writer, if acknowledged at all, is often cited only in backend metadata, screeners, or award ceremony misprints.

**The Entanglement Clause**

Your credit exists in a perpetual state of flux according to the following variables:

* If the film succeeds → More established names suddenly materialize as co-writers
* If the film fails → Your name grows disproportionately prominent
* If controversy arises → Your name becomes the only one on the press releases
* If awards are mentioned → Your name undergoes complete quantum erasure

**The Observation Distortion Provision**

You can either: Have your name prominently displayed on a terrible film ***or*** Have your name quietly removed from a good one. But never both, and often neither.

**The Elsewhere Acknowledgement Principle**  
  
Infinite parallel universes theory suggests: In some realities, your name appears exactly as promised. In others, it’s replaced by a typo. In most, it’s simply ‘A Film by \[Director Who Fired You After Draft Two\]’

**The Bureaucratic Event Horizon**

Once your credit enters the studio’s legal department: It may be stretched beyond recognition ***or*** It may be split into unrecognizable particles ***or*** It may disappear into a contractual black hole. But it will never, ever emerge intact

**The Grand Unified Theory of Why This Keeps Happening**

The entertainment industry maintains this byzantine credit system because:

* It creates plausible deniability for quality
* It feeds the industry’s endless appetite for petty power plays
* It maintains the illusion that writing is a communal activity rather than an act of individual creation that must then survive a gauntlet of corporate sabotage

**Epilogue: The Final Dilution Protocol**

In the end, all writing credits tend toward maximum entropy:

* Names blur together
* Contributions become indistinguishable
* Everyone who actually worked on the project develops a drinking problem

The only way to ensure your name stays on a project is to make it so terrible that no one else wants to be associated with it. This is known as the ‘***Credit Conservation Principle****’* which states- *the worse the film, the more likely you’ll be properly credited for it.*

**The Morality Clause Will See You Now**

The morality clause in entertainment contracts is a masterpiece of legal sadism, a document so absurd it makes the BMC’s schedule for road repair before the monsoons seem reliable. These clauses exist in that special intersection between corporate paranoia and creative control, where the studio’s right to judge your character is only exceeded by their complete lack of having any themselves.

1. **The ‘*****Bringing Disrepute’*** **Provision**

* Definition: Anything that might make a studio executive have to answer questions about you, starting with ‘Who is \[insert writer’s name\] this again?’
* Examples: Expressing political opinions, being photographed with the wrong people, or wearing socks that clash with the corporate ethos

2. **The ‘*****Conduct Unbecoming*****’ Clause**

* Translation: Conduct unbecoming of a peasant who should be grateful for scraps
* Includes: Asking for fair pay, complaining about working conditions, or looking at a producer the wrong way during notes

3. **The ‘*****Social Media Minefield*****’ Addendum**

* Where your entire career can be vaporized by: A retweet from 2012 ***or*** A like on a controversial meme ***or*** An emoji that could be interpreted as problematic if viewed through the right prism of paranoia.

4. **The Breathtaking Scope of ‘*****Prohibited Activities*****’**

* Under standard morality clauses, you cannot: Have opinions ***and/or*** Change opinions ***and/or*** Fail to have the correct opinions at the correct time ***and/or*** Exist in a way that might potentially, someday, under certain lighting conditions, maybe cause someone somewhere to think negative thoughts about the studio

5. **The Kafkaesque ‘*****Enforcement Mechanism’***

* Your name becomes unmentionable in industry circles
* Existing contracts mysteriously evaporate
* Your agent (*if you have one*) will suddenly develops amnesia about your existence

6. **The Indemnity Inferno**

* *‘The Writer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Producer, Studio, Director, Lead Actor, their third cousins, and their spiritual gurus from and against any and all claims, damages, FIRs, social media outrage, political party meltdowns, citizen petitions, plagiarism lawsuits and/or existential dread arising from the Script, even if said Script was edited beyond recognition by parties who’ve never read it.’*
* Which translates to: You are now the fall guy for: Social Media Lynch Mobs ***and/or*** All Police Complaints/FIRs ***and/or*** Court Cases & Bail Hearings ***and/or*** Plagiarism Outcries ***and/or*** Creative Bankruptcy
* Which translates to: The writer’s fee will be held in escrow for potential ‘*damages settlements*.’

What makes these clauses particularly exquisite is their selective enforcement. While the writer is busy being crucified, an A-list star can: Get arrested for actual crimes ***or*** Start a cult that sacrifices humans ***or*** Engage in financial fraud so blatant it would make Deepak Dhar blush ***and*** still keep working because ‘*the show must go on*’ (and more importantly, the profit must keep flowing)

**Conclusion: The Moral Posturing Convergence Point**

We’ve reached a point where:

* Actual criminal behavior is forgivable if you’re important enough
* But a writer’s social media history must be purer than the driven snow
* And must remain so in perpetuity, across all possible timelines and alternate universes

**Clause Encounters of the worst kind**

There exists in this industry a certain kind of process, not quite legal, not quite rational, but undeniably *theatrical* in its cruelty. It begins with the illusion of resolution: a promise murmured over coffee, a sympathetic nod, the solemn invocation of *next week, definitely*. But this is merely the opening gambit, the first turn of a screw that will tighten with bureaucratic precision until all hope has been neatly excised. What follows is a dance of delays, deflections, and expertly weaponized incompetence, a labyrinth with no center, only exits marked *settle* or *surrender*. Here lies the machinery of disappointment, a play in 7 acts.

1. **Act One: False Hope** The process commences with the ceremonial invocation of *amicable resolution*. This is the phase in which the aggrieved party (henceforth, *The Writer*) raises a concern, typically the non-receipt of contractually agreed-upon compensation.  In response, the Producer Entity (hereinafter referred to as *The One Who Will Ghost You by Next Tuesday*) deploys a combination of feigned astonishment, vague sympathy, and reference to an all-powerful but conveniently faceless entity known only as *Accounts*.  At this stage, time ceases to function linearly. ‘*Payment by Friday*’ is uttered with such conviction and regularity that it becomes an abstract concept, more myth than metric, existing alongside quality cinema from Maddock, honest film credits, and the original screenplay draft. 
2. **Act Two: The SWA Mediation** Should false hope be insufficiently effective (and it generally is), the Writer may wake up, pray to the altar of Anjum Rajabali and escalate the matter to the Screenwriters Association (SWA), a body that exists.  This phase of mediating via union resembles a street theatre performance staged at a heavily delayed NGO fundraiser: well-meaning, faintly poetic, but ultimately lacking in statutory teeth.  The mediation concludes with what can only be described as a *suggestion*, cloaked in conciliatory legalese and wrapped in a moral appeal to ‘*good faith*.’ The Producer Entity, now invoking the noble principles of creative chaos, generally agrees to *something non-specific*, which is followed by *nothing actionable*. 
3. **Act Three: The Legal Notice** Driven to desperation, the Writer seeks legal recourse. This involves engaging counsel, ideally one who charges less per hour than the original script fee. The counsel, upon reviewing the documentation, which typically includes an unsigned MOU, an ambiguous email trail, and one PDF that won’t open, advises immediate surrender.  The Writer proceeds regardless. A formal legal notice is dispatched. Silence follows.  Then, without warning, a counter-notice materializes. An 800-page document composed in archaic font, citing obscure clauses, and implying the Writer owes the Producer both money and an apology for dreaming.  At this point, the Writer’s soul exits the body temporarily. 
4. **Act Four: The Litigation** Should the Writer persist; actual litigation is initiated. However, in a twist even the most experimental screenplay wouldn’t dare attempt, the matter is summarily referred to *arbitration*, a process less ‘*dhai kilo ka haath* and more ‘*Chaitanya Tamahne LoFi*.’  The court, eager to avoid cluttering its dockets with frivolities like *justice*, insists on the arbitration route. This sends the Writer spiraling into the next act. 
5. **Act Five: The Arbitration** Now formally broke, the Writer must pay a retired judge to listen to the case. A year passes. Proceedings are delayed due to weddings, monsoons, and a general cultural aversion to promptness.  When it does occur, arbitration is less a verdict and more an expensive conversation with intermittent snacks. It ends with the Arbitrator suggesting an out-of-court *settlement*, often delivered in a tone that implies the Writer is lucky not to be sued for existing. 
6. **Act Six: The Settlement** By now, the Writer’s resolve has withered into a manageable paste. A compromise is proposed. The amount agreed upon is less than the original invoice, minus legal fees, minus the emotional cost of explaining this to one’s parents.  The Writer accepts.  Because closure, even the hollow, clattering kind, is a form of peace. 
7. **Act Seven: Institutional Gaslighting** Following the settlement, the Writer receives unsolicited philosophical commentary from the Producer Entity and associated ecosystem.  These include but are not limited to:‘*This is just how the industry works.*’‘*You should have known better.*’‘*Maybe next time don’t be so emotional.*’

**Epilogue: The M.C. Escher Clause**

Like one of M.C. Escher’s impossible staircases, the system’s true genius lies in its recursive injustice — a labyrinth where every step forward deposits you back at the beginning of your indignity. Zoom in on any clause, any email thread, any arbitration hearing, and the same cruel geometry repeats itself with mathematical precision.

* The writer pays
* The writer loses
* The writer ascends an endless flight of legal steps only to find themselves kneeling at the base again, apologizing for the disturbance

It is a closed ecosystem of fault, self-sustaining and perpetually hungry. And when the cycle completes, as it always must, you will find yourself exactly where you began: staring at a blank page, drafting an invoice you know will never be paid, wondering if the problem was never the system at all but your own stubborn faith that it could be bargained with.

(couldnt sleep till 3am-ish and in the meantime i kept thinking weird things).

Saw weird symbolism in things and then it kinda went to just my brain going to a weird place again throught the night. Not sure wtf happened. I was also extremely hungry

I'll admit the tea has been tasting weird but like I live at home with my parents, only have gone to church with them like once lately.

Not sure wtf happened last night. Went back to realizing i was in some simulation and that i needed to leave and hey just occasional paranoia, didnt sleep till 4pm (felt wide awake) but woke up at like 9 feeling absolutely tired.

Was worried earlier in the evening that my mental health was getting bad again but that was just bizzare. I feel a bit better after waking up. I don't actualy do any drugs or anything. I've been having a cup of coffee a day and assumed that i was just picking at my skin which caused increased dopamine.

Also i've been feeling motivated more which is great! So idk why tf my mental health just plummeted throught the evening like that.

I also had a bunch of paranoia that i was being drugged while my paranoia was at its worse and coffee made it worse but like I was past the whole ""weird ideas thing"" idk why they came back up like that.

i dont get what made my mental health go from getting better to really bad overnight and then back to getting better after i woke up.

...i had some medical issue once and my mom was weirdly against me going to a doctor for it cause ""reasons"" yet she goes to doctors for things too sometimes(i figured it was just general not wanting to go to a doctor/not needing to).

...really wanted me to try this herbal remedy for something. (was some vitamin drink that shes had me try before). Previously was paranoid my dad was messing with me but now idk (she also is entirely against me moving out... welp. Also acting weirdly understanding about me failing classes idk whats going on). We also had some arguing the morning prior.

1kr4f0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kr4f0r/why_choose_glacier_fresh_gf009x_refrigerator/,Why Choose GLACIER FRESH GF009X Refrigerator Water Filter Review for Cleaner Water?,"The **GLACIER FRESH GF009X Replacement for RPWFE Refrigerator Water Filter** quickly became a staple in my kitchen routine, and I’ve got some thoughts to share after testing it extensively. It’s designed for specific GE French-door refrigerators and promises premium filtration by removing contaminants like heavy metals, chlorine, and sediment while keeping the beneficial minerals intact. With a six-month filter life, this gadget claims to change the game in providing clean, fresh-tasting water. But as with any product, there are some ups and downs to weigh before diving in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is how compact and streamlined this filter is. Measuring at just 1""x1""x1"", it’s lightweight but feels robust in hand. The carbon fiber material gives off a premium vibe, which fits well considering its NSF certification. There’s clearly thought put into ensuring compatibility with a range of GE refrigerator models. It snaps into place easily, though the real test was in seeing how it held up after weeks of extended use. Not once did I have to worry about leaks, which has been an issue with some knock-off filters I’ve tried in the past.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing the product was surprisingly hassle-free. My mornings are chaotic, and I can’t afford time fidgeting with complicated setups. It took me under five minutes to replace my old filter. The instructions were clear, and the click-lock mechanism worked without a hitch. No additional tools were needed, and even someone like my tech-averse aunt could manage it solo.

**Upsides**  
- Effectively removes impurities and improves water taste.  
- Maintains beneficial minerals for health-conscious users.  
- NSF-certified for added trust and reliability.  
- Quick and simple installation process.  

[Check GLACIER FRESH GF009X price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c8ncf34j/)  

**Water Quality and Filtration Performance**  
Taste is king when it comes to water filters, and this one did not disappoint. After two weeks of use, I genuinely noticed the difference. Gone was the faint chlorine tang I had gotten used to, and out came crisp, refreshing water that even made my daily coffee taste better. The filter works by adsorbing impurities rather than releasing carbon powder, so no black specks floating around—a plus that’s often overlooked. It held strong even after churning through multiple gallons a day, thanks to a busy household of five. 

**Six-Month Longevity**  
Here’s something I’m really thankful for: the six-month filter life. A lot of competitors promise similar lifespans but fall short halfway through. I’ve stretched this one close to 300 gallons, and it still delivered the same consistent performance as day one. For families like mine who drink and cook with filtered water daily, this is a key benefit.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to GE models; it’s not versatile across brands.  
- May not last six months in extremely high-usage households.  

**Noise and Operational Efficiency**  
Some filters make annoyingly loud whooshing sounds during operation, especially when there's a high water flow. This one surprised me by being impressively silent. Whether you’re refilling a bottle or running water for cooking, the filter’s operational steadiness stood out. However, I would recommend checking if your refrigerator model has high compatibility, as improperly fitted filters can sometimes sputter.

**Alternative Offerings**  
There are plenty of water filters on the market, but none have hit the sweet spot for me quite like this one. Compared to the GE RPWFE filters—its direct competitor—it offers equally good filtration at a more affordable cost. That said, if you’re not tied to a GE fridge, you might find even broader options with brands like EveryDrop or PUR. But for GE users, the seamless compatibility and reduced chances of leaks make this an easy preference. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
What stood out during my testing phase was how much value this provides for anyone prioritizing their drinking water’s quality. While it might not be the cheapest option out there, the NSF certification and consistent performance justify the investment. Plus, considering I no longer need to purchase bottled water for taste improvements significantly cuts down on long-term expenses.

* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

1kr4d8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1kr4d8w/sb_experience_in_perth_west_australia/,"SB Experience in Perth, West Australia","So I rejoined seeking arrangements after my long term relationship and i’m instantly reminded of why I gave up in my earlier years.
I’m 25, I consider myself to be very attractive and well put-together. I’m confident, smart, bubbly and sweet.

I start having an amazing conversation with a guy (60f), so good that we take it off SA. We’re connecting and agreeing on all the same things (key words like mutually beneficial, spoiling me etc). I find him super attractive and likeable and we arrange to meet. He wants to take me out on his boat for a night but I talked him down to a coffee to confirm the connection.

We have an amazing time, even kiss at the end, and i’m really gearing up like not only is this man sexy and funny and cool but i’ve been lucky enough to get the real deal on the first go! We didn’t even get time to discuss details bc we had so much fun.

Later tonight, we are sending saucy messages and I get the impression he wants a photo. We’re planning to go on a boat date this weekend. I politely say:

“I would love to send you some photos of me but I don’t want to yet devalue myself 😘 I’ll need an incentive before I can be totally open. I hope you understand and that makes sense x”
He asks for clarification, I say:
“Well I’m loving our connection and chemistry so although it is easy to forget my reasons for being on SA, I don’t want to underestimate my value. I flourish when i’m stress free and feeling looked after financially. Maybe I didn’t make that clear enough sorry but I was just totally enjoying our time together. 
As much as I want to send you photos I want a longer term connection and I absolutely hate asking for money, but I would hope that you would want to make me feel special and valued x
You may not want to until we are intimate and that’s okay, photos are just a part of that intimacy for me 😇”

Fucking IMPLOSION. We start speaking explicitly and all of a sudden “He’s not an ATM, that’s not what he’s looking for” etc. Acting like i’m crazy and he won’t “pay for intimacy”. That he’s never given money to anyone he’s met off the site he just offers them the chance to go out on his boat once a week and relax in a “bubble”. Totally making me feel like i’m a bad person?

Apparently going on the boat once a week is what some girls are looking for on SA. I would love that. But how can I enjoy and relax on the boat when I need to pay my bills. Having some financial assistance makes me more available to YOU. You get a drama-free, earnest and totally committed relationship, with no strings attached or expectations. Having an incentive doesn’t mean i’m not attracted to you or value your time. 

Am I wrong for assuming that being on SA means you are looking for a sugar relationship?

I’m just in WTF mode now. I want to give up already because this has totally spun me out. Advice welcome. Anecdotes from successful SB’s in perth australia also welcome and appreciated. I struggle to be in a SR if i’m not attracted to the person so am I doomed?",3,1747746298.0,sugarlifestyleforum,8,1.0,False

This is my Second Post Here, as I am relatively new to the topic of Starseeds and this sub. I would Like to share Something that Happened today to me.  Excuse me If maybe my Text i grammatically is Not perfect, english is Not my native language and i am Not a fan of pure ChatGPT Text Outputs as i think It Takes away our Personal Essence which comes thru Us via own written texts- anyway. 

I Had today a very Strange experience with a Stranger in the grocery Store. I was shortly before i Had to head to Office in the Supermarket to Grab a Drink/Snacks. I was a bit in a hury- when suddenly next to me a Girl/woman appeared while i was searching for my favorite snack in the shelves. She was about 17-21years old, hard to guess her exact age, but at least 10-15 years Younger than me, she was Kind of a goth girl, she Had this alternative goth Like Style. She looked very intensely in my Eyes and kept multiple Times coming Close to me. Later I realised she spoke a foreign languages with an older Woman (maybe her Mom?). I think It was Russian, but likely a slavic language.  I Had immediatly a weird Feeling of ""familiarity"" the Moment she looked at me. I have to Point Out here, that from my Side there was No Feelings of sexual/romantic Attraction or anything Like that. 
But I Had this intense Feeling of ""Attraction/familiarity"" towards Here, as If I knew her. I dont know what she was thinking/Feeling but she were looking again and again towards me and Came multiple Times very Close to where I was looking for my grocery items. Always when she was Close I Kind of felt an ""Energy"" and for whatever Reason i Had the word ""Warrior"" in my head the Moment she looked at me. Its very hard to explain, despite she was (probably) a Teenager and much Younger than me, i felt an almost overwhelmingly presence of what I only can describe as wisdom/Love/Clarity. 

The weirdest Shit is, that since I left the Store everything i Touch i get small electrical shocks, at the Car, my clothes, the Doors, my PC, my Phone. Even the Coffee Powder somehow behaves weird, as If It is magnetically charged, It stays on my hands, hairs and also on the Sidewalls of my Coffee Box and even the Coffeefilter. Totally weird, It never did this. Maybe i am Just loosing my sanity at all now😅

I want to Note again: It wasnt any Kind of sexual Attraction or romantic Feelings that i felt. But It was an intense Attraction combined with Feelings of inexplainable sympathy/empathy/familiarity. 
Like what I would feel for my sister when i didnt See her for Long time, nothing what I feel when i am romantically/sexually attracted to a woman. But I can say with 100% I never saw this Girl ever before. It was absolutely weird. 

I have No Idea what she was thinking or Feeling as We didnt spoke a word, but she was almost staring at me at Times. 

My questions are

-  does anyone of you Have Had similar experiences with completely Strangers?
- And what was this ""Empathic"" Feelings that overcame me? Is this Somekind of Telepathy? 

I have Had experiences my whole Life- regarding premonition Dreams, ESP and other weird stuff which Most people Not even would think about Happening Out there, but Something Like this, with another human i never Had and i never Had anything Close what I would describe as telepathic experience in any way. I am Happy for anyone Who Has an Idea what Happened there and to hear about your inexplainable experiences with completely Strangers. ",3,1747746293.0,starseeds,0,1.0,False

1kr4b83,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1kr4b83/struggling_with_weight_loss/,Struggling with weight loss,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on weight fluctuations. I’m a 24 year old female with a hight of 5’5 and currently weighing 10.12 stone. 

Since Christmas I’ve lost 5 pounds and managed to keep that off however, I’m still not at my goal weight (10 - 10.3). For the last month my weight has been fluctuating from 10.9 to 10.12 but I don’t understand why. According to my Apple Watch I’m burning a minimum of 500 calories a day and sticking to a deficit of 1,000-1,200 calories a day for the last 5 weeks. 

Yes I’ve had the occasional cheat days (McDonalds) but stayed within my deficit. Honestly, I don’t each much in the day (couple of rice cakes or Ryvita) and have my main meal around 6pm, I frequently use the slow cooker with meals I’ve found on tik tok that are purely for staying in a deficit. If it matters I have one coffee everyday, drink lots of water and usually have one Diet Coke with my main meal purely to make me feel fuller. 

I am overthinking things and just not being patient enough or am I doing all the wrong things? Last year I lost nearly 3 stone and it came off pretty fast so I’m disappointed with the fluctuations I’m experiencing now. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks guys x

I wrote down the exact lyrics from that video and we searched it on Google, but with 0% success. We asked the ones who ""found the song"" but they said ""it had no title."" FYI we're in the Philippines, so even they didn't get an exact result due to the limited database here.

It's sung by a female artist and it had backup singers which I think were two males. It has this rock genre and I've got a feeling it is set in the 1980's or somewhere near that year range. Definitely has an electric guitar solo and I think within the first few seconds it's just instruments playing. I think the BPM is around 90 - 130 because the lyrics were sung partially slow. Genre, I think is Rock. Might be Pop but there's certainly little to no synths.

Here's the lyrics:  
""Ring the bell at the start of another round   
knock me out let my head hit the ground   
don't bet on me i'll only let you down   
if im so lost where is our love bell   
  
here we go again

ride the high and burn out in the crash   
fragile heart will break a golden glass   
if this love then will sorrow pass""

Whatever happens to my body during my period should be studied by theologians, not doctors. These aren’t just poops, they’re celestial wrath made flesh. My colon clenched like a nun reading A Court of Thorns and Roses in public. Never in my life have I felt personally victimized by my own rectum. My butthole didn’t just open the gates of Hell, it filed the paperwork, rang the bell, and asked if Hades was free for a coffee. I wasn’t pooping, I was passing through realms. I truly believed I’d end up as a footnote in some ancient scripture. “Here lies Pershitphone who evacuated her soul and saw the Devil blink.” 

So if I disappear for two days every month, no, I’m not busy or sad or meditating. I’m just negotiating with God, Satan, and my lower intestine in a standoff that ends with me flushed, broken, and googling “how much blood loss counts as legally dead.” Respect the absence. It’s self-preservation.

Here’s how the game works…

First, crack open the [Lovable](https://honeysyed.com/lovable). This isn’t one of those “drag and drop” wannabes. You’re feeding it a prompt, and it’s spitting out code, design, copy, forms, and pricing, all in one shot.

Your prompt needs to be specific. Something like: 

“Build a course sales page for a backyard chicken workshop. Include pricing, testimonials, FAQ, and Stripe checkout.”

That’s it. You click a button. The AI builds everything: 

* Page layout
* Copywriting
* Testimonial sections
* Pricing tables
* Stripe/cart integration placeholders
* Application forms
* Even full app logic if you need it

From there, just plug in your logos, swap out images (Google Maps works great for local sites), drop in real testimonials, and it’s yours.

Here’s where it gets spicy…

You can use this same flow for just about every digital business model out there: 

* Lead gen funnels (solar, roofing, charter jets)
* Ebook/course pages
* Workshop & mastermind landers
* Local business homepages
* Agency/consulting sites
* Mini PPC/SEO sites with ROI calculators
* Functional AI apps (hooked to OpenAI + Stripe)
* Niche directories with tiered listings

And if you’re smart, you’re not just making sites for yourself…

You’re recording quick Loom demos of what the AI built and sending them to dentists, churches, realtors, and restaurants. 

“Hey, made this for you, want it for $500?” 

Zero pressure. Zero pitch. Just value.

You could crank out 10 of these demos in a weekend and easily walk away with $2K–$5K in sales by Monday.

[Lovable](https://honeysyed.com/lovable) even builds full-blown apps. Like a Bible Q&A tool that captures emails, limits queries, and monetizes through Stripe. Prompt the idea, it builds the logic. You just connect it to OpenAI and Stripe, and you’re live.

Same with directories. Prompt the tool to generate listing pages, filters, payment tiers, and a full signup flow. Free → Premium → Certified. Done.

And when it’s time to scale, you lean on two things: 

1. Twitter (post samples, tag niches, go semi-viral)
2. Cold email with Looms (volume game, 15–30/day)

Everything runs off these few tools: 

* Lovable (or your AI builder of choice)
* Stripe
* Loom
* OpenAI API
* Google Maps/Canva/CapCut for polish

Websites in 8 minutes. $500 price point. App logic and design auto-baked. Some are using this to pull tens of thousands from just one niche workshop funnel.

Let me know if you want the actual plug-and-play prompt templates, local site, course page, directory, app, I’ll write them out so you can just copy/paste and hit “Go.”

Bride stated she wanted something fun, but low key. Said she’s not really into drinking anymore (thank God, neither am I) and just wanted to have relaxing weekend.

Anyways, it’s night 2 and bride states she wants to go out to the bars. We all abide and get dressed, head out. Nooww we’re in our late twenties, and not really into the bar scene anymore. And a majority of us are struggling with money as is, and this destination is proving to be expensive ($15-18 drinks)…with that being said we all have about 2 drinks (while the bride is slamming drinks) Bride keeps telling us we need to drink more. She said to me, “you don’t need to worry about your little bf, who cares, have some drinks, you know you want to” (she knows that I have quit drinking for like a year now as I don’t like the hangovers/how it makes me feel. We used to go out all the time, but we were much younger and immature) She said to one of the other girls “I don’t want to to hear the drinks are too expensive, you just bought a new car so I know you have the money.” We were out dancing with her and smiling, but after a while it’s just hard to have fun because she keeps making rude comments. 

Anyways, around 12:45am we get in an uber and head home. She starts loudly saying, “can you play some lullabies because my bridal party just wants to sleep and I’m ready to party. I’ll just head back to the bars by myself.” So we respond, “if you’d like to head back to the bars we’ll go with you!” She quickly responds “no, I don’t want to go with you guys. I’ll just hang out with some cute guys there then.” (Umm what, you’re getting married?”) She then Facetimes her fiancé and is loudly telling him “yeah my bridal party is being shitty” and hes sounding annoyed and told her to “go to bed it’s 1am”

So we get to the house, I’m the lucky one that shares a bedroom with the bride. And she’s slamming around the room and won’t even look at me or talk to me. It’s extremely awkward. 

Next morning, we wake up (later than expected due to the long night, missing the brunch reservations I had made for us all) We all head into to town to find food, but of course most places have a long wait or need reservations. One of the girls suggested we stop by a coffee shop and get quick breakfast and find food a little later. Bride agrees. But as we’re standing in line, I’m noticing she seems mad. She gets a bagel, but then throws it in the trash and says “nevermind, since no one wants to do what I want I’m going to find somewhere to eat by myself.” We end up being hungry and waiting in a 2 hour line at a restaurant to get expensive mediocre burgers like the bride wanted. 

The next night, bride states she wants to go out again, but this time wants everyone to drink with her. One girl responds “well the reason is that drinks are expensive and I can’t afford it.” Bride says “ok well then your PUNISHMENT is frozen pizzas tonight and that will save you some money for drinks.” This night ended up being about like the night before.

This is a long story, but there were a lot of rude comments made and this has tainted my view on our 7 year friendship. I’m really thinking after this wedding I don’t want much to do with her anymore.

As a chef who's spent years battling food waste in professional kitchens, I've finally found a home solution that delivers professional results without hogging counter space. After putting the FoodSaver PowerVac Compact Vacuum Sealer through its paces, I'm genuinely impressed by this mighty little machine.

## The Space-Saving Design That Actually Works

Unlike those bulky horizontal sealers that take up half your workspace, this vertical beauty stands upright like a small coffee maker, blending seamlessly into your kitchen aesthetic. For apartment dwellers or anyone with limited counter real estate, this design is nothing short of brilliant.

The sleek black and silver finish looks professional, and the controls are intuitively positioned on top for one-handed operation. I was sealing bags within minutes of unboxing—no culinary degree required!

## Performance That Surprised Me

Let me be clear: this compact machine punches well above its weight class. I've tested it with everything from delicate berries to marinated proteins:

- **Fresh produce:** Berries that typically turn to mush in days stayed firm for over a week
- **Meal prep:** I sealed several salmon portions with different marinades, and each tasted freshly seasoned when defrosted weeks later
- **Bulk ingredients:** Coffee beans, grains, and spices maintain their aromatics significantly longer

The vacuum strength is impressive, quickly extracting air and creating tight, reliable seals. Yes, very moist foods occasionally need a second attempt, but that's standard for this price range.

## Quick Specs Breakdown

| Specification | Details |
|:--------------|:--------|
| Dimensions | 6.5 x 10.6 x 5.7 inches |
| Weight | ~4 pounds |
| Power | 120V |
| Warranty | 1-year limited |
| Included | 1 Quart bag, 1 Gallon bag, 11""x10' roll of material |
| Compatibility | All FoodSaver bags, rolls, and accessories |

## The Chef's Assessment

### What I Love:
* Space-saving vertical design that actually stays on my counter
* One-handed, intuitive operation perfect for busy cooking sessions
* Surprisingly powerful vacuum that properly seals even challenging foods
* Removable, dishwasher-safe drip tray (crucial for marinated items)
* Progress indicator lights that eliminate guesswork
* Relatively quiet operation compared to industrial models
* Excellent value for the functionality

### What Could Be Better:
* Sometimes needs multiple attempts with very moist foods
* No built-in bag cutter (minor inconvenience)
* Starter kit is minimal—budget for more bags
* Slightly slower than premium models for bulk jobs

## Who Benefits Most?

**Beginner home cooks:** Perfect entry-level unit with simple operation and reasonable price point.

**Regular meal-preppers:** Ideal if you batch cook on weekends but have limited space.

**Budget-conscious cooks:** Extends food life significantly without breaking the bank.

**Small households:** Right-sized for individuals or couples who want to reduce waste.

## Chef's Tips for Maximum Value

1. Pre-freeze very moist items for 30 minutes before sealing for better results
2. Use the machine for more than just freezer storage—seal pantry items like nuts and coffee
3. Try marinating in the sealed bags—flavors penetrate in half the time
4. For delicate items like crackers or chips, use the manual seal function without full vacuum
5. Stock up on bags when they're on sale—they're the ongoing expense

After saving numerous meals from freezer burn and extending the life of expensive ingredients, this compact FoodSaver has earned permanent residence on my counter. The money I've saved by reducing waste has already paid for the machine several times over.

The following story contains themes of intense racial discrimination and fetishization. Please do not proceed further if you find these themes unappealing or intolerable.

The problem responsible for creating the Program (aside from the obvious) is a demographic one. There's a serious mismatch between the number of unmarried women of Asian heritage in the U.S. and the number of unmarried white men willing to marry an Asian woman out of pity or sacrifice.

Asian-American men were not having the same issue. There's a glut of unmarried, liberal, white women across America who are eager to prove their progressive bona fides by selflessly marrying a persecuted minority. As could be expected, these women were figuratively trampling each other to document their selflessness online, with tiktoks and instagram posts and long facebook rants about how they stepped up and took one for the team by hitching their wagon to a helpless AAPI man. Nevermind that many of these women undoubtedly got the better end of the deal, bagging themselves a man who had found success in some industry or another and could support a better lifestyle than they had ever enjoyed before on their meager salary as an elementary school teacher or librarian or feminist coffee shop barista.

With white men, however, things were different. Sure, there were plenty who, whether out of the goodness of their heart or just seizing an opportunity, committed themselves to an Asian-American woman in need. Quickly though, those good-hearted men dried up, and the rest realized they had never been more in-demand.

The Program, as it had come to be known, was not really a program at all. At least, not in any formal capacity. There was no funding, no oversight, no connection to an official organization - government or otherwise - which was responsible for its administration. Rather, it was a colloquialism assigned to a broader societal phenomenon. The name had come from, of all things, a conspiracy theory which had picked up a massive head of steam online in the early days of the war.

Some idiot or troll unknown had published a conspiracy theory that the U.S. government had established a covert program to select the most quintessential Aryan men from the various branches of the armed forces to comprise a special unit with the responsibility of breeding as many American women of Chinese heritage as possible. The idea being that, if the children of an entire generation of Chinese-American women were half white and carrying the genes of America's finest, most patriotic group of young men, then these women would be far less likely to spy for China during the war. It was a silly theory, really. For as many shady things as the government has done over the years, this was a bridge (or two or three) too far. But it captured the imaginations of many, and the name stuck around as society began to conform itself to exactly this preposterous narrative.

Soon after public opinion turned against Asian-Americans and the more liberal, bleeding-hearted man had married themselves off, competition for the remaining eligible men in America became fierce. Recognizing the position this put them in, white men could afford to be selective with who they picked, if they picked anyone at all. It became common for more desirable white men to be stringing along dozens of desperate Asian girls, pitting them against each other in a perverse tournament of sex and affection. It was a major correction from the environment of the 2020's, when white men had become society's punching bags, and we weren't going to let it slip away.

My Experience with Dutch Ladies in The Hague,"I’m a 38yo guy, average-looking, and I’ve been diving into the dating app scene here in the Netherlands over the past year. I’ve been lucky enough to get a ton of matches with Dutch women (shoutout to the awesome ladies here!), and I’ve met up with quite a few of them in person. Most dates have been great—coffee in The Hague’s cozy cafes, walks along Scheveningen beach, or just chilling in a pub. I’ve even kept in touch with some in various ways, from casual chats to planning more dates.
But here’s where I’m scratching my head. On a few occasions, I thought it’d be nice to bring a small gift to a first or second date—nothing big, just something simple like a single flower or a small box of chocolates, you know, to show appreciation and keep things sweet (pun intended). In my home country, this is pretty common and usually well-received. But I’ve noticed a pattern: the women I brought these gifts for didn’t seem to vibe with it, and a couple of them unmatched me or didn’t want a third date. Meanwhile, dates where I didn’t bring anything went much smoother, and some even led to ongoing connections.
Now I’m wondering: Is gift-giving on early dates a bit of a taboo in Dutch dating culture? Or is it just a coincidence? I’ve heard Dutch folks value directness and practicality, so maybe small gifts come off as too much too soon? Or could it be something else, like the type of gift (flowers, chocolates) or the timing? I’m starting to hold off on gifts altogether to avoid scaring anyone off, haha, but I’d love to hear your thoughts!
For context, I’m not Dutch, so I’m still learning the ropes of dating here. If you’re Dutch (or have dated in the Netherlands), what’s the deal with gifts in early dating? Are there unspoken rules I should know about? Any tips for navigating the dating scene in The Hague specifically?

About My Role:

* I manage a book of 100+ accounts totaling about $2.6 million in annual revenue.
* My primary focus is account retention and growth. Sales reps bring in new business, and then accounts are handed off to me for ongoing management.
* I handle:
   * Client relationship management
   * Contract renewals and redline reviews
   * Equipment and product upselling (i.e., premium water/coffee machines, snacks, paper goods)
   * Issue resolution (billing, delivery, service problems)
   * QBRs and onsite product/equipment demos
* Essentially, I serve as the main point of contact between our clients and internal departments, and I wear multiple hats on a daily basis.

Background:

* This is my second corporate job since graduating.
   * My first was in business development —very high-stress, quota-driven, and unstable.
* I’ve been in my current role for 2 years, and I really feel like I’ve found a career path that suits me—client-facing work, a mix of sales and service, and lots of room to grow skills.

The Dilemma: While I like the industry and my current role, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be undervaluing myself, especially considering the results I bring in.

Pros of My Current Role:

* Job security – Very stable position with minimal internal pressure.
* Strong company reputation – We dominate our local market and have high client satisfaction.
* Fun industry – Laid-back environment, cool events, lots of product exposure.
* No toxic culture – Unlike my last job, this one comes with peace of mind and work-life balance.

Cons:

* Base salary feels low – I currently earn \~65K in a high cost of living area. I do receive commissions on equipment sales, product placements, and contract renewals, but they vary.
* Feeling underpaid for the amount of responsibility – I manage high-value accounts, upsell regularly, and deal with everything post-sale.

What I Need Help With:

1. Career Advice
   * How can I progress from here? I love what I do as well as the employer I work for, but I’m unsure how to position myself for a promotion or pivot to a higher-paying role in a similar capacity.
   * Am I being too impatient or possibly ungrateful? Or is it fair to start looking elsewhere?

Any insights would be really appreciated—whether you're in Account Management, Customer Success, or Sales, I’d love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance!",1,1747744535.0,CustomerSuccess,0,1.0,False
1kr3qwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kr3qwa/home_cooking_vs_professional_cooking_a_short_essay/,"Home Cooking vs. Professional Cooking, A Short Essay","I'm writing this short essay to explain the difference between home cooks and professional chefs. The obvious answer is that professional chefs work professionally. However, the purpose of this missive is to provide aspirational cooks insight into the world of professional cookery, without all the late nights, cigarettes, and failed marriages.

I want to focus on small techniques, thought processes, and habits, that pro chefs use in order to elevate their cooking. It's not all high-end professional kitchens, robot-coupes, and paco-jets. The majority of it is just good habits.

As a former professional chef I'm often asked the question,

""What is your favourite type of cuisine to prepare?""

I find this question puzzling, as the person asking doesn't really gain much insight into what I did as a chef, nor do I gain much satisfaction from answering it. It can sometimes start a good conversation about good French or Arabic restaurants in town, but I feel that most people are missing an opportunity to ask a much more useful question.

""What are the little habits, practices, and techniques that separate home cookery from professsional chef work"".

Cooking is a series of actions which turn an ingredient or product into a finished dish. If we begin to break those actions down we see small differences and habits which result in a completely different whole. Here are a few of them.

1. Small Stuff (you can start doing this now):

\- Provenance and quality of ingredients is incredibly important. Many great restaurants have their own gardens, foragers, butchers, fishmongers, and even hunters. Cooking seasonally is important. Understand the place you live, and the type of food people ate there historically. I wouldn't want to be eating mud crab in Wisconsin in January.

Think about seasonality. Do you make a killer pork belly mac and cheese? I'm so proud of you. However, maybe think twice if you want to serve it during a mid morning summer brunch.

I find I save money cooking at home shopping at farmers markets buying in season produce, as opposed to mindless grocery shopping with fluoro lights and pop music playing.

\- Professional chefs believe in mis-en-place (MEEZ-uhn-plahs). We have everything the recipe requires in front of us. We avoid having to peel and chop an onion whilst our oil is already smoking (most of us anyway). Of course, sometimes things need to be done in the moment, but having everything chopped, grated, and prepared ahead of cooking is a great start.

\- Sharp knives. Sharp knives are safer. They are faster. I personally maintain that they are cleaner and more sanitary. They will produce the desired shape and consistency, more consistently.

\- Workflow setup. I've always used a food prep system requiring a sharp knife, cutting board, damp towel, and three equally sized containers. I'm right handed, so the container on the left contains the food that I am preparing, lets say carrots. The one in the middle contains waste (carrot butts, peels). The one on the right contains julienne carrots. This allows me to quickly move between tasks, stack my work and move about the kitchen if need be, and keep track of waste. This is a simple version of longer workflows that chefs setup depending on the task at hand. However, moving from left to right and raw to finished product is a sensible step. These systems help us work clean and fast. It also helps us reserve bits for stocks (more on this later).

2. Bigger Stuff (this might take a little time):

\-Stock. Restaurants worth eating in are using stock they are making from scraps. Roasted and simmered bones, aromatics, herbs, and vegetable scraps. These house stocks, on average, contain so much more flavour and character than ANYTHING out of a box. I really encourage any ambitious home cooks to go out to their butcher and ask for a bag of chicken frames, roast them off, simmer them slow, skim, strain, and taste the result. It will make an immaculate soup and reduce the longevity of your flu symptoms (NOT A DOCTOR).

Even more ambitious cooks should get veal bones, brown them in the oven on high heat, and let them simmer in a big pot for hours with vegetables, strain the liquid, reduce the results, add wine, and revel in the gelatinous flavourful glory. Add it to your Sunday spaghetti sauce whilst your hot influencer cousin drinks a $19 collagen latte.

\-Seasoning. This is a somewhat fraught word. ""seasoning"" in a professional culinary sense means addition of salt. Salt enhances flavour. It makes food taste more like itself.  However, dried spices certainly have their place. Professional chefs prefer to buy these ingredients whole (whole fennel, cumin, black pepper, dried chiles,). We roast them in a pan first to release oils, and then grind them fresh before adding to a dish. Its the difference between freshly ground coffee beans and pre-ground Folgers. Sunbeam makes a coffee/spice grinder that lives in pretty much every pro kitchen. I personally don't have much use for powdered spices in a professional setting. However, there are very high quality versions of most grocery store spice blends. I very often use za'tar from Arabic markets, and Spanish paprika of very high quality.

\-Fresh herbs. Flat leaf Italian parsley is something I use in my home cooking 3-4 times a week. I also grow chives, chervil, rosemary, oregano, and basil. This sort of ties into the seasoning part. The addition of fresh herbs is going to elevate any dish. Dried herbs from a jar will never begin to touch fresh herbs prepared well. You need a sharp knife to cut them. Dull knives will crush cell walls, making them bruised. They will taste of, and resemble, lawn clippings.

\-Use enough fat to cook things. Restaurants are notoriously liberal with things like butter and duck fat. Use these ingredients at your discretion but don't be afraid of them. Buy good butter also. The last time I was in the US I was shocked at the poor quality of butter compared to much of the world.

\-""Finishing"" a dish. With pretty much any dish there is a process that will occur once final cooking is done. This isn't ""garnish"", which suggests a purely aesthetic addition of colourful elements to the plate. In the simplest case of a soup, it would be at the desired consistency. We would season (add salt), and maybe fruit acid like lemon juice, or a vinegar like sherry vinegar for more savoury dishes.

\-Presentation is a fairly simple thing as far as I'm concerned. Use nice clean white plates. Black small round dishes are really nice for things like sashimi in a bar but unless you own a yakuza bar they won't look amazing. Everything looks good on white round plates. Never use square plates. They don't fit on the table for some reason even though the table has corners. I can't explain this. Someone who does geometry should explain this.

\- Present your food simply, give it a drizzle of good oil, some pepper, a bit of salt, some fresh herbs, and make sure its neat. Consider asymmetry, rule of threes, and colour, but never add colour for the sake of it. Tremendous presentation will progress as your cooking becomes more advanced. Don't consider plating before the basics and fundamentals of cookery.

3. Big Stuff: Cooking philosophy (lifetime)

At some point in most professional chef's careers they've begun to question why the fuck they're pursuing such a low paying and inglorious pursuit. The chef world has its celebrities that wax and wane but the majority of workaday guys and gals who do this work will never see fame, fortune, or even anything close to wealth. So why?

I understand there are people out there who see fine dining and say ""why?"" or ""that's not going to fill me up, I'm a big fella with a big belly and a brap-brap-brap I just like a cheeseburger"".  That's fine big fella! This isn't for you. Its just like muscle cars or pokemon or gundamns or football. Not everything is for everyone.

\-Home cookery is cooking to put food on the table. Professional cookery (the type I'm talking about) is about celebration, acknowledgement, entertainment, and pushing the limit of a practice that is ancient and modern. It is about participating in a constantly changing landscape of creative people dedicated to creating delicious moments that ultimately bring people together at a table. We can always apply this stuff to the home. In fact, it began in the home.

\-We take each individual step of the cooking process and break it down into its smallest components, and improve and refine each component for our specified purpose. We pay attention, slow down, drink wine, see everyone around us who loves us, and create plates for them to gobble up, talk over, raise a glass. I make dishes to thank people, to show appreciation, to express unity and togetherness.

\-I buy seasonally to get the the best ingredients I can, to suit the tastes of the people around me, and provide them with value that comes from my expertise. The ingredients may speak for themselves, but at the end of the day the chef makes them sing.",0,1747744476.0,Cooking,1,0.38,False

But if that’s true, then you were the author, my love.
All of my stories begin and end with you.

And one day, when they ask how we met—
when they ask when we knew—
when you don’t have the perfect words to tell them the story
of how we found each other,
how we broke and burned and rebuilt ourselves—
how, together, we overcame—

I’ll be there to remind you:
We never needed perfect.
We only needed each other.
And together is how our story will be told.
Together is how it was always meant to be heard.

Because together, you and I have the moments.
We have the words.
We have the lifetimes.
And best of all?

We have each other.

Before you, I had nothing.
After you, I had everything.
My story begins with you.

Do you remember the first thing I ever said to you?
How young and foolish I was back then…

(Don’t you dare tell them I’ve hardly changed.)

I barged in like a storm.
No hello. No softness. Just “Who are you?”
And still—you stayed.
Still—you saw me.

Even then…
I think some part of me already belonged to you.

Even before we shared the first glance,
there was something different about the way you made me feel.
And it’s a feeling I could never forget.
Because even now—after all this time—
you still make me feel it.

The first time I saw you only confirmed what we both already knew.
Something ancient.
Something written long before we had names to call each other.

A knowing that settled deep into my bones
the moment your eyes found mine.

I didn’t just recognize you.
I remembered you.

Even then, I think we understood:
This wasn’t a meeting.
It was a return.
Two souls, finally circling back
after lifetimes of echoing footsteps and almosts.

And my love...
you didn’t complete me.
You didn’t fix or rescue or remake me.
You reminded me.

Reminded me of who I was
when I wasn’t afraid to be seen.
When I wasn’t pretending I needed less than everything.

And you gave it to me—everything.
Not all at once,
but piece by piece.
Morning by morning.
Ritual by ritual.
Softness by sacred softness.

I never needed you to prove you were whole—
because I wasn’t either.
Not until you.

I think about that time you rolled over,
head propped on your elbow,
asking me questions you already knew the answers to...
and I couldn’t help but smile.

When I pulled you closer,
buried my face in the crook of your neck,
your arms tightened around me.
Do you remember how I left a trail of kisses along your neck,
all the way to your ear?

How when I whispered,
""Told you so, didn’t I?""
—your whole body reacted—
and in the best way?

I giggled wildly as we became a tangle of limbs and sheets.
I lived for those nights when you’d find me under our covers,
and I’d get lost in you.

I remember the first time I “serenaded” you—
how your eyebrows shot straight up,
and your face said “This woman is insane”
but oh, how we laughed.

Your laugh…
God, your laugh was magic.
And when I heard it,
my eyes filled with tears
because I knew—
I would do anything to hear that sound again.

You noticed.
Of course you did.

You crossed the distance in record time,
concern etched across your face,
your hands brushing away the tears.

You never ran from them.
Never flinched at my feelings.
You embraced them.
You embraced me.

After a lifetime of people backing away from how deeply I felt—
you stayed.
You loved me harder for it.

The small things—
our little day-to-day rituals—
they were my lifeline.

The silent conversations when our eyes would meet,
saying everything we couldn’t say out loud in those moments.
The busy mornings, quick kisses,
coffee mugs passed like batons in a track race.
The turning back for “just one more” kiss—
lips pressed to lips, whispering,
“I love you.”

It was everything.
You were everything.

And you were mine.
Always mine.

And now that we’re old—
now that time has marked our skin with the evidence of our journey,
looming overhead and reminding us our time is finite—

When that day comes…
I will have to go first.
Because there is no version of me that matters without you.
Because my story began with you.
And you are how my story ends.

1kr3gfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1kr3gfa/my_story_begins_with_you/,My Story Begins With You,"You say I am the story.
But if that’s true, then you were the author, my love.
All of my stories begin and end with you.

And one day, when they ask how we met—
when they ask when we knew—
when you don’t have the perfect words to tell them the story
of how we found each other,
how we broke and burned and rebuilt ourselves—
how, together, we overcame—

I’ll be there to remind you:
We never needed perfect.
We only needed each other.
And together is how our story will be told.
Together is how it was always meant to be heard.

Because together, you and I have the moments.
We have the words.
We have the lifetimes.
And best of all?

We have each other.

Before you, I had nothing.
After you, I had everything.
My story begins with you.

Do you remember the first thing I ever said to you?
How young and foolish I was back then…

(Don’t you dare tell them I’ve hardly changed.)

I barged in like a storm.
No hello. No softness. Just “Who are you?”
And still—you stayed.
Still—you saw me.

Even then…
I think some part of me already belonged to you.

Even before we shared the first glance,
there was something different about the way you made me feel.
And it’s a feeling I could never forget.
Because even now—after all this time—
you still make me feel it.

The first time I saw you only confirmed what we both already knew.
Something ancient.
Something written long before we had names to call each other.

A knowing that settled deep into my bones
the moment your eyes found mine.

I didn’t just recognize you.
I remembered you.

Even then, I think we understood:
This wasn’t a meeting.
It was a return.
Two souls, finally circling back
after lifetimes of echoing footsteps and almosts.

And my love...
you didn’t complete me.
You didn’t fix or rescue or remake me.
You reminded me.

Reminded me of who I was
when I wasn’t afraid to be seen.
When I wasn’t pretending I needed less than everything.

And you gave it to me—everything.
Not all at once,
but piece by piece.
Morning by morning.
Ritual by ritual.
Softness by sacred softness.

I never needed you to prove you were whole—
because I wasn’t either.
Not until you.

I think about that time you rolled over,
head propped on your elbow,
asking me questions you already knew the answers to...
and I couldn’t help but smile.

When I pulled you closer,
buried my face in the crook of your neck,
your arms tightened around me.
Do you remember how I left a trail of kisses along your neck,
all the way to your ear?

How when I whispered,
""Told you so, didn’t I?""
—your whole body reacted—
and in the best way?

I giggled wildly as we became a tangle of limbs and sheets.
I lived for those nights when you’d find me under our covers,
and I’d get lost in you.

I remember the first time I “serenaded” you—
how your eyebrows shot straight up,
and your face said “This woman is insane”
but oh, how we laughed.

Your laugh…
God, your laugh was magic.
And when I heard it,
my eyes filled with tears
because I knew—
I would do anything to hear that sound again.

You noticed.
Of course you did.

You crossed the distance in record time,
concern etched across your face,
your hands brushing away the tears.

You never ran from them.
Never flinched at my feelings.
You embraced them.
You embraced me.

After a lifetime of people backing away from how deeply I felt—
you stayed.
You loved me harder for it.

The small things—
our little day-to-day rituals—
they were my lifeline.

The silent conversations when our eyes would meet,
saying everything we couldn’t say out loud in those moments.
The busy mornings, quick kisses,
coffee mugs passed like batons in a track race.
The turning back for “just one more” kiss—
lips pressed to lips, whispering,
“I love you.”

It was everything.
You were everything.

And you were mine.
Always mine.

And now that we’re old—
now that time has marked our skin with the evidence of our journey,
looming overhead and reminding us our time is finite—

When that day comes…
I will have to go first.
Because there is no version of me that matters without you.
Because my story began with you.
And you are how my story ends.

It's funny how you can just sit there and let the world pass by, right? Well, as I sat there, sipping on my coffee, a thought struck me. 

I was watching this little kid chase after his runaway balloon when this older man, who I'd seen every other morning jogging past, caught it and handed it back with a big smile. The kid's mom looked relieved, and there was this brief, silent exchange that was so... I dunno, heartfelt? It got me thinking about how intertwined our actions are, even in tiny ways. 

Every action we take, even if it's just holding a door open or giving a smile, kinda loops into this bigger web of human connection that we're all part of. It's like, we affect each other all the time, even if we're not totally aware of it. 

Idk if I'm making sense, but it sorta made me appreciate those little interactions more. It’s like realizing every small ripple has a part in the larger story around us. Tbh, it made my coffee taste a tiny bit better afterwards. 😊",3,1747743389.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

I 23M, and my partner 21F have been in a relationship for a few years. She's expected to start working in Manchester this July thanks to her hard work and dedication. This is a huge achievement, and I'm incredibly proud of her—it's something we've both been working towards for a long time.

However, she's from a poor country, and the opportunity to work in Manchester is highly competitive—especially among her more experienced colleagues. So when she earned this position after only a few months, it created a lot of resentment. As a result, she's made several enemies.

Three departments have been bullying her, and their actions have become increasingly dangerous. They've spiked her drink, stolen her wallet multiple times, spilled hot coffee on her, broken into her hotel room, and most recently, damaged a valuable item and blamed her for it. As the deadline gets closer, their behavior is becoming more extreme. I’m really worried, but she’s strong, and she’s determined not to let this stop her from taking the job in Manchester and starting our life together.

They broke the jar (the valuable item) and then had the CCTV footage removed thanks to their connections. This is serious—if she didn’t pay for the damage immediately, the company could have taken legal action, which might have jeopardized her main job offer. That’s what they want. We paid it off, but I had to use a significant portion of my credit card. Ofc they pushed to take legal action but we managed to sort it.

Rent in the city is too expensive, but fortunately, her company allowed her to work from home, although she still needs to go in at least two weeks a month.

I've been helping her out financially since Christmas, but lately, I’ve been sending even more, and it’s starting to take a toll on me. I don’t need the money as urgently since I live with my parents, but she could end up homeless or without food, so I’m doing what I can.

I’m just not sure what to do. We’re so close—just a month and a half away from starting our life together properly. My current plan is to keep using my credit card, as long as I can pay it off before interest hits. In July or May, we should both be able to pay it down together as she will start her job, good pay, and I will have a lot leftover since Im not supporting her.

And yes, I trust her. We FaceTime constantly, send lots of videos, and we've both done plenty to prove our loyalty and commitment to each other.

Any advice for either us will help. Or maybe you have gone through something similar and its paid of ten folds. Thank you",1,1747743368.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Any suggestions 30 minutes or less for shows new ot old would be welcome.   Ideally with lige like dialogue rather than theatrical.   Actual writing quality does not need to high, the barcis low :-) . Bonus if it's good.

Ideally netflix but can  consider other streaming platforms and might go all in and subscribe yo TVB
