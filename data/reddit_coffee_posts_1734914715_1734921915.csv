1hke73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hke73n/aita_for_defendidng_my_fiance_from_his_mother/,AITA for defendidng my fiance from his mother?,"Hi, my name is Kate and I'm 30 years old. My fiance (30) has a mother who is becoming more and more unbearable. I want to ask the reddit users if I'm so terrible for defending myself and my partner. The situation is like this. (T apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language.)  
Before Christmas (about a month before), we called his mother to see if she wanted to come with her husband for Christmas. His mother is 60 years old this year. That's when they told us they couldn't, that they had arranged with her ex-husband to visit him. Yes, I know how strange it sounds. She and her husband are best friends with her ex-husband. After a week, we called them again to see if they wanted to come at least for coffee in the afternoon. Especially since her ex-husband lives two doors down in the block of flats next to us.

Last week, she and us called again that we were going on a trip to see my family there on Saturday morning and back on Sunday early evening. The conversation on the phone was exceptionally pleasant and we ended it saying that after Christmas we would visit her and give her birthday presents or go to her ex-husband home and wish her a happy birthday there. After an hour from the end of the call, her husband texted my fiance something like this: How can you allow yourself to treat your mother like this? You're crazy, you treat her terribly and she's supposed to be 60. We're not at home for you, so don't call us and don't visit us.

My fiance wanted to reply to this message to her husband, but before he could, my mother's husband blocked him on Facebook from where he wrote to him. We immediately called him and wanted to ask what was going on. Instead, he picked it up and immediately put it down. We let the situation calm down, I thought it would calm down like all these manipulative episodes of hers. Instead, a few days later, she wrote this in short: I don't want any handouts and a loving play. We live twenty minutes from you, but you don't come, and if you do, you rush back home and only stay for a while. And that you need to rest after work? I won't be here forever and you act like this. You are a snob and behave terribly. You said yourself that you have a new family. So don't bother.

To put things in perspective. I am a teacher and my partner works 12 hour shifts at work. My fiance's mother still complains that we don't visit her enough. We visit my family 4 times a year, always for 2 to 3 days. There is no other way because of work. We go to his mother's house at least once a month, and during the summer break this year we visited their garden at least 6 times. His mother has health problems with her spine and is at risk of two surgeries. She was on drips and taking many medications. I understand that she is worried about her health, but she is exaggerating. Every time we want to come to them, she starts making excuses for not coming. For example: Don't drive Kate works in education. (Children have germs.) Don't go, we're not well. Don't go, you were on a trip in a bigger city and you will bring covid home to us. Etc.

On the other hand, she constantly blames us for not going to see them, when they themselves prevent us from doing so, and when we invite them, they don't come even though they are two doors away. We didn't do anything to them and yet we are always the bad ones. Even after we both celebrated our thirtieth birthdays this year. My fiance had a party planned that got canceled three times because of them. First because they were sick, second because mother's husband went to work abroad (they had debts and needed money) and third because they couldn't make it that weekend. Eventually we gave up and stopped asking. On my birthday they were invited to my family for a family celebration of my thirtieth birthday. A few days before leaving, they called us that mother's husband had health problems and they could not go with us. It even pissed me off and I'm a pretty calm person. They were supposed to go on vacation a week later. The day before leaving for my family, we went to their garden and asked them how they were doing and so on. We were told that on Friday (the day of my our travel) they would bring pebbles between the flower beds and that she and her husband would somehow transfer it to the flower beds. And again we were the bad ones for not helping them because we were going away. In the end, their vacation didn't work out because their dog got sick. (My fiance sad me that it was carma. :D)Ever since I met his mother, her health has gradually deteriorated and even her doctor has prescribed medication to calm her mental state. (She didnt take it.) She hasn't had an easy life, I understand that, but she can't treat us like this and expect us to shut up and not fight back.

Today, despite their warning (we are not at home for you), we went to wish her a happy birthday. We wrote to her that we were waiting in the parking lot and if we could come. We were actually standing below the house and waiting for what she would write. We heard the text ringing on her cell phone through the open window. They were at home, there was a light. We heard them talking about it upstairs, and after about 5 minutes, a text message written by her husband arrived saying they were not at home. (We recognized it because it was written in his language. He is from a different country than us.) We collected about $130 worth of gifts and went home. My fiancé couldn't stand it at home and wrote to her husband that he was writing to his mom and not to him and why is he still answering messages for her. And then he blocked his number to repay him for blocking him on Facebook. We went to see a netflix movie and that's when I started getting messages on my cell phone.

She wrote to me how can we afford to treat her husband like this and who wrote the SMS. That now they are arguing at home about it and that she wasn't home. She said she was at the pharmacy for her medication and he wrote the message for her. That she is not well, etc. Instead, I looked at her stories on Facebook, how she is smiling with a cake, taking pictures of a flower and a gift from him and looking very well and not sick as she constantly writes to us. During our relationship with them, we found out that his mother lies very often and chooses when she has time and when she doesn't want to go or do anything. We figured it about her due to the fact that when she was with my fiance's brother and his girlfriend she was gossiping about us and when she was with us she was gossiping about them She just didn't understand that we were having fun together and we would tell each other everything. She slandered her brother's girlfriend that she was a gold digger and that her son was under her influence. On the other hand, his mother claimed that I made up my nut allergies. (I choke and throw up after eating nuts and have other food allergies.) That I don't clean and my house is a mess and the worst part is that I'm fat. After my knee injury I gained 20 kilos and unfortunately I am not that lucky to lose it even if I try.

After I defended myself for the first time and shoved it in her face very politely that even if we try, we are still the bad ones and that we want to visit them but they always discourage us, she was silent for a while and then started again. No confession I did this and that. Instead, the same again, who wrote the message and how can we insult her husband like this. At the same time, he was the first to write us and threaten us not to go to them. Subsequently, I objected that half of the things she says are not even true, that they have changed and not us, and I have no idea what happened. And that if she wants something to my fiancé, she should write to me, because she is hurting him and I will not allow her to treat him like this. Subsequently, about an hour later, she wrote to my fiance this: Since you have been with Kate, you have changed and you are acting rudely to them. I hope you are not unreasonable and you can have comunicate with me as much as you want.

When threats didn't work, she tried questions, and when those didn't work either, she tried to destroy or disrupt our relationship. So what do you guys think. Am I really that terrible for standing up to this callous and toxic mother?

He gets into slumps like this, where it's hard for him to make himself do even the bare minimum.  That's part of why i've been inviting him to do little things.  Go out to get snacks, come over to mine for a game, go to his favorite coffee shop, stuff like that.  But he always cancels by texting either an hour before we meet or 6 hours after.  He always apologizes for not making it, but it's just bumming me out so much.  I want to help and support him, but I can only do so much before I'm enabling, i feel like.

I counted my calories again and lost the weight, then I had mouth surgery (wisdom teeth removal) and lost weight tremendously bc I was addicted to the numbers going down (liquid diet) before then I gained 5 pounds bc it was mostly from muscle gain (I was very fit, at the time I cut my hair short to celebrate how strong I was) but I got scared of the numbers dropping too fast (I was at a normal healthy weight) so I let myself eat a burger… I became protein obsessed.. ate way too much beef.. I gained it all back and am officially obese.. I wasn’t allowed to go outside alone (I used to walk up hills for two hours a day and lift weights before the incident). Reason I can’t go outside alone anymore is: I have a drunk, MJ addicted neighbor (thankfully he moved out a year ago) the husband was harassing me by puffing in my face whenever I went out to throw out the trash) my bf, understandably pissed off, he talked smack to him calling out his wife calling her trash and a whore (which she was bc all her children are from someone else and it’s her fault trust me I’m not being mean everyone knows her story).

1hke31m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1hke31m/my_ufeuae_experience/,My UFE/UAE Experience,"I am 4 days post the UFE procedure and will share my experience so far. I will come back and update this post in 3 months after my follow-up MRI and doctors visit.

I had the UFE and a post-procedure nerve blocked performed.

Background: I'm a 31 y/o woman, never had kids, with 10+ subserosal / submucosal fibroids with the largest sitting on top of my uterus at 10cm+. Heavy periods that have gotten as long as 8-10 days.

Night Before Prep: I was told to not eat or drink (not even water) past midnight the night before the procedure. I shaved ""down there"" else they will do it for you if they are accessing through the groin. If your doctor is going to do radial (wrist) access don't worry about this but keep in mind nurses will still see you down there because they will place a foley catheter. I was told to not wear any jewelry but I took it with me for my mom to put on me afterwards because I hate being without it.

In-Hospital Pre-Procedure Prep: Arrived to the hospital 2 hours before the procedure time for prep. They told me to expect to stay overnight (I didn't - more about that later). My mom was with me and they let her come back to the overnight room with me. 

They did the following in the room that I was told I would be staying in overnight:

* Drew my blood. Since I hadn't eaten, I nearly passed out needed to lay down.
* Had me change into a hospital gown and put socks and a warm blanket on me.
* Placed a foley catheter. I tried to refuse this but they said it was necessary. 
* Placed an IV. Nearly passed out again. 
* Placed a anti-nausea patch behind my ear (more on this below)
* Took my blood pressure.

Procedure: 

* They rolled me in the bed I was already laying in in the overnight room to the OR. They had me scooch onto the operating table and strapped me in and put a warm blanket on me. They made me so comfortable. 
* The attending doctor, the fellow (5th year student), a nurse and two techs were in the OR.
* The attending doctor spoke to me before they sedated me and they did a safety time out. They should read off your name, birthdate and the procedure to be performed. If anything doesn't sound right, speak up.
* They told me they were going to sedate me and injected through the already placed IV port. I immediately felt relaxed.
* My memory went in and out after this. I felt no pain until the very end (next bullet) I do not remember them making the incision. I do remember speaking to the fellow doctor as he was performing the procedure. I remember also speaking to the attending doctor and asking him if the fibroids had started feeding off my ovaries (something I was afraid of since I had a bigger fibroid) and he said they had not.
* After the procedure was done (1.5 hours) I remember a third doctor walking up to me and introducing himself as the doctor that would perform my nerve block. As was told to me, the past 150ish procedures they have been doing this nerve block so that you are completely numb to any pain in my abdomen for about 6-8 hours after the procedure. They use a needle and inject some medicine below your belly button. I remember this hurting and me crying, but it was quick and then I felt no pain.

Post-Procedure:

* I was rolled back to my room where my mom was waiting for me. I felt high and happy, must have been the drugs. My mom got me my first coffee of the day and some food. I felt so good. I was texting and calling people. I saw the messages after and didn't remember them lol.
* They put me on bed rest for 4 hours. I asked them to immediately remove the foley catheter and they did then gave me a bed pan just in case.
* They gave me a PCA pump with Dilaudid for pain but I didn't feel the need to press it. 
* The attending and fellow checked on me a few times. The attending said I looked so good that I could go home same day if I wanted to. They gave me some prescription pain meds and made sure I could pee on my own.
* I was just given medications (listed below) with no pain management plan other than the recommended doses on the bottles
* **I went home. It was a mistake.**

First Night:

* After getting home and going to bed, the cramps started coming on after the nerve block wore off. The pain was so bad. I've never had a kid but I imagine this is what labor pains are like. I was crying and sobbing. My only relief was the heating pad and I took one Percocet. Barely slept.
* Had I stayed in the hospital, I would have had the PCA pump and not had any pain.

Day 1 Post Procedure:

* I was in moderate to severe pain most of the day. I took another Percocet and alternated with 800 mg ibuprofen.
* I had the heating pad on me constantly. The cramps were in my abdomen, sides, inner thighs. Be careful because I got a mark on my skin from using the heating pad so much.
* Could not stand for more than 1 min. Went from bed to couch to toilet.
* Little to no appetite.
* Barely slept at night, woke up in a lot of pain in the middle of the night, cramps were so bad. Crying again.

Day 2 Post Procedure:

* Woke up with blurry near vision, couldn't read anything. Freaked out. Turns out I had touched the anti-nausea patch and then touched my eyes. Don't do that. It resolved on its own a day later.
* **EXCRUCIATING PAIN**: This is when the pain got BAD about midday. I got to the point where I was gonna lose my mind if I wasn't given more pain medication. I felt like an addict. Finally got on the phone with the doctor and he said I could take 2 Percocet and 2 Toradol and then 1 - 2 Percocet and 1 Toradol every 6 hours. I immediately felt stable and could lay down comfortably.
* Pain woke me up again at night but it was not as bad. 

Day 3 Post Procedure:

* Woke up with cramps but pain started to decrease. I was worried because I was running out of Percocet, but I started alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Toradal 10mg every 3 hours and that worked well. 
* Pain was on and off all day.
* Couldn't stand much. Felt very tired. Appetite was starting to come back.
* Slept ok but pain woke me up at 6 am. Was not as intense as previous nights but it was bad enough to make me doubt if I was gonna ever start feeling better.

Day 4 Post Procedure:

* Continued alternating the Tylenol and Toradol every 3 hours. Worked so well. 
* Finally got my appetite back and ate a proper meal. 
* First shower in 5 days. Detangled my hair with a spray bottle and spray conditioner while sitting on my bed and then sat on a chair in the shower as a precaution in case I got light headed. Made sure someone was in the house before taking a shower. 
* **Spontaneously, the pain subsided**. I was in a good mood again. I could walk. I even felt like cooking so I did. I was feeling so good and couldn't believe my pain was gone.

Medications Prescribed:

* Percocet 5-325 mg (lowest dose)
* Toradol 10 mg
* Zofran for nausea
* Ibuprofen 800mg
* Acetaminophen 325mg

**Summary**: Assuming the procedure was successful, I don't regret it. If I were to do it again, I would definitely stay the night in the hospital and make the doctor give me a pain management plan before leaving. I would also not leave without the doctors cell phone number (it was very hard to get a hold of him when I was dying of pain). Make sure there is someone who can be with you post recovery. Plan on not leaving the house for 5 days at least. 

I will post an update in 3 months after my followup visit!

**TL;DR**: I am 4 days post UFE procedure, procedure was painless, I was given a nerve block post procedure. I should have stayed the night so that I could have access to a PCA pump for pain once the nerve block wore off but I went home and it was a mistake. The first 3 days were excruciatingly painful with cramps and I had barely any appetite and slept very little. Make sure your doctor gives you an adequate pain management plan before you go home. Day 4 and I feel almost no pain and was able to walk around the house and cook today.",2,1734921188.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False

I’m going through a bit of a rough patch and just wanted to get this off my chest. It’s been one thing after another lately - caught a bad cold few weeks back, had my money stolen, and then just yesterday, the girl I was dating broke up with me 💔 It’s been... rough, to say the least.

I know the holiday season is supposed to be cheerful and uplifting, but honestly, all the festivities around me are making it harder to deal with everything. I’m feeling pretty low right now, and I guess I’m just looking for a bit of connection.

I’d appreciate it if there’s any kind-hearted soul out there - maybe even a girl looking to meet a decent, simple guy - to share a walk 🎑, a cup of coffee ☕, or a few good songs 🎧 with. Even just hanging out till the end of the year would make things feel a little less heavy. Oh, I'm a software eng at Tesco Farringdon.

1hke0vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hke0vk/cutting_ties_with_toxic_parents_and_facing/,Cutting ties with toxic parents and facing loneliness,"Sorry it's long - there is a lot of history and context. The TLDR is at the bottom.

I've (25F) always had a volatile relationship with my parents. Though they are both in the picture, they were - and still are - completely emotionally absent. My mother is mentally ill and emotionally abusive. My siblings and I speculate she has borderline personality disorder and religious OCD. My father is her enabler, and does so mainly to protect himself. He will agree with me in secret about my concerns regarding her mental and physical health, then will crucify me in front of her by taking her side when her behavior poses concerns and issues, so that he doesn't experience her wrath.

Throughout my childhood they were there for me financially, but made me feel guilty about them financially supporting me. In terms of my health, they resented that I had to go to therapy and hated the copay. I was in therapy because I had to process being bullied and sexually assaulted by students at my middle and high school. They also financially abused me by controlling my finances and withholding support when I needed it. For example, my mom wouldn't let me get a job to pay for groceries and other essentials during undergrad, but also would complain when I would ask for money for food. She locked herself in her bedroom for days when I expressed wanting to get a part-time job. This was because she believed service jobs were ""beneath me,"" but refused to help me with essentials when I took on unpaid internships to avoid conflict. The best part is my parents were not financially struggling and lived INCREDIBLY comfortably.

In addition, my parents also tried to gaslight me into believing I was lazy and that my therapist was wrong when, in reality, I had a learning disability. I knew something was ""wrong"" with me and immediately got a job and a separate insurance plan after graduating from college to get diagnosed. Lo and behold, I had a severe learning disability - shocker. After getting diagnosed and telling my parents, my mom chose to get diagnosed too because she thought it was ""quirky,"" and has since made the disability a personality trait. I could have gone to better schools, be academically challenged in the right way, gotten better professional opportunities, and felt more confident. Instead, I am enrolled at a law school that is not the correct fit for me, and I am not proud of it. I had LSAT scores above the 90th percentile, but my college GPA was low because I didn't have accommodations for my disability. I was waitlisted anywhere that would have given me better opportunities in my dream career, and it kills me. I attend class each day feeling out of place. I am not proud of anything academic that I accomplished, because I know I am not being challenged to think above what I am already capable of. This is not the best I could do. They weaponize the responsibilities a person takes on when they choose to have children. The worst part is I know that my parents chose to have me. Perhaps if I were an accident I would feel more sympathetic to them, but they deliberately had me and my siblings.

The turning point for me was when my mother said I made her bedridden and chronically sick, because she wanted to ""spy on me"" to make sure I didn't kill myself as a teenager. I know that my childhood was not easy, but I did not choose to be bullied or sexually assaulted. Furthermore, her statement is a flat out lie, because she could not be spying on me since she was watching tv in bed or trapped in the bathroom dealing with her symptoms. I was floored. She told me this right before my 25th birthday after I expressed to her that I was concerned about her physical and mental health. My father who had agreed with me in private, sacrificed me publicly because he didn't want to be ignored for weeks. Apparently, she will ignore him for weeks when she is mad at him. It breaks my heart, but he refuses to stand up to her when provided the opportunity, so I cannot feel sad for him.

I came back for the holiday season. I was not even home for more than two hours before the first massive fight happened. My mom became angry, because I made a joke about certain conspiracy theorists. She apparently believes in the conspiracy and took offense - I didn't know she believed it (super concerning but there's nothing my siblings and I could do, she doesn't listen to us). I apologized and respectfully moved myself from the situation and went to my room avoid further conflict. My mom only tried to apologize after I left, because my siblings called her out on her behavior (didn't get through to her about the conspiracy though). My dad agreed with her (cuz he's weak) and bashed me out loud in the kitchen with my mom. He proceeded to call me ""sad"" and told me I was ""overreacting"" via text for the rest of the night, even though I apologized (for doing nothing wrong) and made it clear I was attempting to avoid more conflict.

This interaction with the both of them solidified my decision to distance myself and ultimately estrange myself. They won't change. I've tried adapting to them, and I hate myself when I adapt because it means enabling unhealthy behavior. I either watch my mom's mental and physical health decline while my dad complains in private and changes his tone in front of her, or I take a step back and preserve my peace.

If I estrange them, I will truly have no one to fall back on. My grandparents, who supported my dreams of law school more than my parents did, would not understand due to cultural norms. I cannot rely on my friends for the emotional support a parent should provide. My only solace is in G (26M), a man with whom I was in a ""situationship."" I feel pathetic for deeply believing G is the love of my life. I’ve never felt this way about anyone—not even my long-term ex of five years, with whom I stayed because our relationship mirrored my parents' dynamics (I didn't know better). G rejected me when we dated briefly just under two years ago, but he still reaches back out to me on occasion. We kept our catch ups to friendly coffees. I entered a short lived relationship in vain to forget him. G and I didn't talk while I was in the relationship, when I mentioned it he stopped reaching out. He reached back out on my birthday over the summer. We had a few friendly coffees. In October, I slept with him for the first time since he ended things. It was so passionate and bewitching - our bodies understand each other in ways words cannot describe. Our conversations are seamless and we have significant emotional compatibility too. There is so much natural chemistry, I don't understand why he ended things abruptly but kept reaching out. I've been seeing G about once per month since October, because he was traveling and the holidays, and I look forward to every time I get to see him. We recently began watching a show together, and I am over the moon. It makes me feel so special even though he probably doesn't feel the same way about it. My own parents won't sit down to watch a show with me. I feel so lonely that simply watching a show with a man I love—who likely sees me as nothing more than an object—makes me cry tears of happiness when I think about holding his hand and cuddling.

It's not like my parents ever emotionally supported me in the first place, nothing would really change once they are cut out. But, it is nice to pretend they cared for me as real parents would and that I wouldn't be so desperately alone without them. I am trying to correct my path, but it seems so bleak.

**TLDR:** I (25F) have a rocky relationship with my emotionally absent and abusive parents. Despite financial support during childhood, my parents neglected my emotional needs, dismissed my struggles, and gaslit me about my learning disability, which affected my academic and career opportunities. My attempts to confront their behavior have been met with manipulation. I am facing loneliness and find solace in an unbalanced situationship with a man (26M), whom I believe to be the love of my life, who also previously rejected me. I am trying to correct my path, but it seems so bleak.",1,1734920984.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I went to target to get two items. After I checked out I remembered that I had some money on my starbucks card, I waited in line, ordered, then waited for my drink. I ordered a grande, blonde vanilla latte with oak milk. 

After I ordered, I saw there were four drinks ahead of my order. Those four drinks were made and the people got their order. So my order should be next. No, it was not. The five orders placed after my order were all made and those people got their drinks, there were eight drinks between the five orders. I’d been waiting there for fifteen mins now, and twelve drinks had been made. 

 (About five minutes waiting for my drink, I started getting nauseous and very unwell feeling. I realize now afterward that it was sensory overload: colognes, perfumes, excessive noise. It was so overwhelming that I couldn’t move, so I wasn’t able to put my ear plugs in)

The barista started making a thirteenth drink and then the barista who originally took my order got back from their break. When the barista saw the other barista get back from break, they immediately started making my drink. 

When they finished making my drink, they slid the drink away from their work area and started cleaning the counters. The other barista stared at them for a moment and then immediately called my name out to pick up my order. After I picked up my order, the barista stopped cleaning and returned to making drinks. The barista who had been on their break seemed to be genuinely confused at why I had just gotten my order. 

I’m so confused why this happens to me so often. I had my order placed quickly after it was my turn, I practiced my order silently to myself and knew what I was getting, I knew how much it was going to cost and was prepared to pay immediately after ordering. I was kind and spoke clearly to the barista when placing my order, I didn’t stand too close to anyone in line, I waited my turn without any complaints, and I was still somewhat punished for some reason. I get so much anxiety when I’m overlooked that I can’t speak for myself, I just go nonverbal and freeze. 

After I left I was gaslighting myself into believing they’d run out of supplies or something else. That was completely false, more than half of the orders requested oat milk and they’d plenty in their fridges. The cups were stocked, they didn’t have to wait on coffee, espresso, all ingredients were stocked and available. ",2,1734920941.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I work 9 to 6 and sometimes 7 to 7 since one of my jobs requires completing a quota. 

My hobbies are video games on PS (I prefer couch co-op since I don't play online unless on PC if there's games I'm interested in) reading books, coloring books/some kid-ish stuff, decorating, anime, practicing playing guitar and learning Japanese (and Korean) since I'm tired of waiting for fan translations of psp games.

- I don't have or want kids/pets. I've dealt with both and I'm terrible with both 😨 I'm also scared of dogs but I'm slightly less afraid of small animals

- I'm heteroromantic asexual so that means I'm not down to bang. Since I've always been this way and it's not something that can be changed I don't date because I don't want to waste anyone's time

For the last year, I've had elevated liver enzymes. They're not so high I'm being referred to anyone to address them. 

My provider told me that energy drinks can cause this. She told me after taking pre-workout for a month, she saw her own liver enzymes become elevated. Is this right? 

I drink one energy drink a day. On rare occasions I'll have a second one or a coffee in the afternoons. Three or four days a week, I take a pre-workout. I'll still have the energy drink for those days. 

I'm curious if this is a reasonable cause. It's a VA provider, and I'm not very confident in her. I don't feel like I'm abusing either substance. 

This post is to satisfy my curiosity until I can schedule an appointment with a dietitian. Along with elevated liver enzymes, my A1C is trending up, so I want to get a handle on my diet before it gets any worse. 

I don't believe there are any other reasons for my liver to be elevated. I drink alcohol monthly or less, never more than two drinks in a sitting. I didn't have any alcohol in the days leading up to any of the three blood tests that have flagged high liver enzymes.

1hkduul,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1hkduul/boss_stealing_wages/,boss stealing wages,"Hi Legal Reddit,

I started working at a Chinese owned coffee shop in Philly a little over a month ago, and I can safely say my boss has no idea what the labor laws are. When I first started working there, they had a “policy” where they take $20 from your paycheck if you are 15 minutes late and $50 from your paycheck if you are over 30 minutes late (we only get $8 an hour to begin with). They have done this to their Chinese-American employees many, many times, and they stole almost $400 from my roommate for late fees. I feel really bad because the Chinese international college students that work there likely do not know their labor rights. I have a working proficiency in Chinese, so I explained to them that this is illegal, and the boss repaid my roommate her stolen wages, but she has likely not done this for the other workers. 

I thought everything would be fine after that, but I got my paycheck for 94 hours and was not paid overtime for the 14 hours over 80. I asked my boss about it and said to her that if she can’t pay me and her other current employees backpay for the overtime wages we are due, I will quit by Feb 1st. She called me in a panic saying that she can’t afford to pay us overtime, and if we don’t want to work more than 40 hours we don’t have to. She said employees work overtime because they can’t afford their living expenses on just 40 hours, so she allows them to work more than that. I explained to her that that is fine, but she is legally required to pay 1.5x the base pay for anything over 40 hours a week. She said she can’t afford to do this. 

To my understanding, it’s not about whether the overtime hours are voluntary or mandatory, they still have to be paid time and a half. She will likely not be paying me or anyone else overtime. Also, I am concerned for the labor rights of my coworkers because they only get paid via Venmo and do not receive paystubs, so they can’t report the wage theft if they wanted to. What should I do? Should I report this to the Philadelphia department of labor?  Would I need a lawyer?

Thank you for your help, and I can provide the “employee handbook” if needed. (It’s really just a random document that their one employee/manager/college student typed up.) 

EDIT: I feel the worst for the woman who makes the sandwiches at the shop. She works every single day from 7 AM - 4 PM, and I know for a fact she isn’t getting overtime pay for hours over 40/week. I tried to talk with her earlier today and tell her I don’t think the boss pays her enough, but she refused and said $8/hour is good, and it’s hard to find a job for her. She is being taken advantage of the most. If anything comes out of this, I want the boss to have to pay her more. ",4,1734920401.0,legal,4,1.0,False

You can order food to-go or dine in. The market has gift items, toys, trinkets, books, and the works. It gives me the vibes of a kichy tourist store for sure. But it's kind of buried in the Scottsdale/Biltmore/Central region, which is not exactly an easy drive-by for visitors. It's the kind of place you go to if you've heard of it or know what it is. It's pretty unassuming by the exterior, I wouldn't stop by to check it out just driving by. I found this place when I was deep dive searching for different pizzerias in the valley. The pizzas are really good. Greasy as all get out, like where you might wanna dab a napkin on it beforehand. And if you don't let it set just a bit, the weight of the toppings will laugh at the thin crust. My friend says the best way to judge a pizzeria is by its cheese pizza. At $17, La Grande's cheese pizza is good, not great. The rest of their pizzas, loaded with a good spread of toppings (they don't skimp with the toppings, we love to see it) are priced around $19. I'm not sure why a simple base model cheese pizza would be only $2 cheaper than the rest of the artisan pizzas. For like $12, it would be a great cheese pizza. At $17, it's a cheese pizza. I had a seasonal pizza with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, another thing or two, and I added fennel sausage. I don't remember everything that was on it but that pizza alone made the entire bill and trip worth it. I felt how Ratatouille must've felt eating the cheese and strawberry together. The flavors sang in my mouth and the world faded away. It was actually that good. From the bakery side, the gelato was good and the red velvet cake was phenomenal. Expensive, but worth a trip.

Holy Cow, this place. So many things to say about this place. First of all, the parking is abysmal. Definitely recommend parking in the front part of the lot or a neighboring lot. If you try and park behind the building everything gets real tight and you'll ask yourself if this is actually a parking spot or not. Awesome, you found decent parking and walked up to the building. Good luck getting inside. For the life of me, I could not find the front door. Maybe I couldn't decipher the door because it was dark and during the day it's easier to find? The front of the building is covered in vines and leaves and such. The door is also covered in vines and leaves. If you look hard enough, you'll find the door handle sticking out. The space inside is relatively small. The area in the above photo, there's a bar top area with a couple of tables to the right of this photo on the other side of a wall, and there's some seating outside. We were greeted by Daniel who informed us it would be an hour and 45 minute wait. It's a popular place, we had suspected there would be a wait. Daniel took our name down and I asked if he wanted my number to call me when it was ready. To which he informed me that they don't call patrons when a table opens up. He recommended that most guests wait at the bar next door. When a table opens up, they walkie-talkie over to the bartenders, then the bartender will call your name out and let you know a table is ready. I was flabbergasted. What an interesting concept. Not bad by any means, quite genius if you ask me.  You can't just get onto the waiting list and then disappear. Glai partners with their neighbor to create a unique specialized user experience. They communicate with the bartenders via walkie-talkie? Are you kidding me? That's so sick. We ended up going somewhere else and when we got back, we went in to see if our table was ready. Daniel immediately recognized us and we got sat. Our waiter, Will, was fabulous. Their menu is very small, great to alleviate that decision paralysis. I asked Will if he could surprise me with a dish that didn't have dairy or spice in it. He brought out Pad kee mao, a noodle dish with fried pork belly that was delicious. It did have a chili in it, but I just pulled it out. My friend got Panang curry, a chunk of braised beef with a side of rice. We also got the mango sticky rice. The rice was pretty much the consistency of oatmeal but tasted like rice. It was rice and a slice of mango in a little coconut milk. It was so good. The mango was perfectly ripe and the flavors were just fabulous. I get the hype now. The staff was all super nice, the food was banging, and the exclusivity factor made me feel fancy.

1hkdqls,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hkdqls/aita_for_defending_my_fiancé_from_his_mother/,AITA for defending my fiancé from his mother? ,"Hi, my name is Kate and I'm 30 years old. My fiance (30) has a mother who is becoming more and more unbearable. I want to ask the reddit users if I'm so terrible for defending myself and my partner. The situation is like this. (T apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language.)  
  Before Christmas (about a month before), we called his mother to see if she wanted to come with her husband for Christmas. His mother is 60 years old this year. That's when they told us they couldn't, that they had arranged with her ex-husband to visit him. Yes, I know how strange it sounds. She and her husband are best friends with her ex-husband. After a week, we called them again to see if they wanted to come at least for coffee in the afternoon. Especially since her ex-husband lives two doors down in the block of flats next to us. 

Last week, she and us called again that we were going on a trip to see my family there on Saturday morning and back on Sunday early evening. The conversation on the phone was exceptionally pleasant and we ended it saying that after Christmas we would visit her and give her birthday presents or go to her ex-husband home and wish her a happy birthday there. After an hour from the end of the call, her husband texted my fiance something like this: How can you allow yourself to treat your mother like this? You're crazy, you treat her terribly and she's supposed to be 60. We're not at home for you, so don't call us and don't visit us.

My fiance wanted to reply to this message to her husband, but before he could, my mother's husband blocked him on Facebook from where he wrote to him. We immediately called him and wanted to ask what was going on. Instead, he picked it up and immediately put it down. We let the situation calm down, I thought it would calm down like all these manipulative episodes of hers. Instead, a few days later, she wrote this in short: I don't want any handouts and a loving play. We live twenty minutes from you, but you don't come, and if you do, you rush back home and only stay for a while. And that you need to rest after work? I won't be here forever and you act like this. You are a snob and behave terribly. You said yourself that you have a new family. So don't bother. 

To put things in perspective. I am a teacher and my partner works 12 hour shifts at work. My fiance's mother still complains that we don't visit her enough. We visit my family 4 times a year, always for 2 to 3 days. There is no other way because of work. We go to his mother's house at least once a month, and during the summer break this year we visited their garden at least 6 times. His mother has health problems with her spine and is at risk of two surgeries. She was on drips and taking many medications. I understand that she is worried about her health, but she is exaggerating. Every time we want to come to them, she starts making excuses for not coming. For example: Don't drive Kate works in education. (Children have germs.) Don't go, we're not well. Don't go, you were on a trip in a bigger city and you will bring covid home to us. Etc.

On the other hand, she constantly blames us for not going to see them, when they themselves prevent us from doing so, and when we invite them, they don't come even though they are two doors away. We didn't do anything to them and yet we are always the bad ones. Even after we both celebrated our thirtieth birthdays this year. My fiance had a party planned that got canceled three times because of them. First because they were sick, second because mother's husband went to work abroad (they had debts and needed money) and third because they couldn't make it that weekend. Eventually we gave up and stopped asking. On my birthday they were invited to my family for a family celebration of my thirtieth birthday. A few days before leaving, they called us that mother's husband had health problems and they could not go with us. It even pissed me off and I'm a pretty calm person. They were supposed to go on vacation a week later. The day before leaving for my family, we went to their garden and asked them how they were doing and so on. We were told that on Friday (the day of my our travel) they would bring pebbles between the flower beds and that she and her husband would somehow transfer it to the flower beds. And again we were the bad ones for not helping them because we were going away. In the end, their vacation didn't work out because their dog got sick. (My fiance sad me that it was carma. :D)Ever since I met his mother, her health has gradually deteriorated and even her doctor has prescribed medication to calm her mental state. (She didnt take it.) She hasn't had an easy life, I understand that, but she can't treat us like this and expect us to shut up and not fight back. 

Today, despite their warning (we are not at home for you), we went to wish her a happy birthday. We wrote to her that we were waiting in the parking lot and if we could come. We were actually standing below the house and waiting for what she would write. We heard the text ringing on her cell phone through the open window. They were at home, there was a light. We heard them talking about it upstairs, and after about 5 minutes, a text message written by her husband arrived saying they were not at home. (We recognized it because it was written in his language. He is from a different country than us.) We collected about $130 worth of gifts and went home. My fiancé couldn't stand it at home and wrote to her husband that he was writing to his mom and not to him and why is he still answering messages for her. And then he blocked his number to repay him for blocking him on Facebook. We went to see a netflix movie and that's when I started getting messages on my cell phone.

She wrote to me how can we afford to treat her husband like this and who wrote the SMS. That now they are arguing at home about it and that she wasn't home. She said she was at the pharmacy for her medication and he wrote the message for her. That she is not well, etc. Instead, I looked at her stories on Facebook, how she is smiling with a cake, taking pictures of a flower and a gift from him and looking very well and not sick as she constantly writes to us. During our relationship with them, we found out that his mother lies very often and chooses when she has time and when she doesn't want to go or do anything. We figured it about her due to the fact that when she was with my fiance's brother and his girlfriend she was gossiping about us and when she was with us she was gossiping about them She just didn't understand that we were having fun together and we would tell each other everything. She slandered her brother's girlfriend that she was a gold digger and that her son was under her influence. On the other hand, his mother claimed that I made up my nut allergies. (I choke and throw up after eating nuts and have other food allergies.) That I don't clean and my house is a mess and the worst part is that I'm fat. After my knee injury I gained 20 kilos and unfortunately I am not that lucky to lose it even if I try.

After I defended myself for the first time and shoved it in her face very politely that even if we try, we are still the bad ones and that we want to visit them but they always discourage us, she was silent for a while and then started again. No confession I did this and that. Instead, the same again, who wrote the message and how can we insult her husband like this. At the same time, he was the first to write us and threaten us not to go to them. Subsequently, I objected that half of the things she says are not even true, that they have changed and not us, and I have no idea what happened. And that if she wants something to my fiancé, she should write to me, because she is hurting him and I will not allow her to treat him like this. Subsequently, about an hour later, she wrote to my fiance this: Since you have been with Kate, you have changed and you are acting rudely to them. I hope you are not unreasonable and you can have comunicate with me as much as you want. 

When threats didn't work, she tried questions, and when those didn't work either, she tried to destroy or disrupt our relationship. So what do you guys think. Am I really that terrible for standing up to this callous and toxic mother? 

Thank you for any advice and ideas on how to get out of this hell and not be a moron with your ears down.

The word *espresso* comes from the Latin *exprimo*, which in its supine form is *expressus*.

* The proper grammatical form when referring to ""from, out of coffee beans"" would be the ablative, resulting in the non-localized variant: *expresso*.
* Americans invented the suppressor, deriving it from the Latin *suppressus*. Ironically, Italians localized it as *soppressore*. It’s pronounced *suh-pressor*, not *soh-pressor*—classic Italy, those foolish *idioanos*.
* Policing the word has been ongoing for decades, with miserable failure. The issue isn’t the failure itself but the fact that no other word, aside from *GIF*, has faced this much contention.
* If I can pronounce Geoff as Jeff, then I can pronounce GIF however I want, and you, how you want. **Debating it is not only pointless but also a complete waste of time**. What do you gain from being ""right""? **Still, these trivial, non-serious arguments** are what I use to highlight the deeper undertones within society. If I tried anything deeper, the engagement would be blocked by a [cognitive impasse. ](https://andylehti.github.io/cognitive-impasse/)

All you need to convey to people is that preferring to say ""Espresso"" simply sounds better—that’s all there is to it. I genuinely have no issue calling it espresso, however, I do enjoy destroying the arrogance of ""inept regurgitators"" face-to-face, when they lack the shield of confirmation bias one normally has from behind a screen. *If you have to Google your own argument, you lost. You don't know what you're talking about. Stop regurgitating* ***what others understand****. Knowledge is not understanding. An encyclopedia would be considered a genius if it were.* 

Internal (I) and Outward (P) projectors struggle with this dynamic because they’re unable to concede an argument. They lack natural introspection. Instead, they flip the narrative, using examples like this to claim that I am the one incapable of conceding—merely a convenient projection of their own limitations.

**And don’t reprimand anyone for choosing to call it what they prefer. As someone who studies cognition, I’ve had to endure some of the most absurd resistance when trying to persuade people to reconsider their beliefs.**

Do you know how many have actually changed their minds? Barely any, even over ten years. *This espresso example was part of a much larger paper,* yet even a university staff member remained unconvinced. It’s not that you can’t teach someone stubborn anything; it’s that you can’t tell someone educated in the public school system that they’re wrong. Doing so can trigger a reaction shaped by years of subtle yet deeply ingrained psychological conditioning—a legacy stretching back over 1,400 years.

And INTJ and INFJ have a natural tendency to eventually navigate through cognitive biases. INTJ are known for their childlike sense of curiosity which causes them to stand apart.

","Hey everyone. I was a 13 year partner (160xxxx) and I came to tell everyone who is fed up with this company but to scared to leave that it gets better. 

I started working at Sbux right outta high school, back in 2008. Honestly it used to be chill. My store didn’t have ovens, refreshers weren’t out yet, coffee was still decent. I think that being so young I didn’t see the red flags when they started. My manager made me think she was my friend, but used me in every way possible. If someone called out I she would message me making it seem like I had no choice but to come in. She would yell at me in front of other baristas and costumers. One time I ran into one of our regulars outside of work and they told me i shouldn’t be treated that way by my boss, and if I wanted they would call corporate for me. Everyone that I worked with except for maybe one or two people that im still friends with were horrible. I was a hard worker and that bit me in the ass. All the slack I picked up for everyone else turned into everyone including management to expect me to do these things automatically. After 8 years I made it up to ASM. When I tell you it was the worse times of my life, it might be an understatement. As soon as I got promoted the DM that promoted me got moved to another district, and one of the managers from my district then became DM. They put me to work at his store and it was a shit show. The new manager didn’t care about call outs. I remember this one guy did 3 no call no shows in a row and he just came back to work with no consequences. When I asked the manager what happened she said he said he didn’t want to talk about it and that it was ok. Found out he had some family over and just didn’t want to come to work. I ended up working to weeks as manager in the busiest store in our market durning thanksgiving and did an excellent job. When I went back to my old store my dm sat me down and said I had to either pick to be put in a PDP or get demoted. And in his words “no one makes it out of a pdp”. Ended up getting demoted to SSV at another store in another district. Everything was ok. Worked hard to try to be a ASM again. Nothing was good enough. Workers didn’t care. It was horrible. 

Then June of 2021, I went on vacation. I had a dream that a customer threw a drink at me and that my district manager told me before you clean up after yourself make sure the customer gets their drink correctly. I woke up got my phone and texted my store manager…”I’m sorry you don’t deserve this, but I quit.”

I didn’t have another job set up all I had to wear some savings for a couple months, but I did it. I thought to myself maybe I should’ve waited until I got another job, but that only meant that I would just keep on working there forever. I hated it by that time. I know what all of you are feeling. I read all these post and it makes me so upset that so many people are going through this and that nothing seems to have changed since I left. 

If you can, leave. Leave and don’t look back. This company has gone downhill since 2009 and you can tell by how many changes in leadership there’s been. I’m now working for a company that actually values their employees. Sbux is horrible for your mental health. I promise you it gets better. You deserve better. ",7,1734918846.0,starbucks,0,0.89,False
1hkddlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1hkddlx/fun_lesbian_situationship/,Fun lesbian situationship,"My ex and I of 3 years broke up in October. And have since gone no contact which has been difficult as hell. I swore to myself that I would stay single to focus on myself, to grow and heal and all that fun stuff etc etc etc.

At the beginning of November I received a message from my friend (also a lesbian) who is apart of my friendship group (which also includes my sister). I have fancied this girl since forever, we had a drunken fling a couple of years ago (when she had only just came out) and afterwards I tried to pursue her seriously but she didn't seem interested and I got over it.

From November, since she sent me that message we have been talking non stop and she confessed to me that she has always liked me and that she was afraid of her feelings for me especially because we were friends and she's like best friends with my sister. She also said that she had been waiting three years on me while i was with my ex......This was a game changer and made me feel like I had entered an alternate reality because she is literally my dream girl and I thought that ship had sailed a long, long time ago.

We have gone on a couple of dates (3 to be exact) which consisted of A LOT of very hot intense and passionate kissing. This girl has been giving me serious butterflies and I wear my heart on my sleeve so she knows it. I'm not afraid to tell her how into her I am. I asked her to be my girlfriend on the second date. Kind of dumb looking back on it but it just slipped out of my mouth, I couldn't help myself. I've convinced myself that it's not that ""rushed"" because we've known eachother for years and also are apparently sharing the same feelings for eachother. Anyway. She said yes to being my girl.

More to the point, I last saw her a week ago now. The last time we met we had a great time together and it was all good, lots of kissing lots of hand holding, compliments and all that good stuff. However this past week I have felt a somewhat distance happening between us. She has only been texting me twice a day...morning and late at night. This is a clear shift in energy in the way we've been texting. We weren't texting 24/7 but it was a lot more than this, we were having actual conversations (like 5 at a time) now the conversation just feels so dead because the replies are like 8 hours between eachother if not over night. She says she's been so stressed at work and it's been getting to her. She is also VERY MUCH a family gal which I'm not used to as my family aren't close. But it just feels very all of a sudden, also I asked her to meet me after work for a coffee twice (which took a lot of psyching myself up to do because I hate being rejected) and she didn't get back to me about it until late, apologising that she was busy and had been doing family stuff.
It's making me crazy it just feels that it was very intense and happening quite fast to I'm now feeling like an inconvenience to her or something. I'm over thinking the whole thing and I just feel like a fool at this point. I had asked her to be my girlfriend..yet I feel so incredibly single like I dont know if shes actually taking the whole girlfriend thing seriously. 

Im coming up with all sorts of ideas in my head that there's someone else or she's actually not interested in me and was just bored and accidentally flirted with me too hard. I can't wrap my head around it. The fact that she's so close to my sister makes me feel a bit better as I don't think she would do such a dick move to me since it would make the friend group dynamics weird and she would make herself look like an asshole to our friends and my sister..... 
I know that realistically the answer is that I need to address this to her and communicate with her that I'm getting kinda mixed messages and I'm confused. It's just so hard and I don't want to come across as needy and clingy (which I kinda am tbh) Ideally also, I'd prefer not to adress this via text and wait until I see her in person. After breaking up with my ex as part of my healing journey and personal growth I really want to work on my communication and this isn't a great start...
I've figured that I have an insecure/anxious attachment style and I'm in my head about how much I'm over thinking the situation. I go between freaking out and telling myself that it's fine, that we'll go on another date, we'll be all over eachother and it'll reassure me.

If she wasn't HER and she was just a stranger I've only recently met I for one wouldn't be talking to her anyway because I had intended to stay single after my pretty shitty breakup only the other month and two I would probably just take this weird vibe going on that she's not interested in me and cut it off.. but I feel like it's different and I'm praying she's just not a massive texter and it will all be fine.

Also for reference. She is a Sagittarius if that means anything. As far as I'm aware they're very independent people, like their own space...

I'm hoping to see her after Christmas, maybe we will go on a date and I'll be able to get some more clarity about what's going on and where her heads at... 🙏 ",1,1734918803.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

She got pregnant her sophomore year and our parents made her give the baby up for adoption. We don't know who the father is and I doubt that he even knows about the first baby. 

Well, she got pregnant AGAIN after rehab. Throughout her whole pregnancy, she was doing coke, smoking weed, and vaping! Our parents were so upset and threatened rehab again on her, so she just moved out. After some time, she had the babies (they were twins) and I called her to ask how she was doing. I also wanted to talk to her about my loss of pregnancy. She said that i can come over to her place and catch up. Her apartment was FILTHY. The babies' diapers haven't been changed, they're crying and for some reason don't like me. She just ignores their cries and snorts coke on the fucking coffee table.  Then when I tell her to go and tend to her babies, she gets an attitude and goes into the room. I still hear them crying, so I go in there and I see her SMOKING WEED AROUND THE CHILDREN?! I had enough! How dare she?! I yelled at her for being so irresponsible. She attacks me, beating me up. And I fought her ass back, because momma ain't raise no bitch. She's upset and says that she hates me. I go back home covered jn bruises and my mother, twin sister, and older brother are all worried about me wondering what happened. I told them about the conditions that Elyse's kids were in. Our mother was furious, because she didn't know that Elyse had any more children and she called CPS right along with me. 

Some hours pass and I get a text from her mocking me about being pregnant and how I should be ashamed. Right after i told her that I lost my baby! I cried and went to sleep because I didn't want to deal with this anymore. I blocked her on Social Bunny and her number, so she has no way of contacting me ever again.

I remember looking at this sub years ago while trying to limit my VG consumption. Obviously I was unsuccessful in that endeavor or else I wouldn’t be posting here now. Well  I am already in my 30s & that feeling of “What the hell have I been doing all this time?” has really come crashing down on me in recent days. It is truly a terrifying sensation looking back at the past 6 years (when I really started to use video games as a coping mechanism) and seeing a blurry history of events littered with failed relationships, substance abuse & little to no new skills learned. But first I would like to go over some of the history of how this happened, where my mind was during all of it, and where I have arrived now. 

I have played video games since I was about 6 years old. Even before that I can recall an old SNES that my mom and dad bought back in the early 90s. I remember watching my dad play this weird old text based battleship game on there all the time shortly after my mom left us when I was like 3. I’m not saying that I learned this coping behavior from him early on in my life as he really didn’t get into games later, but it still is a memory that stands out to me from back then. Anyway, around the age of 6 my dad managed to save up (we were poor as hell) enough to get me a game boy color & Pokémon red for my birthday. I loved these games so so so much and honestly it made my elementary school years so much more social than they were before. I was an extremely shy and quiet kid, but after getting Red, I had all sorts of stuff to talk about with the boys on the playground. I know that there is tons of good information stating that kids getting hooked on games at a young age is unhealthy (it definitely is, especially with modern games) but this socialization was truly a godsend for  extremely timid kids like me. Shortly after that, I got Zelda Oracle of Seasons for the GBC and met my current best friend at a day camp through both of us playing those amazing games. Then it was a PS2 and I remember renting Final Fantasy 10 over and over and over again from blockbuster just to get to the end. Their discs were always scratched & I had to keep waiting for a functional to get returned to the store. Still my favorite game story of all time & I have great memories playing it with my little brother during some of our worst, most depressing times as kids which I will not get into here. 

So the PS2 was the last console I have ever really owned/played, and around the age of 15, that same best friend I met playing Zelda introduced me to World of Warcraft around the end of the Burning Crusade expansion. As many here have mentioned, that first WoW experience as a 15 year old boy is borderline cathartic. This game was so damned amazing, fun, addicting and SOCIAL. but I was playing on an old laptop and couldn’t handle AoE particle effects. Still had fun raiding at 10 fps because it was with a bunch of high school dorks like me. After getting my first job, I basically saved all of my money to build my first gaming rig as Fallout 3 had just been released around then and I HAD to play it. Looking back now 15+ years later, I kind of see this time as the first real sign of gaming addiction, although it was kept mostly at bay because I still had other hobbies I enjoyed…namely skateboarding and skateboarding in front of girls at school. This was 2007, it was the pinnacle of cool to be a skater lol. This will be too long if I go through the comprehensive history of gaming for me, but you get the idea. Games have been a part of my life for a long time. But now it is time to jump to 2012, when I was introduced to my biggest vice, Team Fortress 2



I love this game so much. To this day, my love for it still is very strong. TF2 has so much mechanical depth and one of the most unique identities in the entire industry. Also it is just a goofy game with goofy characters. The voice lines for the classes still can make me laugh today. I dropped out during my freshman year in college due to financial issues (don’t go to private university unless it is already fully paid for!!) and basically started the cycle of work > game > sleep > repeat. around the age of 19, I introduced alcohol into that routine and became a drunk on top of it. I don’t mean like 19 year old in college at a party drunk. Nope, I mean I was drinking a handle of Jim Beam whiskey that my manager at work would buy me every 3 days or so. After about 4 days of work, I would have a break of 2-3 days where I would spend nearly every moment of my day getting plastered and playing tf2. This was truly a miserable time for me. It got bad enough to where I actually moved back in with my dad and was working an absolutely brutal minimum wage job 40 hrs/week. And I was doing the same thing. I was 21 by then and was just buying cases of beer/bottles of JB and putting them in a mini fridge I bought for my room there so my dad wouldn’t have to see it. This continued for about another year and a half and is to this day, the darkest part of my life which I do not want to get into detail with on here. The end of this period was me following a girl I was in love with and dating at the time to another state. That relationship fell apart (started gaming and drinking again, big surprise!!) due to many reasons and I ended up on a work friend’s couch afterward. Little did I know, this actually freed me from all of those vices. This group of friends I ended up living with were kinda local artist types and opened my mind to many things. I sold my tower and did not play a game for the 3 years I lived there. Also during this time, I picked up playing the guitar and was taking classes & progressing quite rapidly. One of my favorite things to do back then was to sit for hours and hours noodling on my guitar over scales and drinking coffee. I was still in my early to mid 20s and life was super irresponsible (a lot of partying) but also genuinely fun and I was legitimately happy. But I eventually wanted to see other, bigger places.



I then moved again to a large city and was forced very quickly to figure out how I am going to afford the much, much higher cost of living after my roommate bailed on me out of nowhere. So I worked…a lot. At one point, I was working two jobs at around 15 hours a day, 5 or 6 days a week. Again, this was miserable. Working like this also was dangerous as I almost veered into a car on the expressway because I fell asleep at the wheel due to exhaustion. After 3 months of this and the almost car crash, I made union at my  primary job, which more than doubled my pay and quit the supplemental one. And guess what I did next! Saved up money and bought….another PC. so the cycle began again. I was getting drunk & playing video games in between working and sleeping. The guitar collected dust in my closet. 



I have been here going on 8 years now. There have been two extremely intense romantic relationships since then which didn’t fail from VG addiction, but other issues on my end, most notably being emotionally distant. What I want to say now is that gaming hasn’t destroyed my love life or career. I have a stellar record at work and am quite good at what I do (despite still being underpaid compared to the cost of living here!!) To return to the beginning of this rambling recollection, I keep looking back at these years, especially since I moved to where I am now, and thinking “is this all there is?”. even as recently as a week ago, I still was just doing the same old work, game sleep, routine. I no longer have any other real hobbies. Last year I was going to the gym nearly everyday after work but this year I have been working so many hours that it’s hard to find the energy after. It’s very difficult to muster the strength to bench press after working for 10-12 hours. 



So a couple days ago, I decided that I need to just QUIT (not moderate!!) gaming entirely. I have somewhat obsessively been going through stories on this sub and also agree that gaming is a pointless, fruitless time sink that accomplishes nothing. I want nothing to do with it. After tonight it will be 3 days since I last played. I already cancelled all gaming subscriptions and after I get back from seeing family for the holidays, I am rearranging my apartment to do other hobbies. The guitar is gonna get cleaned and restrung and I am going to get back in the gym when I am not working. I am going to sell the tower and all the peripherals, and kick this empty, soul-sucking practice into the fucking trash where it belongs. 



Sorry for anyone who actually had the patience to read this mess, but I needed to get it out there. Also thank you to this sub for helping me make the decision. Y’all are awesome.

 The greatest miracle is to be able to decide. To decide anything is different from other thing, energy from energy, or place from place. Deciding makes all those things change and make sense.

Types. All we have are types—different types of things and events.  
They happen and turn out to be around.  
And you are a medium of it all.  
You sense things and events in time and relate to them.

So what are the fundamental types of everything?

Matter, Energy, Space, Time, Information, Consciousness aka Decision!

I think we can argue and give different names or delegate extra power from one fundamental type in favor of another. But that is not the point here. What matters is that we truly have different types of “everything” around us.

Is there a dominant “type of everything,” or are they all of the same “power”? Let’s use a special framework to check it out.  

Computational dramaturgy is a study that focuses on events happening. Driven by inner narratives, the stories of our lives follow set goals and try to accomplish them.

Decision is a miracle that emphasizes the transformative power of agency:

1. Decision acts as a catalyst for change, transforming potential into reality.
2. Decision differentiates static elements (matter, energy) into dynamic processes.
3. Decision gives context and coherence, making sense of existence by linking choices to outcomes.

Inside your head, you have the most complexly organized matter with the ability to generate a fundamental type of everything: consciousness. Your brain generates consciousness that sets goals in time—personal goals—and changes every other fundamental type of everything, or uses them to change each other, to achieve the main set goal!

Whatever you are up to, you set some goal at every moment of now. To sit. To stand. To drink coffee. To become a parent or buy something. And you change the reality around your body to reach those goals! If you are lucky, creative, and persistent enough, you change more of everything around you. You achieve more goals that you set!

This knowledge makes me feel great all the time. Whatever life brings, I focus on trying my best to set good, healthy goals and achieve them.

Computational dramaturgy operates within such a system—a way of relating things to each other, like a language. It can be sign language, body language, written, or spoken language. When you learn the language of your inner narrative, you understand what your body, mind, and the world around them want and how to get it.

Using this dramaturgical language, that is based on a story creation, that lasts in time, has characters involved, that are viewed by an observer and get to the goal as a main fundamental level and type of reality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying well-hydrated is a fundamental element of health that many people overlook. You may often wonder, “How much water should I drink?” The answer can vary depending on various factors, including your age, gender, activity level, and overall health. Understanding these guidelines can significantly transform your health and wellness.

Water plays a critical role in numerous bodily functions. It helps regulate body temperature, keeps joints lubricated, protects organs, and aids in nutrient absorption. Drinking enough water ensures that your body operates efficiently, which leads to enhanced well-being.

### The Basic Water Intake Guidelines

A common recommendation suggests that adults drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, also known as the ""8x8 rule."" This totals about 2 liters or half a gallon. While this guideline is simple, individual needs can differ.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Men:** Generally, men need about 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) daily.
- **Women:** Women typically require about 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) per day.

This includes all beverages and food sources of water. Surprisingly, foods such as fruits and vegetables can provide a significant amount of our daily hydration needs. For instance, cucumbers and watermelon are over 90% water!

### Factors Impacting Your Water Needs

While there is a general guideline, it’s essential to listen to your body and consider the following factors that can impact your hydration needs:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### 1. Activity Level

If you exercise or engage in physically demanding work, you will need more fluids to replenish what you lose through sweat. Aim to drink water before, during, and after your workout.

#### 2. Climate

Hot and humid weather can increase the amount of water you lose through perspiration. In such environments, you may find that you need to drink more than the standard recommendations.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### 3. Health Conditions

Certain conditions may require you to adjust your fluid intake. For instance, if you have a fever, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, your hydration needs may increase.

### Signs You Need More Water

Listening to your body is key. Here are some signs that may indicate you're not drinking enough water:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Feeling thirsty
- Dark yellow urine
- Dry mouth or skin
- Fatigue or dizziness
- Headaches

If you experience any of these symptoms, it might be time to increase your water intake. Staying ahead of your hydration can improve your overall health and energy levels.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Water into your daily routine can become easy! Here are some practical tips:

- **Carry a reusable water bottle:** Having water on hand encourages you to drink more throughout the day.

- **Infuse your water:** If you find plain water boring, consider adding lemon, cucumber, or mint for flavor.
- **Eat water-rich foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables into your meals, as they contribute to hydration.
- **Drink before meals:** Having a glass of water before meals helps with digestion and also ensures you stay hydrated.

By paying attention to your body's signals and ensuring you meet your hydration needs, you can unlock a new level of vitality and wellness.

Make water a central part of your daily routine, and watch as it positively impacts your overall quality of life!

The Impact of Hydration on Energy Levels and Mood
-------------------------------------------------

Have you ever felt tired even after a full night’s sleep? Or found yourself struggling to concentrate during the day? One factor that plays a significant role in your energy levels and mood is hydration. Understanding how much water you should drink daily can make a profound difference in your overall health and well-being.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Water is crucial for your body, and it affects many bodily functions. Your brain alone is about 75% water, so staying properly hydrated can enhance your cognitive functions, improve focus, and elevate your mood. When you’re dehydrated, you might experience fatigue, irritability, and even difficulty thinking clearly.

### The Link Between Hydration and Energy

When you think about your energy levels, consider how hydration impacts them.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Boosts Physical Performance:** Adequate water intake helps your muscles function smoothly. This is especially important if you engage in physical activities. Dehydration can lead to muscle fatigue and decreased performance.
- **Prevents Tiredness:** Even mild dehydration can make you feel tired. This is because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygenated blood to your muscles and organs when you’re low on fluids.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps maintain your body’s temperature. Keeping cool during exercise or hot weather prevents exhaustion and helps you stay energized.

### Hydration's Role in Mood Regulation

Your mood is also significantly influenced by your water intake. Here’s how hydration can directly affect your emotional well-being:

- **Reduces Anxiety and Stress:** Studies suggest that dehydration can lead to increased cortisol levels (the stress hormone). When you keep your hydration in check, you may find yourself feeling more balanced and less anxious.
- **Enhances Cognitive Function:** Proper hydration supports brain function. This can lead to improved mood stability, focus, and productivity.
- **Combats Depression:** Some research indicates a link between hydration and depression. Drinking enough water can improve your overall mood and may play a role in managing depressive symptoms.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

Knowing how much water to drink is essential. While the common recommendation is eight 8-ounce glasses a day, you may need more or less depending on factors such as:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Your level of physical activity
- The climate where you live
- Your overall health and medical conditions

A good baseline is to aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, try to drink about 75 ounces of water each day. Adjust based on how you feel and your unique lifestyle.

### Signs You Need More Water

Pay attention to your body's cues to determine if you need to increase your water intake. Here are some signs to look out for:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Dry Mouth:** This is often the first indicator that your body is craving hydration.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired? It could be a sign of dehydration.
- **Headaches:** Frequent headaches or migraines can be linked to inadequate fluid levels.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Staying hydrated doesn’t have to be a chore. Here are some practical tips to help you drink more water throughout the day:

- **Keep a Water Bottle Handy:** Having a reusable water bottle allows you to see how much you’ve consumed and motivates you to drink more.
- **Add Flavor:** If plain water doesn’t excite you, try infusing it with fresh fruits, herbs, or citrus.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone alarms or apps to remind you to drink water regularly.

Keeping hydrated is essential for both your physical energy and emotional well-being. By paying attention to your water intake, you can transform your health and enhance your overall quality of life. Remember, hydration is not just about quenching your thirst—it's about nurturing your body and mind for optimal health.

Signs of Dehydration: How to Recognize and Respond
--------------------------------------------------

Dehydration can sneak up on you if you're not careful. Understanding how to recognize the signs is crucial for maintaining your health. When your body loses more fluids than it takes in, it can affect many aspects of your wellness. Here are some common signs that you might be dehydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Thirst:** This is the most obvious sign. If you feel thirsty, it's your body's way of telling you it needs more fluid.
- **Dark Urine:** Light yellow or pale straw colored urine indicates good hydration. Dark yellow or amber could be a sign that you need to drink more water.
- **Dry Mouth and Throat:** A dry mouth can make talking and swallowing uncomfortable. If you notice this, consider sipping some water.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or lethargic can signal that your body is not getting enough fluids.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration can lead to headaches. If you find yourself with frequent headaches, try increasing your fluid intake.
- **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:** These feelings can occur if your blood volume drops due to low fluid intake.
- **Skin Elasticity:** If you pinch the skin on the back of your hand and it takes a long time to return to normal, you might be dehydrated.

If you notice any of these symptoms, it’s important to respond quickly. Here are some effective ways to hydrate and feel better:

- **Drink Water:** Start with a glass of water. If it's warm outside or you've been exercising, consider drinking an electrolyte-rich beverage as well.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries have high water content. Adding these to your meals can help with hydration.
- **Set Reminders:** If you often forget to drink, try setting reminders on your phone or using apps dedicated to hydration.
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a water bottle with you will make it easier to sip throughout the day.
- **Monitor Your Caffeine Intake:** Drinks like coffee and tea can be dehydrating. Balance your intake with plain water.

For some, recognizing dehydration can be challenging. It's even easier during hot weather or when you're physically active. Here’s why recognizing these signs is so important:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Prevents More Serious Health Issues:** Chronic dehydration can lead to more serious conditions like kidney stones or urinary tract infections.
- **Enhances Athletic Performance:** If you're an athlete, proper hydration can improve your performance and energy levels.
- **Supports Skin Health:** Staying hydrated can improve the elasticity and appearance of your skin.
- **Improves Concentration:** Dehydration can affect your cognitive abilities. Staying hydrated helps keep your mind sharp.

For those who find it difficult to drink plain water, consider spicing it up. Infuse your water with slices of lemon, mint, or other fruits to make it more palatable. This little tip can not only make drinking more enjoyable but can also encourage you to drink more throughout the day.

Some people may have higher hydration needs, such as those in hotter climates, pregnant women, or individuals who exercise heavily. Adjusting your water intake according to your personal lifestyle is key. Be mindful of how your body feels, and don’t hesitate to drink more when needed.

Keeping an eye on the signs of dehydration can significantly impact your overall health and wellness. Don't wait until you're feeling parched or unwell. By listening to your body and responding to its needs, you can maintain good hydration and promote better health.

The Role of Water Intake in Weight Management
---------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our survival and significantly influences our overall health. Many people overlook the impact of proper hydration when it comes to managing weight. Understanding how much water you should drink can transform your health and wellness in various ways.

Firstly, drinking adequate amounts of water can help curb your appetite. Sometimes, your brain can confuse thirst with hunger. When you feel hungry, try drinking a glass of water instead. This simple action might help you avoid unnecessary snacking and keep your caloric intake in check.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
In addition, consuming water can enhance your metabolism. Several studies suggest that drinking about 500 ml (or about 17 ounces) of water can increase metabolic rate by approximately 30% for about 30-40 minutes. This means that by just drinking more water, you may be burning extra calories, which can be beneficial for weight management over time.

### Hydration and Exercise

When it comes to weight management, hydration plays a crucial role in your exercise routine. Staying hydrated ensures that your body functions optimally during workouts. Here are a few benefits of drinking water before, during, and after physical activity:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved Performance:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased performance. Drinking enough water helps maintain your energy levels.
- **Reduced Injury Risk:** Hydration helps lubricate joints and supports muscle function, minimizing the risk of injuries.
- **Enhanced Recovery:** Water aids in repairing muscle tissue and replacing lost fluids after exercise.

### Water-Rich Foods

Aside from drinking water, incorporating water-rich foods into your diet can also aid in weight management. These foods help hydrate your body and can keep you feeling full longer with fewer calories. Consider adding the following to your meals:

- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Strawberries
- Celery

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to how much water you should drink. Various factors like your age, weight, activity level, and climate can influence your hydration needs. However, a general guideline is to aim for about 8 to 10 cups (64-80 ounces) of water daily.

Another helpful strategy is to listen to your body. Pay attention to your thirst cues and urine color. If your urine is light yellow, that's a good sign of adequate hydration. If it's dark, you may need to drink more water.

Creative Ways to Increase Your Daily Water Consumption
------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for your overall health and wellness. Yet, many people struggle to drink enough water each day. If you've ever found yourself wondering how you can meet your hydration goals more creatively, there are many fun and simple strategies to boost your daily water intake.

Start your day by drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning. This habit can jumpstart your metabolism and replenish fluids lost during sleep. To make this routine more enjoyable, consider adding a slice of lemon or cucumber to your water. This little twist not only enhances the flavor but also provides additional nutrients.

One effective way to increase your hydration is to incorporate water-rich foods into your diet. Foods such as watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges have high water content, and they help you stay hydrated while also providing vital vitamins and minerals. Keep a bowl of these hydrating snacks on your kitchen counter or desk as a delightful reminder to eat healthily and hydrate.

Another creative method is to infuse your water with various fruits, herbs, and spices. You can combine lemon and mint for a refreshing taste, or try strawberries and basil for a sweeter option. The infusion process not only makes drinking water more exciting but also encourages you to consume more throughout the day.

Consider using a reusable water bottle as a daily companion. Opt for one that has time markers on it, reminding you to take sips throughout the day. Carrying a stylish, fun bottle can motivate you to drink more. Fill it with water or your favorite-infused mixture, and keep it within arm's reach. Each time you take a sip, you're reinforcing the habit of staying hydrated.

Set reminders on your phone or download a hydration tracking app. By scheduling water breaks during your day, you can ensure you're drinking enough. For instance, a reminder every hour can prompt you to drink a small glass of water. Consistency is key, and technology can help you integrate this into your daily routine.

Social hydration can also be effective. Partner with friends or family members to encourage each other to drink more water. You can set collective goals or challenge each other to log your water intake. Making hydration a fun and shared activity can motivate you to stay committed.

- **Mix Up Your Hydration Sources:** Explore various beverages to add variety to your hydration habits. Herbal teas, coconut water, and flavored sparkling water can be enjoyable alternatives. Just be cautious with intake from drinks high in sugar or caffeine.
- **Use Straw Methods:** Studies suggest that drinking through a straw can make the experience more enjoyable and encourage quicker consumption. Experiment with colorful, reusable straws that make drinking fun.
- **Create a Hydration Game:** Turn hydration into a game by challenging yourself. Consider a point system for every glass consumed throughout the day. Reward yourself at the end with something enjoyable.
- **Make It a Habit During Mealtimes:** Always drink a glass of water before or with your meals. This not only helps with hydration but can aid in digestion too.

Remember that hydration isn't just about water. Other liquids contribute to your daily intake, but be mindful of their sugar and calorie content. Clear, calorie-free beverages are typically the best choices when trying to increase your hydration.

Hydration into your daily routine comes down to creativity and consistency. By finding enjoyable ways to boost your water consumption, you empower yourself to keep your body functioning at its best. Whether it's fun bottles, infused waters, or tasty snacks, you can turn hydration into a habit that benefits your overall health and wellness.

Also compared pan frying (left) to air fryer (right) - air frier is easier and cooks more evenly, but outside can be slightly drier. Air fryer ones are also a little crisper on the outside, so sturdier.

1hkcttk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/1hkcttk/i_just_wanna_share_my_story_and_look_for_some/,I just wanna share my story and look for some advise,"I am a 30M who has been involved with a woman 12 years older than me. 
A lot of coincidences had to happen for us to meet, it was way more likely for us to never meet than to have met. We both live abroad and in different countries, she was on vacation in the country where I am currently living, and as I said, without getting into too much detail, ended up meeting thanks to one coincidence after another. I was never looking for an older woman, of course as a guy I always the fantasy of being with an older woman but never really actually pursued it or looked for it in any way.

When I first laid my eyes on her, I forgot my own name. She was (and is) the most beautiful and attractive woman I have ever seen in my whole life, and I was instantly attracted and just knew I would have hated myself if I didn’t make a move. I’ve always been a confident man and have dated beautiful women before, but when I was making my moves I couldn’t help but feeling nervous and excited at the same time. We agreed to meet, went for a coffee and had very very nice conversations; honestly speaking I never felt an age gap, and didn’t really care about it tbh. Coffee turned into a walk, then into fun activities together, then to lunch, and then to us traveling together to another city to spend together her last couple of days of vacation. I was nothing but excited and happy, we stayed in the same room (different beds) and the next day we had an amazing all-day date.

Everything happened on that day, we walked while I grabbed her by the waist, we hugged, held hands, kissed and slept together. The next day I went with her to the airport, we said goodbye and honestly I thought that would be the end of it, as she has her own life and I have mine, and there’s a big disparity in our financial situations. I recently finished my masters and am looking for jobs or PhDs and she’s a senior partner at her firm. I thought out conversation would eventually die out but it never did. 

We kept meeting several times after, as she came to visit me whenever she could. I’m beyond thankful that she decided to spend every single holiday she had by coming to visit me, which also made me feel very warm inside knowing that she could’ve traveled anywhere else to explore the world yet she decided to came to the same country over and over. 

What started as something casual eventually kept developing into something I don’t know how to call, but definitely not casual. We talk every single day, all the time, and have an incredible chemistry. I obviously began developing strong feelings for her and a bit over half a year after we met, I decided to confess her my feelings and tell her I was in love with her and that I loved her. Hearing her saying that her feelings are reciprocate has been one of the best moments of this whole year. 

Future is uncertain because she is from country A, working in country B but disliking it and considering moving somewhere else; while I am from country C, graduated from and looking for jobs in country D. English isn’t our first language, and in country D (where I live) they speak another language and rarely use English, her native language, or my native language. Despite all this we agreed to let us enjoy the feelings we have for each other and try to see if we can make something work for us to be together. 

She is divorced, no kids, and I don’t know if I’m being too naive but more often than not I’ve been thinking that I would like to marry her and have a family with her. My feelings for her are very very strong and she genuinely makes me very happy. I don’t wanna get into too much detail about her personal life, but I know I also make her happy and have brought a happiness and peace into her life that she never felt before, which makes me very happy as well. 

I didn’t want to get into any LDR ever again but I just couldn’t help it. To be honest it even freaks me out a bit calling it a LDR because we haven’t established explicitly what we are. I know we are exclusive bc she told me it’s only been me since we met and I have no reason to not believe her, and the same goes for me. We have taken some tests together (love languages and such) and while doing so we both answered “yes i am in a relationship” so si guess we are? Although I would love to formally ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend/let me be her boyfriend once we clarify what the future holds.

Now the part where I seek for some advise: since a month ago (when I confessed her my feelings) I have been feeling everything very intensely. My main love language is words of affirmation and she comes from a background where she isn’t really used to that. Neither giving nor receiving. I understand it’s something relatively new to her, but I’ve explained her several times how it is a big deal to me. She tries her best but more often than not, this need is not fulfilled as I would like to. I obviously don’t want to become a drag and be complaining all the time but sometimes I just don’t know what to do, is it a common thing in older women to sometimes overlook this? It’s the first time in my life dating an older woman so I don’t really know how to operate. I am being too naive thinking about a potential future with her? Should I share this thoughts with her? Am I overstepping way too much? 
I feel a bit frustrated because never in any of my previous relationships have I felt a bit uneasy not knowing how to act regarding the future of the relationship, so I would appreciate any insights.

Well I have to say for the first time in 5+ years I've woken up not immediately thinking when I can next sleep, not thinking how strong coffee I can make, not feeling sleepy waiting at the first set of traffic lights. I'm an idiot for putting this off so long.

Actually the reason I put it off so long was money. After some family issues I cut up credit cards and have been powering towards debt freedom and without any credit facilities I just couldn't afford a CPAP and I refused the ""rent to own"" poor tax option of paying 3x full retail over 3 years. Though in hindsight (yeah I know) I would likely have gone back and paid it off weekly over three years and not cared about the interest. This is too important.

Anyway on Black Friday I picked up a VVFLY YA50G CPAP/APAP (USD $270 with everything), downloaded the app and off we go. I was amazed after a few minutes of ramping and timing changes (I'm learning the lingo 😎) it had perfectly adjusted to my breathing pre-empting what I needed and I drifted off, waking up a few hours in smooth air heaven (I normally wake up many times but only woke up a couple of times with CPAP despite getting used to nasal pillows).

Anyway here are my scores, settings and reports from a non-resmed machine. I apologise in advance if it's Resmed only here. Even though it's not Resmed I'm over the moon with how quiet the machine is, how smooth the air is, and how I didn't need to do anything. Once the algorithm has finished it's 40 hours monitoring cycle, if I don't like how it auto trims min and max (currently default 4 to 20hpa) I might consider trimming it myself based on what I've learned but maybe not. 😂

Won't hire people who don't ""fit well with the personalities- (aka back-stabbing, fake people)"" The supervisor also sits amongst the staff and shuffles papers to look busy for 8 hours then clocks out. 

You never, ever, do anyone else's work. You do what you're assigned, and honestly, you skip most of it, ignore all the CPT orders (throw an acapella in the room and say that's CPT), never communicate with the team about patient care, wait for the nurses to call you, wait for the doctors to call you. Your job is to sit in the department and wait to be told what to do. There are as close to zero expectations of you at this place.

1hkcqyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hkcqyu/i_am_the_only_surviving_crew_member_of_a_giant/,I am the only surviving crew member of a giant cargo ship. Please learn from my experiences... ,"There is no way to pace this story. Because my recollection of the event is like any other truly violent one, chaotic and instantaneous. None of lives tragic moments are long buildups to skilfully told releases, they are disorientatingly fleeting, only properly understood with hindsight. But I think the retelling is important. If only to remember what happened.

 

I am an electrician with a engineering degree. My father had a passion for boats and so naturally I spent some time in the navy. Although I learned much it is only important in so far as telling you that **I** was very qualified for my job. I worked on a cargo ship. That work was a very lonely existence. Hard to keep onto people when you are off shore for long stretches of time, especially women. I had a highschool sweetheart, and I spent time dating after we broke up. But no one could stomach my proffession, and having me in exile so consistently. So I make due with my own company. Sure when you are at sea you make friends for life, no way you can’t under those circumstanses. The thing is just that most of these friends for life, you won’t ever see again. Everyone takes jobs when they can, and that means spending a lot of time on the same ship with different men. The men with families plan their scheduals around those families, staying true to whats important to them. And therefore often fly home when we port. It is different when you are a single man. Work can become an escape from your life. It can keep your mind off the things you really need, keep you from improving, from finding solutions, making changes. It can ocupy your mind even if that mind hungers desperately for change, seeking anything but that horrible doomed loneliness at sea. Still the work makes you stay, it takes away the energy you need to wonder, and find better things.

 

The work that consumed my time on the waters was relativly simple. I did maintenance. Specifically for the stuff that had to work. Lights, sensors, engine control and so on. Anything where you would think an electrical signal resultet in the mechanical change of a system, I was the man you talked to. That made days simple, I had one tool that was always with me, a voltmeter. Wondering if current is passing through this wire? Simple as connecting to it and you will know. Making my rounds around the ship this way checking this and that, I was constantly running into the entire crew. We all knew each other well after no time at all, but from the perspective of others I get why I was always greeted with surprise. I knew where they where stationed, but they knew little of my rounds, or didn’t care to.

 

“Hey Jim! Finding it hard to stay away from me?”

 

It was Mark. Basically the only part of the crew I knew from earlier. He was such a lovely man. Kind hearted, helpful, understanding and full of playfull humor.

 

“Of cause, you’re magnetic.” I held up my voltmeter like it was dragging me to him.

 

He gave out a small snicker.

 

“What’s wrong with our ship today?” No one liked Justin. Not sure why. Maybe it was because he forced himself into stuff people weren’t interested in sharing with him. Or maybe it was just me, and I despised the fact he didn’t understand I wasn’t interested in having mine and Marks friendly jester bouts interposed with generic small talk. I had a fleeting thought occur to me then, of replying “you are the problem with our ship” but kept it to my self.

 

“As usual it’s just lose signals that are being tightened up. But you should be glad I’m not letting anyone in on how shitty our sonar is!”

 

All ships have a sonar that helps measure the depth to the seafloor. It isn’t really useful when your at the middle of the ocean, like we where at this time. But it can be extraordinarily important when close to shore. And if you are like most normal people you probably havn’t thought about how a sound based system knows what is underneath you and what is at the sides of you. After all it is a wave that just propagates out to all sides, so how would you know what the echo was bounced of off?

 

The reason why it works is answered by how it sounds. Multiple wavelengths of sound are emitted at once. The waves flow over each other creating interference. The image is then created by how these waves have changed when they come back. The waves spread out in 3d, and when the sound is bounced of an object all of the components, with different wavelenghts, are shifted in relation to each other. Where there once was negativ interferance there is now positive, and maybe, vice versa. Allowing you with some math to know what direction the return signal is coming from. Interferance like this is crazy complecated.

When interference is between two waves in head on collision it is relatively easy to understand. But when waves can spread between each other in 3d, or even 2d surfaces like an ocean, it immediately becomes very hard to grasp how they interact. But this complicated interaction is why sonar works, and simultaneously why ours wasn’t always able too.

Because in some cases different wavelengths interact in such an unfortunate manner as to create spots of hyper enlarged magnitudes. Basically a single spot can be placed in a location where all waves peak together, right at that same intersection spot. Creating a wave of such intensity that it can fry the system, simply by being literal hundreds of times bigger than the equipment was ever designed to withstand. A rogue wave, as it is called. And it just so happens that our sonar has a tendency to create such waves much more frequently than you would expect.

 

“Let me guess, it’s so bad as to basically be like going in blind?” I din’t answer Justin this time. Just looked at Mark as I went by them onto the next task.

 

“Don’t have to much fun without me now” I didn’t pity Mark having to stay with Justin.

 

That evening we were all called in to eat together, which was a rare event. The captain chose to give us some bad news, in a nice setting. Not that the room was nice, just that company was. Imagine a ship and you will know what it looked like. Cramped, iron walls spray-painted with a thick layer of white-ish paint, fluorescent lights, tables mounted to the floor the feeling was like you had chosen to live with 15 other men in a floating prison. What a brutal proffesion.

 

“okay, so. SO WE are about a couple of days. A day or two out from really bad winds.” We all knew what that meant, even if his look hadn’t been so stern. Our captain was a man with many many years of expertise. That he even called a meeting meant this was critical information. And getting a wind warning out on sea, didn’t mean strong winds. It meant waves.

 

“and of cause that means dangerous waters” The weight of his words draped over us like a duvet. Just like any slumber party anything outside of it became a distant reality.

 

I broke the silence

 

“How tall are we expecting them?” The captain turned his eyes to meet mine.

 

“The important thing is that we prepare for it, that’s the only focus at this point. Everybody on board with that assessment?” He turned his gaze towards the room. He didn’t know the answer, which was frightening.

 

“sounds good cap” A few of the men said uncoordinatedly. Allowing his desperate plea to let his ignorance slip under the rug.

 

That night I dreamt terrible things. I dreamt that all of us was in the lifeboat. The ship slowly taking on water, we had managed to make an escape. But the lifeboat wouldn’t unlatch. With such a technical fault, I dreamt of the men arguing, to some degree violently. They where choosing a crew-member to unlatch it from the outside. Staying back with the cargo on the doomed vessel. And logically, at least to my dreaming mind, they chose me. I was the only one that knew how to operate the latching mechanism. And being forced to step out from the security of the life boat I watched Mark fight back against the group consensus. Landing backwards on the though metal of the cargo ship, I watched the men that threw me give way to an enourmous version of Marks head. Marks head filling the entire doorway with his big teary eyes. As the ship started listing I got to my feet, a new directive being installed into my being. Survival was no longer an option. Only the ability to save my tribe remained. Saving Mark. Dreams are weird conglamerations of ideas. And I don’t know if we hugged but we deffinitly exchanged a deepfelt goodbye. And I grabed the small pin keeping me from ridding the boats of shackles. Pushing it of the ship I watched as I was ripped from exsistence by my own heroism.

 

“You slept okay Jim?” Mark handed me a much needed coffee. Even if I had slept well I wouldn’t have been able to make coffee in this sea. Contrary to common belief a ship doesn’t sway every which way. The ship is most well equipped going straight onto the waves. The captain going in head on to the waves meant you could be pretty sure what ways you would be thrown. Although the sea wasn’t bad enough to throw us yet. But you could feel the winds the captain had promised, had worse in store for us when we reached them. I accepted the coffee graciously.

 

“thank you” a small smile towards him was unwillingly given off my lips.

“well I actually slept quite poorly.” I directed my following inquiry to the entire room.

“does anyone here know how to keep the lifeboat clamps engaged?” The question was vague. I designed it that way. Such that it would only get a reply from someone I could trust with the task.

 

“Yes sure why? Anything wrong with the controls?” This was my guy. A man named Joshua.

 

“No not necessarily, I just havn’t gotten around to check the circuitry is all. I need a hand with keeping the boat on tight whilst im in there. You have time?” Mark let off a smirk.

 

“arrhh” He muttered whilst bringing back my attention to him.

 

“Sure, holla when you need me.” After Joshua’s affirmation I returned to Mark with a disapproving look.

 

“Grab a jacket Joshua, it’s getting cramped in here.” Mark’s smirk disappeared.

 

Making our way outside wasn’t as bad as I had expected, yet not easy. The waves at this point being no more than an omen of the storm to come. Only the swinging oceanic vibrations, manifesting in the waves we now felt, had been able to travel far enough to reach us. The problem was that the seemingly random intervals between the waves made it hard to discern a pattern to the swaying they created. When walking you ended up having little indication of when they would hit. And looking out over the water the only regularity I could discern to their motion was their direction.

 

The lifeboat hang at a fortfive degree angle of the side of the ship. It Was orange. And it was very awkward to get into. I stepped up next to it with Joshua.

 

“Know what to do?”

 

“Yes sir” Joshua answered sarcastically. I waited for another respons. He didn’t get the hint.

 

“yes sir” he repeated. Now with obedience.

 

“And what are you doing?” He had a look of embarrassment on his face, as he understood what I had meant all along.

 

“I’ll be standing here holding onto the release, stopping the pin from disengaging.” I nodded.

 

“Great thank you Joshua.” With our roles defined I moved into the small canister.

 

Taking a hand to the top of the door I put my foot onto the sloped floor. What a terrible design choice this was. Ducking into it I used one hand to grab seats on the way down to the control panel, the other hand tightly gripping my trusty voltmeter. Each step into the maw of it my movement became more and more fluid, whilst my anxiety in turn grew worse and worse.

As I came closer to its control panel, I could see more and more ocean through the tiny, enforced windows. The waves were scattered across the ocean, like an ill commanded army their power was laughable. Given proper coordination they would have been capable of much greater feats than putting us of balance. I sat myself in the captain’s chair of the small tin.

 

“Joshua you there?” I spoke with more nervousness that I thought I would. I wasn’t afraid of falling into the water. I was afraid the boat would fall into the water. Sure, I could get back on the ship. But the boat. Our only safety would be lost forever.

 

“Yes, I’m here. Holding the release pin. You are clear.”

 

I popped the control panel. I looked for the wire that connected to the release button. It was in a cluster of wires that went to the door. This system had plenty of redundancy. Which was good, and unexpected honestly. Looks like my nightmare was unsubstantiated. But not checking the signal now would be silly. I placed my voltmeter on my lap and removed one of the measuring clamps. Slowly I extended my hand and put the clamp to just one of the release wires. Once in place I retracted my hand and went for the next clamp on the device. Reaching forward I put the other clamp on the same wire, completing the circuit.

 

“Pressing release.” I warned Joshua.

 

“You are clear.” Joshua replied.

 

I pressed the button. It lit up green. My voltmeter spiked. The mechanism worked. There was no movement. Relief.

 

“Okay yeah I felt it kick, what a kick, it works alright!” The powerful joy in his last affirmation was exactly what I needed.

 

“Perfect. Thank You Joshua, I’m packing up in hear you can relax again.”

 

Leaning down I went to take away one of the clamps. But Joshua interrupted me.

 

“Oh MY GOD. JIM; JIIIM”

 

I looked out the small window in front of me. The ocean was full of smaller yet dangerous waves travelling incoherently. But a pattern had emerged from their movement. And one peak had formed to such enormous mass that it began towering over the ship. We were going to get hit. And the ship would not be able to handle it. I went into shock. Everything slowed down. Watching that wave grow. Every gut-wrenching moment vividly detailed.

First was the rain. The wind blew of the water from it and showered the ship. This is when I remember the horn sounding. A useless attempt at a warning. The next I remember was feeling our enormous cargo ship being lifted out of the water with a dizzying speed and ease. The rogue wave rolling us over. I felt my body being accelerated by gravity with my back first into the seat, a direction I hadn’t expected gravity to pull. Looking back towards Joshua I hoped he had made it into the lifeboat with me. Only to see him being swept of his feet plummeting toward a background of blue, that I couldn’t determine if was ocean or sky. Being snapped out of my catatonic state, I hammered my hand into the release button on the console. The next thing. Was the impact. First, I heard the sound of waves impact the cargo ship. It sounded like someone had pitch shifted the crumbling of an aluminum can. The sheer brutality of the sound a dire reminder of the frailty of steel. Then the lifeboat was sent to the heavens. This boat, which was designed to plummet into waters from great heights was dented by the force. I dare not imagine what had happened if the wave had collided with it in any other manner than head on. I was thrown out of my seat and only barely saved my head from colliding with the inside of the lifeboat by sacrificing an arm. The wrist of which was pulverised, the halfway point of the arm having bones rushing out the skin in feeble attempt to escape the rest of the massacre. Landing on the floor I felt the lifeboat accelerate upwards. Emerging from the waters I and it was sent airborne again. When it hit the water I came crashing to a halt on the floor.

Abusing the adrenaline to ignore the pain, I scurried to get on my feet. I looked out the window for any signs of life. By some miracle I found it. A tiny spec of man was in the waters not that far from me.

 

It was Joshua, but the wave had already claimed him. The impact of the water had mauled him worse than a big rig ever could. There was blood all around him, and I could only see one of his arms flailing in an attempt to help himself afloat. His movements looked like the spasms executed by a mechanical doll, preprogrammed and soulless. If He wasn’t already following gods light, the only humane thing was to let him. The Ship was gone. Only white foam on water and shifting waves remained on the sea. And as if someone had put the water underneath the vessel to a boil, air bubbles from the ship where rushing to the surface. The sheer volume of air the enormous exhalation from the cavities of the sinking iron long that I had called home, and that now others would find their grave. The thought that this air meant that Mark could be trapped in their. Still being in panic and falsly clinning onto hope deep benaeth the ocean. The thought filled me with terror.

I was watching a scene of complete erasure. No evidence left behind of the carnage that had taken so much from so many. And as a devilish answer to my newfound dispair, evidence was brought back from the deep. Crates of cargo started erupting up from the water. Like floats that had been submerged, their buoyancy lifted the crates so violently that they became airborne. Careening out of the water soaring into the skies. Their reentry into the waters defaced them to liken accordions by the force of it. As much as I could have risked searching for survivors, seeing 20 foot crates, tons of steel shot from the ocean, only to come hailing down again; I had to get away.

 

Days later I was picked up as the only surviver. Many ships go down like this every year. Rogue waves are not a myth. They do happen. And you just have to pray, that it won’t be close to you.

1hkcnyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkcnyg,My ranking of all the Aldi Christmas treats I’ve tried,"(Including some photos of the treats I still had on hand) 

In the last month, I’ve tried most but not all of the Aldi seasonal treats and including my personal opinions and ranking below. Which products that I didn’t try should I try to snag before they’re gone? Would love to hear other people’s opinions on the best seasonal products from this year!

28. Choceur European Chocolate Box - I saw the negative reviews here but still had to try for myself. Complete trash, on par with Palmer’s or another brand that legally cannot even call itself real chocolate.

27. Benton’s Pfeffernusse Cookies - I enjoy a typical German gingerbread, but these cookies were far too anise tasting for me (licorice flavor). Totally personal preference, if that’s your thing you would probably like these much more.

26. Moser Roth Chocolate Truffle Stars - Honestly, these were fine, but for the price and limited quantity ($4.50 for 10 pieces) they weren’t that good and the other chocolate options were much better. White chocolate flavor is also meh.

25. Choceur Milk Chocolate Peanut Clusters - Saw the positive reviews here and tried these, I thought they were fine but nothing special to me personally. Tastes like a Baby Ruth bar minus the nougat.

24. Choceur Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bar - Not bad, but not something I’d buy again. I like dark chocolate, but the peppermint filling in this was a weird sort of toothpaste like texture that I didn’t love.

23. Moser Roth Salted Caramel Truffles - I liked these but compared to all the other treats, they weren’t as special to me. Not a ton of caramel flavor but still a decent quality truffle for the price ($2.99).

22. Friendly Farms Almond Nog - As a lactose intolerant person, I appreciate the almond nog! Not the richness of an actual egg nog, but the flavor is there and a decent (and less calorie-dense) alternative.

21. Benton’s Wafer Assortment - Decent wafer cookies and good variety, but doesn’t compare to the higher tier range of cookies from the seasonal line.

20. Benton’s Soft Gingerbread Cookies - Classic soft gingerbread cookie, not everyone’s cup of tea, but I like these.

19. Choceur Dark Chocolate Covered Cranberries - These were a tasty combo and I like the less sweet dark chocolate along with the more tart cranberry. Solid snack.

18. Benton’s Cookie Assortment - I thought these were a bit better than the wafer assortment and the chocolate quality still is pretty decent.

17. Choceur European Chocolates in Gifting Tin - Note: these are NOT the same chocolates as in the Choceur European Box, quality is much better and the variety of fillings is good. The gifting tins are cute as well and make a good item to bring to a holiday party or use as a gift at $9.99.

16. Benton’s Almond Spekulatious Cookies - I like the Spekulatious cookies, the almond was my least favorite of the 3, but still pretty good and great with almond nog!

15. Benton’s Butter Spekulatious Cookies - Decent for butter cookies, but I do wish there was a little more butter/salty flavor and less sugar.

14. Benton’s Candy Cane Sandwich Cremes - A classic cookie, it’s not Christmas time without these. Love ‘em, and they’re best eaten dipped in the milk of your choice!

13. Clancy’s Peppermint Drizzled Kettle Corn - I bought these expecting to not like them, but was pleasantly surprised. The peppermint drizzle works well with the salty sweetness of the kettle corn. Recommend for anyone who hasn’t tried these yet.

12. Benton’s Spiced Spekulatious Cookies - favorite of the Spekulatious cookies, these taste like Biscoff cookies but with a better and less crumbly texture. Plus the bag is bigger than the other varieties which is nice.

11. Choceur Christmas Bark Sampler - these were better than I expected and it’s a cute idea. The milk chocolate w/candy gems was ok, but I really liked the cookies and cream and dark chocolate bark.

10. Clancy’s Peppermint Pretzel Stars - one of the few items that didn’t make it more than 2 days in the house. The combo of salty and sweet was awesome, with just the right amount of peppermint candy to be refreshing but not overpowering.

9. Benton’s Dark Chocolate Gingerbread Hearts - these were so good! The soft gingerbread, apricot filling, and chocolate coating went well together, and the cookies stayed soft after opening too.

8. Choceur Dark Chocolate Peppermint Marshmallows - So good, these were delicious and not too sweet but perfectly balanced both flavors. The marshmallows were really well shaped and firm and seemed high quality.

7. Choceur Chocolate Peppermint Almonds - I didn’t expect to rank these this high when I bought them, but it’s a phenomenal combination. I really like that there’s a dark chocolate coating on the almond as well as a white chocolate peppermint coating too.

6. Bakeshop Gingerbread Sandwich Cookies - I know these were a weekly find and not available all season, but I had to shout them out. The soft gingerbread cookie and the cream cheese frosting worked so well together, these were a great treat!

5. Choceur Peppermint Cookie Clusters - Love these. It’s basically Oreo type cookies, caramel, fudge, and peppermint mashed into a cluster. Everything is pretty balanced and the caramel texture is really good too.

4. Benton’s Milk Chocolate Gingerbread Hearts - I liked these better than the dark chocolate version even though I’m more of a dark chocolate person generally. The milk chocolate goes really nicely with the gingerbread and these are awesome.

3. Choceur Dark Chocolate Marzipan Log - Here is my bias showing, I absolutely love marzipan and Aldi does it right. Dark chocolate/marzipan combo absolutely slaps and at $2.69/bar, this is half the price of anything comparable I’ve found at other stores.

2. Benton’s Fudge Covered Peppermint Cremes - Absolutely legendary. Pop them in the freezer and it is total perfection, especially with a hot cup of coffee or cocoa on the side.

1. L’Oven Fresh Marzipan Stollen Bites - I’d had the Aldi cherry stollen in the past, but I didn’t think they’d be able to effectively capture the stollen flavor and texture in a bite size cookie. I was totally wrong and as soon as I bit into one of these, I knew it was going to be my favorite. Perfectly composed but still moist as you’d in a good stollen, with a dollop of marzipan in the center and enrobed in plenty of powdered sugar. These will be an annual buy for me assuming Aldi continues to sell them. Highly recommend for the stollen or marzipan lover! I’m still going to try and see if I can try the apple version before the season is over.

1hkcna7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hkcna7/reviewing_your_2024_fragrance_purchases/,Reviewing your 2024 Fragrance Purchases,"2024 was the first year that I really tracked my fragrance purchases and there two types of fragramces I was chasing all year:   1) Gourmands and 2) Tea scents.

Looking back at daily scents that I wore in 2024, I kept a daily journal entry of what perfumes I wore each day so that I could go back and see what bottles I reached for the most and which ones I didn’t.

Something that I learned about myself this year was that I love the idea of Gourmands but I didn’t necessarily reach for my Gourmands as much as I thought I would.   I didn’t make any blind purchases this year…I smelled and tested every gourmand before I bought the bottle.  However I guess  after the thrill of the purchase dies down,, I wouldn’t reach for the gourmands as much as I thought I would.  For example, I was so excited to purchase Mancera - Tonka Cola.  And I was obsessed with coffee scents like Montale - Intense Cafe, Akro - Awake, and Kayali Oudgasm Coffee.  But I hardly reach for those bottles after wearing them a few times.

As for tea scents, I did purchase a few tea scents that have been a part of my perfume rotation and I’m really glad I bought them but there were also a few perfumes that I loved the idea of (i.e. Memo  Paris - Winter Palace), where I liked the smell and it was pleasant smelling but I didn’t reach for the bottle as much.  

I do have my favourite scents like Le Labo - The Noir 29, PDM - Delina, GdT - BIanco Latte etc, that I go back to all the time.  And I have the statistics to prove it since I’m tracking what I’m wearing everyday.   

I think in 2025 I’m going to be even more selective in my purchases and not just buy something because of the hype and tiktok marketing.  

Have any of you thought about how you will change your buying habits in 2025?   I’m interested in hearing what you learned about yourself in 2024.",5,1734916390.0,fragrance,2,0.86,False

Kun-Nar Gud woke up and stretched, then climbed over the two women in his bed. He blessed them last night, and they had been eager to please for the honor. He walked to his bathroom and cleaned himself; his wife, Shina, came in with a smile on her lips. “You look happy?” he said, and she nodded.  “We hunted down that heretic; he is down in the dungeons where he belongs. I see you had your fun last night.”  She replied as she looked towards the bed, and he chuckled.

 “They are all yours if you want them. I will deal with the heretic and then talk with the Ten about what to do with that fake one.”  He replied as he studied himself in the mirror. He was a stranger to this region; his soft green-scaled skin gleamed slightly in the light, and his golden eyes had an implant that allowed him to see color instead of only the heat that his people normally saw. His long bluish hair hung in a braid over his shoulder, revealing a muscular body with a few faded scars. It had been a long time since anybody had been able to touch him; all his scares had faded except the one over his chest, the one that they thought would have killed him, but Shina saved him from. He had to smile; no vital organs were there, but it made for a nice show. And now they called him Galios; as long as he freed slaves, they gave their loyalty to him. Every freed one was a soldier in his army. And the army had grown from 10 to 7000 strong; they gave him their daughters to aid him. He pitied them, but sometimes, the weak needed a strong leader to lead them out of the darkness. He was that man; he would teach them how to be strong, fight back, break their chains, and put them in chains instead.

She looked at the woman and smiled. For a scisya, she was beautiful. Her skin was almost as golden as her eyes, and she had bright red hair and a body that was kept in good shape. There was not a blemish on her skin, and he loved her for it. “I don’t see the harm in indulging myself. It might calm them down as well to let them know I have no ill will against them.“ She kissed him before making her way to his bed. He smiled and got dressed, then grabbed his weapon belt and walked out of his room. The guards outside saluted him, and he nodded back. Then he called up Ur-Shar, his second-in-command and known among the men as the god of war; what species was this brute? He had no idea, but he didn’t care. He was great at his job. He had bluish skin and was built as a rock, bipedal, but sometimes, he used his powerful arms as well. His species had short legs but big, powerful arms and a face only a mother could love. A human might see him as a shaved- dressed-up gorilla. His voice was gruff as he got near him.  “Master! You called?”  
“Yeah, we have to deal with the heretic; before he dies, we need to find out everything about his master, the one called Adam Wrangler.”

 

 

 

 

Adam woke up alone in bed. He could hear Evelyn singing in the shower, and he scratched his head as he wondered how she got up first today. Well, he would not let this stop him, so he turned on [some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR0E8p2kYHE) and went to join her.

After breakfast, they went to the admin building to check the work. Nobody had shown up yet, so they enjoyed the peace and quiet. After they had kicked everybody out of Piradas, they had much calmer mornings. They knew there were probably five in the base already, doing different work, but the Admin was still on night statues, so the two guys in the tower were keeping track of everything.  Adam sat down in the main console and put his coffee down. Evelyn sat down on the closet console, and they both started to work.

“Oxygen is up 0.001%, so you are up to 10.134%. “ She turned to look at him. “How the hell are you getting it to rise so fast?”

“Vorts algae’s! They eat carbon dioxide and spew oxygen, duplicating every six hours. Our problem will soon be that they cover all the ocean surfaces. We need to get the fish going to slow it down. Add his mushrooms, which are basically oxygen factories. Have you seen the size of those bastards? And the best part: They don’t need Nitrogen?” Adam replied, and Evelyn thought about it. Those mushrooms won't survive a high-nitrogen environment. They need only Carbon, if I remember correctly. “

“Yeah, but that was the plan; they will decompose and become soil.  Besides unchecked, they will cover the whole planet; most planets have banned them outright.”

Evelyn checked the statues, “Well, the nitrogen level is up half a percent, so if they might start to affect those mushrooms.”

“As planned, so then we have to replace them with grass. Jork is working on something there. Everything seems to be green here. Ohh. Knug sent a message, another order. It's getting higher and higher. At this speed, we need to build more factories. Jork will be happy when he hears that.”

“Oh, he will be happy at any attempt to build something new; anyway, are we going to the Zoo Vorts setup?  I kind of want to see just how many animals he has managed to make by now.”

“You just want to give Sisi a brother.” Adam teased, and she came over.

“She needs a big brother who can protect her, a big scary dog.” She said, leaning over the desk with her cute smile and perfect eyes.

“You just want a puppy!”

“Yes, please; thank you so much.” She replied, a puppy named Beast, if I remember correctly? A  Cane Corso?”  He said, and she tried to look innocent and hide her excitement. “Moi? “  She replied. And Adam shook his head.

“Let's go wake up, Vorts. I think we have that DNA template. “ Then he called Vorts and agreed to drop by his new station. It had three domes filled with life. Adam looked at Evelyn and was about to say something when a report popped up, and he tilted his head.

“Do you remember those ancient structures we found?” he asked, and Evelyn nodded and moved over to him.

“What did you find?” She asked, and Adam brought it up on the screen. “It is as I thought. This planet was alive before. Look at oil deposits and coal deposits. If we look harder, I’m sure we will also find fossils.”

“Well, it solves one problem, "" she replied, and Adam looked at her as she smiled. “Plastic in all its forms.”

 

 

 

 

Kun-Nar Gud walked out of the dungeon. “What a fool! I mean, why didn’t he give us anything? He was just babbling about Adam letting him go. What idiot orders his slave to leave and take care of his mother?”

‘What should we do with him?” Ur-Shar replied, and Kun-Nar looked back at the cell, “he disappeared. Nobody learned about him; we can't have this as a public trial. He starts spewing that noise about Adam; then we might have more heretics. Damn it; I think Burmio has finally shown his face; it's no wonder they call him the deceiver. I would believe him to be me if I didn't know any better.”

Ur-Shar walked next to him, listening, then saw a guard and gave the order to get rid of the heretic; the Haran guard nodded and walked into the cell of the dying Scisya. then they made their way up to the throne room where the others were waiting. He sat down on the throne and looked at the two men standing in front of him, corporation men.

“You are brave enough to venture into my domain! Tell me why I should not have you killed and your ship seized.”

“That ships? You can take it; it’s a gift from us for you. We want to show you that we have no ill will towards you. As to kill me? I’m a simple messenger; if I am not returned, then the five battlecruisers hiding behind the moon will start planetary bombardment. But as I said, we are not here to start a war. We might disagree on certain matters but have a common enemy.” The Wossir man said, or what a human would call a walking turtle with no shell. He seemed quite relaxed, and Kun-Nar looked at his security adviser, who just smiled.

“I fear no battle cruisers on the moon, and to prove it, "" he lifted his finger. On a screen, they saw one of the ships being blown up as the hidden and cloaked particle gun blew a big hole in the nearest ship. Around the planet, a few other cannons decloaked.

“Tell them to withdraw, and we can talk, or I will destroy them all as they are!” The Wossir looked shocked, and the second man, also a Wossir, quickly gave the order to withdraw.

“Where did you get Haran weaponry and Ghorst cloaking? “ The messenger said, and Kun-Nar laughed.  
“You think that is Haran weaponry?  That is my people's weapon. So let's cut to the core and tell me why you are here.”

“I think you have by now heard of the other man who claims, falsely, that he is Galios? This human name Adam Wrangler?” The dossier explained, and Kun-Nar nodded.

“Yes, what does that have to do with me? “ he asked as he shifted in the seat.

“We know we can't fight the real Galios, and you just proved you are him. So we would rather work with you, but the fake one, the Burmio, he is bad for everybody. He brings war and chaos. You are here to free slaves, war always put more people in chains.”

“Yes, but if they just win, then it’s the heretics that will wear those chains. “ He replied.

“And we want to be on the winning side; we are not evil nor heretics; we are businessmen. Without us, the world would stop, so we would offer an alliance. You rid us of Adam, and we will turn a blind eye when you deal with your enemies. Just leave the businessmen of the mega-corporations alone. In return we will offer your enemies no safe haven. Deal?”

“All mega corporations are behind this? “

“All but four, The Vikons, the Tribish,  Ranoms and the Conta-ons. And we are willing to sacrifice the Urubas as we know you have an agenda against them, all others are in an agreement.” He said.

“Does those four know about this deal? Will any of them warn him?”  Kun-Nar asked and the Wossir shook his head.

“No, we asked some innocent questions about whether those four might try to cut a deal with him. The Urabas's leading trade is slaves, so we knew you would not side with them as You have sworn to stop the Scisya slave trade. We can divide their other franchises among us after that; they are mainly Sanders, anyway. “

“Okay, we have a deal, but I will do it my way. I have already heard of that miserable attack by those pirates.” He replied, and the Wossir nodded again.

“The idiot who was in charge of that has been dealt with, and as I said, The ship is yours. There is another gift there for you: one million credits. Now I will take my leave, and I hope you understand the sensitive matter so this discussion does not leave the room.”

Kun-Nar chuckles, “Paranoid bastard, get out of my sight.”

When the two Wossir had left the room, he turned his attention to the others.  
“We use assassin. Who do you suggest?”

“The best would be Sig-San if we can find him. If not, then there are the Ghort and Sly-Na of the Haran. If you want to go for a clan, then I suggest the Myrtas and the Jurtda. They all know how to work together, so we won't need to worry about them messing up the kill.”  Jurdu, his Tufon assassin, replied.

“Why not you?”  Kun-Nar replied, and Jurdu chuckled.

“Because his second in command knows me and wants me dead. I killed his brother and almost got his sister, too.  This is why he left the military; he wanted to protect her. I don’t care about her anymore, but he will kill me on sight, and he is close to the target.”

Kun-Nar smirked. “Then kill him; I don’t need you going around looking over your shoulder after this is done. You hire those others, and you kill this second in command and the sister; finish your jobs; never do anything half done.”

Jurdu grinned. “As you command.”

 

Yes, I know there is a lot of new information, but give it time. There are many mega-corporations. Every species has probably two or more. Think of them as multinational companies; we have over 60,000 now on earth. Who is this new character, and what species? Wait and see, it’s a large galaxy, and you sometimes have to wait for the answers.

And for the music, a quick question. Does this sound like Adam to you?",13,1734916296.0,HFY,6,0.89,False
1hkck4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/1hkck4s/what_advice_do_dumpers_get/,What advice do dumpers get?,"So I just got broken up with by my ex boyfriend a few weeks ago. Reasons are he felt overwhelmed by me, also felt like he wasn’t good enough for me and there was the potential that we’d have to go long distance.

We were both each other’s first relationship, he asked me out on the third date. Keep in mind that our dates all lasted for like a whole day other than the first where we got coffee and sat in a park from 3 to 9. Even though we haven’t dated for long only two months, we spent a lot of time together. I’d be over at his place every week and had dinner with his family. We went to the beach, more picnic dates, hiking and camping. His mom and siblings were really nice to me, and I really bonded with his dog, taught her a new trick too. His mom told me he was opening up in a new way, a version of him she’s never seen. 


I even went over for thanksgiving at his place and he introduced me to all his aunts, uncle, grandparents, cousins etc. One of his aunts even sat down and told me that he’s a really special guy, and hoped I’d be good for him. I replied that I also thought he was really special and I’d never hurt him on purpose. All and all his family seemed to be happy to see me and said they were looking forward to seeing me on Christmas.

Fast forward a week, he broke up with me in his car. He had been distant two days before even canceling our plans, but I tried to be supportive and gave him the space he asked for. 

He called the same day asking to try again, but I was hurt and upset so I told him I needed space. Hindsight I regret picking up the phone, we were both too emotional. But what’s done is done, at least I was honest with what I felt.

He hasn’t responded to any of my texts to call or to talk. It’ll be Christmas soon and I’m curious if what his family would say to him. Would they tell him to move on? What advice would people close give him, if the relationship was good?

At the end of the night I walked her to her car and we hugged I wanted to go in for a kiss, but there seemed like a pause and it was a little awkward, it was also 3 degrees out and we were both freezing.

1hkcd4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hkcd4e/hard_day_at_work/,Hard day at work,"As a bit of backround I’m 16M and I’ve been working at a trampoline park in my city for about a month now, it’s my first job and so far apart from the odd few difficult customers and busy times it’s been a pretty light job. I also have been trained to work on multiple stations, being which are the trampoline Marshall, receptionist and front of house cafe worker (the latter being where I worked today). Despite working here a month and going through almost 10 shifts this is only my second shift behind the cafe, so I’m still a bit slow on how to make stuff and such.

Firstly, I managed to screw up at least 2 people’s orders which led to them being rude to me, which to an extent is understandable but saying I’m incompetent wasn’t too helpful. Another couple also came in with 14 tokens (free/pre-paid food) and each one was a different order and they refused to order slowly and kept trying to rush me and had a condescending undertone to anything I asked them, with the husband just saying I had no clue what I was doing and yelling at my manager to just do it for me because I’m incapable of completing their order. It was a Sunday so throughout the shift it got very busy at times and became overwhelming as there was no one I could properly ask for help and it was just me there. All of this wouldn’t be such a big deal if it wasn’t for the closing part of the shift.

Closing is just where all the staff on different areas clean/do chores for their area and there’s checklists for each station, and cafe has the biggest one. There was so much rubbish and food left out on tables from people who had an impromptu party (we have party rooms but they just wanted to occupy 6 tables and have their own party) alwhilst making a complete mess not bothering to put anything into or at least near the overflowing bins. I only had an hour to do almost 40 tasks by myself whilst the other person who was supposed to help me was either on her phone or chatting in the kitchen with her bf on call, according to the manager she was “doing a deep clean of the kitchen” but I’m also not stupid and saw her doing none of that. I then proceed to spend the next almost 2 hours running around completing as much as I can off the checklist; tidying, sweeping, vacuuming, wiping tables, mopping, taking out and replacing bins, cleaning coffee machines, restocking anything imaginable. Basically everything had to be done in the hour (we closed at 5 and my shift supposed to end at 6). At around 6:40 my manager yells for me to come over to him, so I jog over and he has a full on go at me, asking what I’ve been doing for almost 2 hours citing that I “hadn’t done anything” for that time. I told him everything I did and how messy the cafe dining area was but he decided that I was just being slow (sweated through my shirt working whilst “being slow”) and saw 2 bin bags yet to be taken out (out of the 16ish that I’d taken out that night) and a box of empty bottles that I hadn’t taken out to the bins out back, all meaning to him that I was a slacker, when in my opinion I’d done the most work there, which made me feel like my work and the crap I did and put up with all day to this point meant nothing. Why was he in such a hissy fit you may ask? Because he now had to wipe down half of a counter that I missed out on early, only because he himself asked me to get started on clearing up the dining area! He then proceeded to tell me to “start pulling my weight or don’t bother to show up to your next shift”. I just say yes sir, apologise again and run back to finish what I had left to do which was only about 3 minutes worth of work anyway before I was done for the night.

The final kicker was when I went to clock out I put my time code in and it asked me to clock in instead of clock out, which was odd as i swore i did clock in earlier, so it should be asking me to clock out now? Well I was right, as i look on our work app and it shows my shift was from 1-6, and by this point it’s 6:58, meaning that my manager had clocked me out already an hour prior and never told me. So I’d just spent the past hour working my ass off, getting yelled at and being threatened with being fired all whilst being paid a total of nothing. By this point I’m just close to tears so I tell my supervisor (chill guy, not my manager) that I’m off so he opens the doors for me and I walk to my bus, admittedly tearing up on the way there whilst messaging my circle of friends about what happened. On the bus back I break down, which isn’t an often occurrence and have only done maybe 2/3 times this year, as I normally just try brush things off and move on, but today had just not been a great day at work. I pull myself together as more people get on the bus a couple stops later and walk home after getting off the bus myself. It’s been a couple hours since I got home and I dread working the next 7 hour shift I have in the cafe after Christmas, thank god it’s not a closing down shift.

Thanks for reading if you’ve gotten this far, I just needed someone to vent to as I don’t talk to many people anymore since my gf broke up with me a few weeks ago, it feels like somehow after she broke up with me it’s made life quieter with less ppl to talk to. I miss talking to her and I would’ve told her all of this if we were still together. I know it’ll all get better soon but it currently feels so far off to the point where I’m doubting myself.",1,1734915508.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

For context: I am experiencing extreme fatigue even after sleeping 8+ hours, coffee does not help, I am feeling cold all the time, I've noticed weight gain/difficulty in losing weight, and have no other symptoms. First set of bloodwork was done 5 weeks ago with a TSH result of 7.84. My doctor prescribed 40,000mg of Vitamin D every week and to follow-up with bloodwork in a month. There have been no changes in my fatigue with the Vitamin D as of now.

My bloodwork came back yesterday with my TSH at 7.83 and I was told was to just get tested again in either 6 or 12 months. I'm very concerned as I am going back to the office (I work remotely) in the new year and all she suggested was to take female multivitamins to help with fatigue. Opinions? Thank you very much.

The same doesn't happen if I drink tea with sugar and milk. My immediate thought was that it was because I was having less water so I started drinking more water and I have noticed the smell to reduce as the color of pee from changes yellow to nearly clear, but the smell still lingers.

1hkcasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1hkcasy/off_vyvanse_for_the_holidays/,Off Vyvanse for the holidays,"Hi all, I just thought I would share my obversations after being off Vyvanse for 3 weeks. I've been on 50mg for about 4 years. It was a lifesaver - helping me focus and 'do the things'...especially at work where I was trying to finish a million tasks but never knew where to start. I lost 20+ kilos in the first 18 months on it as it reduced my appetite. This was a huge bonus given I was overweight. I loved the energy and clarity it gave me. 

However...I turned 44 recently and the dreaded peri menopause has hit. I noticed the Vyvanse stopped working as well after a couple of years but combined with the hormonal fluctuations of peri, it barely seemed to work at all. I believe oestregen impacts dopamine so it almost felt like a game of rock paper scissors. Oestrogen (rock) overpowering Vyvanse (scissors). I'm permanently exhausted, I've gained a heap of weight and my mood has gone downhill. I started hormone replacement therapy and have had some success but still trying to find my balance.

I decided to stop taking Vyvanse for a while, at least while on holidays since I'm off work for a few weeks and don't need to concentrate. Plus, I wanted to try and pay attention to my hormones without medications impacting things. Here's what I've noticed...

- I didn't have withdrawal symptoms coming off it. I didn't taper, rather just decided to stop. I've done this before for a couple of days (e.g. a weekend and during the recent worldwide shortage) so thankfully this time was no different. Surprising given its amphetamine based..but I guess being a controlled daily dose it didn't leave me feeling low or depressed like I've felt before when coming off SSRI/anti depressant medication. Just my experience - follow your own doctors advice and let your body be your guide.

 - I'm sleeping better (although some times during my cycle my sleep is still disrupted). I'm still tired though and when I wake up, it takes me ages to get going (as opposed to having Vyvanse kick in after an hour and go go go). I've even fallen asleep on the couch a few times which I never do. So I'm embracing naps!

-I've slowed down. My mind, my body, everything. This is good and bad...it's nice to not feel 'on' all of the time..I feel like my nervous system is having a break and my mind isn't so focused, so this is allowing me to stop and smell the roses more.

- I'm less irritable. On Vyvanse, I found myself getting incredibly irritated at any interruption when I was focusing on a task. My partner talking to me, my daughter. I found I just wanted to be left alone and didn't want to talk as much. I was especially bad after the Vyv wore off around 5-6om. Now I'm feeling more myself, talking more and not as cranky.

- I'm feeling more inspired and creative. More like myself..making lists, goal setting..maybe this is also due to being on a break from work so I'm not so stressed. But it's a good thing. 

- I feel like my sense of humour has returned and I'm being more my former silly self again. I was a bit more serious on Vyvanse I guess...

-I'm enjoying food again. I was eating normally after a couple of years on Vyvanse but wasn't really enjoying it like I used to. Now I crave things more and actually savour them...

- I'm not as 'regular'. On Vyv, I used to do my number 2 immediately after my morning coffee. Now it takes a while..and I was extremely constipated after the first week off it. But seems to be settling down.

- Coffee! I can now drink all the coffee I want as couldn't have more than 1-2 cups a day on Vyv as would feel too jittery. So yay for coffee!

So that's it so far. The good and the bad. I will probably go back on it in the new year as feel with my peri meno brain fog I will need it to get through my work week. But I've realised that a break from it was what I needed right now. So hopefully my experience can help you if you're considering a medication break for a period 😀

1. when i was 4 years old my mother got arrested and charged with the rape of two teenage boys, she was their teacher. (one was ‘consensual’ even though a 16 year old boy with a 40 year old woman is disgusting but the other was forced and abused onto him) there was many many many more poor boys she abused throughout her 15 years of teaching but they couldn’t be proven. since i was so little i don’t remember the cops outside and the news reporters like my brother does, i was just really confused. somehow my mother didn’t go to jail for 10 years like she was supposed to (and should’ve) she just got ten years of strict probation and had to go to a mental hospital. from the ages 5-7 my mother was in and out of hospitals leaving little me confused. when she was out i was confused and wondered why i couldn’t do the things the other kids did. like go to the park or have their mom come to school for parties, my parents just said “mommy’s not allowed to go there” i just thought she didn’t like me or something and i felt left out sometimes. for some reason my parents stayed together, they hated each other though and used to fight like crazy. one time my mother even threw hot coffee at him. no one ever bothered to sit down and talk to me about what happened, i always felt like i was left out of some sort of big secret that everyone knew about but me. until i was 10 years old and decided to google my mothers name, i was horrified. i felt like throwing up and i couldn’t believe my eyes, it all sort of made sense though. i told them what i found after i had a panic attack, my mother refused to talk to me about it. my father came outside and only told me “your mother hurt a student” my mother came outside and flipped my father off, i thought this was about me :( it was difficult because i never understood why she would say she loved me so much but she could hurt me and someone else like that. my father used to say bullshit like “your mother was a great teacher” “she touched the lives of many students” oh she touched them alright. and everyone pretended like nothing really happened. 
2. i was bullied like crazy growing up. i lived in like the whitest town ever (like 98 percent) i’m brown and have big curly hair. the bullying was terrible and i was always outcasted and called ghetto, no one would ever hang out with me. everyone would make jokes and treat me like i was some exhibit at the zoo. there was like one other brown girl in my grade and my teachers would always call me by her name even though we looked NOTHING alike
3. i had an eating disorder since i was 10 due to my brother and my mothers eating disorder. they were OBSESSED with calories and food intake, whenever i’d bake something and offer my mother would say “no you eat that it must have a million calories it’ll get me so fat” i started obsessing over my body and would only eat one small meal a day, i would make myself work out even when i was sick and tired
4. my father always used to touch my butt as a child, it makes me uncomfortable. to this day if he sees my butt he slaps it and when ever he comes i will switch from laying on my stomach to my back, this one is definitely a reach though
5. my father uses me as his emotional dumpster, he constantly ridicules me then gets mad when i stay away from him. when i was 12 i told him “when i grow up i hope my kids are like me” and he said to me “oh so you want them to have no drive or motivation whatsoever” i was so upset because that’s really all he though of me? given my situation i NEVER got in trouble at school and was shy but very sweet as a child. when i would distance myself due to him judging my every move he would get mad and say things like “why are you punishing me?” “this is what you wanted though isn’t it? to make me feel like shit?” he would tell me i was being dramatic and tell me “some kids parents beat them up and molest them and YOUR upset?” i was a VERY good child, never talked back, got good grades, and didn’t cause problems. i just stayed to myself and it bothered him? he would complain about my mother and sister to me and make me have to be his emotional support. there’s MANY MANY other examples i could say but literally today my father came in my room to check on me since i’m sick and went to turn on my light and i said “wait wait wait please don’t do that stop it stop stop stop” and he put it half way on and said “calm down u didn’t have to flip out you could’ve just said ‘please don’t do that’ or asked me to put it on halfway or waited till i did” and i said “well how was i supposed to know that until you did” angerly because what the fuck? and then he was like “whatever i just came to check on you” and stormed off and slammed my fucking door. then i heard all this banging and slamming and was genuinely scared, he threw a whole thing of pretzels all over the floor. just because i told him not to turn on the light because it would bother my head.

with all this being said lol ( i’m so sorry it’s so long) i don’t think my childhood was THAT terrible and i have a few happy memories, my father is sometimes nice to me and only started being so cruel since i was like 11, before that he was pretty nice to me. thankyou for reading!",2,1734915231.0,CPTSD,7,1.0,False

1hkc509,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hkc509/how_i_lost_65lbs_in_one_year_and_how_you_can_too/,How I lost 65lbs in one year and how you can too,"Hi Everyone,

I recently joined r/loseit and noticed that many people posting on here seem to be struggling with losing weight and the best way to do so. So I thought I would share my own experience with weight loss and how I went from 215lbs down to 150lbs. Hopefully anyone reading this can hopefully take something positive from it to help them on their weight loss journey.

If your only goal is weight loss and you are not concerned about losing any muscle then this is a good plan to follow.

**Calories**

The first thing you should do when looking to lose weight is figure out what your kcal daily requirements are. Eat less than this and you will lose weight. Click the link to check how many calories you need per day. 

https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html

Find out what your daily maintenance calories are, minus 500 calories from that number so for most people it would be roughly 2000 calories a day. 2000 minus 500 is of course 1500. Doing this should make you lose a pound of fat each week. This is just an example however. Enter your own information to get an accurate number for yourself. Add in cardio which eventually should get to a point when you are burning around 3500 calories a week through cardio alone. 6 cardio sessions a week. Sounds pretty extreme but it’s around 600 calories per cardio session. It’s not that extreme a number. It’s just about building up your fitness to be able to do it consistently over a prolong period of time. That’s 2 pounds of weight loss a week. A pound through your diet and another pound through cardio.

**Diet**

I would recommend a 90/10 split for your diet. As in 90% of your daily diet should be clean calories and around 10% can be junk food. I feel this is the best approach, especially those who struggle with eating clean. The majority of your calories should come from fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Some dairy is ok. What fruit and veg you decide is up to you. Just go for the lowest calorie options generally. Some fruits can be quite high in calories. Watch out for those. Calories in vs calories out is the most important thing. It’s very important you cut out processed food out your diet. Whole grain rice and whole grain pasta are good weight loss options. Sweet potatoes as well. They are high in fibre which helps curb hunger. Don’t skip on the vegetables. At least around 25% of your calories should come from vegetables alone. Get a decent amount of protein as well. Recommended amount for most adults I believe is around 50-60 grams a day. Aim for that.

**Intermittent Fasting**

First thing in the morning have only black coffee. Have a few cups if you like. You will need the caffeine for your cardio sessions. It basically has no calories. Do your cardio. After your cardio I recommend decaf coffee. It helps curb your appetite. I also recommend intermittent fasting. 16/8. 16 hour fast. 8 hours eating period. It might sound difficult but it’s really not. Your body will adapt. I can now go around 8-10 hours after waking up before I start feeling hungry. Start the fast after your last meal at night. Go sleep. By the time you wake up it should be around 8-9 hours already passed by. Have your coffee then cardio in the gym. By then you should probably have another few hours to go. Just drink lots of water and have some coffee/decaf coffee. Basically any low calorie drink. Even diet soda since it has no calories. The weight will begin flying off.

**Cardio**

I already touched on cardio earlier but will go into more detail now. Cardio is really important for weight loss. If your only goal is weight loss and not concerned about losing muscle then just stick to cardio. Lifting weights isn’t necessary. Build up your fitness levels. Start off with long slower cardio sessions eventually it should get to a point when it’s a mixture of liss and hiit cardio as each type of cardio offers different benefits. After each cardio session your shirt should be drenched in sweat once your fitness levels allow it. Aim to
burn at least around 500-600 calories per cardio session. 5-6 days a week. Challenge yourself with each cardio session. Don’t slack off. Listen to your body however. If you feel you need a break take it. Don’t risk overtraining.

Hopefully there is enough information here to get you started or increase your knowledge of weight loss and given you new ideas. The point I was trying to make here is that weight loss is super simple. Its really about finding the motivation to stick to a diet/training plan long term because it can be difficult. It’s why I recommend a 90/10 diet. You can still have a daily treat. Just in moderation. Why most diets fail is because people don’t enjoy them. Finding a healthy low calorie diet you actually look forward to is the secret to weight loss success. In a months time of following this advice you should definitely start noticing a difference in your body.

Any questions please ask🙂

1hkc4jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiceGirls/comments/1hkc4jl/forever_era/,Forever Era ,"It’s no secret the Forever album plummeted and led to their hiatus. However what was most shocking to me looking back is how lazy the promotion was especially in the USA (where I’m from). 

The album debuted and peaked at #38 before completely falling out of the charts even before Christmas. 

To this day it doesn’t even have a gold certification (500k in album sales is gold in the USA). It’s shifted 275k-300k as of 2024. America had to literally ship back copies to UK Virgin records it was that underwhelming and clogging record stores despite already being discounted before Black Friday (Americas version of Boxing Day). Their greatest hits album sold more and is platinum in this country. None of the girls solo careers ever took off in America. Geri’s debut album did become certified gold. However that was a slow burn. That’s the only solo Spice album or single to be certified anything in America. Not even Mel C’s single with Left-Eye made an impression on the US charts and TLC was selling out arenas and all over the charts. 

What they should’ve done, is broadcast the Christmas in Spice World Tour on broadcast TV. It was broadcasted in multiple Countries but not the US. By this point the Spice Girls still had some steam left in America. Goodbye did peak at #11 the year before which was a higher peak than Spice Up Your Life, Stop, or Viva Forever. However “Tour Story: Spice Girls in America” wasn’t even released in America. 

They should’ve broadcasted the Christmas tour in America, released that documentary that is about their time in America, in actual America on VHS, released the Forever Spice coffee table book in America, and have done something other than release a couple more doll lines in ‘99 in America. 

They still had momentum in December of ‘99. But by that point, Britney and Christina were dominating the “girl pop” charts. According to reports they were shocked about how badly Forever bombed in America which aside from other parts of Europe, America was their biggest export. However by November 2000, we moved on. With a fanbase of 5-15 year olds they aren’t going to wait around forever (no pun intended). Americans didn’t hear anything from them in two years, so obviously the kids moved on.
