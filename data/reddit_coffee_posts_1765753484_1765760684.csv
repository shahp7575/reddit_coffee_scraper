It's just a fun little treat to get for your dog when they're out and about, or to give your dog at home. 

The thing is, most whipped cream isn't vegan. And I know you can buy vegan versions, but what else is the equivalent of a pup cup for vegan dogs? I was thinking maybe a spoonful of peanut butter (obviously salt- and xylitol-free), but would love to hear any other suggestions. An applesauce cup, maybe? ",0,1765760360.0,vegan,1,0.5,False

I've never written a novel before (you can probably tell). Thanks!","Something was crawling under his skin—or at least he hoped so.

There were times when Scott would look at his dark olive hands—tendons pulled tight over his knuckles—and see them as fragile.

It didn't matter how tough they were, or how much wear they'd seen; every little scar carried a lesson that he hated to cherish.

Thin lines of red were still visible at the base of his fingernails; days had passed since he was shot, but this new job was a little more important than hygiene.

Scott tightened his grip on the wheel.

Each bump in the road made the AC jitter under the hood—buzzing like a wasp caught in a vacuum hose. Seasonal and evergreen trees stood tall on either side, guiding traffic further into the mountains. Gray skies hung above with clouds clinging to the snowy peaks.

His chosen steed, a black shelled truck, barreled up the highway. Scott kept checking the mud-spattered mirrors; front, back, side to side, even the blind spots.

A cold, dense humidity lingered in the cab, enough to quench his thirst if he breathed hard. Highway 2 was packed; the cars ahead plowed through old puddles, kicking up a dark mist that spattered across his windshield. Scott squinted as the wipers flew by, giving him a moment of clarity before the next splash.

Big, bulky hands rubbed hard against his jaw, scratching at the thin stubble that grew in dark patches. Deep brown eyes drifted down to the scuffed-up dashboard and car radio. The time was displayed in a sickly green light—3:00 P.M.

“Making good time,” Scott mumbled, his voice gruff yet quiet. “They're really haulin’ it, huh?”

Nothing. She must be reading.

Scott rolled his shoulders back with a sigh, tapping a forefinger against the steering wheel. The gas and brake played tug of war as the mountain traffic wound through sharp turns.

“...Red.” He frowned. “Come on, don't leave me hanging.”

**“I'm multitasking.”**

Scott snorted, a brief smirk hidden by the stubble. He reached over to the empty passenger seat and grabbed a thermos rolling around—the only real cup holder being occupied by a loaded pistol—and cracked it open with one hand.

**“Are you bored?”**

“I'm tired.” The man grunted and took a swig of black coffee, which had long gone cold. “Sun's setting soon—humor me for a bit.”

**“If you insist. Should I hit you with one-tenth percent?”**

“Oh, no, no. Please don't.” Scott chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck as he rechecked the rearview mirror. More traffic followed close behind, headlights blurred by the mist.

A typical divider with a tiny window separated the cab and shell, the latter stuffed to the gills with large, black duffel bags. Scott had memorized the contents of each one—canned food, water bottles, camping gear, winter coats, towels, children’s clothes, bogus license plates, and ammunition, the list went on.

Before turning back to the road, Scott’s dark eyes lingered on the backseat. Every seat was dark gray, sparse, and tidy compared to the clutter in the back. 

A small booster seat was strapped into the passenger-side back seat. It was empty.

1pmu5j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pmu5j3/aio_or_is_this_conduct_a_mentalbehavioral/,AIO or is this conduct a mental/behavioral condition or am I just being sensitive?,"So in recent years, recognizing and handling mental and emotional health has become very important at my place of employment.  It is a high stress-high reward environment, so as executive management we have been taking classes and furthering our education to be supportive to our staff/teams.  Because of this... I (42f) tend to be more cognizant of certain behaviors that I didn't really notice as mental health or emotional health issues.  

In any event, my parents are having some work done in their condo, so they've been staying with us since Thanksgiving. (YES - since THANKSGIVING 😵🔫)  My mom has this very ""pick me"" girl way of acting (I think that is self explanatory), and also does this thing that I am certain is some form of weird manipulation.  

A few examples - I've made dinner and she says she will clean up.  45 minutes after we've all left the table - leftovers are still sitting out, table hasn't been cleared, not a thing has been started.  I love my home, and hate waste, so I will get frustrated and start to clean, followed by her saying ""I was gonna clean, I can help, I can help..."" but she continues to sit and not move. My PERSONAL fave: when her coffee cup/water glass is empty, she will forcefully slam her glass down, and pops will immediately ask if she would like some more.  Of course she does. 🙄She has pulled this type of BS for decades with my dad.  ""OH, I left my charger in the car.  I guess I better get it..."" long pause, long stares at pops and then he says, ""I'll get it..."" jumps up and walks out the door.   Most people would not announce that they would help - they would just get up and start cleaning, or get up and on the way out of the room say, ""I'm gonna grab my charger.  Be right back,"" or something similar- yes?  

This and that must be done, and she's going to do it, but waits until someone else starts and then kind of sighs and says, ""I was going to do it, but oh well."" Whereas, wouldn't most people just get up and help once they've volunteered to do something or grab something they need? What bothers me is that it is always followed by the fake ""I was going to do that.""  ""I can get around and go get it."" ""I don't need more, but if you want to get me some sure.""  She avoids asking for help, or avoids moving her ass, AND manages to avoid to having say ""thanks."" 

Idk...maybe I am the one with emotional health issues, but it being in my face all day, everyday I am about to explode.  She better be happy I run everyday - the stress relief keeps her safe. 😅😅  Am I overreacting that she's manipulative...and if not - how do I address it with her? 

Side note: she is perfectly able bodied and able to get around.  She's in her 60s...not 80s, 90s. Nothing physically prohibiting her other than laziness IMO. ",1,1765760046.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

These are legit skill based games where you’re playing other people and can cash out fast if you win.

I’m decent at strategy and puzzle games, so I usually start with a small amount like $5 and see how far I can run it up. Worst case, you skip a couple coffees that week.

Here are the ones that actually pay real money:

[• Blitz Win Cash](https://www.pubtrack.co/cmp/2J7JPH/BNMQL7/?sub1=reddit) – This one’s underrated. Fast matches, skill based, and payouts can hit Cash App or PayPal pretty quickly once you withdraw. Good if you like quick games and don’t want to wait days.

[• Bingo Cash](https://www.pubtrack.co/cmp/2J7JPH/5QBKQN/?sub1=reddit) – Probably the most popular. Real tournaments, real people, and instant withdrawals once you’re verified. If you’re good at bingo and pattern spotting, it’s solid.

[• Solitaire Cash](https://www.pubtrack.co/cmp/2J7JPH/5MSRPQ/?sub1=ss) – Straightforward. If you’re good at solitaire, you can actually make a few bucks here. Same deal with fast cashouts.

Important notes so people don’t get burned:  
– These are skill games, not free money  
– Start small until you know the game  
– Cash App availability can vary by state  
– If you lose control easily, this isn’t for you

If you’re already scrolling on your phone anyway, these can be a decent way to turn downtime into a little extra cash. Happy to answer questions if anyone’s curious.",1,1765759858.0,EarnExtraIncome,0,1.0,False

Context:
My ex (M, early 20s) and I (F, early 20s) broke up about a month and a half ago after a significant and healthy relationship. The reason for the breakup was that he wasn't sure about his feelings for me anymore. It was a clean break, but we mutually decided to stay in touch because we still care about each other deeply and nothing bad happened between us (no cheating, no toxic fights).
Even though the official breakup was a month and a half ago, we had both already mentally ""checked out"" of the relationship a few weeks before calling it quits (him more than me). 

Post-Breakup:
Despite his decision to end it, we’ve texted and met up for coffee as friends. We had a deep conversation where we both admitted that when we think about a long-term partner, we still think of each other. However, he stands firm on his decision to end things for now. I respect his choice, but I can’t deny that I hope our paths will cross again in the future.

Current Situation:
A few weeks ago, I started seeing another guy. It’s not serious, and we made that clear from the start, but we get along really well. It’s not just a desperate ""rebound"" to fill a void; it’s a genuine, lighthearted connection that happened because, as I mentioned, I had already started processing the detachment before the official end.
That being said, I want to be honest: I have struggled with a lot of guilt regarding this new situation for quite a while, even though I know I'm technically single.
The problem is, by some unlucky coincidence, this guy and my ex have started hanging out in the exact same social circle right now.

(To clarify: my ex and this guy don’t actually know each other yet. My ex is only now starting to enter this social circle through his best friend, which is why the overlap is just happening.)

We wanted to keep our situation on the down-low to avoid awkwardness and gossip, but the guy I’m seeing let the truth slip to an acquaintance in the group.
The dynamic is risky: this acquaintance isn't close friends with my ex directly, but he is close friends with my ex’s best friend. So, it’s basically guaranteed that word will get back to my ex very soon.
Realizing his mistake, the guy I’m seeing emphatically told this acquaintance to keep the info to himself, but I’m afraid it won’t be enough.

My Fears:
1. I’m afraid my ex will find out through the grapevine and, knowing it’s someone he’ll be seeing in his group, he might take it really badly.
2. I’m terrified he’ll think I replaced him immediately and that this will permanently burn any bridges for a future reconciliation, which is something I still care about deeply.
3. I am extremely worried about how he will interpret the timeline. We were together for a year and a half, and it has only been a month and a half since we broke up. I don't know what he will think about me dating someone else so soon compared to the length of our relationship.

How do you think this will be perceived? Did I mess up by dating someone ""close"" to him, or am I just being paranoid about this ruining our future chances?

Im starting to get very annoyed /frustrated. Any advice on where to go from here?","My husband and I have been together for 13 years, and have has our fair share of ups and downs. We really love each other at the end of the day and our relationship over the years has been the easiest and best thing in my life. I feel like after being in a relationship this long he should know how I feel about certain things and vice versa. 

As many couples do our arguments come down to doing household chores. I am definitely not the tidyest person, and am not very fussy when it comes down to having the house look perfect. What I do like and expect for things to be liveable. For example, I don't care if after we eat dinner that our plates are left on the coffee table overnight because we were watching a movie and were to tired to put them away. But if we were having dinner and finished and he stands up to clear his plate and ""put it away"" he will just leave it in the sink with leftover food still on it and think this is a job well done. 

I have spoken with him regarding this many times about how it is stressful for me to have things done only part way or claim that he doesn't know how I want it. I will tell him Im irritated because I have come home from being away for a week (I travel often for work) and the dishwasher is still full of clean dishes that I put in before I left and the kitchen is unusable because he has left his cooking mess all over it, dishes piled up in the sink ect. I have approached this several different ways and let him know my thoughts and feelings. It feels like each time we talk about it or he sees that I am frustrated with him he will do the house chores and expect a pat on the back. But then a few weeks will pass, he won't do anything about it and they cycle will start all over again. 

I don't feel like I am asking a lot here, just to pull his weight in the house we are living in together. I would say he does most of the cooking/ regularly groceries shopping, but I do an overwhelming majority of the other household chores (vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, laundry, ensuring the household items are stocked with toothpaste shampoo ect, pet chores,) along with a lot of the mental chores like paying bills, taking the pets to the vet, organizing our social lives, booking appointments.

Most of these apps let you start with around $5 and just see how far you can rack it up. I treat it like skipping a coffee for the week and seeing what happens. Worst case you lose a latte. Best case you turn it into actual cash.

One I’ve personally used is [Blitz Win Cash](https://www.pubtrack.co/cmp/2J7JPH/BNMQL7/?__efq=UYi0EaP4GC0). It’s quick games and tournaments where skill actually matters, not slots or casino junk. If you’re decent at games like chess, puzzles, cards, or trivia, you at least have a fighting chance.

When I texted to let the hosts know I wasn't going to be able to make it, I told them what was up and that I'd just started tirz. I didn't tell anyone else, nor did I tell my husband he could tell anyone else. 

I'm really upset because one of the women he told at the party has been a cudgel in our marriage — telling him not to marry me because it was too soon, not wanting to see ultrasound pics of our kids. It's been challenging and messy. There's been a lot of jealousy, anger, and upset about her over the years as I raise our two very young children and she gets to be in her successful creative career. They have a great relationship, however, and I \*really\* don't want to alienate my husband from his friends. I'm trying my best to build a good relationship with her by making plans to get coffee, bringing over dinner when she is sick, and being supportive of her artistic work. 

All this to say, taking this medication is COMPLICATED for me, and there's a lot of conflict in our far-left community about the implications of GLP-1 drugs. I wish I were tough enough to say, ""F\*ck it."" Instead, I am really upset with my husband for not letting me talk about it myself with the people I choose to. Am I overreacting here?

If you’re looking to make some easy side money, I’ve been using AttaPoll for a while now. It’s basically an app where you earn by doing small surveys, simple tasks and even some games. Nothing fancy, but it’s legit and payouts are real.

I usually do a few surveys when I’m free or just bored, and it adds up slowly. Not a get-rich thing obviously, but good for coffee money or small expenses.

Theres a lot of history and culture, amazing food and AMAZING people. But the “niceties” and accommodations. The Champa ruins are a must to visit, just please remember to be respectful of the grounds. 

The food is on another level in Viet Nam. Fresh, natural, light, portioned, and flavorful. I have bad acid reflux, but not in Viet Nam. I can only assume the diet plays a factor. 

The coffee, what Viet Nam is known for, is incredible. Every shop serves cafe su da, but theyre all somehow different. also a must. 

The beaches are out of this world, and stretches as far as you can see. fine powder-like sand, warm tropical water, amazing view of the sunrise/set. simply amazing.

1pmtt6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pmtt6b/27m_caught_in_a_hell_loop_about_pain_au_chocolate/,"(27M) Caught in a Hell loop about Pain Au Chocolate 🥐🍫 by my (26F) partner. How can I stop the story from getting taller, and constantly repeating?!","TL;DR: this is going to sound minor or goofy, but every time she tells this “silly” story it gets a bit taller, and paints me as a worse person.

I have told her how it makes me feel, and she says she won’t keep beating me like a dead horse… but “forgets”. It has been going on for two years now…

Any tips on how to stop this Hell loop?

.

.

Summary Question: I feel like I don’t have the tools in my tool kit to deal with this. And I am hoping that you might be able to lend advice or experience.

I have tried listening and apologizing, another time changing the conversation topic to refocus or another time being playful trying “tease” her back about the situation; but it is not well received.

So this is just a gentlemen who does enjoy pastries, 🥐 and also ice cream. 🍨 But is very must not enjoying this hell loop. 🙃

.

.

Full Story: when we were first dating she picked me up at the airport. I was expecting just a curb side pick up, but to my surprise I heard my name when I was standing at the baggage claim, and behind me was this gorgeous woman in a super cute outfit holding fresh pain au chocolates. 🥐🍫

I also felt so caught off guard, I was expecting to take her out somewhere for cafe after she picked me up. I did not bring her a gift to reciprocate… I should’ve gotten flowers or her favourite coffee order 🙃

She gives me a big hug, and then shoves a couple of pastries towards me. They looked delicious, but also extremely fluffy and flakey; perfect qualities for enjoyment… but not for eating in the middle of an airport, with no napkins.

I come from a fairly neat and tidy up brining and culture. So the idea of eating them right then and there and making a huge mess both on my own clothes and in a public space with no way to clean it up… certainly appalled me 😅 and from her reaction I guess that was plain as day on my face 🙃

She mood immediately changed, and she said something to the effect of “oh you don’t like pastries?!”. And I replied something along the lines of “I do, but can we eat them later?” Then I saw my bag come out, and had to retrieve it.

We caught the train over to where she had parked, the air being a bit tense. She kept apologizing, and I kept insuring they looked delicious and I was looking forward to sharing them. She insisted the flakey pastries were ok to eat in her car, and it was alright to make a mess with delicious flakes and melted chocolate, as she drove me back to her flat.

She kept insisting that I must not have liked them, and that she should have gotten me something else. I kept trying to reassure her that I did like the pastries, but I felt uncomfortable making a mess and also eating on my own in-front of her, instead of enjoying the pastries together.

She would not take yes for an answer, that I liked pastries and that the pain do chocolates were good, they were delicious btw. And then she started a different approach asking about what foods or treats I might like better. I tried to keep insisting that I liked the pastries and they were great and a super sweet gift. But eventually I caved and said that I also liked ice cream, and suggested that I get us some. I was hoping that would help re aim the conversation 😅

Anyways, fast forward to modern day. It has now been years and every time I suggest we get pastries, or we go out to a bakery or cafe with friends she retells the story from her point of view and “teases” me for hating bread and pastries. But the story keeps getting shorter in length and taller in facts.

Today we were discussing Christmas gifts, and I know she has been wanting a stand up mixer or bread box for baking. But I wanted her input on which one would be best, as I know they are a very personal thing. She was asking what she could get me in return. I suggested maybe the new chip I have been looking at for a home project, but it was a bit expensive (around the same price as the mixer she had picked out for me to purchase). And se noted how expensive it was.

So I suggested maybe she could purchase the ingredients and we could bake some breads together over the holidays for my gift. I am not a very consumerist person, my main love languages is quality time, and I know how expensive the holiday season can be.

Instead the conversation suddenly shifts with “You don’t even like bread tho I can’t just give you bread for Christmas”

and I get another 20 minute hell loop of being retold the same story but this time shortened “I’m sure he’ll love these!”, “Oh how am I supposed to eat it here?” and “I like ice cream better”.

While also getting taller and more emphasis with statements like “The heartbreak I felt when you said you like ice cream is a heartbreak I’ll remember until we’re dead”.

Please help, how can I stop this Hell loop… I tried to explain once again how this makes me feel to her. And she apologizes and says she won’t do it again. But she also said the same thing last week, and last month, and before that. But keeps “forgetting”.

I feel like I don’t have the tools in my tool kit to deal with this. I have tried changing the conversation topic to refocus or being playful trying “tease” her back about the situation but it is not well received.

So this is just a gentlemen who does enjoy pastries, and also ice cream. But is very must not enjoying this hell loop.",1,1765759066.0,relationships,5,0.67,False

1pmtsem,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1pmtsem/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_alexa/,I'm at the end of my rope with Alexa.,"I need to rant. I'm convinced Alexa is getting dumber, every single day. And I'm about to throw them all out and never get an Alexa again.

I have routines set because my workplace will call me to say that the workday is starting at a later time, especially in winter with bad road conditions. Usually I get these calls at four or five in the morning, and I don't want to have to fiddle with turning off every single alarm and routine that I have set, so have a routine to do it for me.

I've had these routines since around 2022 and they have stayed exactly the same with the same devices,  same times, and same alarms since then. However, in the last year or so, these routines have stopped working.

The routine basically does as follows:
-turns off the alarm to wake me up.
-turns off my routine for my workday morning (including turning on lights, starting the coffee pot, etc.) 
-sets a new alarm for a later time
-gives me a reminder of what time to leave with the later start time.

First command: ""turn off the six fifteen AM alarm on the bedroom echo.""

She responds, ""did you mean the bedroom echo, the bathroom echo or the living room echo?""

Just to figure it out, I tried asking her this by itself. She responds the same way, and then I asked, ""what did I just say?"" She says, ""I heard turn off the six fifteen AM alarm on the bedroom echo.""

Okay???? So what's the problem????

Problem number one with this is that the routine is typed out. I typed in the app: Turn off the 6:15 AM alarm on the bedroom echo, so why is it asking for a clarification?
Problem number two is that I had to change this command because it did not like me saying, ""turn off all alarms"" or ""turn off all alarms on the bedroom echo,"" She would respond with the whole ""there are no alarms set on this device, but there is an alarm set on the bedroom echo. Would you like to turn this off?"" followed then by, ""would you like to cancel this alarm off for every weekday?"" Or whatever it is that she says. 

The main problem with this is that it is integrated into a routine, so it interrupts itself to move on to the next step in the routine, therefore making it do nothing that was asked of it. It doesn't get an answer in time before it moves on to the next step of the routine. And I don't want to add in ""wait"" times between the steps, because again, the whole... point... here is to automate having to turn off everything in the app at 4 in the morning. I just need it to cancel things, set a new alarm reliably, so I can go back to sleep!

Mind you, I have had this routine on these devices since 2022 and they have worked without issue until recently, like within the last year. 

That's not even getting started on all the other things that it suddenly has problems doing that it used to never have any problems doing. It fails to do a very simple task. I have to ask it the exact same thing twice or three time just for her to do it (either ""hmm I'm not sure about that"" or she just... does nothing, but after the second or third time saying the same thing, she suddenly works.)

And then, to add insult to injury, follows up with ""by the way, I have a new voice with Alexa plus, would you like to try it out?"" Even though I have ""by the way"" turned off, I ask her to turn off ""by the way"" every time she says it, and that's even if I can manage to interrupt her to ask her to stop, because sometimes she just ignores me to continue her company mandated sales pitch.

I'm ready to set fire to all of these devices, throw them in the garbage and trade them out for literally any other smart home device. You shouldn't need a paid subscription service for the device to even work. Fuck that.

In the few months I had been in Bonifacio Grove, I had barely filled my room with the detritus of daily life. That made it easy to pack everything I owned back into my two suitcases and lug those into the hallway. I nearly bumped into Elise as I descended the stairs; she squeaked and scurried back from our almost-collision, clutching the strap of her duffel bag tight as she did.

Her terrified eyes lifted to mine. I glanced at her luggage and nodded in silent understanding. There was nothing to be gained from us staying in a house that regurgitated corpse heads up its sink.

The first floor was a chaotic chorus: Charles and Leo cursed as they gathered their own things, Sam was on the landline calling the cops, Anika shouted prayers and rebukes in the kitchen—Dominic watched her from the hallway, arms crossed and a frown set deep on his face. He turned as Elise and I passed him. “Where are you two going?”

“Out,” I said. “We’re leaving.”

*“Wait!”* Charles yelped as he dashed out his unit, a bag in tow. Leo tripped into the open right after him. “I’m going with you, I’m not staying here.”

I nodded—it was good to see that everyone was keeping their common sense about them—then turned to Dominic: “You coming with?”

Dominic glowered. “All my money went into rent, I can’t afford to go anywhere right now.”

My earlier irritation returned—just briefly, before I clicked my tongue and forced myself to relax. If I let my frustration get the best of me, I’d be no better than Dominic and his caustic temperament. “I’ll pay for it. Get your stuff.”

The man blinked, then grinned and bolted to his room.

“Anika, Sam!” I called out. “Let’s go.”

*“I rebuke the spirit that has come upon the house!”* Anika shouted back instead. *“For I have been given the power to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to overcome the enemy. I won’t let this mockery of my faith drive me out.”*

I paused in surprise. Charles dragged a hand over his face. “Let’s just *go,* man, religious nuts like her never listen to people.”

“But—”

“We need to *get out of here.”* He grabbed my sleeve. “We don’t know when the next freaky thing is gonna happen—do you really want to risk being here a second longer than we have to?”

My mouth pinched. I didn’t know my housemates that well, so I hadn’t considered one of us would deliberately stay in a situation like this. Ideally, all of us should leave, but Charles was right. We didn’t have the time to convince Anika when things could get worse any second.

I swallowed my trepidation and headed for the living room. “Sam?”

Sam looked up from where he was bowed over the landline, one hand holding the phone to his ear, the other fidgeting with the cord. He smiled uneasily and pressed the phone to his shoulder so it wouldn’t pick up his voice. “I’m just calling people to sort this out,” he said; a strange thing to say, I hadn’t asked for justifications on what he was doing. Maybe it was a habit of his, to constantly explain himself. “I don’t think it’s anything supernatural, I think it’s just…”

“A fucking head appeared in our sink, man!” Leo sprinted to my side. “How the hell do you think that got there? You think it just got swept up the drain?”

Sam’s smiled faltered. His knuckles bleached white as his grip on the phone and cord tightened.

“It looks—” Leo choked up. “It looks like my dead brother…you can’t explain that—”

“No, it’s doesn’t,” Dominic cut in as he emerged from his room, backpack in hand. “It…” He clenched his jaw, hard enough that I could see the veins on his throat. He looked away and put a hand over his mouth. “It looks like my dad.”

“No?” Leo frowned. “It’s a kid’s head. How the hell does it look like your dad?”

“What are you two *talking about?”* Sam asked this time, eyes blown wide. His stare was on me, but it was glazed, distant. “It doesn’t look like some grown man, that’s my little cousin.”

…something was wrong. I turned to Elise, who stood at the end of the hallway and was twisting the hem of her sweater. She sported Dominic’s same queasy look, trembling so hard she looked like she was going to collapse at any moment.

“Elise,” I called gently. “What…what do you see in the sink?”

She drew her shoulders up. Bracing, I realized, much like I did whenever I expected to get hit. “…my mother,” she said. “What…what do *you* see?”

My lips flattened to a thin line. Then, after a moment: “My little sister.”

My dead little sister, who passed years and years ago and had to have a closed casket funeral, and who apparently appeared as other people to my housemates. Maybe it wasn’t her haunting me then, maybe this was something else, something that exhumed things from the depths of our pasts, things that made us pale and tremble and shake and look like we were about to be sick.

The realization seemed to hit the others at the same time it did me. Charles swore under his breath. Dominic ran a hand through his hair and hissed: “Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.”

“We *have* to get out of here,” Leo hissed, then turned to Sam. *“Now.”*

This time, the man didn’t protest. He put the phone down and nodded.

All six of us left the house and headed for the bus stop. All the streetlights surrounding the tiny shed were busted, and the nearby bakery was closed, so we had to turn on our phones’ flashlights to find our seats.

I sagged into the plastic chair as soon as I sat down. Despite my relative levelheadedness in leading the others out, there was still a weight between my eyes and a woozy, light-headed quality to my awareness. Now that the adrenaline was dying down, the discomfort shoved itself to the forefront of my mind. I hung my head between my knees.

At least the road was void of screeching cars. Nothing to worsen my headache. The lack of traffic was unusual for Manila—the city was even more congested than Cebu—but Bonifacio Grove’s highway had always been strangely barren. The only vehicles I had ever seen pass were the scheduled public transport. Most of the time, the street was abandoned.

“Ryan.” Elise shook my shoulder. “The bus is here.”

I looked up. Pale blue light washed over us as the bus doors hissed open. I squinted at the sudden brightness.

The six of us got up and boarded, with me climbing dead last. The bus was completely empty, so the others fanned out and grabbed seats at their leisure, not bothering to stick close—save for Elise, who snatched my arm and turned me around so I was facing her.

She motioned to her forehead. “Did you hit your head somewhere?”

I blinked. “What?”

“You’re bleeding.”

I reached up. My hand caught something sticky, warm, and wet between my eyes. When I pulled it back, my fingertips were stained.

In the bus interior’s sickly blue light, my blood looked black. I shakily scrubbed the rest of it off my brow, and wiped my hands clean on my jeans.

“It’s fine,” I lied. “I must have hit my head somewhere on our way out. We were in a hurry.”



\-



The rain came shortly after the bus began its lonely glide out of Bonifacio Grove’s neighborhood. Since I sat at a window seat at the very back, I pulled my window closed before I could get drenched by the downpour. The others sitting scattered rows away from me did the same to theirs; Sam stood and closed the rest of the unused windows.

“What do you think it is?” Charles suddenly asked. Even with the white noise of the rainfall outside, his voice easily carried in the empty bus.

“What, the storm or something?” Sam asked as he returned to his seat. “It always rains here.”

“No, I meant…” I could only see the back of Charles’ head, but the slight crack in his voice gave away his fear. “The thing. In the sink. What do you think it is?”

For a minute or so, we only had the storm to fill the quiet. Then, Dominic huffed. “Some haunted bullshit.”

“Why do we all see different things, then?” Leo, sitting up front, angled his body so he was facing the rest of us. “I mean, Ryan’s seeing his sister, Sam’s seeing his cousin…if it was a ghost, you’d think we’d all see the same thing, ‘cause it’s stuck there and haunting the place.”

“What, you suddenly an expert on hauntings, now?” Dominic crossed his arms. “Didn’t know there was a canonized body of knowledge for the supernatural.”

Leo opened his mouth, paused, then tilted his head in a *Yeah, you have a point* gesture, and nodded in acquiescence.

“Us seeing different things’s probably got something to do with it, though, right? Whatever’s going on in that house.” Charles ducked his head and rubbed his nape. “Then again, we’ve got no idea what the hell was going on in there, anyway.”

“Maybe something’s tying them together, all the people we’re seeing.” Sam similarly turned in his seat to face everyone else. He had that empty, but friendly smile on his face again. That seemed to be his default state, constantly trying to look as harmless as possible. “Something they all have in common that…whatever’s happening is making them appear to us.”

Another awkward silence in the bus.

Dominic shifted in his seat. My, uh. My old man kicked the bucket last year.” A pause. “Had a stroke and fell off the balcony. Leo mentioned that his brother was dead too, so maybe that’s—you know.” He clicked his tongue, then slid his attention to Leo like he was waiting for him to back up that statement up.

“…my brother got shot when we were in high school,” Leo admitted, shoulders hiking up. “The cops were doing a drug raid around the neighborhood, and he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. They thought he was involved, tried to arrest him; he ran and…”

He trailed off and stayed quiet. Dominic grunted and turned to the rest of us, stare landing on me, then Elise, then Sam. It stayed there, and Sam’s smile twitched to something tense, before it wilted completely.

“It was an accident,” he said. “We were just kids. Her mom had to run back to the store real quick and told us to wait outside. This van suddenly swerved into the sidewalk and I got scared and jumped away, forgot to grab her with me ‘cause I got startled.”

My stomach dropped. Even before Elise said her piece, I already knew the image of her haunting would already be dead as well. I searched for where she sat ahead of me, and when our gazes met, her shoulders slumped. She wiped her eyes with the heel of her palm. “My mom died of lung cancer.”

“…my little sister passed too,” I said, quietly. “When our town got hit with a bad storm.”

“So we’re all seeing dead people.” Dominic nodded with another grunt and turned to our last member. “What’d you see, Charles? You didn’t mention it back at the house.”

In the brief moment I’d listened to the others, I’d looked away from Charles. His back was still to me, so I couldn’t see his face, but I could hear his quick and shallow breaths over the sound of the rain, and see the violent trembling of his shoulders.

Sam got up and approached him. “You alright, man?”

He made a noise, as if attempting to answer but failing miserably to do anything but croak out something strangled. His hands leapt and grabbed the back of the seat in front of him, nails digging into the foam.

*“Me,”* he wheezed out, after a long, shaking moment. “Me, I saw *me.* My dead face.”

He swayed to his feet—to do what, I didn’t know—but lost balance and listed sideways into the wall. His shoulder hit the metal surface, but he didn’t even grunt in pain.

“I’m *alive,”* he said, curling into himself like a dying insect. “I’m alive, I didn’t die in…in some horrible storm, or an accident, or got sick or…”

He straightened abruptly, then looked at each of us with a feverish terror in his eyes. “I’m alive—right?” he asked. The desperation in his voice made my own hands shake. “I’m not dead. This isn’t some fucked up afterlife I’m imagining. *Right?”*

“Of course.” Sam slowly neared him, hands held up. When Charles didn’t react, he placed his palms on the man’s shoulders and guided him back to his seat. “Of course you’re alive, Charles. Otherwise, we’d all be dead too.”

I swallowed and dug my nails into the meat of my hands. The cut of keratin against flesh hurt—as it should, because I was alive, I was real, I wasn’t some ghost blindly wandering, dreaming that it was still alive.



\-



The others and I stopped by five inns before we found one with a vacancy. A singular one with two beds, but nobody protested when I suggested we all sleep at whatever spot we could snag. Even Dominic just grunted and followed everyone to the room.

Elise claimed the bed closest to the door, while Dominic claimed the other. Leo shot him a side-eye, but shook his head and picked a corner to place his luggage in. Sam and Charles chose random spots to sit on and stretch their legs. I nudged the door shut with my foot and—

—looked up to find myself back in the Bonifacio Grove’s living room. The corner where Leo put his things in was now the corner where the shelves met at an angle. Sam and Charles sat on liquor brown floorboards instead of the inn’s teal vinyl floormat. Elise laid on one of the couches while Dominic laid on another.

*“Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us,”* Anika’s voice droned from the kitchen. *“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”*

In my periphery, Elise brought a hand to her mouth to muffle a sob.

*“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory…”*



\-



We marched out of the house to find someplace else to stay three more times. Each time, we reached an inn, got a room, piled inside—and the moment the door closed behind us, we were back in Bonifacio Grove. After the third time, none of us bothered to pick up our luggage. Instead, we all sat on the couches and exhaustedly spaced out. I picked a window to target my thousand-yard stare at.

I was halfway asleep when Anika ceased praying in the kitchen and graced the doorway. “The cops came by earlier to check Sam’s call. I pointed them to the sink.” Her lips pursed. “They couldn’t see the head.”

…shit. I tiredly turned to properly look at her. She had her arms crossed and her eyes narrowed at the floor.

“They couldn’t see anything at all. They yelled at me for calling them about an empty sink.” She dragged her glare back up at each of us. “I had to suffer through that since you were all afraid. It’s just demons playing tricks on us. Nothing to be scared of when you have faith.”

I’ve never been a religious man. That was more of my mother’s thing. She went to church every Sunday, brought her tithes, sat in Bible studies, and volunteered in outreach ministries. The night the doctor told her my father’s kidneys had failed and it wouldn’t be long until he died, she sat by his hospital bed and prayed for his miraculous healing until morning. The next day, she went home for an hour to rest, then returned and prayed some more.

*“It is moments like these when it is crucial that we have faith,”* she told me.

The day after that, Father died. She cried harder than I had ever seen her, harder than when Father beat her so bad she couldn’t see out of her left eye for weeks. I couldn’t tell if her grief was because her husband had died or because God didn’t answer her.

“I’m going to call my pastor tomorrow,” Anika said. “This isn’t something that can be solved by leaving the house or calling the cops. This is spiritual warfare.”

“Will he be able to help?” Leo croaked out; he was sprawled over one of the single-seaters, arm slung over his eyes. “Can he do an exorcism or something?”

Anika scowled. “Don’t mock the children of God, Leo.”

“I wasn’t…” The rest of Leo’s defense sank into the muddy fog of my fatigue. The world faded, the lights dimmed, sound vanished as sleep pulled me under and left me dead to the world.

I awoke in the middle of an empty, run-down church. A dusty, broken altar stood up ahead; faded stained glass windows loomed tall behind it—the sunset streaming through them painted the church interior in fiery swaths of red.

At the front, Eyeless Mary twirled and danced. The light above her stained the pale colors of her robes scarlet. “Ryan.” She smiled. “Dance with me, will you?”

I scrambled away from the illuminated parts of the floor, shoes skidding and squeaking from how fast I backed into the shadows. I was glad for their unnatural darkness for once. The moment I stepped into them, I lost sight of my own hands, my own feet. I seemed to blend into the black; if not for the fact that I could still see and blink, I would have thought I’d lost my body to the dark.

Mary abruptly stopped dancing. Her arms dropped like weights to her sides, and her chin thumped against her bloody collarbone. With her facing away from the light, her entire form was in silhouette. Pinpricks shone from the depths of her eye sockets.

*“Dance with me, boy!”* she barked, voice no longer gentle and delicate. It sounded scraped out of her throat, guttural and gravely. *“DANCE!”*

I turned to run—and ended up right at the front of the church with her. I backed away with a yelp, but Mary took my hands and laced out fingers together. She stepped to the side in the beginning of a waltz.

“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” she cooed while I tried to yank my hands away. Her grip was unshakeable. “Didn’t your mother ever teach you manners?”

“I’m not—” My feet slipped as she dragged me into a pivot, and I nearly faceplanted right into her gored-open chest. “I don’t even believe in you.”

“Yes, it was your dearest Papa who did.” Mary nodded. “I can hear him praying to me for help from Hell, you know?”

I reeled back in horror, as much as I could with my hands still in her hold. “What do you want from me?”

She finally let me go and lifted a bony finger toward the back of the church. I turned to see what she was pointing at, but as with my last dream, the shadows around me had somehow worsened, turned solid and inescapable.

“The water, Ryan,” Mary said. The sound of rushing water suddenly reached my ears, roaring when there had been silence before. “Have no faith, and it will destroy you; have blind faith, and it will consume you; nurture rage, and it will unmake you; nurture passivity, and it will crush you; run from it, and it will cage you; hide from it, and it will hide you.”

Slowly, dark water crept into the illuminated patches of the floor. It sloshed against the bottom of the church pews, flooded to where I stood until it wetted my sneakers.

Mary’s nails dug into my jaw. She wrenched me down so I was looking at her. “Do not drown.”

Then, she violently smashed her mouth against mine.

I screamed as the stench of decay assaulted my nose and rotting flesh pressed against my face—a mistake, as Mary parted her lips and vomited slimy, decaying blood down my throat. I coughed and beat my palms against her shoulders to push her away, but she remained immovable, and my thrashing only caused the blood to spill from my mouth and onto my shirt, my jeans, my shoes—



\-



I sat up from the couch I was sleeping on, eyes wide, sweat beading down my face. My mouth hurt and my throat burned; I could still feel the wet, slippery texture of half-coagulated blood sliding against my gums, could taste the sour rot of it on my tongue. I gagged.

“…you okay, man?”

I looked up, still breathing raggedly. Across from me, Leo was frozen hallway through bringing a mug of coffee to his lips.

“…yeah.” I lifted the collar of my shirt to wipe my face of sweat. “I’m fine. Just a bad dream.”

If Mary even was a dream. The human brain could conjure up the strangest things, awake or asleep, under pressure or free from it. Mary could be my subconscious trying to figure out an answer to the thing in the sink and the constant loop back to the house. Mary could just be the stress getting to me.

The thought was as convincing as my excuse to Elise when she found my head bleeding on the bus. This was something else, I just didn’t know what. And with how scared everyone already was, I didn’t know if I should tell them, especially when this seemed localized to me. Why burden them with something I could easily carry? Everyone was dealing with enough shit.

Leo and I stared at each other awkwardly for a minute or so. Eventually, the man cleared his throat and took a sip of his drink. “Anika says her pastor’s gonna be here at ten,” he said. “So, um…you got thirty minutes to look presentable for guests, I guess. If you care about that sort of thing.”

“Thirty…?” I looked to the clock mounted above the television. True to Leo’s word, it was half an hour to ten o’clock—less, with the minute hand already two minutes past six. “Shit.”

“Sorry.” Leo winced. “We let you sleep ‘cause you looked really out of it.”

“S’fine.” I reached up to try and massage the tightness building in my forehead. It didn’t work. I groaned. “Anything else I gotta know before my thirty minutes are up?”

“Elise left.” Leo motioned his mug to the doorway. “Four times, actually. Ended up right back here each time. She’s out for her fifth attempt, but I don’t think that’s gonna do her any good.” He dropped his mug back to his lap and traced the handle with his thumb. “This house really wants us here, for some reason.”

He stiffened, abruptly, like he’d just had cold water thrown on him and it’d shocked him awake. He took a long sip of his drink.

“Sorry.” He grimaced. “I don’t know why I said that. That made it sound like this place is alive.”",4,1765758549.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1pmtkgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/1pmtkgy/yard_help/,Yard help,"Hi all, I think I know the answer but want opinions or just to get my 💭 out

My horse passed away and I will be buying another in a couple months.

I have a choice between yard A (that I am currently at) and yard B (one I have been to see)

I am not in the US, price, distance from home, and trainers are irrelevant because they all stay more or less the same.

Yard A
Pros:
-I already have friends here and love the people, yard has very little drama
-Nice XC track and plenty of space for varied hacking on the yard 
-Summer turnout is excellent, 24/7 in mixed herd turnout on high quality grass in large open fields 
-Strong owner presence until 4pm 
-Dogs are welcome and don't have to be on a lead (me and my dog are codependent on each other) 
-Yard has outdoor arena, XC track, hose with good pressure to wash off horses 
- owner grows the straw and hay so both are of good, consistent quality

Cons:
-XC track is unusable for a decent bit of the year (too dry and hard in summer, ATM too wet to jump most of the jumps as the ground is bad). From late autumn to early summer it is too dark when I get there 5 days a week to go hacking or jump XC. When I do get to jump it it is a lovely track.
-Turnout is only good for 4 months, then gets reduced depending on rain, horses getting out for 1ish hour once or twice a week the last month with no view of that changing anytime soon
-is full livery, however beds are mucked out poorly and horses left standing for 14 hours with no hay standing on piss soaked concrete unless I go up and hay and muck out myself (which I do obviously, but mucking out has to be done on the sly or you run the risk of the owner being in a bad mood and taking the head off you)
- arena is not harrowed often and is only half lit, has been mushy and difficult to work in (on the days it is safe to ride in it) for most of the winter. 
- owner not willing to change any of the above
-indoor and outdoor drinkers always dirty and grimy with moss floating and growing on outdoor drinkers
- has a coffee station where they sell tea/coffee, do not have anywhere to make yourself a cup with your own materials if you don't want to buy or they aren't open


Yard B
Pros
- much better facilities, multiple well drained arenas (including an indoor) that are well lit, hot water wash station that is lit and covered, covered lunge pen, walker, solarium, clean heated drinkers
- 27/7 turnout year round on one system (the system I wish to use), set routine of 8 hours out with stables and runs attached the rest of the day year round on the other system
- stables are fully matted and beds are well mucked out and cleaned to a high standard 
- grows his own hay
- ad lib hay, owner puts a high emphasis on as much turnout as the land will allow and believes in a forage first based diet. Has a personalised system for each horse that allows them a tailored hay diet while in a group that lives out (e.g ad lib, 30 mins per hour, 45 mins per hour access etc) cannot go into that much more detail without giving away the location but it is very impressive 
- seems like nice hacking, could not see all of it from the main yard however, seems to be both on and off yard 
- hosts shows on the yard several times a year
- canteen with tea/coffee station
- owner comes down late evening and ensures horses have enough hay to last them the night if they are in, this also provides security that if you were riding on your own and had an accident he would find you

Cons
- dogs have to be kept on a lead (a bit inconvenient I'd imagine), which also means dog cannot come hacking
- sound silly but 95% of my social life comes from the yard, I find it hard to make friends so the idea that I might not gel with anyone on the new yard scares me a bit, and since the owner tends to take it personally if you leave for any reason and can get quite mad I may not have the option to go back if I change my mind. I do have one friend so far who is moving to the new yard aswell which makes it easier, although I haven't known her long she is lovely
- no XC, I'd have to invest in a box to jump outside of the arena  
- no back shoes or barefoot (which I do prefer, and I can buy scoot boots/glue on plastic shoes if needed, but worry about traction when riding or jumping in fields at shows) 
- limited to buying a gelding if I want 24/7 turnout, this will be open to mares down the line, just limited to geldings while he finetunes the system) 


Basically what I am facing feels selfish, I love the social aspect of the yard that I'm on, but I feel like I'm paying a lot of money to not ride sometimes because the facilities aren't maintained well. More importantly, I don't like horses standing in the box day in and day out. It would be nice to not have to go up to the yard alone at nearly midnight to muck out and hay because it otherwise wouldn't be done after working for 14 hours, or not lying awake worrying if I can't make it down for some reason that my horse is more miserable than necessary. 
My dog being able to spend time with us is also important to me, and I worry he won't have the same freedom if I move

Many of you encouraged me to report the barista who intentionally put her eye crust boogers into my coffee. So I wanted to update you on what happened. I called corporate and they assured me it would be taken care of and I would receive a call from the regional manager. It’s been weeks and I never received a call from the regional manager or a call back from corporate. 

Y’all encouraged me to call the health department to report it which I did but I never received a callback from them either. According to my friend who recently went into the Starbucks where it happened (Connecticut) and this disgusting woman still works there and is most likely still doing this to people. 

The moral of the story… 

**Starbucks is totally OK with their baristas putting hazardous, disgusting things into the drinks of their customers.** 

Boogers? Bodily fluids? Who knows? Think about that the next time you go to Starbucks and get that first sip feeling 🤮 This is why I will never go to another Starbucks as long as I live.

***~~My dislikes:~~*** ***ultra sweet gourmands, spicy, white florals, sugary vanilla***

***My 1-5 Rating:***

1: not into it

2: might get around to liking

3: can appreciate but woulnd't FS

4. would get a FS eventually

5. NEEEED the FS expeditiously

# CocoaPink:

* **Herbal Essence:** oh my god!!! i love it lol as soon as i smelled it i was taken back to high school and my teenage bathroom. i will be full sizing this for sure. need it as a hair perfume spray at the absolute least. **5/5**
* **Cherry Almond Tart:** this is one of my attempts to add a gourmand to my collection. I have been craving something along the lines of Commodity Milk+ but I wouldn't pay that much for that scent profile (isn't my daily wear). this is a delicious synthetic syrupy cherry opening, sharp and bright like a lollipop that's cherry flavored, not quite a natural cherry. i don't mind that, a lot of people prefer a photorealistic cherry and i love that too, but this works for me here. then you get a whiff of baked goods, as it progresses, the cherry takes a backseat and i smell like a flaky almond pastry. i enjoy this one a lot, it's very sexy and fun i'd say. i'll wear it for my husband on a date or something but won't be full sizing. **3/5**
* **Homicidal Girlfriend:** very interesting...i need to add the description to even remember what i smell: ""The sweetness of vanilla pancakes & boo-berry blueberries; the piquance of black leather and musk; a whisper of woods and spicy florals; and through it all the threat of gunpowder."" it's like a dr pepper syrup that turns into a leather jacket and a strike of electricity..it reminds me of overhead lights in a liminal space, and i love dr pepper so i kinda like this...will wear the rest of the sample. **3/5**

# Morari

* **Phantom Forest:** leather-y woody goodness. love. it's sexy as fuck imo. i can see myself wearing this on date night a lot. and also when i just wanna feel like catherine zeta jones (dark sexy sultry feminine) **4/5**
* **Fig and Bergamot:** super green, i love it. feels clean, fresh, luminous. it feels simple enough to layer with other scents that could use some balancing. will be getting a bigger size. **4/5**
* **Woody cashmere:** disappointed, according to the notes this should be my #1 but i didn't like it much. smells like a generic woody male fragrance imo, not enough cashmere for me. **1/5**

# Sorce

I waited for so long for my special order and I'm happy to report they are win after win. i nailed it. I also got some samples:

* **Between the sheets FS:** LOVE. elegant, delicate, layered. It smells like an expensive young woman you see in a 90s movie you want to grow up to be...a fluffy jacket on top of a cashmere sweater and the fig is green but not too herbal. i know it gets a lot of hate on here and people smell bell pepper instead of fig but thankfully that was not my experience at all. im still letting it rest because the skin musk note was a bit overpowering upon first spray but i smell it in the bottle every day and i drool. it's fuzzy and cozy, definitely meant for cold weather so i'll be giving it a good wear test later next month when it's cold. **5/5**
* **Falling stars Mashmallow cloud oil:** LOVE. soft, dainty and creamy. reminds me of lovely mornings at home, my man making me a coffee and being cozy. the coffee is bold but not bitter at all, and the marshmallow swoops in after a bit making it a creamy latte scent. after a while all i smell is a your skin but better type of scent, a vanillic musk. i love this one, been wearing it to bed, in the morning while i do stuff around the house.. i have not let it rest lol. It's delicately sweet and doesn't smell too strong like the gourmands that usually turn me off.  **5/5**
* **English Major:** At first spray i thought it was too sweet, but I've changed my mind. I love the juxtaposition of the old book scent in the background and the subtle sweetness on first whiff, it's so unique and comforting. I can see why I only got a sample but I will definitely FS this soon. I've found the gourmand I was looking for. **5/5**
* **The Ancient Waters of Venus:** total disappointment. i am so glad i didn't blind buy a FS...i came so close! all i smell is blueberries for some reason.. it's so so sweet and cloying to my nose.. too much sweetness and not enough aquatics for me, i really wanted to like this. **1/5**
* **Serpentine:** all cardamom no fig. didn't expect to love this anyway so i don't care too much. it's too spicy for my taste and too cardamom heavy, if you like cardamom this would be great! **1/5**
* **The Lovers:** banana laffy taffy! love. i usually dont like bananas but this is fun and playful. got a sample bc of the iris, bamboo and styrax notes, the banana overpowers everything else for me but i think id still get a bigger size at some point. **4/5**
* **The things unsaid:** the cedar reads as a green stem but if i focus i smell the woodiness..the raspberry plays nicely with it but once again this is more sweet than aquatic. i wish the rain notes were more prominent or for the raspberry to let the peony have a moment in the spotlight!! i'll try it again later. **2/5**
* **Dragonfly wings: 5/5. 5/5. 5/5.** saffron and white rice, that is all. i hate jasmine but i cant place it in this one, so im very surprised i enjoy this so much. i wasn't supposed to love this but wow! it's soft and cozy, very enveloping and warm imo. it doesn't feel summery to me, more of a cold autumnal scent..i'll keep wearing my sample but this is an absolute need!

# Cirrus:

* **Enforced modesty:** wow!!! this is so nostalgic for me. i smell the marble and i am transported to the many catholic churches i grew up going to. there is something a bit herbaceous to it but that doesn't overpower the fragrance. this smells like the expensive bath products in my mom's bathroom growing up, i'd always sneak in to take a whiff. it's so smooth, creamy yet refreshing. i see green and lilac when i wear this sample. i want to bathe in this...i wish i'd FSd it during their black friday sale :'). **5/5!!!!!!** wish id gotten a sample of Snooze too..and Moonbathing..and Palomino.

# Kyse:

* **Fichi e Panna:** bury me with 100 bottles of this. i love this. fig!!! milk!! that's it!! it's somehow evoking so many other vibes for me though...this is something you'd wear as a yoga teacher in 2005, soft, delicate and creamy but still light and refreshing. i smell this and it's like i have a cold glass of milk sitting next to a juicy green fig. it's not too sweet, just the right amount. i need a FS noooowwww. **5/5!!!!**

Hey there,
Throwaway because I dont use reddit 
But I want to get something off my chest a bit 
Not the same as talking to a real person, I know, but I dont actually know who to talk to in this situation, mostly because I fear being judged and im a bit ashamed of myself.

Id really just like to vent and put my thoughts into words. But if anyone wants to share thoughts on anything here please feel free if you think itll be helpful. 

Was going to post in r/vent but I dont have a reputation apparently haha

Sorry there might be a bit of reading but feel it appropriate to preface, im also very tired at the minute so im sorry for the rambles as well. Happy to provide more detail in the comments

Hope i dont come across as arrogant. I have trouble reading people's actions and tone sometimes. I want to convey this simply as observations and my thought process - i don't mean to seem presumptuous or arrogant at any time. Im just trying to work things out in my head

Im worried my bf might see this post as well so might leave out some things.

I (24F) am in a long distance relationship of 3+ yrs (28M) and its been really great but over the last year or so he has become extremely like.. emotionally immature, distant, disregulated. He has outbursts of anger over small things including things I do.  

When I have personal issues or issues with the relationship it takes so much courage for me to bring it up. Because of things in my past that im working on I guess - but I have gotten so much better at coping with my anxiety/depression. I can now actually communicate very openly with people whereas at my worst i would shut myself away for months at a time. So I have come a long way although Im still very introverted and scared of rejection, his anger, his dismissal of my emotions, his defensiveness when I try to communicate things that bother me.
Basically when I open up about things, it turns into an argument about who did what and when. We both get defensive but I usually end up guilty and apologetic and comfort him. I dont claim to be perfect, its just upsetting that he doesnt tell me anything until I bring up an issue Im having.

One time I was really distraught about a buildup of global news stories. I had been drinking a bit on a night out with him and friends and I was very upset about the headlines I was seeing. He just walked away from me. I was crying in the street. He said he was concerned other people would look and think he was being abusive.... ? 

Im not and have never really been a very sexual person. Sex makes me feel awkward. Its hard to relax most of the time. But sometimes it can be fun. I guess its hard for me to be in the mood every time. I value quality time and small intimacies. Cuddling and kissing, talking about our day. Very boring stuff but its what i value the most. I have always been open about that.

Again, last year or so, the emotional difficulties between us have led to a lack of intimacy, and he accuses me of withholding sex from him, and he gets frustrated. Says men have needs. I feel for him, I really do, but I cant help it. I just dont want to. The emotional connection is so frayed.
I have really tried. I got him a thoughtful gift for christmas, a sequel to a book he loves that just came out, along with a few other little goodies (he tried to guess the gift after I told him not to spoil the surprise, which he did, which is something else he does that kinda annoys me as I want to keep it for the surprise). So despite it all im still.. trying, where i can.

Admittedly I am so busy with work and home life, and I am studying for a degree. He has so many extracurricular activities outside his own job too, and unfortunately we rarely find time to play games or spend time online together. 

At the moment also, he hates his job and hates being long distance away from his family and friends etc. He is clearly miserable. Hates his boss. His role etc. But he gets paid very handsomely and he finds that difficult to give up. I know he has a lot on his plate so, I dont want to bring up any problems. But its all I can think about and they never get resolved, just cycles again and again and again. I bring something up, he gets defensive, gets swept under the rug.
In short, and I appreciate you can only take my word over the Internet as I cant be bothered typing out a years worth of arguments, I have tried. But I am clearly not helping him. And I dont know how to help him. He wont communicate it. What i do is clearly not enough. I try to listen and be a comfort and help him find solutions. Seems like his issues would be solved by him taking a career break where id support him and be with him to help rejuvenate both him and our relationship, or he can go travel like hes always wanted. But he doesnt want to give up the salary which I understand. He has the resources to leave, im not sure what else I can do for him at this point.  

I started a new job nearly a year ago now. I love it so much. I love the work I do and I love the people I work with. The experiences i have had have been like nothing else. Colleagues and managers, I get on with every single person in the office. I find it so fulfilling to work there and have built up some really strong relationships. So rare to have such a supportive network of people that genuinely just want you to be happy and do well in all aspects of your life, they make sure youre okay, they treat you like a person. And it doesnt feel like work because most of the time its just fun since everyone is so great and the work is so fulfilling. Sorry, could gush about it for hours. 

Well, I sorta developed a crush on my boss' boss. Hes such a nice guy. But, I accepted it as just that - a crush. In fact I felt the same way about a lot of the people there. Comes from a place of admiration mostly, and curiosity and just wanting to get to know people better. I think a lot of the women crush on him because hes so sweet and very tall. Handsome rugged type. Reminds me of Jim Halpert from The Office US tv show. Im sort of part of his team but he doesnt directly manage me or my colleagues. We dont see each other often, once a week if that. And even then, I keep my distance because im aware of the little crush I have and dont want to risk anything. Not that I would ever act on anything while in a relationship myself, and I definitely dont want to make crush feel weird in the workplace. Also, its inappropriate to have relations with a manager lol. 

When we do see each other at work, we will have intervals of light hearted banter, ask about our work and our day, weekend plans, holiday plans. Make each other tea/coffee. Occasionally get lunch together or as a team. In between that, we keep our heads down and get on with work. Very standard friendly - professional relationship. I keep my answers short, again just trying to keep it friendly as Im aware of the little butterflies I have atm. But I notice he does try very hard to keep conversations going, and he will only stop when someone needs him for something, gets called away to meeting etc.

I would say there is a little bit of chemistry between us. When i first met him on my interview day, i saw him in the office and said i thought he was a celebrity. My colleagues have said he was absolutely glowing for the rest of the day, he was so happy to have heard that. Really made his week haha. To clarify, it wasnt a compliment - it was like a fight or flight reaction for me lol. But it was a funny moment that people (him included) still reference and like to tease me with. 
We are often on the same wavelength, finish each other's sentences, share core values and humour. But again, could be the butterflies talking. We are both very empathetic people, so maybe thats something. No big deal, its normal to have flutters for other people now and again. I get it all the time  platonically. I just love getting to know people who share interests and goals, which isn't an uncommon thing at all. I dont get that in my family, and not my bf in recent times. So yeah, I love everyone I work with, and just so happens I have a very nice relationship with this guy.

I have also noticed he tends to be in my peripheral, tends to linger around, he'll join me for lunch shortly after I go to the lunch room without me inviting him. But.. its a small office. And I have a crush, so of course I notice him when hes around.. ?

I have caught him staring a good few times as well, which is passed off with a polite smile before turning focus to work again. 

I like to bake and share treats with the office, he is one of the first to send compliments to the chef. Hes made a point of telling me how much he loves the brownies I make.

I had to do a public presentation in front of 1-200 people and he would always offer help in preparation for it. I politely declined, to avoid 1 on 1 interaction, and also my manager (F) was already gonna help me with it.

He also routinely checked in on me when my manager was off work. I had a personal problem earlier in the year and he would pull me aside into a private room to make sure I was okay. 

Once, my car broke down. And he offered to take me 40 mins out of his way after work, to go collect it from the mechanic. Which was super nice of him. I gave him some banana bread in return. He was going to get some fast food I had never had, and he was insisting I should try it, but didnt outright invite me. I just loosely said yeah, maybe, but gotta get home to my dog tonight, or something like that. He commended me on my determination and work ethic on that drive up, he said how much he admired me for taking on so much. He did the same degree I am currently doing so he was telling me how cool it was I was working full time too. 

..

So.. recently. 
My bf and i had a huge argument again about communication, emotional needs. Both of us were crying on the phone to each other for like an hour. So.. im still in a weird state of just not wanting to open up to him about anything to avoid that again and protect myself from the negative feelings that arise out of those interactions. I think im getting better at standing my ground, and giving us space when the conversation turns unproductive, but not quite there yet. We still text every day but you can tell its strained.

I had a work Christmas outing in the city that week. It was a long day, I was there from 9am until maybe 1am. It was a day of company/team roundups, achievements, dinner and a fun trivia quiz and then everyone went for drinks in town. I didn't really speak to him much until we went for drinks. I followed my manager, a couple colleagues and my head of dpt to the bar next door, he was buying our team drinks. I sat down beside my manager and began talking to her etc. Then, my crush sits down next to me. He is talking to someone else at the table most of the time, but we are all kinda talking to each other a bit too. You know how it is lol.

I notice his leg has been pressed against mine for quite some time and neither of us say anything. Maybe he doesnt notice? I dont want to embarass him?.. his foot touches mine a couple times under the table. Not caressing, more like tapping.  
Whatever, I dont think he realises. And Im bot bothered. Continue talking to the women at the table.
I reposition myself as subtly as I can but a few minutes pass and I realise his leg is still ever so slightly touching mine. I look at him and laugh it off but he's not looking at me, he's talking to someone else still, so maybe he doesnt realise. Whatever.

We share a few laughs and stories. I did some paintings as Christmas gifts for some colleagues who were now quite drunk and parading them around. My crush among others were amazed at them, said I was very talented, that the paintings were beautiful etc. That he had 4 dogs he'd like me to paint. I was a little embarrassed but grateful for the praise. 

Later, I got up to see if anyone wanted more drinks. I offered everyone there a drink to which they declined at that moment. My crush says HE'LL buy ME one. I said no, I was the one offering, and would get him a drink first. But he insisted. Practically ran to the bar to get there before me. The interaction was playful i think. He knew my order and brought his and my drink over. He handed me the drink and his hands brushed mine for maybe a second longer than it should've taken. I was a bit tipsy, maybe things just felt like they were in slow motion. I said thanks and we continued to mingle with the group. 

Again, we finished our drinks. I offered to buy a round, and again he said no, he would get me another drink. And again as he handed me the drink, he brushed my hand with his again..  ? Okay.. 
I didnt acknowledge it, I thanked him for the drink and continued conversation with the others.

Me, him and another colleague ended up talking together. He was teasing me about my height as he is maybe a foot or more taller than me. He then recounted all the relatively handsome celebrities he has been compared to, including me, bringing up that interaction when we first met.

We left the bar and went to another place. We stood outside the venue, mingling with other people etc. But he would always end up beside me in a circle and his shoulder, arm, hand or leg was always slightly touching me. Maybe he was cold? 

Again he made sure a drink was in my hand lol. 

Anyway it was this vibe for an hour or two before people went to go get food etc. I sat away from him at this point while we ate then he ended up beside me again while queueing for another bar. 
Some girls behind me were accusing me of skipping the queue. I was just following my friends, I honestly did not see them. If I did cut them we were maybe only like. A few seconds after. I honestly dont remember if I did skip or not but I apologised. I said they could go ahead of me if it mattered that much to them, and they still continued to give us a hard time about it. Crush appeared and talked down to them, said we all joined the queue at the same time, and then pushed me out of their way a bit. Idk where they went after that but appreciated him stepping in as I dont deal well with confrontation especially when I have already tried to de-escalate.

After this I realised the last train for the night would be leaving soon so I said I would leave to go catch it. He offered to walk me to the train station so we did. He waited with me there for about 30 mins then his ride came, and my train shortly after. We shared some more laughs, recounted our highlights of the night. I shared some personal thoughts about the job as my contract ends in a few months. I said id miss the people a lot. He said, ""which people?"" And I realised.. him, mostly. But I didnt say that, I just laughed it off and said everyone, generally. His whole demeanor softened and he said he will be sorry to see me go. He had a phone call and he looked down at it, hesitated, then went to ignore it. I said should you get that? And then he did. His ride was there. 
He lingered for an extra couple minutes. He said I was a great person who he really admired. He insisted on a goodbye hug, which he thanked me for, before going on his way. I was thinking about the fact I was the only one he hugged goodbye that night. The fact he asked for a hug and then thanked me for it. That was the first time I was that physically close to him.

And. I have been thinking about him non stop since that. I feel horrible. I have been trying very hard in my current relationship. Investing as much as I could so that it doesnt all just crumble down. 

I feel like absolute crap about it. I dont know what to think. Feels like high school drama or something. I dont know whether to tell crush so that we can keep a better distance or if that would make things really weird. Because he's a great guy, id love to be his friend, but realistically... is that appropriate? No, not really. Not in my book. 

I am so scared my boyfriend has been so emotionally void that I have found it in someone else, and now my brain/heart/whatever has latched on to that since its what im missing. And I dont really know how to unlatch that and put it back. 

I know I like my crush for the person he is, the way he carries himself in and outside of work. The way he treats others, his sense of humour and compassion. But, is he just someone I feel more comfortable opening up to, someone who listens to me instead of shutting me down, and so do I naturally feel more drawn to the safer person?

Im not even sure if this guy likes me, if he's just being friendly or is actually attracted. So, im equally worried about embarrassing him or myself by misreading his actions. 

If you want to leave your thoughts feel free. I mostly just wanted to get it written down somewhere. 

I think i will just keep my distance. We are both off work for 2 weeks during the holidays so it will be a good time to distract myself. I want my current relationship to work out. Just waiting for a good time to try and talk things through - again. 

Thanks for reading, if you did. Feel a little better after writing it down. ",1,1765758069.0,relationships,0,0.99,False

Goya Yuki’s apartment smelled of alcohol and regret. He lay sprawled across his sofa watching TV, his ice-white hair messy—proof of just how little effort he put into anything on the weekend. He had only just finished getting dressed before collapsing onto the couch, wearing grey sweatpants and a tattered hoodie he’d thrown on purely for comfort.

His plan to do absolutely nothing had been going perfectly; nothing could spoil his lazy afternoon. After all, he needed time to recover from the party at his flat the night before—something that was becoming far too regular. The party had left the place completely trashed. It was Goya’s idea of a complete and utter nightmare.

I hate parties, and guess who had to clean everything up, he thought through gritted teeth.

Still, he tried not to let it ruin his chill.

Well, at least I can relax now, I gue—

His thoughts were cut off by a barrage of knocks on his apartment door.

Goya turned his head slightly, still lying down, and stared at the door with total disinterest. He decided that if he didn’t answer, whoever it was would eventually walk away.

The knocks came again—louder this time—his annoyance growing with every bang.

Maybe it’s a really pushy salesman, Goya sarcastically pondered.

Turning off the TV, he attempted to give the impression that no one was home. He lay in silence for a couple of minutes.

“I know you’re in there,” a woman’s muffled voice said from the other side of the door.

Goya turned his head toward it again, realising he was clearly being sought out for a reason. With a tired groan, he dragged himself off the sofa, feeling like he’d been woken from hibernation too early. His back cracked as he stretched, and he shuffled across the flat toward the door.

As he approached, he peered through the keyhole.

Standing there was a girl who looked around eighteen to twenty. She had silky black hair that fell to her shoulders, blue eyes matching the jumper she wore, a small silver nose piercing, grey jeans, and a neat pair of white trainers. But the most obvious thing to Goya was the displeased expression on her face.

I’ve never seen this person in my life, but clearly something’s upset her, he thought as he unlocked the door.

“C–can I help you?” Goya muttered mid-yawn.

“Yeah, you can, actually,” the girl snapped with a healthy amount of sass. “You could help me by shutting the fuck up every now and then. I moved in two weeks ago, and since then you’ve made my life a living hell!”

Taken aback by the sudden potty mouth of a complete stranger, Goya stood there slightly stunned. He didn’t show it, though—his face remained deadpan.

“Lovely to meet you too,” he replied, clearly irritating his newfound enemy.

“You know exactly what I’m here to complain about,” she said, her glare sharp enough to melt steel.

“I don’t, actually,” Goya replied, not a muscle moving in his face.

“Oh yeah? So you don’t remember the Project X–scale party you held here last night? Seems like something that’d be hard to miss.” She flashed a fake smile that barely concealed her desire to strangle him.

“Doesn’t ring any bells. Maybe you dreamt it,” he said, turning to close the door, clearly uninterested in arguing.

Suddenly, a foot blocked it.

“Where are you going? This conversation isn’t over yet,” she said hastily, determination burning in her voice.

“I’m going back to doing nothing with my weekend,” Goya spluttered as he tried to push the door shut and dislodge her foot.

“Well, if you’ve got nothing to do, then you’ve got time to talk about the issue at hand,” she shot back, half-wincing as her foot was crushed between the door and frame—but refusing to move it.

They struggled like this for a good couple of minutes, both trying to win their pilgrimage across the threshold.

“Please get your foot out of my doorway!” Goya shouted.

“Well then, let me in!” she shouted back.

Using all her force, she slammed into the side of the door, flinging it open and launching herself into the apartment. Goya, completely unprepared for her human-battering-ram technique, ended up squashed between the door and the wall.

Half upside down, he scrambled upright and stared at the unwanted guest now standing in his flat.

“I’m not a lawyer,” he said, trying—and failing—to stay calm, “but what you just did is one hundred percent illegal.”

He said it while really emphasising the one hundred, but the girl ignored him entirely and began scanning the apartment.

“Hello? Hello?” Goya tried again. No response.

What is she doing? he thought. This is insane. Why can’t I just chill?

He sighed.

“Why… why is it so clean?” she muttered under her breath, clearly confused.

“What did you say?” Goya asked, finally hoping for an answer.

“Why is it so clean?” she repeated, louder now.

“Why is what so clean?” he asked.

“The apartment. Why is it so clean?” She began pacing.

“Because I’m hygienic,” he replied flatly.

“It can’t be this clean—not this fast. It’s like there was never a party.” She tugged at her hair, looking genuinely distressed. Then she spun back toward him. “I heard at least a hundred people were here last night. Why does it look like the place is about to be put on the market?” She pointed accusingly.

“That’s because you dreamt this entire party and clearly need to be locked up,” Goya said, circling a finger by his head. “Now, while it’s been incredible being verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, and having my home trespassed on, I’d like you to leave.”

He pointed toward the door.

“No. Not until you tell me how you managed all this,” she said stubbornly.

“I had a hundred extremely respectful nuns over who didn’t want to break anything. Satisfied?” he replied, rolling his eyes. “Now please, go away.”

She’d finally had enough.

“You’re the single most annoying person I’ve ever met. You’re like a human germ, I ha—”

“Shut up!” Goya yelled, the words echoing through the apartment.

She froze.

“You just won’t shut up! Somehow I’m the villain here when you broke into my apartment and harassed me! Even after I asked you to leave, you keep interrogating me like you’re some detective about to crack a case. All I wanted was to chill after yesterday because of that party—and then you show up! You know what? I don’t even like parties!”

An awkward silence settled between them.

Goya stood there, confused by his sudden outburst, trying to justify the flash of rage in his head. A few seconds passed before the girl spoke.

“If you don’t like parties… then why do you host so many?” she asked quietly.

“Did you ever stop to think that maybe—just maybe—I’m not the one hosting them?” he shot back, glaring.

“But how could you not be?” she asked, genuinely confused.

“Did you ever think I could have a roommate?”

She stared blankly and began to splutter. “You’re lying. I would’ve seen him by now. I would be aware if there were two people living here!”

Goya began to walk toward his kitchen.

“Well, you wouldn’t. He works late, so you’d be asleep by the time he gets home, and when he’s hosting parties, he just arrives like everyone else. To you, he’s just a face in the crowd,” he sighed.

“Okay, so how haven’t I seen him on the weekends, huh?” she argued, trying to find a hole in Goya’s statements.

“He stays with his girlfriend on the weekends. He hasn’t been back on weekends since they started dating,” Goya said while rummaging through his cupboards, looking for something to eat. “Man, everyone raided the cupboards—we’re out of food as well.”

Goya slammed the cupboard door, heading toward the kettle, determined to have a cup of tea to soothe his stress.

“So you’re telling me that the person who has all these parties is your roommate, who I never see because he works late and stays with his girlfriend on the weekend?” Her eyes were pinned to Goya.

“Yeah, basically that’s it,” he said, fiddling with the kettle. “Look, I’m not trying to lie to you—that’s the truth. I’m not the one hosting the parties, so you’re really speaking to the wrong person.” He shrugged his shoulders, going back to not caring about the situation.

“Well, you said you don’t even like parties, so why do you let him have so many? Surely you get a say,” she said, eyebrows raised, still not really believing Goya’s story.

“Well, I don’t get a say. He’s just letting me stay here. He pays all the rent. I’m just sofa-surfing,” he muttered while pouring the boiling water into his mug and looking at the girl. “Do you want a cup?”

“Absolutely not. I’ll have one when I get home,” she said, turning her nose up at him. “Just because you’re not the one having the parties doesn’t mean we’re all good now. I’m not going to sit and drink tea with you like we’re on some cutesy coffee date,” she scowled.

“That sucks, then. I was hoping you’d ask for a cup. I wanted to see if the dose of rat poison I planned to put in it was lethal,” he said, staring at her expressionlessly.

“Real classy,” she remarked, clearly unamused by his comeback.

Realising she had definitely overstayed her welcome, she walked toward the door. As she grabbed the handle, she shouted, “When you see your roommate next, let him know that he’d better stop the house parties, or I will be calling the police next time—and I’m not joking!”

She slammed the door to Goya’s flat, signalling that the blow between neighbours was finally over.",0,1765758032.0,writers,1,0.5,False

1pmtftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pmtftm/do_i_just_go_for_it/,Do I just go for it?,"For the past few months, I (28M) have had a lil crush on a woman I’m in a show with. We have a fun, playful rapport during rehearsals/when we’ve messaged back and forth on fb. She plays my wife and so we have a few intimate moments together. My radar (which isn’t always the most accurate) is telling me she’s interested in me too. As a precaution, just in case I’m wrong, I was going to wait until after the show (the show runs this upcoming weekend) to ask her to get a drink/coffee sometime so we can get to know each other better outside of the context of the play.

So,

Today I was chatting with another cast mate, and it somehow came up in conversation that the woman I have a crush on is starting grad school and moving soon… They didn’t say where she was moving to, and I felt like it would be weird of me to ask, so I’m just kind of hoping it comes up in conversation with her at some point.

Well, shoot.

At this point do I stick to my plan, or do I just abandon the plan? We have a whole tech week ahead where we’re going to be spending a lot of time together, so anything could come from that. I could just leave it alone, keep things from getting complicated, and consider that we may cross paths down the line. If I do that, there’s always going to be the “what if?” factor. 

If I do go for it, there are any number of ways it could go wrong. At this point, I still don’t even know for certain if she has any interest in me at all. That said, it could always work out too *shrug*

1pmtasv,https://i.redd.it/ngti8pprf97g1.jpeg,Finally nailed down the thumbnail,"… I think…? I don’t know, what do you guys think? 

All I know is that this has been a week long grueling process with my colorist of trying to figure out how to possibly create intrigue in the thumbnail, and then it kinda dawned on me. 

Put the male lead in the coffee shops’s alien mascot costume (which he absolutely abhors because he is in fact an alien), and the grumpy dog  Rus23, a.k.a. Rusty (the male lead’s AI assistant inhabiting the body of a stray) in the frame.

Before that I was just trying to make one of those “The leads face each other lovingly” pieces and the title. And it was so generic and ‘’meh?’ But IMO, the damn dog sells it. 

I don’t know if this will create intrigue or if anyone would even want to click on the webtoon based off this, but I feel like it’s… idk… not that bad?

Anyway, hope everyone had a great weekend!

Hate my boyfriends mom,"I (30) had my first baby with my boyfriend. She was born at 27 weeks and was in the nicu for 89 days. I knew it was going to be hard but I had faith everything would be okay. However, 9 days in we came to visit her and she was desating. No nurses came and only came when her heart rate dropped. It turns out her oxygen was not plugged in, I reported it. After that I started spiraling. My daughter was diagnosed shortly after with something that could kill her only for them to tell me a week later it was a false positive test. 
I came into the hospital and saw her oxygen liters were lowered without an order & she also had the wrong ID band on her. All these things broke my faith in her being well taken care of. 
My partner was not very supportive because his mom ( who is non confrontational) said I was “ making a big deal out of nothing” reporting all these occurrences. She’s also the reason my boyfriend was not there for our daughters birth because when I was transferred hospitals by ambulance, she told him to “ go home and make coffee and change his clothes”. 
She also forced us to tell people about my pregnancy before I wanted to/was ready because “ her daughter wasn’t planning to take any time off for the holidays so she needs to know now so she can”. Which is upsetting because my feelings weren’t respected just to benefit other people. This was MY pregnancy. 
I hold deep resentment about all of that and now I can’t stand her or the way he runs to her for advice about anything. 
Last week I told my boyfriend the baby carrier he bought was not safe for newborns & that it was harmful for her hips and please not to put her in it with her legs dangling straight down. 
I over heard his mom tell him “ put her legs down” and the next day, he was using the carrier with her legs down and I broke down. 
I had explained the risks to him and why it wasn’t a good idea and he ignored me because he listened to his mom. The same woman who made him miss the birth. 
Now I don’t even want to leave the room or for her to hold my child. Am I over reacting? ",1,1765757411.0,Postpartum_Depression,0,1.0,False

1. I purchased a Metene Blood Glucose Monitor on Amazon that I use every day or two. I think that it is fairly reliable since my A1C results are comparable to an average blood glucose of 103, which was aligned with the monthly averages I logged using my monitor.
2. I lost 15 pounds in the past six months and hope to lose 10 more going forward to get to my goal.
3. I started walking at least 10 minutes after my meals, most often after dinner. And I try to walk 10,000 steps daily, as well as added chair Pilates and line dancing to my exercise regimen.
4. I tried as much as I could to limit carbs and processed food. I started making sourdough bread, too. I have 1-2 servings a day without much effect the next day on my blood glucose. I still splurge now and then, but weigh myself often to keep me on course.
5. I’ve eliminated artificial sweeteners. Monk fruit is my new go to for my coffee, iced tea, and baking.

Mentally just a really hard day and not gonna lie I didn't do much lol. It wasn't even really food related I think this time of year is just hard with grief, family issues etc! 

A little annoyed I slipped with my energy today, but not going to beat myself up! Today was really hard and I still managed three meals and three snacks despite doing very little and feeling so low - I swear Sundays are the worst! Writing today off as a bit of a blip but no big deal, I still managed 'scary' things like whole milk, banana, PB and 'normal' chocolate. I also managed to get a decent plan in place for meeting my energy next week so that is a big positive. 

The food noise is still annoying my head quite a bit. Even today, particularly this evening when creating my plan for the week my head is like have this instead of this, but what if you want this instead of this blah blah blah. It is ***convinced*** that I am wasting energy eating similar things everyday and that I am wasting my recovery on 'safer' foods!! Does anyone get what I mean?

Also my head is now convincing me the chocolate plates are a bad idea because they are getting me acclimatised to chocolate when I shouldn't be having chocolate everyday, also convincing me my diet is very unbalanced and very unhealthy, too high in fat etc. Ugh it is so frigging exhausting. I am starting to worry my diet is a little unbalanced, as I look back at some of my previous posts and feel my fruit intake specifically has dropped and been substituted with sweets etc. I also have been constipated these past few days (TMI sorry) which makes eating harder but also has me questioning my diet and whether I am over doing the processed foods! 

Basically today hasn't been great, but could have been so much worse - tomorrow will be better and we will all have a great week, I am manifesting it! Hope you all are well! ",3,1765756965.0,recoveryplates,5,0.71,False

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

If any of this sounds like your style, feel free to reach out and tell me a little about yourself. I am always open to a conversation.",2,1765756949.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

As a non-coffee drinker, I’ve always been a matcha girl, even before it got hyped. I first tried it years ago (sa Starbucks pa), so their pure matcha has always been my go-to.

Now that matcha is everywhere, ang dami nang cafés serving all kinds of “matcha.” But most of the time, hit or miss siya. Plus, let’s be real, ang mahal na for just one drink. So I thought, why not just learn how to make it myself. That way, I can also experiment and R&D recipes that really suit my taste.

Overall, the experience was great. We started with discussions about matcha — its origins, the different types of tea, and the various matcha powders. We even did tea tastings along the way (with snacks in between, which was a plus 🤍).

Then came the most exciting part, the guided matcha-making session. We learned two methods: the regular whisk method and the cold whisk method. Since there were only five of us in the group, it felt very hands-on. The instructors were super helpful and really took the time to show us how to do everything properly.

VERDICT: I liked the cold whisk method more than the regular one. For me, this workshop was definitely worth it. I can’t wait to start making my own matcha at home. 💕",8,1765756742.0,FirstTimeKo,3,1.0,False

I spent more money than I needed to but take it from me, fellow impulse buyers and cheapskates, I'm watching out for your wallet.

Things that improved my coffee, in order of importance:

1. Fresh, local beans + correct grind and dose

Yes I know spending $100 on something ""boring"" is a mental hurdle, but the grind size impacts brewing the most and can counteract the limitations of a cheap coffee machine.

I bought a Moccamaster KBT, but nothing wowed me until I got fresh beans. Those beans will produce terrible coffee if you don't have the right grind size and amount however. Don't be afraid to experiment! Putting more, but coarser ground coffee does taste different than less but finer coffee!

 

2. Filtered water

Better water makes a difference for coffee, but going from tap to an under-sink filter makes water for me, my family, and pets healthier and tastier. About $50 or less depending on sale.

3. Coffee machine

Don't get me wrong, there is a difference between my Mr. coffee and the Moccamaster even with pre ground Folgers and 1 year old unground beans. I didn't realize black coffee had flavors other than burnt and bitter. The first time I tasted sweetness and nuttiness in BLACK coffee I made at home was genuinely rewarding. I got my machine for $150.

4. Some techniques do influence flavor

Speaking from my own experience with the drip coffee maker, using the right paper filter and rinsing it does make the coffee taste better, and stirring your grounds right when they get a little bit wet does help ensure you're getting as much flavor as you can.

and finally

There is no perfect cup and frankly unless I tasted two different preparations side by side, I  sometimes couldn't describe a ""good"" cup of coffee compared to a ""bad"" one and felt underwhelmed and poorer. But eventually my taste and preference developed where I can notice and appreciate the differences.",7,1765756288.0,Moccamaster,4,0.82,False

In person he’s a little bit more forward, he asks me to hug him and wants to know about my love life because i’m unhappy and in a dead end relationship.

I’m currently on my almost annual rewatch of CM, end of season 3 and although I’ve always noticed it, this time it really makes me mad: the BAU’s profilers are ALWAYS cutting Reid off.

Besides having an eidetic memory, Spencer is a well of knowledge. Not only does he know so very many things but also loves learning and sharing his knowledge with others. And I agree at times, like when he starts getting into the origin of a cultural practice or the etymology of a word while time is of the essence cause some woman might get killed in the next minutes. And even then there’s a way to say things. Only Hotch will be polite about it with a simple “Reid…” and then let him wrap it up, while Derek will cut him straight off, explaining whatever it was in a dumb it down way (example with this episode: Prentiss mentions an UnSub’s potential mental disorder, Reid starts explaining to the local cop after she asked, Derek cuts him off and just says “this guy’s a sick dude”).

But other than that, if they’re at HQ or in the jet and he starts talking about a subject with his beautiful big smile and eyes full of wonder because he’s so excited to share, Morgan, Prentiss and JJ are constantly cutting him off and often in a rude way, too. As I said it’s mostly Derek as he’ll be straight about it while the girls will be a bit more “subtle”, like getting up to get coffee, pretending that they have something to do or smoothly start another conversation, while Morgan will simply cut him off, finish his sentences or let him know to stop talking, make a joke and hint that he’s boring. I know it’s not that deep but idk maybe I kinda see myself in him in these situations, I’m nowhere near as smart as he is but I do love to learn and talk about things that people might not find interesting and also I know how frustrating it can get when you have so many things to say and no one who’ll listen.

This guy is your family, at least pretend to be interested once in a while.

Edit: I know Spence is their lil baby, the kid of the team, and they obviously all love him very much I’m not saying they don’t, at all, there’s literally zero doubt about it. I’m just saying they could let him go on about whatever subject once in a while and not cut him off or act as if he’s an annoyance.

I am headed to Costa Rica in March for the first time. We made the decision not to rent a car. Our hotel in the La Fortuna area (Arenal Springs Resort and Spa) offers activities/tours that you can book directly from their website. However, the postings on their website do not include reviews and I am not sure how big they are. 

These tours are pricey, but I could be willing to spend a bit of extra money for peace of mind when it comes to guaranteed transportation. That said, does anyone have any suggestions for reputable companies that offer tours/experiences with hotel pick up? Or alternatively, has anyone stayed at Arenal Springs Resort and Spa and can provide a review of the tours that they offer?

Travelers are a married couple in their late 20s. We are interested in nature and outdoor activities but not necessarily an adrenaline rush. Some activities that we are interested in include:

* La Fortuna Waterfall
* Arenal Volcano hike
* Hanging bridges  
* A low-adrenaline rafting/kayak tour
* Night walk
* Coffee/chocolate tour/experience 
* Zip lining, but would be more likely to do zip lining if it is combined with another activity just due to limited days
* Our accommodations have private hot springs for hotel guests, so we have that covered

[https://visitvictoryhouse.com/](https://visitvictoryhouse.com/)

This fall, after months of testing new recipes and refining our kitchen processes, we rolled out a new Victory House menu. The goal wasn’t to reinvent everything — it was to make the food better, more consistent, and more in line with what guests told us they wanted.

The biggest changes:

* We introduced elevated versions of our burgers, wings, and shareables, focusing on quality and execution
* Our Taco Tuesday specials used to be one of those “if you know, you know” things in Sonoma County — based on how popular they were, we’ve now added our most requested tacos to the regular menu
* We invested time, money, and real kitchen testing to improve consistency, speed, and overall food quality

[https://visitvictoryhouse.com/menu/](https://visitvictoryhouse.com/menu/)

We heard the feedback about where the menu could improve, and instead of brushing it off, we committed to doing the work behind the scenes to make those improvements actually happen.

If you tried Victory House in the past and felt like it could be better, we’d encourage you to give it another shot. The menu today is the result of a lot of listening, testing, and refining — and we think it shows.

In November, we opened Freeze & Fuel, a new quick-service café inside the building. It’s designed for people who want good food and drinks without sitting down for a full restaurant experience — whether you’re between games, wrangling kids, or just grabbing something to go.

What Freeze & Fuel offers:

* Bella Rosa coffee drinks
* Soft-serve ice cream
* Brownies and cookies
* The full Victory House menu available for take-out

The idea was to give guests more options depending on how they’re using the building — quick stop, long visit, or anything in between.

It’s another change driven by how people actually use Epicenter, and we’re excited to see how it fits into everyone’s visits going forward.",0,1765755362.0,PoppyBankEpicenter,0,0.5,False

You play as an IT support worker. Tickets come in as cards — you swipe left or right to make a decision. Each choice affects four stats: Productivity, Morale, Budget, and Entropy. When any stat hits zero (or Entropy hits max), the run ends and you start over.

Right now we have:

* Around 1,600 cards
* 81 different story endings
* Story arcs that continue across deaths
* A few minigames
* An actual voice actor (which is really cool to us)



Main inspirations were Reigns, Severance, Lovecraft, and The Stanley Parable.

If you have any sort of itnerest in this kind of game, it would be wildly appreciated if you would swing by our[ Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4225400/IT_Never_Ends) and drop a wishlist!

1pmsayo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1pmsayo/on_feminine_men/,On Feminine Men,"This post is not well-thought out but I just thought I'd thow it out there, see if anyone has some interesting comments. Posting on this sub because I always felt this sub is known for good faith dalogue generally and not ideologically-driven.

I'm male and 100% straight, but I still:

\- Want to be beautiful/pretty/cute. I actively dislike being associated with ""handsome"" and I prefer having long hair.

\- Am hypersensitive, very agreeable, compassionate, soft spoken. I can stand up for myself if needed though, just like women can as well.

\- Never liked beer (tastes like shit) but i love red wine. though I like black coffee.

\- The only role model I ever liked was Legolas, I guess because he's beautiful and elegant but still male?

\- Very submissive. Before puberty, girls flirted and teased me and I adored that. But then testosterne came and that ended, and I became extremely tall and also relatively ugly.

If I could choose, as if by magic, I'd be a female but a bit tomboyish perhaps. Maybe average height. Would be perfect as I could wear anything I want and nobody would care. I could have all kinds of cool hairsyles, paint my nails etc.

I've been reflecting around this stuff for several years now, especially the trans stuff being so popular... I tought that was mainly intellectual curiosity (I mean, it's quite interesting socio-culturally) but I'm starting to feel like this isn't just some random fleeting fantasy since these feelings aren't going away.

So, what I wonder is, do most or perhaps even all men secretely feel like this to some degree? I've only ever been me of course, but I honestly suspect that the whole man-thing is nothing more than a extra thing that you perform to a large extent. Even biologically speaking, everyone was once female. So it seems maleness is a divergence of eveyones true inner nature. Sort of anyway...

I know there's tons of men who would say ""oh no I would never want to go around being feminine and emotional about everything haha"" but I don't really believe that, like.. that could easily be a protective lie. I honestly think the emotional toughness displayed by most men, is a performance - not a reflection of bioloical differences. I think the differences are rather small, and that individuals differ way more between other individuals rather than the sexes differ as groups. If that makes sense.

My best friend who is gay (male) actually told me he believes this too. He thinks ""these straight men look so damn sad. I'm so glad I'm gay because I can just be myself"".

Thing is, if the difference was so biological, you'd expect that to be reflected in females too, but it isn't. Which brings up the tomboy/femboy issue.

Because tomboys are and have been accepted, in fact, applauded and is almost over-represented in media these days. There's strong female characters everywere in movies.

Femboys? Extremely sparsely represented and usually in a wholly negative almost cartoonish way.

Which begs the question, why? Why are masculine women applauded and feminine men are a joke?

But before we answer that, let's look at the current options for young boys like I once was.

In todays cultural ethos, there's kinda like four primary male stereotypes that programs society:

1. The ""alpha"", the tall, masculine, strong guy. Athletic, funny, kind of a player. Doesn't take shit from anyone.
2. The metrosexual. 20+ Tall, slim and highly well-dressed. Probably works in finance, business or law.
3. The good father. 30+, maybe works as a dentist or physiotherapist. Kinda boring. Probably wears a pink sweater and beige cargo pants.

Arguably, the metrosexual is only a variation of the alpha since both are tall and dominant/leaders. The difference is just the metro is less physically strong, but he's maybe rich or super smart.

But, young people (teenagers) are obviously not starting a family, so the ""good father"" archetype is irrelevant, also not much sex appeal at all.

So, what you're really left with is the alpha/gymbro/jock/whatever term you wanna use.

There are other types of course, but they're minor: the edgy/alternative/creative/artsy type (think, skateboading and metalheads etc.) Which I'm not sure if they are as visible today as they were in my time?

So, according to a few therapists I heard on Gender Critical podcast (highly recommended podcast btw), they talked about an idea I find makes a lot of sense.

There's this subset of young boys, sensitive, soft spoken, more on the feminine side who arguably has chosen to transition because they do not identify with the alpha stereotype whatsoever, and in fact identifies more strongly with the stereotypically feminine aspects.

Additionally of course, they are growing up in a world that demonizes men, that the ""straight white male"" is the bane of our existence. I mean, jesus wtf do you expect. And here's the thing, like.. kids aren't fucking dumb right? of course that stuff will have a deep impact, could even be subconsious.

So.. back to the question again. Why? Why don't these sensitive boys choose to be... well, feminine boys?

Why is it more accepted to be a transgender woman than a feminine man? Is the answer to be found in our recent cultural history or does this have something to do with fundamental evolutionary logic?

Some like the idea that everything is a blank slate and we are free from biology and think this is due to the evil patriarchy. But i don't buy that. I suspect it reflects somehing inherently different between a masculine woman and a feminine man in a way that people (particularly women) visceally react differently to.

I mean, it's interesting how the world seems to be full of submissive men but truly dominant women (I.E, those who would date a submissive man and not a hyperdominant man) are rather rare. I forgot the figure, but it's somehing like 10-to-1 ratio or some extremely unfair numbers game.

It's just very sad to me to think that, essentially, the male role is really a prison, it's functional, one has no inherent value or beauty. Nobody really lusts for you or desires you for who you are.

I'm sure there are some men who are perfectly happy being the way they are, but I suspect those people are rare (maybe 10%?) the rest I think are either unaware of their own nature or are simply pretending.

And what is it all for? Genes. That's all it is! the selfish genes just want to multiply! amazing? No... How sad.",1,1765754834.0,JordanPeterson,5,0.6,False

1pms8zf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pms8zf,How can I decorate my studio?,"I need advice on how to decorate my studio. I got my dream studio but I'm just not loving the space. I can't change the layout of my furniture or replace the big furniture like couch, bed, or desk but I can change smaller pieces like the shelf next to my desk, rug, coffee table, bedding etc. I really don't know what style I am going for at this point but I think I'm leaning more towards a minimalist mid-century modern? Though I don't think I was able to achieve anything like that. Here's some things I want to change or need advice on:

Bed area: I feel like the large fan looks really out of place. Can I change my bedding to make it look more cohesive? I am okay with getting rid of the fan altogether. But if possible would like to make it work.

Desk area: What do I add above the desk? I was thinking of floating shelves but am not sure where exactly I should place them. And I don't like the shelf next to my desk either. I added it to fill the dead space between my desk and the door. Is there anything else I can place to fill that space instead? Or a different kind of shelf?

Living room: Does everything look cohesive? If not how can I improve? What can I add on the blank wall above the shelves? 

Overall goal: make everything cohesive and keep things minimal. 

I am willing to spend $200-300 in total. But honestly the less the better so any cheap solutions would be appreciated. But I'm really just open to any suggestions or criticism. Thank you!!",1,1765754681.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Never Ends.** It's a comedy/existential horror game about resolving IT support tickets in a world that seems to have ended quite some time ago.

You play as an IT support worker. Tickets come in as cards — you swipe left or right to make a decision. Each choice affects four stats: Productivity, Morale, Budget, and Entropy. When any stat hits zero (or Entropy hits max), the run ends and you start over.

 Right now we have:

Around 1,600 cards

81 different story endings  
  
Story arcs that continue across deaths

A few minigames

An actual voice actor (which is really cool to us)

Main inspirations were Reigns, Severance, Lovecraft, and The Stanley Parable.

If you have any sort of itnerest in this kind of game, it would be wildly appreciated if you would swing by our [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4225400/IT_Never_Ends) and drop a wishlist!

1pms57x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pms57x/rf_best_enemies/,[RF] Best Enemies,"Best Enemies 

At the start of his sophomore year of high school James was headed to his first period class. That is when he saw her. She was standing in the middle of the hallway looking lost, desperate, and completely vulnerable, not sure of which way to go. James had the time so stopped and asked if this was her first day? She looked at him and asked “Is it that obvious?”

As James looked at her class schedule and said “Welcome to Riverside High. We actually have our first period together. Since I'm headed that way, just follow me. And we have a few classes together so stick with me and I will get you where you need to go. Consider me as your personal tour guide.” James had no idea where that came from. He was usually so shy around girls, especially pretty ones. And this girl was one of the prettiest he had ever seen. A flood of relief swept across her face.  “My name is James, by the way. What do I call you besides ‘the new girl’?”

A big smile came as she replied “My name is Amie. Spelled with an I-E, not a Y.” James then guided Amie to her first class and they sat beside each other. The next period they had different classes but James walked her to her next class and told her that he would be there at the end of class to get her to the next class.

At lunch James told Amie about what food was decent and what to avoid like the plague. Where the different cliques would sit, so avoid those areas. If you invade their area, you will be harassed and bullied mercilessly. Amie was introduced to Colin, James’ best friend since second grade. James also explained the kids that she needed to stay away from. James didn't want to say it in front of Colin, but Colin was one of those to keep distant from. He always was saying creepy things about girls and the older he got, the worse his comments were. Other than that he was a good friend so it wasn't so bad he would cut him off as a friend.

James and Colin had gym class together later in the day and as James expected, Colin made a crude comment about Amie. James shut Colin down quickly. James told him if he heard him say anything about Amie again he would beat him to a pulp and they would not be friends any more. Colin toned down his comments but would still say how pretty Amie was and how lucky James was. James accepted the comments as compliments.

At the end of the day, James found out that Amie lived a few blocks away from him so he walked her home. Colin lived in the opposite direction so didn't go with them. James was happy about that. He was still upset about the comment Colin made about Amie during gym class.

On the walk home, James learned that Amie's Dad worked as a manager for a nationwide restaurant chain and was moved every three years. She hated always moving and leaving friends behind. Her Dad was always working and it was usually at night so she didn't see him much. He would be gone from 10 AM until 1 AM. He had to work a lot of hours but was paid really well. When she did see him, he usually wasn't in a very good mood.

James told Amie that his Dad had died from cancer four years ago and his Mom worked as a nurse at the hospital on twelve hour shifts. They were able to get by, but they didn't have a lot. At the end of his life, his Dad wasn't able to work and the cancer treatments were not fully covered by the insurance so his Mom was left with a lot of debt. He was looking forward to getting a job so he would be able to buy some things for himself.

Their pattern became that James would pick up Amie in the morning and walk with her to school, walk her to her classes, spend lunch with her and Colin, then walk with her to her home after school. James asked Amie to go to the school dance with him. That is where they had their first kiss. After that they became officially boyfriend and girlfriend. When James met Amie's Mom Allison, she liked him a lot. Allison was in her late thirties and was very attractive. It was clear where Amie got her looks. When James’s Mom Hannah met Amie, Amie was accepted as a part of the family.

The summer James was 17, he went through an Emergency Medical Technician course at the local college that was sponsored by the hospital. As soon as James graduated high school, he was hired by the hospital as an EMT on the ambulance crew.

James planned to start to go to the local college to become a surgical nurse. He would work his way through school by working as an EMT. He had talked to his boss who assured him that they would work around his school schedule.

James and Amie were still dating seriously, but the big tension was that Amie wanted James to spend more time with her. She was a little jealous of all the women that James worked around. James assured Amie that she was the love of his life and after dating her, he couldn't look at anyone else.

The other thing was that James always would plan things out. He already knew what he wanted to do for his career and how he was going to get there. Amie on the other hand was impulsive. She knew that she wanted to go to college but had no idea what she wanted to do with her life.

Amie was working at an upscale department store. The only problem with that was being impulsive, when she saw some of the latest fashions coming in, she couldn't resist. Amie had a charge card for the store and would buy what caught her eye. She would spend more than she was making. Her Dad would tell her to spend more responsibly but he always paid her bills for her.

Amie knew that the time was getting close for her Dad to transfer again. She was trying to decide what she wanted to do. If she would move with her parents or if she wanted to stay there. She was 18 so didn't have to stay with her parents. Maybe she could move in with James.

Before Amie could come to a decision, her mother told her that she was not moving this time. Amie was told that her Dad  always worked late because he was having affairs and they were getting a divorce. The house was being sold and her Mom was already looking for a two bedroom apartment.

Amie didn't know how to process this. Her parents had been married for almost twenty years and she thought they would always be married. It felt like her entire world was turned upside down. Amie turned to James for stability. She needed someone just to hold her, to tell her everything was going to be alright. It felt like everything she knew was crumbling down around her.

Amie and her Mom moved into the apartment as soon as the divorce was filed. What Amie wasn't expecting was her Mom started dating immediately, as soon as they moved. Not only was her Mom dating, but she was bringing men home with her. Not only that but it was usually a different man each time.

This was too much for Amie. She started to spend more time at James' house, even when he was working and just his Mom would be there. Hannah told Amie that she needed to talk to her Mom about how this was making her feel. How her dating and bringing different men home was affecting her.

Amie agreed and talked with her Mom. Allison told Amie that her Dad's affair was not an isolated event. There had been several. It had destroyed her confidence. She felt that there was something wrong with her. She now realized that she was trying to get back at her Dad, to make him feel like she felt all those years. By sleeping with all those men, it was a validation that there wasn't anything wrong with her.

Amie looked at her Mom for a long moment and said “Mom, look at yourself. You aren't forty yet and you are gorgeous. Have you looked in a mirror lately? Any man would be lucky to have you look at him. You deserve a man that will love you and show you that he does every day. You deserve a lot more than a one night stand.” Amie and her Mom hugged and cried for a long time. All the emotion that they had held in for so long came pouring out.

The conversation Amie had with her Mom helped both of them. Amie didn't feel so isolated and felt closer to her Mom, James and Hannah. Her Mom understood that what she was doing was not affecting her ex but only hurting her and the ones that actually loved her. Amie and her Mom became a lot closer and developed an us against the world relationship.

James wanted to get together with Colin. James had decided to propose to Amie and he wanted his best friend to be there. They were not as close as they were during school, but James still considered Colin his best friend. When they got together it was mostly James talking.  James told Colin that he realized that he wanted to propose to Amie. She was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. He wanted it all to be perfect. He was going to pick up extra shifts so he could afford a decent ring. With what he had saved up already, it would still take a few months to be able to buy the ring. Then he wanted to take Amie out to a park at sunset and propose to her. Could Colin shoot a video of the proposal? This is going to be so great.

James started to pick up all the shifts that he could. He wasn't able to spend as much time as he wanted with Amie and always seemed evasive. He didn't want to let anything slip and spoil the surprise. And due to all the extra shifts he was often exhausted.

James arranged to meet with a wedding planner because he wanted the perfect proposal. He had Colin there since Colin was helping him with the proposal. James didn't think anything of it when Colin said that he needed to take a call and walked off.

James finally had everything in place. He called Amie to set up a date on the anniversary of them becoming official. He told her that he had a big surprise for her. Amie was very cool during the conversation, down right cold even. James couldn't figure out what was going on but didn't want to push it. He was busy with all his extra shifts so didn't have much time to call.

The day before the date, James picked up the ring. He then called Amie to confirm their date. It went straight to voicemail. When he tried later, he was blocked. He couldn't figure out what was going on. He called Allison. When she answered she said “How could you? I really expected more from you than that.” When James tried to ask what he did she hung up on him. Later James got a call from Amie's best friend. “I can't believe you are such a creep! You could at least have had the decency to tell her to her face.” Before James had a chance to ask any questions she hung up.

James had to get some answers. He immediately drove to Amie's apartment. When he knocked, Amie's best friend answered. He walked in and Amie was on the couch between her Mom and Colin. What in the world was Colin doing here? James started off “I need some answers now! What is going on?”

Everyone was glaring at him. Amie was quietly crying. Allison answered “I can't believe you would cheat on Amie.”

It took James a minute to register what he had just heard. He was finally able to stutter out “What are you talking about? I have never cheated on Amie!”

Amie's Mom shot back “What about all the late nights and extra shifts that you were supposed to work? What about being elusive and exhausted all the time? And how about this?” As she held up a photo on her phone. “Colin told us all about it.” James looked at the photo and realized that it was a shot of him and the wedding planner, only the angle it was shot made it look like they were sitting a lot closer than they had been.

James got a huge smile. “The  reason that I seemed elusive was that I had a surprise for Amie and I didn't want to let it slip and spoil it. The extra shifts were because I was saving up for this.” He pulled the ring box out of his pocket and opened it. Everyone gasped. It was a beautiful engagement ring. “I was picking up all the extra shifts I could because I wanted to propose on our anniversary of becoming official. And the photo is me meeting with a wedding planner because I wanted to have a perfect proposal for Amie. Besides, Colin was there with me.”

Suddenly it hit James. It was Colin that had taken the photo. It all fell into place. Colin was trying to cause Amie to break up with him so he could slide in. Amie suddenly started ugly sobbing.

Once she could talk, she said between sobs “All this was because you were going to propose to me? Colin convinced me that you were cheating. He said that I should hurt you like you hurt me. I have been sleeping with him.” She then collapsed on her Mom sobbing uncontrollably.

James glared at Colin and yelled “You have been my best friend since second grade and I have stood by you through it all. Now you not only stab me in the back but you twist the knife while doing it. My best friend became my best enemy.” Colin opened his mouth to reply. James quickly shut him up. He continued yelling “Don't even say a single word. It is taking everything I have to not kill you right now with my bare hands. If you say one word, I just might do it. I told you everything. You knew what I was planning and used it to stab me in the back several times. You are the lowest of the low and the creepiest of the creeps. You got what you wanted, I hope you are happy. You and Amie enjoy your life together.” He closed the ring box and slid it into his pocket. He walked down to his car. Once he got into his car, he completely lost it.

The next day Allison called him. “I am so sorry. I feel that I am partially to blame. When Colin started saying you were cheating, it brought back a lot of emotions from my ex. I made some comments that I shouldn't have. Colin was so convincing. He played all of us. Do you think that you will ever get back with Amie?”

James took a deep breath then said “I never say never, but this is as close to it as it gets.” Allison told him that Colin slinked out right after he left. It was a good thing, she wanted to wring his neck.

A few weeks later, James was finally getting to the point where he wouldn't break down at random times during the day. Now it was usually at night when he was laying in bed. James stopped by a coffee shop to get his morning fix of caffeine. He got his order and was turning around to leave when Amie walked in. As their eyes met, Amie turned white and just started to shake, not able to move. She opened her mouth to say something but wasn't able to speak. James started to just walk around her and leave. But he was not heartless. He put his arm around her shoulders and led her to a bench outside.

James sat down beside her on the bench. Amie started to say through her tears “I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me? I know that I should have handled things differently. But when I was told you were cheating I couldn't think straight.”

James had thought about it a lot so said “I could have possibly forgiven you for believing Colin’s garbage. What I can't understand why you didn't try to at least talk to me, to ask what was going on. You knew that I loved you more than live itself, that I loved you too much to ever hurt you especially in that way. I know what you went through with your Dad. But you never even tried to talk to me. Then when you jumped in bed with Colin, and I assume it was more than once…” Amie just nodded yes, “that is when it crossed a line that I will never be able to return from. Every time I see you, I will always see that. And I will remember that you didn't believe in me enough to question what you were being told. I still love you and probably always will to some extent, but I will never be with you again. You wanted to hurt me and you succeeded in that beyond what you can imagine. You caused a wound that will take a very long time to heal. It may never heal. I truly wish you the best, but I will never be in your future.” James gave her his mocha. She needed it a lot more than he did now. He stood up and walked away.

It slowly got better for James. He rarely broke down anymore. The hurt, sadness, and pain were still there, but that was part of his new reality.  When the girl that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with betrayed you and your best friend becomes your best enemy at the same time, you don't recover. You simply exist.

A few years later James stopped by the store to pick up some groceries. He did his shopping and got into a random checkout line. As he was checking out he glanced up at the cashier. She had tears running down her cheeks. It was Amie. James wouldn't have recognized her if they had passed on the street. She was thinner than she had been and no longer had the beauty she did. Her eyes didn't have the sparkle anymore. She just looked exhausted. Like she was carrying a burden too heavy to carry. James couldn't think of anything to say so just  gathered his groceries, gave her a nod, and walked out. He just felt a wound rip open again. Some things need to stay in the past.

1pms439,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1pms439/farting_mustard_gas_at_hoa_meetings/,Farting mustard gas at HOA meetings,"Due to the unconstitutional and historically illiterate decision by the HOA to DENY my proposal to erect a 32-foot steel statue of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (tastefully lit, rotating slowly, pointing toward the future), I have been forced to pursue alternative forms of protest.

Effective immediately, I have begun a NEW DIET consisting exclusively of:
	•	hard-boiled eggs
	•	sauerkraut
	•	whey protein
	•	black coffee
	•	lentils (UNRINSED)
	•	random debris from my lawn and the sidewalk
The result is a biological countermeasure I will be deploying at all HOA meetings.
My digestive system has entered what experts are calling “a non-proliferation failure.”
The emissions are silent, invisible, and ethically ambiguous.
Several have already described them as “mustard gas adjacent” and “a violation of the Geneva Conventions.”

Had you allowed the Lenin statue, none of this would be happening.
You chose oppression.
I chose fermentation.
Please 🙏🏼 understand: I do not WANT to weaponize my gut flora.
But when history knocks, sometimes it knocks from the inside.

My goals were always too big (""Run an hour,"" ""Write 5 pages""), leading to that familiar cycle of failure. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone.

The game-changer wasn't discipline; it was the **Micro-Habit** method: tiny, non-negotiable actions tied to old routines. But my biggest problem became remembering to do those tiny things consistently.

# 💡 The Problem is Overwhelm. The Solution is Flow.

Existing habit trackers felt too complex, adding friction where I needed simplicity. That’s why I spent months developing a tool

—a tool built specifically for the person who needs consistency, not complexity.

# 🚀 What Makes This App Different (And Why You Need It Now)

* **Routine Flow Builder:** We don't just give you a checklist. You build a logical **sequence** of micro-habits that flow through your day (e.g.,After coffee → 10 push-ups → 3 minutes of Spanish).
* **Zero-Friction Completion:** Designed for one-tap completion. The goal is to spend less than 30 seconds **in** the app per session, ensuring your focus stays on the habit, not the tracker.
* **Simple Stats:** Tracks your **consistency streak** without overwhelming you with charts. It only celebrates one thing: showing up.

I'm incredibly proud of the consistency this app has given me. I'm sharing it because I genuinely believe it can help you finally beat the 'Day Three Drop-off.'

1pms1ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1pms1ha/whathow_often_do_i_text_her/,What/how often do I text her?,"I (M27) have after a difficult period personally and years off the dating market decided to get back into the game recently.

I matched with this girl on Tinder the other day and we had some easygoing flirting back and forth that day, but not much more. We’ve both indicated that we’re looking for something long term. 

We don’t live in the same city (about an hour and a half by train) and neither of us have a car, but I’ve managed to secure a casual coffee date with her two weeks from now. Obviously I would have preferred it’d be sooner, but with work and Christmas etc., it seemed to be the first available date we had.

My worries are now though, that she will lose interest from now till then, and I feel like I need to keep texting her, but simultaneously want to avoid those boring “did you have a great day?” texts, or just plain boring practical planning. And as I’m not the most talkative person there’s also a slight worry we will run out of things to talk about on the date itself.

I know I’m probably overthinking it all, but she seems like my type and I don’t wanna mess this up. Any advice?",1,1765754130.0,datingadvice,1,0.67,False

The initial problem was nvidia driver not working for games (it does now but the display glitches) and when my laptop goes to sleep the screen does not turn back on.

I attempted to fix this by turning off Secure Boot and switching to a different version of NVIDIA, but after updating my screen is stretched and blown up. I am unable to change my display settings through the app.

Any suggestions on how to fix this would be appreciated.

October 9th 2020,
A date that is now forever carved into me lingering in my soul,
I shout at the sky, 
No words come out of my mouth, 
Just a pure primal raw hysterical painful call for help and understanding,
A sound that sounds like a time before language was created,
My chest feels like a million little needles suddenly and swiftly stab my heart,
Ripping through my ribcage like it was paper,
I dont know it yet but this is the first of many panic attacks to come over the course of 6 years,
My mind confused,
Fuzzy,
All my thoughts feel like the static of a CRT TV
I have just witnessed my first traumatic experience as an adult that will change the rest of my life,

3 months prior to this I lay in the sand,
Talking to my buddy Eric,
The conversation is about nothing,
yet,
everything at the same time
we have no idea yet but this moment, 
This one moment,
soon will be a fawned memory i look back on as one of our final moments in this friendship we created from dust,
Its warm out,
but with a cool breeze from the ocean,
The wind is pushing its way through the trees
Like some sort of childhood bully, 
He will soon ask me what I want in life, 
To which I will reply I dont know,
Happiness and freedom I suppose,
With a crooked smirk he will respond and say arnt we all,
Then,
Radio silence from both ends,
It is July 6th on the Oregon coast 

As I enter the apartment all I see is broken liquor bottles with each one being more and more bone dry,
Sucked of any liquid hope that once fill them, 
And trash,
So much trash, 
The glass coffee table that had been smashed,
A rocking chair in the corner,
that someone had ripped the left side leg off of,
And a single word carved into a old wooden side table....
""Forgive"",
A letter layed on top....
I can't remember how I was feeling in that moment,
Nervous I suppose,
The only thing that sticks out more then emotions is the the smell lingering from the back room,
I let out a uneasy sigh, 
Stand up from the side table that had been craved like a tree, 
Knowing then when I open this door the next thing that will be carved is the core my Essence,

And then,
there you weren't,
Your body layed out,
Like a sentence that had been cut off mid way through,
I dont know if you know this but the distance from your doorway to your feet was only 6 steps, 
But in that moment i wondered if this was as lost as mosses was in the desert, 
It would take me years to find home again,
A new home,
One where you dont exist at,
Where the friendship we had now just sound like folk lore when I tell others,
But it was real,
It was pure, 
It was alive,
We were both alive,
You weren't always just a Renaissance painting forever so beautiful and youthful
Behind glass and rope in the museum my mind created, 
No,
You were my friend, 
And friends are suppose to call, 
Friends are suppose to support,
Friends are suppose to help,
And above all friends are suppose accept you, 
No matter what,
So when I kneeled down to your lifeless body and I could finally gather the strength to say something,
I asked the only question you left behind in that empty room,

I bought another hopper as well as the wife does decaf. I’ll take the loss beans with purging for the 2-3 days she will have a coffee vs spending 3x as much on a J8 twin.

With that said, does anyone have any beans they recommend from Whole Foods to get this dialed in? I usually use southern weather from onyx but don’t want to waste $$$ dialing in the machine if I can dial it in with a similar cheaper bean. Hope that makes sense lol.

1pmrye1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1pmrye1/35m_seeking_vibrant_sparks_and_soothing/,[35/M] – Seeking vibrant sparks and soothing connections,"Hello!

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

Sleep still clinging to my eyes,
No coffee warmth in my veins yet
Just the glow of a hopeful ping.

An “interested buyer,” or so I dreamed,
For dog-eared books and honest words.
But out spilled venom instead of coins:
Accusations flung from a locked disguise,
A faceless judge demanding proof of self.

Too early, sir.
Too early for this kind of noise.

So I chose silence sharpened with resolve—
Report. Block. Done.
Let bitterness argue with itself elsewhere.

The books remain.
My peace returns.
Coffee will come,
And Monday will learn
I do not bargain with disrespect. ☕

1pmrw0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pmrw0f/genital_herpes_diagnosis/,genital herpes diagnosis,"Hi,

A girl I was recently seeing disclosed to me she has HSV2, and that was why she was reluctant to become intimate.

I appreciated it was really hard for her to disclose this. She told me late at night in bed and the next morning she had to leave very early, so we just said goodbye. (EDIT: she brought it up when we were in bed. we had been kissing and she turned away when i went to become more intimate. she asked is it a problem for you, and i said not a problem in itself, but only a problem if you don't communicate why. and that's when she told me.)

In the next days we were texting and i said i needed time and space to think about things. She said that was fine. I then suggested we get a coffee and discuss things, but we shouldn't do anything intimate for now. She responded saying it wasn't a helpful message.

I then text back agreeing that it probably left us in the grey zone. I messaged saying i didnt see a romantic future, nor should we stay as friends. As a final message, she text back saying she was hurt at how i managed a vulnerable situation.

I see her point of view but I'm unsure how else I could have acted. I didn't want to lie and pretend everything was fine. But maybe I was too vague when I asked for time and space.

How could I have handled this better, if at all?",7,1765753721.0,dating_advice,27,0.67,False

1pmrtvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1pmrtvk/dog_bit_me_need_advice_please/,Dog bit me - need advice please,"Back story: My friend found a stray dog almost three weeks ago and I decided to take him in. He wasn’t chipped and was in bad shape and appeared to have been abandoned. He seemed like the perfect dog - calm, didn’t have any accidents, was good on walks, not aggressive to other dogs, and slept through the night without issue. My friend told me before she brought him to me that he had bit her when she had tried to retrieve him from the passenger footwell while they were in the car. I didn’t think much of it since he had just been rescued and was probably scared. After a week, I noticed he seemed to do some resource guarding with toys I gave him. He growled at me a couple of times and it really bummed me out. 

Incident: Then last night I had a friend over and we had left a plate of food on the coffee table. He tried to jump up to retrieve it and I went to push him away from it and he bit me. It was a deep puncture to my index finger on my right hand. He didn’t let go right away. It was very painful and scary. I’m still reeling from it. I’ve been keeping my distance from him. I didn’t expect that behavior from him and I’m having trouble trusting him and feeling safe around him right now. The vet has told me he is likely 9 years old so I don’t know if intensive training would even be effective this late in his life?

I guess I’m just wondering what I should do and how I can repair the relationship or whether I should be seriously concerned and considering rehoming him? This is my first dog and our relationship was really positive up until this incident. I was planning on bringing him home for the holidays where there will be other dogs and children but now I’m a little worried.",3,1765753569.0,reactivedogs,2,0.81,False
