1g5pfxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dehradun/comments/1g5pfxs/botanica_osteria_cafe_in_doon_exposed/, Botanica Osteria cafe in Doon exposed ,"Imagine you are a coffee enthusiast and believe in supporting local businesses over chained restaurants and caf√©s (Yes even if it‚Äôs paying equivalent to Starbucks or more) 

I decided to go to much celebrated hyped cafe ‚ÄòBotanica Osteria‚Äô in  Rajpur Road, Dehradun to have coffee with a Freind. 

I won‚Äôt go into how their coffee and service was cause that‚Äôs not my concern right now.  

So we ordered coffee from the menu and water bottle. (Normal Vedic was the brand) 

Now coffee price is obviously stated in the menu and water bottle obviously was not! Vaise bhi by general rule it goes with MRP. 

Koi baat nahi 

We finished their sub standard coffee and waited for very long for server to come with the bill (we also waited for very long so that the server could take our order) 

Since we were getting late, I went directly to cashier to pay. I look into the bill and there was this separate bill for water bottle somehow!  

131 rs! To be precise with taxes and GST 

I asked him politely ‚ÄòI think there is a printing mistake here‚Äô 

The manager said ‚ÄòItna ka bikta hai‚Äô like very rudely! I remember his face clearly kyuki he had hazel eyes and was fair and he rolled his eyes to give me a look 

I immediately asked me ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the MRP of the bottle?‚Äô 

‚ÄòWater bottle branded hai, itna ka hi dete hai vaise bhi Cafe RAJPUR ROAD PAR HAI!‚Äô 

I immediately checked the bottle MRP and it was 60 rs.  

I was furious cause agar tumhari aukat nahi hai Rajpur road pe cafe kholne ki to khola kyu 

Or khola hi hai to ehsaan Kia mujh pe??!!! 

I simply asked them overcharging ki bhi had hoti hai 60 ki bottle hai 80 ka kar deta 

WTF is 131!!! That too with extra taxes on it! 

It‚Äôs not about 131 rs but what is fair and and what is not! Especially the attitude he was giving me! 

He didn‚Äôt do shit! UNTILL I actually called him ye bill jaa raha hai consumer court! 
See you then! 


He immediately snatched the bill from my hand and wrote 60 rs and remaining money he literally threw on the table in anger! 


Now recently my other friend went there and same shit happened to her!! I freakin lost my mind! 

You guys I don‚Äôt know why I am writing this! But I thought after my interaction they would have improved their services. Seems they are simply simply low life scums again doing the same with general public 

Airport pe water bottle ka price hota hai 80rs MRP to dete hai yaar! 

Overpricing bhi jhel lete hai if it justifies (like high altitude) but with that owner/manager attitude like I own him money cause meri galti hai Rajpur ke caf√©s mai se isska choose Kia caf√© to support local business is so infuriating! ",1,1729167253.0,Dehradun,0,1.0,False

1g5pduw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g5pduw/how_to_tell_if_a_female_friend_is_into_you/,How to tell if a female friend is into you?,"I've been friends this woman for what is now close to a decade, however a few months ago during a pretty emotional conversation (mostly on her part) I kinda fell for her.

Told her about it a while later, she was speechless. When I asked her If she was willing to go on a date sometime in the future however, she agreed. After that I didn't press the topic further as to figure things out for myself.

Since then she hasn't distanced herself from me, instead our conversations are more frequent and lengthy, especially as of late.

We were always very emotionaly intimate as in we talked about pretty much everything and hugging is pretty normal as well.

These last couple conversations however she started to initiate talking points way more on her own and texting went on for hours on end. Additionally she started asking me about difficult descisions in her work life. We work in the same field, however she is essentially my senior and she never did this before, usually helping me out.
Things like ""You'll be my deciding vote"" and such, which leads to long discussions about our responsibilities in the field, ethics and anxieties and such. Like that's work related, but answering those questions quickly becomes deeply personal, so If she intends to or not, she got to know me even better on some pretty heavy topics.
Also she has colleagues and close friends with as much if not more experience then herself, instead of me who is only getting started.

In our last meeting (which I did not consider a date, I haven't asked her yet) she told me at the end, that the last few months I've been beaming, while smiling directly at me. In that moment I kinda cracked and fumbled for words. I didn't really respond, though I think my feelings are pretty obvious.
I've been through some drastic change in that time, losing roughly 55lbs and advancing my carreer. 

She knows that what jumstarted the change was me catching feelings for her, I told her that from from the start. Though she could of course just be happy for me in general.

On that evening she also asked me to attend a party she was hosting. I had to decline due to another event, to which she replied with the Idea of hosting a second party.
When she invited me again to said 1st party a couple days ago, I told her I could attend for a short while, but I could also come over earlier and help her prepare (mostly cooking). She agreed with thanks but said we could also just go for some coffee at her place. Which again could mean something or nothing at all.

Like I know there is nothing specific, but I thought me telling her I have feelings for her would drastically change our dynamic, either her distancing herself from me or getting a bit flirty, I guess. Instead our relationship furthered in an unspecified direction in which we are even more emotionaly intimate with each other.

I know that she was in a long term relationship until last year, in which lack of emotional intimacy was kind of the nail in the coffin. 

In discussion on the topic we both agreed, that we do not want to lose each other, so I could understand her being cautious, but it could also just be her going with what's pretty natural to us.

1g5pdsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g5pdsp/love_triangle/,Love Triangle,"I met a guy in 2009 who I really liked.  We started as friends and later became intimate, but never really gave it a title of ‚Äúboyfriend/girlfriend.‚Äù  

At some point I moved away and he eventually moved near my hometown.  Several years later I also relocated to my hometown.  We hung out and I found out he had a girlfriend.  We ended up hooking up, and he had so much anxiety about it that he and I stopped talking.  

A few years later I reached out.  We started chatting and met at a coffee shop to catch up.  He was still with the same girlfriend.  He said their relationship was very much like roommates.  They have separate rooms and do not even kiss.  So this slowly turned into us hanging at my house and eventually hooking up.

We sporadically see each other maybe once every 6 months and hook up for the next few years.  I am always talking to him about wanting to date, how much I like him and how I still haven‚Äôt found anyone I like more than him (tho I have tried).  

So now it‚Äôs been 15 years since we have known each other.  He is 44 and I am 38.  I invite him over and he tells me they are getting married‚Äîbut just on paper for Power of Attorney (medical decisions) type reasons.  I start crying and tell him not to, that I want to be with him.  He had told me he would never get married because his parents are divorced, etc.  I suggest just doing Power of Attorney papers and not getting married‚Äîhe says he will do that.  He also told me her name for the first time (at least I believe so) and that she told him he has permission to get sex elsewhere, but she doesn‚Äôt want to know about it.  He says that he does love her and has such bad anxiety and that she‚Äôs the only one who would put up with how much space he needs, etc.  I tell him I also require space.  My social battery is drained through social interactions and then I have to have time to re-charge.

So now my mind has been wondering if he told me that as a cry for help.  Is he wanting me to find her and tell her about us?  Why would he share this with me?  I found her Facebook page (or at least what used to be it) and am so tempted to ask her myself if she really gave him permission to have sex outside of the relationship, etc.  

I am in love with him and would do anything to be with him.  I don‚Äôt want to give him an ultimatum, but have been thinking about it ever since he told me about the marriage plan.  He also has a low sex drive (as do I) but I cant see him cutting off sex completely.  
I plan on telling him I am in love with him if/when he agrees to see me again.

I have also been contemplating:
(1) Should I reach out to her?
(2) Should I tell him he has to tell her about us or I will?",1,1729167048.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Long story short, I'm leaving our team of eight people after almost 5 years together, and because we've been a pretty strong and friendly team over the years, I want to leave them something that reminds them of me without being inappropriate (like just giving them photos of me or something).



Something that's professional and useful but also personal - I've seen items like custom mouse pads, coffee mugs, or desk calendars that could feature photos from our office events, and they're not too expensive to get in bulk through [CANVASDISCOUNT](https://www.canvasdiscount.com/).

Hot drinks: mixing a cup or bottle with ingredients will allow you to craft a hot beverage. You will need to heat it up at a fire before drinking to get its full effects, you can drink it cold but you will only get the thirst increase and the slight stamina regen.

Drinking any hot drink increases you temperature to the equivalent of one heat pack, they should last longer than the heat packs by around 5 minutes. Drinking coffee or tea should slightly increase you stamina regeneration for a limited time but the affects should nullify with overuse. All hot drinks should increase you thirst meter by 3 arrows ( idk specifics, 4 is the max right?) Your hunger should only be increased by 1 arrow.

Soups: soups are sort of the same with how their heat function should work, however, soups can not be found they have to be crafted by collecting different herbs around the map or adding vegetables (zucchini, tomatoes, apples?) Hunger should go up by 4 if you max out the soup with lots of ingredients,the minimum increase for one ingredient is 2, the max amount of ingredients you can add should also be about 4 with water.

1g5p5ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoTravel/comments/1g5p5ql/weekend_in_tokyo_food_and_bar_recommendations/,Weekend in Tokyo - food and bar recommendations wanted (plus other suggestions welcome),"Hi all, as the title pretty much says, I‚Äôm in Tokyo next month for the weekend, where I will be meeting my friend who lives there. I don‚Äôt speak any Japanese, and it‚Äôs only my 2nd time in Japan so I‚Äôm really looking for some foreigner-friendly bars, some hidden gems to eat, drink coffee, or just hang out.

I‚Äôm staying in Roppongi (yes, I know, I f***ed up üòÇ) so in and around there is ideal but I‚Äôm happy travelling around if something is worth it.

Current plans I have are to go to Tokyo racecourse and Borderless on Saturday with my friend, training at Imanari Jiu Jitsu in the morning either Saturday or Sunday too.

I want to go to the Nintendo store (unless there‚Äôs something better) to get a souvenir/plushy for my son, and I want to get an NPB cap from New Era (or another store if they sell them). As a pro wrestling fan, I‚Äôd love to find somewhere to buy a Bullet Club tee, but I‚Äôve also considered going to Suzuki‚Äôs Piledriver store and I‚Äôd considered Ribera Steakhouse but feel like it‚Äôs potentially too far to trek given the limited time I‚Äôm in the city.

I arrive late on the Friday from Hong Kong so would like to find somewhere near my hotel for a drink and some food - I‚Äôm not a party guy so would prefer somewhere I can enjoy some music and just chill/people watch.

I'll do my best to be polite. It was a cold morning with no coffee. 

I have been having regular issues with the 13 bus in the morning (going downtown from slingerlands) to the point of having to take Uber/Lyft and I have been calling and making complaints.  Today, I was put on hold and then hung up on by a cdta representative.  Fun. 
This was after I told her the issue, how it's  becoming chronic, and the frustration I have with standing in the cold (31¬∞) while the group of commuters that I stand with are equally frustrated and concerned.  Mind you, the specific time slot that I ride is also the bus that several school aged children rely on to get to the middle school. The cdta rep said that since I already submitted a complaint yesterday,  that there was no point in putting another complaint in today, since there's a 10 day window for a call back to address the complaint.  I said I would like each incident documented and if need be, I would have the other commuters call and complain to get this issue resolved. She said that would not be necessary and then told me she could edit my complaint from yesterday to add details about today and the fact that it keeps happening.  I was put on hold for a little too long (3rd hold for the call) and then she just hung right up. They know me by name I'm sure there in the office. I'm sure they're annoyed. Shame that they make twice my salary and they get to treat people like numbers. Imagine how annoyed all of us are in the cold. 

This doesn't even scratch the surface when it comes to the complaints I have about other drivers, their rudeness or non-compliance.  
(Driver 5100, I'm talking about you and your attitude every. single. time.)

What are some other issues you have experienced? What has customer service done and has the issue gotten better or been resolved?",2,1729165951.0,Albany,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

Looking for advices on the next equipment to buy

Currently I have
- a cheap automatic espresso machine (beko) with milk foaming. My SO only uses this one as it's easy to make coffee.
- a v60. I use it the afternoon or in the morning if I have time.
- a sage smart grinder pro

I wanted to buy some gears to make better espresso, considering I would keep all the above equipment. 

I looked at the flair neo flex and thought it would be a good idea but any recommendation is welcomed! 
My budget would be between 100 and 500 usd (I know it's large ^^ I'm seeking to best price value choice)

Choosing the right JavaScript framework can feel like a daunting task, especially for beginners stepping into the world of web development. Many developers have been in that position, overwhelmed by the plethora of options available. It‚Äôs a journey filled with excitement and a bit of confusion, much like trying to pick the perfect coffee order at a bustling caf√©! ‚òïÔ∏è

For those just starting out, you might find yourself hearing about React, Angular, Vue, and even [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) from all directions. Each framework has its advocates, sharing their favorite features and why they swear by their choice. It can be tempting to follow the crowd, but it‚Äôs essential to find a framework that aligns with your goals and project needs.

Take React, for example. Many developers appreciate its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable code. However, beginners may initially feel overwhelmed by concepts like hooks and state management. It‚Äôs like being handed a set of advanced tools without a clear instruction manual! If you‚Äôve felt that way, you‚Äôre not alone.

https://preview.redd.it/jb3gqocb0bvd1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0365e1b2e25ea4991e3c897fd492adbaa2df9e

On the other hand, Angular might appeal to those who prefer a more structured approach. It offers a comprehensive framework with everything baked in, from routing to state management. However, some developers find the learning curve steep, especially if they‚Äôre coming from a more flexible background. It‚Äôs a bit like switching from a casual weekend bike ride to training for a triathlon!

Then there‚Äôs Ext JS, which is a fantastic choice for building complex, data-intensive applications. Many developers find its rich set of UI components makes development more efficient. For those who have worked with Ext JS, how did you find the transition? Did the extensive documentation help you navigate the learning curve, or did you encounter challenges?

So, whether you‚Äôre a beginner just starting your journey or a seasoned developer reflecting on your framework choices, the key is to explore and experiment. What framework do you think fits your style and needs best? What lessons have you learned along the way that might help others make their choice?

Let‚Äôs share our experiences and insights to help each other navigate this exciting framework landscape! üíª‚ú®

I'm looking for the name of the show where a female is the main character, and the main male character is named Kai, they both have some weird therapists that randomly appear. Actually their office appears whenever needed behind a random door whenever needed.  I think the male and female characters are from different times maybe, it was something out of the ordinary  
  
It's a series with actual people, it's 5-15 years old, maybe has 2 seasons, and was never popular.  
Kai is a blonde male who I think works in the coffee shop

  
at first, the female's life goes sideways if I remember correctly and then she starts seeing this therapist, this is not something usual, no one knows about the therapist, he's not to be found in Yellow Pages or the internet, doesn't have an actual office, the room that is the therapist's office just appears as she walks through a door, she doesn't know it's gonna happen  
then she meets Kai at the coffee shop I guess and doesn't know he also have that kind of therapist  
I think Kai was in 'her' timeline because he wasn't ready to participate in his and during the show he left

I am not mentally strong enough to fight my addictions , I just can't escape it UGH! 

Here's what, honestly, the last roughly 15 years of my life has looked like. 

Consuming copious amounts of sugar. This is ridiculous, I'm talking like a block of chocolate a day, easy, sometimes more. A bag of candy a day, sometimes 3 or four packets of treats every night, like 250g packets. It's insane I have all my teeth in tact (touch wood) 

Never interested in sports or exercise. Attempts to be into physical activities but it's always seemed too hard, too much effort. I walk/play with my dog for 2-3 hours every day, and thats it folks. 

Smoking pot every damn day mostly, a few breaks here and there, but never longer than a few months. I break down every now and then knowing I need to quit, that I'm tired of the memory loss and the munchies and the sluggish energy. But i've yet to discover the secret to breaking the addiction because a) pot has its positives too, if draws you back in baby! and b) I am a normal non rich middle class survivor who couldn't afford rehab without giving up my dignity. 

I don't eat breakfast, I drink 3 too many coffees in a day, my lunches aren't too bad, usually subway, salad bar, mcdonalds etc. Dinners aren't tragic, but definitely no where near balanced enough, basically not enough of anything that's good for you. 

I honestly just want to hand myself over to a health coach/life couch/guru or whatever and ask them to fix me, free of charge, renewed in health. 

Does anyone have some advice about simular situations they've been in? And how did you change?! Where did you get the mental strength to build new habits and quit the bad? 
I can't get past myself! Is it more effective to seek outside help? 

And someone hit me with all the things I'll be doing to my body and the risks I run, I need to hear it! 

Also maybe noteworthy, I am for the most part a very inconsistent, messy, lazy person in my personal life, yet surprising an opposite boss bitch at work. Probably some neuro diversity in there too.

1g5ouc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g5ouc7/aitah_for_distancing_myself_from_my_exfriend/,AITAH For distancing myself from my ex-friend? ,"Basically I (30F) had this friend (30F). We went to school together but only really became close after we finished. Fast forward many years and we've maintained the friendship. I've been with her through every trial life had thrown her way (abusive mother, bad breakups, friendship breakdowns, mental health issues). I've even been there for her when she needed support with her children such as organizing my husband's work roster to be home with our child so I can look after hers for the night while she gave birth to her second. She has a very low opinion of herself and basically hates herself as she has told me many times. In our teens/early 20s she would get her confidence by going from guy to guy at the clubs and having one nighters. That wasn't my scene so I never got involved but never judged either because I understood why she did it. Me on the other hand have only had two partners and I'm happily married to the second one. When I found my now husband, she got extremely drunk one night and tells me ""I don't like him. He's too young for you (he's four years younger than me) and he can't provide for you (I didn't need and still don't need providing for). She couldn't stand that I stayed with him and made things extremely awkward so I ended the friendship. Fast forward two years, she comments on a memory on FB that I was tagged in and we decided to meet for coffee and chat. That restarted the friendship (stupid me, I know now) because I really thought she had chilled out within herself and her opinions of others. Well we ended up pregnant around the same time and she had her baby a month before me. All is well (ish) for the first 4 years and the kids have grown up together and formed a close friendship. During this time her mask has slowly slipped and I've once again seen her for who she truly is and I decided to slowly distance myself. She would constantly bad mouth her partner, calling him a cunt and useless (he has his own issues but his efforts were never good enough for her), she even showed me a picture of his dick one day to prove that he's a ""grower, not a shower"". She's stated that if she could afford it she would leave him but she wouldn't be able to finance a house on her own with now two kids. Shes done a whole other bunch of things which she's proudly declared like withhold sex from him unless he was willing to get her pregnant again. She told him when she was pregnant with her first child that if he didn't propose to her before the birth then the child was taking her last name instead of his (he never proposed and they ended up hyphenating their last names together). Just weird controlling shit like that. Besides all of that, she constantly speaks poorly about her friends including me which I found out about and wasn't too surprised. Our kids go to preschool together so it's not like it affects them, they can still be friends. I've got no problems with that. 
Everything I've mentioned is less than half of what I could say this person has done to those in her life. Both our kids attend a weekly playgroup event for two hours at their new school for next year. One of the mothers told me that one week when I couldn't make it that this person was trying to plant seeds in the heads of the other parents about me, that was the final straw for me. Anyway, like I said, I've slowly been distancing myself. Accepting fewer invitations to things, not really divulging any information about my life to her, just giving her the bare minimum. I chose this course of action rather than speaking with her about it because I knew if I even hinted that she had done/said things that were upsetting/worrying/offensive then it would be gloves off and she'd attack me and paint herself as a victim. So I was hoping I could quietly just slip away from the friendship and let it die. Well wasn't that my biggest mistake? When she realized what I was doing she dug her heels in even further and started sending me messages of support such as ""I'm here if you need to talk."". She's never once done that before in the history of our friendship even when she knew I was low at times. It wasn't until she realized she was losing control that she decided to send messages of ""support"". I was nice in my responses ""Thanks a lot. I'll let you know"" or heart reacting and left it at that. 
Fast forward a bit further and it's orientation day for our kids who are starting the same school next year (yay). At this point I haven't seen her in approx 2 months and we've barely spoken on messenger so I thought ""Great, the friendship is running it's course"". Nope. She approached me quite aggressively at the orientation, didn't even start with a ""Hey"" or ""Hello"". She just walks up to me in a huff and says 'Whats going on with you? You've been quiet"". I said that I was just going through some trials at the moment but I'd be ok and I told her it wasn't anything personal (because if I did then I knew she'd get on the defensive and the outcome is never good when I've done that in the past). I thanked her for checking on me and left it at that. I was there for my child and wanted to focus on that. We ended the brief conversation on a good note or so I thought. A week after that interaction out of nowhere, she unfriends me on FB, leaves every single group chat that we were both apart of on messenger and gets a friend of hers to message me to tell me how horrible I am before blocking me. It was completely random and it felt like she was chucking a massive adult tantrum. I let it go and didn't respond in any way as I knew she was looking for a reaction via a message directly or me reaching out to a mutual friend to ask what was wrong. I completely left it because it wasn't worth my energy. 
Well a new term started this week and today was the first playschool back and holy shit it was the most awkward and uncomfortable interaction. We didn't acknowledge each other at all and when it came time for the kids to have morning tea, because our two kids are friends they sat next to each other. I naturally sat behind my child and she came over to sit near hers except in her big power move, instead of sitting facing the center of the circle, she plonked herself down and turned her back to me and cutting off her child from my own. Luckily her child was more mature than her and actually got up, moved around her and rejoined myself and my child while she maintained her position with her back to me, excluding me from the conversation being had with the other parents. I happily spoke to my child and hers like nothing was happening because I wanted to shield them from the bullshit. 
I just want to know, from that information alone (there's so much more of what she's done/said but this would turn into a thesis very quickly if I listed everything), should I feel guilty about wanting to end the friendship and should I feel at all guilty for trying to slowly slip away which triggered her huge reaction in the end? Id also really appreciate advice because I find this whole situation so mentally debilitating. She's very good at manipulating people (like me) so I know she will be getting into the heads of the other parents at my child's school whenever she can. How do I deal with this and not let it affect me? Thanks in advance",3,1729165157.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

A less known fact is there is another Lan tournament, the RES Regional Champions starting from the 22nd and ending on the 25th of October. Unfortunately this tournament will not have a live audience. But the venues that they are being held in are literally a couple of hundred meters apart. So while you are enjoying your time outside you might encounter some Dota players that you love that aren't a part of the BB Dacha tournament.

As a somewhat known Dota personality that will be involved with both of the tournaments who was born in Belgrade and went to high school 500 meters from these venues I felt it was my duty to the community to write a guide on what to expect during your Belgrade visit.

So here is the google maps pin of the venue [https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nd9koraTzDi3uG1G6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nd9koraTzDi3uG1G6)

**People**

A lot of younger people can speak English at least on a basic level. I don't know about younger kids, but with people from 25-35 you generally can't go wrong. And those are people you should ask for help and directions most of the time. People are friendly and they will unless they are in a hurry help you.

**Money**

The currency in Belgrade is Serbian Dinar. Interesting fact it is the 2nd oldest currency in the world only behind the British Pound. I assume a lot of you are going to be bringing Euros. The amount of dinars that you will get for 1EUR is around 116. That is the most common exchange price, maybe in big malls it is going to be around 115, and if you are changing a bigger sum of money, let's say 500EUR+ you can ask for a better deal in the local exchange offices and they will give you 116,9-117 per EUR. I have never heard of people being scammed by an exchange office in Serbia, so in that regard you are safe. Banks usually have a worse exchange rate than exchange offices. And exchange offices can be found all around the city. You really won't have problems with that. The translation of Exchange Office to Serbian is ''**Menjaƒçnica**'' but there will probably be a sign in English as well. 

In most places you can pay by both card and cash. But if you want to go to the local flee market or something similar, there they usually only take cash. Big stores, fast food restaurants and similar businesses do take cards, but just in case you should always have some cash on you in Serbia.

**Transportation**

Belgrade doesn't have a metro so your best way to get around the city is taxi/bus/tram.   
  
When it comes to taxi I would only recommend **Pink** and **Lux**. Pink is probably the best one, on the airport you can find some scam taxi drivers who will try to charge you insane prices but with Pink you are safe. They are very rigorous and tend to fire their employees for the smallest hiccups. As a local i can ride in any but I have heard stories of foreigners getting scammed. Maybe someone in the comments can recommend another company as well but when I go by taxi it is these two I look for. 

When it comes to busses and trams if you do have a local phone number you pay by sending and SMS, the details will be in every bus. You have options to buy a daily ticket or a ticket that lasts for 90 minutes. During this time you can change the busses and trams as you see fit. You will notice there are 2 zones in Belgrade, zone A and zone B. But I would be surprised if any of you are going to be getting close to zone B. The price for the 90 minute ticket is 50 dinars(0.43EUR) and for the daily card is 120 dinars(1EUR). For people that don't have local phone numbers you can download an app named BeogradPlus and inside of it you will have explanations on how to use it, and you can use your credit card to pay for transportation. If control enters the buss you show them the ticket in the app or the SMS that you will receive back and that is that.

Line 72 goes from the airport and has a stop close to the venue. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/kiK7KNdh83vsR7tu9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kiK7KNdh83vsR7tu9) , here is the link to the stop. 

There are a few rent a car businesses around the airport, as a local I never used them. But you have that option as well. The price of gas however is pretty high in Serbia. 1 liter of Diesel is 194 dinars(1,66EUR) and 181 dinars(1,55EUR) for 1 liter of BMB 95.

**Parking**

For those of you coming by car. The venue itself has a parking, the price is 60 dinars(0,51EUR) per every started hour. It is the classic way when entering you get a ticket and you have a terminal on which you can pay cash or by credit card before you park out. Then you scan the ticked when leaving and that's it. There is also parking around the venue. In recent years it was zoned and needs to be paid. Again for people with local phone numbers it is possible to pay by SMS, there are boards next to the parking explaining in which zone you are and how long you can park, and which SMS to send. For people without local phone numbers there is an app called Parking Servis Belgrade. You can chose the English language, register, chose the zone you are in, put in your registration and there is an option to pay by credit card. It is not as easy to use as the bus ticket one, but still not super complicated. If you have any questions you can still ask the locals. A lot of them will even pay an hour or two of parking for you if you really get stuck with the app. 

On the other side of the river from the venue, you also pay for parking in the same way, but there you also have an option of a garage. There are quite a few of them in the city and there it is around a 100 dinars per hour price to leave your car depending on which garage you go to. 

Obviously shopping malls have their parking. It is usually first 2 hours free and then the price varies, but it is often more expensive than a garage or parking in the street. You have a shopping mall very close to the venue called ''**U≈°ƒáe**'', but there is quite a few throughout the city. 

**Safety**

Belgrade is considered one of the safest cities. It is generally safe to walk around even in the middle of the night. Recently because of some immigrants, locals don't feel as safe as they used to, but attacks, murders and muggings don't happen. One thing I would be wary of is pickpockets. That can happen in a crowded bus or in an underground passage. There is one near the venue if you want to go to the Shopping Mall nearby so when you are down there and it's crowded, mind your surroundings. Other than that you are fine.

There is always idiots, so I would avoid talking about politics, that could be one thing that gets you into an argument with a local, but the chances of that escalating even if it does come to an argument is slim to none. Other than that if you act normal, no one will touch you. 

**Food and Drinks**

If you want to get fat Serbia is a place to be. Our portions are pretty big, and until the massive influx of Russians and Ukranians a few years back I didn't understand how hard it was for people to eat everything of the plate here.   
  
-For fast food and even a lot of normal restaurants you can download the app Wolt, or the app Glovo. There you can choose whatever you want. You could go for your classic KFC, some burger places and stuff, but I would recommend to try some local things. Pljeskavica is a big one, but anything from the grill will do, generally just look at the reviews and you won't be disappointed.

-Speaking of fast food the venue is close to a street that is called the street of the hungry 2 by locals, there is also the original street of the hungry but it is a bit further away. In the street closer to you there are a lot of fast food places but I would recommend Poncho if you want pizza [https://maps.app.goo.gl/HXgeGsXXrN46AZwXA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HXgeGsXXrN46AZwXA) , and you can put a chicken or beef salad onto it. It's very greasy, but you will get the idea of how the locals like it. The pizza slice isn't cheap but for most of the people 1 will do. A lot of people would recommend Poncho for some meat of the grill as well, but right next to it is a place called Caldo, that is where I ate throughout high school and even today I go there as well. Anything of the grill or the sandwiches and you won't go wrong. Very important is that a lot of these fast food places work 24/7, so even if the games end late, you can go for a 5 minute walk and get something nice to eat. Also an honorable mention from the original street of the hungry [https://maps.app.goo.gl/9UE4kHgwiDvcu2Lf9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9UE4kHgwiDvcu2Lf9) , there you can eat ''**≈†i≈° ƒáevap**'', it is a very well known place in Belgrade, you go there at 2 in the morning and there is 20 people in line. Don't let it dissuade you the line moves quickly. Locals usually eat the thing of the grill with sour cream and onions, and then there are some more things to add like mustard, ketchup or something else you like. 

-When it comes to restaurants, that is a bit tricky. Every part of the city has a certain amount of them that people like to visit. Durmitor is a very famous restaurant [https://maps.app.goo.gl/1AvyRGmHW5Zg2dHx6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1AvyRGmHW5Zg2dHx6) , that is somewhat nearby. Or if you really want to experience the culture you could go to ''**Skadarlija**'', [https://maps.app.goo.gl/heZB8EUWL4vxdx8MA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/heZB8EUWL4vxdx8MA) and there you have many famous local restaurants. From what I hear recently the quality has deteriorated, but Serbs are very good hosts, so locals have certain standards. But in Skadarlija you will get people playing live music, very well trained staff and solid food no doubt. One thing to keep in mind is that smoking is not prohibited by law inside, so most of the places allow it. If you don't like the smoke don't go to restaurants without an option to eat outside.

-One thing I would advise anyone to do is go to a local bakery in Serbia and get a ''**Burek**'' with Yogurt. Bakery is ''**Pekara**'' in Serbian. This is something you eat for breakfast generally, and it is going to be the best in the morning. The way you eat it is take a bite of burek and then take a sip of yogurt. You have Burek with meat, with cheese or without anything. Recently people are making different variations, like pizza burek, but locals mostly eat the basic three. Serbs from Bosnia will tell you that burek is only with meat and that everything else is a pie, but they have no idea what they are talking about. Try to go to local shops, not the big chains of bakeries [https://maps.app.goo.gl/JXxUqjmrT24wco176](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JXxUqjmrT24wco176) this is one example that is nearby. But you have other options as well. I haven't eaten burek in quite some time in the area, but you can ask any local in the street where there is good burek and they will point you to the nearest place. Burek is usually sold in grams, I would eat like 400g, but for normal people around 250g is the right amount. And if they are selling per portion it's usually going to be 250g.

If you want to sit for a drink, coffee, beer, whatever, there is a ton of cafes nearby. If you want a beer ask for something local, homemade coffee is basically Turkish coffee, but you have your other options that you would have anywhere else in the world. Also wherever you are in the city you can ask the locals where you can drink good ''**Rakija**'', that is our alcoholic beverage, made from fruit. Plum rakija is the most popular so you can ask for that. Also wherever you venture into the city there are a ton of cafes as well, and you generally can't go wrong. 

-If you get a chance to visit a local market. Two things to buy are homemade ''**Ajvar**'' and ''**Kajmak**''. Ajvar is made from red paprika, it can be spicy or normal and almost everyone who visits Serbia loves it. Kajmak is made from milk it is very greasy so some foreigners don't like it but we Serbs adore it. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ro7TNhFgxqdU5sAAA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ro7TNhFgxqdU5sAAA) this is a very famous market where you can find everything, it is far away from the venue. But there is a local market relatively nearby [https://maps.app.goo.gl/ip9EzQSUnsjkQ6539](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ip9EzQSUnsjkQ6539) , you can get there by tram or by bus number 95.

-All shopping malls on their last floor have your standard fast food places. KFC, McDonald's and alike.

**Sightseeing**

A lot of people are not going to be staying for long. If you just want to get the general feel of Belgrade. You need to visit **Knez Mihailova street** and **Kalemegdan**. The street is basically a walking zone, there you will see the square with a horse and a rider. It is a statue of Knez Mihailo, makes sense cause it is in Knez Mihailova street. And at the end of the walking zone you go into the Kalemegdan Park, where there is a fortress as well. That is a must, everything else you visit is a bonus. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/V4nSFRpjF5CK8SFR6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V4nSFRpjF5CK8SFR6) . To get to the walking zone from the venue you again take the Bus 95, but towards the city this time, and the 2nd stop after the bridge you go out and people will point you in the right direction.

One other big thing to visit is the **temple of St. Sava** [https://maps.app.goo.gl/TA6kTUuLNbzn48U56](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TA6kTUuLNbzn48U56) .

We have some museums across the city if there is anything in particular that interests you. You can find them online. I haven't visited recently so I am not going to be giving any suggestions. Some of them change their exhibition, some of them have a constant one. 

Some people might just want to take a walk by the river. ''**Zemunski Kej**'' is relatively close to the venue, about a 20 minute walk. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/LMnZ4vHnrh9xHrHXA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LMnZ4vHnrh9xHrHXA), this is the end closest to the venue. But if you want to go from one end to the other, you will need at least an hour, maybe even more. And it is a pretty crowded walking area, but talking a walk in any direction around the venue should be enjoyable. The streets as I mentioned are safe. 

  
  
I am hoping this helps people, I am more than open to answer any questions. I am delighted that my city will be the capital of Dota, and a lot more tournaments have been announced in the future, so I hope that more of the community will be coming to my home town. 

I will be working the group stage online for BB Dacha, and I will be working the RES Regional Champions. So I will be at the BB Dacha venue only for the final day. Out of known personalities that aren't part of the event Bowie will be with me. Come say hi, if you see us in the crowd, if you need any help when I am there I am more than happy to point you to the right place or even show you something if it is nearby. 

**Welcome to Belgrade!**

1g5onvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/find/comments/1g5onvs/please_help_me_find_a_book/,Please help me find a book,"This has really been annoying me because no matter how I search I can't find this book, so hopefully Reddit can help. It was a mystery book aimed at children that I'm pretty sure was scholastic as it had the Apple on it but I'm not positive. It had a detective team with 6 members and it was a series of cases where it would be a few paragraphs of the case then the answer.

The detective team was the main character who was the classic grizzled detective trope who had a K-9, then the tough guy (who im pretty sure was scared of snakes) and then a more nerdy member who was also a man. Then there was a girl who was the forensic scientist and one who wasn't shown often in the book but I think she handled tech stuff? Then there was the crime scene cleaner who was only seen a few times.

Some of the cases: The first one in the copy I had was a lawyer getting murdered by his assistant, which they found out by where the bullet entered from.

A guy was accidentally killed because a gaming shop switched the coffee in an attempt to calm him down because he always got rowdy, not knowing he orders it a certain way because he had a health issue I can't remember.

On Halloween the main character figured out who egged this woman's house because the kids had run through bushes to get away that had cat pee and he saw it under UV light.

I can probably list more cases if needed, but any help finding this book would really be appreciated! It might have been a series but I'm not sure.",1,1729164483.0,find,1,1.0,False

1g5ok11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arecipe/comments/1g5ok11/strawberry_iced_oatmeal_cookies_recipe/,Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies Recipe,"These¬†**Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**¬†are a delightful combination of chewy oats and the fresh, fruity flavor of strawberries, all topped with a sweet glaze. This recipe takes the classic oatmeal cookie to a whole new level with the addition of dried strawberries and a light icing that adds the perfect touch of sweetness. These cookies are great for snacking, dessert, or even as a treat with your morning coffee!

In this article, we‚Äôll show you how to make these delicious cookies from scratch and offer some tips for baking the perfect batch every time.

**Why You‚Äôll Love Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**

Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies offer a fun and fruity variation on the traditional oatmeal cookie. The dried strawberries add a burst of flavor that pairs beautifully with the hearty oats, while the icing drizzle on top gives them a bakery-style finish. They‚Äôre easy to make, perfect for sharing, and great for kids and adults alike.

**Ingredients for Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need to make these tasty cookies:

**For the Oatmeal Cookies:**

* **1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats**
* **1 cup all-purpose flour**
* **1/2 teaspoon baking powder**
* **1/2 teaspoon baking soda**
* **1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon**
* **1/4 teaspoon salt**
* **1/2 cup unsalted butter**¬†(softened)
* **1/2 cup granulated sugar**
* **1/2 cup brown sugar**¬†(packed)
* **1 large egg**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **1/2 cup dried strawberries**¬†(chopped into small pieces)

**For the Icing:**

* **1 cup powdered sugar**
* **2‚Äì3 tablespoons milk**¬†(or as needed for consistency)
* **1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract**

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**

**Step 1: Prepare the Cookie Dough**

1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.
6. Gently fold in the chopped dried strawberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

**Step 2: Bake the Cookies**

1. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 10‚Äì12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the centers are set.
3. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Step 3: Prepare the Icing**

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.
2. Adjust the consistency of the icing by adding more milk if it‚Äôs too thick or more powdered sugar if it‚Äôs too thin.

**Step 4: Ice the Cookies**

1. Once the cookies are completely cool, drizzle the icing over the tops using a spoon or a piping bag for a neater finish.
2. Let the icing set for about 10‚Äì15 minutes before serving or storing.

**Tips for Making the Best Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**

1. **Use dried strawberries:**¬†Fresh strawberries can add too much moisture to the dough, affecting the texture. Dried strawberries provide the perfect flavor without compromising the cookie‚Äôs chewiness.
2. **Don‚Äôt overmix the dough:**¬†Mix the ingredients until just combined to keep the cookies soft and tender.
3. **Cool completely before icing:**¬†Make sure the cookies are fully cooled before adding the icing to prevent it from melting and running off the cookies.
4. **Adjust icing thickness:**¬†If you prefer a thicker icing, use less milk, or for a lighter glaze, add a bit more milk until you reach your desired consistency.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of oats and dried strawberries in these cookies creates a wonderful texture that is both chewy and satisfying. The cinnamon adds a hint of warmth, while the light vanilla icing brings just the right amount of sweetness. These cookies are not only delicious but also have a touch of nostalgia, reminiscent of classic iced oatmeal cookies with a fruity twist.

**Serving Suggestions for Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**

* **Pair with a glass of milk:**Ôæ†These cookies are perfect with a cold glass of milk for an afternoon snack.
* **Enjoy with tea or coffee:**Ôæ†Their sweetness and texture make them a great companion to your favorite hot beverage.
* **Gift idea:**Ôæ†Pack these cookies in a decorative box for a homemade gift that friends and family will love.

**Conclusion**

**Strawberry Iced Oatmeal Cookies**¬†are a delightful upgrade to the traditional oatmeal cookie, with the addition of sweet strawberries and a light glaze. These cookies are easy to make, bursting with flavor, and perfect for any occasion. Whether you‚Äôre baking for a special treat or just because, this recipe is sure to become a new favorite.

I (23f) have a bf(23m) of 2 years. We met on the first day of college, became best friends and after 3 years we got into a relationship. He is a kind, loving, thoughtful, and genuinely nice person. We just graduated 2 months ago. He is a social sciences major and I am an engineer. I started to work full-time in the company where I was an intern before. He applied to 2 graduate schools but couldn't get so he moved back to his parent's house in a nearby city. 

After practically living together for almost 3 years, it is strange. I have political aspirations and generally am a more ambitious person determined to advance in my career whereas he is a more laid-back, chill guy who wants to be an academician. I spend my weekends in forums, panels, workshops, fellowships, or volunteering and he is playing video games or watching movies as an introvert. This was always the case since we were friends and I was a bit concerned about this dramatic difference between our expectations and ideals. 

Still, we are a cute couple with maybe fixable problems, I thought with an underlying concern about the future.

 Moving on, I have a group of friends in my workplace. We all started as interns and became close since we were not like colleagues but rather college friends. We hang out regularly at work on our coffee breaks and after work in bars etc. 

During a festival that we all went together with the intern group, I dreamt about hugging one of my closest friends(25m) among that intern group. A completely innocent dream with nothing more. When I wake up, I feel like I am in love. I cannot stop thinking about him. It was like I switched into a parallel universe where I was in love with him in the span of a night.  The guy is kind, easy-going, funny and caring, always there for everyone. However, no matter how good of a person he is, I could not understand why I was feeling like that. I HAVE A BF! The next night, we all got drunk  (completely acceptable and expected since the festival was organized by the company with unlimited booze) and that night I mentioned to him my problems with my boyfriend with exaggeration. He broke up with his toxic gf 3 months ago so we kinda talked about problems etc but we were not alone. I, he, and a girl from his team were talking together in a crowded room. 

After that, I dreamt about him 3 times more. All innocent. Just seeing him at the door of my house or bumping him on the road and saying sorry. However, I cannot stop thinking about him. I just find myself wishing to find him in the cafeteria or taking coffee breaks so I can see him on the terrace. I am not working from home and always going to the office so maybe we can chat a little. I got jealous of the girl on her team since she got to work with him all the time. She was not an intern but started after we got into full time so I know him longer than her but still being together all day makes people more connected. It is crazy. 

I am a bad person. I have a loving boyfriend but I want someone else's attention. It is killing me. I cannot talk about this with any of my friends because I feel like shit. I cannot stop myself from thinking about him. I cannot look at the face of my boyfriend without feeling guilty. I don't know what to do. This is both my and my boyfriend's first serious relationship and I have never imagined that I can be a cheater. However, I feel like I am cheating.

That night, he ( the guy from work) said to me ""You are probably gonna break up. Do you think he is planning to marry you?""  and I replied ""Maybe, idk. I am too young for this but I love him and I can manage to get through this"" and he said, ""Just don't play with the guy."" He did not know the exact situation of course. He did not know that I started to develop feelings for him. But as the drunk idiot that I am, that night I texted my boyfriend"" X thinks we are gonna break up but no I won't break up with you I love you and I am gonna work for it""

I still think love is worth working for but I am so confused...",1,1729164043.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I was asked to organize a basic training at work in the form of a power point presentation in a teams meeting for new hires. I am relatively new myself and this was the first big internal meeting (>50 attendants) where I am responsible. 

The plan was that I explain them the business and other experienced collegues are free to share their working experiences within the business to the next generation.

I was originally told to set a 1 hour meeting but some higher ups told me later that they want me to do this in 40mins. So I reduced the content, rushed through the slides and at the end there was no more time for further questions and experience exchange. Some colleagues felt clearly disappointed about that. They gave me the feeling I deprieved them of an chance.

I offered them to set a follow up coffee meeting in my calender if they want to discuss further. But nobody did. It seems the damage has already been done..

I started taking 150 XL last Thursday and have been taking it between the hours of 7:00-8:00 AM once daily. ***I cannot sleep****.* I've dealt with insomnia for years and finally overcame it in the last 3 years, so this feels really disappointing.

I'm sitting here feeling so tired about to start a very long work day and just feel - ugh.  
  
I do drink coffee, so I'm trying to keep it limited to one cup in the morning. I also take 300 mg of magnesium glycinate and sometimes ashwagandha before bed. Melatonin doesn't work for me as it makes my nightmares much worse. I typically don't get high quality sleep in general (lots of nightmares and intense dreaming) - so this isn't totally new to me, but the waking up every hour feels like torture.

Anyway, I've just heard so much good about Wellbutrin and I'm really excited to be on something. It's just really exhausting me from the lack of sleep. I'm working on having an accepting/positive outlook and I can definitely stick this out for a few more weeks (hopefully lol ugh).

Adrenal fatigue is often brought about due to illness, stress from a personal crisis or a difficult economical or financial situation. This powerful formula uses Chinese herbal supplements to fight fatigue and assist in the optimal functioning of the adrenal glands to increase energy production and promote overall well-being.

**Chemistry and Pharmacological Research of Ingredients of this Premium Supplement.**

Adrenal fatigue, also known as adrenal apathy, is said to affect millions of people around the globe. Most people will experience an episode of adrenal fatigue at least once in their lifetime - mainly due to an illness, a personal crisis, or a difficult economic or financial situation. Boxall & Carmichael Reboot has been formulated as an adrenal burnout support formula and aids in restoring and improving optimal functioning of the adrenal glands. Boxall & Carmichael‚Äôs Reboot contains a proprietary blend of Chinese herbal supplements that have been extensively used to treat fatigue and adrenal burnout. Energy in the day is essential to health. If we are tired, then we resort to coffee and sugar to find temporary unhealthy energy. This cycle results in worsening health. The hormones from the adrenal gland are vital for daily vitality. Reboot has been designed to supplement your adrenal gland, giving you the natural energy and strong immune system that you require for healthy living. Essentially, the ingredients in this premium product assist with adrenal burnout or low energy levels and fatigue, diminishing the effects of stress of the body and the brain.

Since I don‚Äôt have an Ode 2 or Opus, not quite sure how the grind settings will translate to my Capresso Burr Grinder. It‚Äôs not the fanciest of grinders but it does have a setting where I can control the amount that it grinds by setting the number of ‚Äúcups‚Äù and overtime I‚Äôve figured out roughly how many of its cups translates to the weight of coffee I need for my aeropress. 

For the weights that the Aiden suggests, is it weight of ground or unground beans? Wondering if I can figure out a similar system to use with the Aiden so I can just set my grinder and hit go in the morning.

1g5nyuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g5nyuy/keep_losing_jobs_23m/,"Keep losing jobs, 23m","Right before I graduated with my associates degree, I lost my minimum wage part time job right before the beginning of this past summer. I was cited for performance infractions. But I know the real reason was because I stopped talking interpersonally to management and just decided to focus on my job and leave everything at work, at work. 

I then started working at a movie theater. 1 month in, my immediate supervisor told me that I would not be paid for about 3-4 hours of training that I had completed.. which is against the Fair Labor Standards Act. I told them that and the general manager proceeded to argue with me. I told her I didn't want to report a wage claim if I didn't get paid, but I would if I needed to. Long story short, I was suspended, paid the money they owed me, and terminated.

I started working for a liquor store and my coworker stole a cash tip that was clearly personally given to me. I reported him and management said they knew his grandmother and that he wouldn't be punished.. so he's basically allowed to steal. I quit same day.

Started working for a coffee shop. Lower level immediate supervisor was **extremely** rude to me and my fellow baristas. Unprofessional, snarky, and nasty. She's the type that everyone would say is extremely nice and pleasant and bubbly when you first meet them. Then you see what they really are. And then she goes back to acting pleasant. A hot and cold personality as well as a person that likely believes that that makes up for their rudeness. After about a month of trying my best to stay out of her way so she would leave me alone, she, for the millionth accumulated time, said something extremely snarky with a horrible tone to me over the walkee. I couldn't help at this point but to respond with the same level of malevolence and then she started yelling at me on the floor. I told her I was going to report her for unprofessionalism and that set her off even further and went as far as to tell me that that was a ""threat"". I got sent home and I am currently here about an hour after the fact typing this now.

All of this happened during the span of the beginning of this past summer to now, 10/17. I guess i'm asking for advice on how to deal with people in the workplace.. as I am clearly not dealing with them correctly. And any other piece of advice anyone would like to give me in general. Thanks

About 9 months ago my life was completely different than it is now. Before I met my husband I was a stripper at a club. 

It was right before spring break, I had been working double, triple sets (8-12 hours) back to back to get enough money for my trip to Japan I‚Äôve always wanted to go on my first solo trip overseas. I should note I never work Sundays but this particular Sunday I worked because a guy at my job said why not you never know. I worked that Sunday and as you guess I met my husband but we will call him R for now. 

It felt like fate. We instantly clicked and spend the whole night together laughing and talking. He got there around 5pm and stayed until 6 am and it was absolutely amazing. I even went back to his hotel after because i really liked him and I never saw him as a ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù. I wanted to be with him.

However, in my past rarely did anyone take me seriously due to my job. I wasn‚Äôt willing to quit because I had to support myself. I have zero family support and was trying to pay for my college education. Everything I have i provided for myself since I was 18. I have also been working in the club since I was 18 so I have years under my belt. 

When I went to his hotel‚Ä¶ I freaked out. I realized I put myself in a compromising position because I was alone with him in a hotel room. I got PTSD from being raped before that I was shaking in fear. I didn‚Äôt know how to express myself at that time so he‚Äôs first impression of me outside the club was poor. He was very respectful and sweet. However he took my actions as not being actually interested which is understandable. After that awkward, horrible encounter I offered to buy him coffee in the morning. He declined. However, he said he still meant it when he offered me dinner the night before. 

We planned on having dinner right before my trip to Japan. We had our first date and I brought my friend along because she wanted to see me before I left since I had an early flight. Plus I wanted him to meet my friends and see their opinion because I really liked him. Dinner was amazing and we spend the night together. Luckily I didn‚Äôt freak out but we didn‚Äôt have sex because I wanted to wait. I really wanted to be with him so I didn‚Äôt want to give it up and him never call me again. I left that morning and we spoke while I was at the airport because I was super nervous flying overseas. 

While I‚Äôm in Japan we talk everyday. It was natural and fun speaking to him. I remember buying lingerie for when we had our special moment. I showed him all the stuff I brought and did a mini fashion show and asked what he likes so I could set it aside for him. I was buying outfit for work too. While I was there he even book me a spa trip. I paid for it at the time but he said he would pay me back and did for it. 

However, when I was in Japan I really wanted to kiss an Asian guy because I had never experienced it before. I go to a night club and I ended up making out with this guy (he wasn‚Äôt Asian sadly). I give him my contact info and he offers to take me out to dinner. We go out to dinner and he gets a room at the hotel I‚Äôm staying at. He spend the night together cuddling but we don‚Äôt have sex so no oral or penetration. We did make out and touch so like 2 base. 

I return back to America two weeks later and it‚Äôs been about 3 weeks since we met. He wanted to see me when I came back. I brought him gifts from Japan, he pays me for the spa and we have dinner again. That night we get a little spicy and we make out. I always told him before our dates that I wasn‚Äôt sleeping with him. It was protect both our interests you know I never want to lead someone on. However I try to keep my legs closed but he insisted on going down on me. I tried to resist but I let him. After he wanted me to go down on him but I declined because again I had set boundaries before. He was kind about it but we still we kissing and playing around. I was rubbing against him and grinding against his dick. Then he basically put his dick inside of me. I instantly felt violated because I had made it clear no sex and I trusted him so that‚Äôs why I was grinding on him in the first place. He apologized and was super respectful about it. I forgave him and continued to cuddle. 

Next he offered to show me around his city because he had been driving close to 4 to 5 hours to see me. I told him after my shift at work I would drive to his city to see him. It was together 4-5 hours from my house but luckily my job was about 2 and half hours away from his city. But after Japan, I was broke. I spend all my money there. Like allll of it. I had to work double shifts and deal with school. I was skipping school to go on our dates because I couldn‚Äôt afford to miss work. I work a double shift back to back. Since I live far from the club like two hours I sleep on the couch/ floor in order to wake up for day shift. I run off of 5 hours of sleep and work close to 8-12 hours. I worked Friday until 6-7am then sleep and start working again at around 5pm I have to eat and get dressed first. Then work until 6-8am Saturday morning and then work day shift at 5pm and then work until 6-8am again. You get the idea. I‚Äôm typically extremely exhausted due to dancing all night and wearing heels etc.

However that Saturday night, my on again off again ex comes into the club. We had been messing around off and on for two years. I was in love him but he would ghost me for months and then turn up ever so often to tell me he missed me. I always fell for it when thought I could tell he cheated on me when we were together and just used me for sex. However he was my kryptonite. He comes in that Saturday before my date with R on Sunday. He apologized for everything and told he that he just signed a pro contract for soccer and he wants me to be his girlfriend again. As much as I wanted him‚Ä¶ I told him I was seeing someone and I had plans. I haven‚Äôt really been with anyone but him and about two other people in the duration of our time together. I had always gone home with him if he showed up but this was the first time I had ever told him no. 

I work technically four shifts back to back however he wanted to meet at 6 pm on Sunday and I lived 2 and half hours away from my job. I packed up all my stuff, worked Friday, Saturday and then I knew I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I would never make our date. After I reject my long term fling, ex situation I chugged two Red Bulls and drove to Chicago after working 8-11 hours just so I could see him. I stay at my college friends house so I could sleep, shower and get ready. I was beyond excited. 

Literally at 3:30 about two hours before we were about to meet and he knew I was in Chicago because I told him that I made it to my friends. He canceled. He told me his son was sick and he couldn‚Äôt make it anymore. I don‚Äôt have any children and I remember him telling me his kids were a little older around 12. I was furious. I was so hurt. I cried my eyes out. However I wanted to be respectful and said it was fine. In my mind, I was like you couldn‚Äôt have even met me for an hour at least?? Or something? We didn‚Äôt have to spend the night together but at least coffee or something. I felt very embarrassed and stupid. I felt like I had sacrificed everything. I was skipping school Monday to hang out, I rejected my ex, I spend the little money to pay for gas and drive, I had lost money by not working Sunday, and I spend days planning, packing, choosing an outfit. I was so exhausted after work but drove anyway‚Ä¶. I felt like he humiliated me. I felt myself falling down the bunny hole of losing myself in a guy again and basically having what I had with my on again off again ex. After that I started taking him less serious.

On the drive back home after the failed trip he calls me and we talk. I‚Äôm talking we talked for 8 hours together straight. We just flowed and clicked while I was driving. It didn‚Äôt even feel like 8 hours. I had never been on the phone with someone that long. We talked about our life‚Äôs experiences and journeys. We started getting extremely close to the point where we would have these long 3+ hour conversations every night because we were busy during the day. That‚Äôs when he asked me if I was talking and seeing anyone else. At that time I wasn‚Äôt talking to anyone and I did like him. He mentions that he wants me make me his girlfriend and he wants to be together. He said that he would ask me in person. We plan for a trip that weekend.

I had sooo much feeling for him but I felt played after our Chicago incident. I felt single until we were officially dating. Plus it‚Äôs a common trick for guys that you meet in the club to tell you that you will be there girlfriend but then they never really ask and then they cheat anyway. My on again off again ex would string me along that way and promise to ask me out and never did. When he told me he was going to ask me out I didn‚Äôt really believe him. 

It‚Äôs the weekend we are supposed to meet and again I had to work Friday, Saturday and drive about an hour to meet halfway because he insisted on this particular town. While I was at work I meet this guy. He was attractive and invites me back to his place Saturday night. I brush him off in person but I give him my contact info. He messages again with the offer. I was in a particular situation because I had work the four shifts again and I was on empty plus I was going to have to sleep on couch because one of the girls threw up in the room I typically sleep in‚Ä¶ I hated sleep on that couch because it implied my body pain and made me absolutely miserable. I didn‚Äôt shower at work because they are community showers. I messaged him back saying I would come but no sex and I would only cuddle. I was drunk and I was basically wanted to stay there so I could have somewhere nice to sleep. I wanted to be happy and not miserable. I know myself.

I go over there to hang out and we cuddle. While we are cuddling he presses me for sex and I decline. Then he starts rejecting me and basically underlying implying if I don‚Äôt he will kick me out. But then I would have to sleep in my car because I didn‚Äôt have money for a room and I had no where to go because the club was closed now. He pressured me into so I did it. We made out and he put it in me and then he pulled out and cummed in his hand. It was over in one second. I didn‚Äôt care and just went to sleep I was exhausted. In the morning he wanted to so while I was half sleep he pulled my pants down and we had sex again. He pumped in me 5 times before he came in his hand again. It was over in less than a minute or two. I felt extremely gross and guilty.

I leave and I call my best friend while I‚Äôm driving to see R. I asked if I should tell him? I felt so bad and she said not to tell him and that I am basically single. However I knew that he might ask me to be his girlfriend. I show up and I was like don‚Äôt touch me. He wanted to give me a hug and stuff but I dodged him. I was like let me shower first. I was deeply embarrassed and felt shame. I took a long shower and then he hugged me and stuff. 

I got ready for our date and in the mirror I saw a vision where I was in a wedding dress and he was in a suit and we got married. It freaked me out considering the night before‚Ä¶  I had never had a vision like that before ever. The night goes on and I never tell him about the night before. At the end of our night he asks me to be his girlfriend. I accept. 

We start dating and everything however I was still in the club. I wouldn‚Äôt quit the club unless the dude I was with was fully supporting me. He declined when I asked after we were dating. So I kept working there but like I said I had no money due to the Japan trip. Once we started dating I felt so guilty talking to other guys at work. I basically couldn‚Äôt do my job and my money plummeted. I was struggling and barely making enough to eat and have gas. I was sleeping at the club and working but I also had to maintain school. I was too embarrassed to ask for help since I had asked before and he declined. I went three weeks without hitting any of my minimums. I was drowning financially. I started to become desperate. I would let some customers touch me down there or finger me for more money but never at the risk of losing my job because that‚Äôs not allowed. I work at a clean club and you could get fired for that. I felt so bad but I was in survival mode. I was so desperate that this guy on the freeway flagged me down and I gave him my contact info in hopes he would visit at my job. It‚Äôs a common method of getting more customers to see you but also dangerous. 

I was struggling so much that my phone was cut off‚Ä¶which meant we couldn‚Äôt have our long evening conversations anymore. I told him I couldn‚Äôt afford my phone bill right now and that he was going to have to contact me another way. He offered to pay my phone bill and did. Soon he told me that he hated me in the club and that he would take care of me. So I quit the club which was very scary for me but i trusted him. 

I quit the club and start focusing on healing my childhood trauma and sexual assault i experienced in my past. Our relationship was perfect and he felt like my other half. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. We were so in love. It was summer for me but he had work in DC and would see me on the weekends. My whole life I had been the club every weekend so it was a transition getting out of that lifestyle. It was more of a transition to be fully dependent on someone when I was so use to having my own money. 

That summer we went to my mom‚Äôs house where he asked for my hand in marriage and my mom approved. We were so happy and in love but then He had a work conference in Virginia. He invited me along and I went with him. During the trip, I got drunk and felt guilty about the situation before we started dating that I broke down and told him. He was extremely hurt. I cried my eyes out and he was very angry and upset. When I originally told him I left details out because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him and felt like it wasn‚Äôt important. I felt like he was going to leave me. I was anxious and scared because I loved him. Trust was broken. Then he asked if I was willing to do anything to rebuild our trust and I said yes. 

I should mention that he works for the government and has training in integrations and stuff. Over the next months, he started asking questions constantly and it felt like a constant integration. He had also piece together parts I had left out and realized it was the night before he asked me to be his girlfriend. He would ask me the same questions over and over again. Our late night conversations turned into us discussing everything about my past and what happened. I would tell him things and he wouldn‚Äôt believe me. He asking me about my past and then turning around and saying I‚Äôm lying. The mental exhaustion is an understatement. Months of this go by and I feel myself growing distant and resentful. I told him how he‚Äôs actions were making me feel but he would bring up how I said I would do anything. So I continued with it. I started dreading the late night conversations that I once loved. When I think we turned a new leaf it would all come crumbling down. I said that maybe we should go to counseling but he declined. He couldn‚Äôt get over that I slept with someone before we dated. I took full responsibility and I knew I created this mess so I was dealing with it. 

It felt like he turned into a whole different person. But when we were physically together we loved each other but when we were away from each other for work we fought constantly. I grew weary feeling like he was going to marry me anyway and our relationship was falling apart. He just wanted to talk things through but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore. He started attacking each other and he would blame me for all of this. 

However we still loved each other, and we had plans for having a child together because it fit within the timeline we had together. Even though I wanted to model and wait until I was 25-28 I set aside how I felt and decided to get pregnant. When we were trying for our baby things between us got better. I ended up getting pregnant and I‚Äôm currently about 8 weeks. Once I told him I was pregnant I panicked because we aren‚Äôt officially married yet and I was super insecure and felt like he was going to leave me. 

I should add that the months while we were talking about my past and stuff he tried to leave me. I begged on the floor for him to stay and wouldn‚Äôt let him leave. I threw all my pride away and wanted him. I‚Äôm talking the hands on leg dragging down the hallway because I didn‚Äôt want him to go. Then he said he would stay and never leave.

Fast forward now we are more distant than ever. I agreed to have the baby now because he said he would be home with me but he still in DC working. I gave him my personal journal in an effort to build trust but he used it as ammunition to attack me when he got frustrated. I am no saint when I felt like he was attacking me I would start attacking him. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant things got worst. He talks about leaving me every week and I have anxious attachment and I feel even more vulnerable dealing with this alone. I want us to be happy and in love like we once were but I the constant questioning and not accepting the answers I give and the rehashing my past is pushing me so far away. The trying to leave me every week is making me not care anymore. 

No one really know what‚Äôs going on. I haven‚Äôt told anyone about what‚Äôs really going on except my therapist. My therapist just supports me and says It will get better. When I speak to my best friend about it she says that my past doesn‚Äôt matter and that I was technically single but when I say that to him it makes him furious and he feel like I‚Äôm justified in my actions. I don‚Äôt feel justified in my actions and feel regret about that situation. I feel like I have no where to turn. 

We both want to be with each other. That we have a church retreat planned to hopefully help our relationship and now family. If you read this far I‚Äôm asking for advice on how to fix our relationship and rebuild trust. I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs too far gone. I love him even despite the blockages we had I still wanted to have this baby and so does he. We both want to fix things before our child gets here but currently I feel lost.
