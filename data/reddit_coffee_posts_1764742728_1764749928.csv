Let's talk about the myth of the ""grand gesture."" We often think that to change our lives, we need a massive, earth-shattering overhaul. A complete reinvention overnight. But honestly? That's overwhelming and rarely sticks.

The real magic, the kind that actually creates lasting **joy and success**, is in the **tiny tweaks**. The 1% changes that seem almost insignificant in the moment.

Think about it. That feeling of ""I'll do it tomorrow"" is a killer. The momentum never builds. But what if you started **TODAY** with something ridiculously small?

*   **The ""One-Minute"" Rule:** If a task takes less than 60 seconds (hanging up your jacket, putting a dish in the dishwasher, answering a quick text), just do it. Don't let it pile up. This single tweak reclaims so much mental energy.
*   **""Hydrate First"":** Before your coffee, before you scroll, drink one glass of water. It's a tiny win that tells your body and brain, ""I'm taking care of you first.""
*   **""Future Self"" Kindness:** Spend 5 minutes before bed tidying one small area. Your kitchen counter, your desk. Future You will wake up to less chaos and will be eternally grateful.

These aren't life hacks that require a new planner or a fancy app. They are micro-habits that build on each other. That's where the **HUGE impact** comes from. You start proving to yourself, one tiny action at a time, that you're the kind of person who follows through. The confidence that builds is insane. 🚀

But let's be real, sometimes the biggest 'tweak' we need is in our mindset or how we handle our emotions. It's not always about a physical action. Sorting through the mental clutter and figuring out *why* we procrastinate or feel stuck can be the hardest part. If you're struggling with the 'how' and need a structured way to handle the emotional side of self-improvement, I've found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a personal roadmap.

It's all about making things easier for ourselves, not harder.

So, I'm curious. What's one tiny tweak you've made in your life that had a surprisingly big impact? Let's share some ideas. ✨",1,1764749085.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I need some advice. For the past 5 months I’ve gotten into a bad habit of going to cafés all the time. I go at least three times a day. I start my day in a café and sometimes I end it there too. I’m a freelancer, so this is starting to really affect my work.

The problem is that a lot of people I know also go to the same cafés. So even when I tell myself I’ll just go for 10 minutes to grab a coffee and come back to my office, I end up staying 2 or 3 hours talking. And the worst part is that I can’t even work there and. I get zero focus.

Has anyone been through this? How did you break the habit or reduce it? Any tips on how to stay disciplined and actually work from home or the office?

In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about kdrama production and broadcast process, check out our FAQ for even more information.

If you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.

**Why Do Kdramas Have Different English Titles?**

English titles of dramas can be one of the following types:

>* **Official English Title:** an official English title determined by the production company/broadcast station
>
>* **Literal Translation:** a literal translation of the official Korean title (most often the official English title) 
>
>* **Alternate Translation:** an alternate translation of the official Korean title
>
>* **Alternate Title Translation:** a translation of an alternate Korean title (sometimes the initial working title)
>
>* **Alternate Title Specific to Stream Source:** certain streaming sites have alternate titles for dramas

We advise checking the drama title on a resource such as [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) for alternate titles. 

**How Many Episodes And How Long Is Each Episode?**

Most kdramas are between 12 to 52 episodes long with each episode being around 1 hour long. **Notable exception:** tvN shows have a tendency for 1hr+ episodes, especially for the newer shows. (Background: This trend was started with Reply 1997 which started with breezy ~35 min long episodes but as the drama snowballed in popularity, its episode lengths kept expanding until its final episodes were 1hr+.)

**What's With The 16 vs 32 Episodes?**

Due to laws regarding advertising, some broadcasters have split up their drama episodes into two halves so every two ~30-minute episode would comprise the traditional 1-hour long episode. Thus what would be the typical 16 episodes are now 32 episodes.

**What Types Of Kdramas Are There?**

Korean dramas can be categorized into 4 categories based on their form/length:

>* **Daily Dramas** (30 min episodes, usually 100+ episodes in length)
>
>* **Miniseries** (mid-length dramas, 12-20 hours long)
>
>* **Serial/Family/Weekend Dramas** (long-form dramas)
>
>* **Web Dramas**

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_what_are_korean_dramas.3F)

**What's The Difference Between Pre-Produced and Live-Production?**

Kdramas are generally produced by production companies in conjunction with the production arm of the broadcasting station. Kdramas are generally live-produced, meaning that the drama is being filmed as it is airing.

>**Pre-Produced:** Where the drama has completely finished filming and all after production work prior to its airing. Most kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting channels (free to air and cable channels) are ***not*** pre-produced though there are exceptions. In contrast, most kdramas produced for the streaming platforms (Wavve, TVING, Netflix) are pre-produced.
>
>**Live-Production:** Most kdramas are filmed as they are broadcast. While all kdramas began filming before its premiere date, most dramas are still filming during its broadcast run, with some dramas still filming in the hours before its finale broadcast. This means that screenwriters may be writing or adjusting the script depending on viewer feedback. 

**Do Kdramas Have Teams of Screenwriters?**

Generally only the head screenwriter(s) is credited for a drama but most screenwriters have assistants. Kdramas do not have screenwriter teams common to western/American shows because kdramas are generally not multi-season continuations that go on for years and years.

**What Are Korea's Major Broadcast Channels?**

>**Free-to-air**: KBS (public broadcaster), SBS, MBC
>
>**Cable**: tvN, OCN, JTBC, TV Chosun, MBN, Channel A

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_korean_broadcast_stations)

**What Is A Typical Drama Promotional Cycle?**

A drama's promotional cycle typically starts with the announcement of the project, which is often accompanied by initial casting news. Next, the initial script reading takes place and pictures are often released from this event to drum up interest in the drama. Once the filming begins, pictures taken during filming and coffee truck pictures are often shared. Usually shortly following the start of filming, official promotional material is releases, which includes drama poster(s), character posters, and teasers.

Before broadcast starts, there is generally an official press conference where the director (PD), the main cast members, and sometimes the writer will meet with the press to talk about the drama.

Before premiere or during broadcast (and sometimes after broadcast has finished), the cast members (together or individually) may appear on various variety shows to promote the drama.

[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_promotional_cycle_of_a_kdrama)

**What Is PPL? (Product Placement)**

PPL stands for ""Product Placement"", which is a form of embedded advertising -- an advertising technique used by companies to subtly promote their products through a non-traditional advertising technique, usually through appearances in film, television, or other media. In short, everything worn, eaten, or used in dramas may be advertising something. Oftentimes, the dialogue will make it clear that something is PPL and is being advertised by lauding the advantages of the PPL product. 

> Why Do All Characters Have Same Car/Phone/Vacuum/Clothes? **PPL**
>
> Why Do They All Eat At Subway/Quiznos/BBQ Chicken/That One Coffee Shop? **PPL**
>
> Is PPL Possible In Historical Kdramas AKA Sageuks? Yes, it's possible. See [this post](/r/KDRAMA/comments/ho8z5i/a_question_about_product_placement_in_historical/) for insight and examples.

**What Are OSTs?**

OST stands for **Original Soundtrack**. All kdramas have their own original soundtracks (OSTs) -- songs specifically created for the kdrama. How many songs there are depends on the kind of drama it is. Generally, most dramas will have one or two theme songs that get used frequently. OST tracks are generally released as the drama broadcasts, they are **not** released all at once upon the premiere of a drama. Check our [Drama Resources](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/dramaresources) for where to find more information on OST releases.

Some dramas also use previously existing songs -- these generally are not included in the OST, though new original covers of old songs specifically made for the kdrama generally are included as part of the OST.

Sometimes the background music of the kdrama available on a legal streaming site will differ from the version broadcast on Korean television due to copyright and licensing issues. [Here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs#wiki_what.27s_with_the_music.3F) is a slightly more in depth explanation of why music is changed.

**Why Are Things Blurred?**

Oftentimes there will be things blurred in a kdrama. Blurring usually happens due to broadcasting regulations either due to copyright issues or the manner of the content being shown. 

If no one is being harmed or killed, the blurring is likely due to copyright issues -- whatever is being shown does not have the right licenses to be shown/streamed everywhere so they are blurred out. This is done by post-production. Another form of blurring you may see is that brands and logos are blacked out by tape or otherwise covered within dramas so that they are not shown. These are generally done during filming and not via post-production.

If someone is being harmed or killed: broadcasting rules require blurring of weapons and other tools being used in a manner intended to hurt someone. This means that while a kitchen knife used for chopping vegetable is not blurred, if later that same knife is used for stabbing someone, it will be blurred. Note that these broadcasting rules apply only to kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting stations (free to air or cable ones). This means that movies will not be blurred. Additionally, kdramas available exclusively on streaming services (Wavve, TVING, Netflix, Viki, etc.) are also **not** subject to these regulations and do not have to be blurred.  

**Where Is This Filming Location?**

To find information about a filming location, try [Korean Dramaland](https://koreandramaland.com/). You can search by a specific drama (to see the locations used in that drama) or by a location (to see all the dramas that have filmed there). They also include overseas locations. They are a still growing site and constantly adding new locations, you can contribute to it too to help it grow!

**Is That A Cameo Or Something More?**

The concept of cameos is very well established in kdrama-land. Actors will often make special appearances (cameos) for directors, writers, and actors they've worked with in the past in their newest works. Friends within the industry will often do this too.

When the story fits, they may cameo as a previous character. Other times, they will cameo as a completely new character, it really just depends on the situation. There's no need to force two stories together/make up theories, just treat them as ***cameos***.

**Is There A Season 2?**

In general Korean dramas are not multi-season, so do not expect a second season unless:

* It was announced at the start that the drama was envisioned as multiple seasons (think Netflix productions like Kingdom, Arthdal Chronicles, etc.)

***or***

* It was a very popular procedural (crime, forensics, legal). For example: Voice, Partners For Justice, Vampire Prosecutor, God’s Quiz, etc..

Posts asking about subsequent seasons of aired dramas are prohibited. All speculations about subsequent seasons of aired dramas should be made in one of our [FFA threads](/r/KDRAMA/?f=flair_name%3A%22FFA%20Thread%22).

**Where Is The Sex?/Why So Chaste?**

Different culture and broadcasting regulations. ***But also:***

Ever notice a scene where the leads are either in bed or heading towards the bedroom or hugging and then the scene cuts to black or cuts off and all of a sudden the next scene seems to have been sometime after or in the morning?

That's the kdrama way of ***hinting*** that the viewer should be using their imagination right then.

Also, anytime you hear a joke or talk about how strong a male lead's back and/or waist is, the *implication* is how good he will be in bed.

There are a lot of hints in most dramas that involve a relationship, it's just that kdramas are family friendly so they are not visually explicit. You can watch the same drama as your grandparents and your younger siblings but only those in the know will *nod* and *snicker* at the right times.

So if you see something that you think implies a couple having sex, you are probably picking up the right cues. The visually explicit stuff is saved for their movies.",1,1764748833.0,KDRAMA,0,1.0,False

1pcydj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1pcydj1/anybody_have_similar_sleep_issues_insomnia_with/,Anybody have similar sleep issues? Insomnia with daytime sleepiness,"I've always had sleep issues, insomnia at night time and feeling drowsy during the day. To preface I have CFS/ME diagnosed, but now my doctor wants me to do a sleep study. So gradually I've quit sleep meds that could cause drowsiness during the day and I've noticed.. exactly zero affect.   
  
Which has made me reflect and remember how throughout my teenage/early adulthood life I would always be tired no matter what, always late for school, always taking naps. I thought I was depressed, which at points we all have been, but even outside of depression I would never feel fully awake.   
  
Towards the nighttime I would mostly always get insomnia, if I tried to go to sleep before 12am I was always guaranteed to wake up throughout the night every couple of hours from different dreams/nightmares. (Which, my dreams have always been very vivid almost like watching a movie, only if they weren't majority nightmares/I used to talk in my sleep or so my dad said apparently within a few hours of falling asleep/I've also sleepwalked at some points when I was younger)  
  
I'm slowly beginning to realise that despite all my implemented efforts in regards to sleep, it just never works. When I was younger I would try and do the ""stay awake until night so that you'll fall asleep early and reset your sleep cycle"", but there was nothing to reset to and I would always end up involuntarily falling asleep during those attempts to find myself sleeping 24 hours and waking up in the middle of the day.   
  
I feel incredibly disappointed realising this has genuinely been my life for almost 2 decades, never awake, but never truly sleeping.   
  
Today I woke up to a sleep paralysis to top it all off. I already feel like I am fighting to stay awake and thinking whether I should take a nap (I've been awake for around 2 hours at the point of me writing this). I woke up several times throughout the night as well.   
I can't remember a time where I woke up ""refreshed"". I have done most everything to help with my sleep (well except the sleep study).  
   
I feel like I've blamed myself for this for the longest time, I remember doctors screaming at me when I was younger to stop taking naps or another doctor saying I was just subconsciously avoiding life by being sleepy. Which I believed at the time since I had 100% trust in them to know my body better than I did, even though the only thing I loved to do was learn and do new things. Now I sort of regret trusting these doctors, one even drummed his chest with saying he could fix my fatigue with a simple protocol.   
  
I've tried asking for help for the sleep paralysis and got the ""just sleep on your side"" which also didn't work.   
  
I feel like I've been waiting to feel awake for the majority of my life. If this is part of having ME that is ""fine"", but this isn't and hasn't been going away at any point in my life despite my level of happiness with my life. The only time I've felt mildly awake was with vyvanse for adhd.   
  
It's also sort of tragicomic to realise that even if I cut out my naps, it still wouldn't affect my insomnia at all, all I ended up doing was fighting to stay awake the whole day and still not being able to sleep at night. Having or cutting out coffee had the same effect. Sleep hygiene, same effect.   
  
I dont understand how you can have none of the more basic things working in your favour and still be disregarded since childhood/teenage years for any issues.   
  
The lyrics from the MGM ""little dark age"" have sort of haunted me with the ""Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away"", because no matter how much or hard I've tried to run or hide from these issues always finding another thing to try, the reality of my situation has never truly changed.

1pcycun,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1pcycun/finally_bought_a_robot_vacuum_so_i_can_walk/,Finally bought a Robot Vacuum so I can walk barefoot at home. Best decision ever?,"Just wanted to share a quick ""long-term"" (1 month) update after finally pulling the trigger on a robot vacuum (Roborock Pro model).

For context: I live alone in a small 2-bedroom apartment (60m²) with a mix of hard floors and carpets.

**Why I bought it:**

* **Anxiety:** I hated the pressure of having a maid come over bi-weekly.
* **Sensory:** I just wanted to walk barefoot without feeling grit/dust.

**The Shopping Struggle:** I spent way too long overthinking this. I almost bought a cheap budget one, but reviews warned me they are just ""toys with a mop."" I also considered the super high-end ones (Dreame/Ecovacs flagships), but realized I don't cook enough or have pets to justify the price tag. I settled on a mid-range Roborock because it fit my aesthetic and budget (approx. 2000 RMB range).

**The Experience (1 Month In):**

* **Week 1 was rough:** It got tangled in cables and stuck everywhere. I thought I made a mistake.
* **Week 2 onwards:** It magically learned the house. Zero incidents.
* **The Barefoot Life:** It runs every day while I'm at work. Coming home to a perfectly clean floor is underrated. I can drop clothes on the floor, spill coffee grounds in the kitchen (robot cleans it up), and I've basically stopped hiring the cleaning service.

Since I rent, I couldn't install the automatic water hookup, but refilling the tank once a week is honestly fine.

If you are on the fence about getting one because you live alone or think your place is ""too small,"" just do it. It’s a game changer for the ""barefoot lifestyle.""

His rationale? I’m single.

1pcy8j8,https://i.redd.it/3nxj1nv52y4g1.png,Wedding Eve Betrayal,"Wedding Eve Betrayal - On the eve of our wedding, I discovered the video: my fiancé being intimate with my best friend. The timestamp exposed his lie—dated to the very night I lay alone in my hospital bed. “The wedding,” I declared as I turned away, “is over.”

Chapter 1

I dug an old camcorder out of the storage closet.

The moment I pressed the power button, a girl's smiling face filled the screen. It stabbed at my eyes, and my breath caught in my throat.

""William.""

""We have to be together forever.""

My heart clenched. I watched as William tapped the girl's nose and made a promise.

""Okay. I'll be with Harper forever.""

My hand trembled, and the camcorder fell to the floor. William's voice echoed from the small speaker.

""If I ever break this promise, I hope I never find happiness in my entire life.""

A bitter ache spread through my chest, and my eyes burned. I still couldn't believe it.

The woman William had sworn to love for a lifetime—Harper—was my best friend.

...

I sat in the living room, frozen.

My hands were shaking so hard they'd gone numb. Even with the heat cranked all the way up, a bone-deep chill had taken hold of me, and I couldn't stop shivering. But still, I tortured myself, my eyes glued to the screen as William led Harper by the hand into a hotel room.

He pushed her down onto the bed and asked her.

""Is this okay?""

Harper just smiled, wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling him down for a kiss.

""I'm yours.""

Their intimacy was a blade twisting in my heart. The pain was so unbearable, so all-consuming, that even feeling it felt like a sin.

I remembered the year William and I first got together. I told him all about my best friend, the one I'd grown up with. I'd even laughed and said,

""She's basically my family. My whole support system.""

""If you want things to go smoothly with us, you'll have to win her over.""

Back then.

I was so full of joy. I looked at William, and he placated me with the same gentle tone he used with Harper.

""Mission accepted,"" he'd promised.

I remembered the day we met up with her. William was holding a gift basket full of snacks, and we were sitting in a coffee shop. The first time he saw Harper, his expression went completely blank for a second. But he recovered quickly, smiling as he introduced himself.

""Hi, I'm Grace's boyfriend.""

Harper, who was always so sweet and never gave strangers a hard time, took one look at William and said something incredibly rude.

""You're not good enough for Grace.""

Ignoring my mortified expression, Harper grabbed her coffee and threw it in William's face. Then she yanked my hand and hissed,

""You can't date just any piece of trash. For God's sake, have some standards!""

The day ended in disaster.

I could never understand where Harper's hostility toward him came from. Not until now. On the screen, after they'd made love, Harper was curled up in William's arms.

""Will you ever love someone else in the future?"" she asked him.

William didn't hesitate.

""Never.""

""I only love Harper.""

The tears finally broke free, a tidal wave I couldn't hold back anymore, threatening to drown me.

Just then, the front door opened. A switch clicked, and the living room was flooded with light. William's voice called out.

""Honey? Why are you sitting in the dark?""

He walked closer and saw my red, swollen eyes. He immediately dropped his briefcase, kneeling in front of me and cupping my face in his hands.

""Why are you crying?""

""Who upset you?""

""Tell me,"" he said, his voice so gentle, so full of a love that seemed real—a love so careful that he was studying my every expression. ""I'll make them pay for it, okay?""

""Don't cry anymore, honey.""

William pulled me into his arms, cooing at me like he always did, as if I were a child.

""You just tell me who hurt you.""

""I'll destroy them for you.""

Chapter 2

William's embrace was warm. His familiar scent used to be the source of all my security, but now, breathing it in again, a sharp pain pricked at my chest. The ache made a question slip out unconsciously.

""William, do you love me?""

My voice was a thin, fragile whisper.

""William, when you love me, could you fall in love with someone else?""

I felt his body stiffen, but only for half a second. Then he laughed, kissed the corner of my mouth, and brushed his finger over the tip of my nose.

""Of course I love you.""

""Honey, we've been married for three years. Why are you still asking such silly questions after all this time?""

William looked me right in the eyes, his expression serious.

""If I didn't love you,""

""why would I have married you? Right?""

""You silly girl.""

I looked at his earnest face and thought back to when we'd only been together for a few months. Someone had seen William leaving a hotel with another woman. I remembered how my friend had sounded on the phone, practically hysterical as she yelled.

""Grace!""

""I'm keeping an eye on them for you!""

""Get over here, now!""

""We'll catch these two cheating scumbags red-handed.""

The news that my boyfriend was cheating sent me into a tailspin. It felt like I'd been run over by a truck. As my mind went blank, I instinctively dialed Harper Evans's number and sobbed into the phone.

""Harper.""

""William's cheating on me.""

""Harper, what am I supposed to do?""

I sat in the back of an Uber, crying, on my way to meet my friend at the hotel. I wanted to catch William in the act, but when I got there, I stumbled upon the sight of Harper slapping William across the face. I froze, stunned, and heard Harper say:

""Don't think you can buy me off with a few gifts and get me to plead your case. I'm telling you, no chance in hell.""

Then, it was as if Harper and William had only just noticed me.

Harper grabbed my arm, her voice a mix of anger and frustration.

""This asshole asked me to meet him at the hotel, said you were here too. I thought you were! Turns out, he bought me gifts to try and butter me up, hoping I'd put in a good word for him with you.""

""There's no cheating going on,"" Harper said, turning to my friend with an accusatory tone. ""Do you really think I would steal Grace's man?""

""What a joke.""

I felt so guilty about that incident for years, like I owed Harper and had betrayed William's love for me. For the next two years, William would always laugh about it whenever it came up.

""You and your jealousy. What were you even thinking? That I'd actually cheat on you with the woman who slapped me?""

""If it weren't for you, do you really think I'd give her the time of day?""

Every time he brought it up,

I'd feel a pang of guilt, so much so that I'd have to spend ages reassuring him and telling him over and over again how wonderful Harper really was.

Turns out, William had always understood just how ""wonderful"" Harper was. Just like in the video, where William pushed a sobbing Harper away, telling her:

""We can't see each other anymore.""

Harper just lunged forward and threw her arms around him.

""Then just one last time.""

One last time.

It happened three days before our wedding. I'd been rushed to the hospital with a nasty case of gastroenteritis. I was on an IV drip all night, but I couldn't get ahold of my fiancé. Even my best friend was completely MIA. My coworker, who was keeping me company, had joked at the time.

""You know what they say, Grace...""

""Gotta watch your back. Especially around the bestie.""

I was too weak to talk, but I still retorted sharply.

""The entire world could betray me.""

""Harper never would.""

Chapter 3

My cheeks were burning.

I felt everything I believed in starting to crumble as I watched William, who had just made me dinner and was now tidying up the house. I had to ask.

""William.""

""Can you tell me about your first love?""

The thing is.

William had told me before.

He'd had a first love that ended badly; she cheated on him, and he caught her in the act. Devastated, he broke up with her. He told me.

""Grace.""

""Because I know what it feels like to be betrayed, I would never, ever put you through that. I'll always cherish what we have.""

And I believed him.

Now, as I watched William finish cleaning and sit down beside me, smiling as he leaned in for a kiss, the scene from the video flashed through my mind: Harper, crying as she made him promise.

""William, even if we break up.""

""You can only have me in your heart, not Grace.""

""William.""

""Promise me you'll never fall in love with Grace.""

""Okay?""

William's breath was on my skin, his lips just about to touch mine, when a wave of nausea churned in my stomach. I couldn't hold it back. I bolted for the bathroom and threw up violently, heaving until only bitter bile came up and tears streamed uncontrollably down my face. Through it all, I heard William’s worried voice next to me.

""Honey, are you feeling sick?""

""Honey.""

""I'm taking you to the doctor.""

William draped his jacket over my shoulders and was about to scoop me into his arms when his phone, lying on the bed, started to ring. The familiar ringtone sent a shiver through me. It was her. Harper.

If this had been before.

I would have told William not to worry about me and to answer Harper's call.

I would have told him not to keep Harper waiting, that since she wasn't his biggest fan, it had to be an emergency.

I would have insisted that he make Harper his priority, even over me.

But now, I just watched in silence as his expression shifted. The subtle changes I'd never noticed before were suddenly so obvious. I'd been blind to it for all these years, a complete fool. Only now did I realize it: William was anxious about Harper.

He set me down on the bed and picked up his phone, giving me a conflicted look.

""I'm just worried if I don't answer,"" he said.

""She'll try to stir up trouble between us again, telling you to divorce me.""

""Honey, just a sec, okay?""

William didn't wait for my answer. He walked out of the bedroom and even closed the door behind him. So it had been this blatant, this out in the open, all along. And I never noticed a thing. \*How could I have been so stupid? So naive?\* I trusted them too much, and I gave them every opportunity to hurt me.

Through the door, I could hear Harper's muffled sobs, and then William's voice.

""I'm on my way now, don't worry.""

I heard him comforting her.

""Don't be scared. Give me ten minutes.""

Then, I sat back on the bed, and a moment later, William came back in, his face a mask of annoyance as he started complaining.

""Your best friend is so much drama. Honestly, sometimes I just want to block her number. She said she got rear-ended, and now the cops and the other driver are giving her a hard time and she won't stop crying.""

""I don't get why, of all the people in the world, you had to be friends with her. She's so high-maintenance. And you even made me give her a custom ringtone.""

""Seriously, I feel like all I do is clean up her messes.""

He was saying all the right words of complaint and frustration, but the whole time, the corners of his mouth were turned up in a slight smile. It was a smile he didn't even seem aware of, one that started deep in his eyes and threatened to spill over. He said.

""Honey, I'm gonna go handle this. You just lie down and get some rest, okay? I'll be back as fast as I can. If you're still not feeling well when I get back, I'll take you to the hospital. You just hang tight.""

Chapter 4

I watched William grab his jacket, ready to leave. I knew I was supposed to do the usual—tell him to drive safe, remind him not to get into it with Harper. She was my person, after all, and for my sake, he should cut her some slack.

But today...

I just stared at his back, and he felt like a total stranger. So much of a stranger that when I heard the click of the front door, I suddenly threw myself out of bed. I ran out of my room, barefoot, and rushed into the living room to call out to him.

""William.""

I watched him stand there by the entrance, his face clouded with confusion.

My heart shattered, piece by piece.

He didn't even notice I wasn't wearing shoes. All he cared about was leaving, but I still couldn't let it go.

""Can you please not go?""

My voice was laced with one last shred of hope that he would finally understand what really mattered. I looked at him, feeling pathetic.

""Please? Don't go?""

My eyes started to burn, and a dull ache spread through my chest, so tight I could barely breathe. But I didn't get the concern or the favoritism he always used to show me. He just frowned, his face etched with annoyance.

""If I don't go, who will?""

""What, you'd rather see her get hauled off by the cops? Would that make you happy?""

""Grace.""

""Let's be reasonable, okay? It's not like I'm not coming back.""

And then he was gone.

In the empty living room, the only sounds were my own ragged breaths and the buzz of a new text from Harper.

""Grace, I'm so, so sorry. I seriously had no one else to call, so I just had to borrow your husband for a bit.""

A roar filled my ears.

I felt my whole world come crashing down. The love and friendship I'd been so proud of were utterly destroyed today. My mind went blank as I grabbed my car keys, bolted for the parking garage, and sped toward the scene of the accident—toward this failure, this absurd joke my life had become, ready to put an end to this relationship once and for all.

By the time I stopped at the crash site, I saw Harper sobbing uncontrollably in William's arms while he held her close, murmuring.

""I'm here.""

""Don't be afraid.""

I watched William arguing forcefully with the other driver, calling Harper his love, his wife. I heard William declare,

""You all need to apologize to my wife. She's been traumatized. If you don't handle this properly, we'll see you in court.""

Then he said,

""I can take being treated unfairly, but my wife can't!""

I watched Harper hide behind him, her eyes filled with an adoring gaze, and my love and friendship were finally reduced to ruins. As the incident was wrapping up, I heard Harper plead with him.

""Can you please not leave? Can you stay with me tonight?""

My nails dug into my palms.

Blood welled up, and the pain was so sharp I thought I would go insane. But then I saw William hesitate... and finally, with a resigned sigh, he said,

""Okay.""

\*Harper, this is the last time I'm letting him choose you.\*

It was just like three days before our wedding.

William had said,

""This is the last time.""

How many more ""last times"" were there between them?

I didn't know, and I didn't care. The only thing I knew was that I was no longer in control. The moment they turned to leave, I rushed in front of him.

Then, I slapped him hard across the face. I looked at his stunned expression and Harper's panicked one, and my voice was cold as I delivered the final blow.

""William.""

""Let's get a divorce.""

I swear half of them treat customers like we're some kind of burden instead of, you know, the people keeping their lights on.

Just had this experience at a local bike shop yesterday. I walk in with a flat tire, and the guy behind the counter literally sighs and rolls his eyes before I even say anything. I'm like ""hey, can you patch this tire?"" and he goes ""we're really busy right now"" while sitting on a stool scrolling his phone. There's literally no one else in the shop.

So I ask when would be a good time to come back, and he just shrugs and says ""maybe try next week."" Next week?? For a basic tire patch?? Then he goes back to his phone like I'm not even there anymore.

The whole interaction felt like I was bothering him by existing. Like dude, you CHOSE to open a business that serves customers. If you hate people this much, just become a hermit or something.

And this isn't a one-off thing. I've had similar experiences at local coffee shops, hardware stores, all kinds of places. What is it about owning a small business that makes people think basic courtesy is optional?

Long story - he gave me his phone to prevent him from texting the drug dealer more (after I begged and cried), I hid it, I gave him mine so he could scroll YouTube and take a hoot for bed, he called his phone instead.  found his phone by grabbing me and I had to hit him twice on his chest to get off of me, I went to call a mutual friend cause I was terrified and he thought it was the cops so he grabbed me again and forced the phone to show him.

1pcy6zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pcy6zr/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

1pcy6t4,https://i.redd.it/8004qayg1y4g1.png,"He didn't cherish me before the divorce; After the divorce, I became the woman he can never wait for again.","Chapter 1

My in-laws insisted on taking me on a trip to celebrate their golden anniversary. They said my husband, Noah, got lucky with me and that from now on, they'd spoil me like their own daughter.

The moment we landed at the airport, a woman stormed over and slapped me across the face.

My in-laws snapped out of their shock and rushed to shield me, only to get caught in the woman's tirade.

“Well, look at you all! A whole family of shameless, trashy home-wreckers. Enjoying the money you got for spreading your legs, are we?!”

The three of us were stunned. A mistress? Me?

“Wow, playing it so cool even when the real wife shows up. Looks like you've got a lot of guys on the side, huh?”

The woman rolled her eyes when she saw us just standing there, frozen.

I tried to stand up, but she twisted my arm behind my back and slammed my face down onto a table.

I couldn't break free, so I yelled, “We are legally married! If you keep this up, you'll be hearing from my lawyer!”

Seeing how defiant we were, the woman's face turned red with rage. She grabbed her purse and started swinging it at my in-laws' heads.

“I've never met anyone so shameless! Let's see how you're gonna seduce my husband after I scratch that face of yours to pieces!”

When we still refused to back down, she whipped out her phone and made a call.

“Babe, there's some woman here who doesn't know her place, insisting she's your wife. You gotta get over here!”

After hanging up, she yanked my hair, pulling my face close to hers.

“You'd better get on your knees and beg for my forgiveness right now. If you do, maybe I'll leave you and those two old-timers in one piece when Noah gets here.”

My in-laws were furious. My father-in-law pointed a shaky finger at her. “We'll see who's begging who for forgiveness!”

The second he said that, Paisley Hansen swung around and slapped him too.

My mother-in-law was stunned, completely frozen.

Paisley, however, recoiled as if she'd just touched something filthy, her face twisted in disgust.

“Oh, I know who you are. Just a bunch of pathetic leeches living off my husband's money!”

“A broke-ass tramp raised by a couple of poor old losers. I guess sleeping your way to the top was the only way you could think of to climb the social ladder, huh?!”

She punctuated her rant by spitting on the ground.

“People like you make me sick just looking at you!”

“You…!”

My in-laws' faces turned beet red with rage. Moving in their elite circles, they had never encountered someone so crude.

People around us were craning their necks to see what was happening, their whispers carrying over.

“What is with that girl? She's the mistress and she brought her parents along? Does she have no shame?!”

“Those two older people look like retired professionals, not like troublemakers. How could they raise a daughter like that?”

“Who knows? They might look respectable, but maybe they're all just trash underneath.”

Seeing the situation, my father-in-law's face hardened. He raised his voice to address the crowd.

“Noah is my son! Harper is our daughter-in-law. In all these years, we have never once heard the name Paisley Hansen! What are you all spreading rumors for?”

Paisley's expression changed. She lunged at my father-in-law, ready to hit him again.

“Who are you calling a liar, you old bastard?! I think you're the ones who don't know what's good for you! The nerve to say something like that… you're all pathological liars, born and bred trash!”

“You've gone way too far!”

I shouted, rushing forward with my mother-in-law to block the crazed Paisley.

Stopped by us, Paisley took an instinctive step back, then theatrically dusted off her sleeves.

“What, you two think you can stop me? You should really know your place!”

Noticing the onlookers were still watching, Paisley smoothed her hair.

Then, with an air of complete confidence, she announced:

“Noah's parents are the richest family in North City. And you two think you're worthy of even passing yourselves off as them?”

“You don't look anything like billionaires! Why don't you find a mirror and take a good look at your broke-ass selves?”

At this, the crowd's chatter grew louder.

“Oh my god. The young one is just as bad as the old ones. So shameless, no self-respect.”

“Exactly. My parents wouldn't even wear clothes that shabby. And they have the nerve to call themselves the richest family?”

“The main thing is, how can a mistress be so bold and self-righteous? Well, I've seen it all now!”

Because my in-laws had been incredibly low-key for years, they rarely appeared in public.

The media also knew better than to take or publish their photos, which meant almost no one knew what the richest family in North City actually looked like.

With the Diaz family's influence, making sure not a single photo of them existed online was as easy as snapping their fingers.

Seeing my in-laws were at a complete loss, I quickly grabbed my phone.

“I have pictures of me and Noah together and a photo of our marriage certificate on my phone! You can't fake that, right?!”

At my words, my in-laws looked at me as if I were their savior.

I unlocked my phone, fuming, and gritted my teeth.

“Let's see if you're still this cocky in a minute.”

Paisley just looked amused, like she was enjoying the show.

“Fine by me. I'd love to see what you can come up with.”

Chapter 2

Without even thinking, I pulled up the photos and shoved the phone at her.

“Look at this!”

Paisley studied the photos, then burst out laughing.

She was laughing so hard she started crying.

My brow furrowed. Paisley snatched the phone from my hand and held it up for everyone to see.

“Hey everyone, come check out her so-called 'proof'! This is hilarious. Do people not even bother to come up with a good lie anymore?”

Curious onlookers crowded around, their gazes turning to me, filled with contempt.

Just as I was about to grab it back to see what was going on, Paisley slammed the phone onto the ground.

“You cheap bitch, even dying a hundred times would be too good for you!”

My in-laws and I exchanged dark looks.

I craned my neck to look and saw that the photo album was filled with nothing but goofy pictures from the trip the three of us took.

I suddenly remembered this was my travel phone, the one I only use for taking pictures on vacation.

I hadn't brought my main phone from home, which meant I didn't have any of my wedding photos with Noah on it.

The pictures I'd just shown them were all of the three of us—not a single one of Noah.

“So what if I grabbed the wrong phone? Does that give you the right to act like this?! Who the hell do you think you are!”

I shot Paisley a nasty look and bent down to pick up my phone.

The next second, a red-soled heel stomped down hard on the back of my hand.

“Who do I think I am?”

Paisley stared down at me, grinding her heel into my hand as she spoke.

“I should be asking you about your attitude. You're the other woman here—don't you think you're getting a little too full of yourself?”

Pain shot through me, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. I tried to pull my hand free, but I couldn't.

“Harper!”

“Stop it! How could you do this to Harper?!”

Seeing this, my in-laws rushed over to help me up.

Before we could even catch our breath, the crowd closed in around us.

A group of middle-aged women at the front started screaming at us.

“How dare you fight back? You're a homewrecker, destroying a family!”

“Exactly! Get out of here with your parents! Just looking at you makes me sick!”

“Go die, you homewrecker! If I were you, I'd go home and hang myself!”

My eyes turned red. Paisley shoved her phone right in my face.

“Take a good look. This is what the real wife looks like. Who the hell are you to challenge me?”

I froze. The screen was filled with intimate photos of Paisley and Noah.

There were pictures of them strolling on the beach during a vacation, playing around in the pool of a luxury apartment, and kissing hand-in-hand on a street corner at dusk.

Looking at them, she seemed more like the “real wife” than I ever was.

I couldn't stop my whole body from shaking.

I couldn't believe it. The woman who kept calling me the other woman… was actually the one my husband was cheating with.

Then what about me? What did my three years of marriage to Noah even mean?

At first, I'd even believed Noah, thinking Paisley was just some psycho.

Tears started streaming down my face before I could stop them. I was in total disbelief.

“Noah… he…”

After seeing the photos, my in-laws stared at each other for a long moment before they finally spoke.

“Noah… how could he do something like this?!”

“How could I have raised a son like that? When I get home… I'm going to kill him!”

But I was still lost in the fact that Noah had cheated on me.

We'd dated for two years and been married for three. For those five years, Noah had been the model boyfriend, the model husband.

I married him precisely because he was such a good, upstanding person with strong morals.

What was any of that now? My husband had been cheating on me this whole time?

Smack!

A slap from Paisley snapped me back to reality. I stumbled sideways, and my mother-in-law caught me, her voice choked with emotion.

“Harper, our Noah has wronged you!”

My father-in-law was furious.

“Why are you hitting her? Do that again and we're calling the cops!”

Paisley rolled her eyes so hard I thought they'd fall out.

“Call the cops? What gives you the nerve, you old geezer? Go ahead, call them! Let's see who they think is in the right here!”

“You're really committed to this act of being Noah's parents, aren't you? I've gotta say, I admire your dedication.”

My father-in-law was so angry he clutched his chest, and I quickly spoke up.

“Dad… it's okay, don't get worked up! You know your heart isn't strong!”

I stumbled forward a few steps and glared at Paisley, gritting my teeth.

“Paisley, I have nothing to say to you. We'll see who the real homewrecker is when Noah gets here.”

“Let's see how you're going to get out of this then!”

Hearing this only made Paisley angrier. She started to step forward in her high heels.

“...What did you say?!”

Just then, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a sudden glimpse of an elegant figure rushing over anxiously.

When she got closer and saw the scene, she froze.

“Harper, what's going on here?!”

Chapter 3

""Hailey!""

My eyes lit up. It was my best friend, Hailey Hunt.

For a second, I forgot all about my injuries and screamed for her.

""I'm over here! Hailey, I'm right here!""

Hailey's eyes met mine, and she started to walk over.

But then her gaze flickered to the strange looks on the faces of the crowd, and she froze.

""You...""

Before she could finish, Paisley spotted her and grinned.

""Hailey!""

She scurried over and linked her arm through Hailey's affectionately.

""Girl, you're finally here! I was waiting for you so we could go shopping.""

I just stood there, completely stunned.

My best friend of over a decade... since when was she Paisley's ""girl""?!

Paisley's eyes darted back and forth between us. ""Wait, why did she call you Hailey just now? Do you two know each other?"" she asked with fake confusion.

Hailey paused for a beat, then smiled at Paisley.

""Sorry to keep you waiting, the traffic was a nightmare. As for her... I guess you could say we sort of know each other.""

The second Paisley heard that, she immediately pointed at us and launched into her version of the story.

Staring at the pathetic state I was in, the shock Hailey had shown when our eyes first met vanished, replaced by a smug, gloating expression. She even clicked her tongue twice.

""Ugh, how can someone be so trashy? Paisley, I'm not gonna lie, I actually used to be friends with her.""

""Back when we were still friends, I tried to talk some sense into her, but it was useless. She was dead set on being a gold-digging homewrecker. I can't believe she's actually trying to break up someone's relationship now. Thank God I cut her off ages ago!""

""Hailey...""

My lips trembled as I stared at her, my face a mask of disbelief.

""Cut me off? When did you ever...""

Before I could finish, my mother-in-law's terrified shriek cut through the air.

""William!""

With a sickening thud, my father-in-law collapsed. My mother-in-law rushed to his side, shaking him frantically.

""William! Wake up! Please, wake up!""

""Dad!""

My heart lurched, and I scrambled forward to help.

The old man's face was chalky white as he clutched his chest, gasping desperately for air.

I knew instantly his heart condition was acting up.

My father-in-law had undergone heart bypass surgery last year and still hadn't fully recovered.

""Does anyone have nitroglycerin pills?!""

My own phone was shattered, so I screamed at the crowd.

""He's having a heart attack! Does anyone have nitroglycerin pills?!""

My in-laws' phones were dead, and mine was broken. I had no choice but to beg the people around us.

""Please! If you don't have medicine, can you just call 911?! Someone is going to die!""

The crowd just stared at us coldly. Not a single person moved to help.

In a blind panic, I dropped to my knees. My pride and dignity were gone; I could only plead.

""I'm begging you, please! My father-in-law is really dying!""

Seeing me so pitiful and groveling, Paisley and Hailey looked absolutely triumphant.

""Nobody help them! Let this be a lesson to everyone about what happens when you try to wreck a family!""

""Exactly! Did they really think they could do something so horrible and get away with it? This is karma!""

With just a few words, those two had trapped everyone on a moral high ground.

I shot them a venomous glare before bowing my head to the ground, begging relentlessly.

""Please! Even if you don't have medicine, just call 911! He's going to die if we wait any longer!""

Seeing this, my mother-in-law started crying and begging along with me.

Clink.

At my breaking point, a small glass bottle was suddenly tossed in front of me.

My eyes widened. It was nitroglycerin!

I looked up and saw it was an old man who had thrown it. I thanked him profusely.

""Thank you! Thank you so much!""

The old man just waved his hand, his face still full of disdain.

""Wicked people get what they deserve. Next time, don't drag your parents into your dirty business. I'm just doing my good deed for the day.""

After saying his piece, he turned and left.

Seeing that he himself was an old man leaning unsteadily on a cane, no one else could really say anything.

I didn't have time to stop him. I quickly gave the medicine to my father-in-law and gently smoothed down the front of his shirt.

""Dad? How are you feeling?!""

My mother-in-law held her breath beside me. After a long moment, my father-in-law slowly came to, sighing as he grit his teeth.

""That... that wretched girl. I'm so... so furious.""

But before I could even feel a moment of relief, I heard a familiar voice.

""Paisley, what's going on here?""

Chapter 4

The vicious look on Paisley Hansen's face vanished the moment she saw him.

“Noah\~”

She rushed over and threw herself into Noah's arms, pointing right at me.

“Babe, it's this little bitch! She keeps insisting she's your wife, and it's driving me crazy!”

I was kneeling on the floor, covered head to toe in coffee stains and grime. Blood was starting to seep from a cut on my forehead. I was an absolute wreck.

Airport paramedics had arrived earlier and were clustered around my in-laws, checking them over.

They were now a good distance away from me, and I was once again swallowed by the crowd, so they hadn't noticed Noah's arrival yet.

“Noah…”

I tried to stagger to my feet, but Paisley slapped me hard across the face.

“Did I say you could get up?! A bitch like you stays on her knees when she talks!”

A sharp pain shot through me, and I spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva.

It hurts… It hurts so much.

“Noah, my hand hurts from hitting her! She's making me so damn mad!”

Noah held her dotingly, gently tapped the tip of her nose, and smiled.

“What's all this? Your makeup's a little smudged.”

He didn't recognize me. When he looked down, his eyes were cold and detached, as if he were staring at a piece of trash.

“You've got some nerve, trying to bully my wife.”

“As a matter of fact, the corporation has a project in the middle of nowhere that's always looking for grunts. I say we just ship you off.”

I looked up at them, all wrapped up in each other, and my blood ran cold.

When Noah had proposed, he'd gotten down on one knee in front of me.

Back then, he had kissed my hand, his eyes full of tenderness.

“Harper, I promise I'll spend the rest of my life being good to you. I will never, ever betray you in any way!”

A delayed tremor ran through me. The situation was so absurd that I almost wanted to laugh, but my voice came out raw and hoarse.

The man who once knelt to beg for my hand in marriage was now sentencing me to hard labor while I knelt at his feet.

So this was what he meant by never betraying me.

As I stared at him in a daze, Noah seemed to find something familiar in my expression for a split second.

But the moment passed, and without a second thought, he kicked me hard in the side.

“Bitch! What the hell are you looking at? You made my wife this upset—breaking your leg would be getting off easy!”

“Noah… take a good look! Look at who I am!”

I choked out the words, overwhelmed by a wave of pure agony.

But Noah didn't care. He just grabbed a fistful of my hair and slapped me several more times.

“Who are you? You're just another gold-digging bitch trying to claw your way into the Diaz family. Who else could you be?!”

“I've never seen anyone so shamelessly try to come between me and my wife. You got a death wish or something?!”

Tears streamed down my face, but my heart went numb. I just let them do whatever they wanted.

The onlookers couldn't help but start whispering among themselves.

“Jeez, wasn't she claiming to be the other woman before? Looks like she wasn't even that, just a straight-up liar.”

“She brought this on herself. Why should anyone feel sorry for her?”

“Exactly. If you ask me, there are so many people like her these days because the consequences aren't harsh enough!”

Everyone said I deserved it.

I looked at their monstrous faces and slowly closed my eyes.

Forget it. Let it be. I'm so tired of having to defend myself every single time.

Seeing my state, Noah shoved me back to the ground with a look of utter disgust and wiped his hands.

“Even touching scum like you for a second makes me sick!”

Seeing her chance, Paisley eagerly stepped forward.

“Noah, are you tired? Let me and Hailey take over.”

“Sending a bitch like this, who's trying to ruin what we have, to some work camp is too good for her.”

“If you ask me, we should just send her down to Tijuana. I hear they're always looking for girls like her over there.”

My eyes flew open in terror. Watching the two of them crack their knuckles as they advanced on me, I roared.

“What do you think you're doing?!”

Just as I shouted, another voice boomed from nearby.

“Stop! I'd like to see who dares lay a hand on my daughter-in-law!”

1pcy6kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pcy6kr/what_do_we_say/,What do we say?,"Helen cursed as the Coriolis storm took her small ship and threw it to starboard. Her craft, a ""Sparrow"" class scout, had been tasked with an environmental survey of the Geran system. Three of the worlds were uninhabitable, with her scanners reporting no real resources to harvest. Ammonia atmosphere? Common as dirt. Iron deposits? Please. Platinum? Useless. The only worthwhile body in this junkheap was a class 9 planetoid circling a gas giant.

Atmosphere within limits, medium gravity, sensors detected some forests and about a dozen disparate ground lifeforms. The big surprise had been a reading on the northern continent, large veins of tri titanium ore, traces of solenium and hmmm...zhara crystals? Here? She'd have to land and check it out. Fleet Engineering would be very very happy.

Her systems had not noticed or detected the upper layers instability. Violent turbulence and static discharges. Hopefully theyd bottom out at maybe 15000 feet. Ugh. As she dropped further into the troposphere, static lightning slashed at her cockpit. Her displays flickered, resumed. Using language her mother would have slapped her for, she angled down, hoping to punch through this dense cloud layer. Then a savage tailwind shover her sideways, sending her into a flat spin.

Swearing, sweating and furious, she recovered. Using obscenities that her mother, her father, her grandfather AND her grandmother would have slapped her for, she forced nose level, finally emerging at low altitude.

""Join the Scout Service, they said"". An alarm beeped. ""See the stars in all their glory, they said."" The alarm cut off. ""*They aint paying me enough for this shiiiiiiit....""*

A low rattling sound alerted her to the stabilators, one of which was now loose. Where to land? Ahh perfect. Right hand side. Forest clearing with room to spare. Now to land this thing..IF the belly jets haven't been ripped off.

Putting the craft into a steep turn, she extended the aerofoils. Manual landing. Not trusting the auto systems after that approach. A sigh of relief escaped her as she landed with ease.

""Computer, open rear hatch and launch survey probe. Set for full scan, mineral and botanical both. Scan lifeforms, compile biosphere ecology. Upon completion, copy data to ship's core on return. Execute.""

***\*\*\*\*\*WORKING.\*\*\*\****

then

***\*\*\*\*LAUNCH COMPLETE\*\*\*\****

Helen watched the tiny device arrow away through the cryoplast canopy then keyed the atmosensors. Oxygen , nitrogen, xenon, traces of argonite gas but well within limits. Environment..occasional rainstorms. It will have to do.

Exiting, she scrambled to the rear carrier pod. A small blockshaped bot rested inside, didn't look damaged. She hoped. The bot lit up at a voice command. "" Scan ship"" she snapped. The bot hovered out of its nest, lifted on tiny microgravs , then ran a beam from stem to stern.

***\*\*DAMAGE MINIMAL. STABILATOR, REAR THRUSTERS, MINOR HULL BREACHES. ESTIMATE FOUR HOURS TO SYNTHESISE PARTS AND COMPLETE REPAIR\*\****

""Acknowledged. Proceed.""

***\*\*COMPLIANCE\*\****

The following hour was taken up with basic routine. Set up hab tent. Release two stealthed scuttlebugs, one for soil samples, one for water and possible sea lifeforms. Set up weather scanners and a mapping theodolite.

And finally..lunch. Coffee had never tasted so good.

Out of the corner of her eye...movement. Must have come out of the treeline. Standing slowly, Helen shifted, watching whatever this was carefully.

Almost two metres long, six legs. Purple, almost shiny pelt. It took a step towards her, claws extended. A voice inside her head whispered ""predator"". The head was a nightmare, looking like the petals of a flower with waving tendrils and two mobile eyestalks, the mouth a cruel , fanged beak. As she watched, some kind of tiny lifeform scurried past, the beast instantly snatching it and devouring at almost snakelike speed.

That was the appetiser. She was the main course. Her mind racing, Helen assessed her options.

Stunrifle? In the cockpit.

Climb in and seal the canopy? No, it would attack the bot.

Never taking her eyes off the animal, Helen drew her service knife, moving to the right with the grace of a glassdancer. It followed her unerringly, body low as it stalked its prey. Across maybe ten metres, they studied each other. She lowered her body into combat crouch, the creature hissing softly as it recognised her posture as an invitation to combat.

It lunged forward , claws extended. As it leaped, Helen dropped onto her back, kicked out and felt her boots connect, throwing the animal into the air. Rolling back , she saw it pivot in midair, landing heavily on its feet. They faced each other, the creature wary , taking her measure. Its eyestalks were steady.

Two predators faced each other on an alien world, one the result of centuries of evolution and continuous internecine combat on Earth and amongst the stars, the other a master of its domain, lord of the forests whom all else feared. 

On a primitive level, both knew this could only end one way. One would live, one would die. No mercy. No quarter. No surrender. Two predators bred to survive.

For a few seconds the two formed a frozen, silent tableau. Helen could hear her instructor's voice from her first days in combat training. ""*Stay low, centred, keep balance. If they get inside your guard, its over.*""  Then it moved, this time a low ""pounce"" attack, claws extended. Instantly, Helen spun to her right, unleashing a fast spin kick to its midriff. Her foot connected, her opponent rolled over onto its feet, body low to the ground.

Shifting tactics, it attacked from the side, seeking to get past her guard, it failed but as it changed position its prehensile tail whiplashed sideways. Searing pain exploded at her temples as the attack connected. Blindly, a roaring in her ears, she slashed forward and down, her blade raking the creature's hindquarters. Blood flowed, deep grey and viscous.

In that second,  Helen realised she had made a fatal mistake. A wounded predator was always the deadliest of enemies. It had been just hungry. Now? It was hungry AND pissed.

Berserk with rage, it uttered an earsplitting screech , turned to face her. Rearing on its four back legs, its beak snapped open, tentacles suddenly writhing forward to seize her arms and draw her in for the kill.

Instinctively, eyes blurry , she shifted left, pivoting in a half turn to its rear. Her arm wrapped around its neck in a vise, knife blade flashing as she flipped it over, bringing the pommel down in a crushing blow to its head.

Heart pounding, hands quivering with fear and adrenaline, Helen's breath came in gasps as the animal fell at her feet. Her vision started to clear. One thrust would end it all. Her hand lifted the knife, then slowly returned it to its sheathe.

Something stopped her, a feeling, memories of wars long past, always remembered.

*No. Killing a helpless enemy was the act of a coward.*

Kneeling, Helen laid her palm against the creature's heaving sides, feeling its soft, warm fur in her fingers. ""No. Not today. Not like this "" she spoke softly, one hand caressing its fur gently. ""When death comes for you, my friend, you deserve to meet Him on your feet. Until next time.""

Summoning the bot, Helen wrapped the predators feet in a cari-strap , the two of them dragging the unconscious animal back to the treeline. Repairs complete, she lifted off, issuing remote commands for the survey bugs to remain for later pickup.

As night fell, the predator stirred, painfully staggering to its feet. Padding to the clearing, it saw the prey was gone, leaving only the acrid smell of burned soil .

Staring into the darkened skies, its mouth opened in a defiant screech, then turned and vanished into the forest.",5,1764747956.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1pcy649,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pcy649/where_the_trees_turn_red/,Where The Trees Turn Red,"Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

""Inside Autumn. Light's getting low."" Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

""Think they'll hit the street early again?"" He asked her.

""Not likely.""

Confused, I asked them both, ""What're you talking about?""

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

""Come here, kiddo,"" he said, ushering me to join him by a window. ""I'll show you.""

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

""See that car? The lights?"" Dad asked.

I nodded.

""A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him.""

""Did he find them?"" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. ""He did, but-"" He tossed the words around in his head. ""They'd uh... gone to Heaven.""

""Like Aunty?""

""Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did.""

""Keep us safe?""

""Exactly. They keep us all safe.""

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

""But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?""

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

""Do you see her?!"" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

""*Sean*."" Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

""See who?"" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, ""You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn.""

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. ""Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?"" He whispered. ""Who'd you think she annoyed?""

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. ""Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though,"" she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. ""Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch.""

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. ""Everyone has a bad day,"" I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. ""Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her.""

Kate then nudged my arm. ""She's looking at you, by the way.""

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. ""Hello? You still with us?""

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. ""Don't! Let her sit by herself.""

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, ""Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother,"" all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. ""Dude, are you good?""

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

""Autumn, right?"" She beamed as I took a seat. ""Sean's sister?""

""Who did that to you?""

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

""Was it your dad?"" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. ""Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell.""

""Was it Ben? You overstepped?""

She paused and then nodded slowly.

""You've been seeing him without me?"" Sean asked.

""You haven’t?""

""Who's Ben?"" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

""Local press,"" Sean said. ""Red hair, built like a stick-"" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, ""-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition.""

My stomach churned. ""You've been out there?! What, at night?!"" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. ""I told you she'd be keen."" She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. ""You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-""

""I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise.""

""Is that right?"" Willow teased.

""*Yes*."" He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. ""And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind."" He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. ""Or yours, I hope.""

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. ""Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-""

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. ""Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure.""

""Oh, come on."" She pouted. ""I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!"" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. ""When?""

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

""Back to your friends, kiddo. Now.""

""I don't... why'd I-""

""*Autumn. Now.""*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

""Why don't we pay him a visit?"" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

""Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?"" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. ""What could go wrong?""

""Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one,"" Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, ""scratch her itch.""

""It's not an... 'itch', Kate.""

""Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?""

""Hey, back off."" Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. ""It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch.""

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. ""Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-""

""Or get laid.""

""Or write music!"" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. ""I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'.""

""You guys suck.""

""No we don't.""

Arthur clasped his hands together. ""Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy.""

Barney groaned, ""I don't know, man... Mom would always say-""

""Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?""

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

""Yeah, no thanks."" Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. ""Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?""

""Nope.""

""Marvellous.""

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

""Hello?!"" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. ""Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here.""

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. ""Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?""

""You're more likely to see rats, Arthur."" She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. ""Guys,"" he cried, peering down at the floor, ""come take a look at this.""

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

""Oh, God no,"" Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

""You fucking found it, dork,"" Kate said. ""What're you complaining about?""

""And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?"" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. ""Ladies first."" He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. ""Autumn!"" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. ""What do we do?"" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. ""We could go to the woods.""

""Not a chance!"" Barney whined. ""I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-""

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. ""Bears?"" She gestured to the room we stood in. ""That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*""*

""Guys!"" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. ""Can we... not argue, please?"" I then looked at Arthur. ""Get a picture of that map.""

Barney shrivelled up into himself. ""No, we can't-""

Kate punched him in the shoulder. ""We can, and we are.""

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. ""Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads.""

""Not a chance."" Arthur pressed quietly.

""Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise."" I lied.

""Are you sure?"" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. ""See you tomorrow."" He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. ""Do you want to go home?""

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

""No.""

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. ""Last chance.""

""I'm sure.""

He managed a comforting smile. ""Okay.""

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

""Who's this?"" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. ""His sister.""

""Huh. Impeccable timing, kid.""

An anxious energy came over Sean. ""Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-"" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. ""Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along.""

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. ""We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?""

""Heads up!"" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. ""Listen.""

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

""What is that?"" I asked.

""No idea."" Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. ""Hope you messaged Arthur.""

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. ""We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not.""

Willow let out a tiny laugh. ""You want what I want, right?"" Then she looked at me. ""Having fun yet?"" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

""I'm not scared."" I blurted out.

""I know, but-""

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

""We should... probably leave,"" Sean said, dreary and sheepish. ""Tell someone.""

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

However, the inside bags have 0 identification information. I ended up opening both back to back and almost forgot which was which. Which is bad user experience imo? 

I think the inside bags should always have some identifying information for the bag, and ideally the roast date. Since the outer packaging becomes useless the moment it’s opened from the bottom. I had to write the roast date on the bag myself :/

And the card, while useful, needs to be taken out from the top. IMHO, that card could just be printed and slapped on the bags, with the roast date written w a marker directly on it. I love nice packaging, but what I love more is well thought out nice packaging. 
The coffee beans look promising, will let them rest! 
Sorry for the rant, but incase you end up ordering multiple bags, please write on the package before you mix them up. 

Love what they’ve done with the brand, but this could def improve experience.

She definitely thought of sewing it for him and got mad at herself

No wolves? That's concerning

Ohh, the snakes and the foxes!

Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Like elves. 

Also, who is this lady? She's awfully helpful for a random stranger, but she isn't radiating sketchiness like every other untrustworthy character. And why is she calling him archer?

How long has it been since they left?

Poor Perrin :( at least he and Faile aren't beefing anymore
I bet Tam suspects something. Probably not that his (adopted) son is the Dragon Reborn, but something

Wtf. Who is Fain. A *Myrddraal* as a prisoner. Madman

I love the contrast between who Perrin has become and the Emond Fielders' old image of him 

And like clockwork, whenever I become invested in what's happening in one place, the scene changes

Rand bio parents backstory!!! Finally!!!!

Gitara means ""guitar"" in my language. Just. Putting it out there

Platonic devotion <333

Breaking the rules in a way no one expects... I'm intrigued

Uh oh, I think one of the letters was a bit angry... I don't think saying Elayne meant them would cheer Rand up

What's the purpose of them being naked in a sauna tent?

A hat! Mat was wearing a straw hat in Egwene's (was it Egwene?) dream

Moooom Rand is being cryptic again

Something happened to everyone. Dead, fled, something 

Yep.

Ooh, Mat is going to make for a good strategist in any upcoming grand battle

I'm assuming this chapter is setting things up for the future, but I'd be lying if I said I care about any of these characters

How selfish could you be to offer up even more of your family to be killed just to delay your own death sentence

Wait, the Court of the Nine Moons! Mat is meant to marry a princess from there or something!

This conversation is complete gibberish to me. They're from Seanchan, I think? I still don't fully understand the locations and governmental structure over there

Ohhh right kaf in a drink. Coffee, I'm guessing 

Is Nynaeve's solution to drunkenness straight up waterboarding?

Goldeneyes! Neat

I doubt Faile is actually dead

Oh, is Faile's father a general?

Ah. We find out who he is literally a page later

They communicated! That's somewhat new

Women, amiright? Making sure you take your medicine and rest after you've been injured. Smh

Ohh. The man who looked like Lan but attacked Nynaeve was Slayer

I just remembered an argument I had in my head about the Way of the Leaf back when I was reading the first book. How do they feed the dogs without meat? There's no way they're able to balance their diet properly with only fruits and vegetables. Also, where do they draw the line? Plants are also alive. Some plants can even feel pain. And what about self defense? Is it right to let many die just to hold up tradition? I have a lot of thoughts about the tinkers and they're all jumbled

Okay so I know the guy is injured, but let him have *some* dignity!

Honestly, as much as they argue, Perrin and Faile are currently the healthiest relationship, I think

There was very little buildup to their relationship, but they're cute together

They did a cheeky bit of deforestation

Oh my god? Was that a real name? Jon? Real person name in hit fantasy book series The Wheel of Time???

Perrin, you're the leader here whether you like it or not. Of course they waited for you to give the orders

I like watching blumineck - he's a guy on youtube who makes videos about archery - and seeing a bunch of little details I remember being talked about as often being portrayed inaccurately makes me a bit giddy. Taking care of the bow's string! Keeping it unstrung sometimes! Perrin bending and stringing a longbow easily as a way of showing how strong he is! People sticking their arrows in the ground instead of using a quiver! (<- people had many different ways of holding their arrows throughout history, but back quivers are heavily overrepresented in media because it makes archer characters more easily recognisable)

Does the red wolf on the banner have yellow eyes? Because if it doesn't they got their branding all wrong

Omg they actually did it!

Oh. It was a test attack. Of course it wouldn't be so easy.

Perrin, will you get it through your thick head already that the people here see you as an authority?

You're a leader now, Perrin. Can't just go sneaking off to do something dangerous. You're not some lone wolf (pun was unintended when thought first popped up, but pun absolutely intended now)

Is this one of the forsaken? She's not one of the black ajah they're looking for, but she can channel, and she has a similar effect to the one Lanfear had on Rand. I'd think this was Lanfear, but she was described as handsome rather than beautiful, and this series makes a distinction between the two

Lmaoo even in their altered state they're only answering strictly the questions she's asking. No *Aes Sedai* with them. No ter'angreal *in their rooms*.

Oh, yeah, definitely one of the forsaken.

Finally, we're back at the tower!

Right, Masema. Zealous idiot.

They killed her warder? Monsters!

Wait, Gawyn stopped warders from helping??? What side is he on?

Wow, Aviendha does not understand the concept of different cultures at all

The Aiel Waste is kind of like Australia, when you think about it

I can't tell what the red and shiny ones are, but the yellow ones with broad leaves are definitely bananas
Are the ""gray speckled fowl"" turkeys?

Wait, dragkar are sapient?

Chopsticks! Sorry, *sursa*

How does Nynaeve know how horse meat tastes?

Okay so the woman who compelled them was Moghedien. Was ""the man [she] almost disturbed at Rhuidean"" Slayer? Is Slayer Asmodean? Why would he look like Lan then?

Aww. It feels a bit fast, but people do tend to be quick to marry in times of war

Either 1) the Forsaken aren't that strong, 2) Moghedien is the weakest of them, or 3) Nynaeve is extremely powerful

Wait. Was it a trick?

I'm remembering Aram and Perrin's dynamic in the first book, and compared to now... it's day and night

Wait, so who's who? The weird gleeman, lord Luc, Asmodean and Slayer? Are they all one and the same? How?

Rand is fucking powerful. He barely knows what he's doing and he can already go toe to toe with some of the strongest channellers in existence

Damn.

I could’ve clarified but I truthfully had no reason to believe I was incorrect. I truly thought I was doing what was expected until I am called (as I’m heading out) and asked to clarify where I got my numbers. 

Despite that I immediately offered to go back in and fix it while fighting the urge to cry. This will now be used against me for as long as I’m supporting this other department. I can’t stand the fact that it will be consistently brought up from now on and for any task.

I don’t know whether to bite my tongue when I’m talked down to tomorrow (I’m constantly spoken to like a person with no experience or like a dog.

With this setup, am I basically limited by my skills and bean selection now, or are there any obvious hardware bottlenecks I’m missing?

Gear:

* Machine
   * Breville Bambino (Like New) – $182 after 20% off Amazon Resale promo
      * I decided on the bambino eventually when I saw that promo. But it was going up against Casabrews 4518 Pro ($170), Hibrew H10a or H10b ($199/$135), Gevi EMNC0 ($285). Tough to choose, but went with the best track record. But the feature set of those other ones were very tempting!
* Grinder
   * MOKKOM Professional 64mm flat burr grinder – $166
      * It was this or the Encore ESP. I liked the look, materials,and upgradability on the Mokkom.
* Espresso and Espresso Accessories
   * KEEPCA 54mm dosing funnel – $8
   * Jbvytre 54mm bottomlessportafilter w/ basket & screen – $15
   * MATOW 53.3mm tamper – $19
   * ElevateTech 54mm unbleached espresso paper filters, 500 pack – $7
   * NMW earthmone knock box – $12
   * KitchenTour CaféMetric espresso scale with timer – $14
   * Lavazza Super Crema, 22 oz – $11
   * Lavazza Espresso Barista Gran Crema, 2.2 lb – $15

Hardware all-in: about $420

Goal: Tastier espresso (mostly americanos for me and milk coffee drinks for wife) without falling into a $$$ rabbit/black hole.

Others argue you’re fluent only if you can actually *make friends* in the language. Talk about daily life, hobbies, humor, inside jokes, and basically any informal social interaction.

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially tarts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

“Hi,” I said, because my mouth was a traitor. “Creative housing?”

# Chapter 2

Maya

An overpriced hotel was really looking good right now.

“I come in peace,” I called, because I wanted to live, “and also with paperwork.”

The first to move was the one who looked like he’d been carved out of shadow and expectations. He was tall, had broad shoulders and dark hair, pushed back with ruthless efficiency.

His gray eyes watched me like they’d already assessed all my flaws and filed them alphabetically. The scar through his eyebrow should’ve made him prettier; it made him colder. And he was shirtless… Very, very shirtless.

My eyes did a terrified hop from abs to ceiling, then to the floor like I’d stared straight at the sun. I could feel the heat crawling up my ears and cheek. I shifted from my right leg to the left, hoping with everything in me that he didn’t just see that.

“Lost?” he said.

“Placed,” I said, holding up the keycard. “By Housing.”

His gaze flicked to the card, then to me, to the duffle bag on my shoulder, then to my face again. He didn’t smile.

The way he looked at me was cruel and clinical… like he was cutting me raw with teh sharpness of his gaze. Something in my shoulders pulled tight like I’d been called to stand still while someone measured me.

I watched the calculations happening in his head—subtle shifts in his jaw as if he were sorting me into a criterion.

“We’re not a dorm,” he said flatly.

“So I hear.” I gulped, shifting the weight of the bag to my next thigh. “And apparently also not a sorority.” That part wasn’t supposed to be heard, but they all seemed to hear it just the same, all three rewarding me with different looks, ranging from disapproval to downright humor. I didn’t even know I said that so loud.

The joke caught on a dry throat, and I cleared it once before my mouth remembered how to behave.

The other man who just ditched his apron, leaned on the doorway, dark curls messy and blue eyes bright with the sort of trouble that didn’t apologize afterward. He grinned when I looked up, and it lit the room.

“Welcome to the fortress, sweetheart,” he said. “I’m Caden. He’s Ty,” he said, motioning to the shirtless super model still glaring at me. “Don’t mind the glower,” he added softer, but evidently wanted him to hear. “It’s chronic.”

Ty didn’t look away from me. “Tylon,” he corrected mildly. “And no.”

His words came out clipped and controlled, like he was barely restraining himself from growling or something. A small tick in his jaw said the correction wasn’t negotiable.

“No… what?” I asked.

“No, you can’t stay.”

“Fun story,” I said, smile bright and completely fake. “I actually don’t want to stay here. But if I don’t, I stay nowhere. And I have to be at the Comms & Policy internship building at eight a.m. bright-eyed and not smelling like a bus station tomorrow morning. So unless Housing intends to bunk me in a filing cabinet—”

“Let me see the authorization,” Ty said, cutting me off with his palm out.

I handed it over. He read the memo about temporary placement, capacity issues, and needing their compliance.

He went very still with the paper steady in one hand, his shoulders squared, and his eyes tracking down the text like he was checking for a loophole. Whatever it said, his jaw ticked once, and he passed the card back.

“Temporary,” he said.

“Thrilling,” I replied.

Caden moved towards me and took my duffel bag, and the relief was instant.

“I’ve got it,” he murmured as the strap slid off my shoulder under his hand, and his fingers brushed mine in a quick, reassuring caress.

He wore an easy grin, easy posture, and even gave me a little shoulder bump that said it would be fine even if nothing else seemed so. For a reckless second, I almost believed it. He had that type of effect, it seemed.

“We can put her in the sunroom,” he said as he tossed it over his shoulder.

“We are not putting a stranger in the sunroom,” Tylon said.

“Guest suite, then,” Caden said, without turning.

“Not the guest suite.”

There was a light chuckle, and it was then that I remembered the third man who was still kneeling in front of the broken vacuum. He brushed off his jeans as he stood, and I realized right there and then that i was placed in a house with three Greek god-looking men to live with for a whole semester, or more.

God, help me.

He looked younger than Caden and Tylon, but he wasn’t any less magnificent. They were all handsome in their own way, and I had no idea if there were anymore.

His hazel eyes glittered with a mixture of indifference, but feeding into Caden’s humor.

“Library couch?” he offered.

“Stop helping,” Tylon growled.

“Hi,” I said to the third one, seizing the gap. “I’m Maya, by the way. I’m very organized, I clean up after myself, I label things in a way that is helpful and not creepy, and I make coffee that will make up for the awful one they make here, apparently.”

Something like humor touched his eyes. “Leonardo. Leo for short,” he said. “Coffee is a strong argument.”

Ty’s gaze cut to me, then to the ceiling, then back like he was considering letting me stay and throwing me out.

“I will take this up with the heads, but for now, house rules,” he said finally. “No parties without agreement. No guests without notice. No entering rooms that aren’t yours. No going downstairs after midnight.”

Caden glanced back. “That last one isn’t real.”

“It is now.”

Leo leaned against the doorframe where Caden previously was, with his hands in his pocket. “She’s clearly capable of handling herself. No one’s scared of your scowl, Ty.”

“She should be. She’s human,” Ty said.

“‘She’ is standing right here!” I huffed, hating that the conversation seemed to be flying over me. “And are you insinuating that you’re not? What are you? Some super-human just because you seem to wear a permanent scowl and bossy pants?”

I heard Caden draw a sharp breath, and Leo’s eyes widened. And suddenly, I felt like I just crossed a line.

But I wasn’t about to let him treat me like some incompetent child, just because we were forced into something that none of us were ready for or wanted. But what the hell can I do about it?

Absolutely nothing. So we just had to live with it.

Silence reigned for a few seconds, and I didn’t miss the way Caden edged towards me, as if he was preparing to jump in front of me should Tylon leap.

He didn’t crowd me… just angled himself a breath closer, like a steady heat at my side and a buffer if I needed it. Weirdly, that tiny, ordinary detail calmed me more than anything.

But instead, Tylon simply mumbled, “Just remember the rules,” and left.

“Right,” Caden said after a beat. “That settles it. Sunroom it is.”

Rule number one: Don’t die.

Got it.

# Chapter 3

Maya

“This is you,” Caden said, showing me into the sunroom.

There was glass on three sides of the room, a low bed, and yellow curtains that made the room even brighter.

“It’s… a greenhouse with delusions of a bedroom,” I said before I could stop myself.

But he laughed, the kind of laugh was warm and makes a place feel less like a stranger.

“Technically it’s a room,” he said, dropping my bag at the foot of the bed. “But your description has better PR.”

He didn’t leave. Of course he didn’t. He leaned a palm on the doorframe and looked around like he was measuring whether the light would bother me at dawn, whether the latch would stick, whether I cared. That last one, I wasn’t sure about.

“You keep a planner,” he said, tipping his chin at the one tucked under my arm. “Color-coded.”

“It’s how I know what to panic about,” I half-joked. “Red is due now, orange is due an hour ago, yellow is me pretending it can wait.”

“And blue?”

“Blue is coffee.”

“Then we’ll get along,” he mused, evoking another real laugh from me.

I had a feeling coffee wasn’t the thing that would make us get along.

He stepped in, close enough that I caught the clean, warm smell of his soap and something sharper that wasn’t cologne.

He reached for the curtain chord just as I did, and his hand grazed mine. He didn’t move away quickly, but he didn’t make it a moment either, and both choices said he knew exactly what he was doing.

“We’ll get you a blackout shade if the sunrise is too much,” he said in a cool, chill voice that made me see another part of him. “Or you can juts come to my room.”

I snorted and gave him a pointed look. “How many girls have you given that speech to?”

“Two,” he said lightly, then held my gaze. “Counting you.”

I shouldn’t have smiled. But I absolutely did.

A soft knock hit the doorframe behind him.

Leo entered with towels, some sheets and blankets and one of my two suitcases.

“These just arrived,” he said, rolling in the second behind the first. “And I got you these just in case none was in here.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking them. His fingers brushed mine, brief and warm, much like when it happened with Caden. But with Leo, I couldn’t quite tell where he stood.

He hadn’t been downright cold like Tylon, nor openly welcoming like Caden. He just seemed… polite. Like he was doing the bare minimum because he was stuck in this situation too, and not because he actually wanted me here.

Still, I appreciated the gesture, and I smiled just the same as I pulled away my hand.

Caden’s gaze cut to the motion.

“That a tattoo?” he asked, eyeing my wrist.

“It was a drunk mistake on my sixteenth birthday,” I said, just as lightly, because that was the story, I’d told myself for four years. “My best friend and I got matching ones, except hers didn’t… stick. Long story.”

“Short version?” Caden asked.

“I woke up with it. She didn’t.”

They shared a look I couldn’t translate. It wasn’t mocking, but it wasn’t nothing.

“It’s a wolf,” Caden said, the playfulness thinning but not gone. “That’s an interesting choice.”

I shrugged. “I guess it’s because I’ve always liked dogs.”

Leo’s mouth did a small twitch. Caden looked amused. “But I really am a cat person, so I don’t completely understand.”

Caden looked actually wounded for one second, throwing his hand to his chest with a dramatic gasp, then he grinned.

“Blasphemy.”

“Tragic,” Leo said in a deadpan tone, and it made me laugh because maybe he did have a sense of humor too.

Ty’s appeared in the doorway, his attention fixed on his phone, and, thankfully, fully clothed now.

“Training is at dawn,” he said. “And we tighten rotations this week.”

“Because of the Council?” Leo asked, almost conversational, which told me it wasn’t.

Ty’s thumb paused over his screen. “Because of the Council.”

Caden’s eyebrows flicked up. “We’re not supposed to say the quiet parts out loud in front of the new civilian.”

“I’m not fragile,” I said, even though the word Council slid under my skin like ice. Blackridge’s glossy brochures didn’t mention councils, plural or singular. Orientation had whispered about an old advisory body that “oversaw” and “guided” and probably hosted charity galas with bad appetizers.

But it more sounded like a club with dues and a dress code, not a reason to tighten rotations like we were on a ship heading into a storm.

Ty didn’t correct me. He didn’t confirm me either. He just lifted his gaze to mine long enough to check something I couldn’t name, then walked on.

Caden shifted like he was about to follow, then noticed something on my clothes. I followed where his eyes landed, seeing a loose thread where the hem of my shirt had snagged on the bed frame.

He crouched, met my eyes, and kept a respectful half-step of space.

“May I?” he asked with his palm up, as if waiting for my permission.

I was taken aback by the sudden gentleness, but soon realized he was trying to help.

“Tell me if this is too close,” he added, voice lower at the edges. The ridiculous part was my pulse answering before I did. I nodded.

He angled sideways so I wasn’t boxed in. Hie eyes stayed on the fabric as he freed the snag with careful fingers. Even so, with him that near I could count his breaths. The space between us felt warm and very specific.

From somewhere I didn’t see, he produced a safety pin and tucked the loose stitch inside the seam.

“You carry those around?” I asked.

“I have a complicated relationship with buttons,” he said, hands steady while he pinned the split. “Better?”

“Better,” I said, and it mattered more than it should have.

He looked up and held my gaze a minute longer than necessary, then was the one to look away first. Air I didn’t realize I’d been holding actually moved.

Leo had been quiet in the doorway. His gaze tracked the whole exchange. It looked like a warning. Caden’s answer was a microscopic shrug that said ‘relax, it’s nothing.’

He rocked back on his heels and gave me space again.

Leo’s eyes was still tracking the movements, but he said nothing before leaving.

Odd. He was an odd one.

“Thanks again for everything. You’ve been kind and welcoming,” I said as I plopped in the surprisingly comfy couch across from the bed.

Caden smiled as he leaned against the doorframe again.

“Anytime,” he grinned. “And my bedroom door is open if you want to take me up on the offer of—” He didn’t get a chance to finish, as I hurled a cushion at him, sending him scurrying away.

I chuckled.

Idiot.

# Chapter 4

Maya

I woke in the middle of the night with an urgent need to pee.

I padded to my bathroom door, twisted the handle, and felt the lock catch.

How I managed to lock myself out of my own bathroom? I had no idea.

I tried again because hope is stubborn at one a.m., then tried the classic shoulder nudge that only worked in movies.

The door held.

Of course it did.

Huffing, I decided that I’d just have to find another bathroom somewhere in this humongous house.

I’d learn in the few hours I was here, that my room was on the third story of the house, along with the men’s offices. They all had an office for themselves, which was weird but oddly convenient, and another sunroom. No bathrooms.

So, I ventured onto the second floor.

The second floor was quiet, so I tried to be too. I tried one door and found a linen closet that smelled like lemon; another door that was locked, and a third that seemed like an empty bedroom.

I huffed, losing patience and my ability to hold the pee, and then I pushed a door that wasn’t latched and stepped into a room that was not a bathroom.

It was Tylon’s room.

How I knew? Because he was there, but not asleep.

A woman was braced on the edge of a neatly tided desk like the rest of the room, and she was butt naked.

So was Tylon.

It didn’t take me long to register what was happening, because it was happening right in front of me. I retreated a step and hid myself behind the cracked door, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t tear my eyes away.

Her palms were flat against the desk, and Tylon had her ponytail wrapped around his knuckle, which caused her head to tilt and her back to arch.

Her moans filled the room as Tylon gripped her hips, driving himself inside of her with a force and precision that made me gasp and wince at the same time.

His body was a work of art, as I would have noticed today when I arrived. But seeming him like this was… different. His muscles were tight, his back was straight and sight of him this way made me almost quiver. His face was drawn taught, eyes squeezed shut with his bottom lip between his teeth.

It made something in my stomach twist hard enough to make me mad at myself. My brain tried to file the scene under ‘privacy violation and leave,’ while some treacherous corner of me recognized the way skill looks when it doesn’t apologize. I was not jealous of her, I told myself. I didn’t even like him. I was a student who needed a restroom and a normal life. It didn’t matter that my mouth went dry. It didn’t matter that I was a virgin who never knew what that felt like. But seeing the skilled way he moved, and judging by the sounds she made made me want to feel it too. And gosh, I hated myself for it.

I actually wished that the sudden warmth pooling at my thighs was pee, but I knew better. I wanted it. Or him. Or whatever the hell this was, but maybe it was the pee and fatigue talking. So I finally had the decency to do what i should have done from the beginning—leave.

I began to back out, careful and quiet.

But then he made a low, unguarded, sound, and my name fell out of it like a match.

“Maya.”

The woman’s head snapped up. And I stopped dead in my tracks as my entire stomach plummeted, and I think I actually peed a little bit. Yet, hearing him call my name in such a way—hearing him call my name at all, made something else inside of me melt.

“What did you just call me?” The woman demanded, her voice was sharp enough to cut glass.

He stopped as his eyes widened and his spine rigid. He pinched the bridge of his nose like pain and annoyance had just invaded his life.

“It’s not—” He exhaled. “There’s a new tenant. She a human. Housing shoved her into the house today. It’s been… a distraction. I’ve been thinking of her, but not like that. Goddess, never like that.” I pretended it didn’t hurt. “But I’ve been thinking about how I fast we can get rid of her.”

The word landed like a slap, and my lungs forgot their job. I was a distraction. An administrative error with a pulse.

I stood there half in shadow, a stupid thief caught with nothing but my own embarrassment.

The woman pulled herself upright with a practiced sort of grace, hair falling over one shoulder as she twisted to look at him. “I heard about that arrangement,” she said, cool again. “If she bothers you, I can deal with her.”

Something changed in him so fast I felt it in the doorway. “You will not touch her.” The words were quiet, as if he’d swallowed the shout. But it was deadly.

She blinked, taken aback, then lifted her chin and started dressing, each movement efficient, and irritated.

Tylon turned away and reached for his trousers with the same grace he uses on everything.

She fastened a button, and turned to him again. “Fine. Same time tomorrow?”

“No.” He didn’t even look at her. “We’re done.”

“That’s what you always say, Ty, but then you come calling again. It’s been three weeks and you called me tonight, didn’t you?”

“It was a lapse in judgment. I needed a distraction from the distraction.”

She was evidently pissed, but smirked anyway. “The human has really gotten under your skin, hasn’t she?”

I didn’t mean to make a sound. But It slipped out anyway. It was a soft, shocked breath that gave me away.

Two heads turned in the same instant.

Tylon’s eyes found mine through the thin strip of open door, and the flash of fury there sent me stumbling backward into the hall.

He shouted my name again, but this time, it was different from what I heard moments ago.

“Maya!” 

# Chapter 5

Maya

I made it two steps before he was there, fast and unrelenting as his fingers closed around my wrist and yanked me back so hard, I thought my shoulder popped.

I screamed, but he didn’t let go as he swerved me around to face him.

His grip was strong and hard, speaking a message of his anger for itself. I felt the blood flow slowing, not quite pain yet, except it was already more than I could bear on a night like this.

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” He growled, and his voice was low but not quiet, the kind of control that vibrates.

“I… bathroom.” I couldn’t seem to form a full sentence as my brain went blank. “I locked myself out. I wasn’t spying, I swear.”

Down the hall, the woman had paused at Tylon’s door with one brow lifted, and her mouth tilted in a way that seemed amused. Like she had just won something I didn’t know about.

Embarrassment was eating me whole, but fear and guilt was at number one.

The point and truth of it all was, I really had no idea who these men were, and I had no idea what they were capable of. And the way he was looking at me right now brought back way too many childhood memories that I tried to bury.

My breathing grew ragged and hard, and I knew what was happening.

“You were told not to wander after midnight,” he growled. It wasn’t a question, and it landed like an accusation anyway.

“I wasn’t,” I pleaded, and I heard the tremor in my voice as my heartbeat grew. “Please… let go.” My voice broke on the last word without my permission, small and ugly.

Something changed in his face as if a wire inside had just come loose. His hand didn’t soften. But his is eyes did… just a little.

“Tylon!”

A new voice joined us in the hallway, and I glanced passed him to see Leo charging towards us. Sleep was still in his eyes, but also anger.

“Let her go, Tylon!” he shouted. “Don’t you see you’re hurting her.?

Tylon released me so fast I stumbled.

But Leo reached me before the wall did and steadied me with arms. I leaned into that steadiness for a second because my body wanted to, whether from fear or warmth or plain relief… I couldn’t tell.

The woman now wore a scowl as she glowered at me, specifically about Leo’s arms around me.

“What the hell, man?” Leo didn’t raise his voice. He looked at my hand, and I looked too. A bruise would bloom there by morning in the shape of Tylon’s hand, no doubt. “Look at her wrist.”

Tylon’s eyes flickered to my wrist, and I saw the guilt for barely a second before he masked it with indifference and annoyance. His throat worked before he answered Leo.

“She was in my doorway,” Tylon said, and the anger was back. “She saw… Heard… I don’t even know how much she saw or heard.”

Leo’s eyes trailed toward Tylon’s doorway, as if he was just seeing the woman. He didn’t even spare her that much of a glance as she smiled and wiggled her fingers at him in a suggestive wave.

“How much does that matter?” Leo asked. “We live in a house with doors and locks. Close it.”

“She shouldn’t have been wandering around in the first place. This is my house. If i want to keep my door open, I have all fucking right to do so.”

I wiped my cheeks because crying on my first night here was humiliating enough.

“I came down to find a bathroom,” I repeated. “I locked myself out of mine, so I tried a few doors. I didn’t mean to…”

I hung my head because I was, indeed, wrong for staying and I was embarrassed.

“The bathrooms connect to the bedrooms,” Leo said to me in a gentle tone. “Except the powder room on the ground floor.” He tipped his head toward the end of the hall. “Use mine. It’s closer.”

Tylon’s throat worked. He didn’t apologize. He didn’t explain. He looked at me like he was checking for injuries he couldn’t see and then looked away as if the act of looking had cost him too much.

The woman, now fully composed, watched all three of us with that small, confident smile.

“So,” she said to Tylon, “call me if you change your mind.”

“I won’t,” he said, and it was final in a way that made her blink once. She slid past us with a rustle of fabric and the silent certainty of someone who knows she’ll get what she wants.

Tylon didn’t look back as he went into his room and slammed the door. I flinched, but Leo was still holding me. I allowed it, and he guided me two doors down.

It was tidy without being obsessive, unlike Tylon’s, but gave nothing away that hinted at his personality. No pictures, no posters. You would have thought he just moved in today too.

He flipped on the light in the bathroom and stepped back so I could pass. “There.”

“Thank you,” I managed, voice low and raw at the edges. I hesitated in the doorway because it felt wrong not to say something. “I didn’t mean to cause trouble.”

I felt like I was five again, apologizing to those people… after already enduring their ‘punishment’.

“You didn’t,” he said, and I almost believed him. “Don’t let him intimidate you. Ty is… Ty. He thinks protecting people and controlling them are the same thing. It’s his way, or no way. The situation isn’t ideal, but we all just have to work with it.”

I nodded because anything more would have made me cry again. I closed the door with a ragged breath, and realized I didn’t even want to pee anymore.

Maya

The sunroom was prettier at six a.m and tempting to stay and watch. But I needed my morning fuel, especially since I barely slept last night and today was my first day at my internship.

However, Caden was already at the espresso machine when I went down for coffee. His hoodie sleeves were rolled to his elbows, and his hair was damp from what seemed like an early-morning shower.

He glanced back like I was right on time, but I didn’t miss how fast his hand went to the purple bruise forming on my hand.

“Good morning stranger,” he said. “Coffee?”

“Sure,” I said, as I approached him with a yawn and a stretch.

His eyes trailed down my body, and I felt the heat rising in my cheeks as he did. I completely forgot that I only packed shorts and tank tops as my night clothes. They were the only things I had. Last night I’d been so wrapped up in everything that I hadn’t even realized how minimally clothed I was.

I shifted slightly behind the counter to hide the shadow of skin that was being revealed under the tiny blouse. I needed to get dressed soon, before the next two men came.

He bumped my shoulder with his. I could feel his heat and humor, the exact dose I needed to feel like I could breathe again.

“Sorry,” I mumbled, leaning over the counter as I sipped my coffee. “I don’t have anything better. Unless I’ll start wearing my work clothes to bed,” I joked.

“You should.” That voice came from behind me, causing me to jump as I swerved around. Of course, Tylon stood in the doorway, eyes hooded and jaw tight as usual.

He wore a black T-shirt, clean jeans and eyes that seemed like they were evidently awake longer than mine.

It was then that I realised that Caden saw only a glimpse, but Tylon saw everything behind when I was leaning over the counter.

His jaw ticked once, and his fists were clenched as if he was holding himself back from doing something. His eyes were anywhere but on me, and I knew that he saw everything. I mean, I wasn’t butt naked, but the shorts were very very… small.

I burnt red.

Looks like I need to put that $42 to good use and buy myself some pyjamas.

He didn’t so much as glance back my way, his attention went straight to Caden.

By the look on his face, I thouhBy the look on his face, I thought he was about to dish out some deathly threat at Caden.

“You haven’t bought the groceries yet,” he said, taking me by surprise. “It your turn.”

Caden’s mouth tipped but not into a smile. He had already seen the mark on my wrist, and he seemed to have known it was by Tylon’s hand.

I could tell by the way his eyes had gone flat and careful and the muscle in his cheek had started doing its own thing.

“Fine,” he said, voice even. “But I’m buying strawberry milk.”

“I drink regular,” Tylon replied.

“Exactly.”

A pause stretched. Ty’s jaw ticked once. “I’ll do the shopping,” he said at last. “Pay the bills on time.”

He left without another word, the air organizing itself in his wake.

“You totally did that on purpose,” I said, half a laugh, half a question.

Caden didn’t shrug it off this time. He looked at my wrist again, then at the doorway Ty had walked through.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t there last night,” he said quietly. “Leo told me what happened. And I’m not surprised. Over the years I’ve known Ty, he’s…“ He sighed and shook his head, as if deeming it useless. “I’m a heavy sleeper. But if you ever need anything, knock. Don’t worry about the hour.”

The apology surprised me more than it should have. “Thank you,” I said, soft because it mattered. I scuffed my thumb over the edge of the mug and tried to make my voice normal. “So… you’ve known him forever?”

“We’ve known each other since we were kids. This is his house, and the school is located in his pa—” His eyes widened as if he saw something scary, then he coughed on the words. It was one of those fake coughs that suggested he was trying to hide something.

“His what?” I pressed.

He shifted uncomfortably, and his eyes were evidently trying to find a way to tell me. “His… Parents house,” he said as if he had a lightbulb moment. “Well, basically, the entire area is kind of owned by his parents. And the neighbouring… land is mine.” I didn’t understand the pause in his sentence, but I let it slide.

“So you guys are basically some rich aristocratic families?”

He had that thoughtful look again. “Yes, I guess you can say that. Why do you think it’s called the Blackridge house? It’s not names after the university, you know. More like the university is named after his family, centuries old.”

“His name is Blackridge?” I asked as my eyes widened, and Caden nodded. “Oh damn. So, he can throw me out.”

Caden threw back his head with a laugh. “No, princess. No, he can’t. It’s basically his house, but the directive came directly from the… heads.”

“Like the council?”

Yet again, I managed to put that shocked look on his face. I really should start making notes. But then he collected himself, as if remembering that they mentioned it yesterday.

“Yes. Exactly like that.”

“So, you do guys work for your families? Or do you just get everything handed to you?”

His face went unnaturally still, and I seemed to have struck a nerve. I felt awful. Maybe I said it too harsh? Maybe I misjudged them? Maybe they don’t get handouts—

“Yeah,” he said, breaking me from my thoughts. He looked down, evidently troubled by something. “Yeah, I work for my father.”

Oh. So, he wasn’t offended about the handouts comment. Yet, it seemed he had a complicated relationship with his father.

“I work for him alright,” he added with a humourless laugh. “Though I wished I didn’t.”

I wanted to ask what kind of work he did, but I didn’t want to pry or push him farther into a hole he was evidently uncomfortable with.

“So, what’s Blackridge like? Not the family. The university,” I asked, and I could see that he was grateful for the topic change.”

“Oh, you’ll love it. You’re transferred, right? So you’re going into third year?”

“Yeah,” I said, heaving out a breath. “But I’m not so much worried about school as I am about the internship. I need this to work out. My future and education depend on me being able to stay in this internship.”

Caden drained his mug and threw it in the dishwasher before turning to face me again.

“Well, from what I know, that program is full of preppy, geeky students. So, you should fit right—” I sailed a kitchen towel at him before he could finish, but I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.

“You are of no help!” I managed through my laugh.

He shrugged innocently as he backed out of the kitchen with his hands up. “It got you smiling though, didn’t it?”

I opened my mouth to throw another rebut at him,but he was gone before I could.

I rolled my eyes and finished my own coffee.

We had coffee and then went shopping for a bit.

It made me realize though, again, how masked I am all the time, how careful I am about my reactions and what I say. Because she was so much less masked than me, which I admire, but also feel uncomfortable with.

At the same time, it felt like reckless driving without a seatbelt. She talked so much, and was very intense, and disclosed some very personal things. Then I ended up disclosing some things that I usually would never say to a new person, which made me feel very vulnerable.

And I thought about how I am ""too intense,"" and how I have often overshared, and how much work I've put into building my mask so that I don't overwhelm people and scare them off. (Which happens a lot anyway, because I am still terrible at social interactions.)

So then I had a meltdown while I was driving home after. I feel lonely so much, and yet it was really overstimulating to spend a few hours with her. And then I had this gross reaction that I have also had in the past, that if someone likes me and wants to hang out with me there must be something wrong with them and it makes me want to reject them. Which is of course just my own self hatred sabotaging me again. But also I have misread people in the past and not made great judgements in choosing friends.

I am 48f. I have no close woman friends at this point in my life, besides a cousin and my sister. I really miss having women friends. But it turns out I have a shitload of baggage about friendship after a lifetime of social difficulty. (Also my relationship with best friend for decades ended a few years back, which was really hard and devastating.)

I guess I just wanted to see if anyone can relate or has comforting words of wisdom.

But a few weeks back I went on checking updates on instagram and I saw a post done by Infinity Timeless and I suddenly thought that all I had on my wrist was a dressy watch that felt totally wrong for daily wear which awfull to match that watch in every occasion. And that post just clicked something in my head. I realised I’d been forcing my dress watch into situations it had no business, being in  coffee runs, office days, random errands, everything.  
The Ranger, though it feels like the opposite of all that stress. It’s simple, rugged, and actually looks better the more you wear it. No need to baby it, no need to overthink outfits, it just *works*.  
Since then it’s been sitting in the back of my mind like, ‘hey, I’m the watch you actually need.’

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially tarts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

“Hi,” I said, because my mouth was a traitor. “Creative housing?”

# Chapter 2

Maya

An overpriced hotel was really looking good right now.

“I come in peace,” I called, because I wanted to live, “and also with paperwork.”

The first to move was the one who looked like he’d been carved out of shadow and expectations. He was tall, had broad shoulders and dark hair, pushed back with ruthless efficiency.

His gray eyes watched me like they’d already assessed all my flaws and filed them alphabetically. The scar through his eyebrow should’ve made him prettier; it made him colder. And he was shirtless… Very, very shirtless.

My eyes did a terrified hop from abs to ceiling, then to the floor like I’d stared straight at the sun. I could feel the heat crawling up my ears and cheek. I shifted from my right leg to the left, hoping with everything in me that he didn’t just see that.

“Lost?” he said.

“Placed,” I said, holding up the keycard. “By Housing.”

His gaze flicked to the card, then to me, to the duffle bag on my shoulder, then to my face again. He didn’t smile.

The way he looked at me was cruel and clinical… like he was cutting me raw with teh sharpness of his gaze. Something in my shoulders pulled tight like I’d been called to stand still while someone measured me.

I watched the calculations happening in his head—subtle shifts in his jaw as if he were sorting me into a criterion.

“We’re not a dorm,” he said flatly.

“So I hear.” I gulped, shifting the weight of the bag to my next thigh. “And apparently also not a sorority.” That part wasn’t supposed to be heard, but they all seemed to hear it just the same, all three rewarding me with different looks, ranging from disapproval to downright humor. I didn’t even know I said that so loud.

The joke caught on a dry throat, and I cleared it once before my mouth remembered how to behave.

The other man who just ditched his apron, leaned on the doorway, dark curls messy and blue eyes bright with the sort of trouble that didn’t apologize afterward. He grinned when I looked up, and it lit the room.

“Welcome to the fortress, sweetheart,” he said. “I’m Caden. He’s Ty,” he said, motioning to the shirtless super model still glaring at me. “Don’t mind the glower,” he added softer, but evidently wanted him to hear. “It’s chronic.”

Ty didn’t look away from me. “Tylon,” he corrected mildly. “And no.”

His words came out clipped and controlled, like he was barely restraining himself from growling or something. A small tick in his jaw said the correction wasn’t negotiable.

“No… what?” I asked.

“No, you can’t stay.”

“Fun story,” I said, smile bright and completely fake. “I actually don’t want to stay here. But if I don’t, I stay nowhere. And I have to be at the Comms & Policy internship building at eight a.m. bright-eyed and not smelling like a bus station tomorrow morning. So unless Housing intends to bunk me in a filing cabinet—”

“Let me see the authorization,” Ty said, cutting me off with his palm out.

I handed it over. He read the memo about temporary placement, capacity issues, and needing their compliance.

He went very still with the paper steady in one hand, his shoulders squared, and his eyes tracking down the text like he was checking for a loophole. Whatever it said, his jaw ticked once, and he passed the card back.

“Temporary,” he said.

“Thrilling,” I replied.

Caden moved towards me and took my duffel bag, and the relief was instant.

“I’ve got it,” he murmured as the strap slid off my shoulder under his hand, and his fingers brushed mine in a quick, reassuring caress.

He wore an easy grin, easy posture, and even gave me a little shoulder bump that said it would be fine even if nothing else seemed so. For a reckless second, I almost believed it. He had that type of effect, it seemed.

“We can put her in the sunroom,” he said as he tossed it over his shoulder.

“We are not putting a stranger in the sunroom,” Tylon said.

“Guest suite, then,” Caden said, without turning.

“Not the guest suite.”

There was a light chuckle, and it was then that I remembered the third man who was still kneeling in front of the broken vacuum. He brushed off his jeans as he stood, and I realized right there and then that i was placed in a house with three Greek god-looking men to live with for a whole semester, or more.

God, help me.

He looked younger than Caden and Tylon, but he wasn’t any less magnificent. They were all handsome in their own way, and I had no idea if there were anymore.

His hazel eyes glittered with a mixture of indifference, but feeding into Caden’s humor.

“Library couch?” he offered.

“Stop helping,” Tylon growled.

“Hi,” I said to the third one, seizing the gap. “I’m Maya, by the way. I’m very organized, I clean up after myself, I label things in a way that is helpful and not creepy, and I make coffee that will make up for the awful one they make here, apparently.”

Something like humor touched his eyes. “Leonardo. Leo for short,” he said. “Coffee is a strong argument.”

Ty’s gaze cut to me, then to the ceiling, then back like he was considering letting me stay and throwing me out.

“I will take this up with the heads, but for now, house rules,” he said finally. “No parties without agreement. No guests without notice. No entering rooms that aren’t yours. No going downstairs after midnight.”

Caden glanced back. “That last one isn’t real.”

“It is now.”

Leo leaned against the doorframe where Caden previously was, with his hands in his pocket. “She’s clearly capable of handling herself. No one’s scared of your scowl, Ty.”

“She should be. She’s human,” Ty said.

“‘She’ is standing right here!” I huffed, hating that the conversation seemed to be flying over me. “And are you insinuating that you’re not? What are you? Some super-human just because you seem to wear a permanent scowl and bossy pants?”

I heard Caden draw a sharp breath, and Leo’s eyes widened. And suddenly, I felt like I just crossed a line.

But I wasn’t about to let him treat me like some incompetent child, just because we were forced into something that none of us were ready for or wanted. But what the hell can I do about it?

Absolutely nothing. So we just had to live with it.

Silence reigned for a few seconds, and I didn’t miss the way Caden edged towards me, as if he was preparing to jump in front of me should Tylon leap.

He didn’t crowd me… just angled himself a breath closer, like a steady heat at my side and a buffer if I needed it. Weirdly, that tiny, ordinary detail calmed me more than anything.

But instead, Tylon simply mumbled, “Just remember the rules,” and left.

“Right,” Caden said after a beat. “That settles it. Sunroom it is.”

Rule number one: Don’t die.

Got it.

# Chapter 3

Maya

“This is you,” Caden said, showing me into the sunroom.

There was glass on three sides of the room, a low bed, and yellow curtains that made the room even brighter.

“It’s… a greenhouse with delusions of a bedroom,” I said before I could stop myself.

But he laughed, the kind of laugh was warm and makes a place feel less like a stranger.

“Technically it’s a room,” he said, dropping my bag at the foot of the bed. “But your description has better PR.”

He didn’t leave. Of course he didn’t. He leaned a palm on the doorframe and looked around like he was measuring whether the light would bother me at dawn, whether the latch would stick, whether I cared. That last one, I wasn’t sure about.

“You keep a planner,” he said, tipping his chin at the one tucked under my arm. “Color-coded.”

“It’s how I know what to panic about,” I half-joked. “Red is due now, orange is due an hour ago, yellow is me pretending it can wait.”

“And blue?”

“Blue is coffee.”

“Then we’ll get along,” he mused, evoking another real laugh from me.

I had a feeling coffee wasn’t the thing that would make us get along.

He stepped in, close enough that I caught the clean, warm smell of his soap and something sharper that wasn’t cologne.

He reached for the curtain chord just as I did, and his hand grazed mine. He didn’t move away quickly, but he didn’t make it a moment either, and both choices said he knew exactly what he was doing.

“We’ll get you a blackout shade if the sunrise is too much,” he said in a cool, chill voice that made me see another part of him. “Or you can juts come to my room.”

I snorted and gave him a pointed look. “How many girls have you given that speech to?”

“Two,” he said lightly, then held my gaze. “Counting you.”

I shouldn’t have smiled. But I absolutely did.

A soft knock hit the doorframe behind him.

Leo entered with towels, some sheets and blankets and one of my two suitcases.

“These just arrived,” he said, rolling in the second behind the first. “And I got you these just in case none was in here.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking them. His fingers brushed mine, brief and warm, much like when it happened with Caden. But with Leo, I couldn’t quite tell where he stood.

He hadn’t been downright cold like Tylon, nor openly welcoming like Caden. He just seemed… polite. Like he was doing the bare minimum because he was stuck in this situation too, and not because he actually wanted me here.

Still, I appreciated the gesture, and I smiled just the same as I pulled away my hand.

Caden’s gaze cut to the motion.

“That a tattoo?” he asked, eyeing my wrist.

“It was a drunk mistake on my sixteenth birthday,” I said, just as lightly, because that was the story, I’d told myself for four years. “My best friend and I got matching ones, except hers didn’t… stick. Long story.”

“Short version?” Caden asked.

“I woke up with it. She didn’t.”

They shared a look I couldn’t translate. It wasn’t mocking, but it wasn’t nothing.

“It’s a wolf,” Caden said, the playfulness thinning but not gone. “That’s an interesting choice.”

I shrugged. “I guess it’s because I’ve always liked dogs.”

Leo’s mouth did a small twitch. Caden looked amused. “But I really am a cat person, so I don’t completely understand.”

Caden looked actually wounded for one second, throwing his hand to his chest with a dramatic gasp, then he grinned.

“Blasphemy.”

“Tragic,” Leo said in a deadpan tone, and it made me laugh because maybe he did have a sense of humor too.

Ty’s appeared in the doorway, his attention fixed on his phone, and, thankfully, fully clothed now.

“Training is at dawn,” he said. “And we tighten rotations this week.”

“Because of the Council?” Leo asked, almost conversational, which told me it wasn’t.

Ty’s thumb paused over his screen. “Because of the Council.”

Caden’s eyebrows flicked up. “We’re not supposed to say the quiet parts out loud in front of the new civilian.”

“I’m not fragile,” I said, even though the word Council slid under my skin like ice. Blackridge’s glossy brochures didn’t mention councils, plural or singular. Orientation had whispered about an old advisory body that “oversaw” and “guided” and probably hosted charity galas with bad appetizers.

But it more sounded like a club with dues and a dress code, not a reason to tighten rotations like we were on a ship heading into a storm.

Ty didn’t correct me. He didn’t confirm me either. He just lifted his gaze to mine long enough to check something I couldn’t name, then walked on.

Caden shifted like he was about to follow, then noticed something on my clothes. I followed where his eyes landed, seeing a loose thread where the hem of my shirt had snagged on the bed frame.

He crouched, met my eyes, and kept a respectful half-step of space.

“May I?” he asked with his palm up, as if waiting for my permission.

I was taken aback by the sudden gentleness, but soon realized he was trying to help.

“Tell me if this is too close,” he added, voice lower at the edges. The ridiculous part was my pulse answering before I did. I nodded.

He angled sideways so I wasn’t boxed in. Hie eyes stayed on the fabric as he freed the snag with careful fingers. Even so, with him that near I could count his breaths. The space between us felt warm and very specific.

From somewhere I didn’t see, he produced a safety pin and tucked the loose stitch inside the seam.

“You carry those around?” I asked.

“I have a complicated relationship with buttons,” he said, hands steady while he pinned the split. “Better?”

“Better,” I said, and it mattered more than it should have.

He looked up and held my gaze a minute longer than necessary, then was the one to look away first. Air I didn’t realize I’d been holding actually moved.

Leo had been quiet in the doorway. His gaze tracked the whole exchange. It looked like a warning. Caden’s answer was a microscopic shrug that said ‘relax, it’s nothing.’

He rocked back on his heels and gave me space again.

Leo’s eyes was still tracking the movements, but he said nothing before leaving.

Odd. He was an odd one.

“Thanks again for everything. You’ve been kind and welcoming,” I said as I plopped in the surprisingly comfy couch across from the bed.

Caden smiled as he leaned against the doorframe again.

“Anytime,” he grinned. “And my bedroom door is open if you want to take me up on the offer of—” He didn’t get a chance to finish, as I hurled a cushion at him, sending him scurrying away.

I chuckled.

Idiot.

# Chapter 4

Maya

I woke in the middle of the night with an urgent need to pee.

I padded to my bathroom door, twisted the handle, and felt the lock catch.

How I managed to lock myself out of my own bathroom? I had no idea.

I tried again because hope is stubborn at one a.m., then tried the classic shoulder nudge that only worked in movies.

The door held.

Of course it did.

Huffing, I decided that I’d just have to find another bathroom somewhere in this humongous house.

I’d learn in the few hours I was here, that my room was on the third story of the house, along with the men’s offices. They all had an office for themselves, which was weird but oddly convenient, and another sunroom. No bathrooms.

So, I ventured onto the second floor.

The second floor was quiet, so I tried to be too. I tried one door and found a linen closet that smelled like lemon; another door that was locked, and a third that seemed like an empty bedroom.

I huffed, losing patience and my ability to hold the pee, and then I pushed a door that wasn’t latched and stepped into a room that was not a bathroom.

It was Tylon’s room.

How I knew? Because he was there, but not asleep.

A woman was braced on the edge of a neatly tided desk like the rest of the room, and she was butt naked.

So was Tylon.

It didn’t take me long to register what was happening, because it was happening right in front of me. I retreated a step and hid myself behind the cracked door, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t tear my eyes away.

Her palms were flat against the desk, and Tylon had her ponytail wrapped around his knuckle, which caused her head to tilt and her back to arch.

Her moans filled the room as Tylon gripped her hips, driving himself inside of her with a force and precision that made me gasp and wince at the same time.

His body was a work of art, as I would have noticed today when I arrived. But seeming him like this was… different. His muscles were tight, his back was straight and sight of him this way made me almost quiver. His face was drawn taught, eyes squeezed shut with his bottom lip between his teeth.

It made something in my stomach twist hard enough to make me mad at myself. My brain tried to file the scene under ‘privacy violation and leave,’ while some treacherous corner of me recognized the way skill looks when it doesn’t apologize. I was not jealous of her, I told myself. I didn’t even like him. I was a student who needed a restroom and a normal life. It didn’t matter that my mouth went dry. It didn’t matter that I was a virgin who never knew what that felt like. But seeing the skilled way he moved, and judging by the sounds she made made me want to feel it too. And gosh, I hated myself for it.

I actually wished that the sudden warmth pooling at my thighs was pee, but I knew better. I wanted it. Or him. Or whatever the hell this was, but maybe it was the pee and fatigue talking. So I finally had the decency to do what i should have done from the beginning—leave.

I began to back out, careful and quiet.

But then he made a low, unguarded, sound, and my name fell out of it like a match.

“Maya.”

The woman’s head snapped up. And I stopped dead in my tracks as my entire stomach plummeted, and I think I actually peed a little bit. Yet, hearing him call my name in such a way—hearing him call my name at all, made something else inside of me melt.

“What did you just call me?” The woman demanded, her voice was sharp enough to cut glass.

He stopped as his eyes widened and his spine rigid. He pinched the bridge of his nose like pain and annoyance had just invaded his life.

“It’s not—” He exhaled. “There’s a new tenant. She a human. Housing shoved her into the house today. It’s been… a distraction. I’ve been thinking of her, but not like that. Goddess, never like that.” I pretended it didn’t hurt. “But I’ve been thinking about how I fast we can get rid of her.”

The word landed like a slap, and my lungs forgot their job. I was a distraction. An administrative error with a pulse.

I stood there half in shadow, a stupid thief caught with nothing but my own embarrassment.

The woman pulled herself upright with a practiced sort of grace, hair falling over one shoulder as she twisted to look at him. “I heard about that arrangement,” she said, cool again. “If she bothers you, I can deal with her.”

Something changed in him so fast I felt it in the doorway. “You will not touch her.” The words were quiet, as if he’d swallowed the shout. But it was deadly.

She blinked, taken aback, then lifted her chin and started dressing, each movement efficient, and irritated.

Tylon turned away and reached for his trousers with the same grace he uses on everything.

She fastened a button, and turned to him again. “Fine. Same time tomorrow?”

“No.” He didn’t even look at her. “We’re done.”

“That’s what you always say, Ty, but then you come calling again. It’s been three weeks and you called me tonight, didn’t you?”

“It was a lapse in judgment. I needed a distraction from the distraction.”

She was evidently pissed, but smirked anyway. “The human has really gotten under your skin, hasn’t she?”

I didn’t mean to make a sound. But It slipped out anyway. It was a soft, shocked breath that gave me away.

Two heads turned in the same instant.

Tylon’s eyes found mine through the thin strip of open door, and the flash of fury there sent me stumbling backward into the hall.

He shouted my name again, but this time, it was different from what I heard moments ago.

“Maya!” 

# Chapter 5

Maya

I made it two steps before he was there, fast and unrelenting as his fingers closed around my wrist and yanked me back so hard, I thought my shoulder popped.

I screamed, but he didn’t let go as he swerved me around to face him.

His grip was strong and hard, speaking a message of his anger for itself. I felt the blood flow slowing, not quite pain yet, except it was already more than I could bear on a night like this.

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” He growled, and his voice was low but not quiet, the kind of control that vibrates.

“I… bathroom.” I couldn’t seem to form a full sentence as my brain went blank. “I locked myself out. I wasn’t spying, I swear.”

Down the hall, the woman had paused at Tylon’s door with one brow lifted, and her mouth tilted in a way that seemed amused. Like she had just won something I didn’t know about.

Embarrassment was eating me whole, but fear and guilt was at number one.

The point and truth of it all was, I really had no idea who these men were, and I had no idea what they were capable of. And the way he was looking at me right now brought back way too many childhood memories that I tried to bury.

My breathing grew ragged and hard, and I knew what was happening.

“You were told not to wander after midnight,” he growled. It wasn’t a question, and it landed like an accusation anyway.

“I wasn’t,” I pleaded, and I heard the tremor in my voice as my heartbeat grew. “Please… let go.” My voice broke on the last word without my permission, small and ugly.

Something changed in his face as if a wire inside had just come loose. His hand didn’t soften. But his is eyes did… just a little.

“Tylon!”

A new voice joined us in the hallway, and I glanced passed him to see Leo charging towards us. Sleep was still in his eyes, but also anger.

“Let her go, Tylon!” he shouted. “Don’t you see you’re hurting her.?

Tylon released me so fast I stumbled.

But Leo reached me before the wall did and steadied me with arms. I leaned into that steadiness for a second because my body wanted to, whether from fear or warmth or plain relief… I couldn’t tell.

The woman now wore a scowl as she glowered at me, specifically about Leo’s arms around me.

“What the hell, man?” Leo didn’t raise his voice. He looked at my hand, and I looked too. A bruise would bloom there by morning in the shape of Tylon’s hand, no doubt. “Look at her wrist.”

Tylon’s eyes flickered to my wrist, and I saw the guilt for barely a second before he masked it with indifference and annoyance. His throat worked before he answered Leo.

“She was in my doorway,” Tylon said, and the anger was back. “She saw… Heard… I don’t even know how much she saw or heard.”

Leo’s eyes trailed toward Tylon’s doorway, as if he was just seeing the woman. He didn’t even spare her that much of a glance as she smiled and wiggled her fingers at him in a suggestive wave.

“How much does that matter?” Leo asked. “We live in a house with doors and locks. Close it.”

“She shouldn’t have been wandering around in the first place. This is my house. If i want to keep my door open, I have all fucking right to do so.”

I wiped my cheeks because crying on my first night here was humiliating enough.

“I came down to find a bathroom,” I repeated. “I locked myself out of mine, so I tried a few doors. I didn’t mean to…”

I hung my head because I was, indeed, wrong for staying and I was embarrassed.

“The bathrooms connect to the bedrooms,” Leo said to me in a gentle tone. “Except the powder room on the ground floor.” He tipped his head toward the end of the hall. “Use mine. It’s closer.”

Tylon’s throat worked. He didn’t apologize. He didn’t explain. He looked at me like he was checking for injuries he couldn’t see and then looked away as if the act of looking had cost him too much.

The woman, now fully composed, watched all three of us with that small, confident smile.

“So,” she said to Tylon, “call me if you change your mind.”

“I won’t,” he said, and it was final in a way that made her blink once. She slid past us with a rustle of fabric and the silent certainty of someone who knows she’ll get what she wants.

Tylon didn’t look back as he went into his room and slammed the door. I flinched, but Leo was still holding me. I allowed it, and he guided me two doors down.

It was tidy without being obsessive, unlike Tylon’s, but gave nothing away that hinted at his personality. No pictures, no posters. You would have thought he just moved in today too.

He flipped on the light in the bathroom and stepped back so I could pass. “There.”

“Thank you,” I managed, voice low and raw at the edges. I hesitated in the doorway because it felt wrong not to say something. “I didn’t mean to cause trouble.”

I felt like I was five again, apologizing to those people… after already enduring their ‘punishment’.

“You didn’t,” he said, and I almost believed him. “Don’t let him intimidate you. Ty is… Ty. He thinks protecting people and controlling them are the same thing. It’s his way, or no way. The situation isn’t ideal, but we all just have to work with it.”

I nodded because anything more would have made me cry again. I closed the door with a ragged breath, and realized I didn’t even want to pee anymore.

# Chapter 6

Maya

The sunroom was prettier at six a.m and tempting to stay and watch. But I needed my morning fuel, especially since I barely slept last night and today was my first day at my internship.

However, Caden was already at the espresso machine when I went down for coffee. His hoodie sleeves were rolled to his elbows, and his hair was damp from what seemed like an early-morning shower.

He glanced back like I was right on time, but I didn’t miss how fast his hand went to the purple bruise forming on my hand.

“Good morning stranger,” he said. “Coffee?”

“Sure,” I said, as I approached him with a yawn and a stretch.

His eyes trailed down my body, and I felt the heat rising in my cheeks as he did. I completely forgot that I only packed shorts and tank tops as my night clothes. They were the only things I had. Last night I’d been so wrapped up in everything that I hadn’t even realized how minimally clothed I was.

I shifted slightly behind the counter to hide the shadow of skin that was being revealed under the tiny blouse. I needed to get dressed soon, before the next two men came.

He bumped my shoulder with his. I could feel his heat and humor, the exact dose I needed to feel like I could breathe again.

“Sorry,” I mumbled, leaning over the counter as I sipped my coffee. “I don’t have anything better. Unless I’ll start wearing my work clothes to bed,” I joked.

“You should.” That voice came from behind me, causing me to jump as I swerved around. Of course, Tylon stood in the doorway, eyes hooded and jaw tight as usual.

He wore a black T-shirt, clean jeans and eyes that seemed like they were evidently awake longer than mine.

It was then that I realised that Caden saw only a glimpse, but Tylon saw everything behind when I was leaning over the counter.

His jaw ticked once, and his fists were clenched as if he was holding himself back from doing something. His eyes were anywhere but on me, and I knew that he saw everything. I mean, I wasn’t butt naked, but the shorts were very very… small.

I burnt red.

Looks like I need to put that $42 to good use and buy myself some pyjamas.

He didn’t so much as glance back my way, his attention went straight to Caden.

By the look on his face, I thouhBy the look on his face, I thought he was about to dish out some deathly threat at Caden.

“You haven’t bought the groceries yet,” he said, taking me by surprise. “It your turn.”

Caden’s mouth tipped but not into a smile. He had already seen the mark on my wrist, and he seemed to have known it was by Tylon’s hand.

I could tell by the way his eyes had gone flat and careful and the muscle in his cheek had started doing its own thing.

“Fine,” he said, voice even. “But I’m buying strawberry milk.”

“I drink regular,” Tylon replied.

“Exactly.”

A pause stretched. Ty’s jaw ticked once. “I’ll do the shopping,” he said at last. “Pay the bills on time.”

He left without another word, the air organizing itself in his wake.

“You totally did that on purpose,” I said, half a laugh, half a question.

Caden didn’t shrug it off this time. He looked at my wrist again, then at the doorway Ty had walked through.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t there last night,” he said quietly. “Leo told me what happened. And I’m not surprised. Over the years I’ve known Ty, he’s…“ He sighed and shook his head, as if deeming it useless. “I’m a heavy sleeper. But if you ever need anything, knock. Don’t worry about the hour.”

The apology surprised me more than it should have. “Thank you,” I said, soft because it mattered. I scuffed my thumb over the edge of the mug and tried to make my voice normal. “So… you’ve known him forever?”

“We’ve known each other since we were kids. This is his house, and the school is located in his pa—” His eyes widened as if he saw something scary, then he coughed on the words. It was one of those fake coughs that suggested he was trying to hide something.

“His what?” I pressed.

He shifted uncomfortably, and his eyes were evidently trying to find a way to tell me. “His… Parents house,” he said as if he had a lightbulb moment. “Well, basically, the entire area is kind of owned by his parents. And the neighbouring… land is mine.” I didn’t understand the pause in his sentence, but I let it slide.

“So you guys are basically some rich aristocratic families?”

He had that thoughtful look again. “Yes, I guess you can say that. Why do you think it’s called the Blackridge house? It’s not names after the university, you know. More like the university is named after his family, centuries old.”

“His name is Blackridge?” I asked as my eyes widened, and Caden nodded. “Oh damn. So, he can throw me out.”

Caden threw back his head with a laugh. “No, princess. No, he can’t. It’s basically his house, but the directive came directly from the… heads.”

“Like the council?”

Yet again, I managed to put that shocked look on his face. I really should start making notes. But then he collected himself, as if remembering that they mentioned it yesterday.

“Yes. Exactly like that.”

“So, you do guys work for your families? Or do you just get everything handed to you?”

His face went unnaturally still, and I seemed to have struck a nerve. I felt awful. Maybe I said it too harsh? Maybe I misjudged them? Maybe they don’t get handouts—

“Yeah,” he said, breaking me from my thoughts. He looked down, evidently troubled by something. “Yeah, I work for my father.”

Oh. So, he wasn’t offended about the handouts comment. Yet, it seemed he had a complicated relationship with his father.

“I work for him alright,” he added with a humourless laugh. “Though I wished I didn’t.”

I wanted to ask what kind of work he did, but I didn’t want to pry or push him farther into a hole he was evidently uncomfortable with.

“So, what’s Blackridge like? Not the family. The university,” I asked, and I could see that he was grateful for the topic change.”

“Oh, you’ll love it. You’re transferred, right? So you’re going into third year?”

“Yeah,” I said, heaving out a breath. “But I’m not so much worried about school as I am about the internship. I need this to work out. My future and education depend on me being able to stay in this internship.”

Caden drained his mug and threw it in the dishwasher before turning to face me again.

“Well, from what I know, that program is full of preppy, geeky students. So, you should fit right—” I sailed a kitchen towel at him before he could finish, but I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.

“You are of no help!” I managed through my laugh.

He shrugged innocently as he backed out of the kitchen with his hands up. “It got you smiling though, didn’t it?”

I opened my mouth to throw another rebut at him,but he was gone before I could.

I rolled my eyes and finished my own coffee.

1pcxp0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmAmazon/comments/1pcxp0s/which_adult_coloring_books_suit_busy_professionals/,Which adult coloring books suit busy professionals?,"Hey everyone,

Finding time to unwind after a packed workday can be tough. You're probably looking for something that helps you relax without requiring hours of commitment. Adult coloring books have become a go-to stress relief tool for busy professionals, but not all of them work well when you only have 20-30 minutes to spare.

**What Makes a Good Coloring Book for Busy People?**

When you're short on time, you need coloring books with designs that you can finish quickly or work on in sections. Complex mandalas with thousands of tiny spaces might look beautiful, but they're not ideal when you need something you can actually complete. Look for books with varied design complexity – some simpler pages for weeknights and more detailed ones for weekends.

Geometric patterns work great because you can color one section at a time and still feel accomplished. Abstract designs and simple nature scenes also give you that satisfaction without demanding hours of focus.

**Size and Portability Matter**

Standard 8.5 x 11 inch books fit nicely in a work bag. Smaller pocket-sized options are perfect for lunch breaks or travel. Perforated pages are a bonus – you can tear them out and frame your favorites or just avoid the awkward binding getting in your way.

**Themes That Actually Appeal to Adults**

Skip the overly whimsical stuff unless that's your thing. Architecture, botanical illustrations, zen patterns, and modern art designs tend to appeal more to professionals. Some books focus on motivational quotes combined with designs, which adds an extra layer of positivity to your coloring time.

**Paper Quality Can't Be Ignored**

Thin paper means marker bleed-through, which ruins the next page. Thicker paper (at least 90 GSM) handles colored pencils, gel pens, and even light marker work. One-sided printing is another feature worth looking for.

If you're ready to explore options that fit your schedule, you can check out a solid selection here: https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books

**Quick Recommendations by Style**

- **Geometric patterns**: Perfect for analytical minds who enjoy structure
- **Botanical and floral**: Calming without being too simple
- **Abstract and modern art**: Great for creative types
- **Mindfulness and meditation designs**: Focus on repetitive, soothing patterns

**Making It Part of Your Routine**

Keep your coloring book and supplies visible. When they're tucked away in a drawer, you'll forget about them. A basket on your coffee table or desk works perfectly. Even 10 minutes before bed can help you disconnect from screens and work stress.

You don't need to finish a whole page in one sitting. Half-completed designs are totally fine. The goal is stress relief, not perfection.

**Where to Start**

Amazon has tons of options with honest reviews that help you see what you're actually getting. You can find books suited for every style preference and time constraint. Browse through different categories and read what other busy people are saying about them: https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books

The right adult coloring book fits into your life rather than adding another task to your list. Something portable, with designs you can tackle in short bursts, makes all the difference. Your downtime deserves something simple that actually helps you relax.

 Ethiopia offers bright and floral notes with a hint of fruit  
 Colombia provides smooth and balanced flavors with nutty undertones

Flavored whole beans often taste more natural because the added flavor bonds directly to the bean surface. This enhances the brewing process and improves the final cup.

# 3. Full Brewing Flexibility

You can enjoy flavored beans through drip brewing, espresso, French press, pour over or cold brew. They fit every brewing style and preference.

If you enjoy experimenting with new taste combinations, **Flavored Coffee Beans** give you the most customizable and flavorful experience.

Just today, I went to a local fast food to buy 2 Cereal Milk Iced Coffee (y'all probably know what fastfood offers this drink) to go. My order was placed at exactly 1:30pm(also shows at my receipt). My number is 228. This branch is at its peak hour and there's just a torrent of orders coming in (after placing mine) but looks like bottlenecking at the claim area. All things considered, I prepared myself and expected that orders may take some time and that I should extend a little patience.

I was waiting in the claiming area from afar for around 10mins, when I noticed them shouting numbers already past my number. I heard them giving out the order for 229, 230, 233. I thought, ""it's okay, theirs are probably readily available so it's the fastest to complete"" (thinking this is some sort of a Diner Dash game) but then I heard numbers 241 and 242 and it clicked on me.

I have to follow up.

I slowly approached just to check in and followed up on my order. This ""kid"" crew finishing the orders said, ""ay priority po namin yung mga dine in for now eh"". My mind went numb. Seeing all those big orders na for dine in, full of trays all lined up in front of me and behind theirs, she expects me to wait for ALL of those orders to complete before they tend to mine? I stood there unable to speak. Still trying to fight a congress in my head na jinujustify yung situation and baka protocol yun. After a couple more orders, I followed up again. That ""kid"" crew looked at me annoyed and then took their copy of my order number and shoved it somewhere out of their sight.

It has been 20mins, there are five of them dispatching the orders and seeing that they are sending out some orders both FOR TAKE OUT and WITH THE SAME DRINK AS I ORDERED, i now ask myself, ""how difficult is it to prepare mine to take this long?""

That's when I snapped. I angrily followed up my order. ""Excuse me, follow up lang sa order ko, almost 30mins na oh. 2 drinks lang order ko."" All the crews and the manager looked at me in shock except that ""kid"". I can feel the gaze of other customers at me, too (baka masyadong malakas ko nasabi). I heard someone say, ""grabe, bakit umabot ng 30mins?"". I handed my receipt and one scrambled back to the kitchen to prepare it. In less than 2mins I got my order and a sarcastic, ""pasensya na po"" from that ""kid"" of a crew.

Late na sa work, took the joy out of my drink and day, at parang kasalanan ko pa na umorder ng 2 drinks for take out sa isang fastfood na every thing but fast. You were able to dish out 20+ big orders within the span of 30mins pero di nyo maisingit ang 2 drinks ko na kaya nyo iprepare in less than 2 minutes? (Which, in fact, other people's orders nga yung siningit nyo before my order).

Ayun lang yung rant ko. Sorry po in advance if ako man yung mali dito at nakuha ko inis nyo. Sa perspective ko kasi nakakaoffend yung way na parang deliberately tinabi yung order ko para di nila magawa or makita.",1,1764745958.0,RantAndVentPH,1,1.0,False

He was that urban explorer who went viral a few years back for climbing the Dubai antenna. Then he vanished a few weeks ago. The official story is that he died in a climbing accident in the Andes. His Instagram was memorialized, his Patreon shut down, and the news cycle moved on.

That is a lie.

I work in data archival for \[REDACTED\]. My job is usually boring, digitizing old cold war medical records. But last week, a file was incorrectly routed to my queue. It was flagged to be immediately purged from the system after review. I opened it expecting to see boring logistics data. instead, I found a medical file for a patient who didn't technically exist, and a raw audio file recorded three days ago.

They didn't kill him. Well, they did, but not in the way you think. They are trying to bury this. They are trying to erase the location he found. I managed to copy the transcript before the file was wiped from my terminal.

Read this. Save it. And for the love of god, stay away from the Appalachian ""dead zones.""

My hands... god, look at them. They look like dried tobacco leaves left out in the sun for a century. That’s the first thing you need to understand. That is the first thing *I* had to understand when I woke up in this bed, screaming silently because my vocal cords had atrophied into dried, brittle twine.

I am thirty-two years old. I was born in 1993. I grew up playing Pokémon Blue on a translucent purple Gameboy Color. I watched the Twin Towers fall on a rolling cart TV in my fourth-grade classroom. I have a Spotify playlist titled ""Gym Hype"" full of generic indie pop, and I have a lease on a Subaru Outback that I still haven't paid off. I have a girlfriend named Tara who thinks I’m currently hiking the Appalachian Trail to ""find myself."" I haven't called her in three days. Sadly, I never will again.

But if you walked into this sterile, white room right now, past the armed guards in full bio-hazard gear, past the triple-sealed airlock, past the nurses who look at me with a mixture of profound pity and suppressed gag reflexes, you wouldn't see a thirty-two-year-old man. You would see a biological impossibility. You would see a skeleton wrapped in translucent, liver-spotted parchment, wheezing through lungs that have turned to dust and cobwebs. My hair is thin, white wisps clinging to a scalp that feels like paper. My teeth are loose in receding gums, clicking together like dice in a cup every time I try to speak.

The doctors, the military ones, with badges that don't have names, just clearance codes and bar codes, tell me I have maybe fifteen minutes left. My heart is simply too tired to beat. It’s an old heart. A century-old heart trying to power a body that shouldn't exist. It flutters like a dying moth against my ribs. Every beat hurts. It feels like a bruise being pressed, over and over.

I’m dictating this into a recorder held by a trembling intern because my eyes have clouded over with cataracts so thick the world looks like it's made of milk and shadows. I’m dictating this because someone has to know where Blackwood Creek is. And more importantly, why you should never, ever look for it. Why you should let the blank spots on the map stay blank.

You might know me as ""Apex."" If you frequent the subreddits for urban exploration or follow the #AbandonedLore hashtag on Instagram, you’ve seen my work. I’m the guy who found the abandoned Soviet submarine rusting in the sewer system under Vladivostok. I’m the guy who free-climbed the antenna of the incomplete Dubai skyscraper during a sandstorm just to get a selfie. I have two million followers who think I’m invincible. They think I'm a ghost hunter. They think I'm the Indiana Jones of the digital age.

I found the White Whale. The legend of the Pennsylvania backwoods. And it didn't just kill me. It spent me. It reached into my timeline and withdrew everything I was ever going to be, down to the last second.

It started, as all catastrophic ideas seem to, on a dark web forum dedicated to ""Lost Geography"" places that governments actively erased from maps. Not just redacted, but scrubbed. A user named *Chronos\_Zero* posted a scanned document. It was heavily redacted, black bars swallowing entire paragraphs, but the header was legible: **WAR DEPARTMENT - REQUISITION ORDER 119-A - PROJECT AION - OCTOBER 1943**.

The items listed were bizarre. Three tons of tungsten. A particle accelerator component that shouldn't have been theoretically possible until the 1980s. Seven hundred industrial-grade capacitors. And a handwritten letter, clipped to the file, written in German but translated in the margins. It was a refusal letter from Albert Einstein. The letter was the hook. The forger, if it was a forgery, had captured Einstein’s tone of weary brilliance perfectly.

*""To General Groves... You ask me to help you bend the river. You do not understand. Time is not a river. It is a predator. It flows because it is hunting us. Entropy is the digestion of the universe. If you build a dam to stop it, you do not create a lake. You create a cage. And God help whatever is inside when the predator realizes it is trapped.""*

I tracked the coordinates embedded in the file's metadata. They pointed to a valley deep in the Appalachians, a place that, according to Google Earth, was just dense, uninteresting forest. But if you switched to the satellite heat maps, the raw data, not the smoothed-over public version, there was a void. A perfect, circular void, three miles in diameter, where the temperature was always, precisely, 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter, summer, rain, snow, 68 degrees.

I packed my gear. Geiger counter, military-grade respirators, three GoPros, a DSLR with a telephoto lens, and enough climbing rope to scale Everest. I didn't tell Tara. I wanted the scoop. I wanted to be the first to photograph the ""American Chernobyl.""

I didn't know that radiation would have been a mercy. Radiation just kills you. This place did something far worse.

**\[Sound of narrator sipping water, followed by a violent coughing fit.\]**

The military presence wasn't a fence. It was a kill zone. I parked my car ten miles out, hiding it under a camouflage tarp in a ravine. I hiked for three days through dense brush to avoid the old logging roads. The forest there felt... wrong. The deeper I went, the quieter it got. Not the silence of peace, but the silence of anticipation. Like the woods were holding their breath. The birds stopped singing miles ago. Even the wind seemed hesitant to blow through the leaves.

On the second night, I saw the drones. They weren't the quad-copters you buy at Best Buy. These were silent, triangular silhouettes gliding over the treetops, their thermal cameras scanning the ground like the eyes of God. I spent four hours buried under a pile of rotting leaves, breathing through a reed, while they hovered above me. I could feel the hum of their engines in my teeth.

But the drones weren't the strangest thing I saw in the woods. Three miles from the perimeter, I found the campsite. It looked like it was from the 1970s, an orange canvas tent, an old Coleman stove. But it wasn't decayed. It was... flickering. I watched from behind a tree. The tent flap would blow open in a breeze that I couldn't feel, reveal a sleeping bag inside, and then *snap* shut. Open. Snap. Open. Snap. It was moving at a frame rate different from the rest of the world.

I threw a pinecone at it. The pinecone hit the air around the tent and disintegrated into dust. The campsite wasn't just old; it was a temporal blister. A hiccup. I skirted around it, giving it a hundred-yard berth. I realized then that the ""Chronological Hazard"" wasn't just the town. The town was the epicenter, but the shockwaves were cracking the reality of the forest for miles.

About five miles out from the coordinates, I found the first warning sign. It wasn't your standard ""No Trespassing"" or ""Government Property."" It was an old, heavy iron plate bolted to an oak tree, the metal pitted and rusted, almost consumed by the bark growing over it. **DANGER: CLASS-IV CHRONOLOGICAL HAZARD. LETHAL FORCE AUTHORIZED.**

*Chronological Hazard.* I remember laughing at that, my breath misting in the cold morning air. I thought it was code. Maybe ""Chronological"" meant old unexploded ordnance. Landmines from training exercises. I found the remains of a deer a mile later. That was the first sign that I was walking into hell.

The deer was lying across a fallen log. The back half of the animal was a skeleton, bleached white, ribs exposed to the air, covered in dry moss. But the front half... the front half was fresh. The eyes were wet and glassy. The fur was sleek and brown. Blood was still dripping from its nose. It looked like it had been bisected by time itself. It had walked halfway into something, aged fifty years in a second, and died. I touched the skeletal flank. It crumbled to dust. I touched the head. It was warm.

I should have turned back. I looked at that impossible corpse, and every instinct in my primate brain screamed *RUN*. But I adjusted my backpack, checked my camera battery, and kept walking. Because I'm an idiot. Because I wanted the photo.

I bypassed the patrols using a thermal blanket to hide my heat signature and crawling through a drainage ditch filled with icy sludge. I saw the soldiers through the trees. They weren't regular Army. They wore suits that looked like hazmat gear mixed with EOD armor, bulky, lead-lined, faces obscured by gold-tinted visors. They weren't looking for people entering; they were standing with their rifles pointed *inward*. They were terrified of things leaving.

I crossed the threshold at dawn. Or, what I thought was dawn. One moment, I was crawling through mud, the air smelling of wet pine, deer rot, and ozone. The next... the air stopped.

That’s the only way to describe it. The wind died instantly. The damp chill vanished, replaced by a dry, pleasant warmth. The smell of the forest was cut off as if by a knife, replaced by the scent of fresh-cut grass, gasoline, and warm apple pie.

I stood up, brushing the mud off my tactical pants. I checked my Geiger counter. Zero. I checked my watch. The second hand was ticking, but it looked... sluggish. Like it was moving through syrup. I tapped the glass. It ticked once, then hesitated, then ticked again.

I was standing on a paved road. The asphalt was pristine, black and fresh, still smelling of tar. Ahead of me lay a town that looked like a Norman Rockwell painting screaming in silence.

Blackwood Creek.

It was perfect. Terrifyingly perfect. Houses with white picket fences that gleamed in the sun. A main street with a cinema showing *Casablanca*. Cars, beautiful, polished Fords and Chevys from the early 40s, parked diagonally along the street.

But it was the silence. It wasn't quiet. It was *paused*. No birds sang. No insects buzzed. The sun hung in the sky at a perfect 2:00 PM angle, bright and harsh, but it didn't feel warm on my skin. It felt like a stage light. It was static.

I walked down Main Street, my GoPro recording, the only sound the crunch of my boots on the gravel shoulder. I expected it to be a ghost town. A movie set. Then I saw the man watering his lawn.

He was wearing tan slacks and a crisp white button-down shirt. He held a green rubber hose, his thumb over the nozzle, creating a fan of water that arched over a bed of hydrangeas. The water droplets hung in the air, glittering like diamonds, falling with a slowness that made my eyes ache. It was hypnotic.

I approached him, heart hammering against my ribs. ""Excuse me?"" I called out. The man didn't turn. He just kept watering. ""Sir?"" I got closer, stepping onto the pristine grass. ""I'm lost, I...""

The man turned his head. He wasn't frozen. He wasn't a statue. He moved with a fluidity that was terrifyingly normal. But his eyes... Imagine eyes that have seen the same patch of grass, the same spray of water, the same sun at the same angle for eighty-two years. They were bleached of color, the irises a pale, milky gray. The whites were a map of red veins. The skin around them was raw, rubbed countless times.

He looked at me, and deep within those catastrophic eyes, I saw a spark of pure, unadulterated madness. ""You're new,"" he whispered. His voice sounded like grinding stones, unused and dusty. ""You're soft. You're... dying.""

""I'm sorry?"" I stepped back, my hand going to the knife on my belt.

""You're dying,"" he smiled, and his teeth were ground down to nubs from decades of gnashing. ""You're rotting. I can smell the time on you. It stinks. It smells like... exit.""

Before I could reply, the front door of the house swung open. A woman walked out. She was beautiful, in a 1940s way. Victory curls in her hair, a floral dress, holding a tray with a glass pitcher of lemonade. She walked down the porch steps. She smiled at the man. She missed the bottom step.

I flinched, expecting the crash.

The tray hit the concrete path. The glass pitcher shattered. Lemonade exploded outwards in a splash of yellow and ice. And then, the film skipped.

There was a sound, a wet, tearing noise, like a suction cup pulling off wet glass. *SLOOP.*

The shards of glass flew backward, reassembling in mid-air. The lemonade sucked itself out of the grass and into the reforming pitcher. The woman flew backward up the stairs, her feet un-tripping, her body moving in reverse until she stood at the door, the tray whole in her hands. She paused. She looked at me. Then she walked down the steps. She smiled. She missed the bottom step. The glass shattered.

*SLOOP.*

She walked down the steps. She tripped. The glass shattered.

I watched this happen four times. It was a stutter. A glitch. While the man watering the lawn seemed to have free will within the moment, she was trapped in a five-second hell. On the fifth time, I stepped closer. I tried to catch her. I reached out my hand to grab her arm before she fell.

As soon as my skin touched the fabric of her dress, a shockwave hit me. It felt like sticking a fork in a socket. I was thrown backward onto the grass, gasping for air. She fell anyway. She shattered the pitcher anyway. The loop did not care about me. But as she fell, for the thirty-thousandth time, I saw her face. She wasn't screaming in surprise. She wasn't gasping. She was bored.

As she hit the concrete, she was weeping. Silent tears streamed down her face, her expression one of utter, exhausted resignation. She *knew* she was going to trip. She had tripped at exactly 2:03 PM every day since October 28th, 1943. She looked at me as the glass reformed in her hand. ""Help me,"" she mouthed. ""I'm stuck in the groove."" Then she walked up the stairs to do it again.

I needed to see more. I needed to know how deep the rot went. I slipped past the woman and entered a house two doors down. The door was unlocked. Inside, the house smelled of roast turkey and furniture polish. The radio was playing a jaunty tune, a commercial for soap. ""It floats!"" the announcer chirped.

I walked into the dining room. A family of four was seated around a table set for Thanksgiving. The father stood at the head of the table, carving knife in hand. He was slicing the turkey. ""Who wants white meat?"" he asked, his voice booming and cheerful. ""Me! Me!"" the two children, a boy and a girl, shouted in unison. The father sliced. The meat fell onto the platter. *SLOOP.* The meat flew back onto the bird. The cut sealed itself. ""Who wants white meat?"" he asked again. Same intonation. Same smile. ""Me! Me!"" the children shouted.

I watched them. The children were skeletal. Not physically, their bodies were plump and healthy. But their eyes... they were sunken, dark circles bruising the skin around them. They were stuck in a loop, just like the woman outside.

I walked up to the mother. She was holding a glass of wine. She raised it to her lips. She took a sip. I saw the wine go down her throat. Then, she gagged. A violent, wet heave. The wine came back up. Not as vomit, but as pure, red liquid. It streamed out of her mouth and back into the glass. ""Delicious,"" she said, wiping her mouth. She looked at me. She didn't stop the loop, but she whispered under the dialogue. ""Kill us,"" she hissed. ""Please. Burn the house down.""

""I... I can't,"" I stammered.

""Then leave,"" she snarled. ""Before the gravy boat resets. It scalds.""

I ran out of the house, the sound of ""Who wants white meat?"" chasing me down the street.

I moved deeper into the town. I found the school. Blackwood Elementary. There were children on the swings. I walked up to the chain-link fence. A boy, maybe ten years old, was at the apex of his swing, high in the air. He wasn't coming down. He was moving, but... agonizingly slow. He was floating, suspended in the amber of this place. He was laughing, but the laugh was distorted, a low, guttural drone that stretched out for minutes. *Haaaaa-haaaaa-haaaaa.*

I walked inside the school. The hallway smelled of chalk dust and floor wax. I looked into a classroom. It was full of third-graders. They were in the middle of the Pledge of Allegiance. Their hands were over their hearts. Their mouths were open. I walked up to a girl in the front row. I waved my hand in front of her face. Her eyes tracked me. That was the worst part. Their bodies were locked in the loop, slaves to the moment the machine turned on. But their minds... their minds were still in there. Awake. Aware. Trapped in a prison of flesh that refused to age. She looked at me with the eyes of an eighty-year-old woman trapped in a child's body. There was no innocence left. Only a deep, festering hatred.

On her desk was a piece of paper. She had been drawing a picture of a house. But in the corner, scribbled so hard the crayon had torn the paper, were words. *IT WON'T STOP. IT WON'T STOP. IT WON'T STOP.* On the blackboard, the teacher had been writing a math problem. The chalk was halfway through a number. I looked at the teacher. He was sweating. But the sweat didn't roll down his face. It just sat there, glistening, preserving his stress for eternity.

I left the classroom. I couldn't handle the eyes. I stumbled into the church next door. St. Jude’s. The doors were open. The pews were full. The priest stood at the pulpit, arms raised in a benediction. The congregation had their heads bowed in prayer. I walked down the aisle. It was quiet here. Too quiet. I realized why. They weren't praying. They were sobbing. Every single person in the pews was weeping. Shoulders shaking, faces buried in hands. But they couldn't stop the prayer. They were locked in the posture of faith, but their minds had long since abandoned God. The priest’s mouth moved. A loop of audio played, faint and tinny. ""...and in His mercy, He shall grant us life everlasting...""

A man in the back row looked up at me. He had clawed his own face. Fresh scratches that healed and reopened every few seconds. ""This is hell,"" he whispered. ""We are the saints of the loop. Save us.""

**\[Narrator takes a long, rasping breath.\]**

I needed a dark place. A place to hide. I saw the marquee of the *Rialto Theater*. **NOW SHOWING: CASABLANCA**. I pushed through the double doors. The lobby smelled of popcorn. Fresh, hot, buttery popcorn. I walked past the concession stand. The popcorn machine was popping, kernels exploding against the glass. But the hopper was full. It never emptied. The kernels popped, fell, and then vanished, reappearing in the kettle to pop again.

I walked into the auditorium. It was pitch black, save for the flickering beam of the projector. The theater was packed. On the screen, Ilsa was asking Sam to play it again. The audience was laughing. It started as a chuckle, then a roar. A synchronous, biological machine noise. Five hundred people laughing at the exact same moment, with the exact same pitch, for the exact same duration. *Ha. Ha. Ha.*

It wasn't laughter. It was a sound file being triggered. I walked down the aisle. I looked at the man in the aisle seat. He was wearing a suit. He was laughing, his mouth wide open. I leaned in close. ""Sir?"" I whispered. He didn't stop laughing. But his hand, resting on the armrest, twitched. His finger pointed to the screen.

I looked up. The film was burning. A black blister bubbled in the center of Humphrey Bogart's face, melting the celluloid. The screen went white. The audience screamed. A synchronized shriek of disappointment. Then, the film snapped back. Bogart’s face healed. The scene restarted. The audience laughed. I ran out of the theater. The sound of that mechanical laughter followed me, echoing in the lobby like a nightmare in a canyon.

I ran out of the theater. I needed something normal. I went to the diner on Main Street. *Sal's Diner.* It was packed. People sat in booths, frozen in conversation. But as I walked in, heads turned. Every single person in the diner stopped their looped conversation and looked at me. The needle scratched off the record.

I sat at the counter next to a man staring at a half-eaten burger. It looked delicious. Fresh lettuce, glistening grease. ""Why don't you eat?"" I asked him, my voice trembling. He looked up at me. He looked like a mechanic. Grease under his nails. Name tag said 'Earl'.

""If I eat it,"" he rasped, ""I can taste it. It goes down. It feels good. But at midnight... it comes back."" He pointed to his stomach. ""Everything resets. If you digest it... the matter has to return to the plate. It rips its way out of you. Or it reforms inside you and you choke on it until the clock ticks over. We learned that the first week. Do not eat. Do not drink. Do not... excrete.""

He leaned in, grabbing my wrist with a grip like iron. ""Do you have... a PowerBar? Or a mint? Something from *Outside*? Something with *time* in it?""

I shook my head, terrified. ""No. I... I left my bag at the entrance.""

He let go, slumping back. ""We can't die,"" he whimpered. ""I shot myself in 1955. I blew my head off with a service revolver. At midnight, the pieces flew back together. I remember the feeling of my skull knitting. I remember the taste of the lead and the gunpowder sucked back into the casing. I remember the bullet sliding back into the gun barrel. It tickled."" He laughed. A broken, jagged sound. ""We are preserved. Like pickles in a jar. But the vinegar is madness.""

A siren wailed. Not an air raid siren. A tone. A low, digital hum that vibrated in my teeth. It sounded like a dial-up modem amplified through a stadium speaker. ""The Doctor wants you,"" Earl said, recoiling. He pointed toward the Town Hall at the end of the street. ""He smells the fresh time on you. He smells the entropy. He smells the decay you carry.""

I went to the Hall. I didn't want to, but the sound was pushing me, guiding me. The Town Hall was a grand, pillared building. Inside, the rotunda had been converted into a makeshift lab. Cables, thick, black, rubber-insulated cables, ran from the floor, snaking up the walls, pulsing with a faint blue light. They looked like veins. They were throbbing, pumping something that wasn't electricity.

Sitting behind a desk in the center of the chaos was a man in a lab coat that was stained with eighty years of coffee and ink. He looked like Oppenheimer's nightmare. Gaunt, intense, vibrating with a manic energy. His hair was wild, white shocks standing up. ""Dr. Vance?"" I asked. I’d read the name on the redacted file. *Lead Physicist: Dr. Julian Vance.*

""You're late,"" he snapped. He didn't look up from a notebook he was furiously scribbling in. The pages were black with graphite, written over and over and over again. ""Eighty-two years late. Did Einstein send you? Did he send the equation for the decoherence variance?""

""Einstein is dead,"" I said. ""He died a long time ago. 1955.""

Vance stopped writing. The pencil snapped in his hand. He looked up. A single tear leaked from his eye. It moved at normal speed. ""Dead? He got out? He... finished?""

""He lived a full life,"" I said. ""Sir, what is this place? Why are you... why is everyone...""

Vance laughed. It was a dry, hacking sound, like dry leaves crunching. ""This is the pause button, my boy. Project Aion. We wanted to create a tactical advantage. A way to freeze a battlefield, move our troops into position, and unfreeze it. The ultimate ambush. We turned on the Chronosphere on October 28th, 1943. We created a closed loop. A perfect circle. Nothing decays here. Entropy is forbidden. We are the same atoms, cycling forever. We solved death, my boy! We cured it!""

""This isn't a cure,"" I said, thinking of the weeping woman, the screaming silent children. ""It's a prison. And it's broken. Why are some people stuck in loops? Why did the lady trip over and over?""

Vance grimaced. ""Skips. The machine... it has a buffer. A twenty-four hour buffer. It records, and at the end of the cycle, it rewrites. But heavy events... trauma... kinetic energy... they create scratches in the record. The machine tries to process the fall, fails, and resets just that local area until the main buffer clears. They are 'skips' on the vinyl of reality.""

""Can't you turn it off?""

""The machine is in the bunker beneath us,"" Vance said, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""It... fused. It drew power from the tectonic plates. It’s not just a machine anymore. It’s a puncture wound in the universe. A scab. And we are the bacteria trapped under it.""

He stood up and walked toward me. He moved strangely, jerky, fast. He sniffed me. He inhaled deeply, his eyes rolling back in his head. ""You,"" he whispered. ""Oh, god... *you*.""

""What?""

""Your cells are dividing,"" he moaned in ecstasy. ""I can hear them. Their life spans shortening. The oxidation. It’s like a symphony. You’re aging. You’re dying. You’re... *happening*."" He touched my face with cold, trembling fingers. ""I need your battery.""

I slapped his hand away. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""You brought *time* in with you,"" Vance said, his eyes widening, scanning me like I was a piece of meat. ""You’re a fresh vessel. A chaotic element. If we hook you into the Chronosphere... your entropy... your potential for decay... it might be enough to shock the system. To jumpstart the flow. We could ride your timeline out. We could break the loop.""

""You want to kill me?"" I backed away, hitting the desk.

""I want to *die*!"" Vance screamed, slamming his fists onto the table. ""I want to rot! I want to turn to dust! I have been thirty-five years old for eight decades! I have had the same conversation with my wife every morning for twenty-nine thousand days! I want to end! I want to be forgotten!"" He grabbed a scalpel from the desk. ""Give me your mortality! Give me your death!""

He lunged for me. For a scientist, he was strong. But he was fighting with the frantic desperation of a man who hasn't slept in a century. I was fighting with pure adrenaline. I shoved him back. He hit the desk, scattering his notes. He stood, clutching his side in pain.

""It’s almost midnight!"" he shrieked, his eyes bulging, veins popping in his neck.

""It's 2:00 PM!"" I yelled back, pointing at the window where the sun hadn't moved an inch.

""Internal clock!"" Vance spat, foam forming at the corners of his mouth. ""The buffer is full! The Reset is coming! Stay! Watch the Reset! You’ll see! You’ll never want to leave! You'll see the gears of god grinding us down!""

I didn't wait to hear more. I ran.

I burst out of the Town Hall. The sky had changed. It wasn't night. The sun hadn't set. Instead, the sky had turned a bruising purple, the color of a hematoma. The air was vibrating, a sub-bass thrum that made my vision swim. The townspeople were gathering in the street.

This is the part that haunts me. The ""skips"" had stopped. The woman wasn't tripping anymore. The man wasn't watering his lawn. The children weren't swinging. Because the system was about to crash, the local loops had unlocked. They had five minutes of freedom. Five minutes of lucidity before the end. And they were using it to prepare for the pain. They weren't panicking. They were bracing themselves. They held onto lampposts, to each other, to the hydrants. They lay flat on the pavement, gripping the curbs. They knew what was coming.

""Get down!"" the woman who tripped screamed at me from her porch. She was clinging to the railing with both hands. ""Anchor yourself! Or it will tear you apart!""

I grabbed a park bench, gripping the cold iron legs until my knuckles turned white. ""What happens?"" I yelled over the rising hum.

""The rubber band snaps back!"" she cried, looking at the purple sky with terror. ""The buffer clears!""

And then, the world ended.

It wasn't a fade to black. It wasn't a seamless transition. It was violence. The sky ripped open. I saw... I saw gears. I saw math. I saw the raw coding of reality tearing apart. Fractal patterns of light burned into my retinas. My body felt like it was being pulled through a cheese grater. Every step I had taken in the town, every breath I had inhaled, tried to undo itself. I felt the air rushing out of my lungs to return to where it was hours ago. My footprints on the grass tried to lift me up and carry me backward.

The woman who tripped, I watched her body contort. Her bones snapped and twisted as she was dragged physically backward to her porch. Her jaw unhinged as she screamed a scream that was sucked back into her throat. The man who watered the lawn was dragged across the asphalt by an invisible hook, his fingernails leaving gouges in the street as his skin shredded, only to heal instantly as he landed back in his spot by the hose.

Pain. Infinite, white-hot pain. My mind felt like it was being put in a blender. I saw my memories of the last few hours playing in reverse, superimposed over my vision. I saw myself entering the town, hiking the woods, driving the car... all flashing in a chaotic staccato.

And then... *snap*.

Silence. Blue sky. The sun at 2:00 PM.

The woman stood on her porch. She was holding the tray of lemonade. She was crying. ""Please,"" she whispered. ""Kill us.""

I checked my watch. 2:03 PM.

I had survived the loop. But I felt... heavy. My joints clicked. My vision blurred for a second. My chest ached, a deep, hollow throb. I had to get out. I sprinted for the perimeter. The transition point. I could see the shimmering distortion in the air where the pine trees turned from 1943 perfection to muddy reality.

Vance was behind me. He was standing on the Town Hall steps, screaming, his face contorted in a mask of pure envy and hate.

""DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?"" he roared. ""YOU CAN'T KEEP IT! YOU SPENT IT! YOU PAID THE TOLL!""

I didn't know what he meant. I didn't care. I dove through the shimmer.

I hit the mud. The smell of rot and wet earth filled my nose. It was the most beautiful smell in the world. I gasped, sucking in the cold, damp air. I was out. I rolled onto my back, laughing hysterically. I checked my gear. My GoPro was dead. My Geiger counter was clicking furiously, but not for radiation. It was clicking in a rhythmic, ticking pattern, almost like a clock.

I stood up to begin the hike back. My knees buckled. A sharp, grinding pain shot up my legs. I fell back into the mud. ""Cramps,"" I muttered. ""Just cramps.""

I forced myself up. I began to walk. The first mile was agony. My breath came in ragged wheezes. I felt... frail. By the second mile, I noticed my hands. I was gripping a trekking pole, and the skin on my knuckles was loose. Wrinkled. I stopped. I rubbed my face. My skin felt papery. I pulled a strand of hair from my head.

It was gray.

Panic, cold and absolute, set in. I started to run, or try to. I shambled. I was a thirty-year-old man moving with the gait of a pensioner. By the time I reached my car, hidden under the tarp five miles away, I was coughing up blood. I looked in the rearview mirror and screamed. The face staring back at me wasn't mine. It was my grandfather's. Deep grooves etched into the forehead. Crow's feet that looked like canyons. My hair was a thinning shock of white.

I drove. I drove fast. I didn't care about the speed limit. I didn't care about the police. By the time I hit the interstate, my teeth felt loose. One fell out when I bit into a protein bar. I spat it into my hand, a perfect, healthy molar, rooted in a gum that had receded by decades.

By the time I reached the hospital in D.C., I was sixty.

The doctors didn't understand. They quarantined me. They thought it was a rapid-onset pathogen. A new virus. But one old doctor, a military specialist with a clearance badge I didn't recognize, came in. He didn't ask what happened. He didn't ask for my insurance. He just asked where I went. ""Blackwood,"" I wheezed.

He nodded. He knew.

He sat by my bed an hour ago. He explained it to me. ""Time is a currency, son,"" he said, looking at my charts with pity. ""You entered a vacuum. A place with no time. To exist there, to move, to think, to breathe... you had to bring your own. You were the battery.""

""I was only there... for a day,"" I rasped. My voice sounded like Vance's now. Dusty. Old.

""The exchange rate is high,"" he said softly. ""The town needed entropy. It needed to feed. It drank your future to sustain its present. Every second you spent there cost you a year of your life.""

He showed me the mirror one last time. I am 115 years old. My organs are shutting down. My skin is tearing under its own weight. My liver has failed. My kidneys are dust.

**\[The sound of a long, piercing electronic whine fills the room. A flatline. Voices scream instructions. ""Clear!"" A thud. Static.\]**

**\[RECORDING TERMINATED\]**

*But here is the twist. Here is the thing that makes me scream silently in this bed.*

*I’m not dying. I can see the doctors and nurses working frantically to revive me… It won’t work.*

*The darkness isn't coming. The light isn't coming. The air in the hospital room is changing. The smell of antiseptic is fading. It smells like... fresh-cut grass. And gasoline. And lemon pledge.*

*I hear a whistle. Off-key. I hear the sound of a hose spraying water.*

*I finally understand what Vance meant. He didn't just want my entropy to break the loop. He wanted to trade. He knew that for the loop to continue, it needed a fresh anchor. A new battery. And for him to finally die, to finally get the release he screamed for, he needed someone to take his place.*

*He spent my future to buy his death. And in exchange, he bequeathed me his prison.*

*I’m not going to heaven. I’m not going to hell. I'm being pulled back. The ""skip"" in the record isn't done with me.*

*I’m going back to 2:00 PM.*

*I can see the porch steps. They look so clean. So white.*

*And I think... I think I’m going to be the one who trips.*

I really need some honest advice because I’m starting to feel discouraged.

I started Amazon Affiliate about two weeks ago and I’m trying to drive traffic through Pinterest. My niche is home décor / interior aesthetics. I’m creating all my content using AI images (bedrooms, coffee corners, kitchen organization, etc.) because I don’t have the ability to take real photos.

I post consistently, I optimize my titles and keywords, I make aesthetic pins, but I still have 0 clicks and 0 sales. Not even one click on the link, which makes me feel like something is seriously wrong with my strategy.

Here’s my situation:
My niche is home/interior aesthetics
I use AI images for my pins
I tried showing room ideas, organization hacks, aesthetic setups
I link to Amazon products (organizers, décor, coffee machines, etc.)
I post a few times a day
Still… no traction at all

I’m not expecting overnight success, but after two weeks with no clicks at all, I feel like I’m missing something important.

My questions:
1.	Is AI content hurting my reach on Pinterest?
2.	Do I need a website/blog instead of linking directly to Amazon?
3.	Should I switch niches or stay consistent?
4.	Does it usually take longer than two weeks to get even small traction?
5.	Any Pinterest-specific tips for someone relying on AI images?

Any advice or experience would honestly help me a lot. I’m really trying and I don’t want to give up too early, but I’m exhausted and confused. Thank you in advance 💛",3,1764745679.0,Pinterestmarketing,2,1.0,False

The machine is a DeLonghi Linea Classic EM450.
Portafilter is a Fogkay 51mm with the basket it shipped with from Amazon. I'm using a Baratza Encore ESP with this thanks to a good friend getting me one.
Prior to this I was using the stock pressurized baskets in the stock portafilter and Stumptown grocery store coffee (I live in the PNW so at least it's local to me lol) and getting passable results. Not the best as straight espresso but great as a cortado or a latte. Now that I have a good grinder and can see the results, I'm feeling like I'm able to start trying to dial in shots. This was 18g on grind size 18 with a ""medium"" roast that's probably as close to a dark roast before the beans start to sweat oil. Taste was fair, a bit sour on the nose but not unbearable. Finish was bitter but again, not unbearable. Texture was quite good. Thick enough and nice velvety texture. Very little as far as complexity, but I attribute this to the beans more than anything. I don't have an espresso scale yet but that's the next thing on my list as I want an easier thing to manage other than trying to use my phone as a timer at 5:30 in the morning when trying to remember to take notes on the weight in and out plus time lol I'm managing, but not well when I first wake up. I'm finding more fresly roasted coffee a lot more difficult to dial in. Flow is too slow, grind more coarse and tey again, now it's too bitter so I take some mass out at the previous grind size now the flow is good but it's overly sour. It's definitely frustrating and say harder than I thought ot would be to get outstanding shots, but I think I'm learning something from each adjustment.

I am 15(ftm). I never really had privacy growing up, I always had to share a room with a younger sibling, 10(female). Which is understandable when you grow up with little space. Another sibling 11(male) got a room to himself. This was a few years ago so when I was about 13 and my siblings would have been 9 and 8.
About a year ago my dad got married to a lovely woman who made much, much more money than he even had (she's a lawyer). So we moved in with her because there was more space. However, there was another person who moved in before I got the chance to finally have a room to myself, so I ended up sharing with my two siblings in the basement. 
Said person helps with my older step-sister who has special needs. Recently she has been kicked out due to taking advantage of the people around her and overall being a bad person. So, I was hoping that when she finally moved out, I would get the room.
Instead, it was decided I would once again have to share a room with one of my siblings, while the other gets the entire basement to himself. Apparently because the younger two don't get along.
I don't find this fair, at all. The basement is frankly large enough to split the two apart in the one room without issues, but instead they want to cram me in a room with my sister, which is much smaller. 
So not only do I have to share a room, but basically I have to go back to the same homelife I used to be stuck it, with one child getting the biggest room and I have to share with the other. 
Before my parents told me that the room would be shared, they joked it would just be for plants. Just a space for the two of them, despite already having the biggest room in the house and a plant nook. They also tend to buy themselves stuff all the time (lots of mugs, coffee, personal wants, fast food when they don't want to cook). 
Yes they get stuff for us too, but they still favor my step sister over me and my siblings because of her special needs, which I get. But a lot of the time when they're ordering things for themselves, they'll just make me make freezer food (pizza rolls, chicken nuggets, etc.) 
Basically I'm just pissed that my parents always fucking forget about my own privacy.

1pcxilt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcxilt,Coffee spill on MacBook Air M3. The inside looks clean. Am I saved?,"I accidentally spilled a small amount of black coffee on the right side of my MacBook Air M3 keyboard (near the power button). I wiped it immediately, flipped it over, and put it in a tent position to dry. When I flipped it, a bit of coffee actually dripped out onto the table.

Before opening it up, I accidentally turned it on twice and it booted normally both times with no issues. After a few hours I opened the MacBook to check inside, and I found one small trace of coffee on the top-right corner of the back side near the charging port. I wiped that off, and other than that there were no signs of liquid anywhere: logic board, battery, or frame all look clean and dry. I attached photos in the post.

I left it in a tent position overnight (about 16 hours since the spill). This morning I pressed the keys around the spill area and they feel just a little bit sticky, I am going to try and clean them with 99.9% IPA.

How do I get over being Cucked?,"  So this is pretty hard for me to talk about.But I wanted to see what you all had to say , so here it is. I ( M48)was cucked by my ""then"" fiancee with a few of my acquaintances. It's been over 20 years and I still feel the pain. The laughter the smiles are burned into my memory. 
   I was 21 when I met her. I had a thing for karaoke bars. They were pretty big in the early two thousands. And if you had a decent voice , you had a good chance to pick up somebody. Lord knows how many nights I walked out of one of the karaoke bars or just some regular bar that had karaoke, with some unknown female on my arm going home. If I knew then what i know now I would have stayed in my apartment that night. There's one sports bar that I constantly went to for karaoke almost every Friday night. I would go sit in the corner booth, with my journal in a sketch pad. At that time , I had a few people on hung with, but most of the time , I was by myself. That night was different. I got to the sports bar and it was already packed at nine thirty. For this place that's really odd. Normally , it wouldn't get packed until around eleven. There was no pool tournaments , nothing sports wise big being played. It was just full. The place had this vibe all most. So I made it to my corner booth. Surprisingly no one had taken it yet. Karaoke d j ( let's call him Sam) had just got there and started setting up. We spoke briefly , we knew each other fairly well. He handed me a book cause he knew I was going to ask for one and we laughed. At the time I had a thing for smoking, menthol, lights and drinking corona with line. After about an hour , the place was really jumping.  The normal crew that would chill with me on Fridays showed up. We sung and drank till somewhere after 1230 I hear this voice.  GOD DAMN THAT VOICE, singing "" Black Velvet "" sent chills down my spine, my heart started pounding hard as hell.  I remember sitting in the middle of the U shape booth writing something trying to impress some chick when I heard her. I didn't look up, but I did stop my writing. Pretending to ponder about what I was writing, but actually listening to this voice. As she hit her last few notes I looked up slowly, not to draw any attention away from the females I was with. She looked at me smiled this little innocent smile, I nodded and smiled back. Surprisingly I was called up next to sing.  Sam looked at me and asked if I wanted to sing what I had on my paper ( My Own Prison, it was still big in 2000) or did I want to do my ,as he called it make them wet song, Purple Rain? Now I not one to sit her and say I was the best but I could carry a tune. I started singing in church choirs at age nine. Continue to sing in the middle school chorus. Singing through course in high school. So I could sing fairly decent. But that night oh after hearing her I had to bring my A game.  I looked at Sam and told him Purple Rain, and I killed it. About 15 mins after I sung she came over with a bucket of beer. She had this commanding presence about her, but this underlay of mischief.  She was 5,5 kind of thick, in that you can tell she was use to doing physical work type body. She had mid back length jet Blake hair, a red and white baseball shirt, fitted blue jeans and a pair of hand painted skull and bones Doc Martins. She asks my name before I could even say a word. I gave her my name and asked for hers in return let's call her Lynn. So i ask Ed she would like to sit, and of course before I could finish my sentence she had sat down. Moving one of the other females that was there out of the way so she could sit closer so we could talk. She Surprised me with her straight forwardness. We both went back to sing a few more times before the place kicked us out. i did get her number before I left and promised to call the next day.
 The next day I called ss promised somewhere around late evening. We made plans to meet up that night at another little hole in the wall place. Also another spot sam would be. That night , we all drank sang , drink some more sang some more until the place closed. That night Sam invited us all back over to his place for an after party. It ended up being 10 of us sitting in his backyard around campfire , singing to someone playing a guitar, cracking jokes , telling stories and making out. Sometime early morning , she decided to head out and asked if I wanted to come. Of course I did. So I followed her back to her apartment.\nWe proceeded to have some pretty wild early morning fueled sex. We both fell asleep and was woken up around noon by a guy pounding on the door telling her hes off to work. I looked at her with the scard puzzled look and she laughed. She told me it was in of her roommates.  She lived in a 4 bedroom condo with 3 other people. After we got showered a quick in the shower, dressed and down the stairs to find all of her roommates standing around the island clapping and smacking moaning. Sounds. I laughed took a cup of coffee that was offered said my goodbyes and we were out the door. Two months later they got evicted for one of the roommates smoking weed and the nabor called the cops on them. So I moved her in with me.
 Now, she did tell me that she had a little girl like the very next day.She told me about her little girl. This little girl was living with her father overseas. Lynn use to be in the Army and her daughter (let's call her Rose) was born on base over seas while Lynn was married when rose was born and was divorced the year after. Her Ex was also in the army. I never asked why they were divorced.I never asked why she left her daughter overseas. It never dawned on me to ask those type of questions. So after a year of her fighting to get her daughter back she wins and we fly overseas and bring her back to the states to live with us.
  Two years fly by she picks up being a karaoke d j and she does well at it. I did hate the fact that she lugged that heavy as equipment around in my nissan , altima. I had so many scratches and dings from where that equipment was so heavy She would flop it on the hood of the car. But she did enjoy it and I supported her. She would DJ tuesday nights , friday , night's saturday , night and every other sunday. Which meant most nights are stayed at home with Rose.  I work in a the warehouse doing the daytime so most nights I need my sleep. Sh DJed nights so it was OK. Well I thought  it was OK. Mid spring she planned a trip for us to Tennessee and hinted it would be a nice place to be proposed to. A month later I package arrived at the house for me . I hadn't ordered anything and I had been cut off from my family ( due to them not liking her. Whole other story) so i knew it wasn't from them. Inside was a note and a box with an antique ring with a 1 crt. Square cut emerald. All the notes said it was I thought you might need this, and it was signed with the letter H. Looking at it all I could think of was this was perfect.  Yes I was dumb and very naive. The trip was set for October so I had plenty of time to prepare. 
  Around July i noticed things changed gradually but I couldn't put my finger on it. I was used to the smell of alcohol and cigarettes. There was a different smell that night. Whatever it was it mad me itch. You know that itch thst omenunder your skin thats telling you something is not right but you know its right there. Some nights after she would leave the bar some of my so called friends would come by and we would sit on the back patio and drink, laugh and just cut up. So it wasn't unusual for them to come by and some time pass oit drunk on our couch. That night just one of the crew came to the house. It was normal around 4 to 6 people.  Normally at least 2 girls in the group beside Lynn. That night nope just him. (Let's call him Dee) Dee came un like he always did laughing and always cracking  joke. I remember we heard about two beers together and my head started pound. After about twenty minutes of that , I told him i'm going to bed , he could crash the couch. Lynn came in brought me a warm towel for my head and a bottle of water. She went to bed with me and held me till I passed out. I do.t think it took long at all. I remember waking up around 7 to Rose asking for pancakes and that's when I realized Lynn wasn't in the bed. I got up walk down the hall, leaving Rose to watch cartoons on my bed. As I turned the corner I see her sitting down on her knees beside the couch and hes laying on the couch. I couldnt tell what was going on or what they were talking about but i could tell something wasnt right.  They saw me she didn't move he threw up his hand to say was up.  She waited till i csme in the living room before she got up to kiss me on the cheek and say good morning.  I walked in the kitchen , it started cooking pancakes bacon in eggs. I was fixing coffee , he gets up off the couch and walks over to me. He thanks me for letting him crash the couch and that's when I noticed his pants was unzipped. I told him it's fly was down. He laughed and said it was probably for when he went to use the bathroom and zipped up his pants.
  Couple of days later , the whole crew is back at the house. We were all sitting on the patio having some more drinks, when the 1st real hint happened. One of the females asked Lynn how did she like that protein shake she had the other morning. Questioned her what protein shake? When did she get in a drinking protein shake? Me not really thinking about it. She laughed and said it was a mix that Dee had given.  Now Dee was known for alway tryimg to get someone to buy supplements and vitamins from him.He worked for GNC at the time. So , it really didn't register , but I knew it wasn't right.
  Another month goes by this time the female( let's call her Rachel) and Dee and Cowboy come home early for the bar. Fire marshal shut the play down for being over capacity. They came in.We hit drinks like normal on\nCe again after about an hour or so , my head started to hurt.i told Lynn to jist chill i will be fine go hang with everyone.  I woke up around five o'clock to find Rachel and Dee on my pull out couch Cowboy was on the back porch swing and Lynn on the hammock both asleep. I mad my way back to the kitchen to get me some water and tylenol I noticed a few condom wrappers in the trash. I figured it was Dee and Rachel.  But that itch hit me again and I knew something wasn't right. 
   Later that day after everyone got up I made a joke about them in the trash and she flinched then laughed. They all started laughing.  But not with me but.more so at me. And I knew it. For se reason I knew it but I couldn't put my finger on it. Later everyone went home.The day went on as normal. I don't think anything else was said about it. At least not that day , but I do recall it coming up the next day. She joked about seeing them and how she wanted to wake me up.  But I knew thst part was a lie. So I asked her so what did you do? She said her and Cowboy left them inside and went to the patio to give them space. And I know most of you are probably wondering where Rose was during all of this? Buy this time , her father moved back to the states and would get her everything other weekend. So no the child was not at home for crazy nights. 
  October rolled around even though I knew something wasn't right i proposed anyway.  I didn't lose anything by doing it. I got the ring mysteriously through the mail. We have paid overtime for the trip. So why not if things went bad I wouldn't lose a thing. So I thought.  December rolls around  and I had to go out of town for training my job paid for me to go to. I come home a day early.  I had not only finished i had won an award as well. So when I walked into my house that night at 6 instead of the next morning at 9 I thought she would be happy. But she wasn't Rachel and Cowboy were there and you could tell they were giving fake pleasantries. I go put my stuff down, tell her I'm getting to me a shower.I want to get the road off of me. She fires back with do whatever you want i don't care. Shocked kind of looked at her funny and asked if she was okayShocked kind of looked at her funny and asked if she was okay , she says she didn't want to talk about. I got my shower got dressed and went back to the living room with everyone else. They had already ordered Pizza and were eating when I arrived in the living room. There were 2 pieces of Pizza left.They offered them to me , and I ate them not thinking. But after about two or three chews I excused myself say I needed to pee. The pizza tasted funny. I knew something wasn't right. When I came back they were on the patio talking low. But I could make out anything. I took the rest of the pizza and flushed it before they could see. But it was to late I started to get sleepy. Not all at once just like a curtain being slowly drawn. Till I was out. When I came to 2 hours later groggy. I knew they had done something.  I carried a S&M 357 Magnum when I traveled and I hadn't taken it out of my bag when I got home. So I knew it was in the room with me instead of being in its lock box. I pulled it out of my with one thing in my mind.  If I catch them in the act im going to put 6 holes in someone.  Ass I walk around the corner to the living room I could see Dee under Lynn and Cowboy thrusting into her mouth. Rachel was already used up. Laying on the island asleep with one of their fluids on her face. The rage of felt the pain I felt my vision started to go red. And slowly faded into a tunnel , I remember raising my gun , I remember pulling the trigger six times but it didn't fire. I knew it had rounds in it. I had just put them in there before walking down the hall. So I pulled the trigger again six more times and not one fired. Dee threw Lynn off grabbing his pants and running and Cowboy laughed and kept thrusting. He said he knew I would get up , but I wouldn't be up for long. And no sooner than he could say that i felt it. That feeling of a heavy blanket being draped over you when your body is too tired to move. When the adrenaline is so heavy , your heart beat is so fast. You breathe and becomes fast and irregular. Then the lights go out and you're sleeping again. I slept for another four more hours. When I woke up, he was gone.She had cleaned up and she sat there with a smirk on her face.
  My heart was broken.I was angry.All I could do was pack my stuff. I asked why and never got a response. There's a packed i checked my rounds again and sure enough.They were still good. What's I got my car loaded with what I could take I went to the shooting range. I inspected my going, checked the rounds.Replace them in the cylinder and fired all six shots. No problem, all 6 rounds shot perfectly and hit the mark I was expecting to hit. ToTo this day , I say it was divine blessing and god's hand keeping that gun from going off. Now , whether if the blessing was for them or for me , i'm not for sure. I wanna think more for me.
   Three weeks later , I went back to get the rest  my stuff. We spoke a few times after I never went back to her. She did come over to my apartment twice to fuck. A treat her like the whore she was. Shown no mercy at all. The last time we had sex was that my old apartment , I told her she had to park down the street because they were in the process of getting ready to redo the pavement in my complex. And she did. After aggressively fucked her silly , taking out all the rage I possibly could on her without harming her i kicked her out and just her underwear and made her walk back to her car.
  Since i went through relationships like they were a game. I did a lot of females dirty. I broke a lot of good ladies hearts. I did meet the right lady and settled down. Married now 18 years

So i bought a Redragon K686 HE, with hall effect switches. And I modded it as best as I possibly could. 
Swapped the keycaps for a Womier Coffee Cat MOA switches (the XDA version was out of stock on their website so I had to turn to their AliExpress page and found them in MOA). I also bought him a nice wooden knob to fit in with the theme. Also seeing as how he will be probably using this keyboard instead of his laptop one the MOA switches will make a cool transition which won’t feel too unfamiliar or uncomfortable.
Then I remembered - I work in the printed advertising industry - why don’t I make a cool vinyl wrap for the underside of the case and add some more vinyl on the inside to make the keyboards sound better?
So I did. Made a design, printed, laminated and wrapped it. 
And to finish the look I also added a braided coiled beige USB-C cable which has an aviator connector similar to some old GX style cables. 
And this is the finished product. What do you think ? ",5,1764744632.0,BudgetKeebs,6,0.78,False

Title: The same right place.

We lived under the red star, and the star never blinked.

My name doesn’t matter. In the village they still call me by my father’s name, and that is enough.

I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.

Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. Children walked alone. That was the rule. He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. He didn’t speak. Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.

I remember the sun flashing on the metal. Then the world went red. I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air,

“Why? Why did you hit me? What did I ever do to you?” The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.

I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.

I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs. Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges. The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.

He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.

Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs. I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.

The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.

A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.

I stood up behind them.

The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. He dropped like a sack of maize. His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.

I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.

Then I ran.

It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.

My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm. Then she started hitting. Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” She slammed my head against the walls. I felt warm blood running down my back. I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. Pain had lost all meaning. Life had never had any value for me until that night.

My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. He tried to pull her off. She bit his wrist. He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.

The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.

My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.

“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.” Fear I had never seen before was painted across his face.

I told him everything. The pipe when I was nine. The laugh behind the bus station. The sound the skull made when it finally gave.

He listened without blinking. Then he sat for five, maybe ten minutes, staring at the blank wall.

“Tell me exactly where this happened. Tell me everything again.”

I told him again. “Behind the last train station on line 201. Just fifty metres farther.”

“And the pipe?”

“I threw it in the garbage container at the station.”

He stood, carried my mother to the bedroom, closed the door, and came back.

“Shower. Put all the clothes in a bag. And go to sleep.”

I stood under the water until my skin wrinkled. I thought about the window—fourth floor, quick. Thought about the belt—quiet. Thought about swimming out until the cold took me and the militia wrote “accidental drowning,” the way they did for everyone who disappeared.

I decided the sea would be cleaner.

I never slept.

At 05:47 the front door opened again. My father came in alone. His boots left half-moon prints of wet sand and black earth across the linoleum. He smelled of salt, pine disinfectant, and something sweeter—the chemical they used in the morgue when bodies waited too long. He went to the bedroom first. Stayed a few minutes. I could hear him speaking low to my mother. He came out with his eyes empty.

He started the coffee. I walked in.

“No school today.”

I nodded.

“This is the biggest mistake you will ever make in your life.”

“I’m sorry, father.”

“Too late.” He lit a Carpați with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking. “His parents will never see him again. The army will write ‘desertion.’ Nobody will ever know what happened to him. You will never speak of this—not to your wife, not to your children, not in the confession booth, not on your deathbed. Never.”

He drank the coffee standing up, put on his factory jacket, and left for the morning shift.

Just another Tuesday under the red star.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek.

She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again. It never came.

Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said.

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”

The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.

“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.

The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.

Forty-three years passed. The regime died choking on its own flags. I married, had children, watched them grow up in a country that pretended it had never been afraid.

My father died first. Heart attack on the exact spot of the hidden beach where he once buried a boy. They found him face-down in the sand, one hand clutching a brown hat he had kept since 1956.

At the wake my mother pulled me into the same kitchen. She was eighty-three, thin as a winter branch.

“He wasn’t dead when your father got there,” she whispered. “Barely breathing, but the eyes were still moving. Your father pressed one heavy hand over the boy’s mouth and nose until the eyes stopped moving. Carried him farther down the cliff and covered him with rocks, sand, and quicklime from the collective. He went back three nights to make sure the dogs didn’t dig.”

She lit one of his old cigarettes with a match that trembled the way his hands had trembled every morning for forty-three years.

“He saw that boy’s face every single night until the day he died. Every night. Even after the wall came down. Even after they gave us passports and blue jeans and Coca-Cola. That face never left him.”

She inhaled until the coal burned her fingers. Then she stubbed it out on the same table where she had once beaten me for bleeding.

Three days after the funeral my mother placed a small wooden box on the kitchen table.

Same table. Same cracks. Same ghosts.

“Open it,” she said. “He wanted you to have this when I was gone too.”

I lifted the lid.

On top lay a yellowed newspaper from 1962. Front page. A grainy photograph of a young man in uniform, headphones around his neck, fingers flying over a Morse key. The headline screamed in red ink: BEST TELEGRAPHIST OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC – AN EXAMPLE FOR THE YOUTH!

His name underneath. My father at nineteen. The same eyes that could freeze a room without a word.

Under the paper: an Orex automatic watch stopped forever at 03:17. A stack of black-and-white photos. Father as a boy near the Russian border, barefoot in the snow, holding a dead hare twice his size.

Father in Moscow, 1964, standing stiff beside Red Square, medals he never wore again.

Father drunk at a wedding, smiling in a way I had never seen in life.

And at the bottom, folded small so it wouldn’t tear, the medical report from 1955.

I knew the story, but never the paper.

He was fifteen. Working the collective fields up north, near the Soviet border where winters eat men. A tractor turned too sharp. The driver didn’t see the boy behind. The blade caught him across the head and peeled the scalp clean off like the skin of an orange.

They carried what was left of him home on a door. The doctor told the family: “Prepare the hole.”

They dug it that same evening. Carved a wooden cross. Wrote his name, the dates 1940–1955.

Three nights later he opened his eyes.

He never spoke about the dark he saw. Only once, drunk on plum brandy when I was twelve, he told me the cold had felt like home.

After that he drank every day, but never raised a hand.

The anger lived in his eyes instead—grey, flat, impossible to meet for more than a split second. People crossed the street when he walked. Even the militia looked away.

He spoke Russian and French like a native, could solve equations in his head faster than the engineers at the factory, but he chose the dirtiest job on the line. Twelve-hour shifts, oil up to the elbows, far from any Party office that might remember the newspaper photograph.

He wanted to disappear.

The regime had made him a hero once. He spent the rest of his life running from the medal.

I turned the watch over. On the back, scratched with a nail decades ago:

Я ВИДЕЛ (Ya videl) I saw.

Mother watched me read it.

“He learned Russian in Moscow,” she said. “Six months attached to a signals unit. They taught him the language and how to hate it. When he came home he never spoke it again—except when he was drunk and crying in his sleep. Then it was always the same two words.”

She took the newspaper, smoothed it with her palm as if she could still flatten the past.

“He never hit you,” she said.

“Never. Even when you deserved it. Even after that night on the cliff. He carried enough for both of you.”

I closed the box.

That evening I walked to the cemetery. The grave was fresh, the earth still black. I opened the Orex, wound it once, twice. The second hand jerked, then moved. 03:17 became 03:18.

Somewhere under the soil he was still counting.

I left the watch on the mound. Let time keep walking for him now.

When I got home the wind had come in from the sea, carrying the smell of salt, pine, and something metallic underneath.

I stood on the balcony and listened. For the first time in forty-three years I heard two sounds at once: the pipe finding the exact same place, and a telegraph key tapping out a message no one would ever answer.

I go to the cliffs sometimes. The path is overgrown now. Tourists come for the view and never know that a young man lies dead beneath their feet.

I still wonder why he did it. What demons made him grab that pipe and break my head?

I know my demons sleep now, but they visit me in my dreams.

Are his parents still alive? Does anyone else still think of him?

Or am I the only one left carrying him?

When the wind is right I still hear it: the sound a pipe makes when it finds the exact same place twice.

Under communism we learned that some debts cannot be paid. They can only be passed on.

And the red star is gone. But the night remembers everything.

We cook more, we don't do frivolous shopping. I've cut my coffee costs in half with making my own at home. Where I've previously went once a month or once every pay period to buy books, I went 4 months straight without stepping foot into a bookstore to spend. This is just a few examples on how we've cut costs and changed our habits.

We get paid bi-weekly. However, if we went by our total monthly income (about $2500) ideally we wouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck. We would have a wiggle room of about $600 leftover. With this disposable amount, we could easily start putting aside for savings, an emergency fund, and so on.

So why is it whenever the $1250 paycheck hits, we're spending almost to zero on bills alone? Even now we're running the risk of an NSF fee because of the timing of bills coming out. I genuinely believe that we are struggling more right now than when we didn't have a spending plan, and that's backwards.

I'm trying not to doxx myself or my husband, but hopefully this is enough information for people to give advice. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",0,1764743701.0,budget,9,0.5,False

As I sit here on my couch watching some tv show I’m not fully invested in, I figured I’d try once again at reaching out to make a new friend. I’ve recently moved to a new state and know no one here. I like my solitude sure, but I really enjoy engaging with people. I think we as humans need socialization. Whether that’s something we want to admit to ourselves or not is another matter. 😅 Personally, I genuinely enjoy talking with others about their interests, hobbies, jobs, etc.

As for me, as you’ve probably heard numerous times over, I am an open book. We can literally talk about the dumbest shit ever and I’d still find it interesting, because, well…YOU’RE interesting.

I myself enjoy reading, I’m really big on mythology and history. I also enjoy coffee, but not like just drinking it. I like the science and math behind it all. I’m kind of a geek when it comes to it honestly. I roast when I can, and my espresso machine is my baby. I collect vinyls (or records, but I’m not snooty about it haha) and I have a few vintage comics I’ve collected at one point or another. I game too, but mostly single player games, not really multiplayer (like I said, I don’t have much friends haha). I enjoy indie and horror movies mostly, but I’ll watch just about anything (bonus points if you’ve watched the title of my post.) Oh! And I have a dog too! He is my best friend and I’d do anything for him…

Aaaaaanywho, I guess, I’ll leave it at that with all this and that about me stuff. But what about you? What song can’t you get enough of right now? What was the last movie you saw? Why are you REALLY here? Inquiring minds would like to know. If you’d like to talk or shoot the shit sometime, I’m always open. Feel free to reach out anytime…or not, it’s really no biggi, just take care of yourself. 😌",1,1764743657.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

The only reason I moved to pour over is because the regular cowboy coffee intake increased my cholesterol quite a bit. It wasn’t for the taste, maybe because I wasn’t aware of what to look for. 

Even with pour over, I never really bothered about the taste because I thought that they’re all mostly the same. I just needed the caffeine high and the smoking coffee smell in my office.

I decided to try this nanolot because I’m a sucker for the exact flavours this coffee claimed: mixed fruit jam (not the supermarket jelly), spiced rum, caramelised apple, banana cream and cola. Never imagined them together though. 

I made my first round today with 10gm beans ground at 19 in the c2 (ChatGPT gave me that number), with 20gm to bloom, 80 gm at 40 seconds, and another 87 grams at 60 seconds. Haroon v60 bleached paper, and the hario red plastic dripper.

1pcwvyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_initialpure2024/comments/1pcwvyg/what_your_lingerie_choice_reveals_about_your/,What Your Lingerie Choice Reveals About Your Inner World,"We often think of lingerie as just fabric and lace—something hidden, functional, or occasionally decorative. But have you ever stopped to consider why you’re drawn to certain pieces? That favorite [bra](https://www.initialpure.com/collections/bra-sets), the go-to [panties](https://www.initialpure.com/collections/thongs-panties), [bodysuit](https://www.initialpure.com/collections/bodies-teddies), or [chemise](https://www.initialpure.com/collections/babydolls-chemises), the special set you save for days when you need a boost… they might be telling a story about you.

What we wear closest to our skin is deeply personal. It’s less about fashion trends and more about how we want to feel from the inside out. Your lingerie drawer isn't just a collection; it’s a curated space that reflects your mood, your confidence, and even your outlook on life. Let’s explore what your preferred style might say—with a light heart and a curious mind.

**The Romantic: Lace Details**  
If your collection is filled with delicate lace, you likely cherish beauty in the everyday. You’re drawn to romance, subtlety, and timeless elegance. Lace lovers often have an artistic eye and appreciate life’s finer details—a morning coffee in a favorite cup, fresh flowers, soft lighting. You believe in keeping a sense of magic alive, even in simple moments. Wearing lace isn’t about being seen; it’s about feeling beautifully, intrinsically *you*.

**The Effortless Optimist: Soft Mesh & Bralettes**  
You prioritize comfort, ease, and authenticity. If seamless mesh or relaxed bralettes are your staples, you’re likely someone with a positive, straightforward approach to life. You don’t do unnecessary complications. People probably describe you as genuine, approachable, and wonderfully low-maintenance. Your style says, “I’m comfortable in my own skin,” and that natural confidence puts others at ease. For you, feeling good is the best kind of pretty.

**The Confident Flame: Bold Red**  
Red lingerie is a statement. Choosing it regularly means you’re not afraid to own your energy. You’re passionate, dynamic, and you know your worth. There’s a fearlessness in how you move through the world—whether tackling a challenge or pursuing what you desire. Red speaks of vitality and intention. When you wear it, you’re channeling a powerful, magnetic version of yourself that commands attention, even if you’re the only one who knows it’s there.

**The Active Realist: Stretchy Knits & Sports Luxe**  
If you lean toward knitted fabrics, supportive yet soft styles, or lingerie that moves with you, you’re likely always on the go. You value practicality without sacrificing style. Your days are probably full—work, workouts, social plans—and you need things that keep up. This choice reflects a down-to-earth, energetic personality. You’re someone who gets things done, and your inner drive is one of your most attractive qualities.

**The Refined Dreamer: Silky Satin**  
Satin is for those who believe everyday life deserves a touch of luxury. If you’re drawn to its smooth, shimmering feel, you likely have a sensitive, aesthetic soul. You find joy in creating beautiful moments—a cozy evening in, listening to music, indulging in small rituals. Satin suggests a gentle, graceful nature and an appreciation for quiet sophistication. It’s your personal reminder that you deserve softness and shine, just because.

**The Timeless Classic: Essential Black**  
A wardrobe filled with black lingerie speaks of elegant confidence. You don’t follow fleeting trends; you invest in what makes you feel powerful and poised. Black is sleek, versatile, and subtly sensual. It says you’re self-assured, independent, and a little mysterious. You don’t need to shout to be heard—your presence does that for you. This choice reflects someone who understands the enduring power of simplicity.

So, next time you open your drawer, take a second look. Does what you see align with who you are—or who you’re becoming? Sometimes, the smallest choices we make for ourselves tell the biggest stories. After all, true style begins with what no one sees but you.

My wife (49F) and I (49M) have been in couples therapy for about a year. We’ve had ups and downs, including a short period where our sex life came back and then disappeared again. Over time I’ve found her bitterness and constant criticism to be a major turn-off, to the point that I’m no longer attracted to her.



We went camping a couple of months ago. I always wake up with first light, make coffee, wash the dishes from the night before. The first morning, I brought her a bacon and egg sandwich in bed with a coffee. An hour later she asks if I want to go to the lake. I said I felt like a hike instead, and she got really mad. She hadn't brought hiking shoes, and why didn't I think to tell her I was bringing mine, and how upset she is we don't communicate. I told her that all I'd done is express a preference. Then she hit me with ""it's always your agenda. Everything has to be on your agenda."" I had a WTF moment. All I'd done is get up, wash dishes, make coffee and cook her breakfast. She literally said ""but you like cooking and cleaning, it's your thing"". I couldn't believe it. If the genders were reversed, that would be an incredibly misogynistic and toxic thing to say.



That moment made me realize how many small comments and behaviors from her had built up over the years things that feel dismissive, negative, or just exhausting. Some of it is so petty I hate that it bothers me, like how she chews gum, but it’s gotten to a point where I just don’t feel love for her anymore.



At our next therapy session, I told her I didn’t think the marriage was working and that divorce might be the best path. She asked me to keep trying, so I agreed to continue therapy but made it clear she shouldn’t build false hope. We now sleep in separate rooms. She’s tried initiating sex, but I feel guilty and shut down afterward, so I’ve set a firm boundary.



Fast-forward to today. She was very vulnerable and asked if I still loved her, and what I even liked about her when we first met. I didn’t want to give false reassurance, so I told her the truth: that I don’t love her now, that I see her as mean, hurting, vindictive, petulant and that if I met her today, I’d run a mile. I also added that cleaning isn’t “my thing,” and that comment from her still bothers me.

1pcwrlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmAmazon/comments/1pcwrlx/adult_coloring_books_for_quiet_nights_which_to/,Adult coloring books for quiet nights: which to pick?,"Looking for something relaxing to do on quiet nights? Adult coloring books might be exactly what you need. They're not just for kids anymore - these books are designed specifically for grown-ups who want to unwind without screens.

**Why Adult Coloring Books Work So Well**

When you sit down with colored pencils and a detailed page, something interesting happens. Your mind focuses on staying inside the lines and choosing colors. This simple activity helps push away worries about work, bills, or tomorrow's schedule. It's like meditation, but way more fun.

Coloring also keeps your hands busy. Instead of scrolling through your phone for the hundredth time, you're creating something. Many people find this helps them fall asleep easier too.

**What Makes a Good Coloring Book**

Not all coloring books are the same. Some have super tiny details that need sharp pencils and perfect lighting. Others have bigger spaces that work great when you're watching TV or listening to music.

Think about what sounds relaxing to you. Do you like flowers and nature scenes? Geometric patterns? Maybe animals or fantasy worlds? The subject matters less than picking something that makes you happy to look at.

Paper quality is important too. Thin pages mean markers will bleed through. Thicker paper lets you use whatever coloring tools you want without ruining the next page.

**Finding Your Perfect Match**

If you're new to this, start with books that have varied designs. That way you can try different styles without buying multiple books. Look for ones with perforated pages if you want to frame your favorites or give them as gifts.

You can check out a solid collection of options here: https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books. They've got different themes and difficulty levels all in one place.

**What You'll Actually Need**

The book is just the start. You'll want something to color with - colored pencils are the most popular because they're easy to control and don't bleed. Markers work too, but stick with fine-tip ones.

Good lighting helps a lot. Those tiny spaces are tough to see in dim light. Keep your supplies in one spot so everything's ready when you want a coloring session.

**Making It Part of Your Routine**

Set aside 20-30 minutes before bed. That's enough time to finish a section without staying up too late. Keep your coloring book on your nightstand or coffee table where you'll actually see it.

Some people color while listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Others prefer silence or calm music. There's no wrong way to do this - it's about what helps you relax.

**Where to Start Shopping**

Ready to give it a try? Browse through different styles and themes at https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books to find something that catches your eye. Most books are pretty affordable, so you can grab a couple different types without breaking the bank.

The best coloring book is the one you'll actually use. Pick designs that excite you, grab some pencils, and give yourself permission to just enjoy coloring again. Your quiet nights are about to get a whole lot more peaceful.",1,1764742842.0,UmmAmazon,0,1.0,False

**10 AM:** Spent 2 hours finding the best credit card for airport lounge access

* Compared 15 cards
* Read 47 reviews
* Built a spreadsheet
* Saved ₹3,000 annually

**2 PM:** Ordered lunch on Swiggy

* Saw ""₹150 off on ₹300"" offer
* Added ₹80 of food I didn't need to hit ₹300
* Spent ₹270 total (after discount)
* If I'd just eaten the ₹200 meal I wanted, I'd have saved ₹70

**6 PM:** Researched Amazon deals for 1 hour

* Found headphones for ₹2,400 (down from ₹3,200)
* Felt like a genius
* Saved ₹800!

**8 PM:** Too tired to cook

* Swiggy: ₹650
* Didn't even check for deals
* Just clicked ""Order""

**Net result for the day:**

* Saved: ₹800 (headphones) + ₹3,000/365 days = ₹808/day
* Wasted: ₹70 (fake Swiggy deal) + ₹400 (Swiggy vs cooking)
* **Actual savings: ₹338**

**But I spent 3+ hours ""optimizing.""**

That's ₹112/hour of ""savings."" I literally earn more than that at my job.

**The pattern I've noticed:**

**I'm OBSESSIVE about:**

* Credit card rewards (research for hours)
* Flight deal alerts (check daily)
* Cashback offers (never miss one)
* Amazon/Flipkart sales (set reminders)

**I'm CARELESS about:**

* Daily food delivery (just order)
* Impulse purchases (it's only ₹500)
* Subscriptions I don't use (₹3K/month gone)
* Uber vs Metro (₹200 difference, daily)

**The math is bonkers:**

My ""optimized"" big purchases save me: \~₹15K/year My ""careless"" small purchases cost me: \~₹60K/year

**Net: I'm LOSING ₹45K/year despite feeling like I'm ""good with money.""**

**Why do we do this?**

Is it because:

* Big purchases feel important (research is justified)
* Small purchases feel insignificant (₹200 doesn't matter)
* Deals feel like winning (dopamine hit)
* Routine spending is invisible (just life)

**Here's what I think the actual smart approach is:**

**DON'T optimize:**

* Big one-time purchases (they're rare, just buy what you need)
* Travel deals (time spent hunting < money saved)
* Credit card research (pick one good card, done)

**DO optimize:**

* Daily repeating expenses (food, transport, coffee)
* Subscriptions (audit monthly)
* Impulse purchases (48-hour rule)

**But this feels... backwards?**

Like, I ENJOY researching credit cards and finding travel deals. It's fun.

I DON'T enjoy tracking daily spending. It's boring.

But the boring thing would actually save me more money.

Stevie got out of the car and stretched her stiff limbs. It had been a long drive, and she was ready to sit down and relax for the rest of the day.

Unfortunately, the boxes in the boot of the car beckoned to be taken inside and unpacked. Letting out a sigh, Stevie grabbed her keys and unlocked the front door before starting to bring in all the boxes.

Stevie moved out here to be closer to her aunt, Anica. After losing both of her parents, Stevie didn’t feel like being in her hometown anymore. There was nothing left for her in that small town. Moving out here would give her a fresh start. At least, Stevie hoped so. Placing down the last box in the living room, she shut the door and plopped down onto the couch.

The slight hum of the AC in the background began to lull her to sleep. It had been a long drive after all, and who knows when she would get another nap like this again? Stevie closed her eyes, falling asleep. Knocking on her front door made her jolt awake as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She stood up and walked over to the door, peeking through the peephole.

Standing in the automatic porch light was her aunt Anica, with a small box in her hands.

Why was she here so late? Usually, she would call to let her know she was coming over. Yet here she was, standing on her porch in the middle of the night. A bizarre smile on her face, Stevie slowly opened the door.

“Aunt Anica, what brings you here this late?” she asked, looking at the woman in front of her. Anica’s smile faltered for a bit before spreading back onto her lips. “I just couldn’t wait to give you this welcome gift.” She patted the box, shoving it into Stevie’s hands.

Fumbling with the box, she looked at her aunt, who had taken a step back. “Well…uh, thank you, but you didn’t have to,” Stevie mumbled. Anica let out a soft chuckle, continuing to back away. “Oh no, dear…thank you for taking it off my hands.” She watched the woman hurriedly walk down the driveway and into her waiting car. Stevie stood there dumbfounded as she glanced down at the box in her hands.

Why had Aunt Anica been so adamant about giving her this **gift**?

Whatever it was, Stevie guessed her aunt was afraid that she would misplace it. Not that Anica was the type to lose anything, considering how well-organized she was. What exactly had been pawned off on her? Shutting the door, Stevie walked over to the couch, sat on the arm of it, and carefully opened the box. Inside was your typical porcelain doll, except for a marking on its cheek that appeared to be a beauty mark or a tiny crack.

Sighing, she played with the curls before setting the doll and its box aside on the couch. Stevie would find a place for the doll the next day. After all, she had a lot of unpacking to do anyway, so it would not hurt to wait to display the gift. Glancing at the doll, Stevie closed the lid to its box. There was just something about this doll that made her uneasy, but she could not let it phase her.

The following day, as Stevie goes to make coffee, she lets out a surprised gasp, seeing the doll on the counter. She knew she had not left the doll there. Maybe she was so tired that she was seeing things. Right? At least, that is what she wanted to believe, anyway.

Picking up the doll, Stevie took it to the living room and placed it on the bookshelf.

She goes back to the kitchen and makes her coffee. Added her milk, sipping the divine liquid of the gods, and sighed happily. From her spot leaning against the counter, Stevie studied the doll with curiosity. Stevie knew that she had never sleptwalked before, so surely, she could not have moved the doll. Anica, her aunt, could not have come in during the night since she did not have a key.

The doll itself could not have moved on its own…

It was not one of those that could. The doll was made of porcelain, and its limbs were unbendable.

So, how was it able to move on its own? Finishing her coffee, she headed to her bedroom, took a well-deserved shower, and got dressed to go for a jog. It was an opportunity to get a look at the neighborhood she lived in. Hopefully, this would also help clear her head. Dolls did not move on their own.

It was around lunchtime when Stevie walked back in through the door. Her eyes went to the bookshelf where the doll was supposed to be. She was missing. Where was she now? Looking around the living room from top to bottom and even under the couch, she could not find her. Stevie stepped into the kitchen, hands placed on her hips. Raising her head, she looked up at the top of the fridge.

Had she placed the doll there? But she could have sworn she placed her on the bookshelf. Or maybe Stevie had not and put her on the fridge instead. After all, she did come in here to make her coffee. So, absent-mindedly, Stevie had placed her up there instead.

Shaking her head, she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose with a thumb and index finger.

Stevie had never been forgetful before, but maybe the move was finally taking its toll on her.

Reaching up, she took the doll down from the fridge and placed it back on the bookshelf. Then, she began to unpack a few boxes. She put her book collection onto the shelf along with the doll, propping it up in place.

Stevie thought that if she put something around the doll and it moved on its own, she would be able to hear it. That was the plan anyway, and she hoped it would work. However, that night, when Stevie was sleeping, three loud thuds hitting the hardwood floor made her sit upright in bed, her heart thumping wildly, causing her ears to thrum.

The bed creaked as Stevie swung her legs over the edge and stood up, grabbing the baseball bat she kept by the bed. She slowly made her way out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Stevie squinted her eyes, peering into the living room. On the floor, her books were scattered around, with the doll nowhere to be seen. She perked up her ears and listened closely.

Stevie could hear the faint sound of something skittering around on the first floor. When something brushed past her legs and up the stairs, she screamed, losing her balance, and fell down the rest of the way, hitting her head at the bottom. Her vision went dark. When she woke up, Stevie had a sizable bump on her head and a swollen ankle. Had she been knocked out all night? She blearily looked around, squinting her eyes at the bright sunlight shining through the curtains.

Looking up at the stairs, she gasped, seeing the doll sitting there looking down at her. Stevie scooted backward, her back hitting the wall, wincing in pain at both her head and ankle. There was something up with this **doll** that her aunt Anica had given her. Pulling herself up, Stevie limped over to the doll, snatching it up, and carried it to a hall closet, where she placed it onto a top shelf, closing the door.

Stevie began her day by having a quick breakfast and tended to her injuries. As she sipped her coffee, she called a friend who was an expert in haunted and possessed objects. He may have answers to her questions. Picking up her phone, she called Eris, an expert in haunted objects. He had always warned her not to pick up anything old, or if it ever gave her a bad feeling.

She told him that her aunt, Anica, had given her this **doll** when she arrived in town. She seemed hesitant about accepting it. Eris said to her that without seeing it in person, there would be no one he would know for sure. She should still take precautions to protect herself. Stevie almost laughed at this until she remembered that the doll had tripped her, making her fall down the stairs.

Stevie could have died last night. She agreed and ended the call. Looking up from her phone, that doll was there sitting upright in the living room. Dropping her coffee cup, it shattered onto the hardwood floor. Stevie cursed as she moved around the mess to grab some paper towels to clean it up.

When she was done, Stevie placed the doll back into the closet, placing a chair under the knob.

To make sure the doll could not get out.

It wouldn’t be able to.

At the very least, it could help her sleep better tonight. Stevie went through the rest of her day. Trying to put the doll out of her mind and what happened last night.

Though her limping and throbbing head was an annoying reminder that it had happened, Stevie wished that she hadn’t accepted that doll from her aunt in the first place.

Later that night, she settled into bed. Her head had stopped hurting, but the throbbing in her ankle was still there. Stevie probably should have gone to the clinic near the house, but she was stubborn. Plus, she didn’t think that “*a doll tripped me last night”* would be a good reason to be seen. If it got worse, she would say she was moving furniture, as she had recently moved.

As Stevie drifted off to sleep, that was when the nightmares began. In this nightmare, she was being chased down a long corridor. Stevie was running and kept looking over her shoulder. Yet every time she tried to get a good look at what was behind her, the lights would go out. The figure would blend effortlessly into the darkness surrounding them, keeping its form a secret.

Stevie gasped awake, her heart hammering against her chest. As she shifted into a sitting position, she saw it. There, sitting on a footstool across from her, was the **doll**. Stevie slowly lay back down, pulling the covers up over her head. She squeezed her eyes tightly, pursing her lips together slowly as the lump in her throat. *“Please go away…”* she thought to herself.

In the morning, she found herself inside one of the many cafés that littered a downtown plaza, staring into her empty coffee cup. There were prominent dark circles under her eyes. Stevie honestly felt that her energy had been sapped from her. This had to do with the doll; there was no doubt about it. She needed to contact her aunt.

That woman had pawned the doll off on her, so she had to know something about it. There was no way Stevie was going to let Anica run away from this. She called her and set up a meeting location. When Anica saw her niece, she lowered her head in shame, the smile disappearing from her face. “I think you know what I’m here to talk to you about, Auntie.” Stevie gave a sideways smile, taking a seat across from her.

“M-my goodness Stevie…you look exhausted, are you no–“

“Cut the crap, Auntie…”

Ancia frowned and folded her hands in front of her. She began to tell her niece about where she found the doll. It was at an estate sale; the bank had bought an old house since it had gone unclaimed for years. A lot of the items they removed were still in good condition. When Anica’s eyes fell on that doll, she had to have it.

When she first brought it home, things were fine every day, but then they began to get misplaced, including the doll itself, which wasn’t always where Anica had left it. Then she began to have strange **accidents** happen in the house, like falling down the stairs, almost stepping on broken glass, and being electrocuted. Anica thought that she may have been hexed until the night she saw the doll scurry across the floor.

That was when she started losing sleep herself, and soon after, the nightmares. So, Anica packed up the doll and put it into the undercroft of the stairs. When she heard that Stevie was going to be moving into the same town, Anica knew what she had to do. Her aunt’s eyes teared up as she placed a hand on her niece’s hand, who pulled it away. “Who was running the estate sale where you got the doll?” Stevie cleared her throat, holding back a sob.

Anica dug through her purse and procured a card, placing it on the table. Stevie stood, took it, and went on her way. Her aunt Ancia had pawned the doll off on her to save her skin. That way, she wouldn’t have sleepless nights, nightmares, or accidents. Instead, she would rather it happen to someone else.

Even if it meant that it was someone close to her…

Stevie arrived at the address on the business card. An older man was setting out items for display at the estate sale for the day. Their eyes met, and he gave her a friendly smile and a wave. She took out her cell phone, showed him a picture of the doll, and asked if he had seen it before. His smile faltered into a frown. “Where did you get that doll?” he seemed uneasy, and he wiped his hands on his pants.

“My aunt bought it here,” Stevie motioned to the building.

The man shook his head. “It wasn’t supposed to be sold,”  he pointed at the picture.

“That **doll** is cursed…”

According to the owner of the estate sale, a medium was supposed to pick up the doll. He told his workers not to sell it, and somehow, it ended up on display with the rest of the dolls.

“If you have it…” he paused, clearing his throat.

“Give it to the medium and get yourself cleansed.”

She paled, putting her phone away, and wondered what kind of curse was inhabiting the doll, but that was a question she would have to ask the medium herself.

Stevie thanked him for the information and headed home to get the doll. She was glad to be getting rid of it. When she entered her home, however, the air felt stifling even with the AC on. The walls themselves creaked as she walked inside, seeming to pull in towards her.

“Where the hell are you…” Stevie whispered aloud to herself, looking around for the doll.

Her bedroom door creaked open from upstairs, and whispers flowed down into the living room. She knew it was trying to lure her up there and that her problem wouldn’t go away until she got this doll out of her house. Grabbing the baseball bat, Stevie left downstairs, heading upstairs a step at a time. Standing in the hallway, she had a full view of her bedroom. There, on the bed, sat the doll.

However, its appearance had changed…

Its clothing was darkened and stained with something that Stevie could only assume was old blood.

The once-pristine porcelain face was cracked, and from the cracks, a black, swirling mist spewed forth.

This thing was pure evil, and the bat she carried would not be enough to stop it.

Stevie leaned her bat against the wall and grabbed a pillowcase from the hall closet. Opening it up, she pulled it down over the doll, scooped it up, and closed the end. Going down the stairs with it, the doll thrashed about in the pillowcase in her hands. Just like her friend had told her, Stevie needed to get this doll to a medium. She was out the door and in her car with the doll in a tied-up pillow, sitting in the passenger seat.

Stevie found the medium closet and knocked on the door. The doll in her arms had gone still.

A woman opened the door, giving her a once-over before beckoning her inside. Stevie placed the doll where the medium told her to, and she began her work. The doll was sealed inside a special type of wooden box, and talismans were placed on the outside. When the medium approached Stevie again, it was to put her through a series of steps in a cleansing ritual. She was told to leave the doll in her care and that she would ensure it was disposed of.

Stevie’s mind was at ease, at least for now.

One night, Stevie came in from running an errand for a late-night snack. She was gathering up her bags to head inside. When she had spotted something on her front steps, it was a wooden box with talismans placed all over it. All the seams were filled in with black wax.

Now the box was open, the lid lying off to the side.

Stevie knew that the doll was free, and she knew that it was hiding.
