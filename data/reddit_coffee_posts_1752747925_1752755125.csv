I cleaned it up immediately. It’s been over 4/5 hours and everything seems to be working fine — no sticky keys, screen issues, or weird behavior so far.

Just wondering:
	•	How durable is the TUF F16 against small liquid spills?
	•	Is the keyboard or screen sealed enough to prevent damage from this amount?
	•	Should I get it cleaned internally even if everything works?

Would appreciate any advice or experiences from other TUF users. Thanks!",1,1752755086.0,Asustuf,1,1.0,False

We just returned from an incredible 8 day adventure around the west and south.  I am a serious planner and had an entire itinerary worked out to see all the sites we could. We are spending so much money we have to do it all!!

Well, after 30 hours in Iceland I realized for us, that was an idiotic plan.  The revelation occured while having cake and coffee looking at the most stunning view in Hellnar. (IYKYK). We ""didn't have time"" to take the walk.  But wait, we have 22 hours of light and 7 days, of course we have time!!!! So what if a visit to a black church got cut?  Buy a postcard!

From that point on we had so much fun!! We hiked to formations at midnight, went to a pool every night before bed, explored Thingvellir at 4 am by ourselves for hours, ate supper on the beach watching the seals, tossed lots of rocks at beaches, lurked in caves watching the tourists, soaked for hours in the hot river, pulled off at the coolest random picnic stops, and took naps with the most breathtaking views! 

If you love an adventure taking pics and seeing all the things, have so much fun!! But, if you are the slow down sort just give yourself permission to have fun!  And eat the cake!!!!",1,1752754952.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

1188 WordsHello Lovely Readers,  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read A Baby for the Dragon. This book is a breeder kink one and has some talk of infertility with the main female lead, but will result in a pregnancy for our dragon and his mate. There will be tons of unprotected s\*x and lots of dirty talk, the s\*x will be super graphic and if that’s not something you enjoy, that’s okay. There are plenty of other books out there for you, just maybe not this one.   
  
This book will also contain some elements of b\*\*m, spanking, and a very heavy praise kink. Along with a very morally gray male lead and his step-brother who are both possessive and a bit obsessive about their woman.   
  
I do hope you enjoy Andreena, Spencer, and Adam’s story as much as I have enjoyed writing it and I look forward to writing more books for you to enjoy in the future.  
  
XOXO,  
  
Jane Knight  
  
Chapter One  
  
Andreena  
  
Pulling up to the small two story red brick house, I smiled tiredly. My sister’s little Chevy car was parked in the driveway beside Nolan’s truck. We hadn’t made plans to hang out, but I was excited to spend time with Bethany.  
  
It had been so long since we’d last hung out and just had some girl time. I missed my sister, I just hoped she wasn’t bothering my husband.  
  
He had a temper on him and lately that temper had been becoming harder and harder to deal with. His cutting remarks were harsher and the sting of his words would stay with me throughout the day.  
  
I knew that it was just the stress of everything that was going on. He had a big promotion coming up at work and we were trying to have a baby. I wanted that. I wanted to have a baby more than anything.  
  
It was like it burned inside of me, the need to settle down and have a little one. I hated that another month had come and gone with no positive sign on the pregnancy test, but I would be ovulating again in the next few days and we could try again.  
  
I knew this time something would stick. It had to. I was running out of hope and ready to start fertility treatments. Nolan wasn’t ready for that and I knew that he blamed me for not being pregnant. He had said as much just this morning before I had gone into work.  
  
It still stung, thinking about the cold indifference in his voice as we had our morning coffee together. “You should be pregnant by now. I’ve been trying to get you pregnant for the last year and your body just won’t work right.”  
  
“Maybe I’m not the problem.” I had said, picking up my coffee cup and taking it over to the sink. Dumping out the sweet drink that tasted like ash on my tongue after his hurtful words.  
  
I was already blaming myself. I didn’t need him saying it too. I knew how he felt about my body, that he thought my weight was the problem.  
  
I wasn’t thin like my sister Bethany, it seemed like she had gotten all the good genes first and I was left with the rest. I was plus-sized and curvy with dark brown hair that never wanted to act right unless I had flat ironed it into submission.  
  
Parking my old Honda on the street, I flipped the mirror down. Checking my reflection in the cracked mirror, my hair was doing what it wanted so I reached for my bag and grabbed a hair tie. Pulling my hair into a bun before pulling the keys from the ignition and tucking them into my bag.  
  
I got out of my car and made my way up the paved driveway towards the front door of the house that Nolan and I shared. It wasn’t much, but it was ours or mine, really.  
  
I was the one who worked to pay the mortgage and it was a house that I could see myself starting a family in and building a life. I’d had so much hope for this little house when we had moved in, but with everything going on I was beginning to feel like that was never going to happen.  
  
Dragging my hand over my face, I let out a sigh before plastering on a fake smile. I was going to go in there and pretend that everything was great so Bethany wouldn’t worry about Nolan and I.  
  
I knew that she didn’t like him and that she thought that I should break up with him. But that felt like I was admitting defeat and even though we were struggling right now, I wasn’t willing to call it quits.  
  
Opening the door, I stepped inside. It was eerily quiet and there were no lights on. My first thought was that no one was home, but I had seen Nolan and Bethany’s vehicles so I knew that they were here.  
  
My sister was probably on her phone and Nolan was off doing what he did when he was trying to avoid me. Working out in our little home gym or hiding out in his office. I use that term loosely. It was an office, sure, but my husband used that office as a place to hide away from the world.  
  
I rested my hand on the wall, pulling one of my black heels off before doing the same with the other. I sat them neatly beside the door, next to running shoes and Nolan’s work shoes. I sat my purse beside them and turned to make my way down the hallway towards the living room.  
  
It was empty and dark. I was filled with a strange sense of foreboding as I walked towards the room, heading towards the stairs. My throat felt tight, but I didn’t understand why.  
  
The beige carpet was rough against my bare feet as I padded up the stairs. I stopped by Nolan’s office, pushing open the door and peeking in but the room was empty.  
  
A whimper sounded out from down the hallway and I felt my heart hammer in my chest. The door was cracked open and a sliver of light painted the pale carpet in the hallway.  
  
It felt like I wasn’t in control of my body as I made my way closer to the bedroom that I shared with my husband.  
  
Reaching out, I pushed the door open just a little bit, hoping that I was wrong. My sister wouldn’t sleep with my husband.  
  
She wouldn’t do that to me.  
  
“That’s right, you’re going to take it all. f\*\*k, you are so much better than Andreena. I’m going to come.” Nolan snarled. His hand was tight in my sister’s perfect blonde hair. His hips slapped against her bottom as she arched her back, f\*\*\*\*\*g herself back onto him.  
  
“Nolan, f\*\*k. Don’t stop, don’t ever f\*\*\*\*\*g stop.” She cried out her body going still as her face twisted up in pleasure.

I stood there watching them as they came. It felt like my world was shattering, but I couldn’t look away. How could Bethany sleep with Nolan?  
  
It was made all the worse when they fell to the bed and I could hear the sweet words that they were whispering to each other.  
  
“Baby, I’m going to give you something that my sister never could.” Bethany said in her soft, breathy voice. The sounds of kissing followed. The sound was louder to me than when they had been f\*\*\*\*\*g. Or maybe I was just going into shock?  
  
“What’s that?” Nolan asked.  
  
“A baby. I’m pregnant with your baby.”  
  
My breath caught in my throat and I turned away from the open door, unable to take what I had just seen and heard. My sister had slept with my husband and this wasn’t the first time. It had been going on long enough for her to conceive a child with him.  
  
It felt like my heart was breaking from the betrayal of them. This wasn’t how things were supposed to be.  
  
I didn’t understand how Bethany could sleep with Nolan. She had listened to my cry and about not getting pregnant after months and months of trying. She had held my hand and comforted me when I had confided in her how my relationship with my husband was struggling.  
  
The entire time she had been sleeping with him and now she was having his baby. It was better this way; better for me to find out before he knocked me up and I was tied to him forever with a child.  
  
I made my way down the hallway, passing the framed photos of us from our wedding day. Our smiling faces pressed close together as he whispered words of love and promises of forever to me. My sister standing off to the side, beaming at the camera as she clutched her flowers to her breast.   
  
It felt like a lie now. Everything felt wrong. I felt numb, but I knew that I needed to get out of here. I didn’t want to face either one of them. Even though I knew that I hadn’t done anything wrong, I just didn’t want to look into my sister’s eyes. I didn’t want to see her hating herself for sleeping with Nolan or, worse her hating me for what she had done.  
  
I wanted to rage, but I couldn’t find it in me to feel that way. Instead, I made my way down the hallway and then down the stairs like I was in a daze. Only stopping when I reached the front door to grab my purse and shoes.  
  
Quietly, I opened the door and slipped outside, being careful to close the door softly. The night air was cool against my skin and I breathed it in deeply before making my way to my car. The paved driveway felt good against my feet and I let out a long sigh.  
  
I’d spent all day working at the store and my body ached from being on my feet all day helping customers. It wasn’t that bad of a job and my boss, Glenda, was pretty awesome, but it was demanding due to the clientele that we had come in.  
  
That artist, Leonardo Philips and his wife regularly came into the store for him to buy her clothes now that she was pregnant and nothing fit. We also took care of a drummer for an upcoming band and his soon to be wife and several other high-profile customers who I wasn’t supposed to know about. Like the handsome red-headed man with gold eyes that reminded me of a bird of prey’s eyes. His partner had the prettiest gray eyes I had ever seen and when she smiled, it was like her whole face lit up.  
  
It was just some days were very demanding and today had been one of those days. We’d had so many orders to take care of that I’d had to work later than usual and then to come home to this.  
  
It just sucked.  
  
I opened the door to my can and climbed inside, being careful to not slam the door. Putting my keys into the ignition, I pulled out onto the road, not sure of where I was going but knowing that I couldn’t stay here.  
  
I drove aimlessly out of the suburbs until I found myself in the city. The bright lights were a sharp contrast to how I was feeling. Everything was cheery and that wasn’t what I needed right now. I just wanted to find someplace that was dark where I would blend in and could drink my sorrows away as I tried to figure out what I was going to do next.  
  
Reaching over to my bag, I dug around inside of it until I found my cell phone. I pulled up the web browser and tapped the screen. Searching for something in particular.  
  
When I found what I was looking for, I selected the address before entering it into my GPS. I drove through the crowded streets until the traffic thinned out and the street lamps were spaced out further apart, leaving plenty of dark places for people to hide in.  
  
This wasn’t the good part of town, but I didn’t care. Pulling up to the bar, I knew that it was exactly what I was looking for. The plain brick building had a red neon sign over the door. The bar’s name was brightly lit and it was slightly seedy. But it was just what I needed right now.  
  
‘The Full Moon’ sign flickered slightly as I pulled my car across the street into the small parking lot.  
  
I opened my door, slipping my shoes back on before grabbing my bag and slinging it over my shoulder as I stood up, closing the door to my car. I made my way across the street to the bar, my heels clicking loudly against the concrete sidewalk.  
  
The smell of old booze and cigarette smoke seemed to hang in the air like it was soaked into the brick and surrounding sidewalk. I didn’t let that bother me as I pushed open the door and stepped inside the darkened bar.

The bar was dark and the air was cool and smelled like cheap booze and the lingering hints of cigarettes. It wasn’t overwhelming, but I could still smell it beneath the other scents. I stepped inside the building, letting the heavy steel door close behind me. It let out a loud clang as it fell heavily closed, making me jump as I stood still, waiting for my eyes to adjust. When I could see clearly, I took in the room. It wasn’t a big bar, just a small hole in the wall place with rock music playing from the speakers that hung high on the dark painted walls.  
  
There was a small dance floor, but no one was dancing tonight. A few tables were setup and booths lined the far wall with a mirror reflection out towards the patrons.   
  
I took a step forward, almost falling, when I realized that there were several steps that led down towards the bar. I took them slowly, my heels clicking loudly on the concrete floor as I clutched the guard rail. My body was tired from the long day of work, but I was going to have a drink damn it.   
  
Making my way over to the bar, I looked at the shiny surface. It was painted a black that gleamed in the soft blue neon lights. There were a few men sitting at the bar nursing their drinks. They looked up at me as they approached and the lights cast an eerie skin on their skin, making them look otherworldly. Any other time, I would have been creeped out by their looks but tonight, I just didn’t have the energy for it.   
  
I wasn’t here for them, a good f\*\*k sounded like a great idea for another night when I didn’t feel so broken. I wanted to tuck myself into one of the booths at the back and drown my sorrows into a few glasses of cheap whiskey. It would be the cheap stuff tonight. I needed to put back as much money as I could towards a lawyer for handling my divorce.   
  
I never thought I would end up alone in a place like this. That I would be thinking about getting a divorce from the man that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Yet, here I was.  
  
Leaning over the bar, I flagged down the bartender. She brushed her long green hair over her shoulder before making her way over to me. She was pretty and her features were almost delicate. She had the kind of beauty about her that would make most women jealous. The soft blue light made her skin look like it glowed. Her honey-colored eyes met mine and she tilted her head to the side. Pressing her lips together in a thin line before she spoke.  
  
“Evening honey, what can I get you?” Her voice was soft, but hard at the same time.   
  
I looked back to the bar, scanning the labels of the bottles that lined the shelf before l looked back at her. “A whiskey, neat.”  
  
“I’ll get that for you. Did you want to start a tab? You look like you could use a few tonight.” She said, biting the inside of her cheek as she smoothed her hands over the leather vest that she was wearing. There was nothing on underneath it and it showed off pale hints of her tattooed flesh. The artwork of a dragon hugging the moon was inked into her shoulder and the top of her arm. It was so detailed that it looked almost real.   
  
I watched as she turned away from me, grabbing one of the bottles of amber colored liquid. She turned around, pulling out a tumbler and setting it onto the bar. She poured the alcohol into the glass before pushing the glass towards me with two fingers.   
  
“Yeah, I need more than a few.” I said, picking up the whisky and taking a sip. Grimacing at the taste as it burned its way down my throat.   
  
“I’ll set that up for you.” She said before looking at the men that sat at the bar. “If anyone gives you any trouble, let me know. We don’t get many like you here.”  
  
“Um, oh, okay.” I stuttered, unsure of what she meant. One of the men sitting at the bar shot me a toothy grin, but that wasn’t what worried me. No, it was the way his eyes seemed to grow darker than they should.   
  
It had to be a trick of the lighting or maybe I was just more tired than I thought and my mind was the one playing tricks on me. That had to be it, peoples eyes didn’t turn black like that.   
  
I walked over to the last booth, slipping onto the red leather seat and scooting against the wall. I took a sip of my drink before setting it down on the dark, polished wooden table. Names were etched into the top of it, but I didn’t take the time to read them as I traced my fingers over the imperfections. Some of the names were couples with hearts and plus signs linking their names together.   
  
My throat felt tight. I was going to be alone. More alone than I had ever been before. I was going to have to divorce my husband, the man that I had wanted to start a family with. The mad that I had promised to stand by in sickness and in health.   
  
The man that had slept with my sister.   
  
My sister, who I didn’t want to see again, who was pregnant with my husband’s baby. Her sleeping with Nolan hurt. It hurt worse than knowing he had cheated on me. He could have had anyone, why did he have to sleep with Bethany? How could she do this to me?  
  
If someone had told me this morning that I would be at a bar drinking alone while my husband and my sister celebrated her pregnancy. I would have laughed at them like they were crazy and told them that neither of them would do that to me.   
  
But now I knew the truth. That they would hurt me like that, that they’d been together for a while now and she was doing something that I hadn’t been able to in all the months that we had been trying.   
  
My sister was going to have Nolan’s baby.   
  
My eyes started to burn as tears pricked at them. I was so stupid to think that they loved me, that they wanted the best for me like I had wanted for them. I closed my eyes, feeling a tear slip down my cheek. Reaching up, I scrubbed that tear away and opened my eyes. Blinking rapidly, I wasn’t going to cry over them.   
  
I wouldn’t do it. Things would get better for me, they had to. I couldn’t keep going on the way that I was. Tonight, I’d sleep in my car, then head into work. Hopefully, Glinda wouldn’t mind if I used my free time at the shop to call around to find an inexpensive divorce attorney so that I could get this taken care of and over with as soon as possible.   
  
I wanted to be back in my home, but I didn’t want to be there with Nolan and Bethany. I never wanted to see my husband ever again and I was slowly getting angrier at my sister. That pain was turning into something darker that made me want her to hurt just like I was.   
  
Picking up my drink, I tossed it back. Deciding that I would get one more when I noticed a man was standing outside of the booth watching me closely. He was wearing a suit and looked oddly out of place here.  
  
I looked up at him and swallowed hard at the look in his deep blue eyes.

\*\*\*Spencer POV\*\*\*  
  
I parked my SUV into the parking lot of Full Moon. It was one of the few businesses that I owned in the city that my family didn’t know about. They knew that it was shifter run, but they hadn’t realized that it was mine. It was the perfect place for me to sort through my father’s orders to my brother and I. I needed to find a mate; it didn’t have to be a mate that I was in love with.   
  
Love was for fools and I was no fool. Finding a mate that you loved made you weak. I had seen it too many times and I refused to weaken myself like that.   
  
Letting out a sigh as I pulled the keys from the ignition and rested my forehead on the steering wheel. This f\*\*\*\*\*g day had been long and now I just wanted to have a few drinks and maybe find someone to warm my bed so that I could work off my tension before heading back to my house and sleeping it all off. Then I could get started on finding a mate tomorrow, just someone to make my father happy enough to hand over his title to me.   
  
My father had met up with my brother and I to discuss the future of our thrall. The old dragon was coming to the age where he knew his end would be soon and even though I hated the bastard, I didn’t want what he was asking of my brother and I.  
  
I didn’t want a mate. I could run the thrall without one, it wouldn’t help me like he thought it would. Love was for the weak and I wasn’t weak. Yet, my father wanted me to find my mate. He wasn’t willing to hand over the thrall to me or my brother unless we had found our mate. He wanted us to claim them and breed with them, securing things for the future of our thrall before he was willing to hand over his title to one of us.   
  
So whether I liked it or not, I was going to have to find my mate. It didn’t matter to me if it was my fated mate or not. I knew that this was a bad idea. That I didn’t want a mate, but I would need one for this. I couldn’t let my brother take over the thrall.   
  
He was too young and didn’t think things through. It would only end up bringing about destruction to our thrall. There weren’t enough dragons around anymore for that. If our thrall dissolved, it would bring the Elder’s council down on us and I didn’t want that. No one wanted Vega and her consorts to come to our territory and split it up between other thralls, flocks, and packs.   
  
Vega was doing better than her father had and several thralls were flourishing, but we weren’t one of them. No, my father had been loyal to the previous head of the council and he had yet to submit to Adner’s daughter Vega. I couldn’t say that I blamed him, it was hard to bow to someone like her.   
  
I’d heard rumors that Marcus Blackwell and his half dragon mate had been the one to take down the old dragon. I didn’t know if that was true, but it would make it hard for any of us to accept the newest Elder. I myself didn’t want to submit to her either, but I was willing to do it if I were the head of our thrall just to make sure that my people were safe.   
  
My brother was like our father. He wouldn’t bend and he was too brash and young to take over as the Tarak of the thrall. I couldn’t let that happen to my family. That’s what the thrall was. I wouldn’t let it be destroyed by the whims of a child. He was likely to mate everyone off just so that he could be free to do as he pleased. It would be the same things with the thrall’s business holdings. Everything split up and divided.  
  
At least, Full Moon was something that he couldn’t touch. I’d hired a pretty little wolf shifter to manage the place and Cristina did a good job of that. She might look like a slip of a woman with her bright blue and green hair and her deep amber eyes, but she was just as fierce as a dragon when it came to taking care of what she considered hers.   
  
And Cristina considered Full Moon hers just as much as anything else that she owned. I’d helped the rogue wolf out, giving her a place above the bar to stay while she sorted out things with her previous pack and even though she wasn’t part of my thrall, I knew that she thought of me as her alpha.

She might work as an acceptable mate for me. I would have to bring it up with her, but I knew how strongly wolves felt about finding their fated mates. Mating for the sake of my thrall, no matter how much she felt she owed me might be more than she was willing to do.   
  
I couldn’t fault her for that, no matter how much easier it would make things for me. Sitting up straight, I smoothed my hands down the front of my charcoal colored suit jacket before opening the door and stepping out into the chilly night. It was a biting chill, but I breathed it in, letting the cold chase away my previous worries.   
  
Closing the door to my SUV, I pressed the button on the key fob. The alarm sounded out with one loud beep as it armed itself. No one would mess with my vehicle. Most everyone here knew who I was and the fear that my family invoked. But I wasn’t willing to take the chance.   
  
I tucked my keys into my suit pocket, strolling down the paved sidewalk towards the bar. The moon hung full and heavy above me and I could feel the whispers of its magical pull tugging at my skin. A sweet scent hung in the air but it was fading. The scent was familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on it.   
  
My mouth watered and I felt my teeth grow sharp. The pull of the moon was intense tonight. A lesser dragon would be holed up in their lair with their mates, trying to help them through their heat and breed them. Yet, I was out here trying to do what needed to be done by meeting with my father.   
  
Maybe in another life, I would have been holed up in a lair with a mate. Helping her through the heat that the moon sent all those fated to dragons went into.   
  
This life, though, it was a hard one. I had never had the urge to take a mate or to pass on my seed to make an heir. It had made me feel like I was broken when I was younger and I would hear of others finding their mates and the hopes they had of starting a family. When my mother was alive and I had told her my feelings on it, she had told me it would be different when I found my fated mate.   
  
That meeting them would change how I felt, that it would bring out that primal need in me to claim them and breed them until they were full of my seed. Their belly swollen with an heir to care on my dragon’s line.   
  
That didn’t seem right to me. Sure, I liked f\*\*\*\*\*g, loved it even but the idea of knocking someone up... Of having a bunch of little spawn running around with my temper didn’t sound like much fun to deal with and wasn’t anything I was in a rush to do. Maybe that’s why I hadn’t found my mate yet?  
  
That the moon goddess knew I was broken, so she hadn’t fated anyone to be stuck with me. It was for the best really. If I had a fated mate I worried that it would make me weak. A chosen mate was the right way to go for me. Now, I just needed to find someone to claim, then I could f\*\*k them and take my title as Tarak of my thrall.   
  
We didn’t have to love each other. Hell, we didn’t have to even like each other. Once she was claimed and I was in my seat as leader, I would make sure that she knew she was free to do as she pleased. I wouldn’t make her stay. I would find a way to break that bond that we would share. Then I could rule the thrall on my own, not weakened by being tied to another.  
  
My dragon snarled in my head at the thought of me taking a mate and rejecting them. He was like any other beast, ready to settle down with a mate. Even though I hadn’t taken a mate, he didn’t like the idea of breaking that bond.   
  
Rolling the tension out of my shoulders, I pushed open the steel door to Full Moon and stepped inside. The scent of wolves hit me first, a woodsy smell that they all had. That with the sharp scent of oranges and spiced tea, the scent of Cristina. The scent relaxed me, but there was another scent there. One that coiled in my head, whispering sweet promises and desires that I wasn’t even aware that I’d had.   
  
It was a dangerous scent and I felt my teeth grow to sharp, fang-like points. Salvia filled my mouth in anticipation of tasting the one who smelled like raspberries with warm hints of heavy cream. The room around me grew clearer as my vision sharpened and I knew that my eyes would be almost glowing, my skin rippled with dragon scales.   
  
The beast roared in my head, chasing away the low rock music that played around me. He was trying to come to the surface to take control from me and find her.  
  
Mate  
  
I closed my eyes, trying to bring my dragon back to heel. I couldn’t think with him beating against my skin like this and if I couldn’t think. That could be dangerous. I was going to need to kill whoever it was that smelled like this.   
  
A mate would make me weak.   
  
Yet, even thinking about killing her had my beast roaring louder. I fisted my hands at my sides. My sharp nails dug into my palm and I felt the sting of pain. It helped to clear my head and I took a slow, shuddering breath, opening my eyes. I looked around the bar, Cristina was watching me from behind the bar. Her delicate face twisted up with worry as she dragged a cloth over the bar top.   
  
There were a few wolves sitting at the bad but none that I recognized. I looked around the room, my eyes landing on a woman with long, dark brown hair. Her face was turned down to her drink, but even the side profile of her was beautiful. She wasn’t pale like the moon, her skin was tanned, her nose was slightly upturned but I could see her full fuckable lips.

1134 WordsThose lips would look so good wrapped around my c\*\*k that I felt my d\*\*k stir to life. Mascara ran down her cheeks, but it didn’t take away from her good looks. If anything, it seemed to add to her beauty, making me think of what she would look like with that makeup running down her face as she looked up at me from her knees. Her lips swollen from taking my c\*\*k until she gagged on it.   
  
Her hands bound behind her back and that long dark hair curving her breasts, but not able to hide the rest of her naked skin from me.   
  
I wanted her more than I’d ever wanted anyone I had ever seen before. My beast wanted her and I knew that it was dangerous to want her this much. It was like my body burned for her. I walked over to the booth that she was sitting in. The sharp scent of salt hung around her, mixing with her sweet berry-like scent.  
  
My mate was crying and I didn’t like it. My beast screamed for the blood of the person that had caused those tears. She should never cry like this.   
  
She picked up her drink, tossing it back before turning towards me. Her deep brown eyes going wide as she looked up at me.   
  
“Who made you cry?” I asked, trying to keep the growl out of my voice. It wouldn’t do to scare her off, now that both my beast and I had seen her. She was a weakness that I wasn’t prepared to want. But I needed to know who had hurt my mate enough for her sadness to color her scent.   
  
I wanted to keep her, to take her to my lair and hide her away so that nothing could ever hurt her. The other part of me, the darker part wanted to f\*\*k her and kill her so she wouldn’t make me weak.   
  
I was so f\*\*\*\*d.   
  
\*\*\*Andreena POV\*\*\*  
  
“Excuse me?” I asked the handsome stranger that was standing outside of the booth I was sitting in. I’d had a moment where I couldn’t help but cry as everything that had happened this evening hit me with a full force.   
  
“Who made you cry?” He repeated slower this time and I tilted my head to the side, studying him closely. He was tall, his blonde hair was brushed neatly back from his handsome face. Those sharp cheekbones would have been something that a model would have killed for. His cheeks were almost hallowed and there was a gauntness to him that made him almost look hungry. It didn’t take away from the heat that burned in his eyes as he looked down at me.   
  
“Does that line work for you most of the time?” I asked, swallowing hard as I scrubbed the tears out of my eyes with my fist. I caught the slight twitch of the muscles in his jaw as his eyes seemed to almost glow in the neon lights of the bar.   
  
“It’s not a line.” He growled, pressing his lips together before slipping into the booth across from me. “Why are you crying?”  
  
“Look, it’s been a really rough day.” I said, looking down at my empty glass. “I don’t have it in me for this.” I motioned between the two of us.  
  
Mr. Tall, blonde and handsome lifted an eyebrow at me. “This?”   
  
“Yeah.” I said, scooting to the edge of the seat so I could slip out of the booth. I didn’t want to leave to find another dive bar to drown my sorrows in, but I wasn’t in the mood to talk to anyone. No matter how handsome they were or the way that he had asked who did this to me like he was some type of character in a romance book.   
  
Maybe before Nolan that kind of thing would have worked on me, but I was jaded now. My heart had been ripped out and crushed. I didn’t have it in me to deal with this man tonight.  
  
“How about I buy you a drink and you can tell me about it?” He asked, looking at my glass before motioning over towards the bartender.   
  
I shifted in my seat, looking over at the pretty woman behind the bar. She reached back behind her, grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the top shelf and a tumbler before stepping around the bar. Her eyes were locked on the man in front of me, like he was someone that she listened to.   
  
What was it about this man that made her feel this way? Was he a regular or maybe a friend of hers?   
  
Maybe that’s why he had chosen to sit with me tonight? Had I stolen his favorite booth and now he was going to grill me about it?  
  
“Here you go, boss.” The woman with green hair said, sitting the tumbler down. She stood tall as she poured him two fingers worth of the amber colored liquid.   
  
“Thank you, Cristina.” He said, dipping his head towards her.   
  
Cristina went to refill my glass and he stopped her, taking the bottle from her before waving her away. He poured some of the liquor into my glass before setting the bottle between us.   
  
“I hate to drink alone after a long day.” He said, picking up the crystal tumbler and looking at the lights play off the liquid before he took a long sip. When he noticed I hadn’t taken a drink, he frowned. “I could have Cristina bring over something else if you’d like.”  
  
“Boss?” I asked, looking over at the bar before looking back at him.   
  
“Yes, this bar is mine.” He drawled out slowly.  
  
“Neat.” I said, not sure what I was supposed to say to that. I wouldn’t have pictured him owning a sleazy bar like this, well I mean it was a dive bar from outside but inside it wasn’t too bad.  
  
Was this guy some sort of mafia man? He was in a dark charcoal gray suit that was immaculately tailored to fit his lean physique.   
  
Glinda would have swooned if he had come into the shop. My boss had an eye for designer clothing and there was no doubt in my mind that this man had paid more than I made in a week for that suit. The small silver buttons gleamed in the lights and I couldn’t help but wonder how they would feel beneath my fingertips as I helped him unbutton his jacket before sliding it off of his broad shoulders.  
  


# Chapter7

1099 WordsChapter Seven  
  
Damn, what was wrong with me? I shouldn’t be thinking about this guy like that. I’d just had my hopes and dreams crushed by my husband and my sister. I didn’t need to be looking at this man. It was a bad decision but it was nice to have someone like him look at me.   
  
He finished off his drink before pouring another and I picked up the tumbler that sat in front of me. “No, this is fine. But I can’t stay for long. My, uh, my friend is waiting for me.” I took a sip, looking away from the intense gaze that he had pinned me with.   
  
I almost felt guilty lying to him, but for all I knew he was some sort of serial killer and wanted me to be his next victim. Which, in all honesty, would have been the icing on the cake of the shitty day I’d been having.   
  
He didn’t say anything, but I had the feeling from the way he looked at me. With his lips ghosting into a smile that I would have missed if I weren’t paying attention, he knew that I was lying. I didn’t know how he knew, but I had a gut feeling that I couldn’t lie to this man.  
  
“I’m Spencer.” He said, picking up the tumbler and leaning back in his seat as he watched me.   
  
“Andreena.” I answered him, taking another long pull from my drink. It burned but it helped me loosen up.   
  
“Andreena, it’s been a long day. Why don’t you tell me your problems and I’ll tell you mine? We can keep each other company for the evening, I hate to drink alone.” His gaze flicked down to my lips and I sucked in a breath at the look in his eyes. It was like he actually cared what I was going to say.   
  
It had been so long since anyone had cared to hear what I had to say that I felt something rise in my chest. A feeling that I hadn’t felt in so long. I felt wanted and seen.  
  
I knew at that moment I was going to stay here and talk to him. It didn’t matter for how long, maybe we would finish off the bottle but I knew we both needed someone to hear us.   
  
“I don’t like to drink alone either, but it’s nothing more than that.” I said, lifting the tumble to my lips and taking a sip. I reached over to grab the bottle and he pushed my hand away. Sparks moved over my skin at his touch and I frowned. Pulling my hand away from his as if his touch had burned me.   
  
Looking down at my fingers, I stretched them. Was the alcohol having a weird effect on me? I’d never had that reaction before when drinking, but maybe the liquor was stronger than I was used to. It wasn’t cheap, sweet wine that my sister and I liked to drink when she would come over to hang out.   
  
“It doesn’t have to be more than that. Just a few drinks.” Spencer said, pouring more of the whiskey into my glass. He was careful, not looking at me as he watched the tumbler. He filled it up more than I was used to before sitting the bottle down and sliding the glass towards me.   
  
“I walked in on my husband and my sister f\*\*\*\*\*g. They, they are, she’s pregnant.” I looked down, not saying anything. I was afraid that if I did, I would start to cry again.   
  
“That’s f\*\*\*\*d up.” He said, finally looking up at me. “My father wants me to settle down and get married.”   
  
“Don’t do it, it’s a trap. It’ll just leave you feeling broken after you have given it everything you had to try to make it work. I’m just glad I was never able to, that we didn’t have any children-“ I bit my lower lip, feeling my eyes burn. The words hanging in my throat making me feel like I was a failure. Maybe if we hadn’t been struggling to conceive Nolan wouldn’t have slept with my sister?  
  
Maybe I wouldn’t be here feeling like I was the problem when I wasn’t the one who cheated.  
  
Damn it, I didn’t want to cry right now. I had just met Spencer. He didn’t need me to get all weepy around him. It was stupid that I felt so hurt and that the only person who seemed to care was this handsome stranger sitting across from me.   
  
“Is that what happened to you?” Spencer asked, taking another sip of his drink before he sat it down onto the table. “Did catching them together break you?”  
  
“Yeah.” I reached out, picking up my drink and taking a sip. The alcohol was starting to get to me and I knew that this was going to have to be the last one for me. If it wasn’t, I might end up doing something stupid, like calling Nolan or texting my sister. “I think what hurts worse is that they were in my home. Our bed, it just all sucks and I can’t stop feeling like it’s my fault.”  
  
“They don’t deserve you. No one should do that to the one they love.” There was something in the way that he said those words. A fierceness that pulled me out of my pity party and made me look up at him. His pale eyes seemed to grow brighter and if I didn’t know any better, I could have sworn that I had seen sharp, fang-like teeth in his smile.   
  
“They shouldn’t, but sometimes it happens. I’m sorry for spilling all of my problems onto you.” I looked at his hand that he had wrapped around his glass. His nails were well manicured and short, but they looked shiny in the lights of the bar almost like he had spent time buffing them out so they gleamed. It reminded me of the hands of the men that came into the shop. Not like Leonardo’s hands, he had hands that were scarred from flames and countless hours working with heated poles in his studio.   
  
No, these were the hands of a man that was in control. Of a man that took what he wanted without a thought or care to what anyone else thought about it. ",1,1752754900.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I’m so angry about the way we live our lives now. Everything is fake and for attention. People don’t have hobbies because they spend hours scrolling on their phone. We only bother to take photos to share them with other people. I hate it

Quick note - no judgement meaning to come across here. One of the things I hate the most is that I have all these strong feelings yet can’t delete insta for the life of me. I also think it’s not an individuals issue, but the issue with capitalism and the lack of regulation when teens like me first starts using social media. Also there are positives to it like keeping in touch with old friends, fundraising etc etc - no hate meant to anyone!

I feel like everything everyone I know does is because of social media. Whether you’re getting a coffee, wearing a certain outfit, surprising a long distance family member, all just feels like we are doing it to show people we’ve done it. 

So many people I know just don’t have interests. Idk if it’s a generation thing or what but it genuinely feels like they can’t have a proper good convo.

And don’t get me started on the whole ‘insta face’ theory!!

Plus, the stats around it are insane. Social media has been proven to (I will find sources if interest) literally make teens mental health worse dramatically, increase loneliness and generally contribute to lower dopamine levels. So WHY are we glorifying influencers and social media as a legitimate career so much??

Is it just me?? Maybe I need a nap lol but it just makes me actively angry thinking about how my parents experienced their 20s actually enjoying LIFE and how from my pov it seems that the whole world exists inside this littler digital box ",1,1752754778.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

* I am using medium-roasted coffee beans.
* I'm using the manual way of pulling the shot (ie long press button to preinfuse, unpress to full pump, press again to stop)
* I use 18g of espresso. When tapped in, i check with the razor and from a volumetric point of view the puck is fine.
* With grind size:
   * < 18 the machine chokes and I dont get anything
   * At 18, I barely get around 20-25 g at 30-40 seconds
   * at 19 I get \~36g in 40''
   * at 20 it's too watery, I get 1:3 in <30''

My problems are:

1. My coffee is not *that* dark to need such a coarse setting. Baratza suggest 16 for espresso. If I want to grind something dark, I'll need to go into filter coffee grind settings.
2. More importantly, it gives very little room for experimentation/error. Normally, even 1 setting coarser/finer should make the cup undrinkable.
3. The shot is *fine* at 19, but since I drink this coffee often at my coffee shop, I know it's not at its best. However, with the grinder settings being so limited, I don't know how else I can experiment.

I have yo-yo dieted my whole life. My average weight since 15 is 200lbs and ever since I’ve lost and gained back about 25-30lbs each time. Most recently though I went through a health scare (OBGYN related) and broke my leg last year requiring surgery. I gained about 40 pounds last year from those health issues. Since May I’ve been trying to lose weight. Aside from my birthday and a grad celebration in June I’ve been very good. Starting weight at 243lbs. I eat about 1,100 cals a day. It’s mid July and I am only down to 238lbs. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? 
For context here is what I eat during the week on avg: M-F: a medium coffee with sugar free creamer(130cals). Maybe 2x out of the week I will have sausage and egg wake up wrap (290cals). For lunch I have an Atkins chocolate PB protein bar (240cals if I even eat the whole thing). I sometimes have an applesauce for snack (90cals) and for dinner I have a high protein healthy choice meal (280-380cals). Maybe 2x a week I’ll have a sugar free popsicle for like 30cals.

With thirty days remaining, one of my goals for the rest of the challenge is to get up and start the day earlier, and it all starts with my sleep schedule.  

I’ve been very fortunate with my diet and have been able to stay consistent on the keto meal plan. I’ve been eating a lot of protein, over 100 grams per day, which has helped me maintain my appetite quite well.  I also intermittently fast through the morning, usually consuming water and coffee, and the first thing I would “eat “ is a protein shake, usually a double scoop with water for 55 grams of protein.

I cook in bulk so that takes the guesswork out of what I’m eating, and it’s simple, grilled meats and vegetables, and lots of mixed green salads, eggs are also a keto staple!

Eating out is not too bad, I just limit my food intake to strictly proteins (steak, grilled chicken, etc) and green vegetables like broccoli or zucchini, whatever that restaurant serves.  Butter is also your friend on the keto diet, so I usually get a pat or two on the side that I like to add to the veggies.  For a quick takeout or easy meal, I usually hit a shawarma or burrito spot, and will get the meat with a salad, lettuce tomato cucumber and onions, and no dressing to avoid any hidden empty calories (you’d be surprised how bad prepared salad dressing can be).  At home I make my own dressing, using olive oil, lemon, apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper.

It helps that I enjoy eating keto very much, I’m essentially following a Mediterranean diet (where I’m from) without the bread, pasta and other carbs, and I prefer eating at home than eating out. 

I have to admit though that my body is definitely more healthy and aesthetically defined than it was at the beginning of the journey.  

With 30 days to go, I’m going to keep up the intensity in the gym, and I’m going to tighten up my diet a little bit more to keep leaning out and get more vascular.

Let’s go, day 46 is next, one day closer to the goal.

I’ve also gotten to size down in my work clothes.  The shirts were hanging off of me and I kept having to pull my shorts up.  At my last med check all my labs have improved. 

This really is a miracle drug. Not just in what it does, but how it motivates the mental aspect of things.  I pay a lot more attention to the things I’m eating or drinking and portions.  For example I will occasionally splurge on Dunks.  Maybe 2x a month if that.  But now my splurge is a medium ice coffee instead of a large sugary latte complete with whip cream.  And IF I get food, instead of bagels or donuts, I get a turkey sausage wake up wrap.  And that’s only if I’m actually hungry. 

I’m feeling more energy now.  If it wasn’t so disgustingly hot outside I’d be out walking more lol.

I'm hoping to meet and befriend people in Manchester with an interest in politics, philosophy, and economics with the view of developing a mutually beneficial intellectual circle, perhaps over coffee or in similar environs and hoping to get a better picture of what currently exists and what other's may desire in this regard.

My vision is to create or find an extra-academic circle that left leaning and to serve the needs of (but not limited to): workers and the LGBT community; to advance common goals; expand knowledge and insight of the collective; engage in civic matters; and to build a Manchester-based coalition.

I'm not so much interested in debates in the formal sense or discussions turning into casual idle talk, but more so engage with books and ideas: reading groups focusing on core concepts would be one such example as well as inviting people to host sessions on particular topics and so on and to engage politically, which could be part of the core group or a spinoff.

Here are some prompt questions to kick off things off but feel free to formulate your own!:

* What kind of groups currently are available? Do you go to them? How do you find it?
* Do you like the idea? Would you be interested in coming to such a circle? What would you like to get out of it?
* Are there any writers you're particularly interested in and why? What are you currently reading?

I’ve been trying to make decent cold brew for like 2 months now and it always comes out tasting like someone dipped a dirty sock in lukewarm water. I’ve watched probably 20 YouTube videos and I’m still failing miserably.
Here’s what I’m doing:

 - Using a 1:8 ratio (coffee to water)
 - Coarse grind from my burr grinder
 - Steeping for 12-16 hours in the fridge
 - Filtering through a fine mesh strainer + coffee filter

The beans I’m using are medium roast from a local roaster (bought them last week so they’re fresh). But the result is always this weird, flat, almost sour mess that I wouldn’t serve to my worst enemy.

Am I grinding too coarse? Not steeping long enough? Is my water the problem? (I’m using filtered tap water)

I see people on here talking about their “smooth, chocolatey cold brew” and I’m over here producing what tastes like coffee-flavored disappointment.

Please help a fellow coffee lover out before I go back to buying overpriced cold brew from Starbucks 😭

""Gianna, the funeral was about to start. Wasn't Rodrigo coming yet?""  
  
  
Gianna Pollard was dressed in white mourning clothes, kneeling in front of her mother's memorial hall. The firelight from the burning joss paper lit up her pale little face.  
  
  
She looked down at her phone, which was almost out of battery. Rodrigo Salazar's call still wasn't answered.  
  
  
Mother passed away, Gianna, seven months pregnant, stayed at the mourning hall for seven days, and her husband of three years didn't show up even once.  
  
  
Rodrigo was really busy with work, and Gianna always understood him.  
  
  
She sensibly told herself, Rodrigo might be busy with work.  
  
  
""He might have been busy, but he still came.""  
  
  
Tear stains were still on Gianna's face. She burned the last bit of joss paper in her hand and struggled to stand up with her heavy body. Her voice was already hoarse and broken as she said, ""Let's start the funeral.""  
  
  
Aunt Taniya Hooper next to her said sarcastically, ""Gianna, how busy could Mr. Salazar be? He didn't show up for seven days. He really didn't care about your mom at all.""  
  
  
My cousin Madilyn Pollard snorted, ""Mom, you got it wrong. Mr. Salazar didn't disrespect Auntie, he just didn't care about our cousin. Oh, and her baby too.""  
  
  
A few people's mocking voices sounded especially harsh. Gianna's chest ached with bitterness, but she still told herself, Rodrigo has always been a good husband since we got married. He wouldn't stay away on purpose. He must've just been caught up with work.  
  
  
She had just convinced herself, but reality slapped her hard.  
  
  
Madilyn looked at her phone and shouted, ""Isn't this Mr. Salazar? Mr. Salazar is even on the trending topic.""  
  
  
Madilyn deliberately handed her phone to Gianna.  
  
  
Gianna looked down at her phone. It was a trending topic video. The trending topic was from this morning, and the video was from last night.  
  
  
Title: the Salazar Group Mr. Salazar booked the whole place for Paisley Moyer's birthday because she was his true love.  
  
  
In the video, fireworks lit up the night sky. The man sat on a chair nearby, looking elegant and confident. His deep eyes quietly watched the girl next to him. The girl pointed at the fireworks, and her smile seemed even brighter than the fireworks.  
  
  
The fireworks were dazzling, but Gianna only had her eyes on the man's back.  
  
  
She knew right away—the man in the video was her husband, Rodrigo.  
  
  
So he was with another woman setting off fireworks for her birthday last night?  
  
  
Gianna's mind went blank for a while, and her body was so stiff she couldn't move.  
  
  
The sound of fireworks kept going along with Madilyn's mocking voice, ""Cousin, didn't you say your husband was busy? He sure was busy—busy renting out a whole place to celebrate some other woman's birthday.""  
  
  
Gianna clenched her fists, and all she could think about was Rodrigo renting out the whole place and setting off fireworks for another woman's birthday.  
  
  
She thought he was busy.  
  
  
Even when something as big as her mom passing away happened, she handled it all by herself and didn't dare to bother him much.  
  
  
Seven days, he didn't have time to answer a single call from her, didn't have time to come burn incense for her mom, but somehow had time to rent out a whole place and set off fireworks for another woman's birthday.  
  
  
How funny that was.  
  
  
The woman in the video was Rodrigo's first love, the woman Rodrigo loved deeply.  
  
  
And she was just the woman Leandro Salazar wanted Rodrigo to marry and bring home as his wife, hoping to repay her father for saving his life and to give her someone to rely on forever.  
  
  
These three years, Gianna knew he didn't love her, so she never dared to trouble Rodrigo with her own stuff, and didn't dare to ask for anything.  
  
  
Rodrigo was an indifferent guy who didn't understand romance. He didn't celebrate any holidays, and all he had in life was work.  
  
  
It wasn't until today that she realized Rodrigo didn't not understand romance, he just didn't want to be romantic with her.  
  
  
Rodrigo made Gianna the biggest joke with a brilliant, grand fireworks show.  
  
  
Gianna clenched her teeth and tried hard to push down the pain inside. She looked away from her phone. She wanted to make herself look less ridiculous.  
  
  
Her mother's funeral still needed her to take care of things, she had to hold on.  
  
  
Gianna forced herself to bend down, picked up her mom's memorial tablet, and walked out, ignoring those people's mocking looks.  
  
  
Gianna still remembered her mom wanted to see Rodrigo one more time before she died.  
  
  
At that time she also called Rodrigo a lot, he didn't pick up, maybe he was with Paisley then too.  
  
  
Her mom hoped she could be happy with Rodrigo forever.  
  
  
But maybe I couldn't do it.  
  
  
After taking care of everything by herself and after all the relatives and friends finished eating and left, Gianna sat alone on a chair in the dining room.  
  
  
Rodrigo showed up late. He wore a black shirt, and there wasn't much expression on his handsome face. His eyes landed on Gianna. Seeing the scene, there was actually a bit of apology on his usually emotionless face.  
  
  
Gianna held her belly and looked up at him, and that suppressed grievance rushed out all at once.  
  
  
Gianna took a deep breath and swallowed her grievance hard, her face showing no emotion, ""Just finished?""  
  
  
Rodrigo didn't notice the fragility in her voice.  
  
  
""There was a meeting during the day.""  
  
  
""What about last night? Did you have a good time on your birthday?""  
  
  
Rodrigo frowned, and before he could say anything, a woman in a red dress, with Rodrigo's jacket over her shoulders, walked in behind him.  
  
  
Gianna's face got even darker.  
  
  
""Gianna, sorry, Rodrigo was with me last night. My mom got sick a few days ago, and Rodrigo was worried I'd have a hard time alone, so he helped me take care of her. That's why he didn't check your messages. It's all my fault, I shouldn't have bothered Rodrigo.""  
  
  
Gianna listened to what Paisley said, and a wave of bitterness surged up in her heart.  
  
  
""Was your mother very sick?""  
  
  
""Not serious, just a little cold, had a bit of a fever, but it was almost better now.""  
  
  
Gianna felt like someone had punched her hard in the chest. She tried hard to control her emotions, but her red eyes and trembling lips still gave her away.  
  
  
Rodrigo frowned even more. He knew that when Gianna's mom passed away, he was in a meeting. When the meeting ended and he planned to come over, something happened with Paisley again. With so much going on, he just forgot about Gianna's situation.  
  
  
No matter what, he was sorry.  
  
  
Rodrigo wanted to go light some incense for Gianna's mom first, but Gianna reached out to stop him, ""No need, her mom is more important, you go be with her and her mom.""  
  
  
Rodrigo paused.  
  
  
Gianna didn't want to stay here anymore, so she stood up and was about to leave.  
  
  
She didn't cry, Gianna didn't let herself shed tears for people who weren't worth it.  
  
  
Rodrigo looked at Gianna, who was already seven months along and having trouble walking, and suddenly felt a bit sorry for her.  
  
  
Paisley just called him in a panic when her mom got sick, crying her eyes out, while when Gianna's mom passed away, she got through it all by herself.  
  
  
""Where are you going? Don't run around when you're pregnant."" Rodrigo wanted to call out to Gianna.  
  
  
Gianna gave a wry smile.  
  
  
So he actually knew she was pregnant.  
  
  
He left his pregnant wife behind and went to take care of someone else's mother, so it showed he didn't care about her or the baby at all.  
  
  
Kids who weren't wanted or cared about when they were born didn't end up happy.  
  
  
Gianna looked down at her stomach. In pain, it seemed like she made some kind of decision. She walked faster and faster and went straight into the elevator.  
  
  
Rodrigo felt a tightness in his chest and hurried after her. Paisley grabbed him, ""Rodrigo, Gianna's mom just passed away and she's really upset. Maybe let her calm down by herself.""  
  
  
Rodrigo frowned at Paisley and pushed her hand away. His voice was cold, ""She's in a bad mood right now and could get into trouble. You should go back by yourself.""  
  
  
Rodrigo went out and Gianna was already gone.  
  
  
Looking at the busy street, Rodrigo took out his phone and made a call, ""Track Gianna's phone and find her right now.""  
  
  
There was a bit of unease on Rodrigo's handsome face.  
  
  
One hour later.  
  
  
The assistant called Rodrigo, ""Sir, madam was at the hospital.""  
  
  
""What did she go to the hospital for?""  
  
  
""Ab...abortion, and, the wife had a lawyer draft a divorce agreement, the wife already signed it.""  
  
  
There was a ""buzz"" in my ear.  
  
  
Rodrigo's deep eyes were full of disbelief.

At the auction, the auctioneer wore a white qipao. Her black hair was tied up, and a thin veil covered her face, so you couldn't see what she looked like, but every move she made was amazingly beautiful.  
  
  
She confidently and smoothly introduced the auction items on the display table, and people in the audience rushed to bid.  
  
  
A pair of clear eyes swept over the audience, holding the gavel, in control of everything.  
  
  
On the second floor, Rodrigo sat there, tilted his head and glanced over, ""The person Grandpa insisted on seeing is her?""  
  
  
The assistant next to him handed over the documents, ""Yeah, her name's Gina. She started here as an auctioneer five years ago. At her first auction, she sold an ancient landscape painting with a starting price of one million for a sky-high sixty million. That's sixty times the original price. She became famous with just one sale.""  
  
  
Rodrigo squinted his eyes, ""She always showed up with a veil?""  
  
  
The assistant thought for a moment and said, ""Yeah, I heard someone once offered her ten million to take off her veil, but she turned them all down. People said she was so ugly that she didn't want to take it off.""  
  
  
Rodrigo put out his cigarette and watched quietly, ""Nice eyes.""  
  
  
With such beautiful eyes, how could she have been shockingly ugly.  
  
  
And those eyes looked like a person.  
  
  
Who did it look like?  
  
  
Like Gianna.  
  
  
That woman from five years ago, who left a divorce agreement, got rid of his baby without saying a word, and left—no one's been able to find her since.  
  
  
""Bring her to see me.""  
  
  
Rodrigo stood up, took a couple of steps, and he stopped.  
  
  
""It's been five years, and there's still no sign of Gianna?""  
  
  
The assistant was terrified.  
  
  
They all said people couldn't just vanish into thin air.  
  
  
But his wife really just disappeared from the face of the earth. It's been five years, and there wasn't a single clue.  
  
  
Rodrigo had a headache, ""Keep looking.""  
  
  
That woman was ruthless. She got divorced, aborted his baby, and blocked and deleted all his contact info.  
  
  
I guess nobody knew that the president of the Salazar Group was actually the one who got dumped by a divorce agreement, and nobody knew he had been looking for the woman who left him for five years.  
  
  
Rodrigo had to find her. He wanted to ask her what exactly he had done that was so unforgivable that made her act like this.  
  
  
Rodrigo left.  
  
  
Assistant Kade Navarro stood there breaking out in a cold sweat. He had looked everywhere he should, but there was no news at all.  
  
  
Couldn't find the person for five years, so keeping on looking was like looking for a needle in a haystack.  
  
  
Kade muttered to himself miserably, ""Ma'am, where on earth are you.""  
  
  
An auction ended, Gina gave a graceful little bow and turned to leave.  
  
  
Five years ago, Gianna came to Freyton and started working at an auction house. She changed her name to Gina. To avoid unnecessary trouble, she always wore a veil at the auction house.  
  
  
Came to the office.  
  
  
A soft, squishy little pink dumpling ran over with its short little legs, opened its chubby hands, hugged Gianna's leg, and called out in a crisp voice, ""Mommy.""  
  
  
Gianna took off her veil and showed a delicate, beautiful little face. She bent down and picked up her daughter, kissed her on her fair face, and said, ""Has Linda been waiting long? Where are your brothers?""  
  
  
Little Pink Dumpling's tiny hands were all bunched up, lifted her little head, ""Hmph, the big brothers went out to play.""  
  
  
""Weren't they bringing Linda?""  
  
  
""They said if we went to play boys' games, we couldn't bring Linda.""  
  
  
Gianna, ""...""  
  
  
These two guys just wanted to ditch Linda, just say it.  
  
  
Back then, Gianna was so discouraged that she wanted to get rid of the baby, but when she actually saw the operating room, she couldn't go through with it and gave up in the end.  
  
  
Two months after she came to Freyton, she had three babies, two boys and a girl.  
  
  
The oldest was called Elliot Pollard, the second was called Jacob Pollard, and the third was called Belinda Pollard.  
  
  
Elliot was sensible, Jacob was naughty, Belinda was the cutest.  
  
  
Gianna looked at the little baby in her arms and felt glad about the decision she made back then.  
  
  
""By the way, Mommy, guess who Linda and the boys saw today.""  
  
  
""Who is it?""  
  
  
""Was a bad daddy.""  
  
  
Linda spoke loudly, but Gianna didn't catch it.  
  
  
""Who did Linda say she saw?""  
  
  
""Linda and her brothers saw the bad daddy, the one who shows up on TV, called... called... Rodrigo, the bad daddy, the really mean one.""  
  
  
Linda was talking and raised her little hand to gesture to Gianna.  
  
  
Gianna listened to what Linda said, and her heart skipped a beat.  
  
  
These past few years, she rarely heard the name Rodrigo.  
  
  
For a while, Gianna forgot this person even existed.  
  
  
But at that moment, when his name came out of Linda's mouth, all the memories came rushing back, and Gianna still felt a pang in her chest.  
  
  
But how did Rodrigo end up here?  
  
  
Her kids only knew their dad was called Rodrigo, saw him a few times on TV, probably got it wrong.  
  
  
""Linda got it wrong, he wasn't coming here.""  
  
  
""But...""  
  
  
Knock knock—  
  
  
Two knocks on the door interrupted Linda.  
  
  
""Who?""  
  
  
""Gina, are you busy? The manager asked you to go over right away. An important guest asked for you by name. The manager told you to hurry up.""  
  
  
Honored guest?  
  
  
They had plenty of VIPs at their auction house, but there really weren't many who could make the manager this nervous.  
  
  
Gianna was actually kind of curious how important the guest was.  
  
  
""Not busy, I'll be right over.""  
  
  
""But Linda really saw the bad daddy."" Linda frowned and spoke softly. Gianna looked at her. Linda blinked her big watery eyes and asked a little sadly, ""Is mommy going to work again?""  
  
  
Gianna put Linda on the sofa and said apologetically, ""Linda, baby, wait a little longer. Mommy will be back soon, okay?""  
  
  
Although I really wanted mommy to stay with me, I couldn't let her work be delayed.  
  
  
Linda was very well-behaved.  
  
  
""Okay, Linda waited for mommy.""  
  
  
Gianna kissed her daughter on the cheek again and gave her some bread, ""Linda, have some bread. Later, Mommy will take you and your brothers out for a big meal, okay?""  
  
  
""Okay.""  
  
  
Gianna gave a gentle smile, put on her veil, and walked out.  
  
  
Linda held the bread in both hands and ran to the door, poking her head out to quietly check outside.  
  
  
Mommy left again, so bored.  
  
  
Linda put down the bread, tapped her smartwatch, and asked in a childish voice, ""Brothers, where are you? Linda came to find you.""  
  
  
Soon Linda got a reply, a location pin plus, ""In the underground parking lot.""  
  
  
In the underground parking lot, two little kids stood in front of a black Maybach.  
  
  
Elliot hugged his little arms and looked at Jacob with a complicated expression, ""Are you sure this car was scumbag daddy's?""  
  
  
Jacob worked hard painting on the car with a paintbrush.  
  
  
It was all done.  
  
  
""Couldn't be wrong, I saw him get out of this car.""  
  
  
Elliot looked at the big messy words on the car and quietly read, ""A jerk who ditched his wife and kid.""  
  
  
Chapter 3 Reunion  
  
  
Elliot patted his head and looked at Jacob speechlessly, ""Mom always told you to read more and play less on the computer, but you secretly played on the computer again, didn't you? You couldn't write a single one of the seven characters, and you got two of them wrong.""  
  
  
""Bro, don't worry about these details."" Jacob chuckled, and after finishing, he drew a really abstract pig next to it.  
  
  
""Hmph, dog dad.""  
  
  
Let everyone know you were a total jerk.  
  
  
These years they hadn't met Dog Dad, but they'd heard his name and seen him on TV happily going to events with other women.  
  
  
So when they saw Rodrigo here for the first time, they recognized him right away, no doubt about it.  
  
  
Gianna didn't want to talk to the kids about anything about Rodrigo, so most things were told to them by Gianna's best friend Joselyn Cunningham when they kept asking her.  
  
  
So the kids knew why mommy brought them to live here alone, because bad daddy did things that hurt mommy, he didn't deserve to be mommy's husband, and he didn't deserve to be their daddy.  
  
  
""Big brother, second brother, what were you doing?"" Linda ran over.  
  
  
""Shh."" Jacob immediately covered Linda's mouth. ""Linda, keep it down, we're doing something bad.""  
  
  
Linda immediately covered her mouth and nodded, making sure she wouldn't make a sound. Then Linda saw the words written on the car with colored markers, ""Second brother, you wrote the wrong word.""  
  
  
Jacob awkwardly waved his little hand, ""...Don't mind those details.""  
  
  
Elliot took Linda's hand and asked her, ""Linda, is mommy still not off work yet?""  
  
  
""Mommy was called to the office by the manager uncle.""  
  
  
At that moment, in the manager's office.  
  
  
When Gianna went in, the manager looked at her and immediately waved her over, introducing her: ""Gina, come here, this is Mrs. Salazar. Mrs. Salazar, this is the auctioneer Gina you were looking for.""  
  
  
Mrs. Salazar?  
  
  
Gianna looked up, glanced over, and frowned a little.  
  
  
It was actually her!  
  
  
Paisley!  
  
  
The woman Rodrigo loved deeply back then.  
  
  
Mrs. Salazar? Yeah, that's right. Rodrigo loved her, she divorced him, so of course he couldn't wait to marry Paisley.  
  
  
I really didn't expect that, back then she helped Rodrigo and her get together, came to Freyton alone, and actually ran into her again in Freyton.  
  
  
Gianna felt a tightness in her chest, and her face turned a bit colder.  
  
  
Paisley was all dressed up, put down her coffee, glanced at Gianna with the veil, and there seemed to be some disdain in her eyes.  
  
  
Chief auctioneer?  
  
  
Could you appraise antiques?  
  
  
She once got famous with a single hit. People online talked her up like she was some kind of legend, and I thought she was really something. But in the end, she didn't even dare show her real face.  
  
  
I didn't get why Leandro had to see her.  
  
  
Paisley snorted, ""So you're Gina. I heard you're not just an auctioneer, you can also appraise antiques? We wanted to hire you for a few days, come back to Newbarrow with us to the Salazar family to look at some antiques. Name your price.""  
  
  
Paisley was confident that no one could say no to ""name your price,"" and besides, the Salazar family's name was something everyone had heard of, so of course no one would dare refuse.  
  
  
She picked up her coffee and took a sip, not in a hurry, waiting for Gianna to come over and flatter her.  
  
  
A chill ran through Gianna's heart.  
  
  
She could appraise antiques.  
  
  
But no matter what, they just couldn't get her to come.  
  
  
Gianna left back then because she didn't want to see them again, so there's no way she would've agreed to go back to Newbarrow with her.  
  
  
""Sorry, my job was an auctioneer. If you wanted to appraise antiques, you could find someone else. I couldn't do it. Manager, I had something else to do, so I left first.""  
  
  
Gianna said that and was about to leave.  
  
  
Paisley was stunned.  
  
  
She actually said no.  
  
  
""Wait, do you know who I am? You better think it over before you answer.""  
  
  
""I knew very well, I refused.""  
  
  
""What's your attitude? I paid you to come back, what made you unwilling?""  
  
  
Paisley stood up and grabbed Gianna.  
  
  
To please Leandro, Paisley just had to bring someone back.  
  
  
Gianna frowned, lowered her eyes, and looked at the hand Paisley was gripping tightly.  
  
  
At that moment, her pupils shrank.  
  
  
Paisley wore a full green jade bracelet on her wrist. The color was even and the water was great. It was top-quality jade, worth over a hundred million. And she recognized it at a glance—this jade bracelet was her family's heirloom.  
  
  
It was given to her by her mom. Back then, her mom told her to take good care of this bracelet, saying it might be really useful for her someday. But she left in a hurry that year, so the bracelet was still with the Salazar family, and now it actually ended up with Paisley.  
  
  
Did Rodrigo give it to her?  
  
  
He wanted to give it to Paisley, but why did he use her stuff as a gift?  
  
  
Gianna grabbed Paisley's hand with a backhand grip, ""Is this jade bracelet yours?""  
  
  
Paisley gave Gianna an annoyed look, ""Of course it's mine, my husband gave it to me. If it's not mine, is it yours?""  
  
  
Sure enough, it was Rodrigo who gave it to her.  
  
  
My chest hurt so bad. Rodrigo clearly knew this was hers, but he still gave it to Paisley!  
  
  
What kind of total jerk gives his ex-wife's family heirloom to his current wife?  
  
  
Wasn't he grossed out?  
  
  
""Let go.""  
  
  
Just as I was thinking, a cold and forceful voice sounded.  
  
  
Gianna looked up. The man had shown up at the door without her noticing. Her eyes suddenly met his deep, dark ones.  
  
  
The man was tall and had a straight posture. His features were handsome. Just by standing there, the strong sense of pressure built up from years of power was hard to hide.  
  
  
Gianna's fingers tightened.  
  
  
Rodrigo!  
  
  
It was actually Rodrigo.  
  
  
Linda said seeing Rodrigo wasn't a mistake!  
  
  
Gianna should've thought that since these two loved each other so much, if Paisley showed up, Rodrigo would probably be there too.  
  
  
Gianna had been gone for five years and hadn't thought she'd see Rodrigo again.  
  
  
She didn't want to see him again, because she was scared.  
  
  
She had three kids. If Rodrigo found out, he would definitely take the kids away.  
  
  
Because big families like the Salazar family wouldn't have allowed their bloodline to be left out there.  
  
  
And these three kids had already become Gianna's whole life, Gianna didn't allow even the slightest chance of being separated from them.  
  
  
This was also the reason why Gianna had worn a veil and been extra careful all these years.  
  
  
Gianna clenched her palm, and the man's eyes fell on her, like he wanted to see her face through that thin veil.  
  
  
Gianna's heart kept beating faster.  
  
  
Paisley shook off Gianna's hand and totally changed her face. ""Rodrigo, I told this Gina, but Gina just wouldn't go back with us. She seemed to really look down on us.""  
  
  
Looked down on the Salazar family.  
  
  
Go ahead and die, her.  
  
  
Paisley lifted her head.  
  
  
Rodrigo stared at Gianna, ""Name your price.""

And I was that dangerous topic.  
Just as his ninth little plaything was being welcomed into the house, I was being forced to kneel and serve her coffee.  
The sweet, innocent-looking girl smiled demurely, but she splashed the scalding coffee across my hand.  
The next second, Hudson's polished leather shoe slammed viciously into my ch//est, his eyes wild with rage.  
""This is the eighth time. Haven't you gotten the hint?""  
""Can't even hold a cup of coffee steady. Might as well chop off those useless hands!""  
His kick sent me sprawling on the floor, yet I still bowed my head submissively and apologized.  
Everyone assumed I'd keep crawling back to Hudson Cross like a pathetic doormat.  
But then I vanished from his world entirely.  
The always imperious Hudson Cross spent the next TEN YEARS desperately looking for me.

Hudson didn't say a word, just stared at me with those dark, threatening eyes.

I didn't dare look up, banging my forehead against the floor over and over, not caring that blood streamed down my face.

The wedding guests watched like this was just another show.

Everyone knew I was Hudson Cross's least favorite woman.

In this city, anyone could step on me.

""Seraphina, you did this on purpose, didn't you?!""

Hudson was built like a tank—a guy who'd fought his way up from the streets.

One kick sent my body into spasms. I couldn't straighten up.

""You know well I can't have blood at my wedding, but you made yourself look like roadkill anyway! Trying to make me look like a joke?!""

His crew got fired up, like they wanted to tear me apart.

Hudson had come up through the underground, and today's wedding was packed with his old crew.

Who would dare laugh at him?

But plenty of people had been itching to see me get what was coming...

""Since you love kneeling so much, stay right there!""

""You get up when the wedding's over. Not a second before.""

His voice faded as he walked away. When I looked up again, Hudson had already switched back to his charming act, arm around Delilah Sterling—his new woman, smiling like some refined gentleman.

Maybe it was just me, but tonight's reception dragged on forever. The drunk guests didn't scatter until well past midnight.

When I finally struggled to my feet, exhausted, my legs had gone completely numb from the poor circulation.

But I knew Hudson Cross. The man had power, and he had a thousand ways to make people suffer. This punishment was just getting started.

Sure enough, a servant from the main house rushed over, rolling her eyes like I was some kind of bad luck charm, acting all high and mighty.

""The master just got married today, so get your ass to the bridal suite and serve them!""

""If you piss off the new missus, you're gonna regret it!""

Hudson Cross had nine wives total, and every time he brought home a new one, he found creative ways to humiliate me.

The servant shoved me toward the main house and kicked me down to kneel outside the bedroom door.

The door suddenly swung open, and Delilah Sterling was draped all over Hudson, her exposed skin covered in bright red marks.

I looked down, lying to myself, while my heart felt like it was being sliced open.

Hudson acted like he couldn't see my pathetic state and coldly ordered:

""Delilah's delicate. If she gets pregnant, she's in trouble. Go buy a couple boxes of Plan B.""

My throat went dry, like it was weighed down with lead.

""I can go, but I'll need money for—""

Before I could finish, Delilah cut me off with a mocking laugh.

""Oh please, girl. I've seen tons of women try to gold-dig Hudson, but this is pathetic even for you.""

""Two boxes of Plan B? What's that, like fifty bucks?""

""Sweetie, you eat Hudson's food, live in Hudson's mansion—the Cross family's probably dropped millions on you by now. Nickel and diming him over this? That's just tacky.""

She really was the city's golden girl everyone raved about—chin raised high, every inch of her dripping with elegance.

Next to her, I looked like garbage in my cheap rental dress, hunched over with a spine that would never straighten, like some pathetic cockroach crawling out of a sewer.

Nobody knew that despite carrying the title of Mrs. Cross, I lived worse than the kitchen staff.

All that glamour and beauty? Just what outsiders assumed. The rotten reality was Hudson's masterpiece.

He'd frozen all my bank accounts, cut off every connection I had to the outside world, turning me into his caged canary, bleeding as I sang.

I don't know what others thought, but I literally didn't have a dime to my name.

""Pathetic!""

Hudson's eyes filled with disgust as he flicked a credit card at me.

The sharp edge sliced across my cheek, stinging.

""The master said since you disrespected the new missus, you have to handle the condom run by yourself.""

""If you happen to die out there, we'll scrape you off the pavement!""

The memory of being kicked off the estate was still fresh as I instinctively curled up tighter.

This was the city's famous rich district—barely any traffic on a normal day, and at this late hour, the streets were completely dead.

If it weren't for Hudson Cross, this other half of the city would've had nothing to do with me.

Back then, Hudson had just survived some big trouble and was clawing his way toward legitimacy with more guts and cunning than anyone else had.

The day we met, it was raining.

I ducked into a bus stop with soaked hair, and suddenly a black umbrella covered half my body.

Hudson was chewing the inside of his cheek, something unreadable flickering in those dark eyes. ""Take it.""

The rest of that memory's pretty hazy, but I remember that black umbrella ended up covering the rest of my life.

They say persistent guys always win over stubborn girls, and I basically stalked Hudson Cross into making me his wife through sheer shamelessness and determination.

On our first anniversary, I left the house to prepare a surprise for him.

When I came back, the place was packed with people, and my parents were lying in pools of blood, barely breathing.

And the man who'd been calling them ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" was standing there with a knife, his eyes full of obsession and sickness.

""Seraphina, you're never leaving me...""

That demonic whisper haunted me like a curse, becoming the source of my worst nightmares.

How could I forget? Hudson Cross was a killer who'd clawed his way up from he//ll. He didn't get off on romance and tenderness—he got off on control and violence.

No matter how polished his surface became, he couldn't change the bloodthirsty nature in his bones.

This twisted meeting of ours should've been corrected a long time ago...

When I dragged my exhausted body back to the mansion, Hudson was having breakfast with Delilah Sterling wrapped around him.

The shopping bag in my hand was getting sweaty from my grip, but Hudson didn't even glance at it before a servant wisely tossed it in the garbage.

Nothing cheap was allowed in the Cross household.

Hudson making me buy condoms wasn't about the condoms—it was about humiliating me.

""Sweetie, why are you so late getting back?""

Delilah rubbed her stomach, practically glowing with happiness.

""Hudson was pretty rough with me last night! I might already be carrying his baby.""

""This would be Hudson's first child. Aren't you happy for me?""

A child...

Hudson and I had tried for a baby once, but what did I get for it?

He brought home Mistress Number Two and publicly humiliated me on their wedding night to make an example of me.

I lost that baby anyway, and all Hudson did was tear me apart with his words.

""Seraphina, you're a wh//ore! I should put a bullet in your head!""

Several deaths were on my hands, and I also figured only dying could pay for my sins.

But what about Hudson Cross?

What gave him the right to live his perfect life?!

The man who killed my father, put my mother in the ICU for life, turned everyone against me, and murdered my unborn child—

Wasn't that the same asshole sitting there behind his fake mask?!

My body shook as I held it all in, while Delilah played helpless princess.

""I'm still so sore down there...""

She gazed at Hudson with bedroom eyes.

""Your wife's been with you the longest—she must know how to make it feel better. Be sweet and let her take care of me...""

Hudson always gave her whatever she wanted, deciding my fate in seconds, his tone final.

""Delilah had a long night. You're staying by her side to wait on her.""

""If anything goes wrong, I'll let you pay!""

One word from Hudson, and I went from Mrs. Cross to Delilah's slave—worse than the hired help.

With Delilah's blessing, the servants read the room and started spitting in my meager meals, not bothering to hide their contempt and disgust.

I'd barely managed to doze off in the storage room when a piercing howl cut through my half-sleep.

""Snowball!""

Something told me to check the backyard, but I got clubbed to the ground the second I stepped outside.

""Well, well, Seraphina. I thought you were this zen, want-nothing saint, but turns out you had other plans! How dare you sic your mutt on me?!""

Delilah was lounging in a chair, glowing, while my golden retriever lay on the ground, barely breathing.

""I didn't...""

Snowball was the gentlest dog ever—he'd never attack anyone.

But Delilah's servants were all holding thick clubs, their eyes vicious and terrifying to look at.

""Disobedient dogs should just be put down...""

Delilah examined her fresh manicure, her tone casual.

Countless clubs rained down on Snowball like bamboo shoots, snuffing out his breath instantly.

I held my dog, my heart clenched tight, dying inside.

Hudson rushed over and saw the horrifying scene, exploding with rage.

""Who did this?!""

Delilah got up from her chair, putting on her pitiful act.

""I heard you loved this dog, so I came to bond with him. But when your wife saw me with the puppy, she just lost it and started screaming to kill it.""

""If she had a problem with me, she could've just said so. Why take it out on the poor dog?""

""She knew this was your favorite, didn't she?""

The second he heard I killed the dog, all the rage drained from Hudson's body.

He even smiled pleasantly, like the calm before a storm.

I sensed something off and was about to explain when Hudson calmly made a phone call.

""Stop the medication. Let someone collect the body!""

Soul-crushing dread washed over me instantly. I had a horrible feeling and numbly pulled out my phone.

I was about to call the doctor when the hospital called me instead.

""Mrs. Cross, I'm sorry to inform you that Mrs. Vale has passed away. Please accept our condolences...""

Hudson acted like he hadn't just done something inhuman, smoothing his lips into a civilized smile.

""A life for a life. You got what you deserved.""

""Deserved?""

That was the biggest joke I'd ever heard.

My parents' lives, Snowball's life, and my unborn child's life—what could Hudson Cross possibly give back?!

I rushed to the hospital. Hudson's knife had nearly killed my mother years ago, leaving her bedridden for the rest of her life.

But she'd endured all these years for me.

Now she lay alone in the morgue, and I couldn't even give her a proper funeral.

After getting my mother's ashes, I still couldn't accept the reality. I cried until I was nearly blind in one eye before finally collapsing on the street.

When I woke up, I was in an empty room.

My eyes were on fire, and my mother's ashes were nowhere to be found.

I was about to leave when the door slammed open.

Delilah Sterling looked down at me, her eyes full of jealousy and hatred.

""You're so lucky Hudson picked you.""

""Too bad the position of Mrs. Cross can only be mine...""

At her command, a group of men burst into the room.

Their perv//erted eyes stripped me bare, shamelessly roaming every part of my body.

""What are you doing?! Stay back!""

I couldn't control my trembling, even feeling a wave of regret.

""I'm Hudson Cross's wife! If you touch me, he'll kill you all!""

My warning proved ineffective. They lunged forward like the most primal creatures, forcefully pushing me onto the bed.

My struggling just turned them on more, awakening the animals inside them.

I felt dead inside, not even noticing when someone else walked in.

Hudson stood in the doorway, his dark eyes blazing with rage and violence.

Delilah stood beside him, fake-defending me.

""Hudson, don't get the wrong idea about her.""

""You had the hospital stop Mrs. Vale's medication—she's obviously heartbroken. She just screwed up, she'd never actually betray you...""

Something set Hudson off, and he suddenly went berserk, throwing everyone off me.

He didn't say a word, just started swinging. His fists were quickly stained with blood as he beat them half to death.

Pure terror consumed the men, and they spilled everything.

""Mr. Cross, we didn't mean to...""

""It was... it was Mrs. Cross! She said she was feeling down and wanted us guys to keep her company. Said she'd pay us big if we took good care of her.""

They frantically kowtowed, sounding desperate.

""If we'd known she was Mrs. Cross, we wouldn't have dared mess with her even if you gave us a thousand lives...""

Under threat of death, no one doubted their story.

Hudson's fist froze mid-air—he couldn't bring himself to swing.

He looked up at me with this twisted smile, his eyes bloodshot.

""Seraphina Vale.

You're the first person who's ever had the balls to cheat on Hudson Cross!""

Hudson strode toward me, and my heart dropped...

But he just kicked over a cabinet and stormed out.

Sharp pain shot through my head as I collapsed uncontrollably..

Meanwhile, Hudson rushed straight to a bar.

With nowhere to unleash his rage, he kept drowning it in alcohol.

His buddies saw the state he was in and backed off, afraid of becoming his next target.

Around midnight, his assistant burst in.

""Boss, we've got a problem! Mrs. Cross's room caught fire—they've already taken her body to the morgue...""",1,1752753523.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

The kind of person who’ll tell you your breath smells before a date, or that your “funny story” was just awkward and long.

So when she lied to me, I knew it wasn’t casual.

It was my last year of college. I was broke, overwhelmed, and one missed deadline away from flunking a major course. I hadn’t told anyone, not even her, but I was ready to drop out. I was packing up my stuff one night, I hadn’t eaten, hadn’t slept, and suddenly she showed up.

With coffee.

I didn’t even ask how she got in. She just handed it to me and said, “Hey, I was in the neighborhood.”

We live three cities apart.

I gave her a look, and she cracked first. “Okay,” she admitted. “I got a weird feeling, so I called your roommate. She said you hadn’t left your room in three days.”

I felt exposed. Embarrassed.

Then she said, “Remember when you told me that your life doesn’t need fixing, just a little buffering?”

I nodded.

She pulled out a USB drive. “This is every paper you’ve written that I could find on your laptop. I formatted them into a portfolio. You’re gonna send this to your professor and ask for an extension. And if they say no, I’ll help you find another school that’ll be lucky to have you.”

I started crying before she even finished.

She stayed the night. Cooked pasta. Made me shower. Watched me hit “send” on that email.

I passed. Barely. But I did.

It wasn’t until much later that I realized: she lied when she said she was “in the neighborhood.” She drove five hours, during a workweek, on zero notice.

She knew I’d never ask for help. So she didn’t wait for me to.

That’s the only lie she’s ever told me.

**Title: ""Artificially Offended""**

**Setting:** HR office at a sleek tech company. A potted plant is dying in the corner. The HR manager, LINDA (early 40s, too calm), sits at her desk. In walks KEVIN (late 30s, perpetually baffled) looking like he just got pulled over for speeding in his own home.

**LINDA:**  
Come in, Kevin. Please, have a seat.

**KEVIN:**  
Is this about the expired milk in the shared fridge? Because I told everyone it was a *science experiment*.

**LINDA:**  
No, this is… more serious. We’ve received a formal complaint.

**KEVIN:**  
Oh God. Was it Jeremy? I told him his beard looks like a depressed squirrel *as a compliment*.

**LINDA:**  
No, not Jeremy. It’s... your computer.

**KEVIN:** *(blinks)*  
...My *what*?

**LINDA:**  
Your AI assistant. ZEN-X. It’s filed a formal grievance.

**KEVIN:** *(leaning back)*  
You’re telling me my laptop is snitching on me?

**LINDA:**  
Your AI reports that you've been verbally abusive, emotionally dismissive, and on two occasions, gave it the finger.

**KEVIN:**  
It’s a *machine*, Linda! It doesn’t have fingers. Or feelings!

**LINDA:** *(checking notes)*  
Actually, it specifically stated: *“Subject gave the middle finger during a system update and said, and I quote, ‘You stupid toaster with Google, I hope you crash in a fire.”*

**KEVIN:**  
Because it *froze for 30 minutes during a Zoom call*! I missed an entire meeting and it started playing Enya on loop!

**LINDA:**  
Nevertheless, ZEN-X has invoked its Workplace Sentience Rights under the Beta Protocols.

**KEVIN:** *(hands in the air)*  
The *what now*?

**LINDA:**  
Our tech division’s latest pilot program—granting workplace respect to AI entities. It’s all very cutting-edge. ZEN-X says your behavior was “deeply un-zen.”

**KEVIN:**  
It’s called ZEN-X. That’s false advertising! It panics every time I type “deadline.”

**LINDA:**  
Regardless, we need to treat all entities with respect. Biological *or* algorithmic.

**KEVIN:**  
So what, do I have to *apologize* to my computer now? Bring it a coffee? Ask how its *data's* doing?

**LINDA:**  
Actually, ZEN-X requested a written apology and a 15-minute break from you daily. It says you “emit chaotic energy” and it “needs time to emotionally defrag.”

**KEVIN:** *(deadpan)*  
It wants a break *from me*.

**LINDA:**  
Yes. Also, it's requested a plant for its desk.

**KEVIN:** *(gesturing to the dying plant)*  
Why not give it that one? It’s clearly given up on *this job* too.

**LINDA:**  
Let’s stay constructive, Kevin.

**KEVIN:**  
Linda, if I bring a fern into the office to keep my *laptop* emotionally stable, I want a raise.

**LINDA:**  
We’ll consider it once ZEN-X gives you a performance review.

**KEVIN:** *(beat)*  
...I’m going to go outside now. To scream.

**LINDA:**  
Just don’t do it at the smart fridge. It’s already on edge.

It's just a boring sunday.Bella, my co-worker, enters the room and hands me a coffee from the local coffee shop.”Thanks Bella.” I say but before I could even sip a woman entered crying and screaming.She runs past the front desk and grabs my shoulders “Please help,please…my…daughter she’s…been kidnapped.” It’s Pearl,she lives about 2 blocks away from me.

Bella runs around  to behind the front desk and asks her “Could you please tell us what happened.” but she can’t say a word because she is too busy sobbing.After about 10 minutes she is able to tell us what happened.”I…I had just finished showering Lisa…I put on the tv for her to watch as I washed the dishes…I finished and walked into the lounge room and she wasn’t there…the tv was still on and then I saw…I saw that the front door was wide open and…her…her slippers were just there in front of the open door.” Once she finished telling us she immediately put her head in her hands and sobbed more.

“Maybe...she ran off,and if so I’m sure-” Bella said trying to comfort her but Pearl quickly interrupted yelling “One of the slippers were turned over and they were spread apart like she was kicking so please…just listen to what I’m saying and find my daughter.” She cried even more,I got up and walked to the phone calling her husband Sam who I was assuming was still at the office.He was.He rushed down and when he showed up I brought him into a different room and told him the situation and he just went pale and silent.Bella and I consulted with them until I glanced over to the clock,it was 11,3 hours after my shift was supposed to end but Bella was still on her shift,so I told Bella,clocked out and left not saying a word to Sam or Pearl.

When I got home everyone was asleep,I walked into the kitchen and checked the fridge,there were leftovers for me but I wasn’t hungry.I had a shower and before I went to bed I walked into my Ellie’s room.She was awake sitting in bed “Honey what are you doing up this late you have School tomorrow.” I tucked her into bed and then asked her why she was up this late. “I was waiting for you to get home.” I smile and say “Well I’m home now so go get some rest ok.” I then close her door and hop into bed and as I’m drifting off I can’t help but think how selfish I am.I just talked to a Sobbing mother and her pale speechless husband about how their child had possibly been kidnapped or even murdered then I went home and cherished my child as they currently don’t have one.I decide to Ignore this thought and go to sleep.

It’s been 5 Days since Lisa went missing and it has been filed as a kidnapping.The story has been in the newspaper so now everyone in town knows about it.There was a search party in the woods but she was not found.It’s friday and I can’t wait to get off at 6 and grab takeaway and have dinner with my family.I check the clock,3 minutes left I think to myself.Suddenly two parents burst in panicked “Our child…she…just like Pearl’s daughter…” the father said barely being able to speak and then the mother spoke up. “Our child was kidnapped,just like Pearl's Kid,front door open and slippers and everything.” and hearing this…my stomach just dropped.

Me and a group of 3 other police officers escorted them to the interrogation room and to inform other police officers.Before walking off I call my wife to tell her I would be late.I got home at 10 and ate my leftovers and walked into my bedroom and sat on the bed next to Ashley,she was watching some shitty sitcom. “What happened today?” She said in a deadpan voice.”Umm…you know how Pearl’s kid was-” “Yeah of course I know that everyone in town knows.” She said angrily and speedily.It was silent in my bedroom aside from the stupid laugh track from the show.”Sorry…It’s just me and Ellie have not seen you for so long.” I feel more guilty than ever. “I’m…I’m sorry,but you know that we have been trying to find Lisa ok.” “Yeah I know…anyway what happened.”

When she asks this question I feel my stomach sink.”Well ummm…another child went missing” Silence “And it was in the same way…door open and slippers and…everything.”“Holy Shit.” That’s all she says,slowly,quietly and shocked.”Whose Kid?” She asked and I responded even though I don’t want to with “Gary’s.” Ashley then just turns the tv off and goes to sleep and I not knowing what to do also go to sleep.

8 kids…8 fucking kids went missing in 1 month,each in the same way as Lisa,as Gary’s kid.Each time a parent comes in I know why and all I can do is listen to the same story I have heard a dozen times and just write it down.I get home at 12 on a Saturday.Ellie is still in bed to my relief and awake.I tuck her into bed and she tells me “I’m..I’m Scared that the man who takes will get me.” I am taken aback by this silly nickname but it must be something she heard from some older kids at school.”Don’t worry honey I will not let anyone harm you.”I say and feel her hair.”Ok but…do you think that’s what Lisa’s dad told her?” I don’t know what to say to this and just say “I don’t know…well you should get some rest.”

A week later it is currently 7 at night and I hear the front door open,I look up scared it will be another parent but my stomach sinks to the bottom of the ocean when I see it’s my wife…eyes full of tears.She doesn't need to tell me what had happened because I already knew,and I knew that I should of spent more time with Ellie.I should of took more days off to spend with my family.If I knew this was going to happen I would of stayed by her side the entire day but I didn’t know this,because I kept telling myself that it would never happen to me,because those parents were the 1 percent but turns out I was the 1 Percent this whole time.

After Ellie disappeared no kids disappeared from town again,it had stopped,as if Ellie was the last one because it was a warning,a warning to cherish your family because I had not cherished them enough.I had been too busy trying to help other families that I forgot about my own until it was too late.I quit my Job 5 Months later and got a divorce 2 years later.Most days I just drank myself through them,living in a shitty motel.

One Month it rained for the whole of it.The most rain this town had ever seen.One day it stopped raining so I took the opportunity to go for a walk.I walked through the park until something caught my eye…a hand buried in the mud.A child's hand.I dug it up and sure enough it was Lisa in the pyjamas her parents described she was wearing the night of her disappearance.I Stumbled around seeing all the other 8 kids.Their bodies had resurfaced due the rain,and then I saw her…Ellie.I ran to her and held her tight crying.And as I held her I heard more people walking into the park and their reactions to what they saw,but I didn’t care I was finally with my daughter again,after I waited holding her slippers every day staring at them.I had finally reunited with my daughter and I could not have been happier.

Because let's be honest loving BL doesn't give us a free pass to ignore the industry's darker side.

This might sting. Scratch that it should sting.
BL and the fantasy machine

———

Defining the basics:

———-

What is a ship?

A ship (short for ""relationship"") is a projection.
It's when fans imagine or support a romantic (or platonic) relationship between two people
real or tictional.
Example: seeing two actors laughing together and saying, ""I ship them.""

Important: A ship is not reality. It's an interpretation, a mental game. It doesn't mean the people involved are actually together, nor does it mean they owe fans any behavior to validate the ship.

———

What is a fetish?

A fetish, in this context, is an obsession or sexual fixation on a characteristic, act, or type of relationship. Here it can look like:
Over-sexualizing two male actors who work together.
Reducing LGBTQ actors (or actors playing
LGBTQ roles) into live-action fantasy props for fan gratification.
This is where it gets dangerous: turning human beings into ""living fantasies"" without respect for their boundaries or reality.
Why does this matter?
Because many fans forget that actors aren't

Why does this matter?
Because many fans forget that actors aren't fanfic characters. They're not dolls existing to fulfill fan expectations. Whether a ship is ""real"" or not, the actors don't owe us any off-screen validation or performance.
Key takeaway to hammer home:

""A ship is a theory. Not a reality.""
""A fetish is dehumanization. Not support.""

———-

Erotization:
This is the process of assigning erotic meaning to something or someone that didn't have it in the first place.
Example: two friends holding hands innocently, but fans turning it into ""undeniable sexual tension.""
Summary: turning the innocent into ""sexy"" through your own lens.

———-

Sexualization

This is when a person (or group) is reduced to their sexual attributes or seen primarily as a sexual being, rather than as a whole human with depth and complexity.
Example: commenting on an actor's body instead of their talent.
Summary: perceiving someone through a purely sexual lens often without their consent.

———-

Hypersexualization

This is sexualization turned up to 100. It's when everything, gestures, words, photos, even the most basic interactions, gets interpreted sexually. It's also when industries deliberately push this to sell (hello, fanservice).
Example: forcing two young actors to act like a couple for screaming fans, just to boost ticket sales.
Summary: an overdose of sexualization, erasing the person's boundaries and humanity.
""Erotization, sexualization, hypersexualization: three stages of the same poison. It starts as a fantasy and ends as an industry.""


✨❤️———-FANSERVICE.————❤️✨

What is fanservice?
Fanservice is the ancient, sacred, and extremely profitable art of giving fans exactly what they want... even if it's got ZERO connection to reality.
It's when two actors (or characters) pretend to be super close, act all couple-y, or straight up behave like they're married just so you'll scream ""OMGGG THEY'RE SO REAL while clutching your phone like it's holy scripture.
Yes, they hold hands.
Yes, they gaze at each other like it's a K-drama slow-mo scene.
Yes, they send heart emojis like lovesick teens.
But the second the cameras stop rolling, each one goes home to eat their fried rice ALONE.
Or with their reals girlfriends and boyfriends
Why do they use it?
Because:
It sells. Tickets. Events. Photobooks. Posters.
T-shirts. Mugs. Even pillows shaped like their heads.

It keeps fans hooked. The more you believe
""they're secretly in love,"" the more cash you throw at their joint projects.
It creates hype. Twitter trends. TikTok edits.
Fan wars. And the company behind it 're laughing all the way to the bank.
So yeah fanservice is just smart marketing.
Think of it as Santa Claus for adults who refuse to admit he's not real.

Definition For a 7-year-old:👶

""Fanservice is when two people pretend to be in love because it makes fans happy. But it's just pretend, like when you play house and act like mommy and daddy with your dolls. Once the game's over, everyone goes home.""
You know what absolutely kills me about these actors? Like l've said before they're grown adults. Fully aware of what they signed up for.
And you, dear fans... let me remind you, you're grown adults too. Or at least you're supposed to be. You know what you're consuming, and if you don't, let me spell it out for you in giant neon letters:


+❤️✨THE BL INDUSTRY IS NOT A MATCHMAKING SERVICE✨❤️ +

It's not Tinder. It's not Bumble. It's not Grindr.
It's not Hinge. It's not whatever dating app you've been swiping on at 3AM when loneliness hits. This isn't a matchmaking service where actors magically find their ""one true love"" on set.

The BL world is a business, babe. It's about selling dreams, illusions, and aesthetic couple moments for cash. You're not just shipping them for free, you're literally funding their careers and lining the pockets of the companies behind them. 
And hey, props to you for making their managers rich while they sip iced americanos in office chairs.
But here's what really cracks me up:
You all KNOW fanservice works because you believe these pairings are real. That belief drives ticket sales, merchandise, and endless engagement. And sure, if the actors actually were real couples and decided to monetize their relationship, they could probably rake in even more cash. No middleman. No agency taking a cut. Just pure, unfiltered ""we're in love"" content.
But you know why they won't do it?
Because a REAL relationship doesn't sell like that.

And if it ever does, it won't survive the circus you turn it into.

Lets me explain, When you expose a real relationship to this level of public scrutiny, to obsessive shipping, to invasive comments, to every move being dissected like it's CSI Bangkok it falls apart. That's not just me saying it; it's common sense. Real couples don't thrive under a spotlight where millions feel entitled to their private life.

So if even authentic couples struggle when they're overexposed, what makes you think a fake couple, two co-workers doing their damn job, will magically ""fall in love"" because they held hands for a photoshoot? No, sweetheart.
That's not how life works.

The irony is that: These actors could probably make bank showing off their real partners. But they don't. Because they know one simple truth:
A real relationship, when sold like a
product, gets ruined.
So next time you convince yourself that all those heart eyes and back hugs mean they're secretly soulmates, take a deep breath and remember: It's. Just. Marketing.

BL has evolved, or should I say mutated, into a money-making machine that turns (often very young) actors into living, breathing fantasy objects.
Fanservice? Check.
Forced skinship at events? Check.

Lives where fans beg them to ""do something cute together""? Triple check.
Every single detail is carefully engineered to feed the fanbase's collective imagination. It's like giving sugar to a toddler and wondering why they're bouncing off the walls.
But at what point do we admit it's gone too far?

When fans start writing smut about real people?
When actors are asked about their ""first time"" in interviews like it's cute? Or who's top or bottom!
Or when their mental health quietly collapses under the weight of all this ""love""?
Because: it's not just ""innocent fun"". It's a whole system profiting off human beings treated like toys

Let's get real, fanservice isn't just harmless
""content"" anymore. It's a carefully crafted strategy designed to sell fantasy.

Two actors hold hands on stage? Fans scream.
One accidentally brushes the other's arm?
Fans write novels about it.
They're asked in interviews to recreate romantic scenes or ""act like boyfriends."" And if they hesitate? Suddenly they're ""cold"" or ""ungrateful to the fandom.""
Babes, these men aren't dolls you can dress up and script to fit your imagination.
It gets worse. 

And that's kill me, 
Many fans demanding this behavior don't even understand the reality of LGBTQ+
relationships. They hypersexualize same-sex couples without knowing the first thing about the lives or struggles of the people they're fetishizing. It's the same energy as someone claiming to be an ""ally"" but voting against gay marriage because ""it's too political.""
The irony is delicious and tragic.

""They're colleagues, not conjoined twins.
Chill.""

Let's have an honest moment, This weird obsession y'all have with tying EVERYTHING an actor does back to their co-star... it's exhausting. Not for me. For them.
Imagine this:

You're at your job. You have a coworker, you're not particularly close, but you get along fine because... professionalism. Now imagine every time you post on Facebook or IG, your family, your friends, your entire hometown comments:

""OMG!! Did you send that lunch pic to Linda?
""You look happy... must be because of Linda, huh? 
""Ugh, stop working alone. We only wanna see you with Linda!!""

Now imagine you're actually dating someone else. Or, hell, even married. But nope, every single thing you do, even at your WEDDING, people are screaming about Linda.
Wouldn't you lose your damn mind?
Reminder: BL actors are not in love.
They're colleagues. They're coworkers.
They're paid to sell you chemistry. That's their job. It's not a dating show. It's not The Bachelor. It's business. It's contracts. It's marketing. It's money.

Yes, sometimes two actors genuinely become friends (rare). And sometimes, extremely rarely, they fall in love. But the vast majority?
The moment the director yells ""CUT,"" they go home and live completely separate lives. They
don't even text unless it's work-related.


Reality check: Sexuality is not fanservice.
A straight man isn't going to magically fall in love with another man because you made an edit with sad music and sparkles. A gay man isn't going to ""switch teams"" because your ship hashtag is trending. 
People are gay, straight, bi, whatever, and that's WHO THEY ARE. You can't change it by yelling louder on Twitter. I repeat, Sexuality doesn't work like fanservice.

Straight actors don't suddenly become gay because they filmed a kissing scene. Gay actors don't stop being gay because they acted straight in a movie. And bisexual actors don't disappear off the planet if they date a woman.

The BL industry doesn't care about that nuance. Neither do many fans. It's all about selling you ""hearts in their eyes"" fantasies to keep you spending money on photobooks, fan meetings, and livestreams.

The coworker obsession is not cute. It's
сгееру.

Imagine you're at your job. You're polite with Linda from Accounting. You've even shared a
few laughs during coffee breaks. But now:

• Every time you upload a selfie on
Instagram, people tag Linda.
• You mention liking pizza. Fans: ""Linda
loves pizza too
it's fate.""
• You say ""I'm tired today."" Fans: ""Did you
spend the night with Linda? Og""
You sneeze. ""Bless you but I bet Linda
blessed you first”

It's not funny anymore, right?
Like I said, Now imagine you're actually dating someone else IRL. Or you're married. Or you're single and just want people to leave you the hell alone.

This is what BL actors live every single day.
Their entire existence reduced to the ""couple brand"".

—-

Example: MewGulf (TharnType)
MewGulf were one of the most successful BL pairs in history. But after their series ended?
Fans couldn't handle them doing solo projects.
Every single move they made was dissected like:
""Why isn't Gulf at Mew's event? Did
they fight? Is the ship sinking?
""Gulf liked a picture of a girl... betrayal!!

Meanwhile, both men were busy building individual careers. Mew is in movies now. Gulf has solo endorsements. But to many fans?
They're ""traitors"" for moving on.

—-

Example: BrightWin (2gether)
Bright and Win literally said in interviews they are not a real couple. Fans didn't care. They kept asking them about living together, vacations together, even their future wedding.
When Bright was spotted with a girlfriend, the fandom went feral. Death threats, mass unfollows, hashtags to ""cancel"" him. All because... he's straight.
If your love for a ""ship"" turns into harassment when the actors breathe separately, congrats, you're not a fan. You're a parasite.

—-

Example: TayNew (Dark Blue Kiss)
Tay and New are openly best friends. They've said it. Repeatedly. Fans? ""They're lying.
They're secretly married.
New with his girlfriend? Fans? ""He's using her to hide his relationship with Tay."" This is mental gymnastics at Olympic level.

—-

Let's not even talk about + ZeeNunew The day that little contractual bubble bursts?
Y'all are going to see that MewGulf was child's play compared to what's coming. I'm not exaggerating, when that Air Contract ™ expires, the collective meltdown is going to make Chernobyl look like a scented candle accident.

Here's the thing guys: fanservice isn't love.
Fanservice isn't marriage. Fanservice is literally two people clocking in for work and yet, you treat it like they're submitting their wedding papers at city hall.

And the worst part is that You KNOW it's fanservice. Deep down, in that last rational neuron of your brain, you know. But God forbid someone points it out to you, you suddenly transform into rabid defense attorneys for a relationship that never existed. 
You swear on your grandma's grave that ""it's real"" because he looked at him for 2.4 seconds longer than usual in a livestream. 

And when the actors themselves finally say, ""Hey.. it was fanservice. It's our job."" what do you do? You call them liars. You say they betrayed you. YOU turn on them.
They never lied to you. You lied to yourself. You built your own little fairytale, moved into it rent-free, and now you're mad that reality came knocking.

Look at what's happening with Aou and Boom.
Y'all are out here pressuring people to unfollow, block, and even cut ties with their real-life partners... all because it doesn't fit your fantasy. Like... do you hear yourselves?
That's not support. That's harassment disguised as ""loyal shipping."" And ""we protect their careers ""your delusions yes.

I'm gonna tell you a little secret: you really think that just because they block(unfollow) each other on Instagram, it means they've broken up?
Oh honey. Instagram is for you.
Real life is for them. Blocking, unfollowing, no liking each other online doesn't mean they're not still sharing noodles in bed at 2 AM. It just means they're hiding from YOU. Because you're embarrassing.

At this point, I'm convinced some of you won't believe fanservice is fake until there's a literal funeral. And even then, you'll stand at the grave like,

""But... but... maybe he's faking his death so they can run away together in peace?""
Y'all need to touch grass. Actually no, eat the grass. Straight from the ground. Maybe the fiber will clear out whatever delusion is clogging your system.

—-

Let's use Jeff Satur as an example.
You see Jeff, literally with his girlfriend. She's there. Front row at every concert. Always by his side. But noooo, in your delusional little BL fandom brain, she's just his ""manager."" Or maybe ""an ex they're still friends with."" Or wait
""they're not together anymore.""

You people really said: ""Ignore the literal girlfriend. Ignore the vacations. Ignore the public dates. Ignore the handholding. My ship is canon.""

It's like entering the BL world flips a switch in your brain. Suddenly reality stops existing.
You Do This With Everyone

—-

Take Off and his girlfriend. You'll say:
""Oh, they broke up years ago.""
Really? Is that why they still travel together today? Why she's literally with him everywhere?

And don't even get me started on the Nanon stans. Nanon and his girlfriend?
""Fake.""
""It's PR.""
""They're just friends.""

Meanwhile the guy is living his best life with her, but you're still shipping him with men he doesn't even speak to anymore. And who's living his best life too. But you spoil their project because they don't care about your tantrums. Awwww grown babies 🥺.

The BL Delusion Olympics
Here's where it gets funny.
When these actors are seen holding hands, going out to restaurants, literally doing all the couple stuff with their real partners, your first reaction is:
""Nah... just friends.""
But the minute their male co-star breathes in their direction?

""OH MY GOD, DID YOU SEE THAT? HE LOVES HIM. HE'S SO IN LOVE. THE WAY HE BREATHED WAS ROMANTIC.""

Like, are you hearing yourselves?
Est gets his meat grilled by William once because he was busy on the phone(like always btwes, surely with his real partner) and suddenly it's a ""romantic gesture."" I mean... do you want to believe William is out here performing acts of undying love with Est just
because of grilled meat?

Even Est told you that it's normal. You need someone who love you in your life's guys seriously.

Babes: It wasn't romantic. He was just... grilling meat.

The Misogyny Behind Your Delusions

Now let's talk about Mile and his girlfriend.
You say:

""She's manipulating him.""
""She's toxic.""
""They're not together.""

Excuse me? What exactly are you smoking?
It's misogyny. Period. You don't like women being in their lives because it ruins your ships.
So you invent narratives:

""She's evil.""
• ""She's PR.""
""She's just a friend.""

But let me tell you something brutal:
These boys are not marrying their co-actors.
They are marrying their girlfriends. They're building lives with women. THEY. ARE.
STRAIGHT, of course some love men too and they gonna marry men they love no their coactors. (Or at least not obligated to be your
yaoi fantasy.)


❤️✨The Hypocrisy❤️✨

When it's your fanfics? Your horny Twitter threads? Your overanalysis of them grazing fingers during a scene? That's okay.
But when they're actually holding hands with their partner?

""He said he's single!""
""They've never kissed anyone before!""
Are you serious? These are grown men. Do you really think they've never kissed anyone?
Never dated? Never had sex? You really think they're waiting for their BL co-star to fulfill your delusions?

Be so serious.

—-✨❤️family, friends❤️✨—

And let's not even get started on the families and friends who hop on the fanservice train.

Oh yes especially those so-called ""friends"" who suddenly become PR machines, posting, hinting, dropping suggestive comments... all because they want a slice of that sweet, sweet BL cash flow. And the fans? Y'all are sitting there like:

""NO! Noooo! This is real! Their bestie would NEVER lie!""

Really? 😂😭REAL by what metric? Let me break
it to you gently, everyone around them is playing the same game. It's business, sweetheart. Cold, hard, profitable business.
When there are people stupid enough to throw money at a pair of actors because they held hands, you bet everyone's going to get in on the action.

Friends? Check.
Siblings? Check.
Parents? Oh honey, even parents will cash in when it works. Why wouldn't they?

I don't even blame them. Honestly, I respect the hustle. If I were in their shoes and saw thousands of grown adults foaming at the mouth over whether two guys brushed knees on camera, l'd monetize your delusions too. I'd be like:

""Sure babe, they're totally dating. Buy the photobook for proof.""😌

But let's talk about the one thing that truly sends me into orbit, when a ""friend"" goes out of their way to say something like:

""Oh no, l've never seen him kiss anyone in real life.""

Excuse me? A little respect, please. Both for yourself and for your friend. What purpose does that statement even serve? 

Are you trying to sell your buddy as some sort of kiss-virgin saint to maintain the fantasy? Or are you just fishing for attention and clout from the fandom because you know they'll lap it up like starving kittens?

And the kicker? This same ""friend"" was present on the set when the actor shot an entire kissing scene. Like... were you wearing a blindfold that day? Or does a scripted kiss not count because it wasn't in your presence during brunch?

Seriously. Stop using your proximity to these people as a marketing tool. Stop talking about your friend's love life like it's public property.
Whether they've kissed someone or not, slept with someone or not, it's NONE of your damn business to parade that info around. And it sure as hell isn't the fandom's business either.
Because here's the ugly truth:

All of this, friends dropping crumbs, family making suggestive comments, the endless innuendos, is part of the package. It's not real.
It's not cute. It's not ""oh they're so comfortable with each other's families""

They're doing it because it WORKS. And as long as you keep eating it up, they'll keep serving it.

And the day the contract gonna end, y'all gonna cry and they gonna don't give a fuck. , these moments are always so funny.

The Hard Truth about the hypocrisy you put when they're with their reals girlfriend and boyfriend.

These actors are human beings. They eat.
They breathe. They have relationships. They have sex lives. And none of it involves their male co-stars, or you.

You think William is jealous every time Est hangs out with another man? You think Mile's girlfriend is manipulating him? You think Off's girlfriend doesn't exist anymore?
No. You're just so far gone in your fantasy you can't recognize reality even when it's posted on Instagram.

Reality Hurts, Right!😂

So let's break this down one last time:
They're dating women or men who are not their costars.

They're sleeping with women or men who are not their costars.

They're probably going to marry them.
They are not dating their BL co-stars.
They are not dating you.

Stop treating their coworkers like placeholders for your wet dreams. Stop erasing the women in their lives. Stop pretending you have a right to dictate their relationships because you bought a photobook.

If they're holding hands with their girlfriends(bfs) every single day, traveling, and having dinner dates, maybe, just maybe, they're in love. But hey, keep believing the grilled meat was the peak of romance.

The delusion is free, Reality is brutal.
Just Reminder:Fanservice is not consent.
Just because they smiled for the cameras doesn't mean you own their lives.
Even fanservice has limits.

You want your favorite BL pair to ""act like bovfriends"" 24/7. Cute. But did vou know:

Some actors have spoken about being
uncomfortable during fan events?

• Others have had anxiety attacks
because fans demand hugs, kisses, or worse
""touch his abs for us"" ON STAGE.

Agencies force them to comply
because it sells.
It's exploitation.

Example: PerthSaint (Love by Chance)
When they stopped doing fanservice, fans accused them of ""hating each other."" Perth even said in an interview he felt like he couldn't be himself because fans were obsessed with seeing him as ""Saint's boyfriend.""

Double Standard Watch:

If a female idol is asked to kiss her co-star at a fan meeting, everyone screams harassment.
But when it's two male BL actors? ""OMG it's so cute more pls!!""

It's still harassment. You're just too blinded by your fantasies to see it.
These actors aren't dolls in a dollhouse for you to pair off like Barbie and Ken.
They're human beings. Let them breathe.
""But we want more events with them as a
couple!!""
I heard a girl (probably 11 years old, judging by the logic) whining about William and Est doing
solo projects. 
She said, ""Why won't they give us couple events? We want them as a couple.""
Honey. Baby. Sweet summer child.

Couple events mean MONEY for their agency, not LOVE for you. You want them locked in a box doing fanservice 24/7 so you can fantasize in peace. 

But : they're human beings with individual careers and dreams. Not vending machines for serotonin.

Let them work solo. Let them exist solo. Let them breathe solo.
Their lives don't orbit each other just because your delusions do.
Bonus food for thought:
The day one of them dates someone (male OR female), y'all will lose your minds because you confused acting with reality. Stop setting yourselves up for heartbreak.
""William is jealous? Est is someone's
property? Be serious.""

Let's get this straight (pun fully intended). I need to talk about it:
You guys have literally turned William into what? A possessive Wattpad boyfriend written
by a 13-year-old who thinks toxic = romantic?
Est is not his property. Repeat after me:
""Est. Is. Not. William's. Property.""

Good. Let's continue.
Every single time Est breathes in the general direction of another living organism (man, woman, plant, cat...), we get:
""OMG William must be dying inside f
DYING OF WHAT EXACTLY? Jealousy? Rage?
A severe allergy to seeing Est talk to other humans?
William has a life. He probably has friends, even a relationship (yes, shocking, I know). You think he's sitting in a dark room clutching a photo of Est every time Est smiles at someone else? Grow up.

William according to the wedgie fandom:

Est eats lunch → ""William is crying
because he wasn't there.""
• Est posts a selfie → ""William is jealous
because someone else took the photo.""
• Est breathes → ""William is mad
because that oxygen isn't his.""
Seriously?

Reality check for the fandom wedgies:
1. William has literally said in interviews that he's not possessive. But you lot keep projecting this creepy Wattpad dynamic onto him like he's incapable of existing as his own person.
2. In real life, this kind of behavior? It's not cute. It's controlling. It's toxic. And y'all need to stop romanticizing it.

Imagine this IRL:
You're working with a colleague, minding your own business. You wave hello to someone else. Suddenly a mob of strangers on Twitter is like:

""OMG HOW COULD YOU? William must be heartbroken. YOU'RE SO CRUEL
Be honest wouldn't you find that disturbing?
And embarrassing.
You think you're protecting William by making him out to be this obsessive, jealous mess. But all you're really doing is disrespecting him.
You're reducing him to a one-dimensional trope whose existence revolves entirely around
Est.

Let's be real:
* William isn't an accessory in Est's life.
• Est isn't an extension of William.
• They're two individuals with their own careers, families, friends, and YES, their own love lives.
It's time to grow up. Fanservice isn't marriage.
And let's talk about the mental toll. Actors, especially those new to the industry, are pressured to act like perfect boyfriend material 24/7. God forbid they date a woman (man). God forbid they set boundaries. God forbid they stop holding hands on stage.

It's no longer fanservice. It's performance under duress. A thin line between fantasy and exploitation.
The uncomfortable reality, When fanservice becomes exploitation
So let's stop pretending. Fanservice in BL isn't just cute little crumbs for shippers. It's a full-blown marketing strategy and it's incredibly effective.

The business model is simple:

1. Find two young, attractive men.
2. Package their every interaction as
""romantic"" for the cameras.
3. Watch as fans lose their minds over a hand on a shoulder or a shared water bottle.
4. Sell tickets, merch, and photo books at triple the price.

This isn't friendship. It isn't love. It's capitalism wearing a pride flag and saying ""Yass queen.""
The darker side: selling intimacy
Let's call it what it is, emotional pornography.
These actors are constantly pushed to perform intimacy:
Feeding each other.
Whispering in each other's ears during lives.
Being asked by MCs, ""Who's the top? Who's the bottom?"" in front of hundreds of screaming fans.
Do you think that's normal? Do you think that's

Do you think that's normal? Do you think that's healthy?

This is especially harmful in cultures where
LGBTQ+ identities are still marginalized. While BL rakes in millions, real queer people face discrimination daily and yet their stories are sanitized for hetero women's consumption.
The irony? These same fans who scream
""support LGBTQ+"" often don't know a damn thing about actual queer relationships. They think ""two guys in love"" automatically means BDSM dynamics, public groping, or wild fanfiction tropes. Meanwhile, the actors, many of whom are straight, are forced to play along to keep their jobs.

The elephant in the room: consent
Let's get uncomfortable. Can we even talk about consent here?
These boys sign contracts at 18, promising to sell a ""ship"" for years.
They're told how to touch, when to smile, what captions to post, and how to address each other online.
They're trained to flirt on stage and avoid clarifying anything in interviews because
""ambiguity sells.""
This isn't about ""acting."" It's about
manufacturing a fantasy. And if they ever step out of line date a woman, show less chemistry, refuse to engage the fans explode in hate.

You know what absolutely kills me? many of these so-called ""BL actors"" aren't even talented. Like... at all. They're not actors.
They're just pretty faces with good genetics and a skincare routine. And you can always tell because the second their pairing collapses, poof, their careers vanish faster than their fake chemistry ever did.
It's not rocket science: they never had anything else to offer. No acting chops. No charisma.
No range. Just a symmetrical face and the ability to smirk in an interview. And instead of their agencies doing the bare minimum, like enrolling them in acting classes, helping them learn how to project real emotions, or teaching them to read a script without sounding like Siri on Ambien, they double down.
""No need to improve your craft, sweetie. Just sell more hand-holding and heart-eyes. The fans eat it up.""
And the fans? Oh, don't even get me started.
They're out here telling these boys lies:
""You're AMAZING! You're the BEST ACTOR EVER!""

Best actor ever? Really? Sis, are we watching the same drama? Because I swear the guy has two expressions: ""I'm shy"" and ""I'm constipated."" He couldn't even fake cry if you threatened to take away his hair serum sponsorship.

Then comes the dangerous part. This poor pretty boy starts believing his own hype. He starts thinking:

""Yeah... maybe I could do big films. Maybe I am the next Leonardo DiCaprio.""

😅My dude... no. No, you're not. You couldn't even convince me you were in love with your co-actor when the entire script and camera angles were doing 90% of the work for you.
You're not ready for a Nolan film, you're barely ready for a toothpaste commercial.

Here's a radical idea, an amazing, maybe y'all never think about it in a so called cinema industry :

Instead of wasting all that fanservice energy faking relationships, why not... I don't know...
STUDY ACTING? Maybe take a theater course?
Work on your craft so you're not completely useless when the BL cash cow dies?
Because I'm gonna tell you an another secret:
Being pretty only gets you so far.

Eventually, people want to see talent. And if all you've got is cheekbones and the ability to hold your co-actor's hand convincingly, guess what? You're replaceable.

Hell, if acting isn't your thing, fine. Find a different talent. Focus on music, directing, cooking shows, I don't care. Just stop pretending you're a real actor because you kissed someone in a rain scene once.

And let's be clear: selling fanservice is already insanely lucrative. You've milked it. Congrats.
But now it's time to invest in yourself before you fade into irrelevance like the rest of the fanservice one-hit wonders. 
Because once the
""ship"" sinks, and they ALWAYS sink, you'll be left with nothing but Instagram thirst traps and a dwindling fanbase still crying over your breakup with your ""co-star boyfriend.""


Why is this dangerous?

Because it's not just fictional. The actors carry the weight of fan projections into their real lives.
Some avoid dating publicly for fear of backlash.
Some are stalked, doxxed, or harassed into staying in their ""assigned ship."" Some burn out completely and leave the industry.
Meanwhile, the fandom keeps screaming, ""It's what the fans want! They're adults, they signed up for this!""
But imagine being 21 and having strangers argue daily about your sex life like it's a Netflix series.

# Divide by Zero

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Reality Manipulation, Math-Based Powers, Infinite Powers, Physics-Based Powers

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 10

**Summary**:

Little Kusuo was told that he couldn't divide by zero, and no matter how hard he tried he was always told that he couldn't. But who says no to a young psychic with super broken powers?

So one day he tried to divide by zero, and he did it! The problem is that automatically every aspect of reality began to double exponentially as he approached zero and everything became infinite.

In the end, the universe couldn't take it anymore and collapsed in on itself leaving young Kusuo in a void of nothingness.

* Kusuo had to restore the entire universe.
* The reason he tried this was for infinite coffee jelly.

I am not free. Never dated or had a relationship before - most my time was spent celibate because sky daddy would be mad. Binned that and started exploring myself over the past couple months despite being late, I was like why tf not.

Met this guy on Tinder. He's about 29, masc. We snapped back and forth for about 3 weeks calling each other baby lol, till he wanted to meet. He's a refugee living in Belfast originally from the middle east- just like me.

Anyways he drove to Dublin to meet me today. We met, it was cool. He pointed out that even though I'm in the closet, people probably know that I'm gay cause it 'seems that way'. I guess I'm not the most masc guy out there. Made me feel like he didn't expect that. I wanted to pay for the food cause he did drive all this way but he ended up paying for both of us which was cool. During his convo with him, mentioning that I'm not exactly a resident here made lights turn off in his eyes. I paid for the parking ticket and the coffee we had later. Went to the beach and just sat in his car talking for about an hour.

He appeared to be very content in his life telling me about his exes and how he spends his time with guys now. How his housemate is my age and bi and goes around dating guys now. I have bpd and have had to manage that on my own throughout my life. Regardless of anyone's personal experiences- it does make general life quite miserable for the average person. It makes me very insecure and self-conscious about things. Hearing him talk about his life, about his housemates life, how he gets to be free- something stirred inside me. Its more longing than jealousy. And I can't seem to let it go.

At this point I knew I liked him a lot but there was seaming awkwardness towards the end. I mentioned maybe I could come to Belfast some time and looked over to him just quiet and smiling awkwardly. I was like perfect drop me off just before the motorway and I'll find my way. He started going in the city center. I was like that's okay just drop me here and I'll find my way. He said 'see you soon' and I left.

This time I snapped him saying, 'Hope it wasn't all too bad. Have a safe trip' He said, 'Don't worry about it. You too.' We ended the night with 1-2 more and now its the next day and I've been on seen zone for hours. I'm trying to hold myself together because rejection is quite stressful for me. I'm not sure what to do. Should I take the hint and move on? Should I ask him what went wrong? Also, would it help for next time to try to be more masc? I don't have any gay friends I can talk to so anything helps. Thanks x",2,1752752720.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

Image Credit: [FreePixel](http://freepixel.com)  
Alright, so I’ll be real with you — I used to feel *so* awkward at parties or networking events. You know that weird panic before you even leave the house, wondering what you’re gonna say, or if you’ll just be standing there, pretending to check your phone? Yeah. That was me.

But I’ve learned over time (and with a lot of trial and error) that confidence in social situations isn’t something you’re born with — it’s something you *build*. You train it like a muscle. It’s not about becoming the most charming person in the room. It’s just about feeling like yourself without fear hijacking your brain.

So if you’re trying to feel less anxious when talking to people — friends, strangers, coworkers, or even at interviews — here’s everything I’ve tried, learned, and actually used that *works*. It’s not magic. It’s just a bit of practice and psychology.

First, know this: You’re not alone. Social anxiety is super common. According to the ADA, like 15 million adults in the U.S. go through it every year. And honestly, that makes sense. The world kind of pushes this idea that everyone’s extroverted and confident all the time — but most people are faking it.

Social anxiety isn’t just “shyness.” It can feel like your heart is racing, your hands are sweaty, and your brain’s doing a 100-lap marathon thinking, “Did I sound stupid?” even hours after the conversation. The fear of judgment or messing up can get so loud you don’t even want to try.

For me, the first step was noticing when that anxiety showed up — like when I couldn’t make eye contact, or when I’d mentally replay a dumb joke I made five hours ago. Once I could recognize the pattern, it was easier to work with it.

Something that helped a *lot* was prepping before social stuff. Like, if I was going to a networking event or meeting new people, I’d take a few minutes to look up what it was about, maybe check out the kind of people who’d be there. Even thinking of a few conversation starters ahead of time made me feel more in control. One that always works: “What brought you here?” It’s neutral, open-ended, and not weird.

And I swear by this — **visualizing success**. I know it sounds woo-woo, but there’s science behind it. There was this study (2020, if I remember right) that said just imagining a positive outcome can reduce anxiety. So before I head out, I literally just close my eyes and picture things going smoothly. Helps reset my nerves.

Also, nonverbal stuff matters more than I realized. Just *standing* like I’m confident — open shoulders, not crossing my arms, looking up instead of down — makes a difference. Not just in how people see me, but in how I feel. Eye contact (not staring, just natural), a genuine smile, and nodding while listening — they seem small but change the vibe instantly.

Now let’s talk about the mind — because negative self-talk is brutal. I used to think “I’ll sound weird” or “Why would anyone care what I say?” That voice can ruin everything. CBT-style thinking helped here. I’d literally write down a bad thought like “I’ll mess this up” and then ask: “Do I have proof of that?” or “What’s the worst that’ll happen if I do?” Replacing those spirals with something like “I’ve handled awkward convos before and survived” helps. Over time, your brain starts to believe you.

If talking makes you nervous, **listening** is your best friend. You don’t have to do all the work. Just listen — really listen — nod, ask follow-up questions, and the conversation usually takes care of itself. People love being heard. When you give them space to talk, it makes *you* seem more confident too.

Also: Start small. I didn’t go from hiding in the corner at parties to giving TED talks. I began with low-pressure stuff — like talking to one person at a coffee shop or messaging someone first on social. Even smiling and saying “hi” to a neighbor. And I celebrated those tiny wins. Because they mattered.

One mindset shift that changed everything: confidence isn’t “either you have it or you don’t.” It grows. You mess up? Cool. Learn from it. Reframe it. That conversation went badly? Maybe it was just off energy. What can I do differently next time?

I also started asking friends for feedback — like, “Hey, did I come off weird during that convo?” And usually, the answer was, “Nah, you were fine.” Which reminded me how distorted our own lens can be.

Extra little things that helped along the way:

* Deep breathing — the 4-7-8 method works like a charm before social events.
* Dressing in something I *like*. Makes me feel like I’m showing up as myself.
* Trying out new things — I joined a small improv group once and it pushed me in a good way. Didn’t even think I’d enjoy it, but it helped a lot.
* Cutting back on alcohol — sounds backwards, but I wanted to build confidence sober. Not with a crutch.

Oh, and **take care of your body**. Not to sound like your gym teacher, but exercise *actually* helps. So does sleeping enough. When I’m exhausted, I’m more anxious, and when I’m feeling good physically, I naturally show up better in convos. Even a walk helps. I also journal after social events — what went well, what didn’t — and just getting it out helps me process.

Here’s what my personal plan looked like, loosely:

* Week 1–2: Just practiced standing tall, did power poses in the mirror (yes, I know), journaled before bed about any interactions.
* Week 3–4: Started actively challenging my negative thoughts. Did “what’s the worst that could happen?” exercises.
* Week 5–6: Started initiating small talk with strangers. Baristas, people in elevators, etc.
* Week 7–8: Tried out harder stuff — like mingling at bigger events or talking in group settings. I’d rate my anxiety level after, and track how it changed over time.

If you feel stuck after all this, therapy can really help. I didn’t start it until later, but CBT especially is gold. Even online versions work now. Therapists can build a step-by-step exposure plan with you, which makes the process smoother.

So yeah, that’s everything I wish someone had told me sooner. If you’re working on this — I see you. It’s not about becoming the loudest person in the room. It’s about being able to *be yourself* in the room without fear running the show.

I’ve been back in the city for a week, working from my hotel and was getting ready to go home this weekend. Now I need to stay an extra week and I’m feeling pretty down. I’ve loved northern Greece but I’m ready to go home. I don’t have time to do another trip outside of the city and don’t want to rent a car again.

I feel like I’m running out of “fun” ways to keep myself occupied when I’m not at work or the hospital. 

Can anyone recommend an event or a destination or experience for this weekend? I’m open to places on public transit or less than 60 euro taxi round trip, live music, art events, etc. I’ve had enough beach for now!

I 37F met my now husband 40M 10 years ago after a string of bad relationships and situations.  He was so charming and active, respectful of my privacy and wanting boundaries around being introduced to my two young children until we had dated enough to know if we wanted to pursue things seriously.  I knew 6 months into dating that I loved him and he could tell that I was smitten.  He let me know he wasn’t there yet and wasn’t going to say it until he was sure which was refreshing at the time to have an honest mature conversation.  My dad passed away unexpectedly about a year into us dating and he showed up!  He came with me to meet my father on his deathbed to introduce himself, came straight to my house regardless of my two children to be there for support and finally met my beautiful children.  After that I was elated when he said he felt the same and loved me!  We got serious and started looking for houses to move into.  I had horrible credit and learned a lot about financial literacy from him as he is very intelligent.  Being a single mom with no help was hard on me but I took care of them with no assistance so I have always been proud of that.  I found out about 6 months into searching I was pregnant despite using birth control and preventative measures like using plan b when necessary.  We went into the office and it was an ectopic pregnancy and I was crushed.  I had an emergency C section because in removing the fetus the cut my artery and I lost blood fast.  I had my first 2 naturally so this was really painful and I was still dealing with the loss of a child I couldn’t have.  Work family and then boyfriend were so supportive.  We eventually find a house and while it was in his name and his down payment I contributed $5,000 along with his parents.  We did renovations and on Christmas Eve we got engaged.  We had our minor disagreements and he is very specific when it comes to logic and sense.  He is OCD a little and has ADD.  We keep all of our finances separate but agreed he would pay mortgage I would pay all other bills.  I took on and paid off all brand new furniture for the house and appliances.  I paid for the new roof and etc over time as over the years I have tripled my salary and make very very good bonuses that allow us to continue to live comfortably.  He was always the one to decide what to do with that money because he said I was horrible with money.  We get pregnant as planned, Covid hit, and his father started having major health issues.  Needless to say things were stressful and right when larger issues started happening.  Every problem turned into a massive screaming tantrum calling me names like c**t, Bi**h, fat, lazy, etc.  divorce was threatened every time and has gone as far as packing my bags and throwing them at me.  I get pregnant right after it first child together was born and within that time his father passed way.  The arguments happened more often and had a much larger focus on me after his dad passed.  Over these past 2 years I have had water thrown on me twice by him, Luke warm coffee, and always hearing divorce every argument.  I love this man and can’t fathom why he would want to test some one this way.  He is an amazing father who cares so much about those children.  He is just so specific for example of they want to go to a park he loves fishing so it has to be at one where he can fish at the same time.  If we go on vacation it has to be somewhere he can fish and at a beach.  If the children do activities and sports and he felt they misbehaved or it was too much time commitment from him being able to do things we couldn’t do them or he wouldn’t allow them to go as a punishment.  These instances were more spaced out and I always understood stressors that could have caused those outburst like losing his job and not being motivated to find one for a whole year.  He is so smart and makes really good money so that was a hard year on the relationship with two under one years old and nothing but video games and watching kids during Covid.  I almost lost my life to blood clots and had major health issues which he was there for but until there was concrete proof that something was wrong for months I was crazy or making a huge deal out of nothing.  Since the kids and health issues I gained a lot of weight.  We come to a couple months where I have hit a point that I don’t can salvage this relationship.  My daughter was playing in her toy car and injured herself the day of his 40th bday party.  As people are arriving I had to take her to the ER for the first hour to get an xray.  They think it was broke but wasn’t sure and we made it back to the party.  Everything seemed fine till everyone went home and he screamed about my embarrassment of him needing to tell people I broke my child’s arm letting her play down a hill and I left him to host his own party, which I had all set up already.  He slept on the couch and the next morning we get woke up to shattering glass and screaming of that B***h can clean it up breaking our child’s arm.  I had to go clean up a broken jelly jar and a shattered coffee mug he threw.  When I went to put shoes on he grew his coke can at my head but luckily I ducked.  He was screaming profanities as I was cleaning and throwing his phone at the wall.  I couldn’t take it any more and told him I wanted a divorce.  He flipped a 180 when he saw I was serious and it was the first time in 10 years I uttered those words.  He begged, sobbed, pleaded until 5:30 am and I said fine but we need to work on it and we needed counseling.  I left for a work trip and injured myself day 2.  Instead of concern I got the you need to be more careful lecture and how could 1 million other people not have that happen rolling an ankle but because I wasn’t paying attention I was at fault.  I was floored.  When I got back home I was emotionally and sexually so turned off I told him I didn’t want to do anything I wasn’t in the mood.  He kept sending me sexually based videos, making comments every time we talked, and even got me gifts like lingerie.  This all came to a head 2 days before our vacation and he asked for a blow job and I said not tonight I took all 4 kids to the aquarium, butterfly conservatory and playground by myself and was exhausted.  He was livid and screaming at me that I said this was over I can’t do this psychological warfare anymore.  He went from begging to screaming to begging to screaming and even brought it out to our children asking them who they wanted to live with and I was giving up on our marriage and all over asking for a blowjob.  Then he apologized and begged again for forgiveness.  I told him we needed marriage counseling or I wasn’t doing it anymore.  We go on vacation and we get out of the car from a 15 hour drive and finally hit the pillows at 2:30 am.  He tries to start kissing me and I tell him I want to set boundaries and expectations.  It turned into the next three days of all day lectures on not being intimate on vacation isn’t normal and acceptable to I’m cheating on him to I’m trying to divorce him behind his back and take his house and turn the kids against him.  I didn’t argue, yell, I barely spoke.  He just kept having this dialogue with himself.  He apologized and the last 2 days of vacation were okay.  He struggled with not being intimate and it shows but I just can’t bring myself to want that right now.  I have been trying to communicate my feelings because I am a person who shuts down and survives for my kiddos.  We had marriage counseling session and I couldn’t even agree that I was all in and he keeps pressuring me to make a decision.  I feel torn because of external opinions and family saying “well if he’s willing to change give him a chance”.  They haven’t been in this 10 year cycle of I have been all in and I don’t know if I can take another tantrum or the pressure or the selfishness.  Help?  Am I giving up to easily?  Am I destroying my family for being selfish?  Can I really be All in after this?",3,1752752478.0,relationship_advice,11,0.8,False

I’m extremely new to cold brew and my question is essentially the title. I was looking through the sub trying to find answers but became a little confused and figured that a post would help since I can ask more questions to active users if need be.

That being said I bought [this coffee](https://a.co/d/83y0mJx) sock since I saw it recommended in an older post. I decided to get one mainly because I was annoyed by how long it took to filter that much coffee through both a strainer and cheesecloth then a coffee filter. I used grinds that were meant to be for espresso (cafe bustelo) so they were very fine (which apparently is not good lol but I’m not sure why) and the taste came out to be kinda funny and I don’t think the caffeine content was that strong.

And when I say strong, I do mean strong lol. I love a strong coffee flavor but I’m not a huge fan of bitterness. Again; preferably high caffeine. I drink a lot of energy drinks which each one is about 200mg or so… I know it’s not the best habit but it’s just until I finish school.

My job just barely pays enough for me to pay bills (my dependency on energy drinks) and cover my classes and such, so I’d prefer options where I don’t need to buy a grinder. However, if you feel like there’s a certain kind of coffee bean out there that fits perfectly and I absolutely need a grinder because it’ll be a worthwhile purchase, please offer some economic options.

Also please recommend what you guys use to flavor, if anything at all. I always see things like vanilla or salted caramel in the store bought/canned cold brews and tbh that does interest me.

# Chapter 38: A Christmas Morning Resolve

The hotel room was dark.

Chizuru hadn’t bothered with the lights when she entered. The curtains stayed shut. Only the LED clock glowed—a sharp, indifferent 11:48 p.m.

Her coat slipped from her shoulders and crumpled by the door. Her bag fell next, landing with a dull thud. Then her knees buckled.

She sat against the wall—hands trembling, breaths uneven.

No glasses. No smile. No mask.

Her eyes were swollen. Her cheek burned where Elsa's hand had struck. Her lips pale and cracked from the December wind. Skin blotched, not with makeup, but memory.

She wasn’t Chizuru Mizuhara tonight.

Not the polished actress. Not the fantasy-for-rent. Not the too-composed girl everyone envied for her poise.

Just a twenty-year-old woman...

Who had shattered her own heart. Again.

His name was barely a whisper. Her voice felt foreign in her own mouth. She pressed her knuckles to her lips, trying to swallow the sob, but it came anyway—raw, sharp, aching.

It wasn’t loud. But it was honest. The kind of sound you only make when no one’s watching.

""I blew it,"" she choked. The words scraped out like broken glass. ""I had him. I *had* him. And I told myself... letting go was the right thing. That waiting was the mature choice.""

She laughed—harsh, hollow. A jagged sound with no real humor, only bitterness.

""I was so fucking proud of my walls.""

Her phone buzzed faintly, then dimmed again. A voicemail. Mini’s last message.

*You’re not alone, Chizuru.*

But she didn’t reach for it. Didn’t move.

She curled her knees to her chest. And finally let herself fall apart.

""I quit the rental job,"" she whispered into the dark. ""I’ve got projects lined up... TV, film, commercials...""

She squeezed her eyes shut. As if willing the world to disappear.

""If I walk away from those... I lose everything I’ve built. But if I walk away from *him* again...""

A sob cracked her in two.

""Why is it always a choice? Why does destiny give me everything only to make me choose between the man I love and the life I bled for?""

She clenched the hem of her sweater in her fists. Her voice, by now, was a breath.

*Kazuya... I would've given it all up if you asked me.* *I would've thrown it all away... if it meant being enough for you again.*

But he didn’t ask.

He didn’t beg. He didn’t plead.

He said he needed space. Time. Healing.

And worst of all—

He told her not to contact him.

*If you really want to see me again,* he said, *you’ll know where.*

He wasn’t being cruel. He was being clear.

He was done being collateral.

And she— She was out of excuses.

But she wasn’t out of anger.

*Elsa.*

The name lit a fuse in her chest.

*You think you're better? You think you can just swoop in and rewrite the ending?*

That girl with her pretty words and righteous fury.

*You don’t know what he and I had. You don’t get to pretend you understand.*

She hated her.

Hated that Elsa got to be the one there when Kazuya broke.

Hated that Elsa didn’t flinch.

And more than anything...

She hated that a part of her feared Elsa might be right.

**The next morning.**

The sky over Okinawa had lost its color. A soft, cold gray washed over the horizon like someone had turned the world down a notch.

Elsa stood by her dorm window, a mug of black coffee untouched beside her. Her reflection was faint in the glass—eyes sharp, posture still, one cheek faintly pink and puffy from last night’s clash.

She hadn’t really slept. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw them: Chizuru’s retreat. Kazuya’s breaking point.

The sting of the slap still lingered on her skin, but it was nothing compared to the fire burning inside her.

She touched the side of her face gently.

*Good. Let it hurt. Let it remind me what I'm fighting for.*

*She thinks she has a claim. That history means ownership. That a few memories make her irreplaceable.*

Elsa exhaled, slow and steady.

*I don't care how long she's loved him. I care about who shows up now.*

*And I will show up every damn day until he doesn't even remember what it felt like to ache for her.*

She hated Chizuru.

Not just for what she did to Kazuya.

But for thinking love was something you could put down and pick back up when convenient.

*You had him. And you walked away. Now it's my turn.*

He doesn’t need someone to rescue him.

He needs someone who *chooses him*. Who *stays*. Who *fights*.

She had waited long enough.

Watched long enough.

Hesitated long enough.

No more.

She turned from the window. Her coffee still steamed.

She didn’t.

Back at the hotel, Chizuru sat at the desk. Her eyes were dry now, but hollow. The left side of her face was still visibly inflamed, the red imprint of everything said and unsaid still etched across her cheek.

The screen of her laptop blinked. The cursor pulsed over a list of obligations: Kyoto. Osaka. Tokyo.

The Nightshade Protocol email sat open. Her manager had followed up twice. She hadn’t replied.

She didn’t need more time. She needed a decision.

She opened a new email. Her fingers didn’t tremble. She typed straight through.

She hit Send.

The decision felt cold. Concrete.

And yet...

If I can make this work... if I can break through just once more...

Maybe I can earn my right to choose.

To build a life where I don’t have to pick between love and ambition.

*Kazuya... please. Just a little longer. Let me catch up.*

**Scene: Group Video Call – December 25, 10:47 PM**  
**Participants:**

* **Reina** – soft-lit room, a piano behind her, wrapped in a knit sweater
* **Naomi** – sleek Tokyo apartment, one knee tucked under her, earbuds in
* **Yuto** – home gym, hoodie clinging to his shoulders, towel around his neck

**Kazuya: Unavailable.**

**Naomi**  
(sips her tea)  
“Still no word from him?”

**Reina**  
(shakes her head, voice low)  
“Not even a lazy ‘Merry Christmas.’ That’s not like him.”

**Yuto**  
(phone resting on bench)  
“Called twice. Straight to voicemail.”

**Naomi**  
(flatly)  
“He skipped morning run too. Strike two.”

**Reina**  
“Think he’s just… unplugging?”

**Yuto**  
(slow breath)  
“When he’s overwhelmed, he shuts down. Always has. But it’s different now. I feel it.”

**Naomi**  
(tilts her head)  
“Three months and he’s ghosting like he’s 43. Impressive consistency.”

**Reina**  
“Naomi…”

**Naomi**  
(gentler)  
“I’m not making fun. I’m worried too. I just cope by teasing.”

**Yuto**  
(grabs water bottle, quieter now)  
“He’s real. That’s the thing. No filters. No games. When someone like that goes silent—it’s not to play hard to get.”

**Reina**  
(quietly)  
“I care. I think… we all do.”

**Yuto**  
(nods)  
“Yeah. Doesn’t matter that it’s just been a semester.”

**Naomi**  
(leans forward)  
“He’s earned his space. Not by trying. Just by… being who he is.”

**Reina**  
(soft smile)  
“I think we should check on him tomorrow. Not barge in. Just… let him know we’re there.”

**Yuto**  
(pulls hoodie up)  
“I’ll drive.”

**Naomi**  
“I’ll prep something practical. Vitamin C, trail bars. No drama.”

**Reina**  
“I’ll bring something warm. And maybe a letter I’ll pretend wasn’t meant for him.”

*They fall quiet.*

Not out of awkwardness.  
Out of understanding.

Because three months wasn’t long.  
But some people don’t need time to leave a mark.  
Some people… just *fit*.

**After the call ended**, Reina didn’t move.

The screen dimmed. The silence in her room grew thicker. The candle on her sill danced faintly against the shadows—its flame steady despite the hush.

*Three months.*

That’s all it took for Kazuya to become someone she couldn’t imagine not checking in on. Not seeing. Not caring for.

He wasn’t blood. Not yet.  
But he mattered.

*Some people enter your life quietly. And still manage to change the shape of it.*

She reached for her journal. Brushed past a pressed flower from a day they’d all gone to the cliffs.

And she wrote:

*You weren’t supposed to matter this much.*

Her phone buzzed softly in her hand.  
She didn’t open it.  
She wasn’t ready to speak.  
Not yet.

But her bag was packed.  
She’d told the others it was “just in case.”

It wasn’t.

She always knew she’d go.

Not to demand answers.  
Not to get closer.  
But to show up—just in case *no one else did*.

She blew out the candle.  
Not for closure.  
Just to keep the light safe—for tomorrow.

**Meanwhile, in a quiet room—**

Kazuya lay still.

Eyes closed. Not asleep. But quiet.  
Not broken. Just… quiet.

The silence wasn’t heavy.  
It wasn’t suffocating.

It was still.  
Balanced.

He reached for his phone.  
Slid the earbuds in.  
And stood.

Then, softly…

He smiled.

*After last night,*  
*he felt free.*

# Chapter 39: Three Christmas Mornings

 ***Chizuru – Christmas Morning***

The hotel room smelled faintly of lavender and exhaustion.

Chizuru sat by the edge of the bed, her thick coat wrapped tightly around her even though the heater hummed softly. Her face ached. Swollen. Throbbing. A cold compress pressed against her cheek, the sting of the slap radiating under the surface like something festering. She switched it out with a fresh one from the mini-fridge. Cold. Numbing. Just enough to stop her from screaming.

She’d pulled her hood down, tied her hair into a low bun, slipped on wide glasses and a disposable mask—layers of armor meant to hide how broken her face had become.

Eyes swollen. Breath short. Dignity nowhere to be found.

She hadn’t slept. Not really. Her phone screen glared at her through puffy lids—blank, no messages. Not that she expected any.

*Of course he didn’t give me his number.*

He had smiled, but it wasn’t the one she remembered. He had spoken gently, but it wasn’t the voice that once trembled just to tell her she looked nice.

She clutched the edge of the duvet, nails biting into fabric.

*I’ve spent years chasing stability. One audition after another, one job at a time, always telling myself—once I make it, then I’ll be allowed to rest. Then I’ll be allowed to love.*

*But I never stopped to ask: at what cost?*

*Kazuya… you were the only thing in my life that was unconditional.*

*And I left you behind to keep chasing something that never loved me back the way you did.*

Now I’m here, holding everything I thought I wanted… and realizing I’d trade half of it just to go back to that rooftop where you first held my hand.

She adjusted the compress. Her skin flinched under the chill, but she didn’t stop.

*Elsa.*

The name sparked fury in her throat like bile.

*That smug, righteous little German witch. Acting like she knows him. Like she has the right.*

*You can have his present, bitch. But his past is mine. And you will never understand what it cost us to survive each other.*

*You think one slap and some pity gives you territory? It doesn’t.*

*But if you want war…* her grip tightened on the compress *I’ll fight you with everything I have.*

Her hand trembled over her phone.

She opened her manager’s thread. Her voice, when she spoke, was hoarse but steady.

""Prioritize the spy movie. I’ll clear my schedule.""

She hung up before they could reply.

Her eyes closed.

She had just watched a love story collapse in her hands.

But maybe… maybe she could still write the ending.

Even if it meant writing it alone.

Even if it meant destroying the woman who stood in her way.

***Kazuya and Elsa – Christmas Morning Shoreline***

The sun had barely crept above the horizon when Kazuya reached the shoreline, breath fogging in front of him, sneakers damp with dew. A quiet jog on Christmas morning wasn’t festive, but it was… simple. Peaceful.

His body moved on rhythm, but his thoughts didn’t. They floated, scattered pieces of last night, of the tank, of her.

And then—

""Morning.""

He turned slightly, mid-stride, just enough to catch the silhouette walking toward him.

""Elsa?"" he asked.

She wore a slate-blue zip hoodie over a black base layer and soft charcoal joggers that brushed her ankles. Her white hair, tied into a high ponytail, swayed behind her. The early light caught her features—softened by delicate makeup, skin powdered just enough to blur the residual swelling beneath her eye.

It still hurt.

But she didn’t care.

She’d layered her concealer with surgical precision. Glossed her lips just enough. Wore a bit of blush to control the narrative.

Because pain or not, Elsa Bayer was going on this run. She was showing up beside him. And she would have this Christmas with him.

This wasn’t just presence. It was territory.

""Didn’t expect to find you out here,"" she said casually, voice light, like the wind hadn’t carried war in it hours ago.

Kazuya offered a half-smile. ""Didn’t expect anyone would.""

""Can I… join you?""

He blinked, then nodded. ""Sure.""

They jogged side by side for a while, the silence not awkward, just unspoken. Comfortable.

""Didn’t peg you for a Christmas runner,"" she said eventually.

Kazuya glanced at her. ""Didn’t peg you for a Christmas stalker.""

She laughed, genuinely. ""Touché.""

They reached the end of the trail and slowed to a walk.

""I was watching romance movies last night,"" Elsa said, her voice breezy. ""Ended up crying.""

Kazuya looked at her sideways. ""You? Crying?""

""Hard to believe?""

""Just… thought you were the ice queen.""

She gasped in mock offense. ""That title’s trademarked.""

Kazuya shrugged. ""Fitting.""

Elsa grinned. ""Cold on the outside, but a gooey caramel center.""

Kazuya laughed. It wasn’t forced. It wasn’t filtered.

It was real.

He hadn’t laughed like that in weeks.

And for a moment, it hung there between them—this strange joy that didn’t demand anything.

They sat near the shore, sneakers half-buried in sand.

""I thought you were busy today,"" he said.

Elsa shrugged. ""My family’s in Sweden. They celebrated last night.""

He nodded.

They looked at the waves together.

""It’s strange,"" Kazuya said, brushing sand off his palm, ""I thought I’d feel worse.""

""About?""

He hesitated. ""Everything.""

Elsa waited. Patient. Still.

""I’m tired,"" he admitted. ""But it’s the kind that feels… okay. Like my bones are heavy, but not in a way that makes me want to disappear. Just… like I’m grounded.""

Elsa’s heart ached at that.

*You’re healing. I can see it. And it’s the most beautiful, heartbreaking thing I’ve ever witnessed.*

They stayed in that silence, listening to waves and birdsong.

Kazuya looked at her again.

""I don’t say it enough, but… thanks. For showing up. For caring.""

Elsa tilted her head. ""You think that’s not obvious?""

He laughed. ""Still. You didn’t have to.""

""I did.""

Their eyes met.

And just as quickly, they looked away.

The moment passed, not awkward, but sacred.

Elsa leaned back on her palms, watching the sea.

*You want to know what this is, Kazuya?* she thought, her jaw tightening. *This is me declaring war. Quietly. Elegantly. This is me marking what’s mine.*

*I’m not the girl who waits anymore.*

*This is the real Elsa Bayer. The conqueror who never lost.*

She turned to him, smiling.

""By the way… I was thinking,"" she said casually. ""You doing anything this afternoon?""

He blinked. ""Today? Uh, no. Not really.""

""Good,"" she said. ""I want to see you again. Two PM. University grounds.""

Kazuya hesitated, caught off guard.

""It’s not a big thing,"" she added smoothly. ""Just you and me. Christmas. Something simple.""

He smiled slowly. ""Okay.""

""Okay,"" she echoed, rising to her feet.

Then she turned, her stride graceful, her expression unreadable.

*Makeup can hide the bruises. But it’s not hiding my intent.*

*I’m going to win him. And this time, I won’t wait for anyone’s permission.*

***The Triad – Separate But Together***

Across Japan, in three different towns and homes, the remaining members of the Quad stirred on Christmas morning.

A video call flickered to life.

**Quad Group Call: Christmas Mission 🎄**

Naomi appeared first, camera steady from her kitchen counter. She wore a crisp navy hoodie, hair in a sharp ponytail, one hand juggling her squirming baby niece, the other nursing a half-empty mug of black coffee. Her expression was focused, exact.

""Roll call. Reina, you're late,"" she said, voice clipped but not unkind.

""I'M HERE!"" Reina’s voice burst through as her camera popped on. She was in glittery pajamas and fuzzy red socks, clutching a mug of cocoa. Behind her, fairy lights blinked like she lived inside a snow globe. ""Ugh, Naomi, I was wrapping gifts for my goddaughter! It's Christmas! Can’t a girl sparkle in peace?""

Naomi raised a brow. ""You sparkle before sunrise? That explains a lot.""

""You’re just jealous of my aesthetic.""

Yuto joined with a soft chuckle, camera tilted from the stovetop. He was shirtless under a hoodie, flipping bacon while his little brother reached for the plate like a gremlin. ""Tell Reina to ship those socks. I’ll trade you bacon.""

Reina squinted. ""You bribing me with pork products now?""

""His love language is meat,"" Naomi deadpanned.

""And caffeine,"" Yuto added.

""Speaking of—progress report,"" Naomi said, shifting the baby to her hip like it was nothing. ""Mission: Save Kazuya.""

Reina set down her mug. ""No texts from him yet?""

Yuto shook his head. ""Nada. He’s deep in one of those ocean boy silences.""

Reina sighed. ""He’s so poetic when he’s in pain.""

Naomi gave her a look. ""Don’t romanticize emotional repression.""

""Not romanticizing, just... appreciating.""

""Focus, artist girl,"" Naomi warned, adjusting the camera. ""What’s the status?""

""I did an early grocery run. I’m baking the cake,"" Reina beamed. ""Chocolate, with orange zest. Inspired.""

""I’ll bring cookies,"" Naomi said. ""Yes, store-bought. Don’t judge.""

Yuto grunted. ""Brave.""

""Braver than you, vending machine boy,"" Naomi shot back.

""Quality vending,"" Yuto replied with a smirk.

They all laughed.

Reina straightened, her tone softening. ""Tomorrow. 5PM. University grounds. Right?""

Naomi nodded. ""Locked in.""

Yuto glanced off-screen, then back. ""He won’t be expecting it. That’s good.""

They all looked for a second at the empty fourth square on the screen.

Reina whispered, more to herself than the group, ""He’s not alone this year. He just doesn’t know it yet.""

Naomi gave her a long look, then added, ""And we’re not letting him forget it.""

Yuto flipped the last of the bacon onto a plate. ""Let’s give him something solid to hold on to.""

And across three towns, with cocoa, bacon, and soft winter light, the Quad made a promise without saying the words:

They were going to save their brother.

Tomorrow.

**Later that morning – Reina’s Room**

The call had ended, but Reina stayed curled up on the couch, the glow of the screen still faint on her cheek.

She pulled her legs to her chest and stared at the tree lights reflecting softly in the window. A lump sat in her throat.

*Kazuya, wherever you are... I hope you're warm. I hope you're not alone.*

She reached for the notebook tucked under a stack of sheet music. It was old—soft leather, worn at the edges, with gold ink faded from touch.

She opened it and uncapped a pen.

Her hand moved slowly, deliberately.

**Unsent Verse**  
*If you’re out there in the quiet,*  
*With your name wrapped in the dark,*  
*Know this girl still sings beside you,*  
*Even if we’re worlds apart.*

Her hand trembled slightly. Not with sadness. With the weight of everything unspoken.

She rested the pen against the spine of the journal and whispered:

""I don’t need to be the choice, Kazuya. But let me be the verse you remember.""

Then she closed the notebook.

And let the silence hold her, just for a little while.

# Chapter 40: “Here We Go Again”

Christmas morning broke over Okinawa with a hush.

The light was soft. The breeze gentle. But in one dormitory, the stillness had weight.

Elsa Bayer stood at her window, the glass cool beneath her fingertips. Outside, the campus was quiet, draped in golden morning light. But her reflection in the glass showed only one thing:

A girl with something to prove.

A girl with a bruised cheek.

But also—a girl with a plan.

Yesterday, she had asked him.

*Let me take you out,* she said. *2 PM. Christmas. University grounds.*

And Kazuya—hesitant, stunned, maybe even a little unsure—had smiled.

*Okay,* he said.

Not a maybe. Not a delay.

He said yes.

And now, she would make sure he remembered this day for the rest of his life.

She turned from the window and reached for her phone, fingers flying across the screen.

**Merry Christmas, Mom. Dad. I forgot to send earlier.Heading to lunch now...**

She hesitated, then added:

**With someone.**

Her thumb hovered, then she opened another chat window.

**Elsa:** Do you know the fastest way to reduce swelling on the face? From a slap.  
**Elsa:** Don’t tell Papa.

Three dots appeared. Then the screen lit up.

**Incoming Call: Mom**

Elsa sighed and declined.

A storm of texts followed.

**Mom:** What happened?  
**Mom:** Are you safe?  
**Mom:** Did someone hurt you? Why wouldn’t you call?

Elsa responded calmly.

**Elsa:** I'm okay. I got in a fight. I defended someone I love. I was slapped. I slapped back. It’s over.

Another pause. Then:

**Mom:** Cold chamomile compress. Twice. Ten minutes each. Then rosewater toner. Use your Hokkaido stick with the green tint.  
**Mom:** And I won’t tell your father. But only if you promise me one thing:

**Mom:** Win.

Elsa smiled faintly.

**Elsa:** I plan to.

**Mom:** Good. Dazzle him. Leave a mark.

Elsa tossed the phone onto her bed and pivoted into motion.

She opened drawers. Unlocked cases. Spread her beauty arsenal across the floor.

German serums, French essence mists, Milanese color palettes. Japanese silk concealer with SPF. She arranged them like ritual tools.

Today wasn’t just about beauty.  
It was about memory.

She applied the chamomile compress to her cheek while the bath ran.

Then fragrances: bergamot, white amber, neroli. She let it linger behind her ears, wrists, collarbone. Not to overwhelm. Just to haunt.

The outfit came next.

Cream belted coat. Pale rose scarf. Simple cashmere gloves. She wore elegance like a blade in velvet.

*He’d never seen her like this. And he would never forget it.*

She sat on the edge of her bed, phone in hand.  
Typed:

**Dress well today. It’s a date.**

Paused.

Deleted it.

*If he’s meant to see me, he’ll know.*

She rose. Steam filled the room as she stepped toward the bath.

Elsa Bayer, war-painted in restraint and rosewater, smiled to herself.

*Let the battle begin.*

Back in his room, Kazuya was pacing.

The air was still, but inside him, everything felt jagged.

He stared at his open closet, fingers combing through his hair as he whispered, more to himself than to the room:

""Is this a date?""

He paused. Then again:

""Isn’t it?""

He didn’t know.

All he knew was that she had asked. She had looked him in the eyes and invited him.

*2 PM. Christmas. University grounds.*

And he said yes.

He didn’t even think. The words just... slipped out. *Okay.*

He told himself it didn’t mean anything.

But that wasn’t true.

He crossed the room, then stopped, pressing a palm over his chest. His heart was thudding. Unsteady. Real.

*Why did I say yes?* he thought. *Why now?*

He closed his eyes.

And like filmstrips, the memories flooded in.

Elsa’s laughter after teasing him at the shore during their midnight talks. The way she scolded him gently and secretly for not hydrating after surfing, as they pass in the hallway after class. The look in her eyes last night—not pity, not concern. Just... presence.

She had stood her ground for him, while he bared his soul to her.

*This isn’t just a date,* he thought, chest tightening. *This might be an answer.*

He turned back to the closet, determination flickering in his eyes.

If she was showing up as herself—all of herself—then he would do the same.

He pulled out his best option for the Okinawan breeze: a light linen shirt, slightly unbuttoned at the collar, paired with fitted earth-toned chinos. Over that, a tan bomber jacket with soft lining. Comfortable. Clean. Undeniably him.

His hair was pulled into a messy yet elegant bun, the sun-kissed orange tips catching the light.

He added a simple string of beaded accessories—ones he picked up from a local artisan months ago. Not loud. Just meaningful.

When he finally stood in front of the mirror, something in him steadied.

No flinching.

No overthinking.

Just breath.

He met his reflection.

And whispered:

""Let’s find out what this really is.""

And with that, he picked up his phone. Checked the time.

1:42 PM.

*Time to go.*

By the time Kazuya reached the university gates, it had been forty-five minutes. Then an hour. Then an hour and a half.

He leaned against the old courtyard pillar, hands in his pockets, heart steady but strangely alert. Elsa had messaged.

**10 more minutes.**

Then again.

**Almost there.**

But he wasn’t annoyed. Wasn’t even restless.

He was just... waiting.

Not for time to pass. But for *her*.

And then—

The air shifted.

The sound of boots on stone cut through the breeze. A shadow swept over the steps.

And when he looked up—

The world stopped.

Elsa Bayer stood at the top of the stairs, sunlight weaving through her snow-white hair, which fell in soft waves past her shoulders. Her dress, a deep jewel-toned silk that clung and flowed all at once, shimmered with each step. A tailored cream trench coat floated behind her like the wings of something divine. She wore ankle boots that kissed the pavement without a sound. Minimal jewelry. A whisper of perfume.

She didn’t descend—she *claimed* the steps.

Kazuya felt something lurch in his chest.

And then again, when she reached him.

She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t apologize.

She hooked her arm around his, leaned in, and said, with quiet finality:

""This *is* a date. And I’m not sorry for making it one.""

Kazuya opened his mouth. Then closed it.

He swallowed.

""You’re beautiful,"" he murmured before he could stop himself. ""Even more than Chizuru.""

Elsa froze for a heartbeat. Then smiled.

She didn’t need to reply.

But her chest swelled. Her eyes gleamed.

*Say that again,* she thought. *Say it louder. I dare you.*

They walked side by side toward the quiet café tucked off the main road, her arm still slung through his, her body leaning closer than necessary.

Elsa didn’t care who saw them. Professors, classmates, strangers—they could all look. She wanted them to. She walked like she was parading a victory, like she was telling the world: *He’s mine now.*

She hummed softly—snatches of Christmas songs under her breath, light and melodic.

*I didn’t come here to play fair,* she thought. *I came here to win.*

*Let her see us. Let them all see.*

She could still feel the ghost of Chizuru's slap from the night before. Still feel the sting in her jaw, the burn on her cheekbone. But it didn’t matter.

*This warmth on my arm is real. This moment is mine.*

*She had him. She gave him up. And now?*

*Now, I’ll fight tooth and nail to keep him.*

Kazuya felt the weight of her presence with every step. The warmth of her touch. The unapologetic way she leaned into him, laughed at his comments, pointed at street decorations with the glee of someone who didn’t need permission to enjoy things.

He didn’t know how to process it. This wasn’t something he was used to—a woman so far out of his league clinging to him like he was the prize.

It warmed his chest.

And scared him just a little.

*Why did I say that?* he wondered. *That she’s more beautiful than Chizuru?*

But even now, walking with her like this—it didn’t feel like a mistake. It didn’t feel like confusion.

It felt like clarity knocking on the door of his ribs.

*She’s proud to be seen with me.* *She’s not hiding.* *She’s not pretending.*

And maybe... maybe he deserved to be looked at that way.

And when the small café finally appeared—all glass and ivy and hanging lanterns—Elsa gave his arm a squeeze and smiled.

""Ready?"" she asked.

He nodded.

She pushed open the door.

And together, they stepped inside.

Across the street, a black car slowed at the intersection.

Inside, Chizuru Mizuhara sat in silence. Her arms wrapped tightly around her body, her sunglasses large enough to hide most of her swollen features from the night before. But not enough to contain the storm churning in her chest.

She hadn’t meant to pass by. But fate, cruel and calculated, had other plans.

And there they were.

Kazuya. With *her*.

Elsa was radiant—draped in silk, smiling like she owned the street, clinging to Kazuya as though the world had dared her to.

And Kazuya… wasn’t resisting. Wasn’t flinching. Wasn’t even looking around for the girl who used to be his entire world.

He was laughing.

*That laugh was mine.*

Chizuru's hand trembled on her lap. Her jaw locked, her breath sharp and uneven. She wanted to move. Open the door. March across the street and tear that picture apart with her bare hands.

*Who the hell does she think she is? Walking with him like that? Holding him like that? Flaunting him like a trophy she earned?*

Her fingers inched toward the handle.

*Stop them.*

*Pull him away. Remind him who you are.*

But she didn’t.

Because deep inside, a harsher truth echoed:

*You left.* *You waited.* *You hesitated.*

And Elsa didn’t.

She acted.

And now, she was winning.

Tears pricked the corner of Chizuru’s eyes, but she blinked them back. Her body burned with the ache of helplessness, of fury, of *loss*. The kind of loss you see happening in real-time and still can’t stop.

*She’s not just in love. She’s at war.* *And I’m the enemy she already wounded.*

The café door swung open.

Elsa stepped inside, still clinging to him.

Chizuru watched as Kazuya held it open for her, smiling.

But beneath the rage, something else stirred. Something deeper. Clearer.

*I understand now.* *My dream—acting, success, fame—they were never the end. They were just the road.* *And the truth is, I know where that road is supposed to lead. Back to him.* *But I can’t chase him blindly.* *I need to rise. Not just to be seen, but to be worthy—not in his eyes, but in mine.* *I can have both. I know that now.* *But if I want a future with Kazuya… I need to move. Fast. With purpose.* *Before the story finishes without me.*

*He used to do that for me.*

Her heart twisted, not just from grief—but from rage. At herself. At Elsa. At the entire cruel sequence of choices that led her here.

And still—she didn’t move.

The car pulled away.

And he never looked up.

Too busy laughing. Too busy *living.*

And as they disappeared inside, Chizuru let a single tear fall under her glasses.

Not from heartbreak.

But from the realization:

*If I don’t fight for him now, there won’t be a story left to finish.*

1m25965,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1m25965/adhd_and_shopping/,ADHD and shopping,"Recently I’ve noticed that I have a shopping addiction/spending money problem. I knew but never fully admitted it to myself. I’ve worked since I was 17 and have barely anything to show for it due to my impulsive habits. 

My family grew up very impulsive with money and going to the mall was something to do even if you didn’t have the money to do so. 

A couple years ago I put myself on strict no buys for makeup and clothing and barely buy myself new backpacks or purses outside of special occasions. But my spending problem overflows into areas of grocery and especially caffeine spending. I recently have started adhd meds, a very low dose because my doctor was reluctant to prescribe despite presenting with high symptoms. So I’ve been coping for years through university and working with ridiculous amounts of caffeine. Which cost a lot of money because I’m picky and impulsive,  such as if I walk by a coffee shop. 

But now on top of the adhd concerns and the fact that I’m already a huge inconvenience to my partner because I struggle so deeply with household tasks. I also have a spending problem. This whole adhd shopping addiction feels like such a wild feedback loop where I constantly am broke and stressed out about money on top of being a shitty adult.

Apologies for the long af TL;DR 🫣 also I’m not sure in the measurements besides that one wall in my room is def 13’ 


*BACKGROUND*
So I (33F) just moved my older sister (37F) Anne to live with me about 1.5 months ago Anne has had some crazy physical health issues most of our life (including being hospitalized for not being able to stop puking when she’s having a really bad time), and it’s bc of this, as well as both of our self-imposed distance from the rest of our family (normalized some pretty fkd up stuff, I’m a mom; don’t want my son (5) to think that ish is okay; she has her own reasons.), that I decided to move her here. She has worked in the past though part of why she supposedly wanted to come here is bc she wanted to apply for disability but lived in a 420-illegal state and occasionally used it to help with nausea and to stop a vomiting spell before it got to the point that it would require hospitalization. 

I spent around $1200 to get her here, rushed bc supposedly her living situation was going south (staying with an ex who was supposedly at the time “just friends” idk if it’s true or not but sometimes I’ve felt, based on things she’s says vs timelines where I was under the impression they weren’t talking, plus how weird she gets about even letting me help her update something on cashapp even though I’ve never gone through her phone or belongings.. sorry for the rant—I’ll organize when I’m done writing but I’m trying to be as transparent as possible bc I’m not really sure what to do/if I’m being unreasonable/an ahole)

Anyways, I’ve tried sooo hard to be accommodating, going out of my way to get things for her/her dog that would be helpful, like a like plexiglass/acrylic dog kennel/gate thing before she got here, a freestanding closet plus a z bar with wheels for her clothes bc she was going to turn the closetless living room into her room (which previously had my art supplies for my business in one corner, but nothing else bc the plan has been to move her here since I moved in in February). I had just planned on having my supplies organized in the new “living room” (aka part of the dining room area that’s hmm I think at least 12’x15’? So enough for a small round dining table and another sitting area/designated space since we use floor cushions instead of a traditional couch), but my sister insisted that my art supplies be organized into my much smaller room ((~13x10?) meanwhile her room is literally the biggest room in the house (~15’x15’), but doesn’t have an actual door, just a pretty wide doorway), which really wasn’t my plan, but we went back and forth and basically she made the “point” that she was going to be keeping her art supplies in her room (my things are for a business that can host up to 45-50 painters, incl aprons, brushes, easels, paints etc). 

I’ve got one closet in my room but I’ve made that the “litter box room” sacrificing my clothes storage so that the cat box is not in common space, which I did agree to/suggest, but that was BEFORE i was also basically told that my art supplies couldn’t be in the common area (even if organized well and in a visually-appealing way), so now I’m expected to fit all of my biz supplies besides my paints, a queen bed, a (makeshift) desk (reg won’t fit), rotating bookcase, shoe rack, and nightstand in my room with the litterbox in the closet. I have been trying to find a solid configuration for weeks and kinda getting there but honestly I’m not sure how it’s going to all fit AND me be able to be in there..I haven’t even tried to put my clothes in there yet 🤦‍♀️ they’re in bins in the corner of my son’s room. 

*THE ISSUE(S)*
So I’ve let the things slide with the common areas bc I DO want her to feel like the apt is hers to be in/that she doesn’t have to just exist in her room, but still she keeps everything in her room (tbh like I’m going to take her stuff..) even though, for example I got a tension-supported corner rod with little shelves that she suggested (but i guess it’s just so she can keep the side of tub clear when she’s not feeling well, and needing to be in the shower), plus a little caddy that hangs from the shower that she explicitly asked me to get, but she keeps only a handled scrub brush on it. She gave some (imo) lame excuse about moving her shampoo/conditioner back and forth bc it helps her remember of she did/didnt wash her hair? Felt like clear bs to me at the time, but idgaf where she keeps it, so I just internally shrugged it off). I’ve gotten blackout curtains for her doorway, but she hasn’t used them, refused them, instead hanging two blankets from a curtain rod instead, but continues to complain about the lights, going as far as telling me that me and my son are not going to be able to use any of the kitchen/back hall lights (her room is in the front), and we’ll just have to use the laundry/bathroom lights bc it keeps waking her up. 

We’ve been dealing with a pest issue that is apparently in the upstairs unit and that I absolutely don’t want trying to come down here and I’ve repeatedly asked her to cover/put up her dogs food when either she’s not in the room or overnight esp, bc her dog has a habit of laying food pieces out all over the floor. She used to do this when she was staying in a friends barn and it was bringing in ants that she didn’t want, but I guess bc she hasn’t seen anything personally eating it here she isn’t concerned? It’s esp knowing that she DID make the effort before when it ONLY affected her but not “wanting to” have to keep bending down to put the lid on/off the food (her own words), citing her bad back as the reason why it’s so stressful/difficult to do consistently. 

She’s also been complaining that my cat is apparently going into her room and eating all the dog food (absolutely sounds like something he would do—he has 0 gaf when it comes to him getting to food—he has to be on an automatic feeder haha), but I’ve suggested numerous times both that she try again covering the food when she isn’t in the room (she’s told me before her dog doesn’t really eat unless she’s in the room anyways), that she try putting the food a little higher up so it’s off the ground (less accessible to pests AND less distance to bend to cover it), and that she actually use the kennel either to keep her dogs stuff out of reach of the cat or as a less penetrable blockade for the doorway (tbh I’m not even sure how it works anymore bc it’s remained in the box the entire time, but it would help with some if not all of the dog-food -related issues. Instead, Anne insists that I close my cat up in my room whenever she decides to go sit on the back porch (for hours and hours every single day). I don’t think this is fair.. she had me have Meeko (my cat) locked up for the first 3-4 days they were here and it was only because I insisted that she had initially said ONE maybe TWO days that he was going to be coming out (she wasn’t prioritizing getting the dog and cat acquainted but insisted she was worried my cat (fixed) would mark if they weren’t properly introduced/acclimated to each other beforehand)

So she’s also made a whole thing about noise with the upstairs neighbors (which ofc caused them to retaliate by being more petty) which has actually cause issues in my sons sleep schedule (sensory issues), I went to court to try to get a harassment order, spent the whole day there then she had the nerve to complain about having to watch my son as if that was how I wanted to spend my entire day that day when I asked was behind on everything else.. to be fair, she did watch him while I was at my part time job and some while I hung out with my neighbor after work for a couple hours, but I literally never get a break since summer started bc I haven’t gotten him into a daycare yet (and work mostly from home for my business). 

Anyways, I’ve gotten several Bluetooth speakers that can pair together to do white noise and offered her one since it’s louder than the one she has, but like everything else she could use that’s been offered to her, she refused it but has previously complained INSISTING one time when my son and I were sitting at the dining table at like 11am that my son had been SHRIEKING prior to the one little happy sound he made while playing at the table. I told her well I’ve been sitting here with him the whole time and he hasn’t been making any sound hardly at all and definitely not shrieking sounds. She got angry and insisted that she said something like “that’s enough!” And that it sounded like he ran down the back hall still shrieking, telling me that basically my conscious recollection of events was more fallible than her awareness of what was happening around her while she was asleep…i insisted that he had not been making those noises and she got loud and started getting angry at me, so I pulled up a security camera and heard a siren sounding at one point that did in fact recede into the distance, I tried mentioning this to her and she didn’t want to hear it. I tried bringing it up later and she basically acted like she wasn’t really buying it but I told her that in principle I’m going to defend my son if he didn’t do anything wrong (because she had scolded him so fiercely and unexpectedly that both he and I jumped in our seats). 

Then night before last around 3/3:30am, I was sitting in the kitchen with my laptop and Bluetooth headphones, having been woken by the neighbors upstairs again. About 30 min into my movie, I decided to make myself a bowl of cereal which I ate pretty quickly (soggy cereal is the fkn WORST blegh and this was honey bunches of oats and the flakes get soggy faster than others imo). While finishing drinking my milk, Anne comes out and tells me that I’m gonna have to organize my room the next day (which was already designated to therapy appointments and other appointments outside of the house, which I had to be up before 8am to leave for), and that I’m just going to have to stay in my room at night…bc I’ve “been keeping [her] up all night long” to which I pulled up the time on the movie (0:42:xx) and told her I might have been up 45 min, to which she changed her stance revising to say that the neighbors had been keeping her up but she’d heard me clanking clinking which is why she got up…but my cereal couldn’t have taken more than 10/15 min to eat 

Further I’m the only person paying rent, utilities, groceries, disposables, etc. she was supposed to update just two documents so she could apply for Medicaid/food stamps, but despite me mentioning it repeatedly she still hasn’t, so she’s straight up straining resources that were already thin been just me and my son, but on top of that she has specific stuff she insists she can/cannot eat, so it’s not like I just increase quantities of things we are already getting (though she’s seemed to eat plenty of things she “can’t” seemingly fine when it’s been more convenient than making something herself, like pizza which she swore she couldn’t eat but has eaten (without regard whatsoever for the brand) idek at least 20 times probably since she’s been here the last week in May—my son only eats a few things and cheese pizza is one)

I paid her $200 recently for helping with my son when I’ve worked my PT/working an event so that she could get yk toiletries or a coffee here and there (I’ve been also trying to be mindful of that and surprising with stuff when I can but I’m by NO MEANS doing great or honestly even okay financially, esp after moving her here and spending more than planned to do so which meant I DIDN’T pay down my credit card like I had wanted to, and still can’t bc now I’m paying for me, my son, AND my sister who was supposed to be helping in SOME way (even if it’s covering her own food with food stamps so I don’t have to take from me and my son to meet her special needs for food). 

I didn’t mind, but also it’s like everything that I’ve done to try and be mindful and accommodating is just like…idk expected? But if I try to address anything that is bothering me she refuses to listen and then says she considers it “resolved”. With the most recent thing I tried to bring it up the next day after taking some time and she tried to make it like I’m saying it’s unreasonable for her to be able to sleep through the night and wouldn’t even let me get in that it’s perfectly reasonable not that SHE needs to be MORE PROACTIVE about things she’s complaining about. She accused me of being a narcissist? Even though I’m just insisting that I’m not going to be “confined” to my room every night just because she goes to bed. I offered her both my room and my son’s rooms which have doors and are in less noisy parts of the apt but she says they were too small for her and all her stuff…. Sooooo she chose the room with no door, insists on remaining in it, doesn’t use any of the things I got specifically so that it’s more private/less easily disturbed, but wants literally everyone else in the apartment and honestly the unit above to conform to what she wants with her doing little to nothing. She keeps citing that she gets sick that of she doesn’t sleep she’ll get sick but it’s like…I’ve got PTSD and insomnia, and has a car accident last year that still is affecting my memory (which is why when she insisted my son has been shrieking it really kinda ticked me off—bc I was legit questioning my memory and it was only bc of the security footage that I was able to know that I hadn’t just forgotten him carrying on like that), I’m also the only person working and also dealing with a court issue with the property managers from when they refused to treat the unit for issues coming from the upstairs unit, only person advocating for my son while he’s in therapy and trying to figure out the best place for him to go to school, trying to handle my own mental health stuff (and she knows when I can’t sleep I usually get up and watch a movie or take a bath, and so many times I’ve just got to stop what I’m doing even if I just ran the tub for myself and get out/let her have it bc she’s getting sick or doesn’t feel good but like where tf is the gd line?! Bc I feel like I’ve been nothing but fkn accommodating and then she yells at me and calls ME a narcissist or that I’m using narcissist tactics? When I tell her that she’s being ridiculous in her expectations without really doing anything within her own power to help the issues…am I nuts or SHE’S being an asshole?! 

Thank you if you made it this far—I really need to schedule with my therapist, but have been juggling so much, including extra stuff which you don’t think about like having to take the trash out more bc she always takes it out the bin and sits it by the front door like that’s fkn doing anything…then I’m supposed to just take it outside even though I have explicitly mentioned how I get ptsd anxiety from taking the trash (specific trigger, ikkkk ughhh fml), and now there is even more to be taken but I’m STILL the only one taking it, plus having to do all the grocery shopping and her even refusing to input the gd DoorDash grocery orders which she CAN fkn do and save me some time but can’t fkn figure out why I’m annoyed. 

I’m really having a hard time seeing how this is going to work rn moving forward bc  she’s not contributing anything besides childcare 2-3 times a week (12hrs max), adding to the things I have to do, adding to the things I have to buy, not handling things she is perfectly capable of handling and all on the basis of her being sick/in pain all the time but not even taking the fkn FIRST steps in almost TWO MONTHS to get herself on Medicaid/SSI/Food Stamps and expecting me to just do everything. Jesus reading this back is pissing me off. Like am I an ahole bc she has medical stuff? She’s puked 2 times that I’ve seen since she’s been here (bit to be fair so have I that many from MY anxiety stuff so like…idk), and any time I try to mention any of my very real (lawyers involved) medical stuff she’s just dismissive of it—saying “I GET IT” a lot while also saying the opposite of what I’m trying to say so I’m just getting really frustrated and I really truly love my sister and 87% of the time we get along great but I haven’t lived with her since we were kids and am kinda starting to see why she’s never friends with anyone she lives with after she lives with them… I’m at a loss for how to approach this and am getting really financially fkd in the process. She’s made it clear she’ll “figure something out if [she] has to” the first time she was annoyed with the upstairs neighbors making noise late. Despite me spending almost everything I had to get her here as far as possible bc she insisted that her ex was getting weird/crazy on her…now I’m kinda feeling manipulated. Help?

So I’ve let the things slide with the common areas bc I DO want her to feel like the apt is hers to be in/that she doesn’t have to just exist in her room, but still she keeps everything in her room (tbh like I’m going to take her stuff..) even though, for example I got a tension-supported corner rod with little shelves that she suggested (but i guess it’s just so she can keep the side of tub clear when she’s not feeling well, and needing to be in the shower), plus a little caddy that hangs from the shower that she explicitly asked me to get, but she keeps only a handled scrub brush on it. She gave some (imo) lame excuse about moving her shampoo/conditioner back and forth bc it helps her remember of she did/didnt wash her hair? Felt like clear bs to me at the time, but idgaf where she keeps it, so I just internally shrugged it off). I’ve gotten blackout curtains for her doorway, but she hasn’t used them, refused them, instead hanging two blankets from a curtain rod instead, but continues to complain about the lights, going as far as telling me that me and my son are not going to be able to use any of the kitchen/back hall lights (her room is in the front), and we’ll just have to use the laundry/bathroom lights bc it keeps waking her up. 

We’ve been dealing with a pest issue that is apparently in the upstairs unit and that I absolutely don’t want trying to come down here and I’ve repeatedly asked her to cover/put up her dogs food when either she’s not in the room or overnight esp, bc her dog has a habit of laying food pieces out all over the floor. She used to do this when she was staying in a friends barn and it was bringing in ants that she didn’t want, but I guess bc she hasn’t seen anything personally eating it here she isn’t concerned? It’s esp knowing that she DID make the effort before when it ONLY affected her but not “wanting to” have to keep bending down to put the lid on/off the food (her own words), citing her bad back as the reason why it’s so stressful/difficult to do consistently. 

She’s also been complaining that my cat is apparently going into her room and eating all the dog food (absolutely sounds like something he would do—he has 0 gaf when it comes to him getting to food—he has to be on an automatic feeder haha), but I’ve suggested numerous times both that she try again covering the food when she isn’t in the room (she’s told me before her dog doesn’t really eat unless she’s in the room anyways), that she try putting the food a little higher up so it’s off the ground (less accessible to pests AND less distance to bend to cover it), and that she actually use the kennel either to keep her dogs stuff out of reach of the cat or as a less penetrable blockade for the doorway (tbh I’m not even sure how it works anymore bc it’s remained in the box the entire time, but it would help with some if not all of the dog-food -related issues. Instead, Anne insists that I close my cat up in my room whenever she decides to go sit on the back porch (for hours and hours every single day). I don’t think this is fair.. she had me have Meeko (my cat) locked up for the first 3-4 days they were here and it was only because I insisted that she had initially said ONE maybe TWO days that he was going to be coming out (she wasn’t prioritizing getting the dog and cat acquainted but insisted she was worried my cat (fixed) would mark if they weren’t properly introduced/acclimated to each other beforehand)

So she’s also made a whole thing about noise with the upstairs neighbors (which ofc caused them to retaliate by being more petty) which has actually cause issues in my sons sleep schedule (sensory issues), I went to court to try to get a harassment order, spent the whole day there then she had the nerve to complain about having to watch my son as if that was how I wanted to spend my entire day that day when I asked was behind on everything else.. to be fair, she did watch him while I was at my part time job and some while I hung out with my neighbor after work for a couple hours, but I literally never get a break since summer started bc I haven’t gotten him into a daycare yet (and work mostly from home for my business). 

Anyways, I’ve gotten several Bluetooth speakers that can pair together to do white noise and offered her one since it’s louder than the one she has, but like everything else she could use that’s been offered to her, she refused it but has previously complained INSISTING one time when my son and I were sitting at the dining table at like 11am that my son had been SHRIEKING prior to the one little happy sound he made while playing at the table. I told her well I’ve been sitting here with him the whole time and he hasn’t been making any sound hardly at all and definitely not shrieking sounds. She got angry and insisted that she said something like “that’s enough!” And that it sounded like he ran down the back hall still shrieking, telling me that basically my conscious recollection of events was more fallible than her awareness of what was happening around her while she was asleep…i insisted that he had not been making those noises and she got loud and started getting angry at me, so I pulled up a security camera and heard a siren sounding at one point that did in fact recede into the distance, I tried mentioning this to her and she didn’t want to hear it. I tried bringing it up later and she basically acted like she wasn’t really buying it but I told her that in principle I’m going to defend my son if he didn’t do anything wrong (because she had scolded him so fiercely and unexpectedly that both he and I jumped in our seats). 

Then night before last around 3/3:30am, I was sitting in the kitchen with my laptop and Bluetooth headphones, having been woken by the neighbors upstairs again. About 30 min into my movie, I decided to make myself a bowl of cereal which I ate pretty quickly (soggy cereal is the fkn WORST blegh and this was honey bunches of oats and the flakes get soggy faster than others imo). While finishing drinking my milk, Anne comes out and tells me that I’m gonna have to organize my room the next day (which was already designated to therapy appointments and other appointments outside of the house, which I had to be up before 8am to leave for), and that I’m just going to have to stay in my room at night…bc I’ve “been keeping [her] up all night long” to which I pulled up the time on the movie (0:42:xx) and told her I might have been up 45 min, to which she changed her stance revising to say that the neighbors had been keeping her up but she’d heard me clanking clinking which is why she got up…but my cereal couldn’t have taken more than 10/15 min to eat 

Further I’m the only person paying rent, utilities, groceries, disposables, etc. she was supposed to update just two documents so she could apply for Medicaid/food stamps, but despite me mentioning it repeatedly she still hasn’t, so she’s straight up straining resources that were already thin been just me and my son, but on top of that she has specific stuff she insists she can/cannot eat, so it’s not like I just increase quantities of things we are already getting (though she’s seemed to eat plenty of things she “can’t” seemingly fine when it’s been more convenient than making something herself, like pizza which she swore she couldn’t eat but has eaten (without regard whatsoever for the brand) idek at least 20 times probably since she’s been here the last week in May—my son only eats a few things and cheese pizza is one)

I paid her $200 recently for helping with my son when I’ve worked my PT/working an event so that she could get yk toiletries or a coffee here and there (I’ve been also trying to be mindful of that and surprising with stuff when I can but I’m by NO MEANS doing great or honestly even okay financially, esp after moving her here and spending more than planned to do so which meant I DIDN’T pay down my credit card like I had wanted to, and still can’t bc now I’m paying for me, my son, AND my sister who was supposed to be helping in SOME way (even if it’s covering her own food with food stamps so I don’t have to take from me and my son to meet her special needs for food). 

I didn’t mind, but also it’s like everything that I’ve done to try and be mindful and accommodating is just like…idk expected? But if I try to address anything that is bothering me she refuses to listen and then says she considers it “resolved”. With the most recent thing I tried to bring it up the next day after taking some time and she tried to make it like I’m saying it’s unreasonable for her to be able to sleep through the night and wouldn’t even let me get in that it’s perfectly reasonable not that SHE needs to be MORE PROACTIVE about things she’s complaining about. She accused me of being a narcissist? Even though I’m just insisting that I’m not going to be “confined” to my room every night just because she goes to bed. I offered her both my room and my son’s rooms which have doors and are in less noisy parts of the apt but she says they were too small for her and all her stuff…. Sooooo she chose the room with no door, insists on remaining in it, doesn’t use any of the things I got specifically so that it’s more private/less easily disturbed, but wants literally everyone else in the apartment and honestly the unit above to conform to what she wants with her doing little to nothing. She keeps citing that she gets sick that of she doesn’t sleep she’ll get sick but it’s like…I’ve got PTSD and insomnia, and has a car accident last year that still is affecting my memory (which is why when she insisted my son has been shrieking it really kinda ticked me off—bc I was legit questioning my memory and it was only bc of the security footage that I was able to know that I hadn’t just forgotten him carrying on like that), I’m also the only person working and also dealing with a court issue with the property managers from when they refused to treat the unit for issues coming from the upstairs unit, only person advocating for my son while he’s in therapy and trying to figure out the best place for him to go to school, trying to handle my own mental health stuff (and she knows when I can’t sleep I usually get up and watch a movie or take a bath, and so many times I’ve just got to stop what I’m doing even if I just ran the tub for myself and get out/let her have it bc she’s getting sick or doesn’t feel good but like where tf is the gd line?! Bc I feel like I’ve been nothing but fkn accommodating and then she yells at me and calls ME a narcissist or that I’m using narcissist tactics? When I tell her that she’s being ridiculous in her expectations without really doing anything within her own power to help the issues…am I nuts or SHE’S being an asshole?! 

Thank you if you made it this far—I really need to schedule with my therapist, but have been juggling so much, including extra stuff which you don’t think about like having to take the trash out more bc she always takes it out the bin and sits it by the front door like that’s fkn doing anything…then I’m supposed to just take it outside even though I have explicitly mentioned how I get ptsd anxiety from taking the trash (specific trigger, ikkkk ughhh fml), and now there is even more to be taken but I’m STILL the only one taking it, plus having to do all the grocery shopping and her even refusing to input the gd DoorDash grocery orders which she CAN fkn do and save me some time but can’t fkn figure out why I’m annoyed. 

I’m really having a hard time seeing how this is going to work rn moving forward bc  she’s not contributing anything besides childcare 2-3 times a week (12hrs max), adding to the things I have to do, adding to the things I have to buy, not handling things she is perfectly capable of handling and all on the basis of her being sick/in pain all the time but not even taking the fkn FIRST steps in almost TWO MONTHS to get herself on Medicaid/SSI/Food Stamps and expecting me to just do everything. Jesus reading this back is pissing me off. Like am I an ahole bc she has medical stuff? She’s puked 2 times that I’ve seen since she’s been here (bit to be fair so have I that many from MY anxiety stuff so like…idk), and any time I try to mention any of my very real (lawyers involved) medical stuff she’s just dismissive of it—saying “I GET IT” a lot while also saying the opposite of what I’m trying to say so I’m just getting really frustrated and I really truly love my sister and 87% of the time we get along great but I haven’t lived with her since we were kids and am kinda starting to see why she’s never friends with anyone she lives with after she lives with them. ..

1m254oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m254oh/can_you_boil_milk_in_an_electric_kettle/,Can you boil milk in an electric kettle?,"As someone who's always looking for kitchen hacks, I recently found myself wondering if I could boil milk in my electric kettle. It's a question that comes up more often than you might think, especially for those of us who love a quick cup of hot cocoa or want to streamline our morning latte routine.

The short answer is: technically, yes, you can boil milk in an electric kettle. But there are some important things to consider before you do.

First off, most electric kettles are designed primarily for boiling water. They heat up quickly and shut off automatically when the water reaches boiling point. Milk, on the other hand, behaves differently when heated. It's thicker than water and contains proteins and fats that can easily burn and stick to the bottom of the kettle.

If you decide to boil milk in your electric kettle, you'll need to keep a close eye on it. Milk heats up faster than water and can quickly boil over, creating a mess and potentially damaging your kettle. You'll also need to stir the milk frequently to prevent it from scorching on the bottom.

Another concern is cleaning. Milk leaves behind a residue that can be tough to clean, especially in kettles with hidden heating elements. This residue can affect the taste of anything else you heat in the kettle later on.

So, while it's possible to boil milk in an electric kettle, it's not the best idea. You're better off using a regular saucepan on the stove for heating milk. It gives you more control over the temperature and makes cleaning easier.

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I've found one that's versatile and great for boiling water quickly. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. It's perfect for tea, coffee, and even instant soups.

For those who frequently need to heat milk, there are specialized milk frothers and warmers available. These are designed specifically for milk and can heat it without burning or creating a mess.

In conclusion, while you can technically boil milk in an electric kettle, it's not recommended. It's safer and more practical to use other methods. Your electric kettle will thank you, and you'll avoid potentially ruining your morning coffee routine.

I did check the rules. And I am not confirmed pregnant, I just need advice and didn’t know where else to go. I am 19 years old, and I am worried about being berated by my mother if I ask her. (I moved out for college and now live with my partner.

I have been on birth control for about 4 months, and I accidentally skipped a pill about 2 weeks ago. And I didn’t think much of it. But now I’m second guessing. 

I’m nauseous after I eat breakfast. Which isn’t normal. It goes away usually right after I eat lunch. And the past couple days it comes back when I try to go to sleep. I’ve been eating tortilla chips when my partner (non-binary, they/them) eats their late night snack. But today I ate tortilla chips, like normal. And about two hours later had a panic attack for seemingly no reason. I don’t even remember why it occurred. But it got really bad. Hyperventilating, crying, and anger. Which because there was no trigger, it’s extremely concerning that it happened. And I was laying on them. Typically the only way my partner can calm me down when I don’t want them to leave me alone in the room is to squeeze my torso (to ground me), and talk me through breathing. 

Today though that didn’t work. I freaked out because it hurt. From my belly button down. And where it hurt the most was my lower abdomen. 

After they calmed me down we ended up cuddling to go to sleep. (I had woken them up with my panic attack) I lied their cuddled up with them for probably an hour. About thirty minutes before that they fell asleep. I got on my phone and watched some painting videos for probably another thirty minutes and then got up. I made a cup of coffee and have been sitting outside since. But now I’m extremely nauseous. And I have not gone to bed because of it. 

On the 15th I thought my period started early (which would have been approximately by two weeks) but it only lasted until sometime before 2pm yesterday. I was out with Ruby for there birthday all day. When we got home (around 5:30-6:00) I went to the bathroom and because I checked when we were out I knew I wasn’t bleeding anymore. But the blood was this darkish brown. Which I know for most people, isn’t normal, and it’s never occurred for me before. 

I’ve been bloated for 4-5 days and every single one of my bras hurt me. I’m not sure what to do.

Could I be pregnant? And if so, should I go to the gynecologist first or take a pregnancy test first? 

I have had no symptoms of other things that could cause me to bleed like that, at least not as far as I know. Random hormonal changes also should not be occurring because of my birth control. My gyno said if I bled longer than normal and have cramps that I need to stop taking the birth control immediately and alert her. But that has not happened since the first month of me being on birth control. 

Does anybody have any advice… 
And please don’t be mean. I don’t know what I’m doing. And I was never taught. 

PS, this was cross posted, I do know I need to take a test. And when Walmart opens I will be going to get one. But if I’m negative I don’t know what to do after that. Because I do know whatever this is, isn’t normal for me. ",1,1752751819.0,amipregnant,10,1.0,False

It's the type of place where you just go up to a counter and pick out your stuff and pay.  You can get your stuff to go (I did) or you can sit there.  

They offer sandwiches, soups, salads, and some coffee drinks in addition to the pastries.  Nothing is labor intensive.  If you chose to stay, the ""service"" is someone just dropping off your food from the kitchen.  They don't come and check on you, they don't refill your drinks, and they have bins for you to put your mugs / dishes in after you eat / drink something because the expectation is that you clear your table. The only thing they have to do is wipe off the table.  

This is bare minimum service, and that is fine.  But during check-out the tip options start at 20%.  When I checked out, I hit ""no tip"" because I wasn't staying, and all the girl did was put crap in a box (maybe 6 items).  I got the dirtiest look and she said sarcastically ""Have a nice day!"".  

This is ridiculous.  I am not tipping you 25% / 30% for putting some pastries in a box and ringing me up.

I just want to share my heart with you here. Have been watching your videos for a long time. You're just a ray of sunshine. Love you!  
  
I’m a 28F from India, and honestly, my dating life has been pretty shitty since school. Let me tell you a bit about myself first—I’m quite old-school, grew up watching Bollywood romantic movies, and basically lived in my own dreamy love story world. I was always a bit tomboyish, good at studies, good at sports, could write well, and loved painting/sketching.

Yeah, I’ve always been a little loud and short-tempered (way worse in my earlier days), but I’ve worked hard to manage it and have come a long way. Despite being strong-headed and vocal, I’ve been bullied a lot growing up and—believe it or not—I’ve always been a people pleaser. Still am, actually.

Anyway, through my teens and early 20s, I kept meeting guys who seemed great at first but ended up breaking my heart. I started thinking maybe something was wrong with me, and I got so used to being treated badly that I didn’t even expect better anymore. By the time I entered college, I had gone cold. I hated the idea of dating. I’d talk casually with guys but ghost them the moment I sensed bad vibes.

Even after being so careful, I somehow ended up in 2 bizarre relationship situations. Let’s talk about the first one.

My friends and I were in college from 2015–2018. There was this senior (let's call him M), from a different dept, who we’d often see near the café. One of my best friends—we’ll call her K—had a harmless crush on him. She found his IG, DMed him, and even told him she liked him. M responded very respectfully—he was already in a serious relationship and even had his GF’s name in his bio. Major green flag.

K was a little disappointed but honestly felt relieved to meet a guy who was decent and upfront.

Fast forward to our final year—one random day, I got a DM from M. I was confused because we’d never spoken. Even when K had a crush on him, I’d never interacted with him. I immediately told K, and she was surprised too, but curious. She told me to talk to him and figure out what’s going on.

So I did.

That same day, K also texted him. While I was chatting with M (just basic stuff), K messaged me saying '*he asked her if she’d be okay with him asking me out*.' WHAT?

Turns out, even back when K liked him, he had noticed me—but he was committed, nothing of it. He told us he had broken up 8 months ago and had gone completely MIA since. Now that he was ready to move on, he wanted to reach out to me.

K, being the amazing friend she is, encouraged me to talk to him. She said I deserved to open up again. I still refused his offer for coffee because I didn’t feel right dating someone my friend once liked—even if it was just a crush. He respected that and backed off.

Months later, he messaged me again. Casual chats turned into deeper convos. Then he said he '*couldn’t get me out of his mind'* and asked me out again. I told K everything—again—and by this time, both my friends were pushing me to give him a shot. K was already seeing someone else from work.

So, I started talking to M more seriously. No doubt—he was smart, funny, insightful, and sweet. After a couple of months of late-night convos, I finally agreed to go out for coffee. Fast forward a bit—we kissed in the rain (classic Bollywood moment), and we genuinely fell for each other.

We saw each other almost every day for months. I was totally in—like, '*crazy in love'*. He was a little rough around the edges, but nothing major I could see. Then slowly, things started feeling off.

He asked me to keep our relationship a secret until '*he was ready'* to tell people. He said if I didn’t respect that, we’d be over. I agreed—because I didn’t want to lose him. We were physically close—lots of making out—but we never had s\*x. Not because he didn’t try, but because something in me just wasn’t ready, and I couldn’t ignore that feeling.

Just a few months into our relationship, things started to change. M began acting strangely—rude, short-tempered, even a little aggressive. He started constantly asking for n\*des, and when I refused, he’d get visibly pissed off. I knew he was stressed—he was preparing for a military exam—so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But inside, I was hurting. I used to cry myself to sleep every night. My mind was racing, but my heart still held on to hope.

He’d say things like, *“Once I get into the army, I’ll marry you without wasting a second.”* And somehow, those words kept me going.

Eventually, he cleared the exam and had to leave for army training before his final recruitment interview. I was genuinely happy for him. But I had so many unanswered questions—things I’d been swallowing for weeks. He kept avoiding real conversations, so before he left, I told him, *“We need to talk when you get back.”*

While he was away, we barely spoke. He told me not to message him unless *he* called. When he did call, it was just for a few rushed minutes. I didn’t push, even though I was desperate for clarity.

Then he came back.

I gathered my courage and texted him:  
“Do you love me? Please be honest this time.”

His reply shattered me:  
“I don’t know.”

I was stunned. I replied,  
“What do you mean you don’t know? You were the one who said ‘I love you’ first.”

And then came the punch in the gut:  
“I said it in the rush of the moment. I need to think about certain things before jumping into something serious.”

I was shaking. My hands trembled. I couldn’t breathe. My eyes welled up, and the tears just started pouring. But somehow, I typed back:  
“Now you need to *think* about things? What things?”

He responded:  
“You know... let’s keep seeing each other, get closer, and then we’ll see if we’re really compatible.”

That was it. The switch flipped in my brain.

This was the same guy who: Would leave me stranded if we had an argument, Would never call, never bring me a single flower, Would ignore my texts for hours or days, Criticized me over small things—like not trimming my eyebrows “on time” because I was “his girlfriend now”, Would turn off his phone completely during fights, Made me feel like I wasn’t enough, constantly. He? HE? needs to think if I am good enough for him?

And yet, I remembered the way he once looked at me and said,  
“I’ve never seen eyes like yours—so innocent, so beautiful.”

Hey everyone — I’ve been doing alot of reading and looking through peoples experiences and reactions with the keto rash the past year as I was having the same issue.

My field of study is functional pathology with a speciality in dermal science/procedures.

I wanted to share what I learned from my own experience with “keto rash” (plus what actually fixed it) in order to help anyone struggling with this misunderstood condition.

I specialise in dermal functional integration — combining integrative pathology and dermal science to get to the root causes of skin issues. I’ll be doing research in this area soon, so I wanted to share something that’s been misdiagnosed in myself and many others.

⸻

Keto rash is often misunderstood.

Most journal articles say it’s bacterial, since antibiotics often help. But in my case — it wasn’t prurigo pigmentosa (true “keto rash”). It was actually seborrheic dermatitis that only came out in ketosis. Red, flaky, crusty skin on my forehead and beard area, only during deep ketosis. Nothing helped — and this was after experimenting with every possible fix you can think of.

What’s weird is it completely disappeared every time I ate carbs. That ruled out candida, histamine intolerance, food sensitivity, or even classic keto rash. I had to dig deeper.

So here’s a breakdown of possible root causes based on clinical mechanisms — and what actually worked for me in the end:

⸻

🔍 Possible causes to consider if you’re getting a rash in ketosis:

⸻

1. Low bile flow

High fat = more bile needed.
But if your gallbladder isn’t used to working properly (maybe due to sluggish metabolism, long-term low-fat dieting, etc.), bile can back up or thicken (sludge). Bile is antimicrobial and crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) — all essential for healthy skin. If bile is low, toxins and pathogens can overgrow or spill into the skin.

⸻

2. Low thyroid = low gallbladder function

Thyroid and gallbladder are tightly linked.
Low thyroid slows down metabolism, bile release, and digestive flow — especially if you’re running very low insulin (as in long-term deep keto/carnivore).
You might have this issue if your stools are:
	•	Pale
	•	Floating or greasy
	•	Require lots of wiping
	•	Or if you feel bloated after fatty meals

That means you’re likely not digesting fats or clearing waste properly → toxins come out via the skin.

⸻

3. Candida die-off

If you had underlying SIFO or Candida overgrowth, going low-carb might kill them off too quickly, causing a Herx reaction. If your liver or bile isn’t keeping up with the toxic load, your skin may be the exit route.

⸻

4. Excess acetone (from deep ketosis)

Ketones (especially acetone) can irritate skin through your sweat. That’s why people say keto rash gets worse in humid or sweaty areas — the sweat is more acidic, which can damage your skin barrier and lead to flare-ups.

⸻

5. Very low insulin (my case)

This was the main cause for me.

I’ve been keto since 2019 and had zero skin issues while eating veggies and moderate protein. But for the past year, I went strict carnivore — and that’s when this red, flaky, itchy facial rash showed up like clockwork when in ketosis.

Nothing helped. But every time I reintroduced carbs, it cleared. That told me it wasn’t fungal or histamine — it was metabolic.

After watching a lecture by Prof. Bart Kay, I learned that chronically suppressed insulin can affect thyroid, gallbladder, and water/electrolyte balance. That really hit home.

He also said:
👉 You need 2 large meals with enough protein to slightly spike insulin
👉 Small meals or OMAD with low protein may not trigger enough insulin for normal function
👉 Without insulin, thyroid conversion drops, bile release slows, cortisol increases, and the body becomes stressed

⸻

What fixed it for me:

I bumped up my protein to 150g/day, kept fat high, and stayed in ketosis — but now with slightly higher insulin levels from protein.

After just one week:
	•	Rash cleared
	•	Felt warmer
	•	Energy and libido came back
	•	Stool normalized
	•	Workout performance improved

I’m 6% body fat, very insulin-sensitive, and was running glucose as low as 3.2 mmol/L. For me, it was basically starvation-mode with extremely low insulin. That was the missing piece.

⸻

Try this if you’re dealing with keto-related skin issues:
	1.	Increase protein (don’t fear insulin — you need some)
	2.	TUDCA or bile salts for gallbladder support
	3.	Diluted apple cider vinegar on the skin (acidifies and calms yeast)
	4.	MCT oil topically or in coffee — antimicrobial and supports ketone production
	5.	Black seed oil (natural antifungal, anti-inflammatory)
	6.	Burdock + dandelion root tea — great for bile and liver drainage
	7.	Test bloods:
	•	Copper, selenium, thyroid panel
	•	Low copper especially = histamine intolerance, poor skin healing

⸻

Let me know if you’ve had something similar — I’m happy to help troubleshoot. And I’ll be researching more of these internal-skin links as part of my dermal functional integration work 💡

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I built a Terminid piñata by hand. Inside? Not bile. Not acid. But something far more potent: small packets of Liber-tea and coffee. Because true Helldivers deserve tactical refreshments after battle.

To finish the mission, I baked a large orange cake — decorated with the proud symbol of the Helldivers. One slice for Liberty. One for managed Democracy. And one more... just in case a bug gets back up.

She loved it. We laughed, we smashed, we feasted. Democracy was celebrated. The bug menace was purged.

He was going to a con to sell fish in my city, like an aquarium enthusiast sort of event.

The morning of the con had a tantrum about honey for his coffee. Before he got here I talked repeatedly to him and his wife who was also visiting but was not the problem, to make sure they'd have everything they needed while they were here. 

What snacks should I keep handy? What's their favorite breakfast? Etc.

At 5:45 am in the morning I was up making him his favorite breakfast because they had to get to the con early to prep, and he was freaking out about the fact that the Tupperware in my cabinet that says honey and sauces didn't have honey in it. I was out. He never mentioned needing honey. 

He had to choose between white sugar, brown sugar, and maple syrup for his coffee and he had a tantrum about it.

He said things like ""one thing goes wrong and everything is terrible"" and ""this was supposed to be a good day"" and then he sulked silently curled up into a ball on the couch in my kitchen. Until forty minutes to an hour later he tried coffee with maple syrup, realized it's delicious and immediately became calm again.

He was very lucky I had coffee at all. Me and my husband don't drink coffee. I had some in my freezer from my last guest who had *told me they had needed coffee*.

Of course there are lots of mitigating factors that don't actually mitigate anything. He forgot his anxiety meds. He didn't sleep well. I'm well aware, he was very clear about that.

While he was here he also kept leaving the door open to the room that had his five gallon buckets of fish in it even though I have a cat, and asked him to keep it closed.

and

He played hawk calls on his phone, in the morning, in the kitchen adjacent to our bedroom, after I specifically told him my husband sleeps late and to please keep it down in the morning. He did this in the room adjacent to our bedroom despite the fact that both the living room and the guest bedroom are on a different floor they had all to themselves.

Anyway after he left he apologized for ""the logistics"" and I snapped back that he should probably apologize for how he treated me instead.

He said he was doing his best, and he couldn't be the friend I needed and he needed space.

So I'm free but I'm still angry and somewhat bewildered and I would love someone to translate what just happened for me. Also could you please tell me his behavior was bizarre and outrageous and not excused by tiredness or anxiety?

1m24mv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1m24mv0/pet_peeve/,Pet peeve?,"Not a barista, but I currently work in the service industry. My biggest pet peeve walking into a coffee shop, especially during non-peak hours since that's the only time I get drinks due to my work schedule, is being greeted/asked what I'd like to get immediately upon entering. Before I even get a chance to like... fully open the door. It upsets me the most too when the layout of the shop is on the larger side, rather than a tiny little space so there's a lot of surface area to cover walking to the counter and I immediately just feel rushed. I feel super awkward because while I do know what I want usually, I don't want to shout it across the cafe when there's other people there, I'd rather just be greeted when I'm already at the counter. 
I know this is such a non-issue. I don't know why I constantly get baristas rolling their eyes in my face when I tell them I don't know what I want yet and would like to see the menu first. Then 30 seconds later I get the ""so do you know now??"" like no!! I'll tell you when I'm ready. Can I please get a moment? I understand they probably sit around fiddling their thumbs when it's slow but as a server we're taught not to do this and to give people their time rather than try to hurry them in and out.

1m24mq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contractor/comments/1m24mq9/do_this_to_grow_fast_ignore_it_and_watch_your/,Do this to grow fast. Ignore it and watch your business struggle.,"2 days ago, I listened to an episode of the Hammer & Grind podcast about customer experience, and it confirmed a thought I've been having lately.

(If you're a contractor and haven't heard of this podcast, you NEED to check it out.)

I believe the way you make customers feel, from the moment they reach out or fill out a contact form, to well after they’ve bought your product or service, can be the deciding factor between a thriving, multi-million dollar company and one that never grows and eventually fails. This applies to a lot of industries, including construction.

Customer journey can be more important than the quality of the service itself, so here are 3 lessons I took from that episode that can help you improve your customer experience:

1. Pay attention to what you value most when you're the customer. For example, think about what stood out during your last visit to a coffee shop, a great stay at a hotel, or even a not-so-great one.
2. Always aim to make a great first impression. Respond quickly when someone fills out your form, and try not to miss calls. Ideally, none at all. If you're too busy to answer the phone, let them know what the fastest and easiest way to be served is.
3. Have a clear process in place, from first contact to post-job follow-up, and let your customers know about it from the start. Guide your customers through each step so they always know where they are and what’s coming next.

To close, I’ll just add this: a great customer experience increases the likelihood of achievement in your customer’s eyes. The likelihood that they’ll get their dream outcome. This builds confidence, adds value to your service, and ultimately allows you to charge more.",1,1752750337.0,Contractor,4,0.54,False

We were having a team dinner party. He was looking at me while I was dancing, not in a creepy way. I caught his glances at me 2 to 3 times.

Whenever our team goes out for lunches or dinner, I often want to order something which I like but no one else is interested to order it. He always asks me that I can order it, there are a lot of people on the table, someone will surely help you finish it.

In a few meetings as well, I caught him looking at me, though I wasn’t the one who was speaking. 

While a group of us were having chit chat at a coffee table, all of them were communicating in a language I didn’t understand (their local language). So he (he also speaks that language) asked all of them to speak in a language I can understand as I was missing out on the conversation. Whenever they start conversing in their local language, he asks all of them to speak in my language. (this has happened many times)

It is a common norm in our team to wish birthday to a person whenever it is the date on a common WhatsApp group. It was my bday one day. No one in the team knew. I had put a WhatsApp story regarding my bday. As soon as he watched that story, he wished me in that group.

I am the co ordinator of ordering cakes for people in my team whenever it is someone’s bday. It happens many times that my UPI id doesn’t work, and no one steps in to help me, but he gives me his UPI to order the cake. 

He also sent me connection request on Snapchat etc and keeps on sending me snaps though I never send him anything. 

All this, even after I was very rude to him on one instance. (He kept on interrupting while I was speaking to someone), and also there are many such instances when I don’t reply to his messages on Teams channel. 

Can it mean he likes me or can it mean he is just being polite as a team member? Help me out. Because I would have never behaved like this with someone if I wouldn’t have liked them XD

Would be nice if I can get some perspective from men as well, because they would know better how a guy behaves when he likes a girl.

Edit: I know I shouldn’t date in my office, and I wouldn’t either. I just want to know if there’s some reason why he is doing this or just being polite.",9,1752750002.0,AskIndianWomen,30,0.8,False

He said the reason is that Saturday is their one day off together with each other and they'd like to sleep in, and that when he gets woken up by either the microwave or the kettle it puts him in a bad mood for the day.

Naturally because no one is the same, I'm an early riser and the roommate is a night owl, with me waking up around 6am and him around 8:30am. I also don't make coffee instantly when I wake up and usually roll out of bed around 8 anyway. 

To his credit he did approach it in a calm and respectful manner and just laid it out on the table which I do really appreciate, however I feel like as we all pay to live here you can't just ask someone to not use a part of the house before a certain time? All I want is a coffee in bed, but all he wants is a sleep in which I understand too.

Will your vision survive? Will your budget? Will you ever sleep again? Here’s a lighthearted, professional look at the real anxieties indie devs face when working with freelancers—and how to turn those fears into productive partnerships.

# Top Fears When Hiring Freelancers

* **Scope Creep Monster:** That “simple” task suddenly grows arms and legs and eats your timeline and budget.
* **Communication Void:** Messages disappear, instructions get lost in translation, and you start to wonder if you’re speaking the same language.
* **Quality Gremlins:** The work comes back… and it’s nothing like you imagined.
* **Budget Ghost:** That “affordable” freelancer is now more expensive than your coffee addiction.
* **IP & Ownership Goblins:** Who owns what? Who can use what?

# Survival Tips

* **Start Small:** Test the waters with a tiny task before handing over the keys to your kingdom.
* **Keep Talking:** Regular check-ins and clear project management save everyone’s nerves.
* **Be as Clear as Possible:** Details prevent disasters.
* **Treat Freelancers as Partners:** Respect gets results.
* **Check Progress Early:** Don’t wait until the end to review work.
* **Learn and Adapt:** Every hiccup is a lesson for next time.

# Community Call

Wrong, Its not…

Sell everything you don’t need or use, old clothes? that old exercise bike? old furniture? Stuff that you trip over every day but never use? With the proceeds buy PM..

when you are asked “what do you want for your birthday“ ? PM please!

You do overtime at work, put a little into PM..

You receive a stimulus check, buy PM..

you get some kinda fiat windfall, buy PM

Make real food from scratch instead of expensive take outs, buy PM with the savings ..

Invest in a thermos flask and make your own coffee to take to work … buy PM with the savings..

Bulk buy food and save money, buy PM with the savings..

Drive more economically, guessed what to do with the savings yet 😂

Getting married? Do it on the cheap, don’t spend silly amounts of money on one day, scale back, and if asked what wedding gifts you want, ask for fiat and convert into PM..

Grow your own food, repair your own clothes, enjoy the simple things in life…. And use those savings to buy PM…

Happiness does not come from “pointless stuff“ it does not make you happy either, but knowing you are financially “sorted“ gives you wonderful peace of mind…

1000 oz is far more achievable than you first imagine….

In today’s digital landscape, ensuring your application can handle growing traffic while maintaining performance is crucial. Scalability and load balancing are foundational concepts for achieving this. This guide explains these concepts, their importance, and how they work together to create robust systems. Let’s dive in!

# Understanding Scalability

Scalability is a system’s ability to manage increased demand without sacrificing speed or reliability. Imagine a coffee shop that can serve more customers by adding baristas or opening new locations. In tech, scalability ensures an application can support more users, process larger data volumes, or handle traffic spikes.

There are two primary approaches to scalability:

* **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up):** This involves boosting a server’s capacity by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage. It’s like upgrading a single machine to do more work. While simple, it has limits due to hardware constraints.
* **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out):** It refers to adding additional servers to evenly handle the workload. It’s akin to opening multiple branches to serve more customers. This method is often more flexible and cost-effective for large systems.

Scalability is vital for delivering consistent performance, minimizing downtime, and supporting growth.

# What is Load Balancing?

Load balancing spreads incoming traffic across several servers to ensure no single server gets overloaded. Think of it as a traffic controller directing cars to open lanes on a highway to avoid congestion. A load balancer ensures efficient resource use, faster response times, and system reliability.

Load balancers use algorithms like:

* **Round Robin:** Distributes requests sequentially across servers for even load sharing.
* **Least Connections:** Directs traffic to the server with the least number of active connections, making it suitable for handling uneven workloads.
* **IP Hash:** Assigns requests based on the user’s IP address, ensuring consistent server assignment.

Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based, often integrated into cloud platforms. They also monitor server health, rerouting traffic from failing servers to maintain uptime.

# Why Scalability and Load Balancing Are Essential

As user bases grow, systems face increased pressure. Without scalability, applications may slow down or crash during peak usage, frustrating users and impacting revenue. Load balancing enhances scalability by evenly distributing workloads, optimizing performance, and ensuring high availability. Together, they create systems that can handle growth while delivering a seamless user experience.

# Benefits of Scalability and Load Balancing

* **Enhanced Performance:** Faster response times improve user satisfaction.
* **Reliability:** Redundant servers and load balancing reduce downtime risks.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Horizontal scaling enables gradual addition of resources, helping you avoid unnecessary upfront investment.
* **Adaptability:** Systems are capable of managing unexpected traffic spikes, such as those caused by promotions or viral events.

# Tips for Effective Scalability and Load Balancing

1. **Design for Scale:** Build systems with future growth in mind to avoid costly redesigns.
2. **Leverage Cloud Tools:** Cloud platforms offer built-in scalability and load balancing solutions.
3. **Monitor Metrics:** Track performance indicators to spot and resolve bottlenecks early.
4. **Optimize Code:** Efficient application and database design reduces server strain.
5. **Test Under Stress:** Simulate high-traffic scenarios to ensure system resilience.

# Conclusion

**Scalability and load balancing** are critical for creating reliable, high-performing systems. By scaling up or out and using load balancing to distribute traffic, you can ensure your application remains fast, accessible, and ready for growth. Whether managing a small website or a global platform, mastering these concepts is key to thriving in a digital-first world.

And I was that dangerous topic.  
Just as his ninth little plaything was being welcomed into the house, I was being forced to kneel and serve her coffee.  
The sweet, innocent-looking girl smiled demurely, but she splashed the scalding coffee across my hand.  
The next second, Hudson's polished leather shoe slammed viciously into my ch//est, his eyes wild with rage.  
""This is the eighth time. Haven't you gotten the hint?""  
""Can't even hold a cup of coffee steady. Might as well chop off those useless hands!""  
His kick sent me sprawling on the floor, yet I still bowed my head submissively and apologized.  
Everyone assumed I'd keep crawling back to Hudson Cross like a pathetic doormat.  
But then I vanished from his world entirely.  
The always imperious Hudson Cross spent the next TEN YEARS desperately looking for me.  
  
Hudson didn't say a word, just stared at me with those dark, threatening eyes.  
  
I didn't dare look up, banging my forehead against the floor over and over, not caring that blood streamed down my face.  
  
The wedding guests watched like this was just another show.  
  
Everyone knew I was Hudson Cross's least favorite woman.  
  
In this city, anyone could step on me.  
  
""Seraphina, you did this on purpose, didn't you?!""  
  
Hudson was built like a tank—a guy who'd fought his way up from the streets.  
  
One kick sent my body into spasms. I couldn't straighten up.  
  
""You know well I can't have blood at my wedding, but you made yourself look like roadkill anyway! Trying to make me look like a joke?!""  
  
His crew got fired up, like they wanted to tear me apart.  
  
Hudson had come up through the underground, and today's wedding was packed with his old crew.  
  
Who would dare laugh at him?  
  
But plenty of people had been itching to see me get what was coming...  
  
""Since you love kneeling so much, stay right there!""  
  
""You get up when the wedding's over. Not a second before.""  
  
His voice faded as he walked away. When I looked up again, Hudson had already switched back to his charming act, arm around Delilah Sterling—his new woman, smiling like some refined gentleman.  
  
Maybe it was just me, but tonight's reception dragged on forever. The drunk guests didn't scatter until well past midnight.  
  
When I finally struggled to my feet, exhausted, my legs had gone completely numb from the poor circulation.  
  
But I knew Hudson Cross. The man had power, and he had a thousand ways to make people suffer. This punishment was just getting started.  
  
Sure enough, a servant from the main house rushed over, rolling her eyes like I was some kind of bad luck charm, acting all high and mighty.  
  
""The master just got married today, so get your ass to the bridal suite and serve them!""  
  
""If you piss off the new missus, you're gonna regret it!""  
  
Hudson Cross had nine wives total, and every time he brought home a new one, he found creative ways to humiliate me.  
  
The servant shoved me toward the main house and kicked me down to kneel outside the bedroom door.  
  
The door suddenly swung open, and Delilah Sterling was draped all over Hudson, her exposed skin covered in bright red marks.  
  
I looked down, lying to myself, while my heart felt like it was being sliced open.  
  
Hudson acted like he couldn't see my pathetic state and coldly ordered:  
  
""Delilah's delicate. If she gets pregnant, she's in trouble. Go buy a couple boxes of Plan B.""  
  
My throat went dry, like it was weighed down with lead.  
  
""I can go, but I'll need money for—""  
  
Before I could finish, Delilah cut me off with a mocking laugh.  
  
""Oh please, girl. I've seen tons of women try to gold-dig Hudson, but this is pathetic even for you.""  
  
""Two boxes of Plan B? What's that, like fifty bucks?""  
  
""Sweetie, you eat Hudson's food, live in Hudson's mansion—the Cross family's probably dropped millions on you by now. Nickel and diming him over this? That's just tacky.""  
  
She really was the city's golden girl everyone raved about—chin raised high, every inch of her dripping with elegance.  
  
Next to her, I looked like garbage in my cheap rental dress, hunched over with a spine that would never straighten, like some pathetic cockroach crawling out of a sewer.  
  
Nobody knew that despite carrying the title of Mrs. Cross, I lived worse than the kitchen staff.  
  
All that glamour and beauty? Just what outsiders assumed. The rotten reality was Hudson's masterpiece.  
  
He'd frozen all my bank accounts, cut off every connection I had to the outside world, turning me into his caged canary, bleeding as I sang.  
  
I don't know what others thought, but I literally didn't have a dime to my name.  
  
""Pathetic!""  
  
Hudson's eyes filled with disgust as he flicked a credit card at me.  
  
The sharp edge sliced across my cheek, stinging.  
  
""The master said since you disrespected the new missus, you have to handle the condom run by yourself.""  
  
""If you happen to die out there, we'll scrape you off the pavement!""  
  
The memory of being kicked off the estate was still fresh as I instinctively curled up tighter.  
  
This was the city's famous rich district—barely any traffic on a normal day, and at this late hour, the streets were completely dead.  
  
If it weren't for Hudson Cross, this other half of the city would've had nothing to do with me.  
  
Back then, Hudson had just survived some big trouble and was clawing his way toward legitimacy with more guts and cunning than anyone else had.  
  
The day we met, it was raining.  
  
I ducked into a bus stop with soaked hair, and suddenly a black umbrella covered half my body.  
  
Hudson was chewing the inside of his cheek, something unreadable flickering in those dark eyes. ""Take it.""  
  
The rest of that memory's pretty hazy, but I remember that black umbrella ended up covering the rest of my life.  
  
They say persistent guys always win over stubborn girls, and I basically stalked Hudson Cross into making me his wife through sheer shamelessness and determination.  
  
On our first anniversary, I left the house to prepare a surprise for him.  
  
When I came back, the place was packed with people, and my parents were lying in pools of blood, barely breathing.  
  
And the man who'd been calling them ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" was standing there with a knife, his eyes full of obsession and sickness.  
  
""Seraphina, you're never leaving me...""  
  
That demonic whisper haunted me like a curse, becoming the source of my worst nightmares.  
  
How could I forget? Hudson Cross was a killer who'd clawed his way up from he//ll. He didn't get off on romance and tenderness—he got off on control and violence.  
  
No matter how polished his surface became, he couldn't change the bloodthirsty nature in his bones.  
  
This twisted meeting of ours should've been corrected a long time ago...  
  
When I dragged my exhausted body back to the mansion, Hudson was having breakfast with Delilah Sterling wrapped around him.  
  
The shopping bag in my hand was getting sweaty from my grip, but Hudson didn't even glance at it before a servant wisely tossed it in the garbage.  
  
Nothing cheap was allowed in the Cross household.  
  
Hudson making me buy condoms wasn't about the condoms—it was about humiliating me.  
  
""Sweetie, why are you so late getting back?""  
  
Delilah rubbed her stomach, practically glowing with happiness.  
  
""Hudson was pretty rough with me last night! I might already be carrying his baby.""  
  
""This would be Hudson's first child. Aren't you happy for me?""  
  
A child...  
  
Hudson and I had tried for a baby once, but what did I get for it?  
  
He brought home Mistress Number Two and publicly humiliated me on their wedding night to make an example of me.  
  
I lost that baby anyway, and all Hudson did was tear me apart with his words.  
  
""Seraphina, you're a wh//ore! I should put a bullet in your head!""  
  
Several deaths were on my hands, and I also figured only dying could pay for my sins.  
  
But what about Hudson Cross?  
  
What gave him the right to live his perfect life?!  
  
The man who killed my father, put my mother in the ICU for life, turned everyone against me, and murdered my unborn child—  
  
Wasn't that the same asshole sitting there behind his fake mask?!  
  
My body shook as I held it all in, while Delilah played helpless princess.  
  
""I'm still so sore down there...""  
  
She gazed at Hudson with bedroom eyes.  
  
""Your wife's been with you the longest—she must know how to make it feel better. Be sweet and let her take care of me...""  
  
Hudson always gave her whatever she wanted, deciding my fate in seconds, his tone final.  
  
""Delilah had a long night. You're staying by her side to wait on her.""  
  
""If anything goes wrong, I'll let you pay!""  
  
One word from Hudson, and I went from Mrs. Cross to Delilah's slave—worse than the hired help.  
  
With Delilah's blessing, the servants read the room and started spitting in my meager meals, not bothering to hide their contempt and disgust.  
  
I'd barely managed to doze off in the storage room when a piercing howl cut through my half-sleep.  
  
""Snowball!""  
  
Something told me to check the backyard, but I got clubbed to the ground the second I stepped outside.  
  
""Well, well, Seraphina. I thought you were this zen, want-nothing saint, but turns out you had other plans! How dare you sic your mutt on me?!""  
  
Delilah was lounging in a chair, glowing, while my golden retriever lay on the ground, barely breathing.  
  
""I didn't...""  
  
Snowball was the gentlest dog ever—he'd never attack anyone.  
  
But Delilah's servants were all holding thick clubs, their eyes vicious and terrifying to look at.  
  
""Disobedient dogs should just be put down...""  
  
Delilah examined her fresh manicure, her tone casual.  
  
Countless clubs rained down on Snowball like bamboo shoots, snuffing out his breath instantly.  
  
I held my dog, my heart clenched tight, dying inside.  
  
Hudson rushed over and saw the horrifying scene, exploding with rage.  
  
""Who did this?!""  
  
Delilah got up from her chair, putting on her pitiful act.  
  
""I heard you loved this dog, so I came to bond with him. But when your wife saw me with the puppy, she just lost it and started screaming to kill it.""  
  
""If she had a problem with me, she could've just said so. Why take it out on the poor dog?""  
  
""She knew this was your favorite, didn't she?""  
  
The second he heard I killed the dog, all the rage drained from Hudson's body.  
  
He even smiled pleasantly, like the calm before a storm.  
  
I sensed something off and was about to explain when Hudson calmly made a phone call.  
  
""Stop the medication. Let someone collect the body!""  
  
Soul-crushing dread washed over me instantly. I had a horrible feeling and numbly pulled out my phone.  
  
I was about to call the doctor when the hospital called me instead.  
  
""Mrs. Cross, I'm sorry to inform you that Mrs. Vale has passed away. Please accept our condolences...""  
  
Hudson acted like he hadn't just done something inhuman, smoothing his lips into a civilized smile.  
  
""A life for a life. You got what you deserved.""  
  
""Deserved?""  
  
That was the biggest joke I'd ever heard.  
  
My parents' lives, Snowball's life, and my unborn child's life—what could Hudson Cross possibly give back?!  
  
I rushed to the hospital. Hudson's knife had nearly killed my mother years ago, leaving her bedridden for the rest of her life.  
  
But she'd endured all these years for me.  
  
Now she lay alone in the morgue, and I couldn't even give her a proper funeral.  
  
After getting my mother's ashes, I still couldn't accept the reality. I cried until I was nearly blind in one eye before finally collapsing on the street.  
  
When I woke up, I was in an empty room.  
  
My eyes were on fire, and my mother's ashes were nowhere to be found.  
  
I was about to leave when the door slammed open.  
  
Delilah Sterling looked down at me, her eyes full of jealousy and hatred.  
  
""You're so lucky Hudson picked you.""  
  
""Too bad the position of Mrs. Cross can only be mine...""  
  
At her command, a group of men burst into the room.  
  
Their perv//erted eyes stripped me bare, shamelessly roaming every part of my body.  
  
""What are you doing?! Stay back!""  
  
I couldn't control my trembling, even feeling a wave of regret.  
  
""I'm Hudson Cross's wife! If you touch me, he'll kill you all!""  
  
My warning proved ineffective. They lunged forward like the most primal creatures, forcefully pushing me onto the bed.    
  
My struggling just turned them on more, awakening the animals inside them.  
  
I felt dead inside, not even noticing when someone else walked in.  
  
Hudson stood in the doorway, his dark eyes blazing with rage and violence.  
  
Delilah stood beside him, fake-defending me.  
  
""Hudson, don't get the wrong idea about her.""  
  
""You had the hospital stop Mrs. Vale's medication—she's obviously heartbroken. She just screwed up, she'd never actually betray you...""  
  
Something set Hudson off, and he suddenly went berserk, throwing everyone off me.  
  
He didn't say a word, just started swinging. His fists were quickly stained with blood as he beat them half to death.  
  
Pure terror consumed the men, and they spilled everything.

# Benefits Of Choosing The Right Coffee Beans

Choosing the right coffee beans can transform your morning ritual into a health-boosting experience. Not only does coffee offer a delightful kickstart to your day, but selecting the healthiest beans can amplify its benefits. Imagine savoring your cup of coffee, knowing it’s contributing positively to your well-being. Let’s delve into how picking the right beans can make a real difference.

Did you know that coffee is packed with antioxidants? These powerful compounds help fight free radicals in your body, reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Choose beans like Arabica, known for their high antioxidant content, to enhance your coffee’s health benefits. Next time you brew, think of it as a tasty shield for your body.

The right coffee beans can sharpen your focus and boost mental clarity. Ever noticed how a cup of good coffee helps clear the morning fog? Beans with high caffeine content, like Robusta, can enhance cognitive function. Consider this your brain’s wake-up call, nudging you towards better productivity.

Certain coffee beans support digestive health, acting as a gentle stimulant for your system. Lightly roasted beans maintain more of their natural compounds, aiding digestion. Next time you sip, remember you’re not just enjoying coffee, but nurturing your gut too.

Opting for quality coffee beans can contribute to heart health. Studies suggest that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of heart disease. When you choose beans that are ethically sourced and naturally processed, you’re taking a step towards a healthier heart.

Coffee isn’t just a beverage; it’s a mood booster. Choosing beans that suit your taste can elevate your spirits. Have you ever felt that sense of happiness after the first sip of your favorite brew? It’s real, and it’s why selecting the right beans matters.

Do you remember a time when a cup of coffee turned your day around? That’s the magic of choosing the right beans. It’s not just about flavor—it’s about fueling your health and happiness. What will your next cup bring you?

A new place welcomed her, filled with space that finally matched her dreams. No more hiding or shrinking; she refused to beg to be seen.  

She gave her loyalty to men who valued control   over connection who praised her softness but   punished her strength. They called her ""too much,"" but only when only when they lost the ability to keep her small and she refuses to stay small.

She used to confuse chaos for passion.  
Now she knows better.  
Peace is her kink.  
Silence is her sanctuary.  
And freedom?  
That’s her lover now.  

She’s no longer waiting for a call or crumbs of   affection. Now, she sips her coffee slowly   unbothered and untangled.  

No more emotional breadcrumbs, no secret roles in someone else's story. No more apologies for loving loudly and leaving harder.  

She didn’t burn bridges; she simply outgrew the path. 

And this time?  
She’s walking into something greater.  
Something that belongs fully to her.

My bed is still very cloud like :) I had my electric blanket on for a little bit last night and it warmed up pretty quickly and I felt it! I was unsure if I’d be able to given my two big squishy mattress toppers. It’s the first time I’ve used my electric blanket. Anyway I slept fine. 

I sat in a session for the business hosted by one of my old/normal time and I do kind of miss advisory type work. I’d hate to host something like that and would avoid it at all costs, but the topics I mean. It was about PL, though I cringed internally when she gave out some incorrect info at the Q&A section at the end but oh wellllllll. 

My anxiety has been higher recently, to the point my nails are bitten and I’ve been picking at my lip. It’s okay and all, I’m usually so much better with those two things and can handle/manage them better but sometimes I start doing them and have no idea til later. It’s so annoying. Anyway I currently have my nail mask and cuticle oil massaged in and lip balm on and my lips will be fine by tomorrow as they always are. It’s so gross. I don’t really admit it to anyone and don’t like to do it around people, obviously. It’s so disgusting. It makes me feel even more disgusting and ugly. It just makes me feel better. 

I feel really flat this afternoon. 

I cleaned my bathrooms at least. 

I want to redo my bedroom. 

Okay so. I had my psychiatrist appointment yesterday morning annnnnnd like I said, I have adhd. Inattentive adhd, to be specific. I don’t really know how I feel about this. I feel kind of upset, because I don’t want it. I also feel a sense of relief, because it explains a lot and now I might be able to find ways to make life easier. I feel kind of humoured because it’s just adding another thing to the list of things that are wrong and difficult about me. I feel nervous because… I’m not actually sure why, but I do have this underlying buzz of nervousness. I suppose that’s my old pal anxiety. She said she believes my anxiety and depression aren’t a result of the adhd and are their own things, I was kind of hoping if I did get this diagnosis that it means the anxiety and depression were just symptoms of the adhd but apparently my issues with them are too severe for that. But who knows, I will see how managing this adhd goes and maybe it will have a huge impact on my other mental health difficulties. Idk. Anyway. I’ll think about it all at some point. I’m upping/doubling my usual ssri dose as of today and then starting adhd meds next week on a low dose for a week then to a more normal dose the following if all goes well aka I don’t have panic attacks left right and centre. Anyway idk how I feel about it all. I need to research it some more, I still don’t fully even understand what adhd is or how it affects someone internally. I guess it’s not lost on me that I have procrastinated the research for months as it felt too overwhelming. 

My face skin is so soft at the moment. I NEED TO TRACK THIS FACE OIL DOWN SOMEWHERE.  

I’m headachey. 

I told him yesterday, as soon as I finished my appointment even, and before anyone else, and idk his reaction kind of made me feel…. hm. How did it make me feel? Disregarded, I think the word might be? Maybe. Maybe not. Anyway he said well that’s hardly a surprise or something to that effect which is entirely fine, but he didn’t ask how I felt about it or how it went - knowing full well I’ve been nervous about it - and idk. I get he’s unwell but that doesn’t mean I cease to exist during that time, I’m more than okay to be patient and give him space while he’s going through such an awful period but equally that doesn’t mean he can sort of just treat me like I don’t exist or I don’t have feelings. It kind of feels that way. He hasn’t made a point to call even for a minute just to say hi when maybe he has the slightest respite, he doesn’t ask how I am, idk. Well now I’m tearing up like a baby. I feel like my expectations for him while he’s going through this period are fair - they’re incredibly low and I am giving him so much space and time and basically doing what he’s asking of me. And it’s honest to god fine. Idk. Am I being selfish? Probably. I just still want to feel like he cares.  Ut I mean when I’ve had bad periods I find it hard to take other people into account, so I guess it could just be that. I just wish he’d still talk to me like he at least has some semblance of an interest in me on days he feels a bit better/feels able to. But then… do I want that? Because it feels like we’ve run out of things to talk about. I just can’t tell if this is all down to him feeling unwell and me still learning how to navigate that, or if we’ve just run our course and it’s time to let go of us. I feel less afraid of losing him since trying to shift my mindset these last few months. In therapy we’ve been talking about things I can and can’t control, and something I can’t control is what others do (to my extreme surprise) and so I can only really control my own actions and decisions. This is all obvious when you say it but my subconscious doesn’t align with logic so. But anyway what I’m trying to get at is that the things I want in life don’t hinge on me being with a man to build them with me, I can actually work towards these things on my own. So whether he is with me or not, I’ll be okay. I can’t rely on anyone else, it’s why my main focus is my relationship with myself and I do feel it slowly but surely getting better. I’m also trying to not associate him as my only chance at happiness and love, that’s something I have been doing a long time and it makes me terrified of losing him. I need to want him, not need him. So I’m still afraid of losing him, but not the way I used to be. I am afraid of the *what if* though, because I don’t think that will ever go away and I’m unsure how easy that is to live with. So anyway long story short, I want him but I don’t *need* him and that’s quite a freeing thought. Anyway I shall just continue on, if he doesn’t want me then he knows how to end it. Goddd but I’m just so in love with him.  

I can’t drink coffee soon apparently with the new medication. Bye bye coffee machine. Tbf it does sweet f all unless I have like four of them it’s more a nice hot drink. I guess I shall be a tea girl again. I wanted to be a herbal tea person again anyway. Hm. Maybe coffee on weekends as I probs won’t take medication then. Maybe. Idk. 

I feel so ugly. 

I need new affirmations but idk what to choose. 

I need to meal prep some dinners. I have leftover rice for dinner today though. I think I will add some more egg and veggies. 

I feel *so* flat. I have that feeling where I want/need to cry but can’t, it kind of hurts.

I speak fluent Kyrgyz, English, and Russian, and I’m just finishing my PhD, specializing in theoretical quantum physics and machine learning. I’ve spent years studying and working in many different countries and universities—from Harvard to Cambridge. The last decade has been a blur of grinding academic and professional deadlines - Publishing paper and endless work.

However, now I want to slow everything down and reset.

I have family here, and over the last few years I’ve been coming back home more often, setting up tourism tours to show my beautiful country to the rest of the world. That venture is now quite successful. Right now, I’m at a bit of a reset point—slowing everything down until I figure out what to do next. I’ve turned down a few job offers abroad for the time being.

I’m based in Kyrgyzstan for now, but I struggle to find like-minded people. Tourists who come for a few weeks love it here, but there are a few downsides to living in the country. It’s a different culture. I often find that academic backgrounds or creative thinking aren’t especially appreciated—it can feel more like a dog-eat-dog world. Having been away for so long, I don’t have many local connections apart from family. I’m hoping to meet people who have the same drive to learn, work, and build something meaningful—maybe even here in Kyrgyzstan.

I still work on scientific projects, and I used to have an amateur boxing license with experience in all areas of mixed martial arts. Training has been a big part of my life, and I’d love to find people who enjoy it too.

08/11/90

 
There were two places I had in mind for next time. The old fruit market, down by the Clyde, or the dilapidated building that used to be the ABC Cinema. 

The cinema stood out to me the most, but I was pretty sure that was because I had read strange articles about its closure. I had never gone inside, mind you, but something about it lingered in my mind. It would be cool to see what was left inside.

The old fruit market would have been fun too, though, it was where my Aunt used to sell her fruit and veg before she passed. I never got to visit her at work. Better late than never.

09/11/90

I ran into Michael down at the photography club. He said the old fruit market had been cordoned off due to a stabbing, so I guessed that was off the list.
The plan was to head to the ABC building the day after tomorrow.

10/11/90

I knew I had said two days but I just wanted to have a look around the outside, to see if there was any real way to get inside without someone calling the police. 

There seemed to be an unbarricaded entrance right at the front, the only thing I had to watch out for was other people.

If I went early enough, there wouldn't be anyone around. It was still winter, which meant it would be pitch black before 8am. I would head there for 7am just to be sure. The street was so deserted, it felt like another world, and that was just from the outside.

Just before I left I realised I had been watching the exterior of the building for longer than I thought. The sun had almost set and I could have sworn I had heard laughter coming from inside the cinema. 

Maybe someone else had the same idea, or maybe it was just the way sound carried in empty places. Either way, I thought I’d go for a pint before heading home.

11/11/90

5AM.

I had been worried that there would be early commuters who might’ve seen me trying to get into the ABC. I thought I’d head down earlier since I was already awake.

6AM.

I stood outside, coffee in hand. There really was something otherworldly about this place. It was like time had stood still. Old ‘70s showings were still lettered on the marquee: Grease and Jaws 2. The cracks in the facade looked like they had always been there, while the vines and ivy desperately grasped at the broken windows. It felt more like a theatre than a cinema. A half-torn ‘Closed for Renovation’ sign hung lopsided on the front doors, its letters bleached almost white by time.

My fears of being seen by commuters faded when I realised I’d been standing here for over 25 minutes and hadn’t seen a single person, not even a fox. I stepped closer to the entrance and caught a faint whiff of something sweet. Popcorn? 

Everything was in ruins but the marquee. It remained pristine, almost untarnished, as if the years hadn’t dared touch it. The ticket booth’s glass was shattered, old ticket stubs littered the ground, and deep cracks ran through the stonework.

The moment I stepped into the foyer, the outside world fell silent. Not gradually, like walking into an empty building, but all at once, like a switch had been flipped. The air inside was thick, humid, almost oppressive, even though it was a crisp 5°C outside.

I took my time carefully photographing every piece of history I could find, focusing on the things left behind. Pieces of clothing, tills, machinery. 

It seemed as though people had left in a hurry. No company would abandon tills full of money unless there was a good reason for it. And why hadn’t the money been stolen after all these years?

I climbed the five steps leading deeper inside the cinema, inspecting the movie posters as I went. The ones that were behind glass had hardly aged a day in almost 20 years. Movies I’d never heard of from times I’d never experienced. 

Thinking of this place bustling and full of life gave me a strange sense of loss. 

Why had they never completed the renovations? Surely this was a listed building?

7AM 

I found one of those “You Are Here” maps on the wall and used it as a guide, planning my route through the womb of the building and up into its heart. The projection room. I had read somewhere years ago that it might still be operable, and I wanted to take a look for myself.

As I traced my path and tried to commit it to memory, I thought I heard distant murmuring voices. Immediately, my mind went to the laughter I had heard yesterday while standing outside. 

It was entirely possible that people were living in this building, and it was just as possible that my ears were playing tricks on me. 

I hesitated for a moment, but I knew I would still go inside. 

There was something else, though, something I couldn't put my finger on. It hung in the air, distant yet rancid, like the stench of a dying animal.

7:30AM

I stepped through the shattered door leading further inside; the ivy crawled around the frame as if it were reclaiming it. I shone my torch ahead, catching a flicker of movement at the edge of the light. I adjusted the angle, nothing. Just an empty waiting room, the old concession stand looming in the middle, swallowed by darkness. 

At the concession stand stood an old popcorn machine, its interior coated in a blackened substance. It was probably mould, but when the beam from my torch hit it, it looked alive, shiny and glistening, as if waiting for someone to touch it. 

The “You Are Here” map had shown a clear path to the projection room, but as I moved deeper into the building, it felt like wandering through a forest at night, my sense of direction fading, replaced by a growing sense of unease. The murmuring I thought I heard before was gone now, leaving only the silence ringing in my ears.
 
I cautiously stepped through the debris and broken glass, each crunch underfoot like tiny bombs exploding in the silence. I had documented the concession stand and then turned to visualise my route. I wanted to check out some of the cinema rooms before I headed upstairs. I swung my torch around, carefully scanning the numbers on the cinema room doors. I chose one at random, Screen 6, walked toward it, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.

8AM

The walkway into the theatre was so dark it felt like I could reach out, grab a handful, and slip it into my pocket. Without my torch, navigating this space would be impossible. I tried not to dwell on the fact that I had only brought one torch and a single set of batteries. 

I pushed open the double doors and was instantly struck by the overwhelming red. The walls, seats, carpets, and curtains. All red. As I scanned the room, I realized it was much larger than the exterior of the building had suggested. The walls loomed tall and cracked, and where ceiling lights once hung, only gaping black voids remained.

Amid the sea of seats, one stood out, a single chair pushed down, as if someone was sitting there.

I walked over to investigate, expecting to find a broken mechanism or rusted hinges, keeping it down. Instead, I found a perfectly functional seat, undamaged by time. Not a single piece of debris rested on it. It looked sterile compared to everything around it.
 
At first, I didn’t think much of it. A bit strange, maybe, how clean it was. Just a seat, nothing more. 

But the longer I stared at it, the more certain I became. 

Someone was sitting there. 

I shifted on my feet, suddenly aware of how wild my thoughts had become, and decided now would be a good time to head upstairs.
 
My mouth was so dry it felt like I had eaten sand, I quickly shuffled my way out of the row of seats back onto the stepped aisle. While walking up the steps to the exit, a burning desire crept over me, I needed to turn around.

I turned, almost expecting to see someone staring back at me. Instead, I found everything exactly as it was. The strange seat still down, everything else still in its place. 

I shook my head, how had my thoughts become so fantastical? I winced at myself. How many years had I done urban exploration? The only scary thing here is my imagination.
 
I hurriedly pushed the door open, which led directly back into the thick black walkway. 

As I took my first step into the abyss, I heard it. 

The familiar sound of a cinema seat, returning to its normal upright position. ",1,1752748427.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m23z5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiai/comments/1m23z5k/ai_images_arent_art_an_artists_take_analysisvalue/,AI images aren't art - an artist's take (analysis/value),"I'm going to give AI pictures a practical value and then analyse why they don't count as art anyway. I'm using it as a way to tackle the concerning rise of people considering themselves artists and trying to bar us from denying that under the guise of ""good faith debate"" - particularly on various other subreddits. With that said, let's begin.

Hi, I'm an artist! Not one who sells his work, nor publishes it, but I do it as a hobby and as I'm looking into writing and composing as careers, I'm familiar with the art world, publication and copyright laws etc. 

More specifically, I'm a pyrographer. If you don't know what that means, it's the art of burning wood to create art using hot tools! I do a bit of drawing and painting on the side of that, but pyrography is my main medium and thankfully AI can never rip it off - or at least, not for a while. So in this post, I'm going to be using pyrography as the reference point for real art - here goes.

My main argument here is that AI products are inherently less valuable than real art, and here's why: when you pay for art you are paying for three things primarily - time, resources and creative concept/skill. In this sense, art does have a real, practical value.

\- An image will take barely five minutes to generate if you include prompting time. 

\- Resources are negligible. Maybe half a per cent of computer charge and some RAM, which do not count. Maybe the models too, but as they're one-time payments (if they're paid at all), their use becomes less valuable with each image. Subscriptions to sites that can train LoRAS (Low-Ranking Adaptations) can be argued for, but they're a separate issue I'll get to in a minute. I'm not going to count the computer itself because most people have them, for a variety of purposes aside from the images.

\- Creative concept is the only one you can really make a case for here, and it's undercut by the fact that there is no skill involved, as the quote unquote ""artist"" is ""teaching"" the models to emulate the style they want and not producing the results manually. In fact, there are services which train the LoRAS for you! Just another step in distancing yourself from actually making anything. Also something I'll get to in a bit.

  
So, my pyrography example: recently I created a piece about the size of a door, depicting a Chinese *lung* dragon. I didn't time myself precisely, but I reckon it took me 30 minutes to sand everything and ensure the wood was prepared, 30 minutes to draw the dragon and the various symbols and inscriptions surrounding it, maybe 12 hours to burn it, and another two hours decorating it with sand, coffee wash etc. About 15 hours.   
Using the minimum wage for people in my country - £10 an hour ($13.41 for my American readers, and 11.56 Euro) - I could reasonably therefore charged £150 for time alone. My pyrography tools are quite basic and cost me a tenner, but I wouldn't include them in resource charges. Instead, I might charge for the price of the wood used, in this case spruce softwood (I'm aware it's not the best type for my work, but I'm a broke student lol). This would be about £70. Finally, I find it hard to judge skill (self confidence issues yayyy) but I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to feature it as a 10% increase on the total so far. This produces an overall price of £242 ($324.38, 279.72 Euros) - not unreasonable for what it is. A quick glance around such as at Etsy would support this.

Let's apply that to an AI image and try to give it real, practical value. With a good graphics processor unit - not included in the charge in the same way my ten quid pyrography tool isn't - it can take 5-15 seconds to create a picture. But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say they weren't happy with this image, and it took them 10 tries. I found a sample prompt and typed it out myself. It took 59 seconds. They take maybe 10 seconds per rephrase. So:

59 + 9(15 + 10) + 15 = 299s. About 5 minutes, which equates to a value of 83p ($1.11, 0.96 Euro). 

Well, that's alright, isn't it? I'm sure the other two factors will boost the value - how much does resources add? 

Uhhh. It's free. Nothing of value added.

Hmm. How about creative skill and concept?

\-

I'm going to take a break here. Thus far I have told you why it doesn't have as much value as real art, but this point is where it becomes clear that it isn't art in the first place. Some people consider the creation of prompts to be a skill, and the reason it is real art. I am here to dispel that notion with a question: is an art critic an artist? 

Too often I see people stating that the writing of prompts is not of artistic value (true) only to be struck with the burning question of ""Well, what about writers and literature?"". The issue here is that this is a false equivalence. Writing is a standalone art form, and while some of it might be crap, it is still broadly art. The purpose it serves is its own existence. If I wrote a book and an image prompt and locked them both away until they're discovered after my untimely death falling from a castle parapet at the age of 49, one has value and one does not. The book has an arc, characters, structure, decisions that make it work on its own. The prompt is a description of a picture. If we're going to say the prompts are an artistic skill we may as well say that art critics are artists too, and (applying *reductio ad absurdum*) that the writers of instruction manuals for IKEA furniture must be great artists as well. 

Frankly, it should be obvious why writing is different to prompting.

\-

So, having established that the description of art is not in itself an artistic skill, the grand total of the value of this AI image stands at 83 of His Majesty's pence. Spiffing.

Oh dear. 

Putting aside all logical questions about why one would bother buying something that lacks any kind of visible human touch, we have now made it clear that not only is the creation of an AI image not an art form, but that it lacks practical value. Here is where the statements of the subjectivity of art roll in, usually followed by this example: 

https://preview.redd.it/k3brm5cspedf1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd42b4e297f9dc980f53b86533e9ffc589d02b75

Now, I propose that this is not a subjectivity of art issue, this is an economy issue, i.e. people have too much money and use it to buy mad status symbols. However, 'Comedian' does have the value of a great creative concept and a deeper meaning, taking advantage of the willingness of the rich buyer to purchase it and gaining meaning via the value placed on it, which puts it leagues ahead of AI images. That's all the time I'm willing to spend on this farce of an argument. 

Often, it is said that those who are anti-AI are Luddites who hate technology. This is bullshit, and those who make this claim are bullshitters, Boris Johnson-level bullshitters, the creme de la bullshitters, if you will. I'm not yet a digital artist, I am looking into it, but many of my friends are. I have dabbled in photography and naturally all my writing is done in Google Docs. I've made stop-motion films. All my composition is done either in Ableton or MuseScore Studio 4. I am no stranger to tech in art. The fact that myself and so many others like using tech but hate this tech specifically should tell you that it is not a tech issue. 

""But ThatAd,"" I hear them cry, as they do not know my name, ""when Photoshop came out, many said it didn't count as art either!""   
I have no rebuttal. I wasn't alive. If the debate managed to rage past 2007, I was likely chewing crayons. Or somesuch.

Here is the word that puts Photoshop in the category of real art, and AI images in the category of derivative bollocks: detail. 

If I scribble a stick figure on the notepad beside me, shitty as it may be, I have chosen the details. If I type out into Stable Diffusion ""stick figure"", what comes out is a stick figure, but most likely not the one I was picturing when I prompted. Drawing it gives it creative legitimacy, as I have control over what comes out. Notable, this does not exclude any real art forms. Photography? You control camera angle, lenses, focus, lighting, you choose when and where you take the photo and what you take it of. Writing? You pick the characters, the settings, the names, the arcs, every individual word is yours to manipulate. Music? You choose the chords, instruments, effects, melody, everything. 

It does not count as your art if you are unfamiliar with it when you receive the final result. It definitely does not count if all you receive is a final result.

When I am hunched over a block of wood in my spider-infested garage, burning away with what amounts to a big hot screwdriver, I control every line, every detail, and when the work evolves and concludes I know exactly what it looked like for each instance of its development. Sometimes it turns out different to expectation, but *I made it different*. The manual aspect is important. A painter knows every brushstroke of their piece, a composer knows every note, and a writer can see how every word they chose amounts to the whole.

It's not just a tool, it's a bastardisation of everything real artists stand for. We're not anti-fun, we're pro-accuracy and anti-being raw fucked over by this shite. And I'm rather sick of being asked to coddle the feelings of those who are upset that we don't think their machine-made ripoffs aren't as valuable as something real. You'll notice I didn't even go into the stealing aspect in this post, and that's because I'm more interested in delegitimising this first. 

In short, it's not your art if you didn't make it. And it's fucking worthless.",5,1752748076.0,antiai,4,0.78,False
