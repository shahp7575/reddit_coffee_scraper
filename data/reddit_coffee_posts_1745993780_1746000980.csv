1kbbafu,https://i.redd.it/oojvei3rkxxe1.jpeg,"Upgraded to ECM Classika ‚Äì Loving It, But One Quirk!","Hey everyone!

I recently upgraded from the Barista Express to the ECM Classika, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. The quality and consistency are next level!

What surprised me, though, is that after years of following brew ratios recommended on forums and YouTube, I actually get better-tasting coffee using the ratios from the ECM manual. Right now I‚Äôm pulling shots with 14g in and 50‚Äì60g out in 23‚Äì25 seconds. The result? Incredibly smooth and sweet coffee with none of the bitterness or harshness I used to struggle with. I'm genuinely impressed. I am using medium roast beans from Rwanda. 

However, there's one issue I could use some advice on:  
When I stop a shot (by pulling the lever back down), a¬†*lot*¬†of water spurts into the drip tray‚Äîso forcefully that it splashes out onto the counter. The same thing happens during backflushing. According to the gauge, pressure is at 10 bar during both brewing and backflushing (so about 9 bar at the group head, as expected).

Has anyone else experienced this? It seems odd for a ‚Ç¨1600 machine to make such a mess. Is there a fix or workaround?

Also, if you have any pro tips for dialing in espresso or maintaining the Classika long-term, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

I‚Äôd like to find someone grounded, emotionally present, and available to spend time in person. That‚Äôs it, really.

Someone calm, curious, open-hearted, and easy to be around. Someone who listens with the intention to understand, not defend. Someone steady, sincere, good to talk to or to sit in silence with, if that‚Äôs all the day allows.

What I‚Äôm hoping for is simple: two people being just a little more honest than usual.

Slow hours with someone kind across from me, in a conversation that isn‚Äôt measured in how clever it is, but how sincere. Talking without watching the clock, and leaving knowing something about them you didn‚Äôt expect.

You just have to be someone who‚Äôs gentle with other people‚Äôs feelings and can hold a conversation with care. That‚Äôs really what matters to me these days.

I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who also wants to be met with understanding because we all need somewhere safe to land every now and then. I just find emotional depth really enriching; there‚Äôs something quietly powerful about sitting with someone who‚Äôs willing to show you who they really are.

I don‚Äôt judge easily. I like it when people are honest, even when it‚Äôs messy.

We could get coffee, go for a slow walk, sit in a park, or find somewhere air-conditioned and comfortable to talk over a long meal. The plan matters less than the presence.

This isn't something I‚Äôm looking to build over weeks of texting or calls. I‚Äôm looking to connect in person because there‚Äôs a kind of understanding that only happens face to face: how someone holds themselves. What shifts in their eyes. How they settle into the moment when they feel safe. People soften differently when you‚Äôre with them. You can hear what someone means even when they stop speaking.

All genders welcome. This is strictly platonic. Not a placeholder and not something that might ever shift into romance, even quietly or eventually.¬†*Please don‚Äôt reach out if you‚Äôre looking for flirtation, subtle or otherwise.*

This will be mutual care and softness, offered openly, without shame. A good meal. A deep conversation. And the quiet reassurance of having been understood.

If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd also want, tell me a little about yourself.

1kbb4ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTax/comments/1kbb4ze/guide_for_indian_freelancers_exporting_services/,Guide for Indian Freelancers Exporting Services,"As a Chartered Accountant who consults many freelancers and independent contractors over the years, I've seen firsthand the confusion that taxation can create for those exporting services internationally. Let me share some insights from my experience working with clients in this space.

Understanding Your Tax Foundation

When I first meet with freelancers who work with international clients, I always start with a simple question: ""Do you understand your residential status for tax purposes?"" The blank looks I often receive tell me everything I need to know.

# The Residential Status Reality

Your entire tax structure hinges on this fundamental concept:

* If you stay in India for 182+ (i.e. 182 days or more) days during the financial year, you're considered a resident, making your global income taxable here.
* I once worked with a software developer who spent 6 months in Germany and thought his income earned there was exempt. He was shocked when I explained that as an Indian resident, he needed to report that income.

# The Business Income Classification

Over coffee last month, a content writer asked me why her freelance income wasn't considered salary. I explained that freelance income falls under ""Profits and Gains from Business or Profession"" - which actually opens up certain benefits but also creates specific obligations.

# The Presumptive Taxation Option: Section 44ADA

One of my most frequently used phrases during consultations is ""Section 44ADA."" Here's why it matters:

* For freelancers with gross receipts upto ‚Çπ75 lakhs in a financial year, this can be a game-changer.
* Under this provision, 50% of your gross receipts is simply deemed as your taxable income.
* Just last year, I helped a graphic designer who was maintaining elaborate spreadsheets of every coffee purchased during client meetings. I showed him how Section 44ADA could eliminate all that record-keeping while potentially saving him tax.

# Beyond the Presumptive Threshold

For those with receipts above ‚Çπ75 lakhs, I typically recommend more sophisticated tax planning strategies so better sit down with professionals. 

I remember a web developer whose business grew rapidly, pushing her beyond this threshold. We sat down for a comprehensive session where I outlined how structured planning could now offer more benefits than the presumptive scheme, despite the additional compliance requirements.

# GST Considerations for International Services

The GST questions always come up in my consulting sessions, and for good reason.

# The Export Advantage

""Is my service even taxable under GST?"" - this question comes up in almost every initial consultation.

* I explain that exports are ""zero-rated supplies"" under GST, which is excellent news.
* To qualify as an export, I tell my clients they need to ensure:
   * They're providing services from India
   * Their client is based outside India
   * They receive payment in foreign currency
   * They aren't just serving a different branch of the same company
* The LUT Approach in GST:

   * I generally recommend the Letter of Undertaking (LUT) route to my clients.
   * This allows them to issue invoices without charging GST, while still claiming input tax credits.
   * A digital marketing consultant I work with was amazed at how this improved her cash flow position.

# Managing Double Taxation

One of the most complex areas I help clients navigate is avoiding double taxation.

# The Double Taxation Challenge

I met with a software developer last week who was frustrated because both the US and India wanted to tax his  income. I walked him through:

* How India taxes global income for residents
* The relief mechanisms available when foreign countries deduct tax
* How to properly document foreign tax payments

# DTAA Benefits in Practice

""Can I really avoid being taxed twice?"" is a question I hear regularly.

* I explain to clients how India's tax treaties with various countries can protect them.
* Just last month, I helped a content writer understand how the tax credit method would allow her to offset taxes paid in the US against her Indian tax liability by claiming foreign tax credit.

# Banking and Invoice Best Practices

From my consulting experience, I've found that proper financial housekeeping prevents most tax problems:

* I always recommend separate business bank accounts for clear tracking.
* For a client who provides architectural services to European firms, I created an invoice template that:
   * Clearly marked ""Export of Services under LUT""
   * Included all required details for GST compliance
   * Specified currency conversion rates

# Conclusion

After consulting freelancers exporting services, I've found that understanding your tax structure early saves tremendous headaches later. The presumptive taxation scheme offers simplicity for many, while GST zero-rating provides valuable benefits for international service providers.

I remember a client who came to me after receiving a notice from the tax department. ""I wish I had met you a year ago,"" she said. We resolved her issues, but preventative tax planning would have been far less stressful.

Whether you're just starting your freelance journey or scaling your independent contracting business, getting the tax foundation right is essential for sustainable growth.

*Note: While I've shared insights from my consulting experience, tax laws evolve regularly. Always consult with a qualified tax professional for advice specific to your situation.*",1,1746000174.0,IndiaTax,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm dating to get married and I go on many first dates that are duds. I was on a first date yesterday with a guy I didn‚Äôt find attractive at all and found a little boring, but I though he might have a good heart. He turned his back to me and took two steps away when we order our coffees to show me he wasn‚Äôt paying for my coffee. I got all dressed up for the date and was all positive and polite and was treated like that‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom in dating.

If you wonder why I went on the date, it‚Äôs because honestly most men on the apps I find even a little attractive have many options and aren‚Äôt asking me out on dates when I tell them I don‚Äôt do casual.

The few guys I‚Äôve been interested in but who haven‚Äôt been willing to commit to me/been on different pages always ended things with saying that I deserve the best and that I will find my person soon because I‚Äôm amazing. Those last words warm my heart and I appreciate hearing that, but I‚Äôm starting to not believe in them anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm always the second best woman that don‚Äôt get chosen  for these men, that they are still searching for the best.

I always thought I would meet a man in the gym, but it feels like most men my age are taken and the few rest aren‚Äôt interested in talking to me even though I look friendly (just catching them checking out my body). I go to church and none of the men there try to talk to me. I‚Äôve tried talking to one guy and he gave me the cold shoulder.

I didn‚Äôt know it would be so hard to find love. Litteraly everyone around me has someone they love.

I woke up with a heavy heart today üíî Please can you give me encouragement to keep going on dates and give me hope back that I will find my person. Please tell me why I should keep going and that everything will end well.

Can you also please give me advice about how to know which men to approach in church and the gym and how to do it? Are there signs? I have a few times approached  guys that I have catched starting at me a lot but most times they aren‚Äôt interest (makes me confused). The ones that have been interested haven‚Äôt been interested in serious dating.

## What is Evoluci√≥n Fluxium?

Evoluci√≥n Fluxium is an **automated trading platform** that uses algorithms and real-time data to execute trades on your behalf. Basically, it‚Äôs your digital assistant in the chaotic world of online trading. It‚Äôs designed to scan the markets, identify potential profitable trades, and act on them‚Äîwithout you having to sit glued to your screen all day.

What makes it appealing is that it caters mostly to people who don‚Äôt have the time or experience to manually trade. You set your preferences, tweak a few risk management settings, and let it do its thing. Think of it like cruise control for your trading journey.

## Who Created Evoluci√≥n Fluxium?

This is where things get a bit murky. Like many platforms in this niche, **the creators of Evoluci√≥n Fluxium remain anonymous**. It‚Äôs not uncommon in crypto-land, but yeah, it would be nice to know who‚Äôs behind the curtain. What we do know is that it claims to partner with **regulated brokers**, and many of its features mirror those of platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which suggests it may be built on a similar framework.

That said, anonymity doesn‚Äôt always mean sketchy. A lot of solid crypto tools started that way. Still, transparency would definitely be a welcome bonus.

These algorithms analyze massive amounts of market data in real-time, looking for patterns or signals that suggest a good trade. Once it finds one, it executes the trade automatically through a connected broker.

You don‚Äôt need to write code or manage complex strategies. You just:

- Set your trading preferences (like risk level, asset types, etc.)
- Fund your account
- Let the bot do its thing

It‚Äôs not 100% hands-off‚Äîyou‚Äôll still need to monitor your account and tweak settings occasionally‚Äîbut it definitely reduces the heavy lifting. It also offers a **demo mode**, so you can test strategies without risking real money.

## Evoluci√≥n Fluxium Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs keep it real. No platform is perfect. Here‚Äôs where Evoluci√≥n Fluxium shines and where it could use some polish.

## Evoluci√≥n Fluxium ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of Evoluci√≥n Fluxium‚Äôs strongest features is its **AI-driven analytics engine**. It scans hundreds of markets in real-time and reacts quickly to price changes. This means it can potentially **capitalize on market volatility** faster than a human could.

### User-Friendly Interface

This isn‚Äôt some Wall Street-looking interface packed with jargon. The dashboard is **clean, modern, and intuitive**. Everything‚Äôs laid out in a way that even a first-time user can understand. Think Robinhood, but tailored for algorithmic trading.

- **Cryptocurrencies**
- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

This makes it a solid choice if you want to diversify your trading beyond just Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Is Evoluci√≥n Fluxium a Scam?

So, is this just another shady platform trying to steal your money? Based on my experience and user feedback, **probably not**.

1kbb34j,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1kbb34j/lifestyle_changes_impacting_genetic_quality_of/,Lifestyle changes impacting genetic quality of embryos?,"Hi lovely people. I‚Äôm struggling preparing for my 2nd ER after the first results and just wondering if anyone has any insight / experience with lifestyle changes impacting embryo quality from a PGT-A results perspective?

TLDR - prepping for ER2, cannot seem to manage strict lifestyle changes and confused to if a few more months of stricter changes will yield better results when genetic results are likely from age so that probably means go for ER2 ASAP. 


Our first ER results were 13 retrieved / 13 mature / 11 fertilised / 10 blastocysts (2 of which had ? about fertilisation) so 8 normal blastocysts and then 1 euploid. Our Dr is saying quality from a non genetic point of view is fantastic and the response and results for my age (39) are very strong with high maturity, good fertilisation and lots of beautiful embryos. Obviously there are genetic issues likely associated with age and I was disappointed to have such strong results at every step and then get the news that there‚Äôs only 1 at the end. 

My mental battle is - do I wait a few months and try harder with lifestyle changes (I‚Äôve struggled to completely eliminate coffee and sugar) but am on high protein diet, mostly really healthy food apart from 2/3 weak coffees a week and sweet things maybe 2/3 times a week. I‚Äôm on Coq10, prenatals, omega 3, magnesium, Vit D and trying to get really good sleep. Also doing acupuncture once a week and walking lots. Is a few more months of this more strictly going to make a big impact or considering it‚Äôs likely age, am I better to jump into ER2 asap? 

I‚Äôm struggling with these two opposing voices - ‚Äústop stressing about not doing it perfectly because stress is key‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre running out of time so why can‚Äôt you commit to this stuff 100% to give you the best possible chance.‚Äù

1kbb2by,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNoFap/comments/1kbb2by/i_just_got_the_best_advice_ive_ever_read_about/,I just got the best advice I‚Äôve ever read about this subject from asking Gemini 2.5 Pro,"I wanted to share it with my brothers and sisters in Islam. As some context, I wanted to first thank Anghel the Revert for his recent video about how childhood trauma is related to this addiction. 

Not just abuse, but also rejection, and general pain you haven't processed. This was a big realization for me. 

Now, the rest should be clear from the comversation itself. May Allah make it a means of benefit for all of us ameen. The really powerful part for me was the second response, but I'll include the first too for context.

Me: I noticed that porn cravings come when I feel low on dopamine and mentally sleepy or tired, how can I antidote this during the fact? 

Gemini: It's insightful that you've identified this connection between feeling low, tired, and experiencing porn cravings. This is a common pattern. When you feel mentally fatigued or low (which can feel like low dopamine ‚Äì seeking pleasure/reward), the brain can crave easy, high-stimulation activities like viewing pornography because it provides a quick, intense dopamine hit. However, this often leads to a cycle that doesn't address the underlying feeling and can have negative consequences.
Here are several strategies you can use in the moment when you notice this pattern emerging:
1. Change Your Physical State & Environment Immediately:
 * Move Your Body: Even brief, moderate physical activity can boost mood and energy.
   * Do 10-20 push-ups, jumping jacks, or squats.
   * Go for a brisk 5-10 minute walk, preferably outside in fresh air and sunlight if possible.
   * Stretch vigorously.
 * Cold Exposure: This can be surprisingly effective at snapping you out of a mental fog.
   * Splash cold water on your face.
   * Hold an ice pack briefly to your wrists or neck.
   * Take a quick cold shower (even 30-60 seconds can help).
 * Change Location: If you're in a place where you typically view porn (like your bedroom or at your computer), get up and go to a different room, preferably a more communal space like the kitchen or living room, or leave the house altogether.
2. Engage Your Mind Differently:
 * Connect Socially (Actively):
   * Call or text a friend or family member (not just passive scrolling). Have a real conversation.
   * If someone is nearby, strike up a conversation.
 * Do a Quick, Engaging Task:
   * Solve a puzzle (Sudoku, crossword, phone app game).
   * Do a quick chore you've been putting off (dishes, tidying a small area). The sense of accomplishment provides a different kind of reward.
   * Listen to upbeat, energetic music and focus on it.
   * Read an interesting article or a chapter of a book that requires focus.
 * Mindfulness/Grounding: Instead of seeking stimulation, ground yourself.
   * 5-4-3-2-1 Technique: Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste. This pulls you into the present moment.
   * Deep Breathing: Inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale slowly for 6. Repeat several times. Focus only on the breath.
3. Healthy Dopamine/Energy Boosts:
 * Hydrate: Dehydration can significantly contribute to fatigue and brain fog. Drink a large glass of water.
 * Nutritious Snack: Opt for something with protein or complex carbs, not sugary snacks which can lead to a crash. Fruit, nuts, yogurt are good options.
 * Caffeine (in moderation): If appropriate for you and the time of day, a cup of coffee or tea can help with alertness. Be mindful not to overdo it or consume it too late.
 * Sunlight: If possible, get some natural sunlight exposure, even for a few minutes.
4. Practice Urge Surfing:
 * Acknowledge the Craving: Mentally note, ""Okay, I'm feeling tired and having a craving for porn right now."" Don't judge it, just observe it.
 * Observe the Sensation: Notice where you feel the urge in your body. How intense is it? Recognize that cravings are like waves ‚Äì they build, peak, and then subside if you don't feed them.
 * Delay: Tell yourself you will wait 15 or 30 minutes before deciding whether to act on the urge. Often, by the time the period is up, the intensity will have decreased significantly, and you'll have had time to implement other strategies.
Key Considerations:
 * Identify the Real Need: Ask yourself: ""What am I really feeling or needing right now?"" Is it rest? Stress relief? Connection? Entertainment? Addressing the underlying need is more effective long-term than just suppressing the craving. If you're truly tired, maybe a short nap or planning for better sleep is the answer. If you're bored, finding genuine engagement is key.
 * Be Prepared: Have a list of these potential actions ready (mentally or written down) so you don't have to think too hard when the craving hits.
 * Self-Compassion: Don't beat yourself up if you slip up. Acknowledge it, learn from it (what triggered it? what could you do differently next time?), and refocus on your goals.
 * Professional Support: If these cravings are persistent, causing distress, or significantly impacting your life, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor specializing in behavioral addictions or compulsivity. They can help you develop more personalized strategies and address deeper underlying issues.
By having a toolkit of immediate actions ready, you can interrupt the cycle when you feel those specific triggers of fatigue and low mood, redirecting your energy towards healthier coping mechanisms.


Me: Let‚Äôs talk about how this is related to past trauma and how I might be able to deal with the cravings by processing past difficult experiences such as being rejected or deceived or abused or going through adolescence etc.

Gemini: Okay, that's a very important connection to explore. You're right, there's often a strong link between past difficult or traumatic experiences and the development of compulsive behaviors, including excessive pornography use. Understanding this connection is a crucial step toward healing and managing cravings more effectively.
Here's how past experiences like rejection, deception, abuse, or even the general turmoil of adolescence can relate to porn cravings and how processing them can help:
How Past Trauma/Difficult Experiences Connect to Porn Cravings:
 * Coping Mechanism for Unprocessed Emotions:
   * Traumatic or difficult experiences (rejection, abuse, betrayal) leave behind powerful, often overwhelming emotions: shame, fear, anger, sadness, emptiness, worthlessness, powerlessness.
   * If these emotions weren't processed healthily at the time (often because we lacked the tools, support, or safety to do so), they remain stored in the nervous system.
   * Pornography can become an easily accessible way to temporarily:
     * Numb: Drown out painful feelings or intrusive memories.
     * Escape: Create a fantasy world disconnected from painful reality.
     * Self-Soothe: Provide intense pleasure (dopamine) to counteract feelings of distress or emptiness.
     * Feel Control/Power: In fantasy, one can feel powerful or desired, counteracting past experiences of powerlessness or rejection.
 * Impact on Nervous System Regulation:
   * Trauma can dysregulate the nervous system, leaving you prone to states of hyper-arousal (anxiety, panic, restlessness) or hypo-arousal (numbness, dissociation, fatigue, depression - the ""low dopamine/mentally sleepy"" state you described).
   * Porn can be used compulsively to jolt the system out of hypo-arousal (seeking intense stimulation) or to dissociate/numb during hyper-arousal.
 * Attachment Wounds and Intimacy:
   * Experiences of rejection, deception, or inconsistent caregiving can create deep wounds around trust, intimacy, and vulnerability.
   * Porn can offer a substitute for genuine intimacy ‚Äì it provides sexual arousal and a feeling of connection (even if illusory) without the perceived risks of real relationships (vulnerability, potential for rejection or betrayal).
 * Core Beliefs and Self-Worth:
   * Abuse, neglect, or significant rejection often lead to internalizing negative beliefs like ""I'm not good enough,"" ""I'm unlovable,"" ""I'm dirty,"" or ""Something is wrong with me.""
   * Porn use can sometimes be tangled with these beliefs ‚Äì either as a way to seek external validation (feeling desired, even if by pixels) or, paradoxically, as a way to reinforce negative self-views (""See, I am bad/addicted"").
 * Adolescence:
   * This is a naturally tumultuous period involving identity formation, hormonal surges, intense social pressures, and heightened sensitivity to peer acceptance and rejection. Difficult experiences during this time (bullying, first heartbreaks, social exclusion, awkwardness) can establish patterns of using coping mechanisms like porn that persist into adulthood.
How Processing Past Experiences Can Help Reduce Cravings:
Processing trauma isn't about erasing the past, but about reducing its emotional charge and changing its impact on your present life. When done safely (ideally with professional help), it can significantly reduce the need to use porn as a coping mechanism:
 * Resolving Stored Emotions: Therapy provides a safe space to access, acknowledge, understand, and release the stored pain, fear, shame, and anger associated with past experiences. When these emotions are less overwhelming, the urge to numb or escape them via porn decreases.
 * Developing Healthier Coping Skills: As you process the past, you simultaneously learn healthier ways to manage distress, regulate your nervous system, and tolerate uncomfortable feelings without resorting to compulsive behaviors.
 * Healing Core Beliefs: Trauma processing often involves identifying and challenging the negative beliefs you internalized. Rebuilding self-worth and self-compassion reduces the underlying vulnerability that cravings often prey on. You start to believe you deserve better coping strategies.
 * Addressing Attachment Needs: Understanding how past experiences affect your current relationships and intimacy patterns allows you to work towards building secure, fulfilling connections in reality, reducing the reliance on fantasy substitutes.
 * Increased Self-Awareness: Processing helps you understand your triggers on a deeper level. You begin to recognize when a current situation taps into an old wound, and instead of automatically reaching for porn, you can identify the underlying feeling (""Ah, this reminds me of being rejected, and I feel shame"") and respond more consciously.
 * Reclaiming Agency: Trauma often involves a loss of control. The healing process helps reclaim a sense of agency over your own mind, body, and choices, empowering you to choose responses other than compulsive behaviors.
How to Approach Processing:
 * Professional Guidance is Highly Recommended: Processing trauma, especially abuse or significant rejection/deception, is complex and can be overwhelming or even re-traumatizing if done alone or incorrectly. Working with a qualified therapist trained in trauma-informed care is the safest and most effective approach.
 * Trauma-Informed Therapies: Look for therapists experienced in modalities like:
   * EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
   * Somatic Experiencing (focuses on bodily sensations linked to trauma)
   * Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)
   * Internal Family Systems (IFS)
   * Sensorimotor Psychotherapy
   * Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT - excellent for emotional regulation skills)
 * Patience and Safety: Healing is not linear. It takes time, courage, and requires establishing a safe therapeutic relationship.
 * Journaling (Carefully): Reflective journaling can be a helpful adjunct alongside therapy, but be cautious not to delve too deep into traumatic memories without support, as it can be destabilizing. Focus on connecting current feelings/cravings to potential past echoes.
 * Mindfulness and Self-Compassion: Practices that help you stay present and treat yourself with kindness are essential throughout the process.
In essence, by addressing the root causes (the unprocessed pain and learned coping patterns from past experiences), you reduce the fuel for the cravings. The cravings may still arise occasionally, but they likely won't have the same intensity or grip when the underlying emotional wounds are being tended to and healed.

I‚Äôd like to find someone grounded, emotionally present, and available to spend time in person. That‚Äôs it, really. 

Someone calm, curious, open-hearted, and easy to be around. Someone who listens with the intention to understand, not defend. Someone steady, sincere, good to talk to or to sit in silence with, if that‚Äôs all the day allows.

What I‚Äôm hoping for is simple: two people being just a little more honest than usual.

Slow hours with someone kind across from me, in a conversation that isn‚Äôt measured in how clever it is, but how sincere. Talking without watching the clock, and leaving knowing something about them you didn‚Äôt expect.

You just have to be someone who‚Äôs gentle with other people‚Äôs feelings and can hold a conversation with care. That‚Äôs really what matters to me these days.

I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who also wants to be met with understanding because we all need somewhere safe to land every now and then. I just find emotional depth really enriching; there‚Äôs something quietly powerful about sitting with someone who‚Äôs willing to show you who they really are. 

I don‚Äôt judge easily. I like it when people are honest, even when it‚Äôs messy.

We could get coffee, go for a slow walk, sit in a park, or find somewhere air-conditioned and comfortable to talk over a long meal. The plan matters less than the presence.

This isn't something I‚Äôm looking to build over weeks of texting or calls. I‚Äôm looking to connect in person because there‚Äôs a kind of understanding that only happens face to face: how someone holds themselves. What shifts in their eyes. How they settle into the moment when they feel safe. People soften differently when you‚Äôre with them. You can hear what someone means even when they stop speaking.

All genders welcome. This is strictly platonic. Not a placeholder and not something that might ever shift into romance, even quietly or eventually. *Please don‚Äôt reach out if you‚Äôre looking for flirtation, subtle or otherwise.*

This will be mutual care and softness, offered openly, without shame. A good meal. A deep conversation. And the quiet reassurance of having been understood.

If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd also want, tell me a little about yourself.

What do you miss? What are you still hoping for?

I wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone to care.

But someone did.

He messaged me at 1 a.m.‚Äî‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

Just that. No overthinking, no frills.
I didn‚Äôt reply for three days. But something about it stayed with me.

We started talking.
He was this sharp, funny, chaotic guy from Hyderabad ‚Äîquirky in the strangest ways. He talked about his broken past, the financial issues his family was dealing with , JEE failure , Emotional vulnerablity.
I listened and shared too.

We were nothing alike‚Äîhe was coffee, I was tea; he liked cats, I adored dogs. But in the strangest, quietest way, we fit. We met in that late-night space where everything feels a little more real and a little less filtered.
He made me learn Telugu even I wasn't interested enough.
Guy knew a hell lot of languages and I called that MLD(multiple languages disorder)

He joked about biryani and love and being ""emotionally bankrupt."" But somehow, I felt safe with him.
A guy who was better than my IRL friends.

Prolly the best yapper I have ever known.
A guy as funny as him doesn't exist.
Guy knew so much about science , history , philosophy and I miss that.
He had the weirdest emoji selections amd his texts made me laugh like anything.
An online standup comedian who had the power to light up your mood via texts.
I remember his long lecture on how I shouldn't consider smoking in college which I feel like sharing on reddit but it's way too long.


His JEE didn't go as planned and he knew he was kinda distracted.
We have known each other for more than 5 months.

After his JEE results , he vanished.
I don‚Äôt know what happened. Maybe he was overwhelmed. Maybe he was never meant to stay.
But for a while, because of that random Reddit message, I felt seen. I laughed like I hadn‚Äôt in months. I believed, just a little, that I wasn‚Äôt alone.

So who‚Äôs he? Honestly? A broken boy who probably meant it when he connected, but didn‚Äôt have the emotional bandwidth to sustain it. Maybe scared. Maybe overwhelmed. But real, even if temporary.


Just needed to let that out.

TL;DR-A few months ago, I posted on Reddit feeling overwhelmed with JEE prep and family pressure. Someone messaged me at 1 a.m. asking if I was okay, and even though I didn‚Äôt reply for days, we eventually started talking. He was a funny, chaotic guy from Hyderabad with a lot of emotional vulnerability and a quirky personality. We were very different, but in a weird way, we connected. We shared laughs, deep conversations, and random moments. After his JEE results, he vanished. I don‚Äôt know why, but for a while, he made me feel seen and not so alone.
And I miss him.

And some friendships do leave a remark on you.
It wasn't just a casual online friendship where people ghost after 20 days and he wasn't that kinda guy who ghosts I swear.

Time: 10:26 A.M.

Date: Feb. 35 2406

Location: Martian Frontier

Ares furrowed her brow. ‚ÄúHow much further are we going to go?‚Äù The next door opened suddenly, causing Ares to jump.

‚ÄúAs far as we need.‚Äù Adam replied, checking the next vacant hallway before slipping in.

‚ÄúHow are you sure this isn't a trap?‚Äù Ares clenched her fists slightly, her feet were getting tired. Even the lighter Martian gravity couldn't relieve the exhaustion of being bored on your feet for hours of the day. She scanned the area behind them with her eyes to check if they were being followed. They weren't.

‚ÄúThey would've killed us the instant they wanted. No need for mind games.‚Äù Adam popped his neck. The sound made Ares rub the back of her own.

Ares grunted under her breath, the sound swallowed by the corridor's oppressive quiet. She didn't like this place. Not one bit. The sterile perfection of the halls felt wrong, too clean, like a polished facade hiding rot underneath. The faint, sharp tang of antiseptic wasn't reassuring; it smelled like chemicals used to scrub away fingerprints, blood, and DNA. And the low mechanical whine... it wasn't just background noise. It vibrated up through the soles of her boots, a persistent thrum she could almost feel in the fillings of her teeth if she clenched her jaw too hard.

She'd tangled with Epsilon before, yes, but always from the outside looking in. Questioning tight-lipped employees in neutral territory, sorting through encrypted data logs from the relative safety of her desk back at the precinct. That had been manageable. Distant. Safe. This? Being inside the labyrinth, walking its silent corridors under the unseen gaze of... Someone‚Ä¶ This felt different. Exposed. Her mind, usually disciplined enough, started conjuring unwelcome scenarios, images flooding in with the relentless pressure of a breached hull. Were they being herded? Led deeper into the facility only to be cornered? What about the environmental controls, the air recyclers humming just out of sight?

It would be chillingly simple. Guide them to an isolated sector, seal the blast doors remotely, and flood the room. A whisper of aerosolized neurotoxin, maybe a fast-acting mycotoxin cocktail... clean, efficient, deniable. Especially if it broke down in the body. The thought traced an icy finger down her spine, a cold dread tightening her chest.

Ares flexed her fingers, trying to shake off the crawling sensation threading under her skin. Paranoia would get her killed just as quick as complacency. ‚ÄúIf I die here, I'm haunting you.‚Äù she muttered half-seriously.

Adam gave a small grunt that might‚Äôve been a laugh, or maybe just a cough. Hard to tell with him sometimes. ‚ÄúLong as you‚Äôre better company than you are alive, I‚Äôll take it,‚Äù he shot back under his breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll even set up a shrine. Fresh cigarettes and cheap whiskey every Thursday.‚Äù

Ares let a smirk flicker across her lips before it dropped away again. The next door ahead had already hissed open like the others, revealing another identical corridor stretching out before them.

The hallway ended at a set of double doors, matte black with a simple illuminated sign above: Storage Unit C. The lighting flashed rhythmically. Three short flashes followed by three long flashes followed by another three short flashes.

Adam's hand paused over the panel, the metal cool beneath his fingertips. The silence stretched, thick with the subtle vibration of the facility. ""You ready?"" His voice was low, scraped raw.

""Define ready."" Ares didn't waste movement. Her sidearm cleared its holster in one fluid motion, held low and steady.

Adam didn't wait for a better answer. A decisive tap, and the doors slid apart with a smooth, nearly silent hiss.

The air inside felt colder, heavy with the scent of antiseptic, and Ares faltered as her gaze swept over the unexpected layout.

Uniform rows of hospital beds stretched before her, each bed identical under its sterile white sheet. Attached to each setup, medical monitors methodically blinked in a monotone green.

She let out a slow breath, the sound brittle in the quiet room. ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs fifteen beds.‚Äù Just as the initial report had claimed.

‚ÄúYeah. Eight bodies missing too.‚Äù Adam responded, his demeanor shifted darkly as his eyes affixed to one particular bed in the room. His hands clenched tightly. Ares was sure she watched a few drops of blood dribble down his fists.

‚ÄúAdam?‚Äù Ares watched Adam long enough to know he wasn‚Äôt going to move, at least not at the moment.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ares muttered, stepping closer, careful not to spook him. Adam's brow was furrowed into a scowl as he stared at one of the bodies. Ares didn't even need to identify the body to know who it was. She could read the room, it'd be better to let him process the moment.

After a long, drawn-out moment, Adam shifted. Slow. Deliberate. He turned from the bed without a word, jaw so tightly set she half-expected to hear his teeth crack. He just took a deep breath in and let a shaky breath out. ‚ÄúAlright. Let's work.‚Äù He allowed himself to analyze the room until his eyes found the console on one wall. ‚ÄúAres, bypass drive. Console on the wall. Go.‚Äù Adam placed the bypass drive in her hand.

Ares nodded, accepting the bypass drive without a word. As Ares walked over to the console the wall, an LED flickered. Three short flashes, three long flashes, followed by a final three short flashes. Her hands moved with precision, plugging the drive into the console and tapping in the override sequence. ‚ÄúHeh. Even Epsilon‚Äôs security can't break my firewall smasher.‚Äù Ares allowed herself a moment of pride. The flickering light continued its pattern, slowly dimming with each repeat.

Adam's phone began to ring. As he checked, he saw that it was Bruce. Adam clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth before answering. ‚ÄúDetective Thourne speaking.‚Äù Adam had his phone on speaker phone so that Ares could be a part of the discussion if necessary.

‚ÄúNice work you two. Data has been received. Smart work sending it through an anonymous number.‚Äù This made Adam pause and Ares look over concerned.

‚ÄúAnonymous number?‚Äù Adam looked over at Ares. Ares' brow furrowed as she tilted her head. ‚ÄúAlright, thanks. We'll be back at the agency soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should probably go.‚Äù Ares pulled the bypass drive, shoving it into her pocket. She winced, knowing the static electricity of her pocket will probably kill it.

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Adam nodded, turning to walk back with Ares. But not before a final glance at Roseanne‚Äôs body. He paused, pulling the wedding band off of her finger, quietly pressing it against his lips. He muttered something too quiet for Ares to hear before placing it into his pocket.

Ares looked away, not quite sure what to say, but still just waiting for him. After a sentimental moment, Adam began to walk. ‚ÄúAlright. I'll look out behind us. You cover the front.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe front this time? You really trust me that much?‚Äù She snickered quietly to herself.

‚ÄúOh give me a break. I've got your back, you should be trusting me.‚Äù Adam sighed with a frustrated smirk.

They retraced their steps, following the path of empty corridors and hallways. The silver plated walls gently reflected the hum of an old fluorescent bulb that flickered subtly. She could swear she was able to hear the Martian sandstorm die down slightly.

‚ÄúStill don't know how the data was sent.‚Äù Ares broke the silence. Her posture stiffening as she looked around the next corner.

‚ÄúYou think the drive was spiked?‚Äù Adam raised an eyebrow before scanning the corridor behind them.

‚ÄúUnlikely. Though I can't deny, someone's helping us.‚Äù Ares pulled the bypass drive from her pocket as if to examine it.

‚ÄúWe can guess that they were already in the system before you plugged the drive in.‚Äù Adam stated calmly. ‚ÄúThe real question is who. We can assume the why. They're connected to the case. Perhaps a family member or connection to one of the victims.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe not that far, but it's a start.‚Äù Ares pursed her lips to one side, deep in thought. ‚ÄúYou thinking a PI?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. A private investigator isn't a bad idea, but, with 15 victims that leave 15 families and friend groups. That's too many people to send out a PI on.‚Äù Adam shrugged, stroking the stubble on his chin. ‚ÄúPerhaps we start with the board. Seems power might have influence, wouldn't you say?‚Äù

Ares paused before responding. ‚ÄúYeah. Seems about right. So, we send the PI on,‚Äù She looks at the data pad. ‚ÄúThompson.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶ Thompson? Of all people?‚Äù Adam let out a defeated groan.

‚ÄúHuh? What's wrong with Thompson?‚Äù Ares stifled a laugh with a question.

‚ÄúThompson is the reason why we're both on thin ice all the time. I don't know if it's because he doesn't like you, me, or himself.‚Äù Adam scoffed.

This left Ares with a bad taste in her mouth. ‚ÄúSo he's the reason I've been a trainee for five years?‚Äù

Adam chortled for a moment before breaking out into a chuckle. ‚ÄúPfft. No. Just part of it.‚Äù He patted her on the back, which caused her to jump. ‚ÄúJust because you're the first born on Mars, doesn't mean you're special.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we talk about something else now? I'm already bored outta my mind.‚Äù She rolled her eyes as she continued to walk.

‚ÄúYou kids and your attention spans I swear‚Ä¶‚Äù Adam huffed before continuing to speak, ‚ÄúWhat are you hoping for on the next shipment?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh that's a good one.‚Äù She looked up as if remembering the past shipments. ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ Maybe some more shrimp noodles. I'm almost out and the supply store hasn't sold them in a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't get your hopes up. February 42nd is just more bodies arriving. March 35th might have some freeze-dried rations, if the schedule holds‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúGod, I still struggle to keep these dates straight.‚Äù

‚ÄúPfft. You Earthlings and your ‚Äò365‚Äô day year.‚Äù Ares nudged Adam with her elbow.

‚ÄúOh come on. Don't even start with that.‚Äù Adam's whine was met with a mischievous laugh from Ares.

‚ÄúOh here we go with the ‚Äòback in my day, before the Martian colony was established.‚Äô heh.‚Äù Ares teased, ‚ÄúI know you're ancient, you don't have to preach it to the world.‚Äù

Running a hand over his chin, Adam let out a low grunt. ‚ÄúThe colony just turned 28,‚Äù he countered, his voice tight. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hardly ready for the retirement home, alright? Cut me some slack.‚Äù

Ares chuckled, shaking her head as they continued down the corridor, the rhythmic thump of their boots the only sound breaking the low hum. ‚ÄúAlright, alright, point taken, grandpa. Just try not to fossilize before we get back to the station.‚Äù

Adam grunted again, a sound somewhere between annoyance and grudging amusement. ‚ÄúJust make sure you file the report correctly this time.‚Äù He smiled slightly. ‚ÄúI still remember your first report.‚Äù His smile evolved into a devilish grin.

Ares scoffed, rolling her eyes dramatically. ""Oh, don't you dare bring up the coffee incident report. That was entrapment, and you know it.‚Äù

Adam chuckled, the sound rough but genuine this time. ""Entrapment? You filed a three page report on your own.‚Äù

""It was thorough!"" Ares protested, though a reluctant smile played on her lips. ""Attention to detail is key in our line of work.‚Äù

""Detail, yes. Overkill that makes Bruce avoid the coffee machine whenever you're near? Maybe not so much,"" Adam retorted dryly. He adjusted the collar of his jacket.

I‚Äôm quite new to the coffee scene.

For the longest time, I‚Äôve been drinking instant black coffee and assumed that coffee is just meant to taste bitter. 

someone suggested I try Davidoff.

So, I switched from Nescaf√© to Davidoff Rich Aroma and Espresso 57. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference‚Äîit still tasted the same bitter and flat to me.

Later, I came across brewing coffee and read something along the lines of ‚Äúinstant coffee is just bland and bitter; it lacks the flavors and notes that freshly brewed coffee has.‚Äù And thought maybe that was it?.

Last year, I ordered an AeroPress coffee from Third Wave Cafe via Swiggy. But again, I found it disappointingly bitter and couldn‚Äôt detect any unique flavors or notes people talk about.

So, I gave up on the idea that coffee could taste any better and just went back to my usual instant black coffee.

But recently, I saw the Blue Tokai ‚ÄúEasy Pour‚Äù sampler pack on Blinkit and decided to give it another shot. 

With one of the packs, I thought I noticed a slightly sweet aftertaste‚Äîbut that was about it. Beyond that, the coffee tasted like every other cup I‚Äôve had: just‚Ä¶ bitter.

So now, I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîhow do I develop my coffee palate?
I‚Äôve been reading up on coffee and am thinking of buying a French press and a Timemore Chestnut C2 grinder. But I‚Äôm hesitant. What‚Äôs the point of investing in good gear if I can‚Äôt even tell the difference between freshly brewed coffee and instant?

I‚Äôd really like to understand what people mean when they talk about flavor notes in coffee, and how to actually experience them.",1,1745999521.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

Hey Reddit,
I‚Äôve been flying solo for a few years enjoying my personal growth, solitude, and getting reacquainted with my inner child. It‚Äôs been amazing. Lately been feeling the nudge for comfort, connection, and companionship‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm stable and secure, active and fit, mentally and emotionally balanced, looking for similar. Appearance wise, I have petite features, long dark wavy hair, brown eyes, am 5‚Äô5‚Äù on the slender side, am most attracted to Caucasian men who are conventionally attractive and unconventionally calm, kind, and present. 

I‚Äôm sensitive to vibes so if you carry a lot of inner turmoil or life dissatisfaction, I understand (been there done that) but we will likely not be a good match. 

On the other hand, if you are steady and calm, kindhearted, self motivated, easy-going, self aware and non avoidant, with a sense of humor and the type that sees the ugly of the world but maintains a positive worldview, well we might just have a good time.

I‚Äôm down for most things‚Ä¶ archery, bowling, pickleball, SUPing, hiking, museums, restaurants and movies. Drugs, shrooms, cannabis are a turn off as I don‚Äôt partake in substances. Not a drinker, but don‚Äôt mind if you enjoy some beer, wine, or whiskey. I prefer tea, coffee, and kombucha myself.  I find great joy in the simple things like la dolce far niente and often grab a blanket and head to the park to lay in the middle of the field cloud watching or just dozing off listening to the birds.

My pet peeves are people who chew with their mouths open, curse a lot, or are pushy/arrogant.

1kbaxnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kbaxnk/theres_something_underneath_my_basement/,There's Something Underneath My Basement,"My name is Alex and as I write this, I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the RCMP find me. And when they do, they're either going to question me about why I burned my house down or take me, probably both honestly.

Right now I‚Äôm held up in the nearest hotel, not planning on going anywhere. I have barely slept and I don‚Äôt think I'm going to get much more sleep going forward.

They‚Äôre going to want answers and the truth is, I don‚Äôt have any good ones, none that makes any sense anyway. Hell, I don‚Äôt understand what happened myself. Their gonna think I‚Äôm insane or something but they can go look for themselves once the fire dies down and they can look down in that fucking hole in the basement.

Besides, how do I explain to them that I found another house beneath my basement?

It all started a couple of weeks ago when I found a property for sale while driving around. In this market, you don‚Äôt expect to find anything remotely affordable anymore, let alone a full house for $50,000. That alone should‚Äôve raised red flags, but it didn‚Äôt. I was too caught up in the price so much that nothing else mattered to me.

There was no online listing, no real estate agent, nothing. Just an old wooden sign staked in the front yard: *FOR SALE* scrawled in fading red paint, with a phone number beneath it. I called. The man who answered sounded old and told me it was for sale for $50,000. I bought it on the spot and spoke with him a little longer to arrange a day to purchase it.

I should‚Äôve known something was off from the start. But I didn‚Äôt, or maybe I did and chose to ignore it. I don‚Äôt know anymore.

It was tucked away near the end of an old, half-forgotten road where barely anyone lived anymore. The distance between each house made fences kind of pointless unless you REALLY needed privacy, just empty land with thin, scattered trees that looked more dead than alive. There were more shadows than people out there somehow.

The house itself was small. Tiny really, especially by modern standards. A little paperwork, a quick money transfer and suddenly, I was a homeowner. Well ‚Äúnew‚Äù owner at least. The place was old and worn, but I didn‚Äôt care. It was my house now.¬†

The man selling it was in his seventies, maybe older. Pale, wrinkled, like someone who hadn‚Äôt slept properly in months. He said he was heading to the East Coast to live with his family somewhere in Labrador. He told me his wife had passed away just a few months earlier. Found her one morning in the back garden. Dead, just lying there in the grass. He didn‚Äôt say how she died and I didn‚Äôt press him for details.

It wasn‚Äôt exactly the comforting image you want burned into your mind when buying a house, but still I had the deed and for the first time in my life, I owned something that wasn‚Äôt some shitty apartment I was renting for more than what it was really worth.

That night I drove over to pick up the keys from him. It was already late well past sunset and the road leading to the house was barely lit. Only a single streetlamp buzzed weakly near the edge of the property, casting just enough light to see the outline of the porch. The rest of the house was drowned in darkness. No lights on inside. Not even a glow from a window, just blackness inside.

The front door was slightly ajar hanging open like someone had left in a hurry. On the porch, right in front of the doorway the keys were sitting on the ground. No note or anything.

I bent down to pick them up and the moment my fingers touched metal something came rushing out towards me from the house, nearly knocking me to my ass from jumping back so quickly.

It was the old man.

He rushed out the front door fast, faster than I thought a man his age could move and walked straight past me without a word. Not even a glance in my direction. He had this wide, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he just did something wrong and got away with it. It was unnerving the way he smiled.

He didn‚Äôt stop either. He didn‚Äôt turn back to look at me or anything, just kept walking until he reached the other side of the road and kept walking further and further until he was out of sight in the darkness.

I stood there on the porch, keys in hand, trying to process what I had just watched until I couldn‚Äôt see the old man at all. I had no clue what was in that direction at all, an uneasy feeling overtaking me even when I glanced back to the house again with its front door wide open now, the pitch blackness inside haunting in its own way.

What got me the most was how tall the old man looked that night. He seemed taller than I remembered him being when we first met, almost unnaturally so. Maybe it was the night playing tricks on me or maybe it was just the sheer unease of that moment, the sight of him rushing past grinning ear to ear in the dark, that had scared me more than anything at the moment when I saw him rushing past me. I never saw him again.

It took a few days before I was fully moved into the house. There were the usual chores of changing the locks, bringing in the essentials, trying to make the place feel like mine by placing furniture and photo‚Äôs everywhere. It may have looked small from the outside, but the house had a deceptive amount of space. Two modest bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, a tight but functional living room, and even a pull-down ladder that led to a shallow attic you had to crouch in to move around. But what really surprised me was the basement. The stairs creaked with each step you took but they led down into a massive, open space about the size of the entire footprint of the house above it. It was dark, musty, and smelled faintly of damp stone and old wood, but it had potential.

Like the rest of the place, it needed work. The exterior was in rough shape, yellow paint flaking off in long strips, roofing shingles cracked and curling in spots, the kind of damage that only years of sun, wind and neglect would do to them over time. Still, with how little I spent on the place I had enough saved to start making improvements. I wanted to build something for myself finally.

It was only two days ago that everything changed.

It had been raining hard all day, the kind of steady yet heavy, cold rain that soaks through everything it touched. I was heading down into the basement to grab a toolbox when I noticed nearly two feet of water at the bottom of the staircase.

I looked around for the source, expecting to find a burst pipe or a window left open, but there was nothing I could see that was letting the rain water in.

I scrambled to collect the buckets, pans, even plastic bins, anything I could use to start scooping water into to help fight the rising water. I‚Äôd scoop up what I could, run it outside, and toss it far from the house, only for the water level to rise again when I came back. It was a losing battle yet I had to keep trying, the last thing i needed was my entire basement filled with water and reach the top of the staircase..

On my sixth trip down there, something gave.

As I was rushing to the bottom of the stairs I heard a sound, a deep, hollow like sound, like wood giving way under pressure. Then, all at once, the water began swirling, spiraling toward the center of the basement like in a sink once the plug was pulled. It drained quickly, all of the water rushing downwards until all of it was gone, leaving behind a single hole dead center in the basement.

It was no bigger than my fist¬† right in the middle of the floor. I waited for the last of the water to vanish before approaching it with caution. My first thought was it was an old floor drain. Maybe it had been blocked for years and finally gave way once there was enough water down here, but when I shined my phone‚Äôs flashlight into it that idea died pretty quickly.

There was no pipe, no grating, no rusty metal or broken pipe, just a black void in the center of my basement floor. The dirt and cement around the edges were rough yet round at the same time, maybe a collapse but it was level with the floor somehow.

The closer I got to it to look, the weirder it started to get.

With my phone‚Äôs flashlight, I could just barely make out what looked like... another floor beneath me, far far below. Was it a second basement? Another room? I had no clue what the hell I was looking at at that moment.

I wanted to know more. I *needed* to. But making the hole bigger was a risky move. If the foundation was as old and brittle as the rest of the house, I could bring the whole damn floor out from under me, hell I could even make the house collapse over me. Okay maybe not that last bit but you get my point.

At the same time there was absolutely nothing I could do at the time being. The rain water was gone thankfully but until tomorrow no one was going to be swinging by and checking it out for me, not until tomorrow at least.

Worst case scenario, I figured I could grab a piece of plywood, cover the hole, and pour concrete over it, that would seal the damn thing off and pretend it was never there. Not a perfect fix but at least it would keep the basement from collapsing under me‚Ä¶hopefully.

When the morning came I stepped outside to inspect the house for any more damage from the storm before finally making my way back down to the basement. I was expecting the hole to still be there. What I wasn't expecting was the hole to be much bigger now overnight.

What was once the size of my fist was now easily large enough for a grown man to jump through. No digging or tools required for the job, just a clean, dark opening in the middle of my basement floor. Looking down into it again I could finally confirm what I thought I‚Äôd seen the day before, a wooden floor much deeper down then I thought originally. There even seemed to be boxes down there as well

Even if I wanted to go down there the drop was too far. There was no way I‚Äôd be able to climb back up if I just jumped down there. Hell I would probably bust my leg up just jumping down there, the only way to safely reach the bottom was with a ladder. So I got one.

I drove to the nearest hardware store and bought the longest extension ladder they had, along with a decent flashlight, something stronger than what my phone's flashlight could handle. When I got back I carefully lowered the ladder into the hole, extending it as far as it would go until it finally touched the bottom. The very top of the ladder barely grazed the stone floor below. If the floor it leaned on gave out while I was climbing down I would for sure fall and probably break something along the way.

I took my time descending step by step, testing each one with my full weight before committing to the next. The moment my feet touched the bottom, I realized how strange the air felt. Warm and dry, too dry for a space underground that had just flooded.

I flicked my flashlight to look around the room, the shape of it was off somehow.

The wooden walls rose upward at a sharp angle, forming a triangular space that immediately struck me as familiar. I turned slowly as pieces started clicking in my head. ‚ÄúThis looks just like my attic‚Äù I remember telling myself, only it was taller and almost thinner on the sides in a weird warped kind of way.

Even the boxes down here looked similar to the ones I had in the attic only stretched into more odd shapes. Inside the boxes though was nothing but crumpled up paper and old splintered wood that smelt like they were decaying for a while. It wasn‚Äôt long before i spotted the pull down staircase like in my actual house.

I hesitated at first before yanking it free and carefully descended once more, my flashlight flicking around in my hand as I stepped lower and lower into this house under my basement.

The darkness swallowed¬† me as I entered the hallway.

I was standing in what looked like my own living room, almost exact to my living room. Same furniture, same shitty worn down rug, the same family photos hanging on the walls. The photos were wrong though, stretched in a way that it was like someone editing them used a tool to stretch them taller and thinner without adjusting them to look right..

The pictures with myself in them scared me the most.

All of the photo‚Äôs with myself standing in them made me look off in so many ways, it was the only part of any of the pictures that looked proper within them, yet I look monstrous in them. I looked taller but thinner, my eyes wide and a huge grin smeared across my face in an almost impossible way. It scared me a little to look at them.

I moved toward the kitchen, stepping lightly as I did. The air felt still and heavy, it was like no one had been down here in ages yet everywhere I look things I had in my own house were place perfectly where I left them, the kitchen was a perfect sight of this with a plate and fork left in the sink, and a coffee pot left on the counter from this morning. The kitchen was just as distorted, tall counters and oversized cabinets. Two impossibly thin chairs that looked exactly like what I had but scaled like props in some surreal movie scene. I would have had to jump to sit on them and even then I‚Äôd probably snap them like twigs from doing it.

There were windows but instead of letting in light they were filled with dirt and stone, the dirt pressed right up to the glass. No sunlight could reach this far underground, but the lights overhead‚Ä¶ they looked intact despite their oddly stretched design.

I stepped to one of the light switches and flicked them up.

For a split second¬† the bulbs flashed with an intense light, revealing just how wrong everything was. The sudden light flash made the bulbs pop loudly and killed them in an instant. Within that brief moment of light I thought I saw something at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.

The light was on and gone so quickly I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was, but it was tall, unbelievably tall as it stood there staring at me.

I quickly raised my flashlight down the hallway, the beam bouncing wildly off the walls. I could‚Äôve sworn I saw something, someone even standing there. I froze, heart pounding, eyes locked on the place where it had been as my hands shook holding the flashlight. My mind raced to make sense of it, where the hell it even came from, but it came up empty. Panic started to creep in as I backed into the kitchen counter with my hand blindly searching for anything to use, it landed on the handle of a kitchen knife. It was long and thin, barely more than a glorified machete then a knife, but it was the only thing between me and whatever might be waiting on the other side of the hallway.

I stepped forward slowly, each foot step echoing too loudly on the warped wood. The silence was thick like the house itself was holding its breath as I moved through it. I inched my way to the end of the hallway, ready to fight whatever the hell was over there only to find nothing, nothing at all.

Did my eyes play tricks on me with the sudden flash of light?

I stood there for what felt like forever trying to calm myself, trying to make sense of what I‚Äôd seen while searching every inch of the living room for anything at all. There was nothing, nothing except for one more room in this messed up house.

The basement.

Every piece of me screamed at me to not go down. God only knows what the hell was waiting for me down there, yet I needed to see now, I had to see what was down there.

I took my time, descending the narrow staircase little by little. I reached the basement floor of the second house and there, right in the center of the basement floor was another hole. And this time a ladder was already in place. Almost identical to the one I had used earlier. As if someone, or something, had placed the same one for me. What if it was there because I placed my ladder to reach down here?

The hole was much wider than the last one as I stepped closer to it. It was wider yet the attic I was looking into this time was much shorter then this one, maybe shorter than the one I actually owned on top..

This time though, nearing the edge the smell hit me harder than anything else. The stink of rotting wood and something sour and organic, made my stomach twist and turn a little. I covered my nose with my sleeve and leaned over shining my light into the pit. The space below glistened under the beam. Everything looked wet, drenched in something thick that shimmered like oil.

Maybe this was where the rainwater had drained. But that didn‚Äôt make sense, this second house would have soaked it up before it even reached the basement, hell whatever was down there didn‚Äôt look like it was soaked in water at all, more slime or mold.

My curiosity got the best of me as I began climbing down, ignoring every desperate plea my brain tried to make me stop. This house, the third one, was the opposite of the last. Where the second house was tall and thin, this one was short and wide. I had to crawl on all fours just to move around down there and the smell, oh god the smell was so bad. The attic ceiling was pressed downwards, forcing me to crawl to the pulled up staircase before I was free from it.

The air was thick and wet down here, covering my face was out of the question now with my arms drenched in whatever the hell this was as everything had a thin layer of mold or slime or‚Ä¶whatever the fuck it was, making my steps a little more slippery. I was in the hallway now, forcing me to dip my head slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling. The walls were stretched outward now, wide and bloated. Warped like something swollen from the inside.

Again everything was where it should‚Äôve been to the layout of my actual house. My furniture, my photos. But this time the distortion wasn‚Äôt just in shape. It was *texture*. The air smelled of mildew and decay. the furniture sagged. The floor squelched slightly beneath my feet and the photos were awful. My face was bloated and discolored. My eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of my face swelled over them like I was infected by something.

I made my way toward the final staircase, the one leading down to the basement and I heard it.

Breathing.

Slow, ragged, wet, a rattle of the throat like it was trying to clear something deep in its throat.

The sound grew louder with every step. It wasn‚Äôt just breathing, it was struggling with every breath it took like it was trying to stay alive. In a way it sounded like water was lodged in their lungs and every breath rattled it around in a sickening manner.

I descended carefully each step louder than the last, a slight squishing sound to go with them from the mold beneath my feet as I reached the bottom step, seeing the basement floor finally.

Someone or something was standing there, standing over what looked like another hole dead center to the basement.

It was hunched, shorter than me for sure. Its back was to me, looming over the other hole in the floor. Its body looked swollen and damp, its skin pale and blotchy, and its head¬† too big for its frame. The gurgled wheezing echoed off the walls as it shifted slightly.

Then it turned, its step made him jiggle just a little bit.

What I saw was‚Ä¶me, but it wasn‚Äôt me at the same time.

Its face was bloated and discolored, its eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of its face swelled over them. Its mouth slack and drool hangs in thick strands from its bloated lips. Its shirt was identical to mine, soaked and clinging to its sticky body, its eyes barely registered my presence at first.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck...‚Äù I whispered, the words barely escaping my throat as I looked at whatever the hell this was in front of me.

It let out a sickening noise, a cross between a gargled yell and a cough. Its whole body shuddered before it started to move towards me, moving faster than I expected it to move.

Each step made its bloated skin shake from its footsteps, the bloated parts nearly covering its eyes shifting to its weight and gravity.

My body told me to run, run and don‚Äôt look back, my boots slipping across the slime coated floors as I scrambled up the staircase in a mad panic to get away from it. The gunk clinging to the surfaces and making every step a risk, I could barely keep traction.

I launched myself onto the pull down staircase as fast as I could, dragging myself upward on all fours like a scared animal clawing its way out of a trap. Behind me I heard the wet, slapping sounds of it following, its hand reaching up from the pull down staircase leading to the attic already. I felt fingers swipe at my ankle, slick and sticky but they slid off just as I hauled myself forward and to the hole in the attic

I could hear my own heartbeat ringing in my ears, my body buzzed with adrenaline and a blind panic coursing through every nerve in my body. That thing, that twisted, bloated *version* of me was chasing me and somehow catching up. I didn‚Äôt dare to look back, not wanting to see that thing catching up to me in any way.

If I can get to my actual house and pull the ladder up, I could prevent it from reaching me, no way for it to be able to climb up that distance I hoped. I was in the second house now, out of breath but I could still hear it following me as I raced to the staircase, reaching the hallway once again and climbing up the pull down staircase again. I was nearly out of there as I stood in the attic for a second.

I grabbed the ladder and started to climb like a mad man, reaching only half way up the ladder before I felt its hand grab me by the leg.*.* The entire ladder lurched in my hands, its weight suddenly doubled from the thing joining me on it. It held on to my leg, trying to pull me down with it as I struggled to keep a grip on the latter, my hands still slick with the third floor's slop.

I didn‚Äôt stop to fight it. I ran. I sprinted across the attic floor to the next pull-down staircase, yanked it open, and threw myself onto the steps, climbing as fast as my legs would carry me. The wood groaned beneath my weight. My fingers slipped on the wet rungs. I could hear the creature scuttling after me, faster than anything that heavy and bloated should‚Äôve been able to move.

His hands were cold and rubbery, coated in something viscous that immediately soaked through my jean leg. It yanked hard, trying to drag me back down with it. I tried to pull away, holding on to the ladder the best I could, my other foot flailing around and trying to get back on to one of the steps of the ladder. The thing below snarled, breath bubbling like it was choking on vomit as it finally spoke out words I could understand.

‚Äú*Deeper...* DEEPER*!*‚Äù it gurgled, its voice broken and wet like it was speaking through a throat full of sludge.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me!‚Äù I shouted.

I twisted violently trying to break free and kicked down with my free foot aiming blind. I struck the left side of its face, my foot nearly sticking to its face as I raised it up again and brought it down on him again and again.

‚ÄúDeeper!‚Äù It screamed at me before my foot smashed it in the jaw, a loud crack coming from my foot smashing into it again. With one final kick I felt the left side of his face give, almost like a grape being stepped on as the skin cracked open underneath my foot and his grip suddenly loosened as it fell to the floor beneath with a wet splat like a water balloon. The entirety of the left side of its face was broken up, gushing out blood and whatever fluids was stored inside of its body as it poured out around it, its body twitching as it laid on the floor beneath me.Looking down at it, a part of me wanted to make sure it was dead. Instead I pulled myself up into my actual basement, pulling the ladder up with me to make sure nothing else could come climbing up.

I didn‚Äôt know what the hell to do. My mind was on fire, spiraling on what I just witnessed, trying to make sense of what I had seen, what I had just killed*.* There were no answers that made any sense, just more questions piling up and clawing at the edge of my sanity. But through the noise, one thought cut through with terrifying clarity. What if something else could crawl up here? It may have been the panic I was in, it might have been the thought of more fucked up versions of me could be lingering down there, but in the end i decided to burn the place down with whatever I had on hand.

If nothing existed up here then there shouldn‚Äôt be anything down there right? It mirrored my home in every way before twisting it and making whatever the hell I just saw down there. It was the only thing that seemed to make sense in my mind at that moment.

I tore through the house grabbing anything flammable. Paper, lighter fluid, cans of spray, I even thought about getting gas from the tank of my car to pour everywhere but I would need it to get the hell out of here. The smell of chemicals filled the air, sharp and burning my throat as I spread everything I had everywhere. I didn‚Äôt care about damage or cost or consequence anymore, this house was cursed with things I couldn‚Äôt understand

I stood in the center of the living room for a moment as I readied the matches, my fingers trembling to get one of them lit before throwing it down, flames shooting up everywhere very quickly before I rushed out the door.

As the flames rushed through the house I made my way out the front door that somehow was already wide open. I didn‚Äôt remember leaving the front door open at all but I shook that thought out of my head as I ran to the car, igniting the engine to get the hell out of there as flames engulfed the house. I let the house burn behind me, never once looking back at it as I drove as fast and I could out of there like a bat out of hell. Looking back it now I could have done so many different things like call the police and have them see the hole for themselves and whatever fucked up thing was down there waiting for them, but as it stands I could care less now. I should be upset with burning my home down but I don‚Äôt, I really don‚Äôt after all of that.

I‚Äôve been at this cheap hotel ever since, holed up in a room that smells like old wallpaper and cat piss. I haven‚Äôt slept or eaten much, my stomach just turns whenever I think of the third house down there.

My mind keeps going back to when I found that‚Ä¶thing in the basement, it was looking at another hole dead center of the basement. There was another house down there, maybe more messed up then the third one and who knows how many more beneath that one.

What bothered me even more was the fact that the third house had a messed up version of me, was there one for the second floor or did I get lucky? I thought I saw something but I looked everywhere when I was down there and spotted nothing but what if I missed it somehow?

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll probably never find out now and honestly, maybe that‚Äôs for the best.

Anyway, I‚Äôm done writing about this. Just trying to keep my head on¬† straight while I wait for the RCMP to show up. They will come eventually.

Someone is knocking on my door so I‚Äôm gonna see who it is. Whoever they are, I can see their shadow in the window and they are tall as hell.

Hey Reddit,
I‚Äôve been flying solo for a few years enjoying my personal growth, solitude, and getting reacquainted with my inner child. It‚Äôs been amazing. Lately been feeling the nudge for comfort, connection, and companionship‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm stable and secure, active and fit, mentally and emotionally balanced, looking for similar. Appearance wise, I have petite features, long dark wavy hair, brown eyes, am 5‚Äô5‚Äù on the slender side, am most attracted to Caucasian men who are conventionally attractive and unconventionally calm, kind, and present. 

I‚Äôm sensitive to vibes so if you carry a lot of inner turmoil or life dissatisfaction, I understand (been there done that) but we will likely not be a good match. 

On the other hand, if you are steady and calm, kindhearted, self motivated, easy-going, self aware and non avoidant, with a sense of humor and the type that sees the ugly of the world but maintains a positive worldview, well we might just have a good time.

I‚Äôm down for most things‚Ä¶ archery, bowling, pickleball, SUPing, hiking, museums, restaurants and movies. Drugs, shrooms, cannabis are a turn off as I don‚Äôt partake in substances. Not a drinker, but don‚Äôt mind if you enjoy some beer, wine, or whiskey. I prefer tea, coffee, and kombucha myself.  I find great joy in the simple things like la dolce far niente and often grab a blanket and head to the park to lay in the middle of the field cloud watching or just dozing off listening to the birds.

My pet peeves are people who chew with their mouths open, curse a lot, or are pushy/arrogant.

1kbaumc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1kbaumc/can_cinnamon_lower_blood_sugar/,Can cinnamon lower blood sugar?,"That was the exact question I typed into Google after my doctor told me I was ‚Äúon the edge‚Äù of prediabetes. My A1C had crept up to 5.9%, fasting glucose was sitting around 102, and I was starting to feel those post-meal crashes a bit too often. I wasn‚Äôt ready for medication, so I started looking into natural options‚Äîincluding cinnamon.

Turns out, **cinnamon has been studied** quite a bit for its effects on **blood sugar regulation**, especially post-meal spikes. It seems to help improve insulin sensitivity and slow the breakdown of carbs in the digestive tract. But like anything in the health world, the devil‚Äôs in the details‚Äîhow much cinnamon, what kind, and whether it‚Äôs actually effective on its own.

I eventually came across a supplement called **Glyco Boost** that includes **Cinnamon Bark Powder** as one of its ingredients, along with several others that target **insulin resistance** and **glucose control**. After reading a bunch of **glyco boost reviews**, I decided to give it a full 3-month run to see if combining cinnamon with other ingredients would actually make a difference.

**Does cinnamon work by itself?**

Yes‚Äîand no. Some research suggests that **Ceylon cinnamon**, in particular, can help reduce fasting blood sugar and improve post-meal glucose control, but the results vary from person to person. I tried adding it to oatmeal, smoothies, coffee‚Äîyou name it‚Äîbut never noticed a huge difference on its own.

It wasn‚Äôt until I tried a **glyco boost supplement** (which includes cinnamon along with **Berberine**, **Bitter Melon**, **Chromium**, and **White Mulberry Leaf**) that I started to see more stable numbers.

Here‚Äôs where I got my info about the full formula if you want to dig in:  
[**GlycoBoost Ingredients & Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JF3QLZ5/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**My results after using GlycoBoost (with cinnamon)**

**Week 1‚Äì2:**  
Felt no major changes, but no negative **glyco boost side effects** either. My energy felt a little more even, especially in the afternoons.

**Week 3‚Äì5:**  
Fasting blood sugar started trending downward‚Äîfrom 102 to around 95. I didn‚Äôt change much in my diet, but I was walking daily and staying consistent with the capsules.

**Week 6‚Äì8:**  
Blood pressure came down slightly. I also noticed fewer sugar cravings in the evening, which had been a big problem for me. Cinnamon might have played a role in helping regulate insulin response, but it was clearly working better as part of a combined formula.

**Week 9‚Äì12:**  
Final result: A1C dropped from 5.9% to 5.5%, and I lost about 7 pounds without extreme dieting. Blood sugar stayed between 88‚Äì93 most mornings. I felt more steady‚Äîphysically and mentally.

Here‚Äôs the link I used to read up on GlycoBoost before starting:  
[**Explore GlycoBoost Supplement Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JF3QLZ5/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**So, can cinnamon lower blood sugar?**

In my experience, **yes‚Äîbut not dramatically on its own**. It seems to work best when paired with other natural compounds that support metabolic health. That‚Äôs where **GlycoBoost benefits** became clear‚Äîit takes the blood-sugar-supporting properties of cinnamon and combines them with ingredients that target insulin resistance, cholesterol, and even mild weight issues.

If you‚Äôre dealing with fluctuating glucose, borderline A1C, or just curious about natural ways to stabilize blood sugar, cinnamon is a decent start‚Äîbut combining it with other proven ingredients may give you better results.

Anyone else here tried GlycoBoost or a cinnamon-based supplement for blood sugar? Would love to hear what worked for you.

1kbat0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salt-Net4585/comments/1kbat0q/the_night_the_lights_came/,The Night The Lights Came,"(Full- revised story- based on a dream)


‚Äî‚Äî
I sat alone on the porch, watching the sky like it owed me something.
It had been three nights since the lights started appearing. Always the same: red, hovering in a line like silent sentinels before vanishing at impossible speed. Everyone in town had seen them‚Äîneighbors, coworkers, even Matt. I‚Äôd only caught the tail end of a streak once, but that wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed to see it. I needed proof.
So tonight, I waited.

The air was heavy with late summer stillness. Cicadas hummed lazily in the trees, and the scent of cut grass clung to everything. The house behind me‚Äîour house‚Äîwas quiet. It looked like home, but something felt rearranged inside, like furniture had been nudged just slightly off its usual marks.
I set the camera on the porch railing, pointed toward the northern sky, and hit record. It gave off a faint mechanical whir as the lens focused. I adjusted the tripod, stepped back, and lowered myself onto the top step.

The moment I sat, the lights appeared.
Five red dots blinked into view, unmoving. My breath caught in my chest. They weren‚Äôt planes. They weren‚Äôt stars. They held a stillness that felt deliberate‚Äîwatched. Then they shattered apart like breaking glass, zipping overhead in a scatter formation that moved faster than anything should.
If I‚Äôd blinked, I would‚Äôve missed it.
‚ÄúI saw them that time,‚Äù I whispered.
That‚Äôs when the light came.
White. Consuming. Like standing inside a sunbeam turned solid. It didn‚Äôt just blind me‚Äîit entered me, wrapped itself around my lungs, pressed behind my eyes. The porch vanished. The sky. The ground. My skin.
I was nowhere. And not alone.

‚Äî‚Äî

I couldn't move.
Not even the tiniest twitch of a finger or blink of an eye. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I still had eyes. My body was a vague suggestion‚Äîan echo of shape without weight. I was untethered, yet suspended, like thought floating in syrup.
Sound came next.
Muffled voices, layered and out of sync, speaking in tones that made my ears want to fold in on themselves. No language I knew‚Äîbut the rhythm felt intentional. A call and response. Question, answer. Command.
Then the metallic noises began: low, vibrating clangs like steel under pressure, followed by the wet clink of glass or ceramic. Beeping tones pulsed at odd intervals, sharp and sterile. I tried to scream. To move. To be.
Nothing.
Only the thunder of my heartbeat, if it even was mine. It felt distant. Foreign. Like someone else was thudding inside my ribs.
I began to panic. Not a normal panic, not the kind that frays your nerves and makes your limbs shake. This was deeper. Primal. A suffocating terror that felt like drowning in thought. I flailed, mentally, psychically‚Äîspiritually. My will surged outward, screaming against invisible walls.
And something responded.
Not in words.
But in pressure.
Something pressed back.
And then‚ÄîRelease.

‚Äî‚Äî

I blinked.
Or maybe the world blinked me.
Suddenly I was back on the porch. Morning light spilled over the yard like nothing had happened. Birds chirped. A truck rumbled in the distance.
My skin was damp with dew. My joints ached. And there was a blanket on my lap.
I hadn‚Äôt brought it out.

‚ÄúLeecy?‚Äù
Matt‚Äôs voice. From behind me.
I turned my head too fast and the world tilted. He stood in the doorway, brow furrowed.
‚ÄúWere you asleep out here?‚Äù
I opened my mouth, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat was dry. Raw. My vision swam. His face was blurry, edges hazy like I was underwater.
‚ÄúHelp‚Ä¶‚Äù I croaked. My voice was a stranger‚Äôs.
Matt took a cautious step forward. ‚ÄúYou okay? You were‚Ä¶ kicking. Swinging. I tried to wake you up earlier, but you were yelling at me. Said ‚Äòno‚Äô over and over.‚Äù

He paused, his voice colder now.
‚ÄúI told you, if you started that again, I‚Äôd go back inside.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I rasped. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ help me‚Ä¶‚Äù
My legs barely worked. My whole body trembled, unresponsive and sluggish, like I'd been dropped back into it from somewhere else. He took my arm, helped me to my feet. I stumbled inside, leaning hard on him, and crashed against the pillar in the living room before collapsing onto the couch.
Matt looked calm. Too calm.
Like this had happened before.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out there‚Ä¶ since last night,‚Äù I managed.
He glanced over his shoulder, squinting slightly. ‚ÄúSince last night?‚Äù
He turned, walked back outside to grab the blanket.
I stared after him.
That blanket.

‚Äî‚Äî

Matt came back inside with the blanket folded neatly in his arms.
Too neatly.
He laid it across the back of the couch like it was just another morning, like I hadn‚Äôt just told him I‚Äôd been missing all night.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out there since last night,‚Äù I said again, louder this time. Desperate.
He paused for half a second‚Äîthen nodded, slow and thoughtful, like he was mentally filing the information away under Things That Are Not a Problem.

He didn‚Äôt ask why I hadn‚Äôt come in.
Didn‚Äôt ask what I saw.
Didn‚Äôt ask about the lights.
Just gave me a faint smile. ‚ÄúYou should rest.‚Äù
Rest? My heart was trying to beat its way out of my ribcage. I wanted to throw the blanket across the room and scream, but I didn‚Äôt have the strength. Instead, I waited until he disappeared into the kitchen and dragged myself over to the camera.
It was still on the porch, exactly where I‚Äôd left it.
Only it wasn‚Äôt recording.
Or maybe it had been‚Äîand someone stopped it.
I brought it inside and plugged it into my laptop. It powered on instantly, battery fully charged. I opened the file folder.

Empty.
No videos. No clips. Nothing from last night.
Except one file.
Ten seconds long.No sound.Time-stamped three hours before I even sat down on the porch.
I clicked it.
The footage showed the porch. Still. Silent. Unmoving.
And the blanket.Already there.
I stared at the screen, heart pounding. There was no other file. No sign I‚Äôd ever touched the camera. I looked over my shoulder toward the couch.
The blanket hadn‚Äôt moved.

‚Äî‚Äî

That night, I dreamed I was floating again.
Only this time, I knew it was a dream. I could feel the seams in the world‚Äîhear the hum of something electric and alive behind it. Like I was inside a simulation being rebooted.
I saw Matt. Standing in the kitchen. Back turned.
He was talking to someone. But there was no one else there.

‚ÄúNo, she hasn‚Äôt told me yet,‚Äù he said calmly. ‚ÄúBut she remembers more this time.‚Äù
He paused, then turned slightly‚Äîjust enough for me to see the side of his face.
It wasn‚Äôt his.
His jaw was too sharp. His eye socket was too deep. His smile was wider.
And then he looked straight at me. Right through the dream.
I woke up gasping.
Matt wasn‚Äôt in bed.

‚Äî‚Äî

VI. Fractures
I didn‚Äôt tell Matt about the dream.
I didn‚Äôt tell him that I‚Äôd seen him talking to no one. That his face had shifted in ways the human face shouldn‚Äôt. That he‚Äôd looked at me‚Äîinto me‚Äîfrom inside my own subconscious.
Instead, I started watching him.
At first, I thought I was being paranoid. Sleep-deprived. Traumatized by whatever had happened‚Äîor hadn‚Äôt happened‚Äîon the porch. But the longer I watched, the more I noticed.

Matt‚Äôs routines were too perfect. His footsteps too quiet. His movements too‚Ä¶ smoothed out. Like someone had practiced being him. Studied him. I would say something simple, like, ‚ÄúDid you water the plants?‚Äù and he‚Äôd smile just a little too slowly and say, ‚ÄúOf course. I always do,‚Äù even if I knew he hadn‚Äôt.

He never asked me how I was feeling.
He never mentioned the night I disappeared.
And he never questioned the blanket.

I started testing things.
Little things.
I moved a book he always kept on the coffee table‚Äîjust slightly, just enough to matter.
He moved it back.
I unplugged the toaster while he was out.
The next morning, he used it like nothing had changed.

I put my coffee mug in the freezer before bed.It was clean and back in the cabinet by morning.
The world was resetting itself.
I could feel it. Like my life had been copied and pasted‚Äîbut pasted wrong.
The edges were jagged. The continuity‚Ä¶ off.

‚Äî‚Äî

Three nights later, I stood on the porch again.
Same camera. Same railing. Same uneasy silence.
I didn‚Äôt set it to record this time. I just held it in my hands and waited.
The lights returned.
Four red points, evenly spaced. They blinked into existence like they‚Äôd been watching and waiting for me to come back.
I didn‚Äôt blink.
I didn‚Äôt speak.
I just watched them.
This time, they didn‚Äôt scatter.
They stayed in place‚Äîhovering. Humming. And then‚Ä¶ they tilted. Slightly. Almost as if‚Ä¶ nodding. Acknowledge me. Or recognizing me.
I stepped back.
And something inside the house laughed.
It wasn‚Äôt Matt.
It wasn‚Äôt me.
It was low and static and wrong‚Äîa sound that fizzed at the edges of hearing, like a corrupted file.
When I turned, the blanket was waiting on the porch swing.
Folded. Neat. Expectant.

‚Äî‚Äî

I couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore.
Something wasn‚Äôt right. Something wasn‚Äôt right about Matt. About the house. About the whole world around me. I could feel it now, like an itch deep under my skin, a wrongness I couldn‚Äôt scrub out, no matter how hard I tried.

The blanket on the porch swung back and forth in the faint breeze. It was waiting for me. It always was. It never left.
I approached it slowly, cautiously, like it was a trap. The fabric shimmered in the moonlight, its folds shifting, as if alive, though it remained perfectly still. I hesitated, then grabbed it.

The moment my fingers brushed the fabric, my vision warped. A sudden sharp pain shot through my temple, and for a split second, everything skipped‚Äîlike a broken record. The world flashed forward and backward, faster than I could process.
Then, a sharp tug pulled me toward the porch railing. I felt a familiar sensation‚Äîa pulling force‚Äîbut this time it wasn‚Äôt an invisible grip. This time, it was me being pulled across time and space, not just body, but my mind and memories, too.
I felt myself leaving. Not just the porch, not just the house‚Äîbut everything.

‚ÄúLeecy?‚Äù
Matt‚Äôs voice came from the doorway, strained. The wrongness in his tone pierced through the distortion.

I didn‚Äôt turn to face him. I couldn‚Äôt. But I could hear him clearly, and I could feel his eyes on me, even if his face was a blurred figure in the distance.
I tried to speak, but my words felt stuck in my throat.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have touched it,‚Äù Matt said, his voice flat, distant. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have gone looking for it.‚Äù
The it.
The blanket. The thing that seemed to weave itself into the fabric of my world. The one that never belonged.

The truth hit me in a flash‚Äîa terrible clarity, like being woken from a nightmare just as the darkest part begins. There had never been a Matt. There had never been a house. None of it was real.

Everything‚Äîthe lights, the blanket, the feelings of being outside my body‚Äîall of it was constructed. I was never meant to wake up. But somehow, I had. And now that I had, I couldn‚Äôt go back.

The room around me flickered like a malfunctioning hologram. It stretched and contracted, bending the laws of reality in ways that were impossible to ignore. My senses snapped and popped like electric wires going haywire.

I lunged toward the door, scrambling away from the porch. I could hear him‚Äîthe thing that was pretending to be Matt‚Äîwalking toward me, its footsteps unnatural, stiff. I pushed harder. But every step was a struggle. Every movement, slow.
When I reached the door, it wouldn‚Äôt open. It was locked. Of course it was.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I breathed, yanking at the handle. ‚ÄúLet me out. Please.‚Äù

The voice that responded wasn‚Äôt Matt‚Äôs. It was distorted, a low, mechanical tone that sounded like several voices layered on top of each other, speaking in perfect unison.

‚ÄúYou are not supposed to be here.‚Äù
I felt the world pull again, the fabric of reality tearing and twisting around me. The porch melted away. The blanket unraveled like it was dissolving into the air.

The thing behind me stepped closer. It felt too close, like it was inside me, just out of sight. I could feel its presence pressing against the edges of my mind, tugging at the corners of my consciousness.
I slammed myself against the door again. Desperation surged through me, a final, frantic burst of strength.

This time, it opened.
The air outside was thick with a strange hum, the lights overhead flashing in rapid patterns, almost like they were speaking. I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I ran, stumbling out of the house, toward the street, toward the one thing that might save me‚Äîreality itself.

But the world kept shifting. The streetlights flickered in and out. The ground beneath my feet wobbled like it was a mirage. The grass, the pavement, the trees‚Äîall blurred together, as if they didn‚Äôt belong.
I wasn‚Äôt running in the world anymore. I was running through it.

‚Äî‚Äî

I don‚Äôt know how long I ran.
The town became a blur of shifting shapes. The sky above stretched and collapsed, the stars flickering like malfunctioning pixels. I could still hear it‚Äîthe thing behind me. The one pretending to be Matt. The one that knew I was trying to escape.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave,‚Äù it called, distorted, overlapping itself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already gone.‚Äù
I fell. But I didn‚Äôt land on the ground. I landed in nothing.
And then‚Ä¶ there was silence.
I don‚Äôt know how much time passed. How much of this is real.
But I woke up again.
But this time, it wasn‚Äôt the porch.It wasn‚Äôt the house.It wasn‚Äôt even me.

The last thing I remember is the blanket.
The blanket that never left.

It was my first flight and that too to the city that is in a marquee in front of my eyes as soon as the ‚Äúmast magaan‚Äù plays through, Chennai.
		 With almost a dozens of lies in the pockets of my tongue, ready to be presented as soon as someone from the family calls, I planned the solo trip to Chennai and Pondicherry. After rehearsing my answers to the core, I stepped nervously to the Indigo counter.
		The excitement was at  zenith and I, successfully  overpacked my bag with extra  560gram(the kaji nemus did its job well). Me, being selectively social,l was immediately checked and I decided to hand over the 500 rupees note to escape the embarrassment of opening my bag in front of the audience to my situation.
		I headed towards the check- in bag screening counter and I saw the males opening their belts on a tray. I was well schooled of what to be placed on the tray but I thought to be smarter and started opening my belt only to be shouted by a security personnel ‚Äú its for the males only‚Äù(yeah now the spotlight was on me,again). Encouraged myself, ‚Äúyou are learning‚Äù; I ignored the ‚Äúlog kya kahenge‚Äù quite effectively.
		I reached the allotted gate number reviewing through the shops and prices of the eateries. I was taught well about the entrance, boarding including the dress code(girl thing) and what not except the information that  boarding time and flight time are different.
Being tempted well by the steaming coffee, I stopped by the coffee shop and was determined to have a strong morning like the coffee. The people were moving towards the gate number I was allotted and me, knowing my flight time, was sipping my steaming coffee to the point that I could hear my name being called aloud. Grasping the situation and being directed by the vendor, the very next moment I was rushing towards the gate.
Boarding the bus, I gazed at the lined up aircrafts. The same seems insignificant once it meets the sky. So are the dreams. I dreamt of boarding a flight and that day, on the bus, I was dreaming of new lands and the prior dream seemed so insignificant to me. 
		I was on my first flight, half breathed, at the seat number 25A. The you tube videos of finding the seat, fastening seatbelt, the breathing exercises in case its needed during takeoff; everything was performing a theatrical inside my head. 
		Peeping through the glass, I saw that evening of January, while biding bye to my uncle and aunt at the airport and my eyes were fixated at the flights getting disappeared into the clouds. Manifestations do work miraculously. 
		The flight moved from it‚Äôs  apron and gradually took the taxiway. My heart raced along the yellow lines. The morning smelled exclusive to me. The flight reached the runway and in no time I was into the clouds, the same clouds I manifested to barge into, that January evening.
		I was flying to a new land and may be to new experiences. I was excited to gather my own stories to tell as a grandmother. Suddenly that voice questioned, ‚Äúare you sure you are going to live that long?‚Äù. ‚Äúekdom risk nahin lene ka re baba‚Äù and I decided  to write ‚ÄúSTEPPING INTO TRAVEL‚Äù.",0,1745998222.0,travel,0,0.5,False

**TL;DR: My mom with 5 children didn't tell me how to become an adult, we're moving to a smaller apartment, no ID, no bank, no job, and I'm about to crash out**

Background Info/Living Situation:  
My mom, she's around 40 now and hasn't taught me anything ranging from starting a job application, creating a bank account, all the other adult stuff or things you should at least have before coming an adult. She's a single divorced mom with 5 children. My brother is 20, no job, watches my younger siblings (13 F, 8 M, 7 F) when she's at work. I've tried asking her multiple times if I could have a job but she uses my dad as an excuse, saying something like ""your dad will say that I'm not treating you well and giving you money,"" when I have asked my dad personally, he said it's okay for me to get a job. It's fustrating since I have to rely on continously asking her for money and she doesn't always have cash on her. I spend about $30 a week on my own food, sometimes less. I survive off coffee in the mornings and mcdonalds for lunch/dinner after college. I try to eat as much but everyone in my house is hungry so like, food is gone and there's barely anything to eat. Right now I weigh 83 lbs...

We were forced to sell our house and now we have been living in an 2 floor, 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment since this February. Rent is about $3000 per month and my mom doesn't like that so we are moving again next month to a smaller, cheaper apartment with 3 bedrooms (since we own it, my mom renovated and added one more room) and 1 bathroom. As much as I love my siblings, I value my own privacy and space.

The current apartment I am in now is conviently placed near a bus stop that goes to my college. This semester, I have class at 9AM and end around 3PM-4PM, depending on the day. It's easy to go and come back from here to there since commute takes an hour. But now that we're moving, the smaller apartment requires a bit of walking and I would have to take a bus, do a lot of transferring... commuting would take an hour and 30 mins, not including traffic in the mornings. Due to time conflicts, I really want to get as much classes done for my major (BA-Psychology) so next semester, my earliest class is at 8:30. I've asked my mom to dorm so that I don't have to wake up at 5am and commute before early morning traffic. She says okay but I'm not sure if she'll actually go through with it. I'm aware that dorming is expensive, on top of meal plans and tuition fees... this is why I want to work and at least help her pay for my college stuff.

I only know my SSN, I don't know where my birth certificate is (asked my mom, she said she'll find it later... it's been months), don't have any form of identification with a picture and birth date, and no bank account. I don't know what to do guys...

Every single thing about the experience was fantastic. The customer support is excellent... the delivery was super quick - I think it took 2 days to deliver to Noida. 

And the beans were of exceptional quality. Fruit forward yet balanced. And a nice gentle sweet lingering aftertaste. The beans had a clarity and consistency that I've not seen in most other Indian beans. It was impossible to mess it up - I tried different methods on the V60 - the Hoffman method, the 3 pour, a bloom followed by a slow single pour - it gave me a lovely cup on all methods. Only perhaps the Inverted AP attempt was a cup that I didn't feel the need to repeat. Generally, finer grinds and lower temperatures brought out its fruitiness more. 

Another thing that I appreciate about Curious Life is that they don't do a lot of different roasts. They found one fantastic bean and went with it - so I know what to buy, and know that it has been handpicked amongst a lot of options by the roaster. Curious for what they come up with next.   
  
Definitely buy it if you do black coffee with filter methods.

# üóì Week Before the Exam

**Visit your testing site**. Ask for directions where your assigned building is. Ask about drop-off spots, gate opening times, and testing day protocols.

**Adjust your sleep routine**. Start sleeping and waking up at the same time as your board exam schedule para alert ka when answering on the day. As a night owl, dito talaga ako nahirapan ahhaha and tbh antok talaga ako nung Day 1 üòÖ

**Final push!** Tinapos ko lahat ng final coaching materials, reviewed wall notes, and memorized high-yield info (common values, key concepts, etc.).  
Tip: Don‚Äôt rely too much on huling bulong - I wish I balanced it better and reviewed more concepts that actually came out :((

**Plan your D-day routine**. Book nearby accommodation if needed, plan your commute, prepare breakfast, and  wake up early. Avoid being late (di na pinapapasok yung late students kahit sa 2nd day)

**Prepare your things.** Bring your NOA, valid ID, test materials, jacket, water, meds, tissue, and snacks. Refer to latest PRC guidelines for your exam.  
‚Ä¢ Di naman need na clear backpack (since iniiwan sa front ng room) pero dapat clear yung lalagyan nyo ng food/ snacks (linalagay near sa seat). Linagay ko sa brown paper bag akin tapos pinalabas talaga ng proctor lahat ng snacks hahahuhu

üç¨ Snacks: I brought crackers, candies, coffee, and water (remove all bottle labels)  Stick to foods na usual mong kinakain. Di ako kumakain while answering the exam (sa breaks lang) para di madumihan yung scantron tapos kung umiinom ng tubig, di ko tinatapat sa paper hahaha 

üíä Meds: I brought Biogesic, Cetirizine, and Diatabs (effective kasi napajebs talaga ako sa kaba sa break üòÇ )

# üìù D-Day Tips

 **Listen to your proctor**. Make sure to listen and follow ur proctor step-by-step in filling out info or using the scantron. Wait for instructions kahit alam nyo na yung usual routine. Samin sabay2 kami nagshade at fill out ng mga info sa start.   
‚Ä¢ Shade your name and correct SET number properly  
‚Ä¢ Have your NOA signed after each NP and keep it for oath-taking.

‚úÖ **Exam strategy**  
‚Ä¢ **Shading:** What works for me is answer on the exam page then shade before moving to the next page. Some people do 5 items answer then shade, answer all items before shading, etc. Try to time yourself when answering practice exams while shading to find the technique that works.   
‚Ä¢ **Difficult items:** Kung di ko alam yung sagot, sinusulat ko yung initial answer/best guess sa testpaper. Binabalikan ko sya after ko sagutan yung ibang items, pinag-iisipan ulet bago ko i-shade. Huwag mag overthink, read keywords, eliminate wrong answers, and stay calm siz

‚Ä¢ **Erasures:** Personally, parang 30+ items yung na erase ko overall huhu (pumasa naman üòé pero wag tularan) - tip nila ay wag mo na ierase ang first answer mo unless sure na sure ka na yung new answer mo ang tamang sagot. Ok lang naman mag erase but make sure to erase cleanly.  
‚Ä¢ **Time/ Breaks:** Usually 1.5 hrs keri na masagot lahat tapos recheck na sa last 30 minutes. Huwag ma-pressure kung may mabilis matapos, focus on your paper, and recheck your answers. May 1 hr break in between NPs para kumain, mag CR, etc. Sa room namin, natulog lang kami di na kami masyado nagchikahan haha. Keep phones in your bag, not in your pocket, to avoid issues.

# üôè After Day 1

* Have a meeting place ready kung susunduin ka.
* Wag na magcompare ng sagot or magsocial media- masstress ka lang HUHU 
* Wag panghinaan ng loob kung nahirapan ka -may second day pa para bumawi!
* Personally, nagsimba ako at nagpabless sa pari hahahaha nagreview rin ako nang onti (lumabas naman ) Make sure to rest, para may energyy

Hello all. I have recently developed aversive allergy fearing ARFID after almost 2 years of illness with no answers and then having an allergic reaction to miralax. Miralax is pure polyethelene glycol (peg) which is in so many things, including food items. I also have random hives and things pop up and chronic itching which was recently investigated for MCAS, but that diagnosis is looking unlikely. I have now become paranoid that PEG is hidden in everything. Even whole unprocessed foods and fresh produce where it wouldn‚Äôt possibly be there, I cannot bring myself to eat. I have been surviving on a diet of safe foods- Dino nuggets, tortilla chips, French onion dip, coffee with oat creamer and a lot of water almost exclusively for 2 weeks. I am struggling. Last week I went into an unrelated dr appointment and discovered I had lost 5 lbs since my last appointment‚Ä¶ 5 days prior. By now it‚Äôs gotta be 8-10 lost. I am lucky I was starting out a little overweight. I have been pushing and got over 1k calories in today but most days it‚Äôs been 500-800. I am struggling. I bought ensure drinks but am terrified to drink them. I am starting to feel very weak and having muscle pain, spasms/twitches, and lots of nerve pain sensations. Yesterday I started having intermittent sharp left side abdominal pain

When is the time to go to the hospital? I start to feel positive and optimistic and confident about trying to break out of this and try a new food ‚Ä¶ until I get it in front of me. I feel like I am wasting away and my next therapy appointment isn‚Äôt for another 2 weeks. I tried to get into an ARFID telehealth program and they wouldn‚Äôt take me because I was already seeing a different therapist. There is only a psych inpatient program in my town and nothing specifically for EDs.

I am also scared to go to the hospital because a lot of IV medications have PEG in them and it‚Äôs already a very overlooked and misunderstood allergy, so much that I had to find someone at a research hospital to even get any advice about it. Doctors literally google it in front of me when I tell them about it. 

Someone please help, any thoughts or advice at all, I don‚Äôt know what to do ‚òπÔ∏è I feel like I am going to die if I can‚Äôt stop this super quickly ",1,1745996957.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False

Entry-Level Motion Design Jobs That Aren‚Äôt Just Internships (Yes, They Exist!)


You ever apply to an ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù motion design job‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and then it‚Äôs like: ‚ÄúMust have 5 years of experience, 18 awards, and have animated Beyonc√©‚Äôs last tour‚Äù?

What part of ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù don‚Äôt they understand?
That‚Äôs not a job description. That‚Äôs a Netflix documentary pitch.

But hey, good news: You don‚Äôt need to survive 6 unpaid internships and a coffee addiction to land a real job in motion design.
Let‚Äôs break down actual entry-level roles that aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúintern disguised as employee #47.‚Äù


---

1. Junior Motion Designer ‚Äì AKA ‚ÄúWe Actually Pay You This Time!‚Äù

This is the sweet spot.

You're not leading projects (yet), but you're definitely not running for someone‚Äôs lunch order either.
You‚Äôre making animations, helping with storyboards, and finally using keyframes for cash, not class credits.

And yes, the team might still ask you to animate things ‚Äúwith more pop,‚Äù but at least you're getting paid to decode vague creative feedback.


---

2. Production Assistant (Creative Team Edition ‚Äì Not ‚ÄúHold This Light‚Äù Edition)

Hear me out. Production Assistant sounds like you‚Äôre about to carry sandbags.
But in creative agencies or motion studios, it often means:

Supporting editors and animators

Prepping files

Learning the ropes without being thrown in the fire


You‚Äôre in the room, in the work, and most importantly‚Äîin the budget.


---

3. Motion Design Content Creator for Social Media ‚Äì AKA ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Vibe Guy‚Äù

Social media teams are starving for motion designers who can animate short-form content:

Instagram Reels

TikToks

YouTube Shorts


Translation: You get to animate funny, flashy stuff that actually goes viral.
Bonus: You‚Äôll learn real-world pacing and engagement faster than any formal training ever could.

Warning: You may develop strong opinions about font sizes on mobile.


---

4. Assistant Video Editor with Motion Chops

A lot of video teams need editors who can throw in some sweet lower thirds, motion transitions, or animate a title card like a boss.
You might be listed as ‚Äúeditor,‚Äù but your motion design skills will sneak into every frame‚Äîand usually get you promoted faster.

Just don‚Äôt overdo the particle effects. They‚Äôre not that impressed.


---

5. Animation Generalist at a Small Studio ‚Äì AKA ‚ÄúYou Wear All the Hats, Even the Weird Ones‚Äù

Small studios don‚Äôt have departments‚Äîthey have you.
You‚Äôll animate, storyboard, pick music, maybe even voice a background character.

It‚Äôs chaotic. It‚Äôs fast-paced. But it‚Äôs gold for growth.
Just make sure you ask for the job title that reflects all the stuff you‚Äôre doing. ‚ÄúCreative Wizard‚Äù is fun‚Ä¶ but ‚ÄúMotion Designer‚Äù pays better.


---

6. Freelance Gig Ninja (You‚Äôre Self-Employed, but Your Mom Still Thinks You‚Äôre Unemployed)

You‚Äôd be amazed how many businesses need animated explainers, reels, and ads‚Äîand are willing to pay, even if your resume doesn‚Äôt include Pixar.

Start with small clients. Build a solid reel.
Suddenly, you're booked‚Ä¶ and you didn‚Äôt even have to fetch anyone‚Äôs oat milk latte.


---

Final Mic Drop: Entry-Level ‚â† Entry-Exploited

Just because you're starting out doesn't mean you have to settle for unpaid, overworked, and under-titled.

You have skills. You have style. And most importantly‚Äîyou know how to ease keyframes.
That‚Äôs a superpower.

So go find that job that values your work and your time.
Because motion design should move people‚Äînot just move you into burnout.

1kbacji,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1kbacji/aita_for_returning_a_book_after_years_of_no/,AITA for returning a book after years of no contact?,"Hey Reddit,

I need some perspective because I‚Äôm feeling super confused and hurt by what‚Äôs happened recently. A few years ago, I (F32) was really close friends with a girl I‚Äôll call Glinda (F32). Over time, things started to get uncomfortable between us for several reasons. One of the big things was that she had these super high expectations about how often we should hang out or talk, and I just couldn‚Äôt meet them. I was dealing with long COVID at the time, and it made it physically hard to keep up with her demands. I tried explaining to her that I just didn‚Äôt have the energy, but she took it personally and started getting hurt and resentful. It made me feel guilty for being sick. On top of that, her girlfriend, Natasha (F40), whom I barely knew, started getting involved in our conversations, giving her opinions on our issues and even messaging me during arguments between me and Glinda, which honestly just felt weird and invasive.

Eventually, all this tension led to Glinda deciding to end the friendship about four years ago. From that moment, we had absolutely no contact. We weren‚Äôt even connected on social media. She blocked me, and I did the same. Fast forward to a few months ago, I found a book that I had borrowed from her years ago. It was something she had always told me was her favorite and had sentimental value, so I figured I‚Äôd reach out to return it. I didn‚Äôt want to keep something that was so important to her, and I thought it would be the right thing to do.

AfterI contacted her with the purpose to return the book, Glinda added me on Instagram immediately after, and she insisted on having a coffee that day, saying we could catch up. I agreed because I wanted to be cordial, give her book back, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt think there would be any ‚Äúbad blood‚Äù between us at that point. At the coffee, I was polite because I‚Äôm just that way, but the conversation quickly shifted to talking about our old friendship, and she brought up why it ended. I listened to her, and I told her that I felt bad that she had felt excluded during that time, but I explained that I wasn‚Äôt in a place to offer her all the attention she wanted back then and that it was probably going to be the same situation if it happened again. I kept emphasizing that my only intention was to return the book, and that I was happy she was doing well, but I was not looking to restart the friendship.

Despite what I said, she kept pushing the idea of what our relationship would be like moving forward, talking about things we could do next time we saw each other. I left that meeting with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, because while I was happy to have returned the book and glad she was doing well, I didn‚Äôt want to have a deeper relationship with her anymore, and it seemed like she wasn‚Äôt ready to accept that.

I spent a couple of days thinking about it, trying to balance my own feelings with not wanting to hurt hers. After reflecting, I sent her a message that was calm and affectionate, saying that while I still cared about her, I didn‚Äôt want to rekindle our friendship. I made it clear that I respected her, but I wanted to move on. I said something similar to this:  
*""I really care about you and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve had this talk, but I want to be honest and let you know that I‚Äôm not looking to restart the friendship. I hope you understand. Wishing you nothing but the best.""*

She responded kindly and agreed with what I had said, saying something along the lines of this:  
*""I completely understand, and I‚Äôm glad we could talk about this. It‚Äôs okay, I agree with your decision. I appreciate the honesty. Can we stay connected on Instagram, though? I‚Äôd like to keep in touch at least in a cordial way.""*  
I agreed to stay connected on Instagram, thinking that it was respectful and nothing more.

But then, two weeks later, I received a huge, aggressive message from her on Instagram. In the message, she accused me of being ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù, of ‚Äúdistorting reality‚Äù to always make myself seem right, and of being ‚Äúmanipulative‚Äù and fake. She said I was a ‚Äúbad gossip‚Äù, superficial, and that I didn‚Äôt love myself, which apparently made me toxic to others. She mocked me for sharing my struggles in the past, like how hard it was for me to finish my degree and my emotional health at the time. To top it off, she said she had lied about where she lived because she didn‚Äôt trust me and mentioned that people from our past (who I haven‚Äôt talked to in over a decade) had ‚Äúwarned her‚Äù about me. It was like she completely turned on me. After sending this message, she blocked me immediately so I couldn‚Äôt even respond.

But the weird part didn‚Äôt stop there. While I was still processing this, Natasha (her girlfriend) sent me a three-minute voice message from Glinda‚Äôs phone, attacking me as well. Natasha echoed many of the same accusations Glinda had made, questioning my integrity, calling me a bad person, and saying all these hurtful things. The thing is, Natasha and I have barely interacted, and she had no reason to be involved. This whole thing felt so invasive and completely out of line.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I never tried to reconnect with Glinda beyond returning her book. I didn‚Äôt message her or try to rekindle anything after our conversation. The only contact I had was me viewing her Instagram stories occasionally, like I do with everyone I follow. I‚Äôve never spoken badly about her to anyone, and I definitely didn‚Äôt do anything to provoke such an extreme reaction.

I‚Äôm just feeling really disturbed by all this. I tried to end things respectfully and honestly. I didn‚Äôt expect to get attacked like this, especially by someone who had agreed to leave things in a peaceful, cordial way. Now I‚Äôm questioning myself, like, AITA for just contacting her to return her belongings after years of no contact? Should I have blocked them earlier after our initial falling-out? Could I have handled it differently so she didn‚Äôt feel hurt?

Thanks for reading, and I really appreciate any honest feedback.",13,1745996658.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,22,1.0,False

My whole ceiling is opened and I'll be redoing the elctrical anyway, so that's not a concern. I just want to get it right.

Marked with red is what I'm thinking at the moment. 

With green I have marked all the other lights-
1. Adjustable spot light to illuminate wall art next to the window.
2. Coffee table pendant light of some sort (medium size)
3. Small Pendant light that will drop on the right of the mirror next to entry door.
4. Large pendant light above dining table

The whole wall on the right will be built-in cabinets from floor to ceiling. Will it be ok to remove the two lights there assuming that there will be enough light from the dining room pendant?

Behind the dining chair might be some kind of art so I figured I should place a gimbal type recessed light there to wash the wall.

The rest I placed to illuminate the pathway.

I've had low iron for at least a few years now (5/6 years) - I suppose I could've had low iron for longer,  though.

Nothing I do is helping, my ferritin is always coming back low. I can't tolerate iron supplements despite trying different forms of iron(I get incredibly nauseous for hours and have gastro issues from them), so I'm trying to eat as much iron-rich foods as possible, as well as eating fortified foods and avoiding tea/coffee at mealtimes. 

I recently had a blood test, here are my results:

Iron - 36 ≈≥g/dL 

Transferrin saturation - 8% 

Ferritin - 6 ≈≥g/dL

Hemoglobin - 10,1 g/dL

Hematocrit - 33,2 %

B12 is fine (362 ng/L), folic acid a bit low (2,75 ≈≥g/L)


It looks like my iron is kind of ok, just a bit on the lower side - if my ferritin is so low, but my iron is not that bad, is low ferritin still concerning?

Should I be pushing for iron infusions at this point? I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm not entirely sure whether my levels are 'concerning' enough for me to push for infusions.

1kba0zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendofMushroom/comments/1kba0zi/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest_customer/,MITOLYN Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"If you've spent any time researching mitochondrial health supplements, you've likely come across the buzz around **MITOLYN**. Whether you're digging into ""**mitolyn reviews reddit**"" or just want to know the actual **mitolyn reviews and complaints**, this post has you covered.

This isn't just a shallow glance ‚Äî we‚Äôll break down what's inside MITOLYN, what customers are reporting, potential side effects, and whether it‚Äôs worth your money.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a dietary supplement designed to support mitochondrial function ‚Äî essentially helping your body‚Äôs cells produce energy more efficiently. With increasing research pointing to mitochondrial health as a key factor in aging, fatigue, and even chronic illness, supplements like MITOLYN have gained a lot of attention.

Its formula includes:

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)** ‚Äì for cellular energy and heart health
* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** ‚Äì promotes mitochondrial biogenesis
* **L-Carnitine** ‚Äì supports fat metabolism and energy
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì antioxidant protection
* **B Vitamins** ‚Äì critical for energy metabolism

This mix aims to boost energy, sharpen mental focus, and support long-term cellular health. But does it live up to the hype?

# MITOLYN Reviews: What People Are Actually Saying

When you look at **mitolyn reviews** across the web ‚Äî especially forums like Reddit, health blogs, and online retailers ‚Äî the consensus is mixed but leans positive.

Here are the most common themes from verified users:

# ‚úÖ Positive MITOLYN Reviews:

1. **Increased Energy Levels** Many users report a **noticeable boost in stamina and focus** after just a couple of weeks. One Redditor said, ‚ÄúIt took about 10 days, but I stopped crashing mid-day. I feel more alert without needing a second coffee.‚Äù
2. **Better Mental Clarity** People with brain fog or fatigue-related conditions have praised MITOLYN for helping them stay more mentally sharp.
3. **Good for Chronic Fatigue** Several people dealing with **chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)** or **long COVID** have mentioned MITOLYN as part of their recovery regimen. While it‚Äôs not a cure, some claim it helps manage symptoms.
4. **Minimal Side Effects** Most users didn‚Äôt report major issues, especially when taking it with food. Compared to other mitochondrial support formulas, MITOLYN seems to be well-tolerated.

# MITOLYN Reviews and Complaints: What‚Äôs Not So Great?

Despite the positive feedback, there are also some **MITOLYN reviews and complaints** worth noting.

# ‚ùå Negative MITOLYN Reviews:

1. **Price Concerns** MITOLYN is not cheap. Some reviewers on Reddit pointed out that for the price, you could buy the ingredients separately and save money. However, others argue the convenience and quality control of a single capsule are worth the extra cost.
2. **Delayed Results** A few users felt no real change until 4‚Äì6 weeks in. Others said they didn‚Äôt feel much different at all, even after 30 days. This suggests the supplement may not work for everyone, or that mitochondrial support isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù solution.
3. **Mild Digestive Issues** A minority of users reported **mild nausea or stomach upset**, usually when taking it on an empty stomach. This seems consistent with supplements containing B vitamins and CoQ10.
4. **Lack of Third-Party Testing Info** Some critical reviews highlighted that the company should publish independent lab results for purity and potency ‚Äî a growing demand among supplement users.

# MITOLYN Reviews Reddit Edition: Community Insights

Reddit has become one of the go-to platforms for honest product feedback. Searching for **""mitolyn reviews reddit""**, you'll find threads in health-focused subreddits like r/Supplements, r/ChronicIllness, and r/Biohackers.

Here‚Äôs a summary of what Redditors are saying:

* **One user on r/Supplements**: ‚ÄúI added MITOLYN to my stack and noticed an uptick in motivation and alertness. It‚Äôs subtle, but real. Expensive, though.‚Äù
* **From r/ChronicFatigue**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried a lot of mitochondrial boosters, and MITOLYN was one of the better ones. Took about 3 weeks to kick in.‚Äù
* **On r/Nootropics**: ‚ÄúSolid formulation. Nothing groundbreaking but well-dosed. If you‚Äôre lazy like me and don‚Äôt want to buy 5 separate ingredients, it‚Äôs a win.‚Äù

Generally, the **mitolyn reviews reddit** crowd praises the formula and convenience but calls out the premium pricing.

# Who Should Consider MITOLYN?

MITOLYN might be worth trying if you:

* Experience **chronic low energy**
* Suffer from **mental fog or cognitive fatigue**
* Want to support **cellular health as you age**
* Are recovering from illness that drained your stamina

It‚Äôs especially relevant for those interested in **biohacking**, **anti-aging**, or managing **chronic illness-related fatigue**.

However, if you‚Äôre looking for an immediate, dramatic energy boost, you might be disappointed. MITOLYN works best as a long-term, foundational supplement ‚Äî not a quick caffeine-like fix.

# Is MITOLYN Worth It?

Based on a wide range of **mitolyn reviews**, including Reddit threads and user complaints, here‚Äôs the final takeaway:

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Scientifically backed ingredients|Higher price point|
|Noticeable energy improvements|May take weeks to see results|
|Reddit community mostly positive|Some reports of mild side effects|
|Convenient all-in-one formula|Lack of third-party lab transparency|

If you‚Äôre willing to invest in a premium product and give it 3‚Äì4 weeks to see effects, MITOLYN may be worth a try ‚Äî especially if you're already supplementing for mitochondrial or cognitive health.

# Final Verdict

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt a miracle pill, but it‚Äôs one of the better-formulated mitochondrial support supplements available today. Reviews suggest that while it may not work for absolutely everyone, the majority of users experience meaningful improvements in energy, clarity, and stamina over time.",1,1745995327.0,LegendofMushroom,0,1.0,False

A few days ago I picked her up because she wanted to talk and she balled her eyes out about how frustrating this has been. We are in a very populated city and since the overflow of immigrants, it seems most min wage jobs have been filled by them, leaving people who come out of high school to work and save up before uni with disappointment. I feel terrible for her, and I hate to say this, it genuinely makes me angry at ‚Äúthose‚Äù people. 
She wanted to save and get a car so she wouldn‚Äôt have to bus to uni, now she‚Äôll have to, she won‚Äôt have any saved up to put towards textbooks or tuition.
I‚Äôve never felt I‚Äôve been racist towards anyone, but now I don‚Äôt even mind to say that immigrants who came here to Canada in such an overflow really piss me off. Now we have a job crisis, housing crisis and who knows what else. 

My cousin is a great girl, she has worked so hard to try to find a job she has been looking every day for the past year, applying to every min wage job she can. She even applied to Walmart 4 different times who rejected her likely because she has no disability and is Caucasian. 

Does anyone have any advice I can give her? Last time I saw her she was so depressed, I really think all these rejections are getting to her and I know she would be the hardest worker when she gets a job. She told me she isn‚Äôt as good as everyone else her age because she‚Äôs seen them on social media having jobs for the whole time she‚Äôs been job hunting. I really feel bad for her, no one deserves to get rejected so many times when they‚Äôre even a little overqualified for a minimum wage job in my standards. ",2,1745995296.0,jobs,8,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The glass straw tumbler boasts several features that make it a standout choice in the crowded market of reusable drinkware.

**Borosilicate Glass Construction:**

Made from high-quality borosilicate glass, this tumbler is incredibly durable and resistant to thermal shock. This means it can safely handle both hot and cold beverages without cracking or shattering. Borosilicate glass is also known for its non-porous surface, preventing the absorption of flavors and odors, ensuring that your drinks taste exactly as they should. The tumbler's clarity allows you to see the contents, adding to the visual appeal.

**Leak-Proof Lid with Silicone Seal:**

The tumbler features a secure, leak-proof lid typically made from BPA-free plastic or stainless steel. A silicone seal around the edge of the lid ensures a tight closure, preventing spills and leaks even when the tumbler is tilted or jostled. The lid is designed with a perfectly sized hole for the included glass straw, ensuring a snug fit and preventing accidental dislodgement.

**Reusable Glass Straw:**

Each tumbler comes equipped with a reusable glass straw, offering a sustainable alternative to plastic straws. The straw is made from the same durable borosilicate glass as the tumbler, making it resistant to breakage. It's also easy to clean with a straw brush, ensuring optimal hygiene. The smooth surface of the glass straw provides a comfortable drinking experience.

**Protective Silicone Sleeve:**

A silicone sleeve wraps around the tumbler, providing a comfortable grip and protecting it from minor bumps and scratches. The sleeve also helps to insulate the beverage, keeping drinks colder or hotter for longer. The silicone material is non-slip, ensuring a secure hold even when your hands are wet. The sleeves come in a variety of colors and designs, allowing for personalization and aesthetic appeal.

**Wide Mouth Opening:**

The tumbler's wide mouth opening makes it easy to fill with ice, fruit, or other additions to your beverages. It also simplifies the cleaning process, allowing you to easily reach all areas of the tumbler with a sponge or brush. The wide opening is designed to accommodate larger ice cubes, ensuring your drinks stay refreshingly cold.

**Dishwasher Safe Components:**

Most glass straw tumblers are designed with dishwasher-safe components, making cleanup quick and convenient. The glass tumbler, straw, and lid can typically be placed in the dishwasher for thorough cleaning. However, it's always recommended to check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper care and maintenance.

Key features of the glass straw tumbler include:
  * Durable borosilicate glass construction
  * Leak-proof lid with silicone seal

 ## FAQs Section

**Is the glass straw tumbler durable enough for everyday use?**
  Yes, the tumblers are made from durable borosilicate glass, known for its resistance to thermal shock and breakage. While glass is more fragile than plastic or metal, borosilicate glass is significantly stronger than regular glass. With proper care and handling, these tumblers can withstand the rigors of daily use.

**Can I use the glass straw tumbler with hot beverages?**
  Absolutely! The borosilicate glass construction makes these tumblers safe for both hot and cold beverages. The glass can withstand high temperatures without cracking or shattering. However, it is recommended to avoid sudden temperature changes to prolong the lifespan of the tumbler.

**How do I clean the glass straw effectively?**
  Cleaning the glass straw is simple with a straw brush and warm, soapy water. Insert the brush into the straw and scrub gently to remove any residue. You can also place the straw in the dishwasher for thorough cleaning. Regular cleaning ensures optimal hygiene and prevents the buildup of bacteria.

**Are the lids on these tumblers truly leak-proof?**
  Most glass straw tumblers feature lids with silicone seals designed to prevent leaks and spills. However, it's important to ensure that the lid is properly secured before transporting the tumbler. While the lids are generally leak-resistant, it's advisable to avoid inverting or shaking the tumbler vigorously to prevent potential leakage.

I usually stay away from food and coffee and anything expect water.

1kb9yie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kb9yie/how_you_would_feel_in_this_situation/,How you would feel in this situation?,"LONG POST.

Generally speaking, imagine this situation: you are a man with a good income. You are young (25yo), good looking, hitting the gym often, working on a good job with enough free time when you need it and have enough living space for a family of 5, but live alone because you haven't met someone you are 100% sure you love. You have great supportive parrents, which influence your life just enough to give a good advice, but not making actuall decision for you, you live for yourself. Overall - everything is great.

One day you meet a good looking girl. She seems smart, funny, you have some things in common, you start dating. Flowers, dinners, presents, you've seen her family few times, but usually don't talk to them, nothing seems suspicious. After some time you start having sex. It's alright. Not the greatest you had, not the worst, just alright, you like your girlfriend so it just happens and you both are happy. She moves into your home, you plan wedding, but you still not 100% sure about it, but on the other hand not refusing the idea either.

Later, when you speak about the wedding for the 50th time she leaves for a few minutes because she feels strange. Comes back in tears with a test and says that I'm going to leave her because... She's pregnant. You ask yourself - how? You use protection every time and not the cheap one. But you have good feelings towards her and feel like you can manage everything. So you buy a ring, tell family about the kid, wedding, plan everything together. In the back of the head the question still remains... How?

First kid was born, he's is 100% yours, congrats, you are dad now. You work harder, eat worse, sleep less, forgot what gym is, don't have friends either. Sex quality is not even the question because she can't yet get a hold of her additional weight and you don't want to stress her about it yet, so you you just close your eyes and the do the thing, regardless of your needs.

You live like this for 3 years. Kid is an angel, you love spending time with him. You buy him stuff, educate him, spend much more time and start hitting the gym again. However, sleep quality is worse. You wake up 2-4 times and it's harder to go back to sleep. You don't drink, you don't take pills. You feel like you don't need medical attention just yet, maybe later...

When you found out that she's pregnant again. While she's using some hormon pills from her doc to keep her immune system in shape after first kid and on wich you can't get pregnant. Long forgotten question comes back to your mind - how?

You spend lot's of money on her. More than you used to spend on yourself. Kid's spendings are out of the question. You gave your wife LC Prado, you drive 2018 Tahoe 6.2 RST. You sell Prado and gave her Q7 2016. You don't sit in one place - your income also grows. Second kid is born and suddenly out of nowhere you get a news that your wife's mother passed away. How? Alcohol addiction. You start digging. It wasn't her true mother. Her biological mother passed away from medicine addiction. Then you get info that her father was abusive, used to drink a lot and hit her. You have conflicting feelings, because your wife came to you out of the bad family and you don't know if her DNA will be good for the kids.

Now you have two kids. You love them very much, don't imagine your life without them and they look 200% like you both. But the sexual drive to your wife is long gone. She looks too big even for the closed eyes and dark room sex. You drink. You drink a lot to get anything sexual realted like a feeling. Wife gets on your nerves - when will be another vacation? I want a ring for 3000$, I need this, I want that. You send her to Dubai with your sister, kids, your mom. They are conflicting there, you feel pitty for your wife, but payed 15000$ for their vacation and another 10000$ for the future vacation. They left for a week.

You visit same coffee shop every day and often there is a beautiful divorced woman here around your age. She has a child from her ex. She seems friendly and after looking at each other again for the past 2 years you take a cup of coffee each, but you pay for her coffee this time. You walk, talk, she's educated, works on job that produces some decorative stones, and your wife refuses to work, but you don't care really, you just keeping the conversation going. By the end of the week you loose 11 pounds because you sleep well, was at the gym every day, feel motivated and... Sexually atracted again? That woman won't get out of your head. After a week of conversations she says that she really likes you and... Wants you.

You visit a really good doctor. You talk about sleeping, anger issues, gym, everything. She gives you some pills you don't know and asks ""May I say something?"" You answered - yes, sure. She told you that you need a divorce and she's already expects it with 85% chance. You wife will only make things worse - arguing, yelling, not working, taking bad care of home. While you work, take your kids to every possible sport activity, to kindergarten, later bring them home, feeding them, washing them. You ask yourself one question... Are you going to live without the sex untill the end? And is this your end goal?

You start remembering how it all started. Could your wife poke a condom to leave her family by being pregnant? Did she took those pills at all before second kid? Are those pills were hormonal? You sit and mind goes crazy. You have everything - best job in the world, great home, lovely kids, no debt. The only thing that brakes the frame is... Your wife. Can you leave her? You don't know. Can you cheat? You don't know. You feel like you don't know nothing.

I‚Äôve spent the past few weeks researching this supplement, reading dozens of **Mitolyn reviews**, checking for **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, and digging into what people are saying in **Mitolyn reviews Reddit** threads. This post will give you a full breakdown of what I found so you can decide if Mitolyn is worth your money‚Äîor if you‚Äôre better off skipping it.

# üíä What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** ‚Äì For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** ‚Äì Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# üßµ Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **‚ÄúMitolyn reviews Reddit‚Äù**, the first thing you‚Äôll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here‚Äôs what I gathered:

**üëç Positive Reddit Reviews:**

Some users claim they‚Äôve seen real benefits from using Mitolyn. In particular, several people in r/Nootropics and r/Supplements mentioned:

* **Improved focus** ‚Äì Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** ‚Äì Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** ‚Äì A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I‚Äôm finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother‚Äînot jittery.‚Äù*

**üëé Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints:**

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **‚ÄúMitolyn reviews and complaints‚Äù**, I found feedback like:

* **No noticeable effect** ‚Äì A lot of people said they didn‚Äôt feel any different after using it for weeks.
* **Too expensive** ‚Äì Some Reddit users felt the price point didn‚Äôt match the results.
* **Mild side effects** ‚Äì A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*‚ÄúHonestly? Didn‚Äôt do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I‚Äôm not buying again.‚Äù*

# üî¨ Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

So, while Mitolyn‚Äôs ingredients are backed by science, whether it ‚Äúworks‚Äù comes down to how your body responds to the blend. That‚Äôs probably why **Mitolyn reviews** are so mixed.

# üõí Where Can You Buy Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is available on several platforms, including its official website and Amazon. Prices vary depending on the supply (monthly vs. 3-month supply), but it‚Äôs generally in the mid to high range for supplements.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pro tip:** If you‚Äôre buying from third-party sellers, double-check for authenticity. Some Reddit users warned about knock-offs or expired stock on lesser-known sites.

# üì¶ Shipping, Returns, and Customer Service

While looking into **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, a few themes came up around customer service:

* **Shipping is generally fast**, especially within the U.S.
* **Customer support is responsive** according to some, but others reported difficulty getting refunds.
* **Return policy**: Some Redditors mentioned that the return window is tight, and only unopened bottles qualify.

One user said:  
*‚ÄúI tried to return it after two weeks, but they said it had to be unopened. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with that.‚Äù*

So, if you‚Äôre on the fence, it might be smart to order just one bottle and see how you react before committing to a larger supply.

# ‚úÖ Final Verdict: Is Mitolyn Worth Trying?

If you‚Äôre dealing with low energy, brain fog, or just looking to optimize mitochondrial health, Mitolyn could be worth a try. The ingredients are solid, and there are plenty of **Mitolyn reviews** that suggest it helps‚Äîespecially for people in their 30s and older.",1,1745994913.0,RemnantFromTheAshes,0,1.0,False

# üì¶ Shipping, Returns, and Customer Service

While looking into **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, a few themes came up around customer service:

* **Shipping is generally fast**, especially within the U.S.
* **Customer support is responsive** according to some, but others reported difficulty getting refunds.
* **Return policy**: Some Redditors mentioned that the return window is tight, and only unopened bottles qualify.

One user said:  
*‚ÄúI tried to return it after two weeks, but they said it had to be unopened. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with that.‚Äù*

So, if you‚Äôre on the fence, it might be smart to order just one bottle and see how you react before committing to a larger supply.

If you‚Äôre dealing with low energy, brain fog, or just looking to optimize mitochondrial health, Mitolyn could be worth a try.

These covers are designed to fit snugly over the keyboard, providing a barrier against potential damage without hindering typing performance.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a MacBook keyboard cover hinges on several crucial design and material choices. These features determine not only the level of protection offered but also the typing experience and overall usability.**Material Quality:** the material used in a MacBook keyboard cover significantly impacts its durability and feel. High-quality silicone and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) are popular choices. Silicone offers excellent flexibility, shock absorption, and a soft, comfortable typing surface. TPU,on the other hand,provides superior openness,resistance to wear,and a more rigid structure. The choice of material depends on individual preferences and priorities, with silicone favored for its tactile feel and TPU for its clarity and robustness.**Precise fit:** A well-designed keyboard cover should conform precisely to the contours of the MacBook keyboard,ensuring that each key is fully covered without obstructing its movement. The cover needs to be molded to the exact dimensions of the specific MacBook model, taking into account any variations in key spacing and layout. A loose or ill-fitting cover can slide around during use, leading to inaccurate typing and a frustrating user experience. Precise fit is paramount for both protection and usability.

**Thickness and Transparency:** The thickness of the keyboard cover affects both its protective capabilities and its impact on typing comfort. A thicker cover provides greater protection against spills and debris but may also reduce tactile feedback and increase typing fatigue. Transparency is important for users who want to maintain the original appearance of their MacBook and easily view the keyboard lettering and backlighting.Balancing protection,comfort,and visibility is key to choosing the right thickness and transparency level.

**Easy Request and Removal:** The ease with which a keyboard cover can be applied and removed is an critically important consideration, especially for users who frequently clean their devices or switch between using the cover and typing directly on the keyboard.Covers that are too arduous to install or remove can cause frustration and perhaps damage the keyboard. A good keyboard cover should slip easily onto the keyboard and stay securely in place during use, yet be simple to remove for cleaning or replacement.**Washability and Cleanliness:** Given that keyboard covers are designed to protect against spills and dust, their washability and ability to maintain cleanliness is crucial. High-quality keyboard covers are typically waterproof and can be easily cleaned with soap and water or disinfectant wipes. Antimicrobial properties can also be a valuable feature, helping to prevent the growth of bacteria and germs on the keyboard surface. Regular cleaning is essential to maintain hygiene and prolong the lifespan of the cover.

**Keyboard Backlight Compatibility:** Many MacBook users rely on the keyboard backlight for typing in low-light conditions. A good keyboard cover should not significantly impede the transmission of light from the keyboard backlight, allowing users to easily see the keys in dimly lit environments. Obvious or translucent covers are ideal for maintaining backlight visibility,while opaque covers may block the light and make typing more difficult in the dark. The level of backlight compatibility is an critically important consideration for users who frequently work in low-light settings.

Key features of a Macbook keyboard cover include:

*   Precise Fit for Each macbook Model
*   Durable Material
*   Easy application and Removal
*   Washable and Reusable
*   Keyboard Backlight compatibility

## Core Benefits

MacBook keyboard covers offer a range of practical benefits that enhance the user experience and protect the device. These benefits extend beyond simple protection, contributing to improved hygiene, noise reduction, and overall comfort.

**Protection Against Spills and Dust:** The primary benefit of a MacBook keyboard cover is its ability to shield the keyboard from accidental spills and dust accumulation. Liquids can cause significant damage to the delicate electronics within a MacBook, leading to costly repairs or even complete device failure. A keyboard cover provides a waterproof barrier that prevents liquids from seeping into the keyboard and causing damage. Similarly, the cover prevents dust and debris from settling between the keys, maintaining the cleanliness and functionality of the keyboard.

**Reduced Noise While Typing:** Typing on a MacBook keyboard can sometimes generate a noticeable amount of noise, especially in quiet environments. A keyboard cover can definitely help to dampen the sound of the keys, reducing the noise level and creating a more pleasant typing experience. This is especially beneficial for users who work in shared offices, libraries, or other noise-sensitive environments. The noise reduction effect is more pronounced with thicker silicone covers, which provide greater cushioning for the keys.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** Keyboards are notorious for harboring bacteria and germs, due to the constant contact with hands. A keyboard cover provides a cleanable surface that can be easily wiped down with disinfectant wipes or soap and water, helping to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of germs. This is particularly important for users who share their MacBooks with others or who are concerned about maintaining a clean workspace. Antimicrobial keyboard covers offer an even greater level of protection against bacteria and germs.

**Protection Against Wear and Tear:** Over time, the keys on a MacBook keyboard can become worn and faded due to repeated use. A keyboard cover protects the keys from wear and tear, preserving their original appearance and extending the lifespan of the keyboard. This is particularly beneficial for users who type frequently or who want to maintain the resale value of their MacBooks. The cover acts as a barrier against scratches and abrasions, keeping the keys looking like new.

**Customization and Personalization:** MacBook keyboard covers are available in a wide range of colors, designs, and textures, allowing users to customize the appearance of their MacBooks and express their personal style. From solid colors to vibrant patterns, there is a keyboard cover to suit every taste. some covers also feature custom lettering or keyboard shortcuts, enhancing both the aesthetics and the functionality of the keyboard.

**Will the MacBook keyboard cover fit my specific MacBook model?**

The fit of a MacBook keyboard cover is dependent on your specific model and year.

Take Starbucks for example. They‚Äôre under some major fire for a variety of reasons and even after all of the programs and above minimum wage pay, they‚Äôre still getting slammed for not paying a living wage. 

Everyone targets the large salaries they see from executives. The Starbucks CEO for example earned $96 million in his first four months. And most of that is from stocks since his base is technically $60,000 and his bonus was $5 million while the stocks covered the rest. And I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs set up that way to avoid some taxation. 

So let‚Äôs assume he earned that $96 million in four months consistently all year. That would come out to $288 million in total for the year. Seems like a lot. 

However, Starbucks employs roughly 381,000 employees which includes the store and corporate staff. 

So now let‚Äôs divide that $288 million by 381,000‚Ä¶that comes out to a whopping $755 for each person. And that‚Äôs if the CEO receives zero compensation. That definitely won‚Äôt be much of an increase to the employees and won‚Äôt be a living wage at all. 

So now let‚Äôs do the rest of the executives. There‚Äôs 14 total executives and let‚Äôs now be very generous and assume they all get paid the same exact amount the head CEO makes. 

So $288 million for each would be $4,032,000,000. So now let‚Äôs assume they all get nothing and we‚Äôll divide that amongst the 381,000 employees. That would be roughly $10,582. A good chunk of change but arguably not enough to be considered a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù even as a bonus since most store employees make $30k-50k/year working full time and that would be if the executives make nothing. 

So then what about the big revenue people see? A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to understand that it costs a lot to run a global business like that. From store operating costs, to all of the messed up coffee orders that get thrown out and remade for free, to all of the training they put new employees through only to have them quit within a few days, to dealing lawsuits, supply chain, products, manufacturing, etc. all of that costs loads of money to do at their level. 

I guess I‚Äôm just curious as to why people say that they deserve a living wage when technically the company can‚Äôt even afford it in the first place which is why they have the ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù system where they have the jobs that will lose the least amount of money (the in store employees) get paid the least and it climbs from there. And that‚Äôs why college exists. So that you can skip that ground level work and jump up steps so that you get paid more because you showed the company you have the ability to complete tasks that involve higher risk transactions that could cause the company to lose billions if not done correctly (forecasting, handling the accounting books, etc.).  

And I‚Äôve always wondered why people act so entitled. Everyone acts like it‚Äôs super easy to run a business but trying to run a company that large is insane and the people at the top deserve a good amount of compensation. Until you try it, don‚Äôt knock it. Every CEO I‚Äôve shadowed does an insane amount of work despite what people might think and the amount of liability they have on them is crazy. Sure, if the company closes, they can sell their shares and get away from it all but that‚Äôs part of it. They likely wouldn‚Äôt become CEO of another company since they‚Äôd have a bad reputation while all the rest of the employees would go find other jobs relatively easy.

Their Columbian ""Clementine"" (the bag on the left) is SUPERB and I loved the super fruity ""Red Jam"" sample they gave me to try.

Just to be transparant: I have no affiliation with Kolibri and do not profit from sharing this in any way. I just love their coffees, think they are awesome people and am convinced Kolibri should be mentioned in all the usual lists containing names like Friedhats, DAK, etc.

I am not allowed to express any emotions in my house, and I don't have friends unfortunately. So, as a coping mechanism, I am trying reddit to make me feel better so that I can go back to grinding. I will keep this short.

I woke up this morning and when I sat to revise and write notes for a book that I was reading on business, I saw that my sister (16 F) had printed over a full page of notes. It took me at least 4 hours to write that page and it contained the knowledge and my thoughts of different topics on that. This is also frustrating because I am trying to change my sleep schedule from sleeping at 3 am to sleeping at 10 pm and I am finding it very frustrating. I slept at 10 for 2 days, then suddenly, I couldn't sleep even at 2 am the next day. So, sleeping at 10 pm is very important. But at night, she came into my room, opened my computer to make copies and started making so much noise like banging the extra chair that I woke up. Which thankfully didn't affect my sleep that much and I had a good 10pm-6am sleep. But this reminded me how during my jee exam, my father came into my room early in the morning, opened my computer and started making noise that I woke up 2 hours before I was supposed to. And because I was nervous for the exam, I didn't sleep on the time I was supposed to, and I only had 5 hours or sleep instead of intended 8 hours. I did some damage control by drinking coffee and stuff. I wasn't sleepy in exam, but I can't say about how much it affected my mental ability.

Back to today, she also took all the a4 sized sheets that I use to write my notes of books so I can't write anymore as all of them are finished. I don't know how she used like 30 pages in 1 single night. Now, if that wasn't enough, I was already pretty frustrated last night.

So, I have started working in MC D as a way for me to step into the real world and to understand the business things like inventory management, efficiency, employee management etc. So yesterday was my second day. I went from sitting 12-16 hours a day on my chair for studying and looking at my pc to standing nonstop for 4 hours. I was exhausted. They give 1 free meal to workers for lunch but because first 2 shifts are half shifts, I had no lunch, but I instead got the meal for home. So, I was very very tired after standing and working for 4 hours and very hungry. But I had to give half of everything to my sister because what's mine is ours and what's hers is hers. If that wasn't enough, my grandmother whose, not exaggerating, whole personality is how awesome 'old times' were and how today people are even breathing, walking and talking wrong (yes she said that), and the same person who reacts like a phobic to anything that is home made but is bad for her health like Maida or fried stuff called me from her room and scolded me to sit with her while I ate because I don't give enough time to her then didn't even speak to me at all but ate like half of my already half of a very small burger and ate some of my fries as well. Like I hear so much bs related to how much unhealthy food today's people are eating but then she comes and when I am about to eat something tasty after working non-stop for 4 hours, takes my food and then say that I should buy 2 burgers instead of 1 next time and then not even mention all this to anyone. But I can't say anything about this to anyone because remember? I am not allowed to express any kind of emotions in this house.

My life doesn't suck this much usually, and I am very optimistic about the future. But all this coincidentally happened at the same time which is making it harder for me to ignore all this and focus on things that matter. Writing all of this already makes me feel better. Please don't give me advise like leave your house, its toxic because yes, it is and yes, I am leaving it when I will go to college (3 months later). But I would be very grateful if you guys show some kindness and say a few words.

I am very grateful to all those who gave time to read this whole post. Thank you.

PS: I said I will keep this short. But this is not short lol. Also, if someone is interested, the book is The Personal MBA. If someone is interested in discussing examples and interpretations of the book because that's how it's supposed to be read, I am interested.
