I built my own AI coding tool - and I didn’t write a single line of code to set it up.

Here’s how I did it in under 10 minutes:

Step 1: Download VS Code. It’s free, made by Microsoft, and fun fact - Cursor is actually built on top of it. So you’re starting with the same bones.

Step 2: Inside VS Code, install the Cline AI extension. It’s basically your coding co-pilot. Feels just like Cursor’s agent mode - writes, completes, and suggests code while you sip coffee.

Step 3: Go to Google AI Studio, grab your free API key, and paste it into Cline. Boom. You’ve got your own AI coder.

It’s like building your own robot dev intern - but it doesn’t need snacks or sleep.

I tried this last week, and honestly? It works really well. Made a basic app prototype with just prompts. No config headaches. Just vibes.

Here is the full tutorial:

When at home I tend to drink milk based drinks only, but when in Portugal have a lot more espresso and will have several decaf shots later in the day. The times that I’ve tried to pull a decaf shots here they’ve come out super sour, I’m wondering if the style of bean at a standard Portuguese cafe is a much darker roast? I’ve noticed that different cafes will either have a decaf grinder or have packs of preground decaf they put into the portafilter, the output of both of those has been much tastier to me than what I’ve made at home with decaf medium roasts specialty coffees (maybe my natural taste preference goes more towards dark roast anyway and I don’t realize it since I don’t drink much espresso at home?).

My instinct to recreate at home was to try to get some Illy decaf beans but I’m not a coffee expert by any means, looking for some advice on how to recreate that style of shot at home. I think the common brand in Portugal is Delta but it’s not widely available here and my guess was an Italian brand would be the next best bet. ",1,1746274506.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1kdrjmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1kdrjmg/stop_squandering_me/,Stop squandering me,"     I didn't need to be up this morning because this is my hard earned day off. I would not mind taking you to work, in someone else's car or otherwise; I would not mind most any request at this hour- if you were actually nice and not aggressively attention- seeking and downright mean to me before i could even open my eyes. I know this is hard. Why do you insist on making it worse on us both?

     Do you know how long I've been unhappy? Do you know why I'm so often this way? Nobody wants to be squandered.  I have supported your personal development and this struggle we call life for over a decade.  It doesn't matter what i do or how long you keep that mask on, sooner or later you'll turn into a fucking jerk. 
Here's an idea: when someone supports you financially almost single handedly to help the the union get on their feet again, first by putting it all on the line for yours or their dream, then again for survival upon being confronted with how stuck they truly are, you don't rant at them while they're sleeping. You don't gripe them out at 2 a.m. for not successfully waking you for the dinner they helped make.  You didn't see that i cleaned the tub or made 2 trips to the store to ensure you had food for both night and morning, nice coffee first thing.  You don't ever get wake someone that way unless there's a legitimate emergency. You respect that your human needs sleep and does not ever want to wake up to being talked to like they're garbage. 

    I shouldn't even be up and alert right now. I should not have had to wake up to negativity being aimed directly at me, at full volume, only to be asked for a favour minutes later. Now you're quiet. Now you feel bad. And I'm sad and resentful. That's great for a healthy relationship, in'nit? 

     Stop squandering me. I know I'm pretty much all you have left. I never asked to be. I know you need someone to talk to. You, like everyone else on the planet, have to wait until the person you need contact with/ communication from needs to be prepared and willing to share their space with you. You don't get to disrupt someone's entire day from the very beginning- a most crucial part of how that day plays out-  then guilt that same person for enforcing that boundary. I bend over backwards for you on worn joints. I kiss your ass and this is my thanks. You fucking idiot.  I don't want to be a painful memory and another reminder of your failures. Why don't you start acting like you don't want that either.

1kdrjj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kdrjj3/might_the_melitta_64007_pour_over_coffee_maker_be/,Might the Melitta 64007 Pour Over Coffee Maker Be Worth Your Investment? Review Inside!,"I’ve been testing the Melitta 64007 1 Cup Black Pour-Over Coffee Brew Cone for a while now, and it feels like a compact revolution in how I approach my morning coffee breaks. Let’s dive into everything this little device delivers, and yes, what holds it back.

**Compact Design with Practicality at Its Core**  
This coffee maker caught my attention the moment I unpacked it. Weighing in at just 2.72 ounces, it practically disappears when stored, making it ideal for small kitchens, offices, or even travel. The durable plastic construction isn’t fancy, but it’s sturdy. The simple cone design doesn’t look overly complicated, and yet, its minimalism adds charm. Its dimensions of 6 x 5 x 4 inches make it feel like the espresso equivalent of those pocket-sized dictionaries you’d carry around in school. Bonus: No electronics to fail, which is always a win in my eyes.

**Experience the Brewing Process**  
Using a pour-over coffee maker is, let’s call it, a bit of an art form. With this model, I’ve learned to enjoy the ritual of pouring hot water in circular motions while the aroma slowly develops. The cone design feels intuitive; hot water extracts the flavors evenly through the coffee grounds. Not gonna lie, my coworker was impressed enough to mention it smelled like those boutique cafes we can’t afford during payday weeks. A small reminder, though: you’ll need #2 cone filters, so don’t forget to stock up.

**Perks**  
- Extremely lightweight and portable.  
- Simple and intuitive brewing process.  
- Perfect for a single cup without wasting coffee.  
- Dishwasher-safe, which is an underrated feature.  

[Check Melitta 64007 1 Cup Black Pour-Over Coffee Brew Cone price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00gs6j4es/)  

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
If you’re someone like me who values a fresh cup of coffee over brewing in bulk, this cone suits you perfectly. Each use gives you control over your coffee’s strength and flavor. The lighter blends let the fruity and acidic notes shine through, while darker roasts develop a bold richness. That said, if you expect it to magically turn low-quality beans into something spectacular, it won’t. This gadget respects the quality of ingredients you throw in.

**Favorable Features**  
- Adjustable strength based on water flow pacing and grind size.  
- Brews a full-flavored cup comparable to pricier systems.  
- Easy to rinse clean between uses.  

**Caveats**  
- It’s designed strictly for one cup; don’t expect batch brewing.  
- Plastic material might not appeal to eco-conscious individuals.  
- Heat retention depends on your mug's insulation, as the cone holds no heat itself.  
- Requires consistent practice for optimal flavor extraction.  

**Product Rivals**  
While testing the pour-over cone, I couldn’t help but benchmark it against other single-serve solutions like the Hario V60 and the Kalita Wave. The Hario feels a touch more premium due to its ceramic material and slightly larger opening for water flow. That said, the Melitta Brew Cone is far cheaper and much lighter, perfect for portability. Against the Kalita Wave, this one’s more beginner-friendly as you don’t have to think too deeply about technique. However, Kalita fans would argue the flat-bottom design provides more consistent extraction than the conical one.

**Money’s Worth**  
Cost-wise, this pour-over coffee cone is practically a steal for single-serve coffee aficionados. Simplicity and low maintenance are its two defining features. Some systems require hefty investments on accessories or replacement parts, but this elegant cone just needs hot water, coffee, and filters. Is it as glamorous as high-end pour-over equipment? No. But is it worth every penny for uncomplicated coffee brewing? Absolutely.

1kdrii2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdrii2,"*MID-TWENTIES, FEMALE ROOMMATE FOR LEASE RESIGNING IN 2-BED/1BA HELLS KITCHEN APT*","Hi everyone! I am currently looking for a roommate to take over the second bedroom in a 2-bed/1-bath apartment in Hell’s Kitchen. This apartment is really a gem and both my current roommate and I absolutely love it!

A little about me: I am a 25-year-old third-year law student (soon to be 26-year-old law graduate) and will working nearby. I’m easygoing, respectful, and big on creating a warm, supportive, and clean space. I will be working four days in the office and Fridays remotely! If you’re new to the city, I love meeting new people and doing new things together, so happy to help you feel settled in.

I'm hoping to find someone who is friendly, responsible, clean, and open to building a balance between a fun and chill vibe at home! I like being friends or friendly with my roommate, whether that’s a movie night together, going out to dinner, or just checking in at the end of the day and talking while we cook. I also love open communication, so guests, sharing things, etc. are totally okay with a heads up and I would do the same.

This apartment really is amazing and has a lot of charm. It’s in a great location, near the 50th C/E and 1 subway stops, and the 49th NWR stop, so very easy to get to other parts of the city. Central Park is about an 11-minute walk and the waterfront is only a few avenues over! There’s a lot of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops in this area as well as Trader Joe’s is only a 20-minute walk uptown. In terms of everything else:

\-The bedrooms are huge and are at opposite ends of each other, so there’s a lot of privacy. You would have two huge closets + gorgeous view of the city

\-There’s a true living room, kitchen, and bathroom space (everything is basically furnished – we would just need to get a couch + stuff for your bedroom)

\-Huge windows, so a lot of natural light.

\-In-unit washer/dryer, which is in my room. Your room would be a little bit bigger.

\-5th floor-walk up and on top floor, so there’s no problem with sound above us. -Packages are easy to get in, we have a buzzer.

\-Live-in superintendent who is very responsive.

\-Monthly exterminator (no problem with bugs) -Management is very easy to work with and this landlord looks at more than just income. They really value good tenants. It would be a standard rental application process!

This would be available mid-July (but flexible), and looking to finalize the renewal by mid-May! The rent will be $3,975 per month split + utilities, which is ConEd! Please reach out if you are interested!!",1,1746274296.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

I’m considering swapping out my grinder for either a grind-by-weight (GBW) or a single-dose (SD) model. I currently weigh my portafilter to ensure an accurate dose — usually aiming for an 18g in, 36g out ratio.

* **Mahlkönig E65S GBW**
* **Varia VS6**
* **Lagom from Option-O**

I’d really appreciate any insights from those who’ve used any of these grinders — what you liked, what you didn’t, and how it changed your daily routine.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Those snippets reminded me that before my ex I had a high sex drive and had my sexual desires hidden or forgotten because my ex was vanilla in general.

So I downloaded a dating app. A few swipes, nothing interesting, until I matched with someone whose profile I found entertaining to read. He’s 37M, has a degree, a job, his own house, and is also active in sports. We started talking, and the friendly banter turned into flirting, until we were open about our sexual desires. 

I’m not opposed to having sex, but I wanted to make sure that my lady parts are ok, so I had a pap smear and it turned out that I have vaginal thrush. I’m on a course of treatment that will last about a month. Maybe it was the universe telling me not to rush it.

Anyway, our chats were getting more and more intimate, and one day we decided to meet up. He’s not opposed to going for it if there’s attraction. I said that even though I haven’t been with someone in a long time, that I’m in no rush, and that I’d rather we get to know each other better. And he said he’s ok with that.

Fast forward to the first date. Maybe I’m rusty, as I’ve only been with the same man for 7 years. He paid for the order, and we had what I thought was a nice conversation. There were pauses, but I wasn’t sure if they were awkward. I tried to maintain eye contact even though I couldn’t help looking at his lips. I would notice his body language. Sometimes he’d lean back, yawn (he said he had an early shift that day), play with his hands, and also did eye contact. He’s much quieter in person than on chat.

The first date was about an hour, afterwhich I told him that I had a work meeting, and he said he was having dinner with his mom. We walked and chatted for a bit more, then we kissed each other’s cheeks, and went our separate ways.

A few hours after the date and he still hadn’t messaged, so I texted him, thanked him for the coffee, and wished him good night. He simply said, “You’re welcome. 😉😉”

Since then, no contact. He’d view my Instagram stories but nothing else. He hasn’t unmatched me on the app or blocked me on text.

I feel like a helpless teenager lol this is driving me crazy. I do like him and would like to see him again, but I don’t know if he felt the same way. I thought maybe he didn’t like my body (overweight) or my teeth. I don’t know if I should message first, because I didn’t want to be rejected if in the end he didn’t feel the same way. My friend said get over myself (in a nice way), that if there’s no more follow through then it’s okay.

What are your thoughts on this? It’s been three days of no contact, when we used to talk every day. I’ve since tried talking to other guys, potentially going on a date with another one, but none has been as fun to talk to as him. 

TDLR; went on a date, liked it and want another, but not sure if he felt the same. What to do?",6,1746273452.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

TLDR: Missing bright acidity is remedied by 78mm SSP MP.

There's a lot about the 078 I like but the unique cup profile, which is widely celebrated, isn't for everyone; there's minimal fines (the least I've personally seen), there is clarity but also something else happening I find hard to describe...

The turbo burrs have either a lack of bright acidity or what's there is overwhelmed by an intensity of other elements, which to my pallete is making some coffees taste something akin to slightly stale.
Don't get me wrong, I'd still take the turbo burrs over something like a Q2 heptagonal and with some coffees with something like a heavy grape vibe, I was really getting the clean ""juicy"" cup that many refer to but more often, for the numerous light roast, washed coffees I tried over several months, I was left disappointed and bemoaning the dead Wilfa Uniform with 58mm SSP Brew.
I'd try side by side against a ZP6, which was way closer to where I was before.

I really didn't like my options at this point, the burrs were seasoned and aligned as much as you can tell on ghost teeth, my better half took some convincing on the 078 purchase already, buying yet another grinder wasn't going to slide; I shock my fist at Lance Hendrick but figured if I'm not digging the turbo burrs he loves so, I may also feel differently to him about only other high claity burrs in 78mm size.

Nervously ordered the silver knight versions of the SSP, if I'd known the total cost of the grinder, the burrs, the import related charges and the seasoning beans, the time to fit, ensure alignment and season, I'd probably have done something else but I went through it all and the results have been pleasing.

I shouldn't have been so surprised by the improvement from both the turbos and the ZP6 cups, perhaps it was more relief than anything; my morning cups are fab again, testing side by side vs the ZP6 further confirmed what I was hoping for.

The alignment was performed by just changing screw torque, dry wipe tests were bang on perfect after a small adjustment, no shims required.
Before seasoning, I was leaning towards the ZP6, after running through 8KG of really average ""medium roast"" beans (which were oily and beyond most specialty roaster's espresso roast) the positions traded.
I've not bothered about calibrating to chirp, for what it's worth, in the same calibration position, at 800rpm and 55g batch, my ideal setting went from ~10 on the turbos to ~12.5 on SSP.

I fully accept that I could be an outlier, a weirdo, that you might have a very different experience, everyone is different; there is no such thing as better at this end of the market, just what you prefer...

...but there's not a lot written about the SSP 78mm, you could look at the geometry and think they're going to be like the 80mm high uniformity or maybe like the Weber ULF; I'm afraid I've tried neither of those and have only directly tested against an intermediary hand grinder and prefer them to the turbos. I simply give you my highly subjective experience, as yet another piece of noise in the difficult game of find the right burrs and grinder for you.

I’m starting a modular part-time masters at Cambridge University, so I really will only meet classmates and things for a week every couple of months, but with the fees being as high as they are I thought it makes sense to make the most of the experience and pack up and head to Cambridge for 2 years. I adore my life in Dublin so I’m a little concerned that I’m going to end up miserable there hah. 

What’s the social scene like? I’m not one for big nights out or anything. But would love to find a hiking group, or just people to grab coffee with etc. 

Are there lots of events and things in town?

What about good gyms?

And if anyone has experience of the dating scene, I’d love to hear what that’s like!

I cannot find it anywhere no matter how hard I try. I vaguely remember the name, but it was ongoing when I read it and I finished it once the author updated the last chapter (sorry if that doesn’t make sense 🥲). The plot was Will and his mom going to Italy. His mom was a singer and he was about 16(?), there he met Nico in a coffee shop and I think they exchanged numbers. The story progressed and Nico would take Will to his family’s pizza shop which his mother owned and him and Bianca helped out in. They also FaceTimed each other every night. When Will had to go back to America, they made it long distance and it worked great until Will broke/lost(?) his phone. Nico thought Will was ignoring him. Then a while later Nico went to uni in the US and (of course) saw Will. He was still under the misinterpretation that Will ghosted him, so he was mad and ignored him in person. They later talked it out and got back together. A really cute moment I remember happening (I forgot when in the book): Will took Nico to one of his
mom’s concerts and they kissed. It was really sweet. And I think the fanfic ended when Nico wrote his first book (he was an English writing major I believe) and in the front gave a special mention to Will. It was really cute and wholesome and I just loved this fic. I think the title was along the lines of ‘my treasure’ but I can’t remember.

We're ***developing a portable robotic arm that plays chess*** (also Go and Checkers) and we'd love your feedback before our next move.

Key:

* Portability: it fits into your backpack.
* It's designed to work with standard board and pieces you have, and automatically adapts to varying sizes and material
* Use it to mirror online match. Play globally against friend/ opponent using [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) or our built-in app. Or opponent who also use our product. Or you can choose to play against Chess engine powered by Stockfish.
* It can guide, suggest, tutor you for both begginner and advanced player. This is also possible by integrated AI-voice and conversational AI. So you can also use voice command like ""Quess to E4"". And you know what, you can modify the AI-agent config too (. voice, personality).

Limitation:

* Will not support for Blitz play or bullet due to speed constraint (or any time when you and opponent move very fast during final time, this will be a problem). We still do not have solution for that. 

The target **price will be around 299 to 399 USD** (or more)

We have completed about 30 percent of MVP prototype, and we'd love to here you thought on this, and if there would be any demand for it. Will you  buy it? If not why? Is the cost is too high? At what price you will likely consider it? Will you bring your portable chess robot at a coffee shop to show cse everyone? is this interesting ?

I've had a crush on my coworker for almost a year now, and what has made this confusing is i was also in a failing on and off again relationship pretty much the whole way through last year. It's made it difficult to understand my feelings for my coworker without feeling guilty or selfish, so even though now I'm sure how I feel about her I've convinced myself for so long that I didn't

We've gotten to spend a lot more time around each other in the past 6 months when my friend started working close to her and gave me an excuse to also visit her. Looking back now she gave tons of hints she was interested in me for more. Through a mix of self doubt and trying to preserve my failing relationship, I convinced myself it was all nothing and it was just me being delulu 

Eventually I finally permanently end things with my gf, and start trying to show more interest in my coworker. Though it seems like she is less interested now even though we maintain a good friendship, I just chocked that up to her being overwhelmed by stuff she's dealing with outside of work that she's told me. Despite this I still got her a present for valentines, and the following week asked her out to coffee/ drink whenever she feels like she wants to have a good time and get out of the house. She recieved both of them positively, but didn't really open up about her own feelings. 

Now skip to this week, and she ends up leaving work early in a really bad mood. She texted me she left and then told me about how her ex has been trying to patch things up with her, but she figured out he's been fucking other people and lied about it. I have no idea when this started but I imagine it coincided with her withdrawal of signs towards me.  I sympathized with her and let her vent about it, and I do genuinely feel bad for her especially since it sounds so familiar to the relationship I finally called the curtains on. But then I tried to lightly joke that she can just tell me no next time I ask her for coffee

But this confused her, she asked why and I explained that I had intended it as a date but don't really want to stand in the way of what she feels like she wants and that there's no hard feelings about it. She said she was super embarrassed and never considered that i was asking her on a date. I explained how I wasn't very direct and was in a failing relationship that lead me to convince myself she was not interested. She told me that she was interested in me in the time I thought she was, but she came to the false conclusion that I was gay (lol) and she's just been operating off of that mentality. However she didn't really explain how she feels now (probably confused af) 

I told her she can talk to me any time, and that we could still go for coffee later. But i think I entirely missed my chance which sucks, and think I won't really know unless things ramp up or fade away. I'm trying to give her space and let her figure stuff out, but it kills me that I felt like I could've been so more direct then, but now i have to be play it cool. 

I'm not really waiting or expecting anything to happen, but feel like i need advice on if I could've done anything right in this situation lol ",1,1746272699.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Nomad also has the same decaf and I've had one coffee from them before, that I enjoyed. So now I've been wondering whether I should order from Nomad or D stands for decaf. The latter also has some other decafs, that look interesting and much cheaper shipping for me.

She started being “friends” with this guy who used to be friends with her ex. She texts him a lot, especially when we are together. She talks about her ex with him sometimes. 

They became friends when we were split up, and apparently she vented to him a lot about how much she missed me (her words). She said she had to really get the point across that they were just friends when they first started talking

I recently was told that he asked her to meet up with him and another girl he had a crush on so my girlfriend could see if she thought this girl liked him. It’s was a very weird situation, my friends were telling me to basically tell her I’m not cool with it but I didn’t want to come across as overbearing or insecure. But I am uncomfortable with how much they text. I didn’t say anything except I told her my friends thought it was suspicious and she reassured me that he’s just a friend 

They ended up hanging out and she basically went offline for like 3 hours, just in a coffee shop. Afterwards she called me (she doesn’t often call first) and said it was really awkward. Since then they’ve seem to be texting less.

I’m usually a trustworthy person but we both agreed that getting back together is gonna raise some trust issues we need to work on, and my friend’s comments are making me a bit paranoid something happened. Am I overreacting?

1kdqx5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kdqx5i/loneliness/,loneliness (?),"Hi, I don't know if I'm looking for support or what, it's hard to even express how I feel. Over the past few months, I've been stuck in this mood, feeling constantly worried, in a bad mood, and mostly alone. I have a few friends (3) I hang out with about once a week, but I only hear from them then. The rest of the week, entire days go by without me receiving a single notification, from anyone. I work, go home, sleep, and the fact that this loneliness makes me feel guilty because technically I don't lack anything, so I don't know what I'm complaining about. Maybe I don't even know what I want. When I go out and then come home, I feel so bad about being alone again that I think I would almost rather not go out at all.

I've tried looking for romantic relationships, but it doesn't work. I don't know if it's because of my appearance or personality, but I don't think I can be likable to someone. With one person, I really put in effort because I liked them a lot, but they started talking to someone else as soon as they had the chance and stopped talking to me. I've never been in a relationship, and I'd like to have someone to share moments and small things with, but I've given up on the idea because every time it's the same story: as soon as they get the chance, they start talking to others and seem annoyed when talking to me.

All of this leads me to spend money on things I don't need to fill the void I feel. I feel like something or someone is missing that never was. I don't necessarily want a romantic relationship; even a friendship where we could do simple things like go for a walk or grab a coffee would be nice. The friends I have aren't bad, but I feel like if I disappeared, no one would notice.

It's all very confusing, and I can't express everything in words. There's more that I can't verbalize, and that's the worst part. Thanks for reading.",2,1746272208.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I started watching Gerstmann early in the Gamespot days, so was on board for all this nonsense for a very long time. Fully bought in.

Then along came Giant Bomb and my fate was sealed. 

I devoured absolutely everything, obsessively. Quick looks for games I didn't give a shit about - just because it felt like continuity with the crew. I just loved listening to them. I mean, watching a video about a game I don't care about is fucking *unthinkable* now! I'd never do this now. And that's a shame because a lot of times, I'd discover a new game I would never have even considered before. 

That was the magic of GB. It was a perfect coupling of listening to a crew of folks sincerely getting excited about videogames, while also getting smaller, or less well known games out there and helping developers and publishers spread the word. It was perfect, and I cannot believe how badly fumbled this has been by big invested interests in recent years. 

The bomb cast was NEVER missed. I listened to every episode, without fail. I used to fucking sync my iPod in the morning to make sure I had bombcast to listen to through my day. I was late to work sometimes for this reason. Bombcast was paramount. 

I watched everything. Every feature. Every premium video. 

I'm in the UK and because of time differences, unprofessional Fridays was usually my Saturday morning hang. I'd wake up, make a coffee, get breakfast, and sit and watch the bomb crew.  Magical times. 

GBeast ...   I mean, I can't say enough about that. Reading Austin's post in bluesky is when I realised I'm not okay about this whole situation.  ""It's like touching a hot stove in my heart.""  _Fuck_ man.  Yes.  

I loved everyone. I know people had their favourites, and gun to my head i could probably choose a favourite but I don't want to.  All of them were brilliant. Every member of the crew.  

I can't talk in too much detail about what I loved specifically, because this post would be way way WAY too long.  But giant bomb had a special, important place in my heart, for a long long time. Every day. Every day I had these people in my life. For a long time. 

COVID...  unfortunately. Eroded this for me. I got a lot of out their streams at first. But over time, during that lockdown, I saw far too many people in small boxes on screens talking over eachother in my personal life...  I basically just couldn't do it anymore. Tragically, I had to fall off Giantbomb. It still really pains me that this is basically what podcasts and videos have become at this point...  people in their own houses talking over zoom... because I still don't really like it much. But that isn't anyone's fault and this is not a criticism. 

Point is. I fell off Giantbomb, basically against my will, about 5 years ago. So, I'm not up on the most recent stuff at all.  

I kept my premium sub for years, and I went back occasionally. I went back for when members of the crew left....  which was always extremely emotional.  

But enough time and distance has passed now, that upon hearing the latest hubbub about what's happened to GB, I thought that while I obviously disapproved strongly I wouldn't really be as emotionally affected by it. Because I basically haven't been deep in it for years.

But seeing posts on this sub, has been bringing it all back for me. The memories and the nostalgia are still so strongly linked to deep, emotional attachment.  I can't believe Giantbomb is finally going away in a real, tangible way. And it hurts. 

""If I approach the idea too closely, it is like touching a hot stove in my heart."" 

Thanks everyone. ❤️

1kdqwc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kdqwc0/why_is_the_powerlix_a03_handheld_milk_frother/,Why is the PowerLix A03 handheld milk frother worth your attention? Review here!,"The PowerLix A03 is a delightful addition to my morning routine. As a coffee enthusiast, starting the day with a rich, frothy latte is a must. Using this handheld milk frother has made creating café-style beverages at home quick and satisfying. It’s portable, sleek, and performs impressively, but there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Stylish and Ergonomic Design**  
This frother is a lightweight tool with a black stainless-steel finish that complements any kitchen. What caught my attention first was the soft-touch handle, designed perfectly for a comfortable grip. I use it every morning, and its ergonomic feel ensures no fatigue even after prolonged use. The compact stand it comes with is such a bonus since it helps keep my countertop organized.

**Performance That'll Impress**  
The frother’s motor delivers a whopping 19,000 RPM. That means, in less than 20 seconds, it churns ordinary milk into luscious foam. Even experimenting with cold milk for a frappe worked like a charm. While primarily made for coffee, I’ve tried frothing almond milk, making chocolate milk for my nephews, and even whipping up powdered shakes. Each time, the results were consistent and satisfying.

**Check [POWERLIX A03] price on Amazon.**  

**Battery-Powered Convenience**  
One of the best features is its battery operation. Not being restricted by cords makes it a great travel companion. However, inserting those AA batteries can sometimes be tricky. A little fiddling was needed to align them correctly. Once operational, it’s smooth sailing, but I did notice the frother slowing down slightly as the batteries drained. Still, it offers consistent power for weeks before I need replacements.

**Easy Cleanup and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this frother is incredibly easy. After use, I rinse the whisk under warm water and leave it on its stand to dry. Unlike frothers that double as warming tools, dealing with sticky residues has never been an issue. The stainless-steel whisk resists rust, even after months of daily use. My only gripe here is that it isn’t dishwasher safe, but handwashing it is so quick that it’s hardly an inconvenience.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its robust performance and ease of use, it’s a steal compared to other options. The lifetime warranty is a standout feature, and knowing the manufacturer has my back adds to the value. Other frothers with similar specifications often require cords or include excessive, unnecessary features. I appreciate that this one focuses purely on frothing while maintaining an affordable price point.

**Pros**  
- Lightweight and portable design.  
- High-speed motor for quick, creamy froth.  
- Easy storage with the included stand.  

**Cons**  
- Batteries can be challenging to install.  
- Not dishwasher safe.  

**Product Contenders**  
In the world of handheld milk frothers, there is certainly some fierce competition. Compared to the Zulay handheld frother, the PowerLix A03 outshines with its higher RPM and sturdier construction. However, the Zulay frother includes a slightly beefier stand that doubles as a counterweight for extra stability. Meanwhile, the Aerolatte frother boasts an additional travel pouch for convenience, yet its motor doesn't match up in terms of power or speed. Each product has its charm, but for maximizing versatility, the PowerLix's winning combination of power and durability makes it a top contender.

This happened a few years ago. I’ve been making filter coffee with a Krups drip coffee maker. Like most coffee makers made in the last 30 years it has the feature where coffee stops dripping of there is no carafe under the filter basket.

My only excuse for this stupidity is that I hadn’t had my coffee yet. I turned on the coffee maker without putting the carafe in place. Fortunately I was making a small amount of coffee so it didn’t overflow. But the water sat in the filter basket, immersing the coffee for maybe a minute or 2 before I went back and noticed what I had done. I quickly placed the carafe and let the coffee flow out. I thought it was going to be ruined, but it turned out to be the best coffee I ever had from that machine.

Years later, I’m learning about different ways to brew coffee. I have a French press and a Hario Switch. After learning to use the Switch, I remembered this old incident and realized I had unwittingly turned my coffee maker into a Switch!

Riley.

I took the last sip of my wine, enjoying the warmth as it slipped down my throat, the taste lingering in a pleasant, slightly bitter finish.

I was supposed to feel at ease now that dinner was over, but instead, something about the way Grayson was looking at me felt wrong, and I couldn't help but be bothered.

The corners of his mouth were tight, and his eyes didn't stop darting around the room as if searching for something—or maybe someone—more interesting than me.

I couldn't quite tell, and when I set my glass down, he leaned forward, elbows resting on the table, hands clasped in front of him in a way that felt almost... formal. So formal that I half-expected him to pull out a legal contract from under the table.

""Let's break up.""

I blinked, almost sure I hadn't heard him right. ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" I asked, managing to let out a shaky laugh.

This had to be one of his pranks. Grayson was the type to tease, to play with words, and to try to make me guess what was real and what was just for fun.

But he didn't smile; heck, he didn't even flinch. He just sat there, looking at me like I was a stranger on the subway, and he was about to tell me to get off at the next stop.

""I'm serious, Riley. I think it's time we break up.""

I froze momentarily, trying to make sense of the words that had come out of his mouth.

""Grayson, you can't be serious,"" I said. ""We just celebrated three years together. You brought me here, to your family's restaurant, on our anniversary. Why would you do that if you were planning to break up with me?""

I forced another laugh, an ugly sound that even I didn't believe. I was hoping he'd laugh with me, or at the very least, let a smirk slip through.

I wanted to see that mischievous glint in his eyes, the one that said, ""Gotcha!"" But his face remained as still as a statue, and his mouth a straight line that was neither warm nor inviting.

He let out a heavy sigh, rubbing his forehead as though he was trying to ease his frustration. ""Riley, come on. You have to know this isn't working anymore. We're just going through the motions at this point, so it's better if we end it now, before things get worse.""

""Before things get worse?"" I repeated, feeling both angry and confused. ""What are you even talking about, Gray? We're fine! We have our moments, but every couple does. You don't just throw away three years because of a few rough patches.""

""It's more than that,"" he said, looking down at his hands. ""I feel like we're stuck. We're not moving forward, and honestly, I don't think I see a future for us anymore.""

The words came out rehearsed like he'd been practicing this speech for days, weeks, maybe even months.

I wondered when he'd made the decision. Had he known this was coming last month when he'd surprised me with flowers, or had he just decided, right here, right now, that three years of us weren't worth holding onto?

I let out a bitter laugh before responding. ""Just be honest with me, Gray. What's the real reason you're ending things so abruptly? You owe me that much.""

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. ""Riley, it doesn't matter. I just want us to end things simply and go our separate ways with no drama and no drawn-out explanations. Can't we just do that?""

I laughed again, feeling my anger rising. ""Stop being such a coward, Grayson. You think I'm going to accept that? After three years, you owe me more than some vague excuse. I want to know the real reason. How long have you been planning this? And don't tell me it doesn't matter—because it does.""

His eyes flickered around the room as if checking to see if anyone was watching us, and a look of irritation crossed his face.

He leaned in before whispering harshly. ""Keep your voice down, Riley. This is my parents' restaurant, and I'd rather you not embarrass me.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Oh, don't worry, Gray. I wouldn't want to embarrass you in front of your precious family. Hope this won't happen - anyone finds out that Grayson can't even be honest with his girlfriend.""

I leaned back, folding my arms, daring him to say more.

He groaned, rolling his eyes as if I were some nuisance he had to deal with. It was the same look he gave the waitstaff when they brought him the wrong order or when he was forced to wait in line at the airport.

That look of impatience mixed with entitlement, and it made my stomach twist with disgust.

""Fine,"" he said, leaning forward and hissing through clenched teeth, ""since you're so desperate to know the truth, here it is: I have to get married, and my family would never accept someone like you, who was adopted and doesn't even know where she comes from, as part of our family. Happy now?""

His response felt like a slap on the face, and I stared at him, my mind spinning as I tried to process what he'd just said.

Adopted? Someone like me?

My status, my background—it was something he'd known since the very beginning, and now, after three years, it was suddenly an issue?

""Someone like me,"" I repeated. ""Why is it suddenly a problem that I'm adopted, Gray? You've known that from the very beginning.""

My hands trembled, and I balled them into fists, pressing them into my lap to stop myself from doing something I'd regret.

He just sat there, his expression closed off and cold, like he was already a thousand miles away.

""I've met your family as well, and they've known I was adopted this whole time too. They knew I was the adopted daughter of the Morgan family, and your mother even said she was excited about the idea of us being together. She told me she couldn't believe she'd be in-laws with the Morgans.""

I remembered it clearly—how his mother had smiled and held my hands, like I was some long-lost treasure she'd stumbled on. She'd even joked about what a small world it was and how lucky Gray was to have found someone like me, and that night, I'd felt something close to belonging, as if I might actually have a place in his world.

Gray let out a dismissive scoff. ""Just because they knew doesn't mean they wanted you as part of our family, Riley,"" he said, shaking his head. ""Look, they didn't think this would be serious, and they never saw it going anywhere.""

He paused, his gaze drifting away as if he couldn't even bear to look at me. ""Now that it's time for me to get married, they want me with someone more... suitable. Someone with the right background, not someone who could very likely be the daughter of a nobody.""

""A nobody?"" I whispered. ""That's what you think I am? Just because I don't know where I come from? You've known for three years, Gray. You've known, and it was never an issue, but now, suddenly, it's a problem?""

He sighed, as if I were inconveniencing him by even asking. ""Look, I was hoping we could end this on a friendly note, Riley. I didn't want it to be like this.""

He shrugged, his eyes meeting mine for a fleeting second before darting away. ""But I guess that's not possible now. I just hope you can understand and accept the situation sooner rather than later.""

I couldn't muster a response, nor could I find a single word that would express the betrayal, the hurt, and the sheer devastation that was tearing me apart.

I just sat there, numb, staring at the man who had once meant everything to me, now reduced to a stranger.

""Get home safe,"" he muttered, barely even glancing my way as he stood up and quickly walked away, like if he couldn't get away from me fast enough.

I watched him go and realized, with a strange detachment, that tears had started to stream down my face.

I took a shaky breath, trying to stop myself from crying, but the tears kept coming as the words, ""someone like you,"" kept repeating in my head, over and over.

Chapter 2

Riley.

I pulled into the long driveway of my family house, parked the car, and took a deep breath, trying to keep myself calm.

My eyes still hurt from crying, and I knew my face was probably a mess. I quickly wiped at my cheeks with my sleeve to remove any remnants of my tears, hoping I looked somewhat presentable.

I didn't want anyone to see me like this.

Thankfully, it was late enough that I assumed everyone would be in their rooms by now, so the plan was to slip upstairs to my own bedroom and fall apart in private.

I didn't want to explain what had happened and just wanted to be alone.

I opened the front door quietly, stepping inside the foyer, and tiptoed toward the staircase, hoping to make it to my room unseen, when a figure stepped out of nowhere, blocking my way.

It was one of the house servants, Nora, who had a polite and serious look on her face.

""Miss Riley,"" she said calmly, ""your mother has requested to see you in her room.""

I stared at her, the words taking a moment to register, and when they did, my heart sank.

The last thing I needed right now was a meeting with Claire Morgan. My mother's summons rarely meant anything good, especially when she insisted on seeing me in private.

The few times she'd called me to her room like this, it was to lecture me, to criticize some perceived flaw or failing, and tonight, I wasn't sure I had the strength to face her scrutiny.

""Can't it wait until tomorrow?"" I asked. I knew it was unfair to snap at Nora since she was only a messenger, but I couldn't help it.

""I'm sorry, Miss Riley, but I'm only following instructions, and your mother was quite clear with hers,"" she responded, indirectly trying to let me know that skipping the meeting wasn't an option.

I let out a long, tired sigh in response, knowing it was utterly useless to argue. My mother never gave an order she didn't expect to be obeyed immediately.

""Fine,"" I muttered, waving the servant away. ""I'll go.""

I felt like I was walking towards my own execution as I made my way down the hallway to my mother's room.

Now standing outside my mother's door, I took a deep breath before knocking, and as soon as my knuckles tapped the door, Claire called out. ""Come in.""

I opened the door and stepped inside, bracing myself for whatever backhanded comment she might throw my way.

I couldn't remember the last time Claire Morgan had said anything kind to me, but there had been a time when things were different, though.

When Claire and Roman, my dad, adopted me at five, they'd been almost impossibly loving, and for three beautiful years, I was the center of their world.

They treated me like I was the best thing that had ever happened to them, showering me with love, and I'd felt safe and wanted. Then Claire got pregnant, and everything changed.

I still remember how thrilled I was when Evelyn was born. I'd felt so proud to have a baby sister, someone to look out for, and for a while, nothing seemed to change.

Claire and Roman still treated me kindly, though there was a subtle shift in how much attention they gave me. I noticed it, but I was too happy to care since I was just as in love with baby Evelyn as they were.

But as the years passed, the changes became even more obvious. Claire and Roman were a lot colder, and it had hurt, but I told myself it was just in my head. So I tried to ignore it and pretend that everything was as it had always been.

The real turning point came on my eighteenth birthday, fourteen years ago. I'd had a small argument with Evelyn—she was only eight at the time, and it was something petty, but it was enough to permanently ruin the bond Claire and I had.

That day, she pulled me aside, reminded me that I was adopted, and that I should be grateful they had taken me in and given me a life.

Ever since then, she had taken every opportunity to remind me that I wasn't really a part of their family, and she never missed a chance to emphasize that my life was a gift she had given me and a gift I should constantly feel indebted for.

""Close the door behind you,"" Claire said, breaking me out of my thoughts.

I did as she asked, quietly shutting the door and turning to face her. She was seated in her armchair by the window with her back straight and her expression as unreadable as ever.

""Sit down,"" she said, gesturing to the chair across from her, and I took a seat without question.

""You're back late,"" she pointed out, her tone flat.

She didn't ask where I'd been, nor did she show any sign of concern. It was just a statement, an opening remark to whatever lecture she'd summoned me here for.

""Yes,"" I replied, keeping my tone as neutral as possible.

She studied me for a moment, her eyes narrowing slightly. ""You've been crying,"" she said.

I was a little taken aback that she noticed, but then again, she had always been quite observant. ""It was a long day.""

She didn't react. ""Why? Did something happen with Grayson?""

The fact that she mentioned his name so suddenly was another surprise, but I didn't dare to ask her why she was asking.

""He ended things,"" I said simply, unwilling to share more than the bare minimum.

""Hmm,"" she murmured, not a hint of surprise in her tone. ""I suppose it was only a matter of time.""

""And what's that supposed to mean?"" I questioned sharply.

She shrugged. ""It's no secret that his family had higher expectations, and they weren't likely to let him settle down with someone like you, were they?""

I scoffed, the sound slipping out before I could stop it. Someone like me, she'd said, and it was almost laughable at this point.

Part of me wanted to snap back and tell her that I was done with her not-so-subtle reminders that I was and would always be an outsider, but I swallowed the words, biting my anger.

""Why did you call for me?"" I asked.

Claire sighed and stood up, brushing imaginary dust off her skirt. She began to pace, a habit of hers, when she was working herself up to something.

""Now that you're no longer wasting your time with a man who never intended to marry you, we can move on to more productive matters,"" she said, pausing to look at me. ""It's time you marry into a family that will accept you.""

I frowned, taken aback. ""What are you talking about?""

She flashed a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""We've received a marriage offer, Riley, and now that you're single, it's only logical that it goes to you. So instead of crying over spilled milk, you should be preparing to meet your future in-laws.""

""A marriage offer? I just told you about my breakup, and now you're already deciding my next relationship for me?"" I let out a short, disbelieving laugh. ""And why me? What about Evelyn? As far as I know, she's still single. So why not offer her up?""

""Oh, Evelyn is getting married soon,"" she replied, as if I should have known. ""So you're the one who'll marry into the family that's made the proposal.""

I blinked. ""Evelyn is getting married?"" I asked. ""How? When? How come I'm only hearing about this now?""

She shrugged. ""It doesn't matter. The point is, she's not available, which leaves you.""

""But why do you get to decide that?"" I shot back. ""Why do I have to marry someone I've never met just because you want me to?""

She raised an eyebrow, the smallest hint of a sneer tugging at her lips. ""Don't try to be ungrateful, Riley. I'm doing you a favor here. This family is willing to overlook the fact that you're adopted, and they don't care about where you came from. They value the Morgan name, and they're willing to take you as you are. Do you really think you'd get an offer like this on your own?""

I clenched my fists. ""A favor? Is that what you call this?"" I scoffed. ""Are you even considering the fact that I just got out of a long-term relationship? Are you even considering how I'm feeling right now, mom?""

She rolled her eyes, waving a hand dismissively. ""You're making this far more dramatic than it needs to be, Riley. You should be thanking me for finding you a match with a family that's willing to accept you. I know you're still upset about Grayson, but you need to put that behind you. In two days, you'll be meeting your future husband's family, so cry all you want tonight, but after today, prepare yourself.""

""This isn't fair,"" I whispered, even though I knew she wouldn't care.

She let out a sigh, crossing her arms. ""Life isn't fair, Riley. You, of all people, should know that by now. You were given a place in this family, a chance to live a life most people could only dream of, and now is the time for you to do your duty as one of us. Don't make me regret taking you in.""

Chapter 3

Riley.

I was seated in the living room of the Montgomery mansion, but I still couldn't believe I was there.

The news had been dropped on me just this morning—who the family was that I was being married off to. I'd asked Claire countless times, but she had refused to say anything until the last minute.

At first, I didn't really care to know. What did it matter who they were? It wasn't as if I had a choice in the matter, but this morning, my curiosity had gotten the better of me.

I asked her again, and she'd barely looked up from her coffee when she told me. ""It's the Montgomery family.""

The Montgomerys. One of the most powerful families in the country.

Of course, Claire would aim high. It wouldn't be enough for her to marry me off to someone with a decent name or a respectable fortune.

No, it had to be the Montgomerys—people who were practically untouchable. People who had the kind of influence that could make or break a person with a single phone call.

The name alone had been enough to make me sit up straighter. I knew of the Montgomerys; everyone did, but I wanted to know more, so on the way here, I'd pulled out my phone and done a quick search.

There were three Montgomery siblings: two sons and a daughter, and according to the articles I found, one of the sons was blind.

The details were almost nonexistent, but there were enough pieces to put together a rough picture. Apparently, he had been married once, but his wife had died a few years ago, and there were no pictures of him—only a vague description and some bits of gossip.

I did manage to find a picture of the other son, Tyler Montgomery, and I immediately assumed he was the one I'd be marrying.

Tyler was twenty-eight, four years younger than I was, and he wasn't bad-looking, objectively speaking, but he had the kind of face you might expect from someone who had grown up knowing he could get whatever he wanted.

Slicked-back blond hair, sharp features, and a smug smile that seemed permanently etched on his face.

I couldn't imagine a more ill-suited match. Tyler looked like the type who thought the world was his playground, and the thought of being tied to someone like that made my stomach turn.

I could already picture the smirk he'd wear and the casual way he'd dismiss me because I wasn't what he really wanted. It all just felt like some sick joke, like I was being set up to fail from the very start, and yet, here I was, waiting for the Montgomerys to appear and waiting to be presented like some prize they'd won in a raffle.

Claire sat beside me, her face calm and composed, as if this were just another day and another business deal she was overseeing.

After what felt like an eternity of awkward silence, the door to the living room finally opened. A woman stepped in, and I recognized her immediately: Gianna Montgomery. She was exactly as I'd imagined—young and stunningly beautiful.

From the brief research I'd managed to do, I knew that Ryan Montgomery was a two-time divorcee, and Gianna was his third and current wife, and she was only three years older than me.

She flashed a smile as she approached, the kind that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Thank you both for coming,"" she said smoothly, her gaze sliding over to me with an assessing look. ""It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Riley.""

""Likewise,"" I replied, trying to sound polite.

Gianna turned to Claire, her smile widening just a fraction. ""I trust your daughter has been well-informed,"" she said, her tone almost too casual. ""She knows what to expect.""

I was immediately confused. Knows what to expect? What did she mean by that? I opened my mouth to speak, but Claire cut me off.

""Of course,"" she replied. ""You have nothing to worry about, Gianna. Riley is also obedient and knows how to follow instructions. She'll do exactly as she's told.""

The way she spoke about me, as if I weren't even in the room, made my blood boil, but I kept calm even though deep down, I was seething.

Gianna turned back to me. ""Well, Riley, my stepson is in his room. I'll have someone escort you upstairs to see him now.""

I blinked, my mind racing to catch up with what she'd just said. ""Excuse me?""

Claire immediately glared at me, and I bit my tongue hard, willing myself to swallow my frustration, and muttered an apology. ""I'm sorry,"" I said.

Gianna looked amused, and a light chuckle slipped from her lips. ""Don't be so afraid, dear,"" she said, her tone light and almost mocking. ""Nothing will happen to you.""

Her words did little to calm me; if anything, they only deepened my confusion. Afraid? I thought. Was there something I should be afraid of? The question burned at the back of my mind, but I kept my gaze fixed on my hands, clenched tightly in my lap.

I stole a glance at Claire, silently pleading for some kind of explanation, but she wouldn't even look at me.

Gianna called over a servant with a subtle flick of her wrist, and the young woman, who couldn't have been much older than I was, leaned down as Gianna whispered something into her ear.

The servant nodded briskly before turning her attention to me. ""Miss Riley,"" she said, her voice polite but devoid of warmth, ""please follow me.""

My heart thudded in my chest as I stood up, smoothing down the skirt of my dress with trembling hands.

I took in a shaky breath, forcing myself to follow behind the servant as we made our way out of the room, and with every step, the knot of anxiety in my stomach tightened. The staircase seemed to go on forever, and I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer size and luxury of the place.

It was like stepping into another world, one where power and wealth were as natural as breathing.

I realized I had been so absorbed in the spectacle that I hadn't noticed the servant had stopped walking.

""We're here,"" she said, and I snapped back to the present.

My nerves came back, stronger than ever, as I stared at the door in front of me. The servant's expression shifted, and for a moment, I could have sworn there was pity in her eyes.

""Good luck,"" she whispered, almost too softly to hear, before turning and disappearing back down the hallway.

I swallowed hard and forced myself to lift my hand and knock. I waited, straining to hear any response from inside. Silence. I knocked again, harder this time. Still nothing.

With a deep breath, I turned the knob and pushed the door open, stepping into the room. My eyes scanned the space as I held my breath. I noticed an armchair by a window and saw that there was a figure seated in it.

""Hello?"" I said.

The chair shifted slightly, the man sitting in it turned to face me, and my heart immediately leapt to my throat. He was not what I'd expected at all.

His dark hair fell in loose waves around his face, and his eyes—strikingly blue—met mine with an intensity that rooted me to the spot, but there was something else, something that caught me off guard. His gaze was unfocused, and I realized with a start that this was the blind son I'd read about.

The man I was supposed to marry was not Tyler but his blind older brother, Adrian Montgomery.

Chapter 4

Riley.

I stared at Adrian Montgomery, rooted to the spot by the shock of seeing him in person. Besides the fact that I was blindsided to learn he was the one I was supposed to marry, I was stunned by his looks.

It felt wrong to compare him to his brother, but as good-looking as Tyler had seemed in pictures, he didn't come close to Adrian.

Adrian looked like he'd been sculpted by a master artist—a strong jaw, dark hair that framed his face, and an intensity that radiated from him even in silence. His presence was striking, magnetic, and intimidating all at once.

His blue, unfocused eyes were fixed in my direction, though I knew he couldn't see me.

Was this why the servant had wished me luck? Because he was blind? Did they all think I'd be too shallow to handle it, that I'd run from him because he couldn't see me? If that was their assumption, they clearly didn't know me.

Sure, the whole situation was awful, and the idea of being forced into marriage was something I hated with every fiber of my being, but I wouldn't run from him simply because he was blind. That was not who I was, and judging by the way he sat there silently, his face closed off, I wondered if he was waiting for me to speak.

Clearing my throat, I managed a small smile. ""Hello,"" I said. ""I'm Riley. Gianna sent me up here to meet you.""

Silence filled the room, and I wasn't sure what I expected—a polite response, an awkward exchange, maybe even some stiff small talk, but instead, his expression hardened, his entire body stiffening in a way that made my instincts scream at me to take a step back.

""Get out,"" he growled.

The sound was rough and thunderous, carrying anger that was unmistakable. His tone was so harsh, so unexpectedly hostile, that I physically jolted, my pulse spiking as I felt his words hit me.

I stood frozen, completely unprepared for the intensity of his reaction. He looked furious, and his posture was rigid, as though my mere presence was an offense.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I realized, with sudden clarity, why the servant had wished me luck. This wasn't just about his blindness; Adrian Montgomery was a raging bull.

I struggled to keep my composure and to gather myself before I spoke again. I took a deep breath. ""Adrian, I just wanted—""

Before I could even finish my sentence, something small and heavy flew across the room. I barely had time to register anything before the object—a small vase—whizzed past my head, close enough that I felt the rush of air as it flew by.

It crashed against the wall behind me with a loud thud, sending shards of glass scattering to the floor.

I gasped, stumbling back instinctively, my eyes wide with shock, and my heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst from my chest. I looked at him, breathing heavily, the reality of what had just happened hitting me hard. He'd thrown it. He'd actually thrown something at me.

My body shook, a mix of fear and disbelief settling over me. I wanted to run, to bolt from the room and never look back, but something kept me there, rooted in place. Maybe it was stubbornness, maybe it was anger, but I wasn't going to let him scare me off.

I swallowed, trying to steady my voice, though it trembled as I spoke. ""What was that for?""

His expression remained stony, his jaw clenched tightly. There was a brief flicker of something in his face—regret, maybe?—but it was gone in an instant, replaced by that same hardened look.

""I told you to get out,"" he said coldly. ""I don't need a babysitter, and I certainly don't need a wife forced on me.""

I scoffed as the realization dawned on me—Adrian's aggression came from the same place as my own anger, and he hated being forced into this as much as I did.

Folding my arms across my chest, I met his unseeing blue eyes with a stubborn glare. ""You know, just like you don't want a babysitter or a wife forced on you, I don't want to be anyone's babysitter or forced into marriage either.""

Adrian's scowl deepened, his jaw tightening as he leaned forward slightly. ""Who's forcing you to be here, then? Because I'm pretty sure you were ecstatic about the idea of marrying a Montgomery,"" he sneered. ""I bet you're already convincing yourself it doesn't matter that I'm blind—as long as I'm a Montgomery, that's all you need, right?""

I rolled my eyes. ""Please,"" I spat, the word heavy with sarcasm. ""I couldn't care less about your last name. My being here is entirely against my will.""

His mouth twisted into a bitter smile, but there was something in his expression that told me he wasn't convinced.

I felt even more frustrated, and before I knew it, I was blurting out the thoughts I'd been trying to hold back since I walked through that door.

""Do you have any idea how ridiculous this is for me?"" I said. ""I can't believe my life has come to this—reduced to being called a gold digger by some rich idiot who assumes I'm here just because of his last name.""

My voice trembled, and for a minute, I didn't care if I was oversharing or if he thought I was being dramatic.

I was tired, so darn tired, of pretending to be okay with everything that was happening. ""I haven't even had the time to process getting dumped by my boyfriend of three years for being adopted before I was thrown into this madness, and now I'm here, facing accusations of being a gold digger when all I want is to run as far away from this as possible.""

My chest rose and fell rapidly, and it wasn't until the last word left my lips that I realized how far I'd gone, and I glanced at Adrian, my face burning with embarrassment.

To my surprise, he was no longer scowling. His arms were crossed, but he was leaning back in the chair now with an amused look on his face.

""Did I hear that right?"" he asked, an eyebrow quirking up. ""You were dumped because you were adopted?""

I felt my face grow hotter, and I instinctively looked away.

Great, I thought; now he knows just how pathetic my life has become. But since I'd already put it out there, there was no use trying to backtrack.

I swallowed as I forced myself to respond. ""Yes,"" I said, the word barely audible. ""I was.""

Adrian tilted his head slightly, and the amusement faded from his features, replaced by something I couldn't quite identify.

""I'm so pathetic and useless that my boyfriend—my ex-boyfriend—didn't think I was good enough for marriage because I don't even know where I come from, and now, my adopted mother is forcing me into this marriage because she believes I owe her for being kind enough to adopt a nobody like me.""

I felt the hot sting of tears well up in my eyes, and before I knew it, they were slipping down my Feeling embarrassed, I forced myself to look away from Adrian, ashamed of breaking down in front of him.

He was still a stranger to me, and here I was, crying like a fool. Judging by the slight shift in his expression, he could hear the sounds of my sobs, and that realization only made me more self-conscious.

Quickly, I wiped at my cheeks, brushing away the tears and forcing myself to take deep breaths.

""Look, I'm just going to go,"" I managed, trying to sound strong, though my words came out shaky. ""You can tell your family whatever you want—that I smell bad or that I'm rude or whatever excuse you can think of to call this whole thing off.""

I let out a short, humorless laugh. ""It's not like I have the power to refuse it myself.""

I was ready to turn and leave, to escape before I humiliated myself further, when I heard it—a short, low laugh. It was unexpected, and for a moment, it didn't register that it came from Adrian, but there he was, a small smile breaking the severe lines of his face.

The change was breathtaking, the hint of warmth making him look even more striking, if that were possible.

I blinked, shaking myself out of the moment. 'Don't get distracted,' I scolded myself. I turned to go, my hand already on the door handle, but Adrian's voice stopped me in my tracks.

""Let's get married, Riley.""

I froze, certain I'd misheard him. Slowly, I turned back to face him, my brows knitted together in confusion. ""I'm sorry, what did you just say?""

Adrian leaned forward in his chair, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly. There was a spark of challenge in his unfocused eyes, as if he could see more than I gave him credit for.

""You heard me,"" he said. ""I said, let's get married. I'd like to marry you.""

Chapter 5

Riley's POV.

I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. Adrian Montgomery, the man who minutes ago had thrown a vase at me and told me to get out of his room, had now calmly declared that he'd like to marry me.

Confusion swirled through my mind, and I stared at him, trying to make sense of what he'd just said. Surely, I'd misheard.

""Did you just say…"" I trailed off. I swallowed hard and forced myself to speak again, louder this time. ""Did you just say you'd like to marry me?""

Adrian nodded, his expression calm, almost casual. ""Yes, that's exactly what I said.""

I blinked at him, waiting for some kind of explanation, something that would make this moment less absurd. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, his posture relaxed, as though we were discussing something as trivial as the weather.

""Of course,"" he added, ""I'm not a tyrant like my family—or yours, for that matter. I'm not going to demand that you marry me just because I've changed my mind.""

My mouth fell open, but no words came out. Was he serious? He couldn't be serious, but then he continued, his tone so nonchalant that it only made me feel more off-kilter.

""If you don't mind being married to a blind man,"" he said with a shrug, ""then yes, I would like to marry you.""

I stared at him, utterly speechless. My brain struggled to process what he was saying, and for a few seconds, I just stood there, frozen. Adrian remained seated, his head tilted slightly toward me, his expression unreadable. He looked so at ease, like he wasn't even aware of the chaos he'd just unleashed in my mind.

When I finally found my voice again, it came out shaky and uncertain. ""Why?"" I asked. ""What suddenly made you change your mind? Is it because…"" I hesitated, the words bitter on my tongue. ""Is it because you pity me? Because I mentioned being adopted and forced into this? Am I suddenly a charity case?""

Adrian's expression shifted slightly, his relaxed demeanor giving way to something more thoughtful. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. ""Pity you?"" he repeated. ""No, Riley, I don't pity you. I don't think you'd want that, and I'm in no position to pity anyone.""

He was right, of course. The last thing I wanted was anyone's pity, least of all his, but his answer didn't explain why he was now proposing marriage after all the hostility he'd shown earlier.

""Then why?"" I pressed. ""You made it pretty clear that you didn't want anything to do with me earlier. So why the sudden change?""

Adrian's lips curved into a faint smile, though there was no humor in it. ""Let's just say I had a moment of clarity,"" he replied, his tone cryptic. He gestured vaguely toward the seat across from him. ""Sit down, Riley. You're making me feel like I've cornered you.""

Without thinking, the words tumbled out of my mouth. ""No offense, Adrian, but it's not like you can see me, so why does it matter if I sit or not?""

I instantly regretted it, cringing at how flippant I sounded, but Adrian's reaction wasn't what I expected. Instead of being upset at me, he chuckled softly, the sound rich and surprisingly warm. ""No offense taken,"" he said smoothly. ""And if you'd rather stand, by all means, be my guest.""

His calm response caught me off guard, and I hesitated for a moment, debating whether to keep standing out of sheer stubbornness, but eventually, I sighed and sat down across from him.

My curiosity outweighed my pride. ""Fine, I'll sit. Now, can you explain to me why you suddenly changed your mind? What's this 'moment of clarity'you mentioned?""

Adrian tilted his head slightly, his expression thoughtful. For a few long seconds, he stayed silent, and I thought maybe he was trying to decide how much to tell me. Finally, he cleared his throat and leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees.

""Alright,"" he began. ""You're not the first candidate my family has brought to me as a potential wife, and, if things don't work out between us, you won't be the last.""

I frowned, taken aback by his bluntness. The way he said it made it sound like some kind of audition process. ""How many candidates are we talking about here?"" I asked.

Adrian shrugged, his expression neutral. ""Enough. Enough to know the pattern.""

""Pattern?"" I echoed, leaning forward slightly. ""What pattern?""

He let out a dry chuckle, though there was no humor in it. ""The pattern where every single one of them makes it painfully obvious that the only reason they're willing to marry me—despite knowing they might have to babysit me because of my condition—is because I'm a Montgomery with billions to my name.""

I could hear the bitterness under his calm tone, a frustration that had clearly been building for a long time. It made sense, in a way. He was wealthy, powerful, and blind—an easy target for anyone looking to secure a comfortable life, even if it meant pretending to care about him.

""So…"" I said cautiously, furrowing my brows. ""You think I'm different from the rest?""

Adrian turned his head slightly toward me, his lips curving into a faint smile. ""That's what I'm trying to figure out.""

His answer didn't give me much to work with, and I couldn't tell if he was being genuine or just toying with me. ""And what makes you think I'm any different?"" I pressed, crossing my arms. ""I mean, you don't know me. For all you know, I could be just as shallow as the others.""

Adrian chuckled again, though this time, it was softer, almost amused. ""True,"" he admitted. ""But there's something about the way you yelled at me earlier that doesn't quite scream'gold digger.' Usually, they try to act all polite to win my favor, but you didn't.""

I felt my face flush at the reminder of my earlier rant. ""That wasn't exactly my finest moment,"" I muttered, looking away.

""No, it wasn't,"" he agreed, and I heard the faintest hint of a smirk in his voice. ""But it was honest, and honesty is a rare commodity in my world.""

I found myself unsure of how to respond. Honesty. Was that really all it took for him to reconsider, or was there something more he wasn't saying?

""And what if I'm just a really good actor?"" I asked, half-joking but genuinely curious.

Adrian's smile widened slightly. ""Then I guess we'll find out, won't we?""

I narrowed my eyes at him, trying to gauge his expression, but he remained as calm and unreadable as ever. There was something about him—something disarming yet guarded—that made it hard to figure out what he was really thinking.

Part of me wanted to press him further, to demand a straight answer, but another part of me wondered if I even wanted to know.

""And what happens if I say no?"" I asked quietly, meeting his gaze. ""What happens if I decide I'd rather walk away? Did you mean it when you said that I could? Can I really choose to walk away?""

Adrian's expression didn't change, but there was a flicker of something in his eyes—understanding, maybe? ""Of course you can, Riley,"" he said simply. ""I won't stop you. I'm not your mother, Riley. I won't force you into anything you don't want.""

His words were sincere, and for the first time since meeting him, I felt a small sense of comfort.

""I'll think about it,"" I said finally.

This happened recently—my partner and I came home late because we were out with friends for coffee and drinks until 3 a.m. We're already in our 30s, we have jobs, and we contribute to the household. But my partner’s parents still don’t allow us to go out. Their rule is to go straight home after work because they think we’re doing drugs whenever we’re outside.

So when we got home, it turned into a mess—drama, shouting, and someone even had a hysterical breakdown saying we should just leave. That’s when we decided, okay, we really will move out. But they were shocked when we said we wouldn’t be giving financial support for now because we needed to save up a bit to move out. Then they got angry again—saying we were disrespectful, that I’m a bad influence, and ever since I came into my partner’s life, I’ve ruined them.

Which is funny because long before I came along, my partner was just stuck in their room. They were surprised when I started inviting my partner to go out, and I could see that they were actually enjoying it. But the parents can’t take the changes they’re seeing. They think I’m a terrible person pulling their child away from them. The mother has even said several times that I’m “doing drugs.”

 if you saw me, you might even mistake me for a kid. It’s just really sad.

So, for context, I'm studying geology and I needed extra help with maths and physics this year. I found another student from the double degree in maths and physics who has been helping me since the very beginning. He's been like a light in my life these past few months, so I wanted to show him my gratitude/appreciation and I already prepared a gift for him (I haven't given it to him yet) and I'm deeply insecure/self conscious about what he might think. I don't know if it's dumb or ""excessive"".

As for the gift, since I don't know him personally besides the lessons he gave me, I thought I'd buy something that's related to that (to what he studies) so I searched ""cool gifts for physicists"" (I know it sounds stupid) but I found many people talking about how cool it'd be to receive a ""coffee mug Stirling engine"" as a physics undergraduate (I had other options like a plasma globe but I didn't want to give something that requires external energy to function) so I went for the first option instead, and I got him a coffee mug with maths equations as a complementary gift as well. 

None of that seemed like ""enough"" to me, I wanted to make it more special and personal so I added a handwritten letter, letting him know why I'm doing this and telling him how much I appreciate what he's done for me. I also added some cool rocks (my special interest) that have physical properties like light refraction, so I thought it'd be more cohesive and a way of connecting what I study with what he studies, plus giving it more of a personal/emotional touch. And added some sweet treats as well so that he can enjoy them while opening everything. 

I personally think it's a really nice, heartfelt and thoughtful thing to do for someone else, but I'm just unsure if it could come across as excessive or as ""crazy"". I just get very emotionally involved with people that I find special to me, and I want to show him that I really appreciate everything that he's done for me. (He was a very big emotional support as well when I had mental breakdowns, so that's why he's become so important to me.) 

What do you think? Would you freak out if you received a gift like this out of the sudden? Or you'd appreciate it and think it's nice? ",3,1746271041.0,Physics,1,1.0,False

He came in a few weeks ago and fully embodied my whole “build the parachute on the way down” ethos.

He didn’t worry about gettin’ a website fixed up.

He didn’t worry about makin’ sure his android was all tested and squeaky clean before reaching out to potential partners.

He just went out there and did it!

Talking to folks, reaching out to his network, finding peeps who have any sorta leads and need help turning them into sales.

Marcus locked in 3 coffee dates over 3 days… and closed every single one of them.

Then…

A week later, he closed 3 DEALS in ONE coffee date!

I keep tellin you guys…

What we’re teaching works.

You just gotta do it and stop dilly dallying, waiting for the right time, waiting for things to be set up and perfect before you can do XYZ.

The ONLY thing that matters is getting coffee dates locked in.

And this is what folks like Rob Brown did, who was able to quit his 9-5 within 30 days back in January and is now pulling 8-figs in his first year.

1kdql80,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddictsindia/comments/1kdql80/what_i_learnt_in_a_year_of_skincare/,What I learnt in a year of skincare,"Here is a list of what I think are the most important things in a skincare routine with some other info

1) genes
2) exercise 
3) sunscreen 
4) moisturizer 
5) exfoliants
6) actives
7)cleanser


1)) Genes : well can't help it. Some people's skin never gets affected no matter what and others are ruined even with 2 mins of sun exposure.

2))exercise : improves circulation. Nutrition reaches your skin. No topical ingredients can beat this.


3))Sunscreen: ( the most important topical. Prevents tan, aging, wrinkles and all the sun damage. If you are starting skincare this is the first product you need. And sunscreen filters are hard to make. So don't hesitate in buying the costly sunscreens. Sunscreen is 80% of your skincare. So don't hesitate to use 80% of your budget in getting your sunscreen.)

A) physical ( contain zinc oxide, titanium oxide) : these sunscreens protects your skin by forming a layer ON TOP OF your skin. So apply it to form a layer over your skin and don't rub it into your skin. Since it forms a layer on top, physical sunscreens should be last step of your routine since it can block your other actives to penetrate into your skin. Also using these sunscreens WILL have a white cast because of their filters.

B) chemical (avobenxone, oxybenzone, octinoxate) : penetrates the skin, so needs to be rubbed into the skin. And  if you like applying moisturizer before sunscreens, well not here because the chemical sunscreen needs to penetrate the skin. So chemical sunscreen goes before the moisturizer.

4))Moisturizer:

1)occlusives( seals the skin moisture eg: your petroleum jelly like Vaseline) : so use it when your skin is already hydrated or just after washing your face. Makes skin oily and dirt sticks to your face. But good when it's windy or you are travelling on bike.

2)humectants( hydrates skin like hyaluronic acid, glycerin) : use when your face is dry.


5))Exfoliants:

physical: scrubs like coffee powder, walnut scrubs. Well don't use physical scrubs on face.

Chemical: aha, bha

AHA: ( quickest method to clear your skin, but makes skin more sensitive to sun for few days)

( removes the top dead  layer eg: glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid)

Since it basically scraps off the top layer off your skin it makes you more sensitive to sun. So use it on days when you are unlikely to have sun exposure or after your trip. 


BHA:( helps to unclog pores eg salicylic acid ) : best for acne as it is caused by clogged pores in most cases. And also used for black heads

6))Actives: the main ingredient of your creams like aha/ bha, niacinamide, kojic acid, retinols etc

This involves all the ingredients targeted at your concerns.


++

-moisturizer is a MUST for oily skin. Because oily skin is  basically your skin struggling for hydration. 

Aha used for dry skin: aha acts like a humectant and hydrates the skin.

**Garbage collection**
Yesterday, immediately after trash collection, I noticed that my Herbie was not on the curb where I left it, and I checked all the neighbors cans and it was not with them.  I noticed it immediately after the trash truck was in front of my house.  I don't know what happened to it.  I do need a replacement, please.  Thank you.

1kdqkvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kdqkvo/my_journey_quitting_for_good/,My Journey & Quitting For Good,"I am at the point where even a regular 2 OUNCES of coffee a day wrecks my sleep and energy levels. Here is a brief rundown of my journey with caffeine. 

-My junior year in high school, I would get a caramel Frappuccino once a week before school. That summer, I vowed to not have any Starbucks and I lost 10lbs (from cutting a once a week Frappuccino!). 

-In college, I had phases of daily large black coffees and skinny vanilla lattes from Starbucks. I looked at coffee as a weight loss tool for a while. I then almost always needed alcohol to help me fall asleep. Anxiety was really bad as well. 

-After college, anxiety and chronic gut issues got really bad so I quit caffeine for a few years. 

-Got back into drinking small amounts of coffee 7 years ago when I started my first full time office job. And I had a brief stint of drinking Celsius (I never drank a whole can). 

-I think it’s been in the past 3-5 years that I’ve been consciously thinking about quitting caffeine for good. I’ll go for a week or two and then think just a little won’t hurt and fall back into it. I find it funny when people decide to switch to green tea because green tea always makes the caffeine highs and lows and withdrawals much worse for me. 

I’m at the point now where even the smallest amounts of coffee, even chocolate, will make me not feel good and mess with my sleep and energy levels. Not sure if I’ve developed a sensitivity/allergy or if it has to do with getting a little older (35F). Whenever I quit for a week or more, I feel incredible. 

I want to visit this sub daily for motivation so I don’t keep falling into the same pattern. It’s like I get amnesia about how crap it makes me feel or think I’ll just have a little today and won’t have any tomorrow.

""Sorry, Officer Stanaway. I don't date right now. Too busy.""

""Come on, sweetie. Just a cup of coffee."" He grabs my arm so tightly that I can't escape.

Suddenly, I feel someone coming up behind me.

""It's illegal and unethical, isn't it, Officer Stanaway?"" says a very deep and rumbling voice from right behind me.

""Sorry, I didn't realize she was one of yours."" Officer Stanaway cringes back, then starts the car and slowly pulls away.

I turn around, see a biker standing directly behind me, with longish black hair, tanned, muscular, tattooed arms, and a face the angels must have created themselves.

God! I feel like I'm falling in love...

Ava

Ughhh! I'm so tired of this neighbor of mine. He whines about everything. My music is too loud, my cat stares at his house from the back of my couch, and the dog looked at him in a funny way. He complained last week that my dog gave him an ""I'm going to kill and bury you in the backyard"" look, and he said it with a straight face. And he called the cops telling them the same thing. Don't even get me started on what he thinks of my Macaw and pig. You'd think we lived in downtown New York instead of living on the outskirts of Denver. It doesn't matter that I've been extremely nice and have tried befriending him. He's still a class-A jerk.

""Loki, come. Out the back door for you, big guy,"" I say to my beautiful Native American dog as I stand holding the sliding glass door open. He walks by with that sad dog look he has perfected and goes through the door into my fenced backyard. We were in the front yard planting flowers along my sidewalk. It's not fenced, but Loki never left my side. He seldom does due to being very overprotective. Apparently, that doesn't register with my neighbor. All he noticed was Loki off-leash, looking his direction and that was enough to scream that he was calling the police. Then he ran for his house. He's such a dramatic little bimbo.

So now I'm back to planting my flowers, waiting for the police to show up again. Not something I'm looking forward to either. I'm not a cop-hater, but I'm not a fan. Growing up in the foster care system doesn't make you fond of the government, caseworkers or cops. There are good ones out there, but they are outnumbered by the bad ones it seems. I have other reasons for distrusting cops, but I work hard at keeping those memories buried deep.

While crouched down patting the dirt around the base of the plant, I hear the unmistakable sound of a Harley. Actually, I hear a few of them. The house next to my annoying neighbor belongs to an older, big, tattooed biker which puts his house across the street and at an angle to mine. He's seldom around and keeps to himself, but I get a shiver every time I hear his Harley coming down the street. Not from fear but excitement. I love that sound. Throaty, deep rumbling with a side of attitude. Once again, I think maybe I should buy one for myself. But I know nothing about them or how to ride one, just that I love the sound.

I look toward the road and see four bikes being followed by a truck. They drive past and pull into my biker neighbor's driveway. The lead bike was a black matte and chrome beast ridden by a huge man with longish black hair, tanned, muscular, tattooed arms and a face the angels must have created themselves. He has shades on, so I didn't get to see his whole face, but what I saw was spectacular. I am close enough to the road to see the small smirk and chin lift aimed in my direction as he rode past.

Jesus! I think I just came a little. It's been too long, way too long, since anyone has caught my attention in that way. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's never happened before. But watching him dismount the bike is like watching biker porn. I can't seem to pull my eyes away from those huge thighs and tight hips. This man is pure muscle, and did I mention huge? Two minutes of watching him, and I have rub club material for the next month.

""I don't need a man. I don't need a man. I don't want a man. I don't want a man,"" I whisper to myself repeatedly as nefarious thoughts enter my head. But even as I'm saying this, I'm still staring at the big biker dude. Then I notice he has taken off his sunglasses and is staring back at me. Wowzer! I didn't think he could get any hotter, but I was so wrong. No idea what color his eyes are, but he is simply gorgeous. I think I'm drooling a bit. But I know it's all fantasy. I'm not a one-night-stand kind of girl, and he's definitely a hit-it and quit-it kind of guy.

1kdqivi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dionysus/comments/1kdqivi/a_reading_tale/,A Reading Tale," Hi, this is my first EVER post on reddit. I never thought that I would have the courage to do it but seeing how everyone shared their experiences so that others can learn from them and our community grow, I have decided to finally share my experience as well. I hope it reaches to someone who needs to hear it.
 So, yesterday when I was alone at the house, I have decided to finally try to commune with Dionysus. I opened my altar in my table, gifted him  tiny elephant and lit a candle. Then I got my tarot deck, sat on my bed and let my walls down.
 First, I wanted to pick a card to symbolize him. It could be any card so I went with my gut and decided on the Hanged Man. You know... for a ""different view"" regarding my question.
 I asked him about the long-distance relationship I have and the struggles that came with it. I asked him about why I didn't want to betray that trust but also thought about it being so easy to loose myself in carnal instincts. That I never new what to do with a healthy relationship when my partner was the best and I still used life as an excuse to find reasons that it would never work. That loving me was just too much for a single person to handle.
 At that point I left all my expectations behind. As with all my readings, this was a self-reflection time. So I knew EXACTLY what I was looking for. I told myself that I would try to read into whatever card I would pick and come to a similar conclusion. But deep down, I knew what I wanted.  I knew exactly which card I wanted to see out of all the 77 cards that laid face-down before me. I knew that whichever off the 76 of those I picked, I would find the answer regardless but only 1 of them would ""proove"" that he was here, that he listened and guided me.
 My left hand hovered on the face down cards and I decided.
And I flipped it.
And it was the One.
 I couldn't believe my eyes as I saw the pentacon, at the top when the card was upright, at the bottom carrying the Devil from its horns. The pair of figures, chained to him now looking at me, their wild smirks turned to sad  frowns. My fingers trembled as I screamd curses of disbelief!
 At that moment, I never felt mire close to divinity and I never believed more in me, that I always had the answers and guidences I seeked within me.
 And Dionysus was there to not to preach but to show and let me figure it out. He brought the vine to the party but it is us who decides how much and when we drink from it.
 PS: I felt like this was a particularly special moment so I also flipped a card about what the future holds and he said your hard work will pay off so...👌👌👌
 PSS: I poured coffee for us both afterwards. It was a celebration, after all.",1,1746270707.0,dionysus,0,1.0,False

They’re in my name and my address but I never ordered anything. They’re weird things and weird amounts too. For example one box was 5 things of powdered coffee creamer. Another box was multiple tubes of toothpaste. Random stuff like that with brands I definitely never use. 

I called target customer service. Confirmed that yes, the packages were addressed to me and ordered within my state. Finally they gave me a name of who ordered them, I’ll call him Mike James. I don’t know any Mike James personally but I did some digging to find out that 6 weeks ago I blocked one on Facebook. I can’t remember why exactly and I can’t see any messages between us. My best guess is he was bugging me about something I put on Facebook marketplace. 

Now I’m freaked out but I have all my social media locked down pretty tightly. My real name isn’t on facebook (I use my nickname and then my middle name instead of last). I never ever give anyone my real address to pick up what I’m selling, I use an address a few doors down. 

I can’t figure out how Mike James would have gotten my full name and address (our address also requires an apartment number). Also, why he would send me so much random crap. I unblocked him and asked if it was him but no response yet.

Using the monthly budgets for occasional larger expenses gets really annoying. For my household, that's mostly vacations and home improvement projects. 

But like if our big vacation for the year is in May and I pay for those flights in March, Monarch will send me angry reminders that I'm over my vacation budget from March though November even though we stayed in budget for the year.

Thoughts? I've seen others on here ask for this, and get told to just use rollovers. I'm considering deleting all my budgets out...

It would be ideal if I could put some things in as annual budgets and have Monarch tell me what percentage of that in have used each month.

We are currently feeding once between 730-730 but probably up 6 or so times putting the pacifier in to hold off his feeding and then to help him get back/stay back down after.  We try not to feed until 1am earliest, hopefully later.  If he wakes up before 7 (maybe 530-630) we usually try a pacifier and if that doesn’t work we hold him and he passes right out until we wake him up for the day- I just like not starting the day too early.  He does not seem starving my any means at that time since he is fully zonked out on my chest, and then when he wakes up he even takes some time to seem like he wants the bottle (ie lets me diaper change, make coffee, feed the dog as he chills before bottle).

I’ve seen the 5/3/3 rule but that seems like too much for my baby as we only feed once.  However, I don’t want to let him cry when he’s hungry.  Does this become obvious eventually?  I don’t want to go to feeding more than 1x a night since he has shown us he is totally fine waiting.

Its sleek black matte exterior blends seamlessly into my kitchen, and its promise of rich flavor extraction had me intrigued right out of the box. As someone who values a quality cup of coffee at the start of the day, I was eager to see how this programmable coffee maker would perform in my daily routine. 

**Sleek and Modern Design**  
One thing I noticed immediately is the compact design of this drip coffee machine. Measuring 8.15”D x 5”W x 12.11”H, it doesn’t hog counter space, which is perfect for my small kitchen. The minimalist black finish matches most appliances and gives it a polished look. The buttons laid out on the front are straightforward, with a digital clock that’s easy to read even during groggy mornings. It’s not flashy, but that simplicity is part of its charm.  

**User-Friendly Programming Features**  
The digital QuickTouch™ Programming feels tailor-made for rushed mornings. Setting the auto brew function takes seconds, allowing me to program it for fresh coffee at the exact time I drag myself out of bed. I also appreciate the brew strength adjustment option; on some days, I need a mild cup, while on others, a stronger brew is a must. With just a couple of presses, it adapts to my caffeine requirements without hassle.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM1110B-1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b098chh298/)  

**Vortex Technology for Rich Flavor**  
The star of this coffeemaker is undoubtedly the Vortex Technology. The unique showerhead design saturates the coffee grounds evenly, and I could genuinely taste the difference. The extraction process ensures maximum flavor, resulting in a bold and well-rounded taste whether I'm making a small batch or filling the 12-cup carafe. For coffee enthusiasts who pay attention to flavor profiles, this attention to detail is noteworthy.  

**Convenient Sneak-A-Cup Feature**  
No one likes staring at a coffee pot waiting for it to finish brewing. Thanks to the Sneak-A-Cup feature, I could pour myself a cup mid-brew without any messy spills. Of course, you have to return the carafe to the warming plate within 30 seconds, or there’s a risk of overflow—something I learned the hard way during a particularly sleepy morning. Still, it’s a game-changing feature for impatient coffee lovers like myself.  

**Strengths**  
- Digital programming for scheduled brewing makes mornings easier.  
- Vortex Technology enhances the coffee’s flavor extraction.  
- Compact and visually appealing design.  
- The Sneak-A-Cup feature is convenient for quick pours mid-brew.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- No permanent filter included; it requires paper filters, which is an ongoing expense.  
- The carafe spout design occasionally dribbles if you pour too quickly, which can be a minor annoyance.  

**Low Maintenance with a Removable Filter Basket**  
Cleanup has always been my least favorite part of brewing coffee, but the removable dishwasher-safe filter basket simplifies the process. While it works beautifully with basket-style paper filters, the lack of a reusable filter felt like a missed opportunity for added convenience and environmental friendliness.  

**Products That Compete**  
When comparing this coffee maker to other options like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the BLACK+DECKER model stands out for its rich flavor and Vortex Technology. However, Hamilton Beach offers dual brewing capability, which is better for households with diverse coffee-drinking habits. Another competitor, the Keurig K-Duo, provides single-cup brewing versatility alongside a pot, but it’s pricier. If your primary concern is a high-capacity, flavor-focused carafe, the BLACK+DECKER consistently offers good value.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
While I won’t quote the exact price, I find this machine to be budget-friendly when balanced with its features. The programmable settings, flavor-enhancing technology, and 12-cup capacity put it in competition with higher-end models at a fraction of their cost. It feels like the manufacturer invested in the parts that matter without loading it with features I wouldn’t use.

1kdq7ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1kdq7ti/we_finally_closed_the_distance_after_3_years_and/,"We finally closed the distance after 3 years, and I still can't believe he's here","Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share something that's honestly been overwhelming me in the best possible way. After three years of being in a long-distance relationship, my boyfriend and I have finally closed the distance. He's here. In the same city. In the same room. And I still wake up feeling like I'm dreaming.

We met online during the early months of the pandemic. At first, it was just casual chats, then it became long phone calls that went way past midnight, and then suddenly I realized this stranger I met on the internet meant more to me than most people in my real life.

The relationship grew fast and deep, but the distance never stopped being hard. Different time zones. Birthday video calls. Airport goodbyes that completely destroyed me every time. And those moments where we just wanted to do something totally normal like go for coffee or lie on the couch together, but we couldn’t.

Still, we made it work. Three years of visits every few months, letters in the mail, playlists sent back and forth, and more crying than I want to admit. There were times when I wasn’t sure how much longer I could take it, but we kept reminding each other that this was temporary.

And now, it's real. I’m looking over at him as I write this. We went grocery shopping together for the first time last week and it felt like a freaking honeymoon. We’ve been cooking together, watching trash TV, and just living life side by side. I know this is the boring normal stuff, but it feels absolutely magical after what we went through.

If you're still in a long-distance relationship and feeling hopeless, please know that I get it. That heaviness, that ache when you hang up the phone, the doubt that creeps in when plans get pushed back. But please also know that it really can work. You’re not crazy for trying. Love can survive all of this.

1kdq62r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1kdq62r/i_suffer_from_my_husband_admittedly_not_valuing/,I suffer from my husband admittedly not valuing intimacy.,"My husband (29) and I(30) have been married for 7 years and have one toddler and another baby on the way (due date may26th).
Throughout our marriage I’ve been labeled as the higher libido partner since I mostly initiate and constantly want/try to talk about it. It was also agreed that for me sex is one of my top priorities compared to him admitting that it’s not the case for him. If I don’t initiate, we won’t be intimate in any shape or form.. we’ve gone months in the past as I was trying to prove that point. 

I come here to ask for your honest opinion and help on how to bridge the intimacy gap between him and I because I deeply suffer from our disconnect and I don’t think he understands that I deeply desire this bond with him. 

For more context, and just to be clear we have had sex maybe 5 times since 2025 and out of 5 he initiated only once. And that’s after I complained to him that he never initiates.. 
On another hand, when we do have sex it’s robotic.. he doesn’t make love to me. I understand that sex is communication so I tried telling him what would make me happy and even wrote it down on paper, but he admitted never looking at it. I felt extremely heartbroken after that. Eventually I moved past that pain and stopped bringing that up to him with the hope that one day he might be interested and ask me again. But it never happened. 

We don’t pray together, we don’t fall asleep together, we don’t eat together.. we hang out together on dates but for some reason I still feel disconnected from him. 

He’s a great loving man and father with a lot on his plate and many hobbies. Our schedules are different. He often tells me that he needs to fill up his cup before being able to fill up mine which I agree but how much does he need? At the end of the day if he didn’t eat his 2800 cals, slept 7hours, went to the gym or worked on his motorcycle then I shouldn’t expect anything from him?? And what about when he does get his cup full? I still have to be the one initiating.

I tried everything: lingerie, sexy hot text messages to build him up, waited for him to come to bed even though I was exhausted, granted him to wake me up in the middle of the night though I can’t fall asleep afterward…at some point he set reminders on his phone but that never worked, another time he needed coffee to perform in the morning so I’d get rejected for trying knowing that he didn’t get his caffeine. 

 I really try to make it around him, moved past multiple rejection early on but the fact is, no matter what I do.. it works for some time and then he defaults back to not seeing me. 
I even tried to accept the fact that I’d always be the initiator in my marriage but I always reach a point where I start feeling like I’m not desired, adding to this the fact that when it happens, sex is like a formality for him and not love making. If he checks that box he knows he is going to have peace for some time because I won’t bring it up again. He admitted it to me that it’s a robotic thing for him like many other things in his life. 
I am even ashamed to say that sometimes when we have sex I have to think deeply of something that would truly excite me because his touch became cold to me.

TLDR: I don’t feel connected to my husband because we don’t value intimacy at the same level. I need it to bond and destress whereas it seems to be a stressor or a low priority task for him which causes him to never initiate. We’ve been talking about this issue for 7 years of our marriage (been married for 7), but I think we always default to the same situation despite everything I try to make him feel comfortable. I don’t know what to do anymore as this situation deeply hurts me and I am not sure who can help us. Maybe I am unreasonable…",3,1746269356.0,Christianmarriage,14,1.0,False
1kdq5wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bartenders/comments/1kdq5wp/ill_take_care_of_you/,"""I'll take care of you""","Of course we have all heard the ""I'll take care of you"" line when someone wants extra attentive service and gives a hefty tip to get it. In most cases on normal nights it's all fine, I'll definitely put in a little extra effort for a guaranteed extra tip. And then there are the times that its too busy to really be able to do that since it seems unfair to get other people a second or third round when someone could be waiting to get their first round and you have to learn how to shuffle them all in. 

But last night in particular was weird and I don't know how to feel about it. This group was in and had a couple tabs open for a few specific things but for the most part we're paying with cash as they go when they bought whole rounds and would add just a single drink order to the tabs. I appreciated this and they were nice but we were extremely busy and had just released our new drink menu so we are still getting used to things. 

But they tipped heft with each round so we all made sure to take care of them, but at some point things were getting confusing. They would order maybe 9-12 beers from one of us while we were doing other things, so before that person to get to grabbing those beers they would flag someone else down and say they were waiting on ""x""amount of beers, already paid for them. So then (say it's me this time) I go to confirm the amount with the other bartender. They said they bought 12 colors light. We have both can and bottle and charge the same amount for them, don't ask me why. But I only had 2 bottles left in the cooler but had plenty of cans, so I start to get out the 12 cans. They they ask for the 2 bottles. I ask if they want all bottles and I can go get more or ask the barback. They say they want bottles but cans are okay for some of the group. The barback heard my quick request for more bottles when I first noticed there's only 2 left, so he comes back with them in the amount of time it take for me to put back the 6 cans I had grabbed so far and go to the other side where the bottles are. I grab the 2 and open them and hand them over. Then ask if the cans are okay for others. Then he comes back with more but I had given them one can already that they accepted. So they had two bottles and 1 can. Then I start handing them more bottles. 6 at one time so the count is now at 9. So I confirm that I will grab 3 more. They say four. I turn around to make sure I didn't get that can I thought they did thinking maybe I took it away and forgot to not count it. But I saw the can in their hand. So I count them in front of the guy getting to 9 then counting to 12 with 3 fingers from there. But once again he said 4. But now I say ""four?"" As a question, thinking he wants to add one more on. 

Now as I'm still giving a confused look he says that he gave the other bartender a $100 tip for those beers on top of the cost of them so that should be able to get him another beer or two ""for free"" since he gave so much extra. I can confirm he did give that tip because he also did the same thing to me earlier. They are very generous so I do just give him the 4 extra and forget about the actual math. I feel as though he has earned it through his tips and most bartenders I know would probably do that too. But I can't help to wonder if it's right? I don't want to sound greedy because he really was being generous with the amount he was tipping so if we bought him a couple beers we would still be making way more than an average busy night. But it feels like he thinks that since we tips we'll that he gets free things presumably from the already tipped money. That feels like if you went to a coffee shop and put a big tip like $20 in the tip jar, but then after you got your order you asked them for an extra shot of espresso and they say it's $1 for a shot of espresso and then you take a dollar out of the tip jar and then say ""well I tipped you 20 earlier so now I tip 19"". 

Like sure, I guess you could do that, but imagine how that bartender or barista feels, they get all happy and excited about a really good tip but now they are asking for some of it back because they feels entitled for giving you a big tip. 

Anyways, I wouldn't do anything differently, they were never rude, but either their math skills aren't good or they really thought they were owed free drinks for being generous. But how do you feel? Would you do the same as me? Do you agree with them? Would you take it out of your tips or would you not ring it in at all? ",3,1746269338.0,bartenders,1,0.81,False

it looks like there won’t be any issues with the left groin bearing today. they tried greasing it yesterday, but they just replaced it for this dive, so you’ll be able to move your leg freely this time.



what a great tracksuit by the way, what a shame you\`ll be wearing it under the Hardsuit. although… wearing it over the hardsuit also seems a bit silly (giggle)



so, are you ready to get inside, ok, carefully <sounds of getting inside>   
  


I hope it's cozy in there. Do you have the plan memorized? Do you need me to remind you of anything?



 ok, so let me put the plexiglass dome on (sound of putting it on and sound of screwing three bolts, start muffled version of all sfx and speaker over intercom)



I\`ll give you some power, could you please test the thrusters a bit? (short thruster sounds x4, about a second in between). from what I see you’ve got maximal surface RPMs on all thrusters, you can stop now. 



I see you are breathing using the Hardsuit’s life support system, internal cabin pressure is negative 0,2 PSI, there is no CO2 inside. I can confirm that all systems are working properly. the Hardsuit is ready to dive. (muffled tapping, kiss, muffled crane, start of dive. splash, underwater sfx)



Scuba diver unhooked your Hardsuit, let’s complete the checklist. I can hear you loud and clear, comms are a-ok., I will switch to backup 27khz acoustic (higher radio interference for a while).  One, one, one. Ok, it works properly (switching back to main comms).. No leaks, confirmed. Could you  test the new groin bearing? just, move your left leg back and forth as much as you can. Does that work?



good. Oxygen supply works properly, you are currently using Tank 1. Cabin pressure is negative 0,35 PSI, as always I will control it, please expect nominal negative 1 PSI within 15-20 minutes. No  carbon dioxide inside, Diagnostics system shows no errors. It seems you are emerging a little bit, please fill water ballast a little bit, according to my data 8-10 pounds will work. Good. Are you ready to begin the descent? Perfect.



So, we’re down here to install two flanges. The needed Tensioners are already set,  your task is tightening screws and bolts. The Flanges are in sector D7, it\`s approximately 275 feet from our ship’s position, of course 50 degrees. it’s at 1100 feet depth. Current depth is 165 feet, descent is 0.8 feet per second, all parameters are fine. 

400 feet. 

750 feet… 



oh, look at that! What a colorful fish, uncommon in this part of the ocean. The lamps on the suit attract so many animals.. I\`d say you are an alien or a UFO for them. Or maybe UDO? you know, unidentified diving object?

Ok, you reached 1120 feet, let\`s cross check suit parameters. Good, good, I confirm. Your vital parameters are perfect. 

It seems that you passed thermocline, temperature outside is 37°F. I\`m really glad that you are inside this heavily armoured Hardsuit, down there in that abyss. Internal pressure is negative 1 PSI, please confirm. 



are you still comfortable in there? 



Good, let\`s head towards sector D7. Ok, please stop for a while, let me check… Fine, now I know where you are. (laugh) yes, I know this oil rig really well. Fly towards this tube structure, forward, forward… Now turn left… perfect. Those are two flanges to install. Now go around 20 feet lower.  der for your Hardsuits umbilical cord. Yes, I think 100 feet of reserve cord will be enough. You will be using the most powerful impact wrench, so I will put some more juice to your batteries… ok, 7 Amps are enough. You can start connecting the first flange. I don\`t want to disturb you… or maybe I will help you singing. 

 

Oh, well… I\`ll be just looking at your work then. 



(ocean sounds to indicate time passing)



Carbon dioxide level and oxygen consumption are rising, yes, yes.. it\`s under warning alarms level, I\`ll turn up the fan of the scrubbing system and let some fresh oxygen inside. 



Ok, there is no carbon dioxide left. What do you think, would leaving you for three minutes to make coffee be very unprofessional? 



(laugh) thanks. 



Oh, nice! you’re ending the first flanger. Ooo, sure, I will check impact wrench telemetry… yes, I confirm, all nuts are screwed with proper torque, 161-172Nm. Well, the second flanger is located 80 feet away, course -70 degrees. Please cross check parameters… 



yes… 



I know but you are operating on almost maximal operational depth. I confirm proper vital and suits parameters. Pressure of Tank 1 is 165 bars. Would you like to have a break? After the second flang? ok, ok.

  

Remember to unlock the suit’s umbilical cord from the holder. 



Weather on the surface? It\`s a beautiful sunset but it\`s getting windy. 



No, no, according to the weather forecast there is no risk of big waves, four on the Beaufort scale, so we will be able to recover you without using a LARS platform. I see you\`re doing a great job with the second flanger so far, I\`m always amazed how you guys are able to precisely fly in those Hardsuits. Yes, your main battery is 100% charged, don\`t worry, I took care of it. 



(ocean sounds to indicate time passing)



Ok, let me check, all nuts are screwed with proper torque, 156-168Nm… oh, except screw number 17, it seems loose, please check it. 



Yes, now it\`s fine, 167Nm. Time for a break, you can lean your Hardsuit against this bracket, I\`m turning off all four thrusters.



 It\`s so quiet now… It must be awesome, being so deep underwater in total darkness, I guess you feel like an astronaut. 



(laugh) no, no way, I won\`t dive. Well, actually yes, I\`ve tried to take a Hardsuit for a spin in our test pool in Vancouver last year. It wasn\`t fun at all, I\`m claustrophobic. 



Hmm, around 20-25 minutes? But there was one positive, for sure I had the most badass profile pic on tinder, haha. 



Yes, Emily is already back on deck, she exceeded 1000ft depth in her Hardsuit for the first time. 



Sure, I\`ll convey congratulations. Ok, so you are ready to continue your tasks? Thrusters on, please cross-check vital and suit parameters. 



Oh, sure, you have been underwater for some time already, I will increase cabin pressure from -1Psi to -0,75Psi and hold it. Your second task is to insert shuttle valves and to insert hot stabs inside in sector C8. Yes, in a backup redundant oxygen pipe. Ok, turn around and reduce depth to 900ft and go towards, course -35 for 460-480 feets. Pressure in Tank 1 is 130 bars. 



Ok, I\`ll turn up fan of the scrubbing system to the maximum for some time. Valves are located on your left.



 let me check… go 10-15 feet up… perfect. Please cross - check parameters.



yes, I confirm. Are you ready to start inserting the valve? 



Good, I\`ll just watch and learn haha. 



And the first one is almost ready, it\`s unbelievable how easy it looks when such an experienced diver is performing those tasks. 



Watch out, I have an alert, strong bottom current, please confirm. 



Oh, so you are able to counteract it using thrusters? Ok, but be careful. I see the second valve is ready. 



Perfect, according to the project redundant oxygen system is completed. How do you feel, are you tired? You did so well today. 



Yes, we need photo documentation for the investor, but don\`t worry, I\`ll assign a ROV, it's a complex installation, flying in might be dangerous for a Hardsuit, even with such a brave and experienced pilot as you. And now you are exposed to those bottom currents… 



Yes, it's time to surface. I'll check it. 



Yes, I confirm no obstacles above you. Please set course -65, emergence speed 1,2 feet per second, and velocity 2 knots. According to my calculations you\`ll bob up just next to the ship. 



(laugh) Yes, I\`m really good at math. Current depth is 720 feet. What a shame that it's late evening already. I love the view during ascent, when it's getting brighter and brighter around, it's like leaving space and coming back to Earth. 490 feet, scuba diver is already in water, rendezvous at 30 feets. 170 feets… 120 feet, 70 feet… oh I see the lights from your Hardsuit now! 30 feet, please wait until the scuba diver confirms proper hooking of your suit. 



Ok, I\`m turning off the thrusters, we\`re recovering you by crane. (sounds of muffled hits and grabbing, dome kiss). 



I\`m turning off the power supply pump, scrubbing system and the electricity.(sounding of touching plexiglass dome and unbolting three screws). 



Hi, welcome back. You did great today. Let me unlock the trigs, please remove your hands from manipulators, the upper part of the Hardsuit is lifting, and you\`re out!



congratulations! you did it!

(Mini vent),"Sometimes I wake up after staying up late, after sleeping in, or before a day I particularly don't look forward to, I have this mental barrier for eating. I'm physically hungry, but the idea of putting anything in my mouth becomes extremely unappetising. Not even anything sweet or something I generally love.

Like, I'm done with having to eat every day. Feels like I'm constantly consuming something and I'm getting tired of having to eat (I'm not even underweight, I'm the most average size.).

And I feel this melancholy and disinterest in anything, and I feel so exhausted—I would go back to sleep if I could do it gult-free. 
It's not even stress related, I think? Happens on most random days, like today, which is actually a school break.

So all I can stomach on such days is water, tea and any other zero calorie zero coffee drink. And it reminds me of when I would starve myself deliberately, but I don't do that anymore, I eat normally now, most days. 
But I really hate this feeling and I was wondering what's causing this and how can I prevent it from happening in the future. Any ideas?",1,1746269008.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1kdq165,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1kdq165/uncover_the_samsung_qn55q80b_4k_smart_tv_review/,Uncover the SAMSUNG QN55Q80B 4K Smart TV review Is It Worth Buying?,"The SAMSUNG QN55Q80BAFXZA 55-Inch Class Q80B Series QLED 4K Smart TV has been a part of my home media setup for a few weeks. I got the chance to test its features against the claims made in its product description, the glowing reviews online, and even some skepticism I had given its price tag. As someone who spends way too many hours binge-watching everything from sci-fi to sports, and occasionally dabbling in console gaming, this TV has gotten more use in a short amount of time than it might get in the average household. Here’s my take on it.

**Picture quality and color performance**  
From the moment I powered it up, it was clear this isn’t your run-of-the-mill 4K television. The Direct Full Array backlighting creates incredible contrast, showing deep blacks and pure whites that I didn’t even realize some of my older favorite shows were capable of. Watching a nature documentary with vibrant rainforest greens and rich sunsets practically felt like looking through a window at real life. Quantum HDR 12x is a real game changer here, offering a broader range of colors and depth that made me actually appreciate some cinematography more than before. The 100% Color Volume technology ensures that colors stay accurate no matter the brightness level, which is great because my living room brings in a ton of natural light during the day.

**Immersive sound experience**  
I didn’t think I used to care much about TV audio quality, but the Dolby Atmos and Object Tracking Sound in this QLED TV sold me on its importance. With the 2.2.2 channel speaker setup, I genuinely felt sound following the action during an action movie scene where cars raced left and right. The surround-like experience without any external sound systems surprised me. My brother joked that it doesn’t just feel like a TV but more like we were sitting in a mini-cinema; that said, it does feel like external speakers could take it even further.  

[Don’t miss SAMSUNG QN55Q80BAFXZA deals—check Amazon here.](https://raltv.com/p/b09vct2qbb/)  

**Gaming and motion clarity**  
As a gamer, the Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ feature stood out to me. Any game that requires split-second reactions – think fast-paced combat games, racing simulators, or sports titles – was handled effortlessly by the 120Hz refresh rate. There’s minimal motion blur, even in high-action scenes. It pairs seamlessly with my console, and the jazzed-up visuals thanks to 4K upscaling provided by the Quantum Processor made games I’ve played before feel fresh and new. There is a Game Mode buried in the settings that optimizes input lag and performance. However, the settings menu doesn’t make explanations very intuitive, so figuring it out felt like solving a tech puzzle.  

**Voice assistant integration and Smart TV features**  
The built-in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Bixby give it a smart home edge that immediately simplified some daily tasks for me. I’m someone constantly juggling coffee mugs and laundry baskets, so having voice commands to launch an app or search for content still feels slightly futuristic. Navigating streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube is smooth; there was no lag in switching between apps or scrolling through menus. I appreciated that the remote integrates these assistants. The only “meh” part is that syncing custom smart home routines (e.g., dimming lights with Netflix) doesn’t work flawlessly every time when there are too many assistant platforms at play.

**Positives**
- Stunning Direct Full Array with deep blacks and vivid whites.
- Quantum HDR 12x for extended color range and depth.
- Motion clarity for gamers thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate.
- Impressive cinematic sound with Object Tracking Sound and Dolby Atmos.
- Smart TV capabilities with a choice between Alexa, Google Assistant, or Bixby.  

**Downsides**  
- Complicated settings navigation for advanced features like Game Mode.  
- Standard speakers still can’t rival a dedicated soundbar or speakers.
- External setup for smart home integrations had occasional glitches.

**Other Options**  
Comparing this QLED TV to peers like LG OLED TVs, the picture contrast levels are comparable, but OLED panels might provide slightly better black levels. However, Samsung’s QLED TVs tend to be more reliable in brightness performance, making them ideal for medium-to-bright rooms. As for Sony’s entry-level 4K TVs at similar sizes, they offer great picture quality but often lack the deep feature integration (like Voice Assistants and motion enhancements) that you get with this model. If your focus is gaming, Sony’s latency settings are also strong competitors, though I found the Samsung model to feel more fluid.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Taking everything into consideration, I’d say this TV is punching well above its weight for features vs. price. Incorporating futuristic tech like Quantum HDR and 4K upscaling with such razor-sharp image quality didn’t leave me feeling like I needed to make technical sacrifices. Slightly pricier models like top-tier OLEDs might offer incremental improvements in dark room use cases while this one edges out most mid-range TVs on its versatility in gaming, audio, and brightness.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The eternal derby match between Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe - where the only thing more intense than the rivalry is the Turkish coffee being consumed by the fans.

Beşiktaş, currently 4th in the Süper Lig with 52 points, is looking to win the derby and finish 3rd in the league. However, they'll be without several key players due to injury and suspension, which could be a significant blow to their chances. Fenerbahçe, on the other hand, is 2nd in the league with 75 points and will be looking to maintain their position.

Historically, Fenerbahçe has a slight edge in terms of wins and goals scored, but Beşiktaş has won 4 out of the last 10 matches against their eternal rival. The two teams have met 4 times in the 34th week of the Trendyol Süper Lig, with Beşiktaş winning 4 times, Fenerbahçe winning 2 times, and 4 times ending in a draw.

The odds are heavily in favor of Fenerbahçe, with prices ranging from 1.50 to 1.54 across different bookmakers. Beşiktaş is priced between 4.95 and 5.40, while the draw is priced between 4.30 and 4.60.

My best bet for this match is Fenerbahçe to win, priced at 1.51 on FanDuel. Given their strong league position and Beşiktaş's injury woes, I think Fenerbahçe has a significant advantage in this match. Additionally, the over 2.5 goals market, priced at 1.82 on LowVig.ag, is also an attractive option, considering the historical goal-scoring records between these two teams.

So, if you're looking to place a bet on this intense derby match, I'd recommend backing Fenerbahçe to win or the over 2.5 goals market. Just remember, in the world of Turkish football, anything can happen, and the coffee is always strong.

They never held hands in daylight,
only in the hush between shadows—
where the world turned its head,
and love could breathe, if only briefly.

Their laughter lived behind closed doors,
their stories told in glances,
in the way one would wait
just a few steps behind,
so no one would ask.

They spoke in coded warmth,
in shared coffees and borrowed scarves,
in the way one always knew
when the other was falling apart.

The world called them friends—
brushed away the softness,
ignored the depth.

But in stolen moments,
in eyes that said “I see you,”
they built a love
so quiet,
it roared.

2023
Kurono chronograph II: My first watch, took my time choosing the watch, then finding a good listing (price/condition). It was the biggest purchase I'd ever made at that point, so was nervous to pull the trigger. Eventually purchased to celebrate getting into a competitive uni degree.

Seiko Iori Moments: Saw this after few times on Instagram and loved the dial. Around a year after purchase, I sold this due to lack of wear. I sometimes still think about the dial on this watch.

2024
Seiko Irish Coffee: Decided on this around 3 months after the Iori Moments, purchased about a monthlater. Like the Iori Moments, I was drawn to the dial design. However, this one ended up taking up much more wrist time. I found that I preferred watches with a complication(s).

(Purchased 2024, arrived 2025)
(Tag) Heuer Carrera Re-edition: First saw this on WatchStudies on Instagram and loved it. At first I was adamantly against actually buying it because I didn't like the idea of being influenced by social media. But, like with every other watch I've bought, it kept coming back to mind. I later debated between this and the new reverse pandas glass box carerra but the classic Heuer logo, white rings (daytona rings?) with black subdials instead of the full white subdials, and not having a date at 12 made me choose this.

2025
Seiko Alpinist GMT: I wavered between this, the green alpinist (no GMT) and the baby alpinist. Got the chance to try the latter two and a black gmt. The cyclops on the regular alpinist really didn't do it for me, I wanted to love the baby alpinist but it didn't look quite right on my wrist. I was quite happy with the black gmt, but preferred the iconic green colorway so held off on the purchase. At this point my family had caught on to my watch hobby (obsession?) and offered to gift me a green alpinidt gmt for my birthday. 


I've been saving up for a Breitling chronomat gmt and am on track to have enough in June. Its design aspects (rouleaux bracelet, onion crown) really speak to me. But recently, with the new Top Time B31, I've been hesitating. I don't think anything else can scratch the itch of the chronomat since its design is so unique. But the B31 movement is notably superior. I also heard somewhere-not sure if it was an interview or just people hypothesizing-that Breitling might add complications to the B31 movement so in time there might be a chronomat gmts with the b31?
