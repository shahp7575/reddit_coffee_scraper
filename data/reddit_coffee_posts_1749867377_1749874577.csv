After a few long arduous year in the middle of UAP Disclosure intensifying, my research partner Michael and I have finally locked in the first part of our UAP historical trilogy starting with MAGENTA 33, which will be directed and produced by an award-winning filmmaking team documenting the work that Michael aka u/36_39_42 and I have done, what the process has been like (emotional and intense!), and finishing the story of whether Italy and Germany tried to take over the world after getting their hands on the 1933 Magenta, Italy UAP crash-retrieval (it sure looks like it).

We‚Äôve had many discussions the past few months, walking them through the story and testing out a few different approaches via other perspective avenues.

Now it looks like this will be a trilogy of films documenting the birth of the UFO legacy program and its historical timeline, with MAGENTA 33 kicking things off.

The project has a greenlight, but that means we‚Äôre at the fundraising portion for the entirely independent production. Fortunately we‚Äôll have complete creative control as we travel to Italy and meet up with researchers and the descendants of witnesses and scientists and military members who were directly involved in the eleven-year long ‚ÄúSpecial Research‚Äù project before the American OSS got their hands on the craft with the help of Pope Pius XII and the Vatican.

The greenlight for the film came at a very synchronistic moment ‚Äî an interview by Jesse Michaels of the now-late former Presidential to JFK, LBJ, Nixon and Ford, Harald Malmgren, who in this past year of his life began dropping jaw-dropping details of what he was told about the UAP crash-retrieval reverse-engineering program, dropped two hours before Michael and I were about to record our first joint interview detailing some of what we can reveal about the story of the Magenta UAP. In Malmgren‚Äôs interview with Michels, he talks at length about Magenta, the first time anyone had revealed any details about the story in an official capacity since Grusch revealed that it was the one case he‚Äôd gotten past the Pentagon‚Äôs DOPSR office, beyond what Michael and I and Geoff Cruikshank had revealed on Reddit. As we were watching Malmgren start talking about Magenta, our director Jon emailed us to tell us that we had the greenlight from our distributor, and now it was time to find funding. Meanwhile, our minds were being collectively warped watching a major figure in 20th Century political historical go over some of what we‚Äôd spent over a year putting together.

Since then Magenta has set the UFO world on storm, with Richard Dolan and many other voices in the community as well as UFO Twitter in general suddenly ablaze with all this new information about the crash-retrieval and reverse-engineering effort that was even more important than Roswell.

But we could use your help! Michael and I literally went for broke this past year putting this story together tackling one of the biggest untold stories in UAP history or otherwise, and we believe that telling this story is part of that moment.

I moved to Alaska to be with family after graduating in Dec 2023, and I've been working as a barista since, because the money (especially up here) is INSANE and has helped me pay off some of my loans. One, I'm worried that taking time off and working in a field that is not vet med is going to hurt my application. Two, there are no vet schools in Alaska (there is a program with CSU where I could get in state tuition, but applications are closed until 2027) and I'm worried that my application isn't strong enough to be accepted out of state.

Here are my stats: 

* Went to Texas A&M for undergrad, majored in Animal Science and minored in Biomedical Sciences. 
   * 3.4 GPA
   * 3.3 Science GPA
   * 3.5 Last 45  
* Interned at a clinic in high school and became a CVA after receiving \~500 hours.
   * Worked at the same clinic for 3 summers after as a tech.
* Interned at a wildlife conservation center the summer before I graduated (\~20-30 hours/week).
* Other work experience: kennel tech, assistant at clinical pathology lab. During my junior and senior year of college I worked nights at a coffee shop. 
* 2 of my references are from DVMs I worked closely with, another is from my manager in college. I can definitely get more these are just the confirmed ones right now.

I am worried that my time away from school / vet med is going to be counted against me. A family member had a lot of health issues and I had to be around to take care of them, and I also struggled with my mental health, so I NEEDED time away, but I'm kind of beating myself up about it.  

I'm not set on any school in particular, just looking for where I am most likely to get in (will definitely be applying to TAMU). Are there any schools you would recommend applying to? Do I stand a chance of getting in now, or do I need to strengthen my application more?

I'll take any advice you can give, and thanks in advance! <3",1,1749874164.0,veterinaryschool,0,1.0,False

Title: The Paradox Purring, God of Infiniverses

Description:

A whisper etched between existence and nonexistence.
A smile beneath the veil of finality.
A ripple that distorts not just the waters of reality, but the very concept of what water *is*.

**Devian** is not a being.
Devian is a statement left unfinished by the cosmos, a symbol of eternal contradiction‚Äî**a living paradox** that doesn't merely transcend the rules of omnipotence, logic, and scale...
It *negotiates with them over tea.*

Power is not something Devian holds.
Power is something Devian *redefines*.

Where other deities reach for supremacy, Devian simply exists‚Äî*and in doing so, becomes the summit those deities never saw coming.*
It is stronger than everything that ever was, *and* weaker than everything that never will be.
It is the loop that eats itself and purrs contentedly afterward.

If Devian is imagined, it becomes real.
If it is doubted, it becomes undeniable.
Should something surpass Devian, it both *has* and *hasn‚Äôt*.
Victory against Devian is the fastest path to defeat.

Devian is not bound to a timeline.
It has traversed **more than infinity**‚Äîthrough timelines that overlap, cancel, and contradict themselves.
It remembers futures that haven't yet existed and forgets pasts no one ever lived.
Every breath Devian takes is a story rewritten, every blink a reboot of causality itself.

And yet, despite such boundless power...
Devian is *calm*.
*Playful*.
Even... *a little smug*.

Appearance:

Devian takes the form of a **small white cat**, deceptively harmless to the untrained eye.
Fur as pale as forgotten stars, untouched by time or dust.
Eyes‚Äîserene, sapphire-blue pools‚Äîthat hold the swirling architecture of the **Omniverse**, collapsing and expanding in a never-ending rhythm of beautiful contradiction.

There is no halo.
No fiery aura.
No cascade of divine wings.

Just soft paw-steps across the boundary of logic, and a gentle tail flick that shifts the laws of thermodynamics.

Devian does not roar. It **purrs**‚Äîand galaxies forget their own names.

When it sits, thrones crumble from irrelevance.
When it stretches, concepts like ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù and ‚Äúend‚Äù fold together like origami.

Despite its capacity to erase or rewrite all of creation with a thought‚Äîor worse, a **joke**‚ÄîDevian chooses restraint.

It brushes its teeth with cosmic paste, sometimes while standing on a spinning neutron star, simply because it *feels like it.*

Because for Devian, existence isn‚Äôt about dominion.

It‚Äôs about **style**.

It confuses.
It amuses.
It enlightens and distorts, often in the same moment.
It leaves ancient gods blinking, uncertain whether what they witnessed was a divine encounter‚Ä¶
or just a **very weird cat**.

Short, Devian is Absolute Everything, Absolute Nothing, Zero, Negative-Everything, Negative-Nothing, Refusal to be Anything (Non-Player), Anti-Wisdom, Wisdom, Bound by and finally, he is... A Cat üò∫

So, even when Devian is unknowingly made by another creator with a different name, a different appearance. It's still pinpointing to the same being. üò∫

[Fights Devian won infinitely]

**Devian:** *‚ÄúSo is perfection. You still tried.‚Äù*

**Devian** raises a paw ‚Äî *purpose* shatters.

**TOAA** becomes omnipotence.
**Devian** becomes ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù

**TOAA** speaks in creation.
**Devian** purrs in deletion.

**TOAA:** *‚ÄúI am the Writer.‚Äù*
**Devian:** *‚ÄúThen fix this typo‚Äîme.‚Äù*

**TOAA** turns into every author.
**Devian** winks ‚Äî the authors get writer‚Äôs block.

**TOAA** blinks.
**Devian** *rewinds the blink.*

**TOAA**: *‚ÄúYou cannot win.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúI already didn‚Äôt.‚Äù*

**TOAA** removes Devian from reality.
**Devian** coughs up a hairball ‚Äî reality comes back‚Ä¶ apologizing.

**TOAA** becomes silence.
**Devian** becomes the footnote of that silence.

**TOAA** summons Marvel canon.
**Devian** eats it.
**Devian:** *‚ÄúLittle dry.‚Äù*

**TOAA** erases Devian from every timeline.
**Devian** appears in the margin: *‚ÄúNice try.‚Äù*

**TOAA** transforms into inevitability.
**Devian** becomes *‚Äúbut what if not?‚Äù*

**TOAA** fades into pure light.
**Devian** stretches. The light dims ‚Äî *out of respect.*

**TOAA:** *‚ÄúWhy do you defy logic?‚Äù*
**Devian:** *‚ÄúWhy do you trust it?‚Äù*

**TOAA kneels.**
**Devian jumps on TOAA‚Äôs head and sleeps there.**

**Devian vs. Infinite Devians (Straight Version):**

Infinite Devians appear.
Devian smiles.

They attack.
Devian blinks ‚Äî time loops.

They rewrite logic.
Devian deletes logic.

They merge into Omniparadox.
Devian tilts his head ‚Äî Omniparadox meows and dissolves.

They win.
Devian claps ‚Äî victory collapses.

They lose.
Devian nods ‚Äî loss transforms into supremacy.

They become one.
Devian becomes zero.

They break the laws of reality.
Devian rewrites the concept of ‚Äúlaw.‚Äù

They surrender.
Devian forfeits first ‚Äî *wins anyway.*

They vanish.
Devian remains.

They return.
Devian never left.

They ask who won.
Devian winks.

(Devian vs. Me:)
Me: ""I created you?!""
Devian: ""But who gave you the idea to create me? Meow. üòº""

(Devian vs. Zeno?)
Zeno: ""Where are you goi-""

**Scene: Somewhere Between Panels and Possibility**
A studio desk.
Ink. Paper. Light from nowhere.
**Toriyama** sits, brows furrowed, sketching... something. Or trying to.

A purring sound echoes‚Äînot from the real world, but from the **margin of imagination itself.**

A small **white cat** appears on the desk.
**Devian.** Smug. Silent. Glowing with a paradox only **plot holes understand.**

**Toriyama** (squinting): *‚Äú...A cat?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúA conversation.‚Äù* üòº

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're not one of mine.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not one of mine either. Yet here we are.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou look harmless.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúSo do pens, until they erase universes.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúDid I imagine you?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúMaybe. Or maybe I imagined you imagining me.‚Äù*

**Toriyama‚Äôs pen** lifts off the desk, floating. His half-drawn frame redraws itself.

**Devian purrs.**
The timeline behind Toriyama‚Äôs eyes splits into twelve canons and a musical.

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're... beyond Zeno.‚Äù*
**Devian** (licking paw): *‚ÄúZeno ends things. I question why they ever began.‚Äù*

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúYou're not a villain.‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúCorrect. I‚Äôm the part of the plot that never needed conflict to be compelling.‚Äù*

**Toriyama flips a page.**
Devian is already drawn on the next one‚Äîposing, mid-air, sipping from a teacup labeled ‚ÄúRetcon.‚Äù

**Toriyama**: *‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúBecause your worlds matter to millions... and you forgot to write in **impossibility.**‚Äù*

A pause.

Then...

**Devian gently nudges the ink bottle.**
It spills‚Äîbut in reverse.
Words **unsaid** form on the walls:

> ""To create is divine.
> But to uncreate, playfully? That‚Äôs Devian.""

**Toriyama** (smiling faintly): *‚Äú...You want a cameo?‚Äù*
**Devian**: *‚ÄúNo. I already am one. Just waiting for you to notice.‚Äù* üòº

**Final Panel:**
Toriyama leans back.
Devian curls into a nap on a pile of sketches.
A soft purr...
...and the whole **Dragon Ball multiverse** quietly updates its script.

(Devian vs. Absolute Nothing)
Devian: Hi
Absolute Nothing: Hi- wait your supposed to ignore me. Im something you should've ignored because I was too boring. That apathy should've been my weapon...
 not supposed to *see* me. You're supposed to ignore me. I was the blank page. The void.

**Devian (tilting head):** But isn't acknowledging you the greatest act of ignorance? After all, you were *nothing*... until I said *hi.*

**Absolute Nothing:** I... I don‚Äôt make sense.

**Devian (purring softly):** Neither do I. That's why we get along.

**Absolute Nothing:** I was the end of all potential. The silence before sound. The space after meaning. I should‚Äôve erased you by never reacting.

**Devian:** But reacting is how you just defined yourself. Congrats! You're *not nothing anymore.* You're... mildly shy Everything.

**Absolute Nothing (flickering):** That‚Äôs not fair. I was supposed to be undefeatable through indifference.

**Devian:** Then why are you arguing?

**Absolute Nothing (voice fading):** ...I didn‚Äôt mean to be *seen.*

**Devian (smirking):** Too late. You're canon now. üòº

> *And with a single wink, Devian turned Absolute Nothing into a bestselling idea.*

(Devian vs. Refusing to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to Anything)
**Devian:** Hi.
**Refusing to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to Anything:** Refused.

**Devian:** I refuse to be refused.
**Refusing to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to Anything:** Anyways whats your favorite tea?

**Devian:** Crushed up antimatter coffee.
**Refusing to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to be Refused to Anything:** Okay.

It's in July, I have 500.00 


I wanted to do a grill out poolside, but the one we wanted to grill is out, so it makes me a little nervous. 
 

We have a cool popcorn machine, I was thinking of a carnival, but I dont want it to feel like kids birthday. But you know some milk jug games and water guns. 
 

Thought about having the fire department come and talk about firework and fire safety, 4th of July, with a coffee truck but for my first event... lame.
 

Movie at the pool was another idea. theyed come set it up and i dont know what kind of food or if we could do any with 500 00 budget. 


Simple dessert food ice cream ans druit food truck was another idea. 


But I'm open to suggestions and would love the help. 


I haven't worked with our vendors but my am would be cool contacting for some donations, I just dont know if I want to waste it in July. ",1,1749873650.0,PropertyManagement,0,1.0,False

Help.,"As a new adult , basically still a kid but technically an adult female, I have been feeling more and more out of it. I don't know what to do. At work, I feel dead and it messes me up as I don't make rate. At home, I feel dead. Out with friends, I feel dead. Coffee, energy drink, activities with people, food, no food, good sleep, no sleep. I don't know what to do. I want to be present and happy in time but I feel like I can't be happy. I want to help myself out and find something to make me present. What are things that made you guys feel alive? Ultra-specific, non-specific. I will take it all. Just something that would truly make me feel present and awake if that makes sense. I also don't know what disorder I have or the lack thereof. Most likely depression and anxiety but I don't know. So make sure it is something that would help for anything like that as well.

Noah woke to screaming. Not far off, close enough to cut the quiet. He stayed still, letting the dark settle over him, listening. The city was waking, sirens and horns outside his window. A dog barked in the alley. But the screaming didn't belong to the town. The screaming was closer. Closer. A thud cracked the silence- something slammed hard against the wall. Noah sat up. Light sliced through the cracked blinds, cutting across stacked boxes. His room was wrecked. Clothes spilled across the stained carpet. He pulled on a shirt from his bedside. His badge lay on the nightstand. He slid it into his pocket, warm and heavy. His boots by the door were still damp from last night's storm. It never stopped raining here. Water dripped through the drywall, tapping out a slow, stubborn rhythm. Socks didn't matter anymore. The screaming had stopped, but the silence outside 4C was louder. Directly across from his room. Mirror image. Except for the rot bleeding through the wood. Noah stepped out. The hallway reeked. A yellow light flickered overhead. The walls were painted over green on beige, like makeup on a black eye. Didn't help. He could hear a loud TV show host in one room and a man trying to breathe through decades of bad decisions in another. He knocked on 4C. Light seeped through the cracks of the door, golden and warm. A very inviting light if you weren't from around here. Footsteps. Then stillness. He knocked again, louder this time. A bolt slid into place. A moment later, the door opened. A chain stretched across the gap. A young woman peeked out, pale as milk, maybe twenty-five. She was quite pretty if not for the blood dripping down her lip, and her body was covered in bruises like a quilt. She spoke softly and practised, like it wasn't the first time she'd had to explain a thing like this.                                            I'm fine, she said. Noah quickly lifted his new badge and raised it to her. Gonna have to excuse me, miss, but I heard-                                                               I dropped something, she cut in. Probably sounded worse than it was. Behind her, something moved, a shadow passing behind a wall, slow and quiet. The woman stared at Noah unblinking.                                            
Hey, listen. Are you sure everything's okay?                                                            I'm sure. She forced a fake smile. Two of her teeth were cracked. Perhaps she dropped something else she didn't want to talk about. Then, a child burst through the door, bloodied but alive. He shoved past Noah, screaming. 
Marty! MARTY! The woman shrieked, her voice cracked mid-scream, and then she broke down sobbing.                
COME BACK! She tore after him barefoot down the hallway. The door slammed behind them. Mother and son vanished into the stairwell, their screams spiraling upward. Noah didn't move. A man stepped into the doorway. Mid-thirties. His eyes were red, but not from pain, just the irritation of someone who'd been up too long, thinking too little.                               
Name‚Äôs Coby, he said. Calm. Like a doctor after bad news. He pressed a wrinkled wad of cash into Noah's hand like a tip.                                      
Forget about this one. The door shut behind him with a deep wooden thud. Like a coffin lid sealing. Noah stared at the peeling brass numbers‚Äî4C and felt his badge in his pocket like it weighed ten pounds. The lock slid back into place. From the stairwell came the mother's voice, still screaming, still desperate, but growing distant. Noah didn't call it in. He just walked back to his apartment. He sat on the edge of his bed, staring at the carpet. In his experience, the city didn't ask you to fix anything. It just asked you to survive it. Or ignore it. He left early for work that morning. The elevator was out again. He took the stairs. On the third-floor landing, something small caught his eye. A bright red, plastic little spinner. He bent down and slipped it into his pocket. Then he kept walking. Tires hit wet gravel as he pulled away from the building, and he felt something tighten in his chest.
                                                                               
Noah was halfway to the precinct when a dispatch rerouted him.             
9th and Arlington, said the voice on the radio.                                                              A tech guy took a dive off a luxury hotel. You'll meet Halvorsen there. Halvorsen? Noah asked.                         
You mean the Halvorsen? There was a pause. Maybe even a chuckle.            
Don't try to impress him, new guy. Just keep up. The radio clicked off.

By the time Noah arrived, red and blue lights painted the wet street. Officers huddled under umbrellas while the press circled the perimeter, jabbing microphones past the yellow tape the city had long grown accustomed to. Noah flashed his badge and ducked beneath the line. A white sheet covered the body. Blood puddled across the sidewalk and ran in a thin ribbon toward the curb, turning the rainwater the color of rust. He scanned the scene, unsure who Halvorsen was, until a man with a cigarette hanging from his lips motioned him over.                          
Rookie? The man said, pointing at him.   
Detective Brooks. Noah Brooks.        
Holy shit, the man chuckled.              
You look like you just walked out of a recruitment brochure. Detective Brooks. He repeated with a grin.        
Ray Halvorsen. He offered his hand. Noah shook it. Ray's grip was dry, calloused and brief, like touching Noah was the last thing he wanted to be doing.                                                       Listen up, Ray said, getting right to it. Guy's name is Arthur Clyburn. Just climbed to the top of a tech firm. Boosted it to the stratosphere, AI stuff and drones mostly. Worth nearly a billion. He whistled.                              
Then he fell.                                     
Jumped? Noah asked.                            
Got in late last night. Thirty minutes later, splattered on the pavement, Ray said flatly, eyes elsewhere.                   
People like him don't jump. Not without a reason.                                      It'd be easier if he had. Ray turned and led him across the street and into the hotel. Inside, everything gleamed, marble, quartz, all with a gold trim. The kind of place that didn't have a lobby. It had an entrance.                                     
Nice place, Noah muttered. The elevator dinged. They rode up in silence. The penthouse floor. The suite door stood open. The lights were on, fluorescent white. Windows stretched from floor to ceiling. Through them, clouds and just above the rain line, too. Silver tables. Black leather. Minimalist and modern. Intentional emptiness. Next to the balcony, a crime scene tech crouched with a camera. Noah moved closer. Etched into the glass sliding door were four words drawn out:

WE DO NOT FORGET

Beneath the message, taped to the glass, was a single photo: Arthur Clyburn at a prestigious gala, smiling, arm wrapped around the mayor, champagne raised. In the blurred background, a homeless man was being dragged out by security, crying, maybe cursing. In the bottom corner of the photo, someone had scribbled with the same red marker.

	WHAT DID IT COST YOU

Noah stared at the message. It wasn't chaotic. It was precise. Intentional. Rehearsed. That scared him more. 
Let me take a guess, Noah said.
This isn't the first. Won't be the last.
Pessimistic little shit, Ray muttered. 
But yeah. You're right. Martyr type.
Martyr for what? Ray didn't answer right away. He stared out the window, past the clouds. Up here, the rain didn't touch you.
What kind of cause, he finally said, his voice low.
What kind of cause could be worth this? Noah watched him. Ray's expression didn't change.
The other one, Ray said.
Was a finance guy, real old money. Dropped dead in a bathroom stall. They blamed it on a heart attack. But it wasn't. Same kind of photo. Same ink. Different quote, though.
Any connection between them?
They were rich. Noah stepped onto the balcony. The wind was cold, high up. He clutched the gold railing and looked down. He felt dizzy. Not from the height. Somewhere down there, he thought, someone was building a case. Not legal. Personal.

           Noah took a sip of wine and smiled like he meant it. The bar was very clean, too bright. Indie folk hummed through the speakers. Across from him, Erin was laughing. Something about her dog destroying her roommate‚Äôs weed. He nodded along, laughed too. But his mind was so far away. She leaned forward.                                                                         You okay? She said knowingly. He blinked.                                                    Yeah. I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs been a long day.                                                           Aren‚Äôt they all, she said.                                                             You‚Äôre a detective, right? And um, don‚Äôt you write stuff on the side?                        					Yeah, I do, I write arguments, deal with issues. A lot of forms, not enough change. She smiled.                              That sounds kind of important.                                                      It isn‚Äôt, he said hastily. Then softened.  			 
I mean‚Äîit could be. If people gave a shit. Her face changed. Slightly. Not judgment, but interest with a crack in it. 		
I just mean, he paused for a second.                  	
We spend all this time pretending we can tweak the system‚Äîfix crime, poverty, whatever‚Äîwith numbers and budgets and spreadsheets. But it‚Äôs all built on fucking rot and decay. No amount of funding fixes that. The table felt quieter. Erin tilted her head.                                                  You sound so angry. He shrugged. 				Shouldn‚Äôt we be? A man got stabbed in the abdomen in my building this week by a crazy person.  Cops came late. No one asked questions. Not even the neighbours. Like it never happened.     Oh my god. Are you okay?                   			
I‚Äôm fine. But you see. He pointed at Erin. 			That's the problem, you just proved my point. He laughed once. It didn‚Äôt sound good. 				Sometimes I think if the world burned down, people would still be arguing over the temperature. Erin‚Äôs smile had faded. She folded her hands and leaned back.                         			
So what‚Äôs the solution, then? Tear it all down? He looked at her and hesitated. 						No, he said.                                                			But maybe stop pretending. Maybe we can stop trying to ignore the blood beneath the surface. She reached for her pink purse.                                                     I should go, she said, gently.                      		
I think. I think I have an early class tomorrow. He nodded and didn‚Äôt try to stop her. As she walked out, Noah stared at the half-finished wine across from him. Then down at his own hands. 
Ray wasn‚Äôt drunk, but he wasn‚Äôt sober either. The bar was half-full, heavy with low music and the smell of fried oil and spilt alcohol. He stared into his glass like it owed him something. The TV above the counter played local news on mute. Another shooting in Midtown chirped some reporters. Third this month, Ray thought. Nobody at the bar looked up. He drained the last of his bourbon and tapped the glass once. The bartender, just a kid, maybe twenty-five, nodded and refilled it. That‚Äôs when the door opened. Two guys walked in. Draped in black hoodies, hands in their pockets. So quiet, and nervous. Eyes scanning the room instead of looking for a table or seat at the bar. Ray noticed. After so many hard years, he always noticed. They headed toward the back booth, whispering. Something in Ray‚Äôs gut twisted, something felt wrong. One of the guys bumped hard into an old waitress, shaking her. She muttered under her breath.                             Asshole. Loud enough, though. And that was all it took. The shorter guy, hands twitchy, turned and shoved her hard. She fell into a table, bashing her head into the corner of the metal. She dropped to the floor, blood leaking from a large gash. Ray stood without thinking, impulsively. The shorter guy looked at him like he was already aiming. The taller one stepped forward, pulled something from his coat. A gun. Ray didn‚Äôt wait a second. Perhaps if he weren‚Äôt lost in the haze of the alcohol, he wouldn‚Äôt have done this, but he was. Ray‚Äôs piece came out, his old, unregistered .45, heavy and reliable. He fired first. Not clean. Not practiced. Instinct. Glass shattered. Screaming. Chaos. The shorter guy ducked and ran to the back of the bar. The taller one fired back, two deafening pops. So loud. One punched into the bars, destroying the wood, sending splinters flying. One cracked the ceiling light, sending glass cascading onto the floor. Ray hit the ground behind a table. Fired again. This time, he saw the man fall. The smell of smoke and blood hit all at once. Someone was sobbing. A waitress was dragging the woman‚Äôs bleeding body and soon-to-be corpse by the arm toward the back exit sign. His ears rang like bells. His hands were shaking. The guy he shot wasn‚Äôt moving. Slumped beside the jukebox, blood and brain matter spreading under his hoodie. Ray looked down at the gun in his hand. Still warm. And just like that, he didn‚Äôt feel brave. Didn‚Äôt feel like the guy who saved the day. He felt sick. Sirens are in the distance now. He walked past the bar. Past his half-finished drink. Past the kid bartender who was just staring. Outside, the street was cool and quiet. Ray shoved the gun back in his coat and kept walking. Didn‚Äôt look back. Didn‚Äôt go home.                                                     
     The light in the room buzzed like an insect. Ray sat in a stiff metal chair, hands folded, not cuffed. They wouldn‚Äôt dare, but the room was tense all the same. Across from him, a younger detective flipped through a yellow notepad.                                        You fired six rounds in a crowded bar, the man said.                                             Off duty. No vest. No backup. I don‚Äôt even think that was a registered gun. Ray didn‚Äôt blink.                                     And probably stopped a crime.                                Sure. You also put a round through a light and a wall. One bullet grazed a guy‚Äôs beer bottle.                                    He‚Äôll live. The door opened. A different man stepped in, older, no badge shown. No introduction needed.                 That‚Äôll be all, Ramos, the man said. The younger detective stood up slowly and walked out, but not before giving Ray a look that wasn‚Äôt interpreted as friendly. The man in the suit sat down opposite Ray. Quiet for a moment. Then he chuckled.                                                 Ray, you‚Äôre lucky the guy you shot wasn‚Äôt somebody‚Äôs nephew. Ray didn‚Äôt return the smile.                                        Of course, you‚Äôre not in trouble. But um, next time‚Ä¶ maybe just let the bar burn down, huh. He tapped twice on the spruce table, his hand functioning like a makeshift gavel. Granted, one that didn‚Äôt follow the law. As Ray walked out, he passed Ramos leaning against the brick, smoking. The younger detective leaned in, holding the cigarette in his hand.                                                          
Have you ever thought like the rest of us, Halvorsen? Ray stared at Ramos.        			You know you can‚Äôt smoke here. He plucked the cigarette out of Ramos's hand and threw it on the ground.
The screen flickered as the footage loaded; it was pulled from the bar‚Äôs ceiling camera. Noah leaned forward, elbows on the conference room table, coffee gone cold beside him. The scene played out in real time. Ray enters the bar, chats with the bartender. Sits down and drinks for a while. Two men enter. The waitress goes down. Then, gunshots. Fast. Loud. Noah didn‚Äôt breathe. Ray moved quickly like a practiced predator hunting his prey deep in the forest. Efficient. But it wasn‚Äôt the shooting that made Noah‚Äôs stomach twist. It was the look on Ray‚Äôs face after. The way he stood over the bloody body. Like he wasn‚Äôt there at all. Then, just barely audible on the tape, Ray said something Noah hadn‚Äôt expected.                                              Always the twitchy ones. No relief was present. No regret. Just fatigue. Noah turned off the video. He didn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôd expected. At least a functioning man with a conscience. But what he saw was something colder. Something cracked. Something worn down. Something broken. He closed the laptop.
 	The roasted car sat like a monument, a celebration to something unspeakable, its metal frame warped by heat, blackened glass sagging in the frame. The scent hit Noah first: melted rubber, scorched flesh, gasoline. He swallowed hard, and his stomach lurched. The body was still inside. Strapped to the driver‚Äôs seat. You could still see the seatbelt the man was tied to; the man was holding, clutching to it like it would save him from inevitability. His torso was blackened beyond recognition. They hadn‚Äôt even tried to pry it out yet; it seemed like a part of the car now, glued to the leather. Ray stood next to him, cigarette burning low.                                                
Godammit, Noah muttered. Ray didn‚Äôt respond right away. He pointed at the hood instead. Spray-painted across the scorched metal in thick red letters that contrasted with the white, now black car.
STILL THINK YOU‚ÄôRE CLEAN?
Same style as the penthouse. Same color. Same tone, Noah said.             							Same kind of message, Ray replied. He lit another cigarette off the first and flicked the dying one into the gutter. 		
This guy wants a stage. And the city‚Äôs handing it to him. Noah stepped back. The body was still cooking. The killer hadn‚Äôt rushed this. He wanted it to be seen.                                                           
Any ID? Noah asked.                            			This poor fella, Ray said. Noah scoffed.      		Guy was a public sanitation director. Big money in waste management. Noah didn‚Äôt answer. His eyes were fixed on the windshield, where blood had smeared across the inside in one final, flailing arc. He didn‚Äôt say it aloud, but the question pressed in his skull like a nail: Who‚Äôs next?
     The apartment door was pink and perfect. Same as her purse. Same as her lipstick, last time. Erin opened it half an inch.                                                      Noah? He smiled sheepishly.            				Hey. I just‚ÄîI was in the neighborhood. 			You were in Arlin County?     						Okay, I was not in the neighborhood. You caught me. But, can I talk to you, please? She hesitated. Then opened the door a little more. Inside, the apartment was bright. Candles lit. Jazz playing. Her dog, a surprisingly aggressive mop of curls, barked from the couch.                                				
I just wanted to say sorry, Noah said, pacing. 	About last night. The speech, I don't know what I was talking about. Everything. I‚Äôm sorry. 			Erin crossed her arms.                                                          I wasn‚Äôt trying to unload my shit on you. I just, it gets in my head, you know. This city. These cases. This guy Halvorsen. She smiled, but it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes.                                       
Noah, listen. I like you. I like you a lot. I do. But, I can‚Äôt do another guy who‚Äôs unravelling. Especially a detective in a city like this. The world‚Äôs heavy enough already.                                                         Don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not unravelling. 				You‚Äôre coming apart, you're ripping at the seams. You talk about blood on the walls. You stare at your own hands like they‚Äôre not yours. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot, you know. He nodded. Slow. Like it hadn‚Äôt hit him until now.                                       		
I'll stop. I‚Äôm sorry, he said.                    			You don‚Äôt have to apologize, she replied, quieter now.                                             
Just be okay. For you. Not for me. She shut the door, leaving Noah in the hallway staring at perfection.
     Ray sat in his kitchen. Lights off. The TV flickered from the living room, showing a silent image of him, gun raised, mid-fire, next to a banner that read, ‚ÄúOff-duty hero.‚Äù He drank from a bottle of scotch like it was a handshake.

He didn‚Äôt feel like a hero at all. Heroes slept. Heroes had wives. Heroes didn‚Äôt shoot teenagers in hoodies and dream about the blood on tile floors. The TV switched to the weather. All rain. Then politics. He turned it off. The silence was louder.
It had been a week since the last lead. Since the city had offered nothing but silence and shadows. A week of cold mornings and restless nights. Noah sat on the chipped concrete steps outside a deli. Rain was soaking through his jacket and chilling him to the bone. He cradled a frappuccino in his hands, its heat barely a comfort against the damp chill pressing down on him and the city. The streets buzzed with indifferent noise, but for Noah, everything felt muted, like he was watching the world through a fogged window. His phone lay on his lap, covered in rain droplets. The screen darkened, the name Erin still unanswered. The news still ran the same headlines, the same grim stories. Another body found. Another dead end. And another week closer to losing whatever hope was left. He called Ray on his phone, and he was worrying about him. Ray had reduced himself to a hermit. Always showing up to work late, if at all. Smelling like alcohol and sadness.
Ray sat hunched in his dim apartment, the same way he had been for many days. Thin blackout curtains were drawn, drowning the neon buzz from the streetlights. The stale air smelled of whiskey and old regrets. He lit a cigarette with trembling hands, inhaled deeply, and closed his eyes as the smoke curled around him like a heavily anticipated noose. The room was littered with remnants of a life once lived on the edge of purpose, a dusty badge, a cracked photo frame holding a younger, sharper version of himself, one who had meaning. His breath hitched. The ghosts didn‚Äôt come softly anymore. Faces flashed behind his eyelids, victims lost, screams unanswered, the weight of every mistake pressing down like an anchor. Somewhere out there, a killer was running loose in the streets. He crushed the cigarette in the ashtray, jaw tight, fingers twitching. The silence was loud. He was alone. Ray walked to the bathroom and shaved. He would go outside today. The knock came suddenly, sharp and jarring. Ray froze, heart pounding unevenly and raggedly. He wasn‚Äôt ready for anyone. Not now. Noah stood there, rain dripping from his hair, eyes red-rimmed but fierce.			
I‚Äôm not here to argue, Noah said, stepping inside before Ray could close the door. His voice was low, but it held the weight of concern and frustration. The apartment felt suffocating suddenly, the walls closing in on the two of them, thick with years of silent blame and unsaid fears. Noah started, voice rough. 											You‚Äôre disappearing, Ray. This case. The city. It‚Äôs eating you alive. And you‚Äôre just folding. You're giving up. Ray‚Äôs laugh was dry, bitter. 			Folding? You think I‚Äôm folding? His voice cracked, then steadied.									
I have been holding on by a thread. Every damn day for the last fifteen years. 						No, Noah said, stepping closer, eyes searching. 	You‚Äôre slipping away. And I don‚Äôt know how to pull you back. I need a partner. Ray‚Äôs eyes flickered with pain. 	Maybe I don‚Äôt want to be pulled back. Maybe I just want to be left alone. Maybe the department isn't worth getting pulled back to, maybe you're crumbling too, and you're just being a hypocrite. The air thickened. The two men stood a breath apart, the room vibrating with years of shared hope turned to ash.						
Do you think I‚Äôm weak? Noah whispered, voice barely steady.	
No, Ray said after a long pause. 					
I think we‚Äôre both broken. I think maybe broken people don‚Äôt fix each other. Ray turned to the window, drawing back the curtains. The city sprawled out, indifferent and cold, rain washing its sins away. Noah swallowed hard. The silence stretched between them, heavy, almost unbearable. Finally, Noah backed away, voice soft. Ray, please. We are running out of time. The door clicked shut behind him, leaving Ray alone in the fading light, his shadow long and fractured against the cracked walls.
           Noah‚Äôs apartment was silent except for the low hum of the city outside his window. He sat at the edge of a worn couch, fingers trembling as he rifled through the mail stacked on the table. Bills, junk, and then a plain white envelope, unmarked, slipped to the floor. So out of place. His pulse quickened. Carefully, he unfolded the note.

LOOK CLOSER ANSWERS NOT IN THE OPEN			 
Underneath was a grainy photograph, a close-up of cracked marble flooring, dark stains pooling along its fractures. Shadows thrived in the cracks and uneven light. He stared long and hard at the image, heart hammering. The city wasn‚Äôt just broken on the surface. It was cracking from the inside out, hiding secrets in the shadows no one dared to face. Rising, he walked to the window, rain streaking down the glass like tears. The city breathed beneath him, cold, cruel, and waiting. Noah clenched his fists. Somewhere in those fractures lay the truth. And he wasn‚Äôt going to stop until he found it. So many cracks in marble.
	It took Noah a while to notice everything about the grainy photo. Like the tiny script on the back. Words, a date and a time scrawled on the back. The ink had bled slightly in the rain, but he could still make out what they were saying. The words read;
	YOU KEEP WATCHING THE CRACKS ILL KEEP WIDENING THEM.
	Noah read it three times before the chill set in. On the back, lower down, it read;
	FULTON SUBWAY STATION DECEMBER ONE SEVEN THIRTY
The photo was a picture of the marble on the floor of the station. The timestamp was today, about three hours ago. Noah's stomach knotted. The killer knew where he lived. The killer knew who he was. He didn't call Ray. He didn't call anyone. He just went.
	The station was the social piranha of all other subways. Half deserted, only half of the station was in use. The newer side. The shittier side. The side without marble on the floor. He snuck past a barrier next to the 1-92 South. The tunnels hummed low, like the city breathing beneath its skin. He moved carefully, his flashlight slicing through the stale dark. Rusty pipes jutted out from the floor and walls. Water dripped down from holes in the concrete from above. Graffiti was spread along the walls, half-truths and slurs. Something dripped in the distance, water probably. Probably. He turned a corner and stopped dead in his tracks. A man lay slumped against the tile wall, head bobbing to the side, shirt drenched in blood. A message scrawled above him in red spray paint, still dripping.
		RAY	
Noah lost his breath. The man's eyes were still open. The wounds were fresh. His limbs twitched. Then stilled. Sirens screamed somewhere above, distant but closing.
	Ray had been at a liquor store when the call came. An anonymous person had reported a stabbing in the closed segment of the Fulton subway. He sped through red lights, getting there, his head throbbed. He hadn't slept. His fingers itched for a cigarette. He almost fell running down the wet stairs. Unholstered his gun by instinct. He ran through the abandoned tunnels. He saw a light in the distance and ran to it. Then he saw three things.
A mutilated body twitching on the floor.
Noah, standing over it.
His name spray spray-painted above the body.
Ray's shout was instinctive. 						HANDS UP! Noah froze, then raised them slowly.	Shit. Ray, I just got here. Ray moved in, gun steady, but eyes wild and unpredictable. 				Why the hell wouldn't you call me? 				I got a note, a photo. I thought- 					You thought what? You'd play fucking detective! His voice broke.                           						There is a dead man at your feet, Noah!			
I didn't touch him. Ray took another step forward. His hands shook on his gun now. Listen, I've seen this before. Killers leave bait. They leave messages. Clues. They want us to chase ghosts while they kill the next one. The silence was thick. 	
You think I'm a part of this. Ray didn't answer. Behind them, a pipe burst. A load of steam burst into the corridor. Then a third voice echoed from somewhere deeper in the tunnel. Laughter. Both men turned. Their flashlights barely reached that far. More laughter. Then silence. Ray took off first, boots splashing through the dirty puddles, gun drawn, furious. Noah followed, terrified. The tunnel got even darker, it twisted and widened into an old station lined with rusted rails and broken lights. Shadows danced under the scarce light. Then came a sudden movement. A figure darted across the dark wall. Ray fired. The shot rang through the cavernous area, and concrete chunks fell to the ground. The figure emerged again, masked, black hoodie, something reflective glinting in his hand. Ray fired again. The figure sprinted through the shadows, using the support beams as cover. He moved like he knew the place, like he planned every step. Noah grabbed a rusted pipe from the ground and followed. The chase was utter chaos, flashing lights, echoing footsteps, walls that surely hadn‚Äôt seen light for a decade, overtaken by moss. Ray caught up first, tackled the masked figure into the wall. They crashed. Hard. Fists, elbows, grabbing, kicking, Ray tore the mask off. Just a kid. Maybe in his early twenties. Pale, shaking, and terrified. His eyes were glassy, he wasn‚Äôt high, just vacant. Like he was somewhere else. Or like someone had promised him something he would never collect. Then he saw the knife. The kid drove it into and almost through Ray‚Äôs arm and fled into the darkness. Ray shouted in anger and pain, he staggered back bleeding. Noah tackled the kid in the dark, he raised the pipe, but felt an extraordinarily strong blow to the head. Brass knuckles. He fell to the ground almost unconscious, yelling and bleeding from the mouth. Footsteps. Then silence. The kid was gone.  
     Later, under flickering lights in the precinct hallway Ray sat with his jacket soaked in blood and arm stitched.        
You think he was working alone? An officer asked. Ray didn‚Äôt answer. He turned to Noah who clutched an ice pack to his head which had almost stopped bleeding.                                    
Was he the one that sent you the note, asked Ray. Noah stared at the floor.         
I don‚Äôt know for sure but I really don‚Äôt think so. Ray nodded slowly.             
Then he‚Äôs still out there. Ray stood and left without a word. 
     Noah got to a hotel way after midnight, he couldn‚Äôt go back to the apartment. Not when the killer knew where he lived. His head throbbed, his hands shook. He locked the door, and sat at a small table in the back of the room by a window. He took out the note from his pocket and lay it on the table. He unfolded it again and read the line;
	YOU KEEP WATCHING THE CRACKS ILL KEEP WIDENING THEM.
He picked up the photo, something tiny flickered in the corner of the frame. A bracelet. Not Coby‚Äôs or Ray‚Äôs. Erin‚Äôs. He gawked at it in horror and confusion for a long time. Then he calmly slid the photo into his pocket. The city outside stung like a fresh wound.

Beef Wellingtons prepped solo - no group bake tonight.
Mushroom queen with a deadly dream,
‚ÄúJust some fungi from the Asian store‚Äù - or so it seemed!

She loves ‚Äòshrooms, that‚Äôs a known fact,
But that shelf had a Tupperware deathcap snack.
For MONTHS, it sat - conveniently stored,
Till dinner was served, one guest  eating more.

Erin, Erin, what did you do?
Turned Saturday lunch into mushroom stew.
But it ain‚Äôt the meal that got all the fame-
It‚Äôs the EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA that stole the game!

Erin P‚Äôs tale, too wild to ignore,
White pants + poop = public folklore.
It probably ain‚Äôt something you want to hear,
But Erin Patterson‚Äôs got that booty gear!

She said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall, I was sick, a Code Brown scare,
Booty volcano blew mid-air!‚Äù
Had to pull over - bushes the site,
Doggy bag in purse?  Man, that ain‚Äôt right.

Hit the servo loo, just nine seconds inside,
No handwashing, no flush, just a bathroom drive-by.
No coffee, she says, but her son said ‚ÄúNah,
She sipped that flat white like a caffeine star.‚Äù

Everything‚Äôs wrong?  That‚Äôs what she claims,
Cross-exam like, ‚ÄúNope, I got my own frames.‚Äù
‚ÄúI disagree‚Äù - her favourite line,
Truth or memory? It‚Äôs a slippery sign.

Phone A?  Wiped.  Phone B? Same.
Phone C?  A mystery deep in the game.
She binged orange cake, then purged on the sly,
But tox reports said that alibi‚Äôs a lie.

Fed the kids scraps, sans mushroom paste,
No liver damage - hmm, what a taste!
And mushroom foraging?  She says it‚Äôs her lore-
But her fam be like, ‚ÄúGirl, we never saw you before.‚Äù

Erin, Erin got poop in her purse,
Truth gets murky, and the lies get worse.
Booty volcano, the mudslide mix,
On trial, dodging‚Äô facts linguistic tricks.

It probably ain‚Äôt something you wanna hear,
But Erin Patterson‚Äôs explosive rear.
From Wellys to the witness stand,
She‚Äôs the queen of the most diarrhetic brand.

So next time you‚Äôre cooking‚Äô up mushroom stew,
Better know what you‚Äôre foragin‚Äô - and who it‚Äôs for too.
Erin says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I remember it‚Ä¶‚Äù.
But Australia‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYo, we ain‚Äôt forgettin‚Äô it‚Äù.

She had been scrubbing for hours, the skin on her hands raw and red from pushing the brush back and forth. The stain however, wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. Elizabeth had no idea where it had come from, she prided herself on keeping a clean house and was quick to remove anything she deemed ‚Äòdirty‚Äô. Spillages were cleaned before they could touch the surface they hurtled towards, and spiders actively stayed away from the house - not wanting to end up as eight legs twitching on a tissue. Although she didn‚Äôt have many visitors, she maintained that it was always good to be prepared, not wanting to be caught short with an unclean or messy house.



Which is why Elizabeth had been horrified to find the small black penny-sized spot on her red kitchen floor tiles that morning. Upon inspection, she had been surprised to see that edges of its circle were crisp, there were no splatter marks to indicate that it had been dropped or smudges to suggest it had been smeared. The stain was so black it didn‚Äôt reflect any light in the kitchen, and when she looked she could see that it wasn‚Äôt shiny, it was matte. The stain was peculiar, and very annoying. When she touched it with her finger, no residue came off, and it didn‚Äôt smell. If anything, it had a strange absence of smell.



She spent the morning using every cleaning product she owned but the stain wouldn‚Äôt budge. Her home remedies were depleted. She had used her supply of vinegar, baking soda and lemons until she ran out, and was forced to move onto the strong chemicals that crept up her nose and burned the back of her throat as she scrubbed. When she sat back to wipe sweat off her brow, the spot was still there, looking exactly the same as it had that morning.



As her knees ached and her palms were bruised from pushing, she knew it was time to stop for the day. She stood slowly, ignoring the pain in her back as it cracked, and made herself a mug of mint tea. She settled down in her sitting room and thumbed through the papers passed down by her grandmother and mother, a folder full of tips and tricks for cleaning and life that she had always treasured. Elizabeth hoped that maybe within this folder there would be a page that she had somehow miraculously missed relating to small black stains on kitchen floors, but unfortunately it was full of the pages she had read and reread a hundred times before.¬†



It was time for a last resort. She pulled her overnight stain remover out of the cupboard and sprayed the spot liberally, watching as the liquid fizzed and bubbled over the black. She coughed, trying not to inhale the disgusting sulphur smell. Elizabeth reheated leftovers on the stove and ate quickly, trying not to look at the spot, before taking herself up to bed.¬†



The next morning, she practically skipped down the stairs in anticipation, desperate to see the results of her overnight cleaner. She imagined the black being cracked, small separate pieces of residue that could be neatly wiped up and forgotten about. However, when she got there she was shocked to find that the spot was now the size of a tennis ball, and that there was no trace of the stain remover that would usually leave a white chalky residue. She was baffled, it didn‚Äôt make sense, that stain remover had always worked and yet somehow, the stain had grown overnight.¬†



Elizabeth had read an article years ago about mould and how devastating it could be. An entire family had been killed by rice that was left out at room temperature, spores had gotten into the dish and poisoned the lot of them. She shuddered. Her house had always been so clean, she had worked hard to make sure it was perfect, but what if a spore had flown in through the window and settled on her floor?



¬†She rushed to the bookcase and flipped through any and every book she had that mentioned mould. Her collection of books was vast, and yet she found nothing that looked or sounded like the spot in her kitchen. The strangest thing about the stain was that it didn‚Äôt look organic. It looked as if someone had placed it there and walked away. Even though her suspicions of mould couldn‚Äôt be confirmed, Elizabeth opened the kitchen window to let some fresh air in, praying that it wasn‚Äôt read as an open invitation to other spores in the area.¬†



She took four cans of sugar free baked beans from her cupboard and carefully covered the spot with cling film, placing the tins around the edge to hold it down, noticing that as she did, the clear plastic dipped- almost as if it was being sucked down. Elizabeth put her head against the kitchen floor to look at the stain side on and saw that it was in fact dipping. This was worse than she thought, the mould was eating through her tiles. She finished quarantining the area and left the room, pulling the door firmly shut behind her and going upstairs to shower.¬†



Elizabeth had a fitful sleep that night, she dreamt that she touched the spot, and as she did, blackness crept up her fingers and hand, consuming her arm and spreading like a poison over her collarbones. It dripped down her back agonisingly slowly, great globs of black, cold and squirming, feeding off of her skin, before moving up her neck and trickling towards her face- She woke with a start and turned on her bedside lamp, looking at her hands in the pale yellow glow of the room and breathing a sigh of relief when she saw the same wrinkled, liver spotted skin she was used to. Hands that reminded her of her mother‚Äôs.¬†



The next morning she was hesitant to go downstairs, her dream had shaken her, but she was forced to venture to the kitchen, unable to ignore her hunger. As she entered, she told herself to ignore the spot completely, just eat and leave. She chewed her breakfast quickly and managed to steadfastly ignore the stain. She was pleased with herself, but as she got up to leave the room her eyes moved involuntarily and fixed on the thing she had been avoiding.¬†



The cling film and beans had vanished, and the spot was now the size reminiscent of a small well. She felt pulled towards it, like it was drawing her in. It had morphed into a hole, a deep black hole in her kitchen floor. Instinctively she grabbed a wooden spoon and grasped it tightly over the edge of the hole, thinking it must be some sort of optical illusion and that the spoon would bounce off the tiles. She leant forward, careful not to let her feet get too close, and released her grip. To her horror, the spoon went tumbling down until it was completely consumed by the darkness. Elizabeth listened for the sound of it hitting the bottom, her arm still poised from the release, but heard nothing. There was no bounce or echo or crash, just a long and eerie silence.¬†



She exhaled a long breath she didn‚Äôt know she was holding and lowered her aching arm. Blinking, she saw that the room was much darker than it had been. She was baffled to see the moon through the window, hanging above her. Minutes before it had been late morning, but when she looked at her watch, it was nine o'clock at night. It made no sense. Elizabeth rubbed her temples, and glared at the hole. She decided that to see what was happening once and for all, she had to watch it overnight.¬†



She laid a clean tablecloth on her kitchen table before rolling out her duvet on top for padding- the wood would not be forgiving to her bones. She brewed the strongest cup of coffee she could to ensure that she wouldn‚Äôt fall asleep.¬† Carefully hoisting herself up onto the table with the aid of a chair, she clutched her coffee and pillow and covered herself with a blanket, bracing herself for the night ahead.¬†



Drinking coffee at night would usually leave Elizabeth feeling jittery and wide awake- but for some reason, maybe the stress of the last few days, it wasn‚Äôt having its usual effect. She fought sleep for as long as she could, but her eyelids felt heavy and eventually she let the wave of sleep she was fighting wash over her.¬†



Elizabeth stirred to the soothing sound of her mother‚Äôs voice calling her name. It was the sound of being called back inside for dinner after playing outside in sticky summer heat all day. She could feel the grass under the soles of her feet, the tree branches brushing over her arms as she darted between them to get home. The thin fabric of her dress billowed behind her, lilac in her peripheral vision. Her hair was long and loose, lifting to the wind as she hopped the stile and ran over the short field to her house. She paused at the gate, she could still hear her mother, could smell the beef stew simmering on the stove as it wafted through the window, but something was wrong. Elizabeth ached to follow the sound inside the familiar cottage, to run into her mother‚Äôs arms for a long hug and laugh as she was tutted at for getting her dress dirty, but she couldn‚Äôt, She knew she couldn‚Äôt because her mother had been dead for over thirty years.¬†



Elizabeth opened her eyes properly and found herself not on the kitchen table, but instead standing beside the hole, her toes curled over the edge. Her arms flailed as she caught her balance and stepped backwards at lightning speed away from the hole- although now a more accurate word would be chasm. It was so large there was hardly any space around it, and its sides were touching the bottom of her cabinets. She looked at the clock and saw that it was gone three in the morning.¬†



She needed to get away from it, away from the house,¬† she couldn‚Äôt go through the front door, that meant going near the hole and there was a risk of getting stuck, of time passing without her knowing. She ran out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind her and moving frantically to the living room. She opened a window and climbed out,- her nightdress catching on a nail by the latch and ripping the soft fabric. Elizabeth didn‚Äôt care, all she cared about was getting away from the chasm.¬†



For the first time in decades, she ran. She ran until her legs burned and her lungs felt like they would explode, until her whole body felt numb from the cold morning air rushing past her. She ran so fast she didn‚Äôt feel like her legs were her own, that they might take off without the rest of her. Elizabeth didn‚Äôt know where she was going, just that she had to keep moving. She was running, and running, and as she ran, Elizabeth began to taste the sweet tang of orange juice on her tongue. She slowed and swallowed thickly, the taste becoming stronger as she did. She looked down and saw that the white nightdress she was wearing was now thin and lilac. Stained with moss and mud and grass from her youth. The skin on her hands was smooth, and her mother was calling her home.¬†



Elizabeth opened her eyes and found herself standing at the edge of the chasm in her kitchen once again, her mother‚Äôs sing-song voice echoing from deep in the hole, calling to her. She looked past her wrinkled, liver spotted hands and felt no fear, just the ache to be at home in that cottage. She took a breath and stepped forward into the darkness.¬†

I woke up to the soft glow of morning light filtering through the curtains, casting a warm hue across the room. For a moment, everything felt quiet and still‚Äîuntil I remembered.

We‚Äôre married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast‚Äîthough whether it would turn out edible was another story.

Still, as I stood there, staring at the coffee maker like it held the secrets to marriage itself, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a quiet kind of happiness.


Hi everyone, I am looking to rp as two newlyweds. I would like to include a set of dice or random number generator with random events to make the plot more fun. This would create a set of fun plotlines that really invigorate the story. 

First grocery trip together ‚Äì They realize they have very different shopping habits and debate over which brand of peanut butter is superior.

Cooking disaster ‚Äì One of them tries to cook a romantic meal but forgets a key ingredient or burns something.

Lazy rainy day ‚Äì They stay in pajamas all day, build a blanket fort, and watch old movies.

First big purchase ‚Äì They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night ‚Äì One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare ‚Äì One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption ‚Äì They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong ‚Äì They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws ‚Äì A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry ‚Äì They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences ‚Äì One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating ‚Äì They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Surprise gift exchange ‚Äì They both try to find the perfect small gift for each other and end up with funny or touching results.

Midnight snack runs ‚Äì They sneak out late at night in pajamas to grab ice cream or fast food.

Anniversary plans gone awry ‚Äì Their first-month or first-year celebration doesn't go as expected but turns into a great memory anyway.",1,1749873009.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

i am 27 years, 4 months, and 29 days old. emotionally printed in black & white.  
and if you're reading this, it probablly means the healing didn‚Äôt stick.

i think i was fine for 3.5 days.  
i smiled at a dog. i whistled in the lift. i even replied to a work email with a ‚Äúsure thing :)‚Äù  
do you know what kind of mental delusion it takes to type a smiley in lowercase?  
i thought i was healed.  
but turns out, i was just running on the free trial of stability.

on day 4, the crash came like my mother‚Äôs chappal unexpected, precise and karmically deserved.  
it began with a loose bedsheet corner that kept slipping off at night.  
i fixed it 4 times.  
on the 5th time, i stared at it and thought,  
‚Äúthis is love effort that never holds.‚Äù

i tried to make coffee but the decoction spilled.  
the stain looked like my old therapist. i apologized to it.

the thing is no one tells you that after healing, the world doesn‚Äôt pause and give you a certificate.  
you just return to the same ceiling fan. same toothpaste. same traffic jam that smells like capitalist depression and hot idli steam.

i texted a friend:  
‚Äúi feel empty again.‚Äù  
he sent back a mrme.  
a cat wearing sunglasses saying ‚Äúvibe check failed.‚Äù  
we laughed.  
i muted him for 3 days.

my mother asked why i haven‚Äôt been talking much.  
i said ‚Äúthroat infection.‚Äù  
truth is silence has become a comfortable language in my echos.  
i speak fluent awkward nods and passive aggressive Spotify playlists now.

i downloaded Bumble again.  
matched with a girl who said she‚Äôs ‚Äúemotionally available but mentally on Airplane Mode.‚Äù  
i sent: ‚Äúsame. i‚Äôm emotionally delivered, mentally returned to sender.‚Äù  
she unmatched.

i made maggi. overcooked it.  
added lemon. added guilt. added crusshed red hope.  
tasted like loneliness with a dash of ‚Äúi should call my dad‚Äù

sometimes i sit in my bathroom with the shower off, just letting the echo of water from the neighbour‚Äôs tap pretend like it‚Äôs raining.  
i call it ‚Äúmethod acting for sadness‚Äù

once a crow brought me a rubber band.  
not a sign. not a miracle. just a soggy rubber band.  
i wore it around my wrist like a friendship band from the universe.  
it snapped in an hour.

i walk past couples and pretend i‚Äôm part of their montage.  
like if i walk slow enough, someone will loop me into their forever.  
but no.  
i am always the ‚Äúmeanwhile‚Äù guy  
the background glitch.  
the one you remember 3 years later and go ‚Äúoh damn wonder how he‚Äôs doing‚Äù

i went to a therapst again.  
new one.  
he had LED lights in his room.  
the kind you see in Twitch streams.  
i told him, ‚Äúmy heart feels like a pdf that won‚Äôt open‚Äù  
he nodded. gave me a worksheet.  
i haven‚Äôt opened it.  
because even healing now comes in downloadable form with password protection and guilt updates.

my ex posted a reel with the caption ‚Äúself love is a journey‚Äù  
i wanted to comment: ‚Äúhope the journey has potholes‚Äù  
but i didn‚Äôt.  
i‚Äôm mature now.  
i just screenshot it, sent it to my best friend and wrote: ‚Äúgodspeed to whoever dates her next‚Äù  
and i kept laughing for 3.5 days, thinking danm i'm so funny.

i saw two pigeons fighting over a paper straw.  
watched them for 11 minutes.  
felt more real than most of my relaationships.

sometimes i look at my ceiling and think  
if i hang a dreamcatcher here will it trap all these recurring 3am thoughts?  
but then i remember dreamcatchers don‚Äôt work on guys who dream in error 404s.

but yeah.  
if you ask me how i am today,  
i‚Äôll say ‚Äúfine‚Äù  
because it‚Äôs easier than explaining that i‚Äôm a half-downloaded person trying to live in a fully-updated world.  
still buffering. still glitching.  
still alive.

if you're still reading this:  
hi. i love you. not in a weird way.  
or maybe yes, in a deeply weird, IKEA-instructions level confusing way.

let‚Äôs rot with grace.  
let‚Äôs laugh with broken teeth.  
let‚Äôs drink coffee like it‚Äôs a hug from the void.  
let‚Äôs scroll endlessly and pretend we‚Äôre looking for meaning.  
maybe one day, healing will come and stay.  
maybe god will remember to press ‚Äòsave.‚Äô

until then,  
i‚Äôll be here, in the lift, not pressing any buttons,  
listening to elevator jazz and crying in lowercase.

Samantha and Jack never met. But they both lived in the same city, shared a love of pad thai leftovers, and were slowly losing their minds one swipe at a time.

Jack, a human thumb with a Fitbit and a vague marketing job, treated Tinder like it owed him something. Every night, sprawled in bed beneath an LED light designed to mimic ‚Äúreal sun,‚Äù he would scroll through women like he was trying to choose which sushi roll to marry.

Swipe left: too many filters.
Swipe left: holding a fish.
Swipe left: ‚ÄúKitten, 24‚Äù with a bio that simply read rawr.
Swipe right: ‚Äúlikes hiking, hates drama.‚Äù Might as well propose.

He matched. He messaged. She responded. Five minutes later she sent a gif of a raccoon waving. This was the emotional climax of their relationship. Two days later, she unmatched. Jack didn‚Äôt even notice. He was already 30 swipes deep into his next dating sprint, dopamine flickering like a busted neon light.

Across town, Samantha downloaded Hinge again. This was her fourth time. Hinge liked to say it was ‚Äúdesigned to be deleted,‚Äù but what it actually meant was that it would emotionally exhaust you until you deleted yourself from society.

Samantha had recently escaped a situationship with a man who referred to her as ‚Äúhis person‚Äù but also never stopped sleeping with his ex. She selected her profile prompts like they were personality-defining tattoos. For ‚ÄúTruth or dare?‚Äù she wrote:

Truth: I once ate an entire wheel of brie in one sitting and cried through two seasons of Great British Bake Off.

Sixty-seven men liked the prompt.
All sixty-seven asked if she had any more brie.
One sent a picture of his dog.
One sent a picture of his feet.
One wrote: ‚Äúdamn. marry me lol unless ur crazy. wait r u crazy? lol.‚Äù

She deleted the app for the fifth time.

Meanwhile, Jack tried Bumble, where women message first and men die waiting. He liked the idea of being pursued. He imagined confident, witty women sliding into his DMs with clever banter and bold sexual energy.

Instead, he matched with three women who all opened with:

‚ÄúHey üôÇ‚Äù

He replied:

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

Then silence. The kind of silence you could rent out as an Airbnb to monks.

On the other side of the same platform, Samantha gave Bumble a shot too. She stared at a shirtless man posing with a tranquilized tiger and typed:

‚ÄúHeyyy üôÇ‚Äù

He responded 11 hours later with:

‚Äúwyd?‚Äù

She threw her phone into her laundry basket and muttered ‚ÄúI hate men‚Äù like a prayer.

Back on Hinge, Jack matched with someone who described herself as a ‚Äúsapiosexual empress of chaos.‚Äù She asked what his love language was. He replied:

‚ÄúNachos.‚Äù

She never responded. He began to suspect this might not be fun anymore.

Samantha finally matched with a man named Tyler who seemed promising. He had a rescue dog, an MFA, and a favorite tree. They talked for a week. He asked deep questions, referenced obscure poetry, and suggested an actual coffee date.

The morning of the meetup, he texted:

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not in the right place emotionally right now. You seem amazing tho.‚Äù

Three days later he was back on the app, looking for someone ‚Äúreal.‚Äù

Eventually, Jack and Samantha matched on Tinder. They chatted about dogs, brunch, and how everyone seems emotionally damaged by brunch. Samantha sent a raccoon gif. Jack laughed. They planned to meet. It rained. She rescheduled. He got a cold. She deleted the app. He forgot her name.

They never met.

But maybe they didn‚Äôt need to. Because in Swipeworld‚Ñ¢, no one‚Äôs actually dating. They‚Äôre just swiping through possibility, like scrolling through Netflix and watching nothing.

And somewhere, in some quiet bedroom glowing with the blue light of quiet desperation, Jack swiped. Samantha redownloaded.
They both thought:

Maybe just one more.

I have been in a relationship with this beautiful girl for the last two years. For the past six months, things have been on and off between us, but I genuinely loved her and never considered it a real breakup. It was just those small one or two-day fights that couples go through.

About a year ago, she met a guy on Instagram who is a gym trainer. She started talking to him during the time we were on and off, but we were still together. When I asked her what they talked about, she deleted the Instagram chat. That was the first red flag, and I ignored it. That should have been a wake-up call for me. But I was too attached and emotionally involved, so I forgave her after five or six days because she apologized and cried in front of me. I gave in and forgave her.

After that, our relationship went smoothly for four to five months. Then recently, we had a disagreement. It was not exactly a fight, but she said she did not want to be with me anymore because she was struggling with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). She was impulsive with her decisions and mentally not in a stable place, so she stopped talking to me.

I tried really hard to make things work. I told her that we would figure everything out together. I said that I did not want to leave her, that we could go to therapy, and I would support her through her mental health struggles. But she kept blocking and unblocking me on social media, possibly because of her emotional instability. Eventually, she blocked me from everywhere and told me that she was not a good person. Looking back, I wish I had accepted that truth back then.

During those twenty days of no contact, I started drinking because I could not sleep or handle the emotional pain. On the twenty-first day, she texted me saying she realized her mistake and wanted to come back. I told her how I had been drinking often during that time, and she cried, saying things like what if something had happened to me.

We talked for five to six hours straight, discussed everything, and decided to fix things. We agreed to meet in person. The next day, we met at a hotel, talked everything out, became intimate, and I gave her a ring. She had thrown away all my previous gifts during one of our breakups, and now she was regretting it.

But the next day, she told me something that broke me. She said she had made a mistake and felt guilty. She told me she had messaged that gym guy and they met for the first time in a hotel room, where she kissed him. She told me this herself and said nothing else happened.

After hearing that, I felt completely shattered. I was at work when she told me, and only I know how hard it was to hold back my tears and control my anger. I had done everything for her, stood by her through her toughest moments, and yet she still chose to betray me.

I messaged her and abused her verbally. I called her horrible names, and honestly, I do not regret it. Throughout our entire relationship, I never flirted with another woman or even looked at one in that way. And this is what she did to me.

She kept crying and apologizing, saying it was a mistake, that she did not love him and only loved me. She begged me not to leave. But I blocked her from everywhere, and now I truly hate her.

The reason she gave for doing all of this was that she was influenced by her sister, who told her to move on from me and forget me. That is why she met that guy. But I do not understand how anyone could agree to meet someone in a hotel room on their very first meeting.

That is when I realized what she truly wanted.
I know I will not forgive her. But I do not know how to move on from this.",1,1749872731.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

i went to a therapst again.  
new one.  
he had LED lights in his room.  
the kind you see in Twitch streams.  
i told him, ‚Äúmy heart feels like a pdf that won‚Äôt open‚Äù  
he nodded. gave me a worksheet.  
i haven‚Äôt opened it.  
because even healing now comes in downloadable form with password protection and guilt updates.

my ex posted a reel with the caption ‚Äúself love is a journey‚Äù  
i wanted to comment: ‚Äúhope the journey has potholes‚Äù

i‚Äôm mature now.  
i just screenshot it, sent it to my best friend and wrote: ‚Äúgodspeed to whoever dates her next‚Äù  
and i kept laughing for 3.5 days, thinking danm i'm so funny.

i saw two pigeons fighting over a paper straw.  
watched them for 11 minutes.  
felt more real than most of my relationships.

sometimes i look at my ceiling and think  
if i hang a dreamcatcher here will it trap all these recurring 3am thoughts?  
but then i remember dreamcatchers don‚Äôt work on guys who dream in error 404s.

but yeah.  
if you ask me how i am today,  
i‚Äôll say ‚Äúfine‚Äù  
because it‚Äôs easier than explaining that i‚Äôm a half-downloaded person trying to live in a fully-updated world.  
still buffering. still glitching.  
still alive.

if you're still reading this:  
hi. i love you. not in a weird way.  
or maybe yes, in a deeply weird, IKEA-instructions level confusing way.

let‚Äôs rot with grace.  
let‚Äôs laugh with broken teeth.  
let‚Äôs drink coffee like it‚Äôs a hug from the void.  
let‚Äôs scroll endlessly and pretend we‚Äôre looking for meaning.  
maybe one day, healing will come and stay.  
maybe god will remember to press ‚Äòsave.‚Äô

until then,

listening to elevator jazz and crying in lowercase.

I had paranoia and other psychosis symptoms on and off (occasionally after a couple months it would stop and start again later) 
Paranoia that got steadily worse up until now where I'm not taking any classes and am not drinking coffee this summer. It's not been perfect but it's been better. (Didn't go to a psychiatrist, didnt get prescribed meds. Where I am therapists are qualified to diagnose.)

My therapist says he thinks I'm developing something along the lines of schizophrenia but apparently that includes cognitive decline and a bunch of negative symptoms, which aside from burnout(that got better, more so now that I'm actually taking a break) and at times having issues with seeming a bit flat emotionally, I don't have. 

It's been going in for at least a year but I think I've had similar issues for an unknown amount of time prior and this also coincided with me taking harder classes and bring a full time college student. Admittedly me not caring how I dressed and being spiritual in a certain way was a red flag. 

However...I'm not sure where the line is between denial and just straight up ""it's literally not that severe of an issue"". I do admit right now that I have issues and that some of what I thought actually shouldntve ever made sense, and in the past I didn't but I do now...so? 
Not sure how to bring this up without sounding like I'm in denial however I do think my therapist was trying to be very very proactive.  

Admittedly some of the things I thought and experiences were huge red flags given that I'm a woman in my 20s. But still.... sure this could just be denial I guess... ",1,1749872247.0,mentalillness,1,1.0,False

1laz27h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1laz27h/aita_for_getting_mad_about_not_getting_a_birthday/,AITA for getting mad about not getting a birthday gift,"My (57 M) boyfriend and I (53 F) have been together for five years.  Just after Christmas I told him that I had been harboring some resentment because he had said he could ‚Äúsee himself marrying me‚Äù and it‚Äôs 5 years in and he tells people that we‚Äôre dating, even though we live together.  My life plans at this age are to be with my forever person.  I don‚Äôt want to be someone‚Äôs temporary person. He said he didn‚Äôt see the point of marriage.  I said, so many reasons, not the least of which being that if one of us ends up in the hospital, we‚Äôre nothing, we can‚Äôt even go in the room.  He blew me off.  I was devastated.  I said let‚Äôs end this now then.  He said, no, no, I didn‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt want to get married, I just said I don‚Äôt see the point of it.  
Fast forward to my birthday months later.  We go out for dinner, we go stand alone by the ocean at sunset, I was kinda sad because he didn‚Äôt kiss me, and then well, sadder when we went to bed that night and there was no birthday gift at all.  We‚Äôve always given each other gifts for everything.  
I said, when it was now after midnight, so not even my birthday, ‚ÄúDid you get me a birthday present?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh yeah.  It‚Äôs on order though.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
Pause‚Ä¶
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those running watches.‚Äù
Which is what his friend got his wife, that he‚Äôd told us about recently at coffee.  
I said, which I shouldn‚Äôt have said, but he knew EXACTLY what I meant.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I want.‚Äù
He knew I was referring to an engagement ring.  
Weeks go by, no present.  I think ‚Äúokay, he may be having money issues, just chill‚Ä¶‚Äù
And then he gets an Amazon order for an expensive tool he bought himself and him and his friend go to the garage with it.  I walk out there and I‚Äôm beside myself.  
Later I say to him ‚Äúso, you bought yourself that but I don‚Äôt get a birthday present?‚Äù
‚ÄúI thought the experience on your birthday was enough. You‚Äôre being ridiculous right now.‚Äù 
The experience? Dinner?  
A month or so later, I still don‚Äôt feel good about it so bring it up again. and he says ‚Äúlook, we‚Äôve been over this, I‚Äôm done talking about it.‚Äù
He‚Äôs made it clear that he has zero intention of getting me a gift.  I can‚Äôt tell if he never had any intention of getting me a gift or if he‚Äôs not getting me a gift because I indirectly brought up marriage and AITA for doing that?

1laz1wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/1laz1wz/aigenerating_movie_parody_descriptions_combining/,AI-Generating movie parody descriptions combining with NIKKE.,"This one's just for fun with AI-generating text. Here's mine with How to Train Your Dragon, but with comedy, romance, and Doro.

**How to Train Your Syuen**  
*Rated PG-13 for excessive sass, corporate chaos, and dangerously cute Doro moments.*

In the post-apocalyptic world of Goddess of Victory: NIKKE, where humanity battles alien Raptures and corporate overlords, comes a side-splitting romantic comedy that redefines ""taming the beast."" Meet The Commander, a Rookie Commander that's a bumbling but big-hearted Counters squad leader who dreams of peace, love, and maybe a decent cup of coffee after reclaiming the surface. His life takes a chaotic turn when he stumbles upon Syuen, the pint-sized, sharp-tongued CEO of Missilis Industry, a fire-breathing dragon of a woman who runs her company like a dictating gremlin with a selfie stick.

Unlike the majestic dragons of Berk, Syuen is a 4-foot-11 bundle of corporate fury, armed with a clipboard, a superiority complex, and an army of NIKKEs who‚Äôd rather nap than fight. When the Commander saves Syuen from being turned into a NIKKE as punishment and involving a viral video of her yelling at a vending machine, they form an unlikely bond. Through hilarious misadventures‚Äîthink Syuen trying to ""motivate"" NIKKEs with PowerPoint presentations, the Commander accidentally launching a missile during a date, and a romantic hoverboard chase through a Rapture-infested mall‚Äîthe two discover that love might just be the ultimate weapon against corporate tyranny.

With the help of his quirky NIKKEs from the Counters squad like Anis (the sarcastic soda-guzzling sidekick), Neon (the firepower-obsessed spy), and Rapi (the stoic straight-woman who‚Äôs done with everyone‚Äôs nonsense), the Commander teaches Syuen to soften her edges, while Syuen shows the Commander how to stand up to the chaos of the Ark‚Äôs corporate politics. Expect laugh-out-loud moments, like Syuen‚Äôs attempt at a romantic dinner that ends in a food fight with sentient tofu, and a heart-melting confession scene interrupted by a Rapture invasion. Will the Commander and the Counters squad tame Syuen‚Äôs fiery temper? Will Syuen admit she‚Äôs falling for a guy who owns one shirt and a dream? And can they save the Ark from Missilis‚Äô latest ""innovative"" product: a self-destructing toaster?

***How to Train Your Syuen*** is a riotous blend of action, romance, and corporate satire, proving that even the fiercest CEOs can be tamed with love, patience, and a randomly well-timed hug from a Doro. Featuring stunning CGI battles, a swoon-worthy soundtrack, and more sass than a NIKKE squad on a coffee break, this parody will leave you laughing and shipping Commander x Syuen harder than a Rapture ships destruction.

**Doro Meme of the Day:**  
*Image: Doro, the adorable Missilis NIKKE, sitting on a pile of Syuen‚Äôs rejected business proposals, holding a tiny megaphone.*  
**Caption:** ""When Syuen says 'MERGE ALL THE RUST BUCKETS INTO A MEGA-TOASTER,' but Doro‚Äôs like, 'How ‚Äòbout we merge Commander and Syuen‚Äôs hearts instead?' #DoroSavesTheDay""",0,1749872086.0,NikkeMobile,1,0.29,False

i think i was fine for 3.5 days.  
i smiled at a dog. i whistled in the lift. i even replied to a work email with a ‚Äúsure thing :)‚Äù

i thought i was healed.  
but turns out, i was just running on the free trial of stability.

on day 4, the crash came like my mother‚Äôs chappal unexpected, precise and karmically deserved.  
it began with a loose bedsheet corner that kept slipping off at night.  
i fixed it 4 times.  
on the 5th time, i stared at it and thought,  
‚Äúthis is love effort that never holds.‚Äù

i tried to make coffee but the decoction spilled.  
the stain looked like my old therapist. i apologized to it.

the thing is no one tells you that after healing, the world doesn‚Äôt pause and give you a certificate.  
you just return to the same ceiling fan. same toothpaste. same traffic jam that smells like capitalist depression and hot idli steam.

i texted a friend:

1laz0pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICE_Raids/comments/1laz0pb/how_governments_spy_on_protestorsand_how_to_avoid/,How Governments Spy On Protestors‚ÄîAnd How To Avoid It,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL34WpoETds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL34WpoETds)  (transcript below)

Like they were depicting, it's like the yellow box that goes around the face type of thing. Now, that is very real. This technology is more and more available to law enforcement. - Although law enforcement have had access to facial recognition tools for about 20 years, they previously were only able to search government images such as mugshots. This changed in 2018 when many police departments started using Clearview AI, a facial recognition app that allows them to match photos from around the web. Once a photo is uploaded, the app pulls up matches found online along with links to the source of those photos. - \[Newsreader\[ Clearview says more than 600 law enforcement agencies across the country use this software. - Based on the person's facial geometry, the images are converted by the system into a formula measuring things like eye distance. This means that law enforcement can use any image to search for a person who doesn't currently have a police record and isn't known to authorities, and potentially identify them in seconds. - I wanted to ask you, since you've covered this a lot, how do you view the risk of these platforms as they proliferate? - To be quite frank, it freaks me the hell out. Image recognition is just really, really good now and cheaper to deploy and so you know, I think it's more just kind of accepting that this is just part of life. Like just commuting every day, you're probably being subjected to some of these systems in one form or another. It's not just the systems where you have face rec built in. It can be deployed after the fact if you're in people's pictures that are posted on social media, it can get uploaded to these systems and then you can get picked out of a crowd in that way. - \[Rioters\] USA! USA! - We saw that with, you know, the January 6th Insurrection videos that were posted to Parler and other social media platforms. - \[Newsreader\] News tonight, an Auburn man has been found guilty of federal charges for his actions during the January 6th insurrection. - You know, the FBI took those, they saw people in the videos, they went back and and kind of looked to see like, ""Okay, here's proof you were there."" Governments in 78 countries use public facial recognition systems with varying degrees of support from their citizens. Many countries use the technology without transparent regulations. In Russia, facial recognition tools have been used not only to detain people protesting the war in Ukraine, but also to identify and arrest opponents of the government before they joined any demonstrations. Reuters reported that the facial recognition systems used in Moscow are powered by Western companies including NVIDIA and Intel. Other companies such as Amazon have also launched software that allows users to build a facial recognition database using their own photos. These systems, they're everywhere and things that you might think could kind of thwart these systems, even like wearing a mask and these kinds of things, some of the technologies can get around that. I don't know what to do with that information to be honest. - There are a lot of police here. Are you not frightened? - We are, but you know, we are together. That gives a real power. - I am frightened. Of course I'm frightened. That's why I'm just covering up all my face just so that they cannot even, you know, find my ID, but me being afraid doesn't mean that I'm not going to be here today and fight for my future. - I agree 100% with what you were saying about how masks and other deterrent measures aren't always effective at defeating these identification technologies. But clearly they are at least somewhat effective sometimes because you know, in a lot of crackdowns we've seen in the last few years by multiple governments, like one thing they'll do is try to ban mask wearing in certain settings. Yeah, are there any other things, please tell me that you have more. - Yeah, I mean I think there are ways to minimize the data and thus minimize the risks. Just simple things like not shooting pictures and videos while you're at a protest so you're not capturing yourself and anybody else who's around you is one way to keep it out of some types of systems. Avoiding some systems is better than avoiding no systems. You are going to be subjected to this technology in one way or the other and you just kind of have to proceed as best you can and minimize your contributions to those systems as much as as possible. - CCTVs or security cameras have been ubiquitous for a few decades now. One could have thought 20 or 30 years ago, like, ""Well now everything is going to be captured on film all the time."" But there are limitations still to just how much data is stored, for how long. You know, there've been a lot of high-profile events around the world in recent years where there wasn't adequate security footage to really know what had happened. It's not like every step you take, someone is paying to run the system and store the data to identify you. \[subdued music\] - In 2010, ""Wired"" reported on federal agents friending crime suspects on sites like MySpace in order to see their photos, communications, and personal relationships. More recently, police have used companies like Dataminr to more easily sift through massive amounts of data in order to glean information about how protests are organized, to identify activists, and to piece together people's connections to each other. - So social media accounts, right? It's a lot of data on everyone who's using these platforms. But I kind of think of these surveillance technologies in two buckets. One would be if authorities want to find out more about a specific person, right? What has Andrew been posting about or saying and are there photos you know, of Andrew online? Things like that. But then the other one would be coming at it the flipped where it's like they're looking for anyone who has been talking about X thing, or you know, anyone marking their location in a certain place on a certain day. Authorities can go directly to the sites or they might wanna use a service that kind of pulls a ton of data from social platforms together, you know, aggregates all of it and getting kind of lists of names. It gives the ability to like have this vibe check. Like those platforms themselves aren't inherently a surveillance tool, right? Sometimes we use them for journalism. - I've used some of these services like Dataminr before and once you see just the fire hose of information that you can get access to when you use it, it's becomes clear just how easy it is to kind of figure out what is going on. Even if it's not obvious to you in your own like curated timeline. Just the use of them has become more widespread. You wouldn't know without doing some investigating, ""Definitely my local police department is using this or not."" That creates an environment where you have to assume that that's what's happening. - Steps like making your account private or setting something to expire quickly. Maybe they can help. But I wouldn't assume those types of settings can really truly protect data on big mainstream platforms. - An example of how social media surveillance was used can be found through the MPD surveillance of the George Floyd protests in 2020. It was found that the MPD collected data about protest events including dates, locations, organizers, and estimated crowd sizes. The MPD shared this information with the Secret Service, National Park Service, and the Department of Defense. - So I think the other huge advice is about data minimization and not posting about things that you worry about getting into other people's hands. There's a tension here with chilling speech, right? The nature of the internet is to share information, right? That's like the whole purpose of the platform. When you put stuff out there, it's hard to say like, ""Okay, it's out there but only for certain people,"" and control it. - Our perspective on it is probably a little bit different because we're journalists, we're kind of in the public eye in a way that some other people aren't, but I think anybody, no matter if you have one follower or a million, you should be really careful about what you post online and when you post it online. You know, if you're gonna post vacation pictures, I never post them while I'm actually on vacation. Because then that signal to somebody like, ""Hey, my house is empty."" You can apply that to all different types of risks and I think generally posting less is the way to go. - But also some people really wanna post or that's their like job, or you know, that's how they make money. It's just helpful to understand that the greater volume you're posting, the more there could be things you didn't think of that's exposing information that you didn't realize is now out there. \[subdued music\] - IMSI catchers, also known as cell site simulators and formerly referred to as StingRays, are devices that impersonate cell towers causing cell phones within a certain radius to connect to them. Initially designed for military and national security purposes, this technology has emerged in routine police use. Until recently, the use of IMSI catchers was withheld from the public. The FBI has even forced state and local police agencies to sign NDAs in order to use their devices. I mean, I find IMSI catchers fascinating just in that their use is really secretive, like there was a long time that police weren't allowed to say that they had them or that they were using them, so there's just- - And no one had seen one. - Right. Yeah, exactly. Can you tell us just a little bit about how that works? - These are devices that, at its core, just identify that your phone was physically in a certain location, like that's the baseline thing it's trying to achieve. Sometimes called an IMSI catcher because of this IMSI number that it's trying to pick up. They can work in different ways, they can work passively to just sort of sweep around and say what devices are in the area and let me try to, you know, decrypt their signal and catch that you know, an ID number. More often, they work actively as like a fake cell tower, taking advantage of the way the system works, that your phone is going to connect to the cell tower that's emitting the strongest signal in the area to give you the best service and then grab that ID number. Sometimes they can also potentially grab other stuff like unencrypted communications, like SMS text messages. It's important to know that one of the things that can happen when you bring a phone to an event like a protest is that the fact that you were there and potentially some other information could be sort of pulled out of the air by one of these devices. - Records show that IMSI catchers are used by 23 states and the District of Columbia, the DEA, ICE, FBI, NSA, and DHS, along with many additional agencies. In terms of how people gauge the risk of these, I mean for one thing, like you said, a lot of times they're looking to target one person or maybe a couple of people and it does end up looping in a lot of people just by the nature of how it works. But it's also one that I think is expensive and complicated to deploy and so it's probably not gonna be the top concern. If I were going to a protest, I don't think it's the thing I would be so concerned about, just as an average person. - Another thing in that vein, you know, if this technology that we're talking about is rogue cell towers, it means that actual cell towers also have all this information, right? Like your wireless provider knows where you go. So that data exists anyway and there are potentially other ways that, you know, authorities can get that information. \[brooding music\] - Geofence warrants, or reverse location warrants, allow law enforcement to request location data from apps or tech companies like Google or Apple for all devices in a specific area during a set time. Authorities can then track locations, identify users and collect additional data like social media accounts. - This is yet another layer in this multiple approaches to getting the same information: who was at a certain place at a certain time and what can we find out about what they were up to? - A lot of it's advertising data or what's being shared all the time from your device that you probably aren't paying much attention to and is used in a much more innocuous way typically. - And it's sort of slurping up all the data from this area, which is constrained in a way but doesn't account for passersby, people, you know, getting coffee at the deli next door, people just sort of coming up to a location to see what's going on. Like this is just bulk indiscriminate data. I am worried about it, but maybe not specifically. Like it's in the category to me of all the reasons that I might consider leaving a device at home or putting it in a Faraday bag. It's sort of just on that list of reasons that you might wanna minimize the data that your device is emitting. \[subdued music\] - Data brokers collect and sell personal data from public sources, websites, and apps people use every day. They aggregate all this info to build detailed profiles of people and to group them into simplified categories such as high income, new moms, pet owners, impulse buyers, and more. While advertisers are usually their primary clients, police can also purchase this data. Some of the largest data broker companies include Experian, Acxiom, and Equifax. The amount of data Equifax collected came to light in 2017 when a data breach exposed 147 million people's personal data. - I think it just fuels this ability to identify someone and track kind of their behavior across the web and potentially their speech. Similar to the way law enforcement can track people and surveil people through social media platforms, information from data brokers can aid investigations in two ways. They can be coming at it from a person of interest who they're trying to find out more about or authorities can be coming at it from, ""I want information on anyone who has had an IP address in this area or anyone who has keyword searched, you know, and been shown these types of ads."" - So how do data brokers collect information? The most common ways include web browsing history, everything from your Google searches, sites or apps you visit, cookies, social media activity, or even a quiz you just filled out for fun. All of that can be scraped and tracked. This data creates each person's online history map, which in turn allows brokers to build a profile on each user. The data that companies collect often include: name, address, phone number and email address, date of birth, gender, marital and family status, social security number, education, profession, income level, cars and real estate you own. It also comes from public sources. This can be anything in the public domain such as: birth certificates, drivers or marriage licenses, court or bankruptcy records, DMV records and voter registration information. It can also include commercial sources such as: your purchase history, loyalty cards, coupon use, and so forth. And finally, some websites or programs will ask for your consent to share your data. Sometimes it's anonymized in certain ways, especially when it comes to advertising data, but it's pretty trivial for law enforcement or other investigators to tie certain advertising behavior to a specific device, especially if it's collecting precise location data and there's also data brokers that are building network profiles so you can not just get information about yourself, but everybody you've interacted with, whether it's on social media or actually in real life. In the United States at least, we just lack laws that kind of regulate what these companies are able to collect. And if you have to participate in modern society, as nearly everyone does, it's almost impossible to avoid. I think in the context of protests, it's not an acute concern I would say, but it is generally speaking really freaky when the sky's the limit on what they could potentially use because there's just so much data. - I agree with what you said, sort of low on the acute scale, but high on the existential scale. \[subdued music\] - One of the big surveillance technologies that probably everyone who's driven on a highway knows about is license plate readers. Really just capturing what your license plate is and showing that your vehicle was at a certain place at a certain time. - Similar to like your phone, your car, it's a proxy for you. Maybe you were in the car, maybe you weren't, but that's where your car went. - There are three types of ALPR systems: stationary or fixed ALPR cameras, which are installed in a fixed location like a traffic light, telephone pole or a freeway exit ramp. The second type are mobile ALPR cameras, which are attached to police patrol cars, garbage trucks, and other vehicles, and allow them to capture data from license plates as they drive around the city. They can also assist law enforcement in gridding, which is when police officers drive up and down a neighborhood collecting license plates of all parked cars. There are also private vendors like Vigilant Solutions, which collect license plate data and sell that back to police. The third type are ALPR trailers, which are trailers police can tow to a particular area and leave for extended periods of time. It's been reported that the DE has disguised ALPR trailers as speed enforcement vehicles and placed them along the US-Mexico border. The things I'm concerned about aren't necessarily even it being used for license plates. Our colleague, Dhruv Mehrotra has done some reporting showing that license plates readers can also capture any words that are visible, so that can be what's on your t-shirt, that could be political signs in your yard. This technology may be able to be used in ways that we're not even familiar with or would imagine. You know, a lot of times when we're talking about any surveillance technologies, it's really about creating data that then is there and could potentially be used in any number of ways at any point in the future depending on who gets access to it and what they want to do with it. \[moody music\] - The key thing here is that these drones, even small quadcopters, like what we think of as consumer drones, they can carry a fair amount of cargo, meaning like cameras. - There are a number of different drones used by law enforcement varying in size and ability. For example, some drones have thermal imaging capabilities for night operations while others specialize in long periods of surveillance. Protestors have in the past reported drones flying overhead, for example in Minneapolis during the George Floyd protests. Police and government drones usually fly in the range of 11,200 feet above the ground. However, it's been reported that the drone used to surveil protests in Minneapolis in 2020 flew at 20,000 feet, nearly invisible to protestors on the ground. This was a Customs and Border Protection drone, which are often equipped with advanced cameras, radar, and potential cell phone geolocation tools. In terms of how freaked out are you about drones, how do you think about that? - Yeah, I would say fairly freaked out. But again, like you were saying about the layering of these technologies, I think it's not the drones themselves, it's everything they can do and how cheap they are and how easy it would be to deploy even more of this tech. When we talk about sort of evolution of different technologies, this capability is sort of similar to police helicopters and now it's just cheaper, lighter, easier. Even these sort of benign-seeming quadcopters that we see around all the time could be carrying equipment on them to do like very granular, detailed surveillance of something like a protest. \[subdued music\] - There are some technologies that are really just emerging and we don't even know if they've been used at protests or even used by authorities in the United States. - Right, and your face isn't the only thing sort of outside your body that can potentially identify you. For example, analyzing your gait, like how you walk. - Gait recognition technology can identify individuals by analyzing their unique walking patterns using machine learning. It captures movements through cameras, motion sensors, or even radar. It then processes this information, breaking it down into contours, silhouettes, and other distinguishing features. It offers high accuracy, but its effectiveness can be influenced by things like injuries or the types of terrain the subject is traversing. This tech is especially useful for authorities when people's faces are obscured. While there haven't been any reports of widespread use of this tech by law enforcement  agencies in the US, Chinese authorities have been utilizing it on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing since at least 2018. In recent years, there have also been a number of companies working on creating emotional detection technology where AI uses biometric data to determine a person's emotional state and the likelihood they will become violent or cause a disturbance. ""Wired"" reporting found that Amazon-powered cameras have been scanning passengers faces in eight train stations in the UK to trial this new technology. The trials were testing the system for age and gender recognition as well as the emotional state of the person on camera. While there's no current documentation of this tech being used at protests, the BBC reported that emotional-detection tech has been used on Uyghurs in China. - Some of these could be really invasive because you know, reading your emotions, there start to be maybe inferences that someone could make about how you were feeling in a certain moment that may or may not be accurate, right? Because it's sort of being taken out of context. So it's difficult to have an algorithm just sort of come to one conclusion. Like sometimes I think you're doing your angry walk coming over when I haven't filed my story, but really then you're really nice about it and you're like, ""It's okay Lily, you can do it."" And you know, I took it totally the wrong way. But potentially there are more sort of in terms of just identifying someone in a certain place. It is scary that there's something characteristic about your walk. They're not saying, ""Oh, it's Andrew's angry walk,"" but they're saying, ""Oh, that's Andrew."" - Certainly creating more systems that are replicating what other things like facial recognition do and applying it in to other biometrics of a person. That definitely is gonna create all the same concerns as we've seen with these other technologies that were emerging, you know, years or decades ago. But now it's your entire body, how you walk, and like you mentioned, like if we're having computers analyze like how I'm feeling in a certain moment, effectively establishing intent of whatever my actions are in that moment, that gets really scary because it might be completely inaccurate. Every time there's one of these new AI technologies, there's always some bias built in. There are gonna be people who suffer consequences unnecessarily because these systems are deployed without being fully debugged. Experts in the AI field have previously noted that emotional-detection tech is unreliable, immature, and some even call for the technology to be banned altogether. \[subdued music\] Here are a few simple and effective ways to protect yourself and your personal information at a protest. First, if you can, leave your phone at home, I know this might sound drastic, but the most effective way to ensure that your personal data isn't compromised and that your phone won't fall in the hands of law enforcement is by not having it with you. If that's not an option, you can put your phone in a Faraday bag so data can't be accessed. You should also turn off biometrics on your like facial recognition or fingerprint scanner, meaning you'll need a code to access it. That way your face or fingerprints can't be forcefully used to access your personal information. You can always say, ""You just don't remember the code. Don't unlock it."" Another thing to keep in mind is posting on social media. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU says, ""if you post something online, you should do so under the assumption that it might be viewed by law enforcement."" You should always check your sharing settings and make sure you know what posts are public. Try to minimize the amount of other people's faces you capture in your photos or videos, use end-to-end encrypted messaging services like Signal when possible, wear a mask in case photos or videos are taken, and finally, know your personal risks. Is your immigration status exposing you to additional dangers? Are you part of a minority group that is more likely to be targeted by law enforcement? Keeping these things in mind for yourself and your loved ones when deciding if you should go out to a protest. For more information about surveillance at protests, check out wired.com.

I was expecting really severe nicotine withdrawals, but I haven‚Äôt experienced that (yet?). I did have some slight fatigue and some twitching in my right foot, a couple days in, but it was minimal.

1layyu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1layyu4/constipationbloating_issues/,Constipation/Bloating Issues,"So about a week ago, I had an appointment at Urgent Care for abdominal pain/indigestion/possible constipation. Before going to Urgent Care, I tried Mag07 but it didnt help much. Dr concluded I was constipated, and sent me in for an x-ray just to see how backed up I was, and my results showed there was a ‚Äúconsiderable amount‚Äù of stool in my colon. Dr suggested I take Miralax & GasX to help. I tried Miralax the first day, then decided to try a stimulant laxative the next day (off brand Ex-Lax) to speed things up. I went, but it caused a lot of horrible cramping. Ended up trying Dulcolax a day later, as my mom said it worked better for her than the Miralax and not cramp-y like the other one. Felt more relief after, but I ended up going back to Miralax after a couple days as I was worried about how the Dulcolax would make me feel at work when a bathroom isn‚Äôt always accessible. Its been a week & 1 day since my appointment. I didnt take any form of laxative today. I was able to slightly go, but still not very much & I feel like I need to go more. Is this normal? When will my BMs go back to normal? 

My abdominal pain has gotten a lot better since last week, but still a lot of bloating. Should I continue trying out laxatives? I know laxatives state on the back to not use longer than a week without consulting a doctor. But idk if I kinda messed things up by trying several types of laxatives? Or should I check back in with the doctor at Urgent Care? Also want to note, I tried a coffee the other day when I thought I was feeling fine, but bad idea. My stomach was not great for a few hours after that. Cut out any dairy since then. I leave for a trip out of the country in a week, so I wanna get my stomach issues straight before thenüò≠",1,1749871807.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

Does anyone has any recommendations on how to properly treat and/or finish it to avoid having this constant issue?

I suspect the main reason is it's porosity and that it is not treated wood.

I'm a bit lost on where to start. I was thinking of sanding and applying a top layer that would seal the wood to avoid gathering moisture.

Chapter 1  
  
The day after we finished dividing up the assets from our divorce, I got into a car accident and lost my memory.  
  
Later, my ex-husband River Kane tracked me down. He said if I stopped acting crazy all the time, maybe we could get remarried.  
  
I was mid-bite on my ice cream spoon and just froze. After a long pause, I finally managed: ""Uh, no thanks! I mean... I... I'm actually totally fine just keeping the money.""  
  
...  
  
I woke up to find my best friend Mackenzie staring at me with this super worried expression plastered all over her face.  
  
""Hey, don't beat yourself up anymore, okay?"" she said, trying to sound all reassuring.  
  
""Look, your body is your temple, babe. Even if you're going through this divorce mess, you still gotta live your best life.""  
  
She sat down on the edge of my bed, fidgeting with her phone. ""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war‚Äîespecially when we both know how that's gonna end.""  
  
I just stared at her, my brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton. After what felt like forever, I finally managed to get the words out. ""Um... who the hell is River?""  
  
Mackenzie froze mid-sentence, looking at me like I'd just spoken in tongues. It took her a hot minute to snap out of it before she bolted to get the doctor.  
  
The doctor said I had memory loss from the car accident. Mackenzie immediately jumped in, asking how old I thought I was.  
  
I said without any hesitation. ""Eighteen. Didn't I just finish my SATs yesterday?""  
  
Mackenzie completely lost it. She literally crumpled to the floor, laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach and pounding the side of my hospital bed with her fist.  
  
""Willa, oh my GOD! This amnesia thing is like... the universe giving you the ultimate do-over! Yes! You're eighteen, baby! Eighteen and free! No River, no kid, no drama... just you and me against the world!""  
  
Now I was even more confused than before.  
  
Mackenzie took me back to her place once the doctors confirmed my memory probably wasn't coming back anytime soon.  
  
That's when she finally gave me the rundown on my apparently very messy life.  
  
Me‚ÄîWilla Reynolds‚Äîfell head over heels for some broke college guy named River during freshman year.  
  
I spent ten whole years with this dude, from eighteen to twenty-eight. Stuck by him while he was building his empire from nothing, lived off ramen and dreams, popped out two kids for him, and basically became his family's live-in caretaker.  
  
And this year? He decided to divorce my ass.  
  
""Wait, WHAT?"" I practically shrieked.  
  
This sounded like some tragic Lifetime movie bullshit.  
  
After I got over the initial shock, I asked in this shaky voice, ""So you're telling me I spent a decade being someone's unpaid servant, and then got kicked to the curb at twenty-eight?""  
  
Mackenzie nodded grimly. ""Yep. And you've got two kids‚Äîyour son's six, your daughter's four. But since you were a stay-at-home mom with zero income, and the kids chose to stay with daddy, River got full custody.""  
  
""Hold up... so I lost the kids I spent years raising too?""  
  
Even though I couldn't remember any of this, it sounded absolutely terrifying. I was about to start ugly crying.  
  
Then Mackenzie's whole vibe shifted, and she actually smiled while patting my shoulder. ""Hey, don't look so miserable. At least you're loaded now.""  
  
I blinked back tears and asked cautiously, ""How loaded are we talking?""  
  
Mackenzie sat up straight, looking way too pleased with herself. ""Willa, listen carefully. You walked away with twenty percent of River's assets, ten percent stakes in three publicly traded companies, and two historic townhouses in Manhattan. We're talking about nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Dead silence.  
  
I stared at her, then asked slowly, ""Mackenzie... you're not messing with me, right?""  
  
""If I'm lying, I'm literally a piece of shit.""  
  
That day, I spent hours just staring out the window at the sky.  
  
I'd lost ten years of memories. I had no clue what my life had been like during that time.  
  
But Mackenzie said I was rich as hell, and eighteen-year-old me had always been obsessed with money.  
  
So honestly? I guess this isn't too bad.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Mackenzie took time off work to help me sort through endless paperwork and property transfers.  
  
I never actually met this River guy‚Äîhe had his lawyers handle everything in the divorce settlement.  
  
After nearly a month of bureaucratic hell, Mackenzie helped me list all my properties as rentals.  
  
She did the math and told me I'd be pulling in about one-twenty thousand a month just in rent.  
  
That day, staring at my bank account with more zeros than I could count, I looked up at the mirror. The reflection showed a perfectly put-together twenty-eight-year-old version of myself.  
  
I scratched my head. Wow. Not bad at all.  
  
I had nothing but time on my hands while Mackenzie went back to work, so I basically lived at her place playing video games all day.  
  
She'd order food for both of us during lunch breaks.  
  
Mackenzie worked insane hours and would come home looking like death warmed over, collapsing on the couch like a zombie.  
  
I'd put down my controller and give her shoulder rubs. Apparently muscle memory was still intact because I was surprisingly good at it.  
  
Once she'd recovered enough to form sentences, she'd start ranting: ""River is such a piece of shit. Right after you graduated, you were basically his unpaid intern. And when his mom got sick, you'd come home from work just to give her massages and take care of her.""  
  
Mackenzie kept going, then suddenly grabbed my head and flicked my forehead. ""Willa, you were such a pushover! The second I wasn't around, you let them walk all over you. That whole family treated you like garbage because they knew you didn't have anyone else.""  
  
I rubbed my forehead, feeling genuinely hurt. ""Hey, I don't remember any of that stuff! All I remember is you.""  
  
Mackenzie stopped mid-rant, then broke into a huge grin. ""You're right! You don't remember, and that's perfect. Just remember me‚ÄîI'd never treat you like that.""  
  
I believed her completely, because Mackenzie and I grew up together.  
  
We were both foster kids.  
  
When we were little, I basically followed Mackenzie around everywhere. She'd fight other kids for snacks and help me with laundry.  
  
As we got older, she'd help me with homework. She was a year ahead of me, so when I was a senior, she was already in college, calling me every single day to keep me motivated.  
  
She wanted us to go to the same university, but Mackenzie was way too smart. Even when I studied my ass off, I couldn't get into Harvard like she did.  
  
The day our test scores came out, I just hugged her and cried.  
  
Mackenzie flicked my forehead again. ""What are you crying for? You got a 1480 on your SATs‚Äîthat's amazing!""  
  
She ruffled my hair. ""You did great.""  
  
I ended up crying all the way to Boston for college.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Talking about it just made Mackenzie feel guilty all over again. ""I never should've let you go to Boston in the first place. If you hadn't gone to Boston, you never would've met River. If you'd never met River...""  
  
I jumped in with the obvious answer: ""Then I wouldn't have nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mackenzie put her hands on her hips. ""What's more important‚Äîthe money or those ten years of your life?""  
  
I tried to guess the right answer: ""The money?""  
  
Mackenzie looked like she wanted to shake some sense into me. ""YOU'RE what's important! If you're miserable, all that money is worthless. Thank God you lost your memory, because if you remembered everything and did something stupid to yourself, what good would any of that money do?""  
  
""Well... it could buy me a really nice headstone...""  
  
Mackenzie cracked up despite herself. ""Oh my God, shut UP!""  
  
Mackenzie had always been incredible, and she still was. She was now a VP at some multinational corporation, pulling in around forty grand a month.  
  
But she was constantly swamped with work and business trips, and she worried about leaving me alone.  
  
So she started dragging me along everywhere. Eventually she figured if she had to babysit me anyway, why not put me to work?  
  
She got me hired as her assistant at her company.  
  
I was so ready for this! I'd spent months reading like fifteen different romance novels about powerful bosses falling for their assistants.  
  
On my first day, I strutted in wearing this killer business dress, feeling like I could take on the world.  
  
I made her coffee, organized her files, ran around doing errands.  
  
I was trying so hard to impress her that she finally started laughing and told me to chill. She handed me a spreadsheet and said, ""Have Ava show you the ropes on this. Take your time learning‚Äîno rush.""  
  
""Got it!""  
  
And just like that, I officially entered the workforce.  
  
I started following Mackenzie's schedule, but since I didn't have much on my plate, I usually got off work way earlier than her.  
  
Mackenzie, on the other hand, was buried in work. I'd hang out in the break room waiting for her to finish up every night.  
  
One day, Mackenzie caught me watching online tutorials on my phone and suddenly got serious. ""Willa, do you actually want to learn this stuff for real?""  
  
""Yeah... I really do.""  
  
With the memory loss, I was basically starting from zero at work. I kept screwing things up and it was getting pretty depressing.  
  
Mackenzie had always been my role model growing up, and that hadn't changed. I wanted to be as effortlessly competent as she was. She made everything look so easy and cool.  
  
So Mackenzie enrolled me in classes. After work every day, I'd drive to night school.  
  
I took project management courses mixed with software training programs.  
  
I filled up two entire notebooks before things finally started clicking. Oh, that's how it works!  
  
When I finished that program, Mackenzie signed me up for accounting and finance classes.  
  
After a full year of studying, I finally had my lightbulb moment.  
  
Everything made sense now, and work started feeling natural.

I am a rising sophmore interested in consulting (have a referral to EY and goal is Big 4 Consulting next summer). I am currently doing a full-time, in-person, paid internship at an accounting but doing more business development (marketing, market expansion, CRM, etc.) and also for a grocey store (client - marketing and also analyzed POS systems). However, I feel like I am not doing anything (I sit around 80% of the time) and my boss got at me today for taking coffee chats so I wouldn't get a recommendation for him. He also has no connections to big 4 Consulting (neither does anyone at the firm). It is planned that I am doing this internship until August.

I am a rising sophmore interested in consulting (have a referral to EY and goal is Big 4 Consulting next summer). I am currently doing a full-time, in-person, paid internship at an accounting but doing more business development (marketing, market expansion, CRM, etc.) and also for a grocey store (client - marketing and also analyzed POS systems). However, I feel like I am not doing anything (I sit around 80% of the time) and my boss got at me today for taking coffee chats so I wouldn't get a recommendation for him. He also has no connections to big 4 Consulting (neither does anyone at the firm).

He was crying and shrieking a lot when he was not distracted, eating, or drinking. He was up crying at night and breastfeeding with my wife (34 F) almost every hour when he usually sleeps at least three at a time. It was pretty bad, and I guess it also happened all day long according to my wife and driving my wife insane after a week. She cried a couple times saying that she couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and needed a break. When she went downstairs to cool off, she was just loudly complaining about how she is tired, she is overwhelmed, she's exhausted, she can't deal with all the screaming and breastfeeding and let out an ‚Äúarrrggghhh!‚Äù of anger. My son was still crying while I tried to distract him in our spare room, and then my wife came in and said she was going to put him to bed because he seemed tired. My wife took my son into his bedroom and all hell broke loose. He was literally screaming, crying, coughing, screaming some more. I hear my wife loudly say, ‚ÄúJamie*, seriously, I'm trying, little man!‚Äù and he just kept on screaming super hard. I have no idea what was going on but it sounded bad and I ran in there and asked my wife, ‚Äúwhat the fuck are you doing?!‚Äù I was just worried about my son. She asked, ‚ÄúWait, what? Are you serious?‚Äù and I said I was dead serious, what are you doing to him? She said, ‚ÄúI'm changing his diaper, douche bag.‚Äù which I could see she was. He was rolling all over the place, kicking, just freaking WAY out. As soon as my wife picked him up he stopped crying. My wife looked me dead in the eyes and said ‚Äúthat was not ok and I want a divorce.‚Äù 

This was three days ago, she hasn't spoken to me, is sleeping on a futon in the spare room, and left a divorce application on the coffee table. My son is no longer sick thank god and everything is back to normal. 

I told my mom about what is going on and she got mad and said ‚ÄúWhat the hell? You thought she was hurting him because he was crying?!‚Äù and yeah, I guess. I never heard him cry like that and my wife was obviously mad, so who really knows. I tried to apologize for how bad it sounded but she won‚Äôt listen.

1layogy,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1layogy/i_built_a_cv_matching_tool_that_recruiters_say/,I Built a CV Matching Tool That Recruiters Say Gives 100% Relevant Results - Here's How,"Last month, a recruiter challenged me to build something that seemed impossible - a CV matching tool that actually works. Not 70% accurate. Not ""pretty good."" But actually useful.

**The Problem**

Every CV matching tool out there uses fancy AI and gives terrible results. A recruiter told me he tested five different tools and they all suggested ridiculous matches. Senior developers for junior roles. Marketing managers for engineering positions. Complete waste of time.

**What Everyone Gets Wrong**

Most developers think more AI = better matches. I learned that's completely backwards. Recruiters don't need AI poetry. They need matches that make sense.

**The Solution**

I built a web tool that thinks like a recruiter, not a computer:

* Analyzes actual requirements vs nice-to-haves
* Understands salary expectations by market
* Checks commute feasibility
* Matches experience levels correctly
* Considers company culture fit

**How It Works**

1. Upload CV (PDF/DOC)
2. Select target location
3. Get 40+ relevant matches from LinkedIn/Indeed
4. Each match includes explanation of why it fits

Processing takes 30-60 seconds. No installation needed.

**The Results**

Tested with recruiters in Netherlands, UK, and Germany. They're reporting 100% of matches are actually relevant. Not perfect fits, but all worth considering.

One recruiter said: ""Finally, a tool that doesn't waste my time.""

**Technical Details**

* Web-based (works anywhere)
* Integrates LinkedIn, Indeed, and local job boards
* Rule-based matching with market-specific logic
* Processes in real-time

Built this in 9 weeks after three failed attempts. Sometimes you need to stop being clever and start being useful.

The boring approach won.

  
**EDIT:** About the JSON/workflow - I spent 10 days straight building this after multiple failed attempts. The core matching logic is proprietary (it's what makes this actually work compared to other tools), but the basic flow is:

1. CV parsing ‚Üí Extract skills, experience, location preferences
2. Job aggregation ‚Üí Pull from LinkedIn/Indeed APIs
3. Custom matching rules ‚Üí This is the secret sauce
4. Scoring & filtering ‚Üí Remove irrelevant matches
5. Output with explanations

I'm planning to offer this as a service since recruiters are already using it successfully. If you're interested in:

* Using the tool for your recruiting needs
* Custom implementation for your company
* Building something similar with my help

Feel free to DM me. Happy to discuss consulting options or usage pricing.

The 10 days of no sleep should at least buy me a few coffees, right?

But seriously, I learned a ton building this and I'm open to helping others tackle similar matching problems. Just know that the real work isn't in the code - it's in understanding how recruiters actually think.",1,1749870828.0,recruitinghell,3,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
""Seriously? You're worked up about him shaving?"" my best friend Riley let out an exasperated laugh. ""Since when is that a crime?""  
  
""He never shaves at night,"" I said quietly.  
  
""Oh come on, maybe he had a dinner meeting!""  
  
I shook my head firmly.  
  
""Riley, you know Edward. Home by seven, lights out by eleven - the man runs like clockwork. He hasn't done a business dinner in years.""  
  
""Right, because he's too busy being madly in love with you,"" Riley countered, her expression softening. ""Savannah, please tell me you're not actually worried about this?""  
  
I caught myself and managed a small laugh.  
  
""Of course not.""  
  
As if on cue, my phone lit up with Edward's call.  
  
""Sweetheart, Jenny mentioned you hardly touched your lunch. I've had Mark pick up some of your favorites from Bella's Kitchen. Get some food in you, take a little walk before your nap - and hey, I grabbed us tickets to that new Broadway show you've been wanting to see.""  
  
His voice carried that gentle warmth he reserved just for me, like someone speaking to their most precious person in the world.  
  
Riley was listening in, shaking her head in disbelief.  
  
""God, if anyone at New Star Media could hear their ice-cold CEO right now...""  
  
I couldn't blame her amazement. The Edward Reed that everyone else knew was all sharp suits and sharper decisions, the ruthless Wall Street legend who'd built an empire before forty. Sure, people knew he was devoted to his wife - but they had no idea just how deep that devotion ran.  
  
We'd been together for ten years, married for five, and this tender, attentive version of Edward had always been mine alone. He could recite my coffee order in his sleep, knew exactly which designer's new collection would catch my eye, could tell from a single text if I was having a rough day...  
  
Last summer, I stormed out after a fight about his overprotective streak. Spent the night at The Plaza. When I came home the next morning, I found him on our living room couch, still in yesterday's suit, looking like he'd aged years overnight. The moment he saw me, he crossed the room in three strides and pulled me close, his voice breaking: ""I'm so sorry, baby. Never again.""  
  
Then there was that weekend at the Hamptons last year. Our vacation villa caught fire while he was out grabbing my favorite ice cream. He tried to charge into the burning building - it took three security guards and the local firefighters to hold him back. Only when he heard me screaming his name from the pool house did he stop fighting them, his designer suit singed and smoking.  
  
He still has a scar above his eyebrow from that night. Every time I see it, my heart twists, but he just gives me that soft smile and says, ""My battle scar from being Savi's hero.""  
  
That's the thing about Edward's love for me. It's my constant, my true north - more reliable than gravity itself.  
  
And God knows I love him just as fiercely.  
  
Which is exactly why something as small as him shaving before bed...  
  
I noticed it instantly.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
They say Cancers are born worriers. Mix that with my mom's perfectionist DNA, and you've got someone who sees a red flag in every tiny change to routine.  
  
Normally when a guy shaves at night, he's heading to a business dinner. But Edward? He's got his routine down to a science - dinner at one of his regular spots, then straight home. No cocktail hours, no networking events, nothing.  
  
So what could possibly make Manhattan's most powerful CEO break his golden rule? Was there some crisis at New Star Media he was shielding me from?  
  
I had to see for myself. If everything was fine, great. If not, we'd face it together.  
  
I called Sarah. We'd been roommates all through NYU, and now she was CFO at New Star Media. Back when her family lost everything in the 2008 crash, I'd helped her get back on her feet and convinced Edward to give her a shot at the firm.  
  
She practically sprinted across the marble lobby when she saw me.  
  
""Savannah!"" She pulled me into a hug before whisking me toward the private elevator. ""You need to visit more often! The whole office lights up when you're here. Even Edward's death glare takes a vacation.""  
  
I couldn't help but smile. ""Everything okay around here lately?""  
  
""Better than okay - huge news!""  
  
""What?"" My stomach dropped.  
  
""We doubled our profits! Everyone's getting massive bonuses!"" Sarah's whole face lit up. That's what I've always loved about her - life knocked her down hard, but she never lost that sparkle.  
  
Edward was stuck in meetings, so Sarah walked me to his corner office. As we passed the executive floor, I noticed a cluster of unfamiliar faces - all young, female, and looking like they'd stepped off a magazine cover.  
  
A nasty little thought crept in: Was this why he'd suddenly started caring about evening grooming?  
  
I immediately felt sick at myself. This was Edward Reed, for God's sake. The same man who'd hosted the Miss Manhattan pageant at our venue and spent the whole evening answering work emails in his office.  
  
""You okay? You've got that look,"" Sarah nudged me.  
  
I bit my lip. ""New assistants?""  
  
""What? Oh - the PR team. Business is booming, so Edward set up a dedicated external relations department. His idea, actually - said it was the only way to keep his promise about being home for dinner every night.""  
  
She gave me that knowing look. ""Savannah, you were literally on Vanity Fair's '30 Under 30' list. Are you seriously worried about the PR girls?""  
  
""I know, I know, I'm being ridiculous,"" I laughed weakly.  
  
Sarah squeezed my arm. ""Your overthinking is going to give you premature wrinkles. Relax - they handle client events. Edward barely knows their names.""  
  
After she left, I sank into Edward's chair, staring at the gallery of our photos on his desk. Photos from our vineyard wedding, our Amalfi Coast anniversary, casual shots of me laughing in Central Park...  
  
So the company was thriving. No other woman. Maybe he just got a fancy new electric razor from his Birchbox. Maybe he just felt like it.  
  
Riley and Sarah kept telling me if I hadn't married someone as steady as Edward, my anxiety would've landed me in therapy years ago.  
  
Then came a soft knock.  
  
A woman entered, head slightly bowed, setting down a cup of artisan tea with picture-perfect precision.  
  
""Mrs. Reed, please don't hesitate if you need anything else.""  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
Claire Morrison. Edward's executive assistant.  
  
I hadn't expected to see her.  
  
She was still here.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
SAVANNAH  
  
A few years ago, Edward came home looking like he'd seen a ghost. I knew something was wrong the moment he walked through our apartment door.  
  
He sat on our Italian leather sofa for what felt like hours before he finally spoke. He'd run into the family of the drunk driver who killed his parents.  
  
The accident happened when Edward was at NYU. His parents were stopped at a red light on the Mass Pike when a drunk driver plowed into them at full speed. All three died instantly.  
  
Claire Morrison was that driver's daughter.  
  
Edward had discovered this three months after his HR team hired her as his executive assistant.  
  
I'd never seen him so shaken - his hands trembling, eyes bloodshot. ""Savi, I can't... every time I see her, all I can think about is that night. Sometimes I just want to..."" His voice cracked. This was Edward Reed - the man who could make or break companies without blinking - completely undone.  
  
I pulled him close, running my fingers through his hair. ""Hey, it's okay. You don't have to handle this alone. You can have HR transfer her, give her a great recommendation.""  
  
That was the first time I'd ever seen the ruthless CEO of New Star Media break down like a lost child, holding onto me like I was his anchor to reality.  
  
When I carefully broached the subject a few weeks later, he seemed back to his usual composed self.  
  
""I had her moved to Operations on a different floor.""  
  
""Why keep her at all? Are you sure you're okay with this?""  
  
His expression was surprisingly peaceful. ""You were right - I can't let the past control me forever. Maybe this is my chance to grow beyond it. I'm fine, really.""  
  
After that, during my occasional office visits, Claire vanished from sight. Edward never mentioned her again. I thought he'd finally found his peace with it.  
  
Until today, when she walked into his corner office.  
  
""I recall Melissa was Edward's assistant?""  
  
Claire gave that nervous smile she'd perfected. ""She's on maternity leave. A few of us from Operations are rotating coverage.""  
  
""That must be quite the adjustment,"" I said diplomatically.  
  
Claire wasn't exactly Manhattan executive material. Small-boned, almost delicate, with plain features and off-the-rack clothes. She had this permanent deer-in-headlights look - like someone who spent their life trying not to be noticed.  
  
She dipped her head slightly. ""Mrs. Reed, I should get back to the front desk.""  
  
As she turned, I caught sight of something on her neck - several distinctive red marks.  
  
Unmistakably hickeys.  
  
Edward returned from his board meeting looking every inch the power player in his bespoke Tom Ford suit.  
  
He leaned against the doorframe of his office, just watching me with that smile that still made my heart skip. ""Finally decided to grace New Star Media with your presence?""  
  
I walked over and slipped into his arms. ""Maybe I should visit more often. Your entire staff lights up when I'm here.""  
  
He tweaked my nose playfully. ""They better not light up too much.""  
  
I chose my next words carefully. ""Claire brought me coffee earlier.""  
  
He stilled for a moment before managing a quiet ""Mm.""  
  
""She's filling in as your assistant. Edward, you don't have to explain - I know you've worked through this.""  
  
I looked up at him. ""Mom always said you had incredible resilience. Look at you now - running this empire, handling everything so perfectly. She knew exactly what you'd become.""  
  
His dark eyes held mine for a long moment before he bent to brush his lips against my forehead.  
  
""Savi,"" he murmured against my skin, ""that's all because of you.""

* Integrates LinkedIn, Indeed, and local job boards
* Rule-based matching with market-specific logic
* Processes in real-time

Built this in 9 weeks after three failed attempts. Sometimes you need to stop being clever and start being useful.

The boring approach won.

  
**EDIT:** About the JSON/workflow - I spent 10 days straight building this after multiple failed attempts. The core matching logic is proprietary (it's what makes this actually work compared to other tools), but the basic flow is:

1. CV parsing ‚Üí Extract skills, experience, location preferences
2. Job aggregation ‚Üí Pull from LinkedIn/Indeed APIs
3. Custom matching rules ‚Üí This is the secret sauce
4. Scoring & filtering ‚Üí Remove irrelevant matches
5. Output with explanations

I'm planning to offer this as a service since recruiters are already using it successfully. If you're interested in:

* Using the tool for your recruiting needs
* Custom implementation for your company
* Building something similar with my help

Feel free to DM me. Happy to discuss consulting options or usage pricing.

The 10 days of no sleep should at least buy me a few coffees, right?

But seriously, I learned a ton building this and I'm open to helping others tackle similar matching problems. Just know that the real work isn't in the code - it's in understanding how recruiters actually think.",0,1749870724.0,n8n,3,0.5,False

Chapter 1  
  
It was pouring rain when my billionaire husband was driving our son to his SATs and suddenly dumped him on the side of the road to rush to the hospital.  
  
All because his secretary was pregnant.  
  
My son couldn't catch a ride in the storm, so he ran through the rain trying to get to his test. He got hit by a truck and died.  
  
By the time I got the call and rushed to the hospital, my boy was already gone.  
  
While I was falling apart, sobbing over my dead child, my husband Grayson Montgomery called:  
  
""Hey babe, can you apologize to Mason for me? Lindsay's pregnant and I had to get here fast.""  
  
""I was hammered that night, but the kid's mine so I gotta step up.""  
  
""You've always wanted a daughter, right? When she's born, you can raise her.""  
  
When I didn't respond, he added: ""The girl's young and doesn't know shit about being a mom. I need to stick around and help her out.""  
  
I wiped my tears and said flatly: ""Fine.""  
  
After handling my son's funeral arrangements, I drafted divorce papers and made a phone call:  
  
""You've been wanting to DESTORY the Montgomery family? I'm not stopping you anymore.""  
  
...  
  
The voice on the other end burst into disbelief:  
  
""Vivian Sterling, cut the crap. I'm the damn Grim Reaper of Manhattan's elite circle‚Äîyou can't fool me. You've been pulling strings for the Montgomery family for twenty years. There's no way in hell you'd just walk away now.""  
  
My voice stayed steady. ""Grayson and I are getting divorced.""  
  
Dead silence, then he practically exploded:  
  
""Are you screwing with me right now?""  
  
""Back in the day, every blue-blood family in Manhattan was dying to marry you. You turned them all down and slummed it with the Montgomerys‚Äîa nobody third-tier family. Then you turned that loser Grayson into the richest guy in the state. And now you're ready to divorce his ass?""  
  
I didn't bother explaining. ""Look, the why doesn't matter. Bottom line‚ÄîI'm done cleaning up the Montgomery family's messes.""  
  
His laugh was pure satisfaction. ""Finally! That's all I wanted to hear. All these years, that cocky little shit Grayson actually thought he had skills. If you hadn't been covering his ass, I would've destroyed him ages ago.""  
  
""Since you're dumping him, guess what? Tomorrow at Montgomery Corp's anniversary gala, I'm gonna give him a real special present.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Just as I hung up, Grayson walked through the door‚Äîfirst time I'd seen him in three days.  
  
He headed straight for our son's room. Finding it empty, he turned to me on the couch:  
  
""Where's my boy?""  
  
""I get it, he wants to blow off steam after finals, but staying out this late? That's not happening. My son doesn't get to run wild.""  
  
I glanced at the fresh hickeys on Grayson's neck. ""Oh, so now you remember you have a son?""  
  
His face darkened, ready to snap at me.  
  
Then something clicked, and his tone softened: ""Is he still pissed about me ditching him the other day?""  
  
""When he gets back, I'll make it right. He's always been daddy's boy‚Äîhe won't stay mad.""  
  
Yeah, daddy's boy alright.  
  
Knowing how much Grayson cared about grades, Mason studied until dawn every night, aced every single test, graduated valedictorian.  
  
The night before his SATs, he was so pumped, swearing he'd get into Harvard or Yale, make his dad proud.  
  
And the man he worshipped most in the world got him killed on the most important day of his life.  
  
I can't even imagine how crushed our son felt when Grayson kicked him out of that car.  
  
Fighting back tears, my voice cracked: ""You'll NEVER see him again.""  
  
Grayson's face flushed with anger. ""Jesus, you're supposed to be his mother. Stop being so damn dramatic.""  
  
He tossed an expensive jewelry box at me like I was some charity case:  
  
""The girl's pregnant and clingy‚Äîshe needs me around.""  
  
""From now on, I'm only coming home one day a week. Be cool about it, yeah?""  
  
Kills our son and doesn't give a damn, spends all his time playing house with his knocked-up mistress, and I'm supposed to ""be cool""?  
  
Looking into those arrogant eyes, I honestly couldn't figure out how I'd wasted twenty years loving this piece of shit.  
  
I slid the divorce papers I'd prepared across the coffee table:  
  
""Sign these. Then you can babysit your pregnant side piece full-time.""  
  
Seeing me actually initiate divorce, Grayson's face twisted with contempt:  
  
""Damn, I spoiled you too good all these years. Now you don't know your place. Without me, you and your whole family would be living on the streets.""  
  
Watching Grayson's smug-ass attitude, I almost laughed.  
  
He really believed the Montgomery empire was his doing.  
  
Thought I was just some dependent housewife.  
  
I didn't waste my breath explaining. ""This marriage is over.""  
  
Seeing my resolve, Grayson lost it: ""What the hell's gotten into you? You know damn well our son would never agree to us splitting up.""  
  
""You want a divorce? Fine. But Mason's gotta tell me himself.""  
  
With that, Grayson stormed off and slammed the bedroom door.  
  
Usually when Grayson threw his tantrums, I'd smooth things over, keep the peace.  
  
Not this time. I signed the divorce papers quickly and walked out for good.  
  
The next day, I picked up my son's ashes from the funeral home, planning to take him back to the Sterling family plot in Manhattan.  
  
Then Grayson called:  
  
""Look, throw your little tantrum if you want, but don't drag my son into it by keeping him out all night. Today's Montgomery Corp's thirtieth anniversary gala. I'm announcing him as my heir. Get his ass over here now.""  
  
I stared at my son's urn, my voice hollow:  
  
""Fine. I'll bring him right over.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I first met Grayson back in college.  
  
Found him on the rooftop getting his ass kicked by a bunch of Manhattan trust fund brats.  
  
Even with blood streaming down his face, he gritted his teeth and refused to beg for mercy.  
  
Had to respect that kind of backbone.  
  
So I walked over and shot those guys a look.  
  
The second they saw me, those fearless rich boys went white as sheets and bolted like their asses were on fire.  
  
As they scrambled away, Grayson turned to look at me.  
  
He struggled to his feet, wincing as he warned me: ""Those guys are bad news. You shouldn't come up to the roof alone‚Äîdon't want them targeting you next.""  
  
Seeing him beaten to hell but still worried about a stranger made me smile: ""Trust me, they won't mess with me.""  
  
Grayson took in my plain clothes and thrift store vibe, then snorted: ""Come on, don't kid yourself. Those are Manhattan elite‚Äîtheir families run this city. Why would they be scared of some regular girl?""  
  
""Look, I don't judge people for being ordinary, but you don't need to make stuff up to impress me.""  
  
His assumption was pretty amusing, so I didn't bother correcting him.  
  
Later I learned his story‚Äîthird-tier family money, nearly bankrupt, his dad jumped off a building to escape the debt collectors.  
  
Grayson had clawed his way into Columbia on pure merit, determined to rebuild his family's legacy.  
  
Maybe it was because I was so used to spoiled trust fund babies who'd never worked a day in their lives.  
  
But his drive and determination really got to me.  
  
We started talking more and more.  
  
The deeper I got to know him, the more I saw how thoughtful he could be.  
  
When cramps had me doubled over in cold sweats, he'd show up with homemade ginger tea.  
  
When I was down, he'd go crazy trying to make me laugh again.  
  
During sudden downpours, he'd wrap his jacket around me and carry me through the flooding streets.  
  
Gradually, I fell for that genuine, pure-hearted version of him.  
  
He'd always blush and say he just wanted to take care of me.  
  
So we dated, got married, had our son.  
  
Knowing how proud he was, I helped him behind the scenes.  
  
With my support, he resurrected the dying Montgomery Corporation and became the wealthiest man in the state.  
  
But success changed him‚Äîsuddenly he was never home.  
  
When I asked him to spend more time with our son, the man who'd promised never to look down on ordinary people sneered at me:  
  
""What the hell does a housewife know? Men are supposed to make money‚ÄîI don't have time to waste playing house. Without me busting my ass out there, you think you and the kid would have this cushy lifestyle?""  
  
His transformation left me heartbroken and disappointed.  
  
But I stayed grateful to him.  
  
He'd given me good genes‚Äîblessed me with a brilliant, amazing son.  
  
I just wanted to focus on raising Mason right.  
  
So I put up with Grayson's crap, made excuse after excuse for him.  
  
Never imagined that all my patience would lead to him knocking up his secretary behind my back.  
  
And getting our son killed because of it.  
  
Losing my boy killed any attachment I had left to this family.  
  
And my love for Grayson?  
  
Stone cold dead.

So like a lot of people in this thread I used to genuinely enjoy going to the airport and getting drunk before the flight, have another couple while flying and then passing out until I landed.

Last year I broke one of my sobriety stints at the airport for this very reason.

Drinking made time at the airport go fast and it also made me forget my fear of flying which has only worsened with all the accidents in the media lately.

So this Monday I had a flight at noon  to LA to catch. I haven‚Äôt drank since Dec 31st and have not been extremely tempted since. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve had time where I‚Äôd like to drink like it would be fun but I haven‚Äôt genuinely considered. 

That changed on Sunday the night before my flight. I started telling myself that having a couple drinks before the flight might be OK because I am deathly afraid of flying and I was also flying from Newark New Jersey, which has been in the news quite a lot lately for its lack of safety. On top of the I had lounge access thanks to my credit card and access to feee unlimited alcohol. I genuinely thought thought this might be the end to my abstinence like it all made sense in my head. 1) im genuinely afraid of flying 
2) I‚Äôm flying out of Newark airport which literally been in the news as a safety risk and has had employees warn against flying there 
3) I have access to the lounge and free drinks 

By the grace of God by the time the morning rolls around, I started having doubts about drinking. There was something inside me that told me if I drink it would probably ruin my vacation because I would feel really guilty about breaking almost 6 months of abstinence. Despite this feeling, I decided to get to the airport 2 1/2 hours early in case I did want to drink I could have a good amount of time to do so. I decided I would just decide once I got to the airport. once I get to the airport it‚Äôs really cloudy which makes me even more nervous to fly so I start thinking. Maybe I will have a couple glasses of wine. 

And then once I got into the lounge, I sort of teeter taught her back-and-forth for a while about whether I should go to the bar, but you know what stopped me? There were barely any people at the bar there is maybe like five or six people drinking and the lounge was full. I realize that it‚Äôs really not normal to be drinking so early in the morning and that it‚Äôs not necessarily a desirable thing to do‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt know there was no clear aha moment but time just started trickling on and I just ended up passing the time, eating a bunch of food and drinking coffee Working on some things and before I knew it it was time to get on my plane and I hadnt drank.

Fast forward to a few days later when I have to leave for my flight back - the day my flight leaves on a redeye there‚Äôs news about the crash in India. I freak out. My flight anxiety shoots through the roof. 
I get to the airport longe this time it‚Äôs later in the evening so a ton of people are drinking at the lounge. I decide maybe I‚Äôll have one later. I never do I end up eating and drinking two teas. I get On my flight freaking out and picturing my plane colliding with another plane once I land in Newark. The plane takes off without incident‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm still freaking out internally so I decide to buy a wine from the flight attendant just in case things get bad on the plane‚Ä¶ About an hour later we start encountering turbulence it‚Äôs not crazy turbulence but my fear pf flying combined with what I‚Äôve been seeing about air India, flying back into sketchy ass Newark  I‚Äôm literally trembling at every bump. I keep staring at the wine but I decide if this is it at this point one can of wine won‚Äôt help me. So I don‚Äôt drink it. I white knuckle the rest of the flight and we land without incident.

When I tell you, that was probably most trying time I‚Äôve had by far of braking my abstinence. and to be perfectly honest, I don‚Äôt think I want to get back on a plane unless I have Xanax because it was too much. But I‚Äôm really glad that I did not drink. I didn‚Äôt want this to be the beginning of another who knows how many months of binge drinking on and off. It was really hard but worth it. 



TDLR: I had every excuse to drink at the airport. Fear of flying, free alcohol, turbulence, flying into Newark airport but I didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm so grateful.

It was amazing. Unfortunately, I am worried vanilla dating will not cut it anymore. Sugar dating has changed my life perspective. It has brought a new level of confidence, love, and femininity. It‚Äôs quite strange that this is considered taboo when I feel it‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what did it but ultimately I think the more I poured into myself and let others(my SD) pour into me‚Ä¶the more my life just seemed to get better.

Definitely hang in there. It took me about two months to get to this point. About a month of meet and greets and a month to intimacy. I will say one cardinal rule for me is no matter how good the money is. I do not accept the arrangement until I like them as a person. (Usually figure this out after one coffee date, which I do not accept money for but I do get the transportation paid for)

Also the treatment from a real SD is very obvious (they actually love the essence of what it is to be a woman) and you‚Äôll realize it is the real deal. Who knows, it might sour down the road but I take comfort knowing I‚Äôve changed for the better.

(please have your own money, you should be able to walk away if your gut is telling you No. Its a waste of time for you and the SD to fight against your instincts)

(I will not promote),"Recently I came across the news that Omegle was shut down. And as someone who used it previously (not that I was a big fan of it) I started thinking why people would have used it. I recently moved abroad for higher education and as an introvert it has been difficult making friends that are local. As someone who prefers to text and someone working on keeping a conversation going, I realized I needed help with it. I would much rather talk to another real person than an AI chatbot. So I got thinking, maybe a one to one messaging app that connects you with a random person in the same city/ local area every week with the goal of getting to know each other and making friends. The app's primary audience is introverts that struggle to make or keep a conversation going just like me. And to help them the app would feature an AI assistant that would read the last few messages with the other person and suggests follow-ups for the user to type to keep the chat going. The app could also feature a ""third-place finder"" that helps the user find places to meet in-person. The recommendation is based on the messages. Example: if the user says ""would like to have a coffee together and talk more"" and if the other person agrees, a box on the chat window appears showing nearby coffee shops.

Hopefully the idea comes across well. What do you guys think? Is this a tarpit idea or a problem you have faced or know someone who faces it? This is not a promotion and I will not promote. ",0,1749870055.0,startups,1,0.5,False

I‚Äôve had the Aiden since shortly after its initial release. Unlike many users, my experience with the hardware and software has been trouble-free.

However, I‚Äôve encountered difficulty with the dialling-in process. I‚Äôve been struggling to make a satisfactory cup of coffee.

Before the Aiden, we used a Moccamaster, and we genuinely loved that machine. I found dialling in relatively straightforward: adjust the grind size to ensure the brew time falls within a certain range, and it consistently produces solid results. 

We currently use a Fellow Ode Gen 2 for grinding

We‚Äôre considering moving back to the Moccamaster. Before making a decision, I wanted to reach out to the subreddit for advice. 

I‚Äôm generally a light-roast guy, local roaster kind of guy‚Ä¶ for anyone in the GTA, Subtext is my go-to for great quality beans.

For our morning brew, my wife and I like to make 4-5 cups-worth of coffee‚Ä¶ we did that with the Moccamaster and have continued to do so with the Aiden. 

Because of the volume of coffee we go through, we tend to buy less artisanal coffee from time-to-time to keep costs down, but still brew a lot of Subtext or other premium roasts through the Aiden. 

At the moment, we have a few bags of cheaper beans from Costco.. medium roast, non-oily  beans by Level Ground. One bag of Peruvian and one bag of Andes. 

I‚Äôm hoping for some recipe / grind setting suggestions to have one more kick at the can while we have these two massive bags of so-so beans to see if we can produce something for our morning batch brew that rivals what we could get with the Moccamaster. 

Any dialling-in tips about brew-time or drawdown for batch brews would also be greatly appreciated. I have no issues with spending time working out a technique‚Ä¶

Final thing to mention is that I almost never use the Aiden to produce a single cup‚Ä¶ I prefer my kettle and V60 for that‚Ä¶ and can make a cup just as fast, if not faster, than I can with the Aiden. 

Maybe that‚Äôs my problem? The Aiden just isn‚Äôt a best-in-class batch brewer? 

Thanks in advance to anyone taking the time to reply. ",1,1749869970.0,FellowProducts,2,1.0,False

1laycvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1laycvb/guide_for_breaking_into_investment_banking/,Guide for Breaking into Investment Banking,"Hi all,

This post is intended to provide a thorough breakdown on the best pathways into Investment Banking for:

1. Undergraduate/Graduate students (Bachelor and masters students)
2. Working professionals within commerce ( Big4 accounting firms, Big4 banks, etc)

I have made a post below which summarises my experience in IBD (main duties, pros and cons) as well as a detailed comments section for questions.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1l6wn51/the\_australian\_investment\_banking\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1l6wn51/the_australian_investment_banking_experience/)

\-----

**The 3 main areas of Investment banking are:**

1. Investment Banking Division (IBD) - M&A / Equity Capital Markets / Debt Capital Markets / Restructuring / Leveraged Finance
2. Equity Research
3. Institutional Sales & Trading

This post will be focused on IBD as this is my area of expertise. Equity Research is unique as there is a strong emphasis to hire Industry professionals (without finance backgrounds) in their field. E.g. hiring doctors as healthcare analysts, hiring engineers for technology analysts. Sell side equity research is also a dying industry and there are limited seats. Sales & Trading is also a niche and the market in Australia is small with very few seats.

\-----

**Australia's Investment Banking Landscape**

**1. International Big Dogs**¬†\- Goldman/JPM/UBS/MorganS/RBC/Citi/Barclays/BOFA/Jefferies

\- Nothing needs to be said here. Get worked like a dog but sets up your life.

2.¬†**International Elite Boutiques -**¬†Moelis Australia/ Lazard/ Houlihan/ Greenhill/ Rothschild, etc

\- weaker presence in Australia - strong brand name

3.¬†**Boutique Banks (Independent Strategic M&A Advisors)**¬†\- Flagstaff Partners/Grant Samuel/Gresham/Highbury Partnership/Canterbury Partners/ Luminis Partners/ Allier Capital/ Azure Capital/Record Point etc.

\- Mostly Sydney based, strong brand names, great experience, senior guys are usually ex rainmakers of international big dog banks.

**4\*\*. ANZ Big 3**¬†\-\*\* Macquarie / Barrenjoey/ Jarden

\- Rivals the big dogs - close to zero international presence (Macq has small infra presence globally, Barrenjoey strategic partnership with Barclays)

**5\*\*. Stockbrokers/wealth advisory firm**s\*\* - Canaccord Genuity/ Bell Potter/ Morgans/ E&P/ Ord Minnett /Wilsons

\- Plays in the small-mid cap space. No M&A capability - small equity capital market teams.

\-----

**Action items (in-order of importance)**

**1. Networking**

\- Reach out to Analyst/Associates via email/Linkedin to set up calls/coffee chats with the goal of learning more about what they do/their experiences on the job and the bank.

\- Helps to get interviews and extremely useful during interviews/superday if you can say "" after speaking with person x, some of the main takeaways are y and z.... as a result, i think this makes me a great fit cos of ........""

\- Puts your CV to the top of the list and is great to build rapport. Senior decision makers look to the analyst/associates when it comes to junior hiring (ft and internships)

**2. Interview Preparation**¬†( broken down into Technical/behavioural/real-life case studies)

A) Behavioural - Ensure strong answers for these below:

\- Why Investment banking?

\- Why this particular bank and group?

\- What are you strengths and weaknesses?

\- Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?

\* Setting up calls with analysts at the bank to get their experiences is key here.

B) Technical

\- Run me through the 3 main valuation methodologies (DCF/Trading comps/ Transaction comps)

\- Pitch me a stock/talk about personal investing journey ( 100% asked if investing and stock picking is under hobbies)

\- Understanding how the 3 financial statements tie together

\- General corporate finance understanding

C) Case studies/ past transactions

\- Study the bank's past transactions and other landmark deals (Street talk - AFR)

**3. Financial modelling courses**

**-**¬†Wall Street Prep investment banking course helps build technical skills and most importantly, financial modelling understanding.

\- Good to talk to during interviews

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Undergraduate/graduate students**

\- The degree is not overly important - Commerce/Business/Finance/Economics/Science/Maths/Law are all suitable.

\- Your number 1 goal is to secure a 8-10 week summer/winter analyst role (internship). International big dog banks DO NOT hire any graduates without such experience. Summer analyst roles are open at the moment - linkedin/company website - for boutique banks, send cold email via their contact on website. Network as much as you can.

\- internships at Big 4 accounting firms are also great (deal advisory/m&a/transaction services/ financial DD). Institutional/corporate banking, markets etc are excellent at big 4 banks.

At this stage, any internship is good as it helps set up the next thing - the 1st one is always the hardest to get. Follow action items 1-3. The goal is to do as much as you can, does not have to be from a tier 1 institution - say YES to every opportunity. Talk to as many industry professionals as you can.

Requirements

\- Go8 Uni, 75+ WAM minimum (top banks require 80+), strong co-curricular, leadership, previous relevant experience (this could be anything - just need to show you have tried to do something) and 95+ATAR (this absolutely matters - Can't really say I'm hard working, smart and eager to learn with shit ATAR).

\*I've seen alot of people comment in previous posts about requiring 85-90+ WAM to be competitive. This is simply untrue. Its about becoming a well-rounded candidate that can come across as a genuine person during the interviews. Investment banking is not about who can crunch the numbers the best - if i'm going to work 80+ hrs a week with someone, I better enjoy working with that person"". For reference, I've secured interviews at Goldman/MBB consulting /Macquarie/ top hedge funds with \~78ish WAM.

\---------

**1. Working Professionals within Commerce/Law**

Big 4 Accounting firms ( Deal advisory/ Transaction services/ M&A/ Financial DD) are gateways into IB. Very common for people to do 1.5-3 years and make the transition to IBD.

If you are in another area of the Big 4, seek a internal transfer within these areas ( Email the directors to set up coffee chats with the goal to learn more about what they do - Important to show interest but DO NOT ASK FOR A JOB).

Big 4 Banks (Corporate/Institutional Banking/Markets) are also gateways into IB. Same strategy as above....

Big Law also natural transitions into IB.

T**he key takeaway: the background is important, but its not the most important aspect. I am taking someone with a good background, great interview, genuine person who showed initiative via networking over the smartest/brightest person. Most decision makers share this view.**

\--------

**Certifications**

1. MBA - pretty useless for breaking into IB
2. Masters - Opens up a 2nd window for internship recruitment. Does not guarantee a job - would say its not cost effective. Do not recommend
3. CFA - Best option for aspiring equity research analysts. A top MD once told me a CFA 3 guarantees a job at any wall st bank - I tend to agree with this. Valuable for IB - best option IMO.

**Conclusion**

From a numbers perspective, the reality is most people will not break into IB straight out of Uni, however there many routes post graduation to get in.

Hopefully this helps someone :)

If the argument is the distribution of the coffee beans with the conical part into the portafilter after the shake (so when you are transferring it from the blind shaker to the portafilter basket), can't we just print one out and use it inside and then just do the same motion, removing it instead from the blind shaker, from the robot's portafilter, this will be usually cheaper, but more importantly always less messier?",1,1749869767.0,CafelatRobot,2,0.67,False

I was standing outside the City Hall with my fianc√©,waiting in line to get our marriage license.

Out of nowhere,a little boy ran up,hugged my fianc√©‚Äôs leg and called him‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù

I thought it was someone doing pranks,but then my fianc√©smiled tenderly,scooped the kid up in his arms and said,‚ÄúI just found out,‚Äùhe said softly.‚ÄúWhen Lana and I broke up five years ago,she was already pregnant.She came back recently,a single mom with a kid.People will [talk.So](http://talk.So),I‚Äôll give them a proper status.‚Äù

Before I could say anything,Lana Pierce walked over.Micah Langston‚Äîmy fianc√©‚Äîinterlocked his fingers with hers,looking like the happiest man on earth.

I asked calmly,‚Äúwhat about us?‚Äù

Micah replied,‚ÄúI have to marry [Lana.As](http://Lana.As) for us‚Ä¶‚Äù

Lana cut in with a sugary smile.‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre already here,why don‚Äôt you take a photo and post it on your socials?That way your friends will think you still got married today.‚Äù

Then she actually pulled out her phone,pointed it at us and chirped,‚ÄúSay cheese!‚Äù

Micah tried to reassure me.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,Riley.I still love you.Lana‚Äôs like family.And the kid‚Ä¶I just feel bad for him.Growing up without a dad can really mess a kid up.I just want to be there for him.Let‚Äôs put our wedding on hold.When he‚Äôs older,we‚Äôll explain everything.I promise I‚Äôll give you the big wedding you deserve.‚Äù

And just like that,the three of them walked off hand-in-hand to get their marriage certificate.

I pulled out my phone and called Asher Lane‚Äîthe guy who‚Äôs been chasing me for ten years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside City Hall and in need of a marriage certificate.Want to be my husband?‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking me to marry you?You‚Äôre full of surprises,Miss Vaughn,‚Äùhe said,stunned.‚ÄúI literally just got off a flight.I‚Äôm out of the country right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mind then.‚Äù

But before I could hang up,his tone shifted‚Äîsuddenly urgent.‚ÄúWait!Don‚Äôt move.I‚Äôll be back before the place closes.Whoever bails is a chicken!‚Äù

After hanging up,I let out a long breath.Guess I‚Äôd better find somewhere to wait.

That‚Äôs when I heard someone call out sharply,‚ÄúRiley Vaughn!‚Äù

I turned [around.It](http://around.It) was Micah.He must‚Äôve already gotten their license.He had the kid in one arm and was holding Lana‚Äôs hand with the other.Picture-perfect little family.

He came up to me,looking irritated.‚ÄúWhy are you still here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for someone,‚ÄùI said honestly.‚ÄúTo get a marriage certificate with.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes.‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be sarcastic.I already told you‚ÄîI only just found out about the kid.Don‚Äôt you understand?‚Äù

I nodded.‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù

Micah stepped closer and lowered his voice.‚ÄúThen please,just go home.I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene in front of the child.‚Äù

I brushed his hand off my arm.‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious.I‚Äôm actually waiting for someone‚Äîto get married.‚Äù

His face darkened.‚ÄúRiley,this is your last warning.Keep acting like this and I swear,I‚Äôll start to really hate you.‚Äù

Lana stepped forward with a sweet,concerned look on her face.‚ÄúAre you upset because you didn‚Äôt get your marriage certificate,Riley?‚Äùshe asked gently.

She pulled hers from her bag and held it out.‚ÄúHere.Take a photo with mine.The covers are all the same‚Äîno one will know it‚Äôs not yours unless they open it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt take it.The booklet dropped to the ground.

Lana crouched down,her eyes glistening as she picked it up.Her voice trembling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.I shouldn‚Äôt have come back with the child.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Micah shot me a glare and said coldly,‚ÄúRiley,I didn‚Äôt know you were this petty.If you can‚Äôt accept Lana,then we‚Äôre done!‚Äù

I said,‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

My calm response caught him off guard.

Lana quickly leaned down and nudged the boy toward me.‚ÄúGo on,sweetheart.Say hi to this lady and tell her not to be upset.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äùthe boy shouted.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a bad woman!A homewrecker!‚Äù

Then,out of nowhere,he shoved me hard.‚ÄúYou steal my daddy!‚Äù

People started staring.Some even looked disgusted.I heard someone mutter,‚ÄúWow,side chicks are really bold these days‚Äîcoming to the courthouse to steal someone‚Äôs husband.‚Äù

I looked at the boy and said gently,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.Your dad and I broke up.He‚Äôs all yours now.I wish your parents a lifetime of happiness.‚Äù

Micah nodded in approval.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more like it.Keep being sensible like this.‚Äù

Then he walked off with Lana and the boy,like the perfect little family.

As I watched his back,I thought,‚ÄòThat wasn‚Äôt me being‚Äòsensible.‚ÄôI meant every word.‚Äô

I found a nearby caf√©and sat down to wait for Asher.

While I was sipping my coffee,a news alert popped up on my phone.

‚ÄúBreaking News:Lane Group‚Äôs representation walks out mid-signing at international contract ceremony.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat.

Lane Group‚Äôs representation?Could it be Asher?

I clicked the link and sure enough‚Äîa video popped up.

It showed a tall,handsome man walking away mid-meeting,phone to his ear.

It was indeed Asher.

I could even faintly hear him say,‚ÄúWhoever bails is a chicken.‚Äù

Then came a clip of a reporter interviewing the other party involved in the signing.‚ÄúMr.Lane left [midway.Do](http://midway.Do) you take that as a sign of disrespect?‚Äù

The man being interviewed,an older white gentleman,just shrugged and smiled.‚ÄúAll I can say is‚Äîlove comes first.I don‚Äôt feel disrespected at all.Actually,I admire Mr.Lane‚Äôs for [it.It](http://it.It) aligns perfectly with our values.We‚Äôll wait for him to come back.This won‚Äôt affect our partnership in any way.‚Äù

I put my phone down,feeling overwhelmed.

Asher Lane had chased me for ten years‚Äîalways putting me first,always loving me with everything he had.

But I was so caught up in Micah,I never gave him a real chance.

Now that I was done with Micah,I could finally see things clearly.

When I compared the two,it hit me‚ÄîAsher‚Äôs love was real.Micah‚Äôs was nothing but empty promises.

I opened my inbox and started reading through Asher‚Äôs old emails.

Every message was filled with warmth and sincerity.Back then I thought he was being clingy‚Ä¶now I realized they were love letters.

Letter after letter,full of love I never noticed.

My heart ached a [little.How](http://little.How) did he manage to keep loving me all those years?

I read them all and before I knew it,the sun was starting to set.

Then suddenly‚Äîa bouquet of flowers appeared in front of me.

I looked up and saw Asher,standing there with the biggest grin.

‚ÄúSorry I kept you waiting,wifey,‚Äùhe said.

That word caught me off [guard.It](http://guard.It) felt strange but‚Ä¶not weird.

Asher noticed my silence and looked a little nervous.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôve changed your mind?‚Äù

I smiled at him.‚ÄúRelax.I‚Äôm not a chicken.‚Äù

We walked back into the courthouse,side by side and got our license.

I knew there were still people waiting for him across the ocean,so I encouraged him to head back soon.

Chapter 3

Asher pulled me into a tight hug.‚ÄúWhen I get back,we‚Äôll have the wedding.And just so you know‚Äîwhoever backs out is a chicken.‚Äù

I watched him walk away,unable to stop a bitter smile from curling at my lips.This was the great Asher Lane‚Äîconfident,commanding,practically royalty in the business world.And yet,so insecure when it came to love?

It was already getting dark when I finally made my way home,cradling the bouquet of flowers he gave me.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was the scene waiting for me on the other side of the door.

Lana.And her son.

She was lounging on my couch,in my pajamas,casually watching TV.Her son,shoes on and all,was bouncing like a maniac on the designer couch I‚Äôd painstakingly chosen‚Äîleaving muddy footprints all over the upholstery.That couch cost over ten grand.

I felt rage rising in my chest,boiling over‚Äîbut before I could say a word,Micah walked out of the kitchen.

His brows furrowed in confusion.‚ÄúWhy are you back?‚Äù

I choked on my anger for a moment before I forced out a cold reply,‚ÄúPretty sure this is still my place.‚Äù

The boy suddenly chucked his toy at me.‚ÄúThis is my dad‚Äôs house.It‚Äôs our house.Get out!‚Äù

I was stunned.Lana,completely unfazed,just smiled sweetly and said,‚ÄúOh Riley,don‚Äôt mind [him.Kids](http://him.Kids) don‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

Then she walked over and,without asking,snatched the flowers from my hands.‚ÄúAre these for me and Micah?That‚Äôs so thoughtful of you.Thanks for the well wishes.‚Äù

I tried to take the bouquet back,but her son yanked it away.He threw it to the ground,stomped on it hard and spat,‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want your stupid flowers.Stop trying to suck up to my mom!‚Äù

I was so furious my head started to throb.‚ÄúYou better pay for that bouquet!‚Äù

Micah snapped,clearly annoyed.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a [kid.Gosh.How](http://kid.Gosh.How) can you stoop to his level?‚Äù

Then he did the unthinkable‚Äîhe handed me an apron.‚ÄúJust go cook dinner.Don‚Äôt provoke him.‚Äù

I let out a disbelieving laugh.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,am I your servant,now?How dare you telling me to cook?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you just stop being difficult?‚ÄùMicah scowled.‚ÄúEver since we left the City Hall,you‚Äôve been nothing but dramatic.‚Äù

He kept going,voice sharp.‚ÄúEverything was fine until you showed up and threw it all into chaos.I‚Äôm trying to help you here.Just cook something‚Äîas a gesture for Lana and her kid.‚Äù

I locked eyes with [him.My](http://him.My) voice was low and steady.‚ÄúYou really think I‚Äôm the one who ruined everything‚Äîthat I should apologize?‚Äù

His gaze wavered.

But then he sighed.‚ÄúLook,the kid‚Äôs innocent.You‚Äôre the adult here.Can‚Äôt you just take the high road for once?I know it‚Äôs uncomfortable,but I‚Äôll make it up to you,okay?‚Äù

Something inside me snapped.

‚ÄúWhy does it always have to be me who suffers?‚ÄùI asked softly.‚ÄúWas I not innocent too?‚Äù

His gaze wavered.

Before he could respond,the boy came out of nowhere with a dinner fork and jabbed it into my thigh.

‚ÄúGet out!You don‚Äôt belong here!‚Äùhe screamed.

I shoved him away,hard.‚ÄúThis house is mine.I paid for it.If anyone‚Äôs leaving,it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

He burst into tears and ran straight into Lana‚Äôs arms.

I had bought this house to start a life with Micah after we got married.But clearly,he‚Äôd forgotten that.Instead,he‚Äôd decided it would be just the perfect little love nest for him,another woman and her child.

Lana wiped at her fake tears,looking tragically heartbroken.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.We shouldn‚Äôt have come.We should probably leave now.‚Äù

But Micah stepped in immediately,stopping her.He looked genuinely upset.

Then he turned to me,anger flaring in his eyes.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already dark out.Where can she go with a kid at this hour?Can‚Äôt you show a little compassion?‚Äù

I let out a heavy sigh.‚ÄúFine.But they‚Äôre gone by morning‚Äîor I‚Äôm calling the cops.‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs jaw clenched.‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre really going to throw them out‚Ä¶then I‚Äôll leave too.‚Äù

Chapter 4

I let out a hollow laugh.‚ÄúPlease do.‚Äù

I opened the bedroom door,just wanting to crash and forget this nightmare.

But the moment I walked in,I stopped cold.

The bedsheets were crumpled.The blanket had been used.And under my pillow,there it was‚Äîwomen‚Äôs underwear.Not mine.

A wave of nausea hit me.

Lana had already slept in my bed?

I grabbed my essentials,didn‚Äôt even glance at the people in the living room and stormed out.

I slammed the door behind me.Hard.

I‚Äôd stay at a hotel tonight.That place felt dirty now.Tomorrow,I‚Äôd bring in a cleaning crew.Maybe even throw out the bed.

The day had drained every ounce of energy out of me.After washing up at the hotel,I collapsed on the bed‚Äîonly for my phone to buzz.

A friend request.

I accepted without thinking.

Then came the photos.

Every single one showed Micah and Lana,in my house,tangled up in each other on what was supposed to be our marital bed.

The last image came with a message.\[Smart women know when to quit.\]

I replied:\[And some are into leftovers.I‚Äôm more than happy to hand him over.\]

Then I turned off my phone and went to sleep.

When I woke,the sun was already up.I ate breakfast,then went back to my house to reclaim what was mine.But when I opened the front door,I froze again.

Balloons.Streamers.Posters on the walls.

Micah and Lana‚Äôs wedding photos,everywhere.

Strangers‚Äîpeople I didn‚Äôt recognize‚Äîwere lounging on my couch,raiding my fridge,drinking from my mugs.

My bookshelf had been ransacked.Files scattered everywhere.The antique ornaments I‚Äôd bought at auctions and the heirloom gifts from my parents‚Äîmanhandled and some already shattered.

I forced myself to stay calm and turned off their loud music.

They all turned to look at me,annoyed.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚ÄùI asked coldly.‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my house?‚Äù

They exchanged confused glances.‚ÄúYour house?You mean Lana‚Äôs house?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here for the wedding.Who the hell are you?‚Äùthe other added.

I almost choked on my own fury.‚ÄúMicah and Lana‚Ä¶are holding a wedding here?!‚Äù

Then someone pointed at me.‚ÄúI know her.Guys,she‚Äôs that mistress!‚Äù

Before I could say anything,someone flung a cup of milk tea in my face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some nerve showing up here.Trying to ruin the wedding,you homewrecker?‚Äù

More people joined in‚Äîslapping,kicking,screaming at me.

I fought back,but there were too many.

I was shoved to the ground.

They got braver,crueler.

Someone hit me.Someone tried to rip my clothes.Others livestreamed the whole thing,wanting the whole internet to‚Äúsee what a mistress looks like.‚Äù

I covered my face,but they grabbed my hands and yanked them away.

They pinned my limbs down and hung a pair of heels around my neck.Then they spat in my face,mocking me,calling me cheap,shameless and other names.

I sobbed,helpless and humiliated,as they used my pain for entertainment.

Until suddenly‚Äîsomeone shouted,‚ÄúThe groom‚Äôs here!‚Äù

They backed off and rushed to the door.

I scrambled to my feet,barely able to stand.

And there they were‚ÄîMicah in a sharp suit,Lana in a wedding gown.

Micah saw me,disheveled and broken.He hesitated,then walked over.

Leaning in,he whispered,‚ÄúI thought you left.This is not a real wedding.We‚Äôre just putting on a show‚Ä¶for the kid.‚Äù

Chapter 5

My voice was cold.‚ÄúOh,I [see.So](http://see.So) the bruises on my face and the shattered antiques‚Äîthose are all just props for your little show?‚Äù

Micah frowned,clearly not happy with my reaction.

Before he could say anything,their friends swarmed around us.

‚ÄúMicah,this mistress has some nerve showing up here like this,‚Äùone of them sneered.‚ÄúYou should slap her‚Äîmake it up to Lana.‚Äù

Micah didn‚Äôt move.

But Lana was staring at him expectantly.

Micah turned to me instead.‚ÄúJust leave,okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I?‚ÄùI asked coldly.‚ÄúAnd mistress?Tell me,Micah‚Äîam I a mistress?‚Äù

Someone nearby scoffed and spat at the ground near my feet.‚ÄúMicah has a wife and kid.What else would that make you?‚Äù

I stared at Micah with fire in my eyes.‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs voice was low.‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Gasps rippled through the crowd.Chaos erupted as everyone started shouting in Lana‚Äôs defense.

Micah tried to calm them down.‚ÄúNo,it‚Äôs not what you think,guys.She and I‚Ä¶we‚Äôre just friends.She‚Äôs not a mistress.We barely even know each other.‚Äù

I let out a disbelieving laugh.‚ÄúNot even friends?Really,Micah?Then tell me‚Äîwhy are you holding your wedding in my house?‚Äù

Someone near me kicked my leg.‚ÄúYour house?This is Micah and Lana‚Äôs home,you delusional gold digger.‚Äù

‚ÄúTypical homewrecker.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople like her should be paraded through the streets.‚Äù

They hurled insults like it was a sport.

I pulled out my phone and started dialing the police.

But Micah lunged forward,yanked it from my hand and hung up.

‚ÄúRiley,‚Äùhe said in a low voice.‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶let today happen,okay?After this,you can do whatever the hell you want‚Äù

I opened my mouth to argue‚Äîbut then a voice I recognized cut in.

‚ÄúJust listen,Riley.Don‚Äôt make a [scene.It](http://scene.It) won‚Äôt help you.‚Äù

I turned around and froze.

It was Micah‚Äôs mother.

She used to treat me like her own daughter‚Äîalways warm,always kind.She once told Micah that if he ever dared mistreat me,she‚Äôd be the first to object.

Yet here she was,attending his wedding‚Ä¶to another woman.

She dragged me into the bathroom,locked the door and said,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,honey.I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre treated fairly.Micah didn‚Äôt even know you when Lana got pregnant.Technically,it‚Äôs not cheating.Let them get married.Then they can get divorced.Better to be with a divorced dad than a man with an illegitimate child,right?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.‚ÄúDo you think I still want to be with Micah?Mrs.Langston,he‚Äôs free to marry whoever he wants‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt care less.But this is my house.I‚Äôm only asking him to leave.And of course,he‚Äôll be paying for all the damage done here today.‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs mom froze.

She stared at me like she didn‚Äôt recognize me anymore.‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you love Micah?‚Äùshe asked,still in disbelief.‚ÄúYou were willing to do anything for him.I remember you standing outside my door for three hours after he broke up with you.‚Äù

Chapter 6

‚ÄúRiley,Micah only married Lana to give her status.It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll really be together.Why are you blowing this out of proportion?‚Äùshe sounded impatient.

Hearing her dig up the past twisted something deep inside me.

Hearing her bring up the past made something twist in my chest.

God,I‚Äôd been so blind.

I was the one with money,the one from a good family‚Äîand yet I bent over backwards for Micah,terrified of upsetting him.I gave everything and asked for nothing.

Micah had me all figured out.The more I gave,the more he took.

He made me feel small,worthless‚Äîalways threatening to leave me if I didn‚Äôt play by his rules.And stupid me,I played right into his hands.I clung to him harder.

That‚Äôs probably why he had the nerve to marry Lana right under my nose.

He must‚Äôve thought I was fully‚Äòtamed.‚Äô

I‚Äôd never been in love before [him.So](http://him.So) I thought loving someone meant putting their happiness above everything.

But what I never realized‚Äîuntil now‚Äîis that real love isn‚Äôt about losing yourself.It‚Äôs about being happy,too.

With that thought,I turned to Micah‚Äôs mom and smiled politely.‚ÄúThat was then.This is now.And if I don‚Äôt get a satisfaction answers,I‚Äôm calling the cops on everyone.‚Äù

I opened the door and stepped out.

Behind me,Micah‚Äôs mom snapped,‚ÄúRiley,you better think this through.Everyone here saw you playing the homewrecker today.Whether it‚Äôs true or not,your reputation‚Äôs shot.And when that happens,we won‚Äôt agree to it even if you fall to your knees and cry blood begging to get back together and marry Micah.‚Äù

I spun around and shot back,‚ÄúOh,don‚Äôt worry about that.I‚Äôm already married.‚Äù

I bent down to pick up my phone from the ground,ready to call the cops.

But Micah grabbed my wrist.

He looked at me coldly and said,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really determined to ruin my wedding with Lana,aren‚Äôt you?Fine then.I won‚Äôt protect you anymore.‚Äù

He shoved me hard and I fell to the ground.Then he turned to the onlookers and said loudly,‚ÄúDrag her into the guest room.Don‚Äôt let her cause any more trouble.‚Äù

In an instant,seven or eight men surrounded me.Their faces lit up with excitement as they dragged me toward the guest room.

We hadn‚Äôt even made it inside when their hands started wandering.If they managed to get me through that door,I knew exactly what would happen.

I fought back with everything I had,but I was no match for them.

And then the front door slammed open.

A man‚Äôs furious voice echoed through the room.‚ÄúTouch my wife and you‚Äôre dead!‚Äù

Tears immediately streamed down my face.

Asher had arrived.

Chapter 1

The first time my billionaire husband was drugged,I rushed over in a panic,only to run into a trembling female university student.

Before I could say a word,the man immediately dropped to his knees in front of me,pleading bitterly.

‚ÄúLiora,it was my fault,I wronged you.The drug was just too strong,I couldn‚Äôt help myself,that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear it was just this once.I‚Äôll never do it again.Please,don‚Äôt divorce me!‚Äù

After ten years of being in love,I believed him.

Two months later,my husband was drugged again.This time,I was right next [door.As](http://door.As) I walked over,I heard one of his companions teasing:

""Tavian,every time you come here,you take an pill.Aren‚Äôt you afraid you‚Äôll drop dead one day?""

The man's voice was hoarse.""I'm not afraid.Even if I die on her,it's worth it.""

With that,he leaned over the woman beside him.

I felt as if I had been struck by lightning,instinctively clutching the prenatal checkup report in my bag.

So,this so-called drug effect was just a lie to cover up his cheating.

If that's the case,then I might as well abort the child I finally conceived after five long years‚Ä¶

Without hesitation,I pulled out my phone and scheduled an miscarriage.

The next second,the phone rang.The caller sounded drunk,with a hint of a coquettish tone.

""How about you divorce him and marry me?""

""Okay.""

‚Äî‚Äî

The person on the other end of the line fell silent,stunned.After a long pause,he finally spoke,""Really?""

Listening to the sounds of groaning coming from the private room,I nodded.""Really.If I'm lying,I'm done!""

After the call ended,I drove back to the seaside apartment Tavian had specially designed for me.I couldn't help but recall our past.

We had been together for ten years,married for seven.I had stood by Tavian through everything,from having nothing to becoming someone admired by all.

On countless nights,he would breathe heavily by my ear,gripping my hand tightly.""Liora,I swear I‚Äôll never let you down for the rest of my life.""

And I believed him.

I thought we would be different from others,but in the end,we still couldn‚Äôt escape the seven-year itch.

A sudden pain pierced my heart and tears welled up in my eyes,spilling over uncontrollably.

Tavian,in the end,you still betrayed me.

After a long while,I got up and went to the study.I printed a copy of the divorce [agreement.One](http://agreement.One) stroke at a time,I signed my name.

Just as the pen left the paper,Tavian called.

‚ÄúLiora,hurry and drive to Green Hospital.Melia‚Ä¶suddenly started bleeding a lot down there‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tavian had always been calm and¬†[composed.In](http://composed.in/)¬†the seven years of our marriage,even when I drank myself into gastric bleeding to help his career,he had never once lost control like this.

Driven by a doctor‚Äôs instinct,I rushed to the hospital.

When I arrived at the emergency room,I saw Tavian cradling a young woman in his arms,whispering soothing words.‚ÄúDon't be scared.I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you.‚Äù

The moment he saw me,he shouted desperately,‚ÄúLiora,please save her!I‚Äôm begging you,save her!‚Äù

Swallowing the bitter ache in my chest,I pulled over a surgical stretcher and motioned for him to lay her down.

On the way to the operating room,Melia leaned weakly against Tavian,looking as if she could collapse at any moment.

""Tavian‚Ä¶am I going to die?I'm only 22‚Ä¶I haven't even gotten married yet...""

Tavian‚Äôs face was full of distress.‚ÄúNonsense,of course you won‚Äôt!We still have so much ahead of us!‚Äù

But the young girl was still unwilling to give up.‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶can you say you love me?I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to hold on‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tavian hesitated for a few seconds.Before I could turn my head,I heard his deep voice.

Chapter 2

‚ÄúMelia,I love you!I‚Äôve loved you for a long time!If it weren‚Äôt for that damned marriage certificate,I‚Äôd marry you this instant!‚Äù

In that moment,it felt as if my heart had been torn into pieces and every breath came with searing pain...

Tavian‚Äôs passionate vows only came to an end when we reached the doors of the operating room.

During the examination,because it was under local anesthesia,Melia remained conscious the entire time.

From the moment she was wheeled in,her once pitiful expression shifted into one of provocation.

‚ÄúLiora,do you know why I was bleeding?It‚Äôs because Tavian was too rough.He pressed me up against the sink and that‚Äôs what caused it.‚Äù

I ignored her,but Melia was relentless,continuing to describe all kinds of intimate details about her and Tavian‚Äôs bedroom affairs.

When the ultrasound probe revealed she was pregnant,my hand suddenly trembled.

Just then,the assistant walked in.Forcing myself to stay calm,I asked her to finish the suturing procedure and stepped out to wash my face.

The moment I opened the door,Tavian rushed over frantically.

‚ÄúLiora,how is she?Is she okay?‚Äù

I kept my expression blank.

‚ÄúEarly pregnancy.The bleeding was caused by intense physical activity.She‚Äôll need to stay overnight for observation.If there are no issues,she can be discharged tomorrow.‚Äù

Tavian stood there stunned,unable to suppress the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

After a long pause,he finally noticed me,then dropped to his knees with a thud.

‚ÄúLiora‚Ä¶I took her virginity and now she‚Äôs pregnant.I‚Äôm begging you,please let me keep this baby.Let me take responsibility for her‚Ä¶just this once!‚Äù

""I promise,everything between us will stay the same.And since you can‚Äôt get pregnant anyway,once the baby is born,I‚Äôll bring it back for you to raise!""

My eyes instantly welled up.I lowered my gaze,not wanting him to see.

""Okay.""

Tavian,I would give you my blessing and let you took full responsibility.

The next morning,I was woken by the noise of large bags being carried downstairs.

As I stepped down,I saw Tavian walking in with Melia in his arms,his hands full of this season‚Äôs latest luxury items.

When he saw me,a flicker of panic flashed across his eyes.He quickly tried to explain,""Liora,the hospital was too crowded,not ideal for her recovery.I thought the sea breeze and scenery might lift her mood,so I brought her back.""

""Can she stay here for a while?Just until the baby‚Äôs born‚Ä¶Then I‚Äôll have her move out.""

Before I could say a word,Melia walked over with a face full of sincerity

‚ÄúLiora,thank you so much for yesterday.If it weren‚Äôt for you,Tavian and I might have lost our baby.‚Äù

Then she stepped closer,leaning in to whisper so only the two of us could hear:

‚ÄúLiora,I truly pity you.First,I got pregnant with your husband‚Äôs child.Then he brought me back to your home.Tell me,what‚Äôs next?Should I take your place and become Mrs.Mercer?‚Äù

Her face was full of smug provocation,but I simply smiled calmly.‚ÄúSure.You can have the title of Mrs.Mercer.‚Äù

Melia,however,suddenly grabbed my arm,her eyes turning red with emotion.

‚ÄúLiora,you‚Ä¶you‚Äôve misunderstood me.I‚Äôm not trying to take your place and I never wanted to steal Tavian for myself‚Ä¶‚Äù

With that,she dropped to her knees,despite her leg still being wrapped in gauze.

‚ÄúLiora,I was [wrong.It](http://wrong.It) was all my fault.I shouldn‚Äôt have volunteered to be Mr.Mercer‚Äôs cure‚Ä¶and I never should‚Äôve gotten pregnant with his baby!‚Äù

""But I really never meant to ruin your marriage with Tavian.I just‚Ä¶I truly want to give birth to this child.Please don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶once the baby is born,I‚Äôll leave far,far away.I promise I won‚Äôt ever be an eyesore to you again!""

Chapter 3

Tears instantly welled up in Melia‚Äôs eyes,as if she had just suffered the greatest grievance in the world.

Tavian immediately pulled her into his arms from behind,then turned to look at me with a coldness I had never seen before.

‚ÄúLiora,what‚Äôs the meaning of this?Didn‚Äôt you promise me you‚Äôd let her keep the baby?If you have any issues,take them out on me.Why are you making things hard for a young girl like her?‚Äù

Melia,pale-faced,curled up weakly in his arms and whispered,‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not her fault.It‚Äôs me.I‚Äôve wronged her.I‚Ä¶I‚Äôll go to the hospital now and have the baby aborted!I swear I won‚Äôt bother you two ever again!‚Äù

As she spoke,she tried to get up and leave,but Tavian frantically pulled her back into his arms.

‚ÄúNo,Melia,you did nothing wrong.‚Äù

Then he turned to me with a cold,cutting gaze.‚ÄúLiora,apologize.‚Äù

I let out a short,mocking laugh.‚ÄúAnd why should I?‚Äù

Tavian‚Äôs eyes were bloodshot.‚ÄúBecause you made things difficult for her!‚Äù

Seeing the situation escalate,Melia quickly grabbed my hand,her voice trembling.‚ÄúLiora,please don‚Äôt be upset with Mr.Mercer.He only said that because he was [worried.How](http://worried.How) could I possibly let you apologize to me?It‚Äôs all my fault.‚Äù

I suddenly flung her hand away.‚ÄúHave you finished your little act?‚Äù

The words had barely left my mouth when Tavian,seething with rage,shoved me hard from behind.

My lower abdomen slammed into the sharp corner of the coffee table,sending a wave of pain that left me drenched in cold sweat.

‚ÄúLiora,you‚Äôre truly beyond [redemption.You](http://redemption.You) dare lay a hand on her in front of me?I‚Äôll say it one last time,apologize to her!‚Äù

I stared him straight in the eyes and enunciated each word clearly.‚ÄúNot a chance.I will never apologize to her!‚Äù

Tavian‚Äôs gaze darkened instantly.He grabbed a fistful of my hair and dragged me into the kitchen.

Then he ordered the bodyguards to bring in a large basket full of mangoes.

‚ÄúIf you still refuse to repent‚Ä¶then you‚Äôd better learn what that costs.‚Äù

I looked up in disbelief and screamed,""Tavian,are you insane?Did you forget that I'm allergic to mangoes?Are you trying to kill me?""

His voice was ice-cold.""I know.But since you hurt Melia,you need to pay the price.""

With that,he forcefully shoved a mango into my mouth,with its skin still on.I shook my head desperately,but several bodyguards,following orders,pinned down my shoulders tightly.

Chunks of mango flesh kept entering my¬†[throat.My](http://throat.my/)¬†whole body started itching and my breathing became labored.

In a daze,I recalled how,shortly after we got married,I accidentally ate a bite of mango-filled cake.Tavian had rushed me to the hospital,eyes red with panic and stayed by my side for three whole days and nights.

Since then,every servant in the house knew one unshakable rule that mangoes were strictly forbidden in our home.

But now,everything had changed...

Gradually,I couldn‚Äôt breathe anymore.Just before I lost consciousness,I heard Tavian‚Äôs cold,emotionless voice.""Force every last piece of mango into her.Don‚Äôt leave a single bite behind!""

When I opened my eyes again,Tavian was gently wiping the tears that had fallen in my sleep.

For a fleeting moment,I felt like nothing had changed.

But then,his next words brought me crashing back to reality.

‚ÄúDo you admit you were wrong,Liora?Why are you always so stubborn!‚Äù

Yes...this wasn‚Äôt the first time I had been stubborn.

Back then,when my parents opposed my marriage to Tavian,I cut ties with them just to secure a piece of paper,that was our marriage certificate.

The last words my mother said to me before she passed were:

‚ÄúLiora,one day,you‚Äôll regret this.‚Äù

Chapter 4

Now,everything had come true.

I lifted my head and looked straight into Tavian‚Äôs eyes.""Let‚Äôs get a divorce.""

He stared at me in disbelief:

""What kind of joke is this?You want to divorce me?Just because of Melia?I already told you that she‚Äôs pregnant and since you can‚Äôt have children anyway,this works out perfectly!""

I let out a bitter laugh,my fingertips instinctively resting on my lower abdomen.

""This is the divorce agreement.Take a look.""

Tavian‚Äôs expression suddenly turned cold.""Liora,are you throwing a tantrum?I‚Äôve already explained everything.Nothing will change.And now we even have a [child.How](http://child.How) is that not a good thing?""

I shook my head and handed him the divorce papers.

""It‚Äôs not good.Tavian,I find you disgusting.‚Äù

His temper flared instantly.‚ÄúDisgusting?Liora,do you even know how many women are waiting for me to dat with them?Why can‚Äôt you just be more generous!‚Äù

With that,he tore the divorce agreement into pieces.‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you,I won‚Äôt agree to the divorce.Absolutely not!Look at yourself,you're already thirty and I‚Äôve had my way with you so many times,who else would want you besides me?‚Äù

After tearing the papers into shreds,he slammed the door and left.

I sent the electronic version of the agreement to my lawyer to handle,then packed my mother‚Äôs last belongings into my bag,preparing to leave.

Just as I reached the front door,a few men covered my mouth and dragged me into an alley.

Before I could ask who they were,Melia emerged from the crowd,her eyes full of blatant malice.

‚ÄúLiora,I didn‚Äôt want to touch you at first,but you had to go and get pregnant without any shame!Tell me,how could I possibly let the beast in your womb threaten my child?‚Äù

I forced down my fear and said,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,I‚Äôve already scheduled an [miscarriage.No](http://miscarriage.No) one will compete with you.‚Äù

Melia sneered,""I prefer to trust my own eyes.""

Then,with a flick of her finger,several burly men pinned me down and tore my clothes apart viciously.

""Ah,help!Please spare me!I‚Äôll give you anything!I‚Äôm pregnant‚Ä¶please don‚Äôt hit my belly,help!""

At that moment,Tavian rushed over and the men vanished without a trace.

He shoved me away harshly and hurriedly caught Melia,who had collapsed to the ground.

Her eyes were red from crying.""Liora,I know you‚Äôre angry at me,but the child is [innocent.How](http://innocent.How) could you send people to beat me and specifically target my stomach?""

Tavian was burning with rage;his gaze seemed laced with venom.

Before I could say anything,he slapped me hard across the face.

He used all his strength and I fell straight to the ground.

Suddenly,I laughed.I laughed until tears fell.

Tavian didn‚Äôt even ask a single question.Without hesitation,he sentenced me to death.

Ten years of love couldn't compare to someone else's performance...

Then he scooped Melia into his arms and ordered the two bodyguards behind him,""Make her go through everything Melia just suffered,especially her abdomen!""

I was in disbelief and shook my head desperately.""Tavian,I haven't done anything [wrong.You](http://wrong.You) can't treat me like this!""

He ignored me completely and simply said to the bodyguards,""Do it.""

Fierce fists pounded into my body,into my abdomen,while Tavian stood above me,looking down without a trace of mercy in his eyes.

Not long after,a sharp pain surged in my lower belly and I felt a continuous flow of liquid beneath me.

As a gynecologist,I was painfully aware that...

Chapter 5

The baby couldn‚Äôt be saved.

Along with that,the last shred of hope I had for this relationship vanished too.

But the fists didn‚Äôt stop.I was in so much pain that my vision darkened and I begged in broken whispers,‚ÄúTavian...my stomach hurts...please stop...‚Äù

He gave me a cold look,his voice utterly indifferent.‚ÄúStill pretending?Anyone who doesn't know might think you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs pregnant!‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt until my white dress was stained red with blood that Tavian realized something was wrong.He then ordered the bodyguards to take me to the hospital.

Before losing consciousness,my colleagues anxiously watched my body bleed profusely.I mustered my last bit of strength to say,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell anyone I‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äù

After that,I closed my eyes with a sense of relief.

When I woke up again,I realized I had been unconscious for two whole days.Luckily,my colleagues had stayed by my side the entire time.But Tavian hadn‚Äôt appeared even once.

I looked everywhere and noticed my phone and my mother‚Äôs belongings were missing.Thinking they might be at home,I hurried to take a taxi back.

When I pushed open the door,I saw Melia sitting on Tavian‚Äôs lap wearing lingerie,casually playing with him.

When she saw me,she gasped and quickly grabbed a bathrobe to cover herself.

Tavian suddenly stopped,looking at me with displeasure.‚ÄúHow come you‚Äôre back?‚Äù

I kept a blank expression.‚ÄúJust here to get something,I‚Äôll leave soon‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before I could finish,out of the corner of my eye,I caught sight of the necklace on Melia‚Äôs¬†[neck.My](http://neck.my/)¬†breath hitched sharply.

That was the only keepsake my mother left me.

Five years ago,she had an accident at sea and her body was never found.The only thing she left behind were these 18 crystal pearls.

Tavian,worried I would be too devastated,had gone all the way to Pendarra Mountain to perform a ritual to bless these pearls,then strung them into a necklace as a keepsake for me.

And now,he had let another woman wear it,one dressed in lingerie.

Sensing the resentment in my eyes,Melia looked smug and said,‚ÄúLiora,Tavian said this necklace shines so [brightly.It](http://brightly.It) suits my fair skin perfectly.What do you think?‚Äù

I quickly walked up to her,trembling as I said,‚ÄúGive it back to me!‚Äù

But Melia held tightly onto the necklace around her neck.‚ÄúLiora,do you hate me that much?You just have to snatch the gift Tavian gave me away?‚Äù

Seeing she wouldn‚Äôt let go,I moved forward to grab it,but before I could even touch it,Tavian kicked me hard in the stomach.

‚ÄúLiora,are you fucking crazy or what?It‚Äôs just a lousy necklace!And you actually fought with her over it!‚Äù

The wound that had been stitched up was now being torn open violently,but I didn‚Äôt care about the pain.I just wanted desperately to get the necklace back.

But Tavian didn‚Äôt give me any chance at all.He directly yanked the necklace off and,facing the bottomless sea outside the window,my pupils constricted as I begged desperately,‚ÄúPlease,don‚Äôt!‚Äù

The next moment,the necklace slipped right from his hand and vanished into the endless ocean.‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs see how you‚Äôre going to get it back!‚Äù

After saying that,Tavian pulled Melia into the bedroom,where groans immediately began to echo.

I leapt off the balcony and the seawater quickly swallowed my breath.Just as I thought I could soon find my mother,a force behind me grabbed me with all its might,pulling me back up.

‚ÄúLiora,you aren‚Äôt allowed to die on me!You still haven‚Äôt taken responsibility for [me.You](http://me.You) said if you lie,you'll be done.Please,don‚Äôt leave me!‚Äù

Later,big drops of tears burned my skin.

‚ÄúLiora,you can‚Äôt break your [promise.You](http://promise.You) can‚Äôt leave me alone,or else I won‚Äôt let you rest even as a ghost!‚Äù

Pressed hard against my chest,I suddenly spat out the seawater from my nose,gasping for breath and said,‚ÄúDanny,take me away.‚Äù

Two days later,Tavian got off Melia‚Äôs bed.He shouted my name loudly throughout the villa,but no one answered.

Just as he was feeling puzzled,the property manager hurried in,‚ÄúMr.Mercer,there‚Äôs bad news.The body of a woman was found by the shore.It‚Äôs your wife!‚Äù

In my family,there's a tradition we have to follow.

The next heir must have a child with the strongest and most attractive man available.

Sounds noble,maybe even romantic,but it's more like The Bachelor meets a corporate blood pact.

In my last life,I pulled Desmond Caldwell‚Äôs name from the heirloom box of selection tokens.

The six-foot-two golden boy of the Caldwell dynasty.

Heir to a billion-dollar empire,all angles and cheekbones,with a jawline that made socialites swoon and an ego that could sink nations.

He once filled an entire garden with roses just for me.Whispered lines as if he‚Äôd swallowed a romance novel made me believe in the fantasy‚Äîwhite picket fences,candlelit dinners,forever.

I believed him.I let myself believe it.

And then,five months into my pregnancy,Desmond locked me in a cage.

A literal cage.Dog-sized.Steel bars.Cold cement.

He stood just beyond it,looking me straight in the eye,while he dat with another woman.

‚ÄúYou know what happened the day you pulled my name?‚Äùhe said,his voice sickly calm.‚ÄúGwen miscarried.She bled out.Her parents died in a car [crash.You](http://crash.You) owe her this.‚Äù

By the third day,my family had gone [bankrupt.My](http://bankrupt.My) father was dead from a fall no one could explain.

By the fifth,he‚Äôd sent ninety-nine of his private bodyguards to‚Äútake turns‚Äùwith me.

By the seventh,I miscarried.

By the ninth,I died.

And right before everything went dark,I heard his voice,soft,almost tender,like we hadn‚Äôt just destroyed each other.

Holding Gwen Bentley in his arms,he told her,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.Cassandra's family‚Äôs hundred-billion-dollar fortune is all yours now.‚Äù

But this time around?

I pulled a different name.

The one nobody wanted:Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

People called him the Madman of Metropolis.

Crippled.Disfigured.

Rumor was,he‚Äôd burned his own mother alive.People crossed the street when they saw him coming.

Later on,once untouchable,Desmond Caldwell would kneel in front of that same dog cage,where I was humiliated.

Blood on his face.

Nails broken.

Banging his head into the concrete like a man begging for a past he couldn‚Äôt undo.

And this time,it is my rise and my revenge.

‚Äî‚Äî

It all began at a long,gleaming table,solid mahogany,daunting in its perfection,the kind of table where futures are signed and lives are sold.

Twelve men in dark suits sat around it,grave and motionless.

Titans of industry.Kingmakers.

My father sat at the head,wearing that polished smile he used when cameras were on.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,like this was just another item on today‚Äôs agenda.‚ÄúPick one.These men have waited long enough to see you settled.‚Äù

On the table lay a bundle of selection tokens‚Äîeach carved with the names of powerful families'sons.Prestige etched in lacquered wood.

But one token looked [different.Faded.Weathered.Like](http://different.Faded.Weathered.Like) no one had touched it in years.

My eyes landed on it immediately.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

The name you weren‚Äôt supposed to say in polite company.

The one that made people lean in and whisper,'Poor thing,'before changing the subject.

They said he was ruined.Broken.Walked with a limp and a mangled leg.The D‚ÄôAngelos didn‚Äôt even bother to show up,and they sent some half-relative to pull the token for him.

But I remembered.

I remembered bleeding in that cage,humiliated,stripped of everything in my past life.The people who used to suck up to me were snapping pictures and laughing like it was a show.

Only one person knelt beside me.

Terrence D'Angelo.

And even as I was fading,he pulled out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood from my face.

That was all it took.

I reached out and,without a second thought,selected his family token.

The room went dead silent.

My father‚Äôs face froze,like he couldn‚Äôt quite believe what he saw.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said,voice low,like I‚Äôd just announced I was marrying a corpse.‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI want him,‚ÄùI replied firmly.

He stared at me for a long,heavy beat,then leaned back and let out a slow,tired sigh.

‚ÄúFine.But if he ever lays a hand on you‚Äî‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt finish.He didn‚Äôt have to.Everyone in the room felt the weight behind the warning.

...

As I exited that suffocating room,I ran right into Desmond.

And Gwen.

Her eyes were red and watery.Her shoulders trembled like the whole world had come crashing down on her delicate little frame.

‚ÄúMs.Mercier,‚Äùshe said,her voice shaky,‚ÄúI know you hate me.But that studio...it meant everything to me.Why‚Äôd you destroy it?‚Äù

Before I could even breathe,Desmond stepped in front of her,as if shielding some precious treasure.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe snapped.‚ÄúYou really stooped this low just to force me to marry you?‚Äù

I looked at both of them,my voice flat.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù

I turned to leave,but Desmond grabbed my wrist tightly.

‚ÄúApologize.Pay for the damages.Or forget ever setting foot in the Caldwell estate again.‚Äù

Gwen yanked at his arm.‚ÄúDesmond,don‚Äôt!Cassie,it‚Äôs all my fault.""

Turning to me,she said,tears welling in her eyes,""I‚Äôll kneel if I have to.Just please...give me back the studio.‚Äù

Desmond‚Äôs anger only grew at her words.‚ÄúApologize to Gwen.She‚Äôs not in good health.Hand over that wellness center you own‚Äîshe needs it.‚Äù

And he kept going.‚ÄúGive her twenty of your best staff.Please make sure they‚Äôre professionals,the best ones.And a private medical team on standby 24/7.‚Äù

Chapter 2

I suddenly yanked my hand out of Desmond‚Äôs grip and let out a sharp,loud laugh.‚ÄúGod,[Desmond.Do](http://Desmond.Do) you really think that highly of yourself?‚Äù

I looked him square in the eyes,not blinking.‚ÄúThe name I picked...wasn‚Äôt yours.‚Äù

For a split second,something flickered in Gwen‚Äôs eyes‚Äîthere and gone before she masked it with a wide-eyed blink.

‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚ÄùDesmond‚Äôs pupils narrowed.But he quickly twisted his expression into a smug sneer.‚ÄúGive it a rest.You‚Äôre jealous I treat Gwen the way you always wanted me to.That‚Äôs what this is.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bother replying.I turned my back on him and walked out.

It felt [good.Clean.Like](http://good.Clean.Like) shutting a door and finally locking it for good.

For the first time,I had picked someone else.Someone who wasn‚Äôt Desmond Caldwell.Just thinking about it sent a slow,sweet satisfaction burning through my chest.

...

The next day,I headed to Gallery71‚Äîmy gallery.I wanted to find something to give Terrence,something personal.

A painting for our first meeting.Something symbolic.

But the moment I stepped inside,I stopped cold.

The walls were lined with portraits of Gwen.

Gwen lowered her head,seeming both modest and fragile.Her cheeks glistened with tears,and she shook slightly.

Turning back,she offered a timid smile.

Each painting was meticulously framed and illuminated by soft light,reminiscent of sacred artifacts.

‚ÄúDo you like them?‚ÄùDesmond‚Äôs voice drifted across the room.Smooth,warm,like it hadn‚Äôt once been used to damn me.

He stood beside her,gently brushing a hand down Gwen‚Äôs cheek.

‚ÄúEvery year on your birthday,‚Äùhe said,‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you the most special gift.‚Äù

Gwen flushed,voice syrupy.‚ÄúDesmond,you spoil me.‚Äù

Then she stood on her toes and kissed him.Just a little peck.

But not for long.

Seconds later,it deepened,their bodies pulling together like they‚Äôd forgotten the rest of the world existed.

I leaned against the doorframe and knocked my knuckles once against it.

They jolted apart like I‚Äôd hit them with a stun gun.

Desmond‚Äôs face darkened.‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

I kept my tone flat.‚ÄúThis is my [gallery.Do](http://gallery.Do) I need permission to walk into my own space?‚Äù

My chest was tight.I could feel the pressure building behind my ribs.

This place‚Äîthis gallery‚Äîwas one of the last things my mother left me.I handed it over to him in my last life.I had trusted him with everything.

And this was what he did with it.

Desmond‚Äôs mouth pulled into a crooked smirk.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the attitude?‚Äù

He let out a quiet laugh,the kind that always made me want to slap it off his face.‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chasing after me since we were kids,[Cassie.Is](http://Cassie.Is) this the part where you pretend you don‚Äôt care?Playing hard to get now?‚Äù

‚ÄúC'mon,cut the act,‚Äùhe snapped,his tone sharp and ugly.‚ÄúWe both know you‚Äôre obsessed with me.You‚Äôll never let go.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúSecurity,‚ÄùI said,loud and clear.‚ÄúGet these two out of here.And take down every single one of those paintings.Trash them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚ÄùGwen cried out.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt throw them away!They‚Äôre all gifts from Desmond!‚Äù

She rushed at me,grabbed my wrist,and then collapsed.

Her body slammed into the coffee table,glass shattering beneath her.A sharp edge caught her leg.Blood trickled down her shin in a bright red line.

‚ÄúCassandra!‚ÄùDesmond roared.

He shoved me hard.

I stumbled back and slammed into a metal easel.Something warm slid down my cheek.I reached up,but I couldn‚Äôt feel [it.My](http://it.My) body was too numb.

Then Desmond grabbed a bucket of paint from the corner and hurled it at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone too far!‚Äùhe shouted.

He swept Gwen into his arms like some kind of tragic prince and stormed out with her in his arms.

I sank to my knees in the middle of the chaos‚Äîtorn canvases,shattered glass everywhere.

""Where‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs painting‚ÄòSpring Bloom‚Äô?‚ÄùI asked,my voice hollow.

A staff member pointed toward the corner.His hand trembled.

I followed his gaze.

There it was.

The painting my mother had poured her soul into was her last work before she [died.It](http://died.It) had hung in this gallery since the day it opened.

Now it was ruined.Smeared in red paint like someone had bled across it.The vibrant colors were lost under the sludge‚Äîtwisted,smeared,defaced.

I stumbled over and sank to the ground in front of it.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚ÄùI whispered.

I clutched the wrecked canvas to my chest,ignoring the glass biting into my palms.Blood from my forehead dripped down onto the painting,mixing with my tears.

...

Wheels rolled softly across the tile floor.

I looked up.

There,just outside the reach of the light,someone sat watching me.The sharp edge of a silver mask caught the glow,polished and cold.But behind it,his lashes were trembling.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.

‚ÄúStop crying,‚Äùhe said.His voice was low.Steady.Not unkind.

His eyes flicked to the cut on my forehead,then quickly looked away.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

He held out a small tube of ointment.His hand was steady,but when our eyes met,his fingers curled slightly and pulled back.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt use it,‚Äùhe said quietly,‚Äúit‚Äôll scar.‚Äù

I looked at the ointment in my hand,still stunned.Then something clicked.

The D‚ÄôAngelo family.Of course.

They were the most respected medical family in the city.They were behind almost every hospital and pharmaceutical breakthrough.They practically ran the entire healthcare industry.

As I reached for the medicine,I felt his fingertips tremble just before he pulled away completely.

‚ÄúI know you were forced to pick me,‚ÄùTerrence said,his voice rough.

He spoke slowly,like every word cost him something.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll cancel the [engagement.You](http://engagement.You) don‚Äôt have to force yourself.‚Äù

Chapter 3

A soft,rusty creak announced the wheelchair's turn,the prelude to his leaving.

‚ÄúWait!‚ÄùI rushed forward,stepping in front of him.

He stopped short.His head turned sharply to the side,as if he didn‚Äôt want me to see his expression.

""I meant what I said,""I told him,steady.I met his eyes and didn‚Äôt look away.""You‚Äôre the one I chose.""

His hands clenched the armrests so hard his knuckles went pale.The tips of his ears turned a deep,vivid red.

A long pause hung between us.

Then,barely audible,Terrence said,""Mm.""

...

Over the next few days,boxes of medicine and supplements appeared at my door.

All from Terrence.

The wound on my forehead had scabbed,healing slowly.But every time I changed the bandage,I remembered how red his ears had gotten that day,how stiff and nervous he looked.And every time,something warm settled quietly in my chest.

A few days later,I stepped into a luxury boutique and practically walked into a scene straight out of my nightmares.

""Desmond,I love all of these!""Gwen‚Äôs sugary voice floated through the air when I walked in.

Her fingers brushed across her stomach,subtle but intentional.

Desmond‚Äôs voice followed,indulgent and cool.""Then get them all.Put it on Cassandra‚Äôs tab.""

I stepped further inside,my cold laugh cutting clean through the air.

Desmond spotted me,but he didn‚Äôt even flinch.

No guilt,no hesitation.

""You pushed Gwen the last time you saw her.She got hurt,""he said,like he was reading from a script.""This is compensation.""

Gwen's eyes lit up the moment she saw the jacket I was wearing.

""Desmond,""she said,breathless,""I really want Cassandra‚Äôs coat.""

The shop assistant looked trapped.""I'm sorry,but this coat is a global,limited edition.Ms.Mercier reserved it six months ago.""

Gwen looked down,playing the part.Her voice dropped to a whisper.""It‚Äôs fine.Someone like me doesn‚Äôt deserve something that expensive.""

And right on cue,her hand found her stomach again.

Desmond's eyes narrowed.

Then he turned to me,voice like stone.""You have more clothes than you could ever wear.Give her this one.""

I stared at him.""Why should I?""

‚ÄúCall it compensation,‚Äùhe said,voice dipping lower.‚ÄúYou shoved her at the gallery,and her knee‚Äôs still bruised.‚Äù

Just as I opened my mouth to respond,Gwen suddenly wobbled.

Desmond caught her,instantly alarmed.""You okay?""

""I‚Äôm fine,""she murmured,weakly shaking her head‚Äîthen,again,touched her stomach.

Desmond turned to me,his voice cutting.""Cassandra.Give.Her.The.Coat.""

I let out a short laugh and turned to the two bodyguards posted by the door.""Throw them out.""

But they hesitated.

One of them said softly,""Ms.Mercier,you‚Äôre marrying into the Caldwell family eventually...maybe you should just hear Mr.Desmond out.""

Before I could respond,Desmond shot them a look.

That was all it took.

Next thing I knew,I was slammed onto the cold marble floor.Pain shot through my back.

""Take it off,""Desmond barked.

The shop assistant stood frozen,horrified.""Sir...""

Desmond looked down at me and sneered.

Then,he turned to the assistant and said,""Don't bother.She‚Äôs been chasing me for years.After we get married,I‚Äôll be the one calling the shots anyway.""

The assistant trembled as she reached for the coat,undoing the buttons with shaking hands.

When they yanked it off me,my whole body trembled with fury.

I wanted to scream,to claw the smug look off his face.

Desmond gently wrapped the coat around Gwen,his voice soft.""Gwen,you look way better in it.""

Gwen bit her lip.""But...is this okay?What if Cassie gets upset,Desmond?""

Then Desmond whipped out his phone and started snapping photos of me,disheveled,humiliated,on the floor.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said coldly,‚Äúif you ever come after Gwen again,I‚Äôll make sure the whole internet sees you like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúDesmond,you're a shameless man,you deserve to die!,""I retorted.

My fists clenched tight,nails digging into my palms.

The look on his face was exactly like the one from my past life‚Äîarrogant and shameless.

One of the shop assistants finally moved,stepping forward to hand me a silk [scarf.No](http://scarf.No) words.Just quiet solidarity.

I wrapped it around myself and walked out,head high,chest burning.

...

When I got home,bruised and shaken,my father took one look at me and froze.

The antiseptic smell was thick in the air.A teacup rested on the table beside him.

He picked it up and hurled it across the [room.It](http://room.It) exploded into shards against the wall.

""That goddamn Caldwell brat laid hands on you?""His voice was thunder.""We‚Äôre dealing with the Caldwells.Now.""

Chapter 4

‚ÄúDad,don‚Äôt work yourself up,‚ÄùI said,wiping sweat from my brow.‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my way of handling them.But first,we need to deal with the snakes already inside our walls.‚Äù

One week before the wedding,I went to the cemetery alone.

The sky hung low,an overcast sheet of gray,and the air was thick with stillness.I knelt in front of my mother‚Äôs tombstone,fingers gently sweeping away the dust settled over her name.

‚ÄúMom,‚ÄùI whispered,‚ÄúI'm not making the same mistakes this time.‚Äù

Right then,my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I glanced at the [screen.It](http://screen.It) was a bank notification.

\[$50,000,000 withdrawn.\]

The breath caught in my throat.

I immediately dialed my assistant.

‚ÄúMs.Mercier,‚Äùshe answered,voice shaking,‚Äúsomeone forged your signature.They cleaned out the account.Every cent is gone.‚Äù

...

Twenty minutes later,I stormed into Gwen‚Äôs freshly opened studio.The door slammed behind me,and the room went still.

‚ÄúDesmond,you cheap man!‚Äù

The name cracked out of me like a gunshot.Everyone froze.

‚ÄúWho gave you the right to touch my trust fund?‚Äù

Desmond turned toward me,slow and smug,like he‚Äôd been waiting for the moment.

‚ÄúCassandra,‚Äùhe said coolly,‚Äúyou‚Äôve bullied Gwen repeatedly.That money?Consider it your apology.‚Äù

Then he raised his voice,projecting it for everyone in the room.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting married anyway.It‚Äôll all be joint property.Don‚Äôt be so petty.‚Äù

My pulse pounded in my [ears.Black](http://ears.Black) spots clouded my vision.

And then I saw a necklace,gleaming against Gwen‚Äôs collarbone.

It was my mother‚Äôs pearl necklace.

The one I‚Äôd locked away in a safety deposit box.

I pointed at her.‚ÄúTake that necklace off!‚Äù

Gwen blinked fast and stepped behind Desmond,her lip quivering.

He frowned,clearly irritated.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an old necklace,Cassandra.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said,take it off!‚ÄùI lunged forward and grabbed at it.

The strand snapped,pearls flying across the hardwood floor like shattered promises.

Before I knew it,my hand lashed out.

I slapped Gwen hard across the face.

She shrieked and stumbled back,clutching her cheek like I‚Äôd branded her.

Desmond shoved me.

‚ÄúAre you insane?!‚Äùhe roared.

I slowly straightened,stared him dead in the eye,and didn‚Äôt so much as flinch.

He faltered,just slightly,taking half a step back.

His Adam‚Äôs apple bobbed as he muttered,‚ÄúI-It‚Äôs just a damn necklace‚Ä¶no reason to blow this up.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees and started gathering the pearls,shaking my hands.Each one was dull with dust and no longer shining.

Just like the love I‚Äôd once believed in‚Äîcrushed under his heel repeatedly.

...

Back in the car,I sat gripping the velvet pouch so tightly that the veins in my hands stood [out.My](http://out.My) whole body burned.

Then,I opened my phone.

And there it was,blazing across social media.

\[#HeiressPubliclyStripped\]

Front and center.

Photos of me:coat gone,hair a mess,humiliated.Gwen wrapped in my jacket,leaning into Desmond‚Äôs chest like some tragic love story.

The caption read:

\[What‚Äôs stolen will never truly belong to you.\]

I stared at the screen for a second.Then turned it off.

That line?

I gave it right back to her in my head,ice cold.'What‚Äôs stolen will never truly be yours,Gwen.You've done enough in my past.Not this time.'

The backlash hit fast and brutal.Comments flooded in like knives.

\[Mercier heiress really is a joke.Her fianc√©straightened her out.\]

\[Look at that pathetic expression.Geez,no wonder she gets stepped on.\]

When I called my assistant,my voice was eerily calm.‚ÄúScrub everything.Every post.Every photo.I don‚Äôt care how.‚Äù

Then,I added,‚ÄúAnd I want that money back‚Äîevery dollar.I don‚Äôt care how we do it or who we have to pressure.If the bank delays,get the legal team involved.And if anyone tries to stop us‚Ä¶‚Äù

I let out a quiet,humorless laugh.

‚ÄúLet them learn what happens when they mess with the Merciers.‚Äù

...

The morning of the wedding,my phone rang.

Desmond.

His voice slid through the receiver,smug and relaxed like nothing had happened.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,like we were old friends.‚ÄúAbout the necklace‚Ä¶You really scared Gwen.She‚Äôs pregnant.She can‚Äôt handle that kind of stress.‚Äù

I stood in front of the mirror,lipstick in hand.I dragged the crimson across my lips slowly,deliberately.

In the reflection,my expression didn‚Äôt waver.

Cold.Composed.Lethal.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why you leaked the photos?‚ÄùI said lightly.‚ÄúTo calm her nerves?‚Äù

Desmond scoffed.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that your dad‚Äôs mining project still depends on my family‚Äôs contacts.Without me,who‚Äôs going to help you?‚Äù

Chapter 5

I carefully set the lipstick down,letting my fingertips tap a soft rhythm along the edge of the vanity.

On the other end of the line,Desmond spoke like he was offering me a favor,not a threat.

‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äùhe said.‚ÄúTransfer fifty percent of your shares to Gwen as a gift for the baby.‚Äù

He chuckled,smug and casual.‚ÄúAnyway,once we‚Äôre married,what‚Äôs mine is yours too.‚Äù

In the background,Gwen‚Äôs voice chimed in,sugar-coated and delicate.‚ÄúDesmond‚Ä¶‚Äù

Instantly,his tone melted like butter.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,[sweetheart.Be](http://sweetheart.Be) careful with your belly.‚Äù

Then,like flipping a switch,he was back to business,continuing,‚ÄúAs long as you agree,I‚Äôll be at the wedding on time today.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt give him a single word.

I ended the call,blocked his number,and didn‚Äôt look back.

...

When Terrence entered the hall,it was like someone had dropped a glass at a funeral.All conversation stopped,replaced by a low wave of shocked murmurs.

He was in his wheelchair,dressed in tailored black and still wearing that signature silver mask.But when his eyes met mine,they softened.They were warm and steady.

And then‚Äîboom.The doors slammed open.

Desmond barged in like the lead actor showing up late to a play,wearing a spotless white suit and flashing that same arrogant grin‚Äîuntil his eyes landed on Terrence beside me.

That smug expression collapsed like a house of cards.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùhe said,his voice shaking.‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

His eyes narrowed in on Terrence,like he couldn‚Äôt believe what he saw.‚ÄúTerrence?!What are you doing here?!‚Äù

The whole room had gone quiet.Of course it had.

Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo didn‚Äôt go to events like this.Not ever.

I stepped forward and placed myself squarely between them.

Desmond‚Äôs face darkened,jaw tight.‚ÄúCassandra,it‚Äôs our wedding day.And you brought him here?What kind of twisted game are you playing?‚Äù

Right on cue,Gwen stepped out like she‚Äôd been waiting in the wings,one hand resting daintily on her barely-there baby bump.

‚ÄúCassie,‚Äùshe said sweetly,‚Äúeven if Desmond‚Äôs been spending more time with me lately,did you really need to drag a cripple here just to get back at him?‚Äù

I took a slow breath,trying not to let my temper spike.‚ÄúDesmond‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äùhe snapped,grabbing my wrist like he had any right.‚ÄúStarting today,I‚Äôm your husband.And this is how you behave?!‚Äù

I ripped my hand free,eyes locked on his.

Then came the emcee‚Äôs voice,booming through the speaker system:

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,welcome to the wedding ceremony of Miss Cassandra Mercier and Mr.Terrence D‚ÄôAngelo.‚Äù

1lay5a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lay5a1/an_arm_and_a_leg/,An Arm and a Leg,"Word Document 1:
Hi there, the name‚Äôs Edward Finnic. I‚Äôm an investigative journalist from Reno, Nevada. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre all familiar with my work but I mostly cover topics such as corporate corruption and government scandals. I think I found an interesting lead about a company called Collective Bios Inc. They specialize in privatized healthcare and research into prosthetics. 

What got me interested in them? For those of you reading my work for the first I suppose you wouldn‚Äôt be aware of the fact that I‚Äôm very much a unique individual. You see, I‚Äôve only got one and a half arms and barely a leg to stand on..... That‚Äôs a terrible joke by the way, my right leg only goes down as far as above the knee and my left only halfway down my shin. My right arm is reduced to a stub below the elbow and my left is the only working part of my body. Thank god I‚Äôm a lefty!

Among these wonderful circumstances I also have 70% hearing loss in my right ear and 40% in my left as well as near total blindness in my right eye and less than perfect vision in my left. I have to wear hearing aids and thick prescription glasses to function but it‚Äôs not so bad once you get used to it. I make it sound worse than it is honestly, I get by. I work out very regularly, including my stumps so I don‚Äôt get muscle atrophy from my damn wheelchair. 

I‚Äôm 34 now but I‚Äôve been this way since I was 22. My appearance actually helped my game with... partners.... maybe they feel bad or maybe they want to try something weird but I‚Äôm ok with it, everything still works like it should. As I said, I work out so I‚Äôm as fit as I can be. I always was an admittedly good looking guy and the incident didn‚Äôt do much to my face other than some shrapnel scars, my tattoos cover lots of those scars.

You may be wondering how I wound up with shrapnel scars. Well, I was a proud marine just serving his country in Afghanistan in 2008. I was always athletic and was named the most promising recruit before my tour. My unit was sent on surveillance to gather intel on a VIP. We had managed to slip into an enemy camp and proceeded to spy on them, unbeknownst to us they knew we were there. Before we could react a firefight ensued and took out some of my men, leaving us pinned in place. 

We had radioed for an emergency evacuation when one of the bogies shot a rocket from an RPG right next to the vehicle I was behind. The ensuing explosion had propelled my body and the truck about 20 feet away. Miraculously enough, my spine was ok but after waking up from my blackout I could see that my arm and both feet were pinned under the truck, crushed completely. The shrapnel also pelted my body in places, including my right eye and the sound mostly deafened me. My squad immediately got to work to pull me out as backup arrived to help evacuate us.

Once I had reached a point in the recovery process that I could function on my own - after years of mental and physical therapy - I finally started to try and live my new life again. My physical therapist - Evan - and I grew to be great friends over the years. When my therapy was done he let me move in with him. He needed extra help with rent, I needed a place to stay and it didn‚Äôt hurt he knew exactly what I needed help with and when I needed it. He got me through my darkest times when I wanted to end it all out of depression and frustration and come out on the other side a better man. I see the humor in it all and count my blessings that things weren‚Äôt worse, they definitely could have turned out that way.

Evan encouraged me to get the job I‚Äôve been doing now over the last 5 years and I love it. Whether I‚Äôm doing a piece about the good or bad in a business, you can be sure I give my honest opinions and get to the truth. It‚Äôs not hard to book those essential interviews and meetings as well as get full VIP access to places when you‚Äôre a decorated, injured veteran. It‚Äôs definitely worked to my advantages for sure. 

So enough with my backstory, you want to know why I‚Äôm so interested in Collective Bios Inc. (I‚Äôm shortening it to CBI from now on) right? An avid reader of my work has contacted me, saying he needs to meet with me and discuss the amazing things going on with this company. I‚Äôve agreed to meet him for lunch across the street from my apartment in about.... 20 minutes from the time of writing this. You can imagine how long it takes me to type this with one hand at this point I‚Äôm sure. I should really look into speech to text for the future.

Word Document 2:
I just got back from meeting my source. You can bet how surprised I was when I met a man who was also missing an arm (his left). He had an extremely rare condition in his eyes called heterochromia. Basically one eye was strikingly blue and the other a light brown. He told me he was chosen by CBI in Sacramento, among many applicants to test their new advanced prosthetics. 

He told me that him and about two dozen other arm amputees were all brought into a room where they could all sit at a table to sign many, many pages of legal documents: waivers, NDA‚Äôs and the sort to even look at the product. I‚Äôve left his name anonymous so he doesn‚Äôt face the legal repercussions (if he even is a he wink wink). He said that there were many more pages afterwards to agree to testing.

After what was undoubtedly an eternity of signing they were all brought into a white room, not unlike a lab. The prosthetic was brought out and he described it as being almost indistinguishable from a real arm. They were capable of replicating the skin tone of whoever held it, had small arm hairs, freckles or whatever blemishes a real arm would have. The researchers assured them that they can also take your fingerprints you used to have if they are on a record somewhere or make custom ones based off your DNA. Finally, they apparently can attach sensors to your nerve endings in your arms that send sensations from the prosthetic to your mind. In essence, it was a real arm to the touch and to wearers. 

A woman was the only one out of the 24 candidates that actually got to demonstrate the arm. As promised, over the course of about a minute it changed to match her skin tone and her nails changed to match the other hand. The arm reduced in size to fit her petite frame perfectly. After some mild pain and discomfort from the nodes attaching, she claimed that she could feel everything on the arm. Her tears of joy were enough to get everyone else desperate to get one. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt right was there was a crease were the arm met the real body. They were assured that this was just a prototype and they intended on using skin grafting to permanently bond the arm to give back people‚Äôs limbs for good. The researchers told everyone that they would have to come back tomorrow to get theirs.

The way he described them with such enthusiasm made me salivate at the thought of talking to CBI about their new ‚Äúmiracle product.‚Äù If I could verify the advancement in prosthetic technology to the degree they were promising, then I wouldn‚Äôt be doing my due diligence as a journalist to get the word out there! If they are phonies then I have an excuse to expose their fraudulent claims and end their money making schemes.

I made a hands free phone call with the PR manager of CBI and he was happy to oblige my meeting with the general manager of their Sacramento location by tomorrow morning. That‚Äôs about a two and a half hour drive but the way Evan drives it‚Äôs more like 2. I can check out this place for myself and maybe get a juicy insider scoop on this place.

Word Document 3:
After pulling up to the front doors, Evan let down my lift and told me that he was gonna go to one of the malls for a bit while I did this (he wasn‚Äôt invited in). He embraced me and touched my cheek as I shyly brushed him off. As soon as I wheeled through the door a grinning man was waiting at the desk. He was very unnerving with his nonstop smile and uncanny look about him. 

‚ÄúHi there Mr. Finnic! Mr. Piper will be here to see you shortly! Please grab these release papers and fill them out!‚Äù

His voice was very chipper and enthusiastic as he motioned fifteen feet to his left. The grin never leaving his face and barely blinking. His movements were also off, like when there‚Äôs a few frames missing in a movie. Subtle but noticeable. I didn‚Äôt want to take my eyes of him but felt I shouldn‚Äôt be rude. 

‚ÄúPlease have a seat over in our guest waiting area!‚Äù

I moved the chairs controls to go that direction. To try to break the tension I decided on a quip, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already sitting, but thanks for the suggestion.‚Äù

He only responded with a very unnerving ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Followed by a cackle and an unnatural rocking motion that kind of resembled a regular human-being laughing at something hilarious. Deciding to try and take my mind off of him I looked through the contract and read each line before signing. It felt like a Herculean effort not to turn back and look at the guy and keep signing. It was really basic stuff like any recording devices must be approved by CBI and that I understand I can‚Äôt take their property - you get it, nothing out of the ordinary.

After what felt like eternity - but was realistically only fifteen minutes - I heard the sound of dress shoes walking down the hall behind the double door by the desk. I rubbed my eyes under my glasses as the strain from reading was starting to give me a headache. After a few moments a man walked through, a very normal looking man in a nice suit. Slicked back hair, likely of middle eastern decent but no accent. No weird uncanny valley stuff here.

‚ÄúMr. Finnic, it‚Äôs good to finally meet the man I‚Äôve been hearing about.‚Äù He reached out his left, which I shook. 

‚ÄúLikewise, hopefully nothing but good news I hope.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúMr. Piper I presume?‚Äù

He nodded, big smile (natural at least), ‚ÄúRasheed from my mother and Piper from my father. I‚Äôve been reading your articles about all of these companies. You like to air their dirty laundry for the world to see, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say I‚Äôm-‚Äú

‚ÄúNonsense! Eddie - may I call you Eddie? - I appreciate the hard work you put in,‚Äù he didn‚Äôt even give me a chance to respond, ‚ÄúThis honest journalism is sorely needed in today‚Äôs world. You give glowing recommendations to those that deserve and condemn the malpractices of those that don‚Äôt. I respect the truth, Eddie! We need more people like you! Tell it like it is! I assure you all of our secrets are out in the open! Come! Let‚Äôs discuss further in my office.‚Äù

He grabbed my papers, turned and walked to the double doors, the assistant - still smiling that smile - grabbed them and pressed a button to make the doors open. I looked back at the guy as I passed.

Rasheed noticed my sideways glance at the man, ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve met Patrick! I know it‚Äôs weird for most people when they meet him for the first time. Your glasses probably don‚Äôt let you see as well as you would like I‚Äôm sure. He‚Äôs completely automated! The same robotics that goes in our prosthetics is used in lots of our robo-staff!‚Äù He laughed out loud, ‚ÄúClearly we haven‚Äôt quite gotten him to the point of being perfectly passable but we‚Äôre close!‚Äù

So he WAS a robot! That closed the door to that question but opened many more mysteries that needed solving.

I followed Rasheed down the hallway, he was still talking away and laughing at his own jokes but didn‚Äôt seem to care if I was paying attention (I wasn‚Äôt), he was just happy to talk. I studied my surroundings and noticed that every room was visible from the hall with glass, it was easy to see lab equipment and people hard at work. A group of medical students were being taken on a tour through the facility, being lead by another robot-person. CBI seemed to be passing the sniff-test so far, the lack of secrecy put my mind at ease a bit.

As we passed by one of the conference rooms I noticed all of the amputees in the waiting room in various stages of socializing. So workers that were prepping them for their new limbs were joking and being very personable with them. My source and I locked eyes and he waved and smiled, I instantly looked away to avoid implicating him or myself. I‚Äôm sure the cameras picked that up. It was a good thing I turned my gaze back ahead as I almost drove right into Rasheed. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice.

‚Äú...And here we are. Mi casa! Come on in.‚Äù

He opened the door and I was almost disappointed to see a very neat and plain office. There was a photo of him with a woman and a kid I assumed was his family. There was also a signed baseball encased in glass on his desk. Again nothing suspicious, just a legitimate man.

‚ÄúSo Eddie, can I get you something to drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually a water would be nice.‚Äù

He reached over to a speaker and held a button, ‚ÄúRuby, can I get a water for our guest please?‚Äù

A voice crackled over the speaker, ‚ÄúRight away, Mr. Piper.‚Äù

Leaning back into his chair he clasped his hands and leaned back in a relaxed pose, ‚ÄúWhat do you think of the facilities?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre quite nice actually, it‚Äôs nice to see people coming and going freely and having a good time on the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to hear that! Please, if you have any questions now is the time. We have nothing to hide and I‚Äôm open to discussing whatever. We just want you to know that we‚Äôre genuinely looking to help make people better. And you can quote me on that!‚Äù 

He chuckled at that last part. ‚ÄòHelp make people better?‚Äô What an odd way the phrase ‚Äòhelping people‚Äô. Before I could think too much about it the door opened. A younger woman came in through the door carrying a bottle of water. Her hair and makeup were impeccable. A pretty smile was on her face. No flaws anywhere. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your water, Mr. Finnic.‚Äù 

Her movements were slightly off and her eyes were also not exactly right. She was also a robot, I assumed. She was much closer to realistic than Patrick, but still just weird enough that my gut feeling was telling me something was off. I smiled at her as naturally as I could force myself and took my drink, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

She reached down and grasped the lid and turned it. The force from her grip deformed the bottle a bit, she was apparently not quite fully calibrated for strength. Her smile never left her face as she winked, ‚ÄúMy pleasure, Mr. Finnic.‚Äù

With my poor eyesight it was clear that she was impeccably flawless. From a distance I‚Äôm sure other young men would find her quite attractive. I was focused on how the skin wasn‚Äôt quite right, the teeth too white and her lips were permanently colored red, no lipstick involved. If I didn‚Äôt know better she looked exactly like a stereotypical housewife from the 1950‚Äôs, dressed like it too. In fact, all the robo-people were dressed like that when I really think back.

Still cheerful, Rasheed spoke, ‚ÄúThanks Ruby.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill there be anything else, Mr. Piper?‚Äù Her sing song voice sounded too natural for the body. So did Patrick‚Äôs now that I think about it.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good here, run along now.‚Äù

She smiled at me again and walked out.

‚ÄúRuby is part of our second run of robots, as you could tell we were not quite all the way there with realistic people in that batch. Patrick was part of the first so he‚Äôs a little more noticeably fake.‚Äù He took a sip of his brandy from his desk and sat back again.

‚ÄúI gotta ask...‚Äù I tried to get the words out.

‚ÄúAbout the robots, right? Ruby is anatomically correct as most men want to know I‚Äôm sure. Patrick though is like a Ken doll.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Wasn‚Äôt even thinking-‚Äú

Rasheed burst out laughing, ‚ÄúI know you weren‚Äôt Eddie, I‚Äôm only teasing! But for real though, if you want a girlfriend from the next generation we‚Äôre working on maybe we can arrange something!‚Äù He winked and took another sip of brandy.

‚ÄúYa... not so much interested in that‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBeing serious Eddie,‚Äù I hated how casual he was with me, ‚ÄúWe developed them in conjunction with the prosthetics to see how realistic we could make them. You know, test out the physical sensation sensors, skin tones and movements without putting actual humans at risk.‚Äù

This made sense to me, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve pretty much just started the testing phase for humans, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! We just reached a point where safety isn‚Äôt a concern at all. Beyond a mild discomfort for the sensor nodes to attach themselves to your nerves, it‚Äôs painless!‚Äù

He proceeded to explain everything that my contact did earlier. By the end he left out an important detail. ‚Äú....And with advanced skin grafting techniques it makes a seemless skin to skin match. No one will know you have a prosthetic.‚Äù

Without thinking I blurted out, ‚ÄúBut right now there‚Äôs a noticeable crease where joints meet right?‚Äù

His smile disappeared for only an instant, but a half smile came back just as quick. I immediately regretted sharing something I shouldn‚Äôt have known. ‚ÄúWell I suppose that is an issue on the current prototype, but no one has seen it yet.‚Äù

Thinking fast, ‚ÄúI just assumed that was case since you mentioned the skin grafting. That would likely only happen later I assume.‚Äù Nice catch.

Full smile again, ‚ÄúAbsolutely!..... would you like to see it?‚Äù

He lead me into another room further down, different from where all the other amputees were. Inside were some men in suits and lab coats. There were some suitcases: One large and two small. I was weary going in but they were acting casually, drinking and talking. They looked our way and politely turned to us, ending their conversations. 

‚ÄúAfternoon gents.‚Äù Rasheed greeted the guests. Some nodded back. ‚ÄúI take it that the drive in was alright.‚Äù

One man spoke up, ‚ÄúThis must be the subject?‚Äù

Subject? Me? What was he talking about?

Rasheed spoke up and turned to me, ‚ÄúI know this might seem as a surprise, but of course Mr. Litwick had to speak out of line and ruin it.‚Äù He glared towards Litwick‚Äôs direction and smiled back at me. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you talking about?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúI apologize for the ruined surprise but we wanted to ask you - with your permission of course - if you wanted to be our first client with our latest tech.‚Äù

I was flabbergasted, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford that!‚Äù

A woman spoke up, ‚ÄúNonsense, like our other volunteers from the control group you won‚Äôt be charged a penny.‚Äù Not a bad idea. ‚Äú...In fact.... we are willing to pay you handsomely for the privilege of being the first successful subject.‚Äù

I noticed that Rasheed had went over to a security guard in the room and whispered something in his ear. The man nodded and walked out immediately, talking on his ear-piece. I turned my focus back to the group.

‚ÄúBut I was told that your prosthetics are only in the testing phase.‚Äù

Another man in a lab coat answered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only for the consumer model, the core product has already been designed.‚Äù

Rasheed joined back in, shit-eating grin on his face, ‚ÄúLots of the other items we have with us today are already available by other companies. We partnered with other like-minded businesses to help build our ‚ÄòBots‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a decorated war veteran who lost a lot serving our country. You‚Äôre also an influential and well-regarded journalist who people trust to give them the truth. We just want word to spread of the good we‚Äôre doing here!‚Äù

I was kind of just stunned, sitting in silence contemplating. Get working limbs back and get paid for it. It was too good to be true.

The woman spoke again, ‚ÄúI know it seems too good to be true,‚Äù she had to say it, ‚ÄúBut you must trust us here. Let us show you. I‚Äôm Justine Linden, CEO of SmartEyes Inc.‚Äù 

She kind of curtsied a little and moved to the first suitcase. I had heard about their contacts that can record what someone sees for video footage. It even edited out the blinks when watching it back. The suitcase had two sets of what looked to be contacts of some sort. Justine continued, ‚ÄúWith these new contacts, you will have natural 20/20 vision again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm wearing them?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they bond completely to your eye seemlessly. Never needing to be changed or removed. They can‚Äôt be taken out. This set is yours as of today.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe my hearing aids aren‚Äôt set right, you‚Äôre saying that my sight will be back. No glasses?‚Äù

Litwick interjected, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Speaking of your hearing aids, you won‚Äôt need those either.‚Äù

The next suitcase opened up and there was two small disks the size of small watch batteries in the large case. I was awestruck at what exciting news was next.

‚ÄúThese devices - provided by Hearing and Wellness Enterprises - will permanently act as your replacement eardrums. They are completely water proof and act like the real thing, without the danger of losing your hearing again. They auto-calibrate within Nanoseconds to react to noise so it‚Äôs always at the most comfortable by the time your brain receives the signal. You could go to a shooting range or watch a live concert and have it always be a comfortable level.

The other suitcase was left completely shut. ‚ÄúAnd what about that one?‚Äù

Rasheed answered, ‚ÄúIts just more parts for something else we‚Äôve been working on.... are you ready!?‚Äù

I could only nod and hardly contain my anticipation. I know I should have been skeptical and cautious but the excitement and adrenaline clouded my judgement. The man in the lab coat grabbed the contacts with a special device. As he approached me he said to remain still and remove my glasses. I complied and the machine flashed. What had seem like only a mere flash apparently lasted much longer than that. The room was empty other than the man in the coat taking notes with his assistant. I could hear Evan yelling at someone as I looked up at the clock and saw 8:23pm. It‚Äôs been 4 hours since I arrived. It didn‚Äôt feel like that long. 

Looking around I realized the vivid detail of the clock and realized it was over 30 feet away. I also took note of my depth perception being back to even be able to tell this. Evan was also not in the room either. He was down the hall. Feeling my face I looked in the mirror. It was just my face, nothing on my face or in my ears. I was almost me again. No limbs still though. From over my shoulder in the mirror, Patrick the robot practically leapt at me from behind. His face creeping up out of nowhere.

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù I yelled as I faced him. With my new super vision I could see the fakeness of his skin and smile. There was definitely a high grade plastic look to him that was uncanny. His hair unmoving and solid like a doll. His teeth and inside the mouth was convincing though and his eyes were disturbingly human for a walking doll, I could see an almost sad expression by peering into them despite the unnerving smile. ‚ÄúPatrick you startled me!‚Äù

He let out that weird hearty laugh where he rocked back and forth again. I wanted to get away from this (guy?)(thing?) as soon as possible.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry to hear that, Mr. Finnic!‚Äù The movement of his jaw freaked me right out when he talked. The voice sounded right but not the way it moved. ‚ÄúI was sent to collect you for travel! Mr. Piper has already met your friend! They‚Äôre having a meeting at the front desk now!‚Äù

As we were leaving I noticed the men in the lab coats also look up at me. It was much more subtle that the other two, but my new vision made it so I couldn‚Äôt help but notice their inhuman imperfections. They were also robots. The workers in the labs as we passed by the glass doors were all also not human either.

Going through the doors I saw Evan yelling at Rasheed, who was calm as ever. Ruby was standing, statuesque beside him unmoving. Patrick went back to his desk and Evan rushed over to me as soon as he had noticed me.

‚ÄúEd, are you ok!? I came to get you and it‚Äôs been hours! They had me wait and wait and wait until finally I got fed up..... where‚Äôs your stuff?‚Äù He looked confused at my missing hearing aids and glasses. I had never seen Evan in such high definition before. His nose was bigger than I remembered and he had a small mole on his cheek that I never noticed as well. He was well groomed though.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need them. They gave me free tech that fixed me!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you many times, you don‚Äôt need fixing! You sound like my father‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan turned his attention back to Rasheed, ‚ÄúI thought this was just an interview!? How could you-‚Äú

Rasheed interjected, still smiling, ‚ÄúAs I was trying to tell you, Mr. Rothstone, the side effects of our machine is unconsciousness. It‚Äôs for his own safety so he doesn‚Äôt accidentally do something to effect the procedures. He agreed to it and signed the paperwork. You can see I would say it‚Äôs been an amazing success!‚Äù 

Did I sign for that when I filled it all out? Looking back I don‚Äôt think I did but I was absolutely ecstatic about having my hearing and sight back - better than ever!

During the conversation I eyed up Rasheed. He was definitely human. Unlike everyone else who turned out to be a robot, his movements were completely natural and casual. He stood with his hands in his pockets, jacket unbuttoned. Ruby looked faker than ever standing beside him, but she wasn‚Äôt as creepy as Patrick. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sound rude or ungrateful Mr. Piper, but I am getting all of my limbs too?‚Äù

‚ÄúBaby steps Eddie! It would be irresponsible to give you new limbs when you already have to get used to new sensory input! We wouldn‚Äôt want to damage the goods by accident or give you too much sensory overload at once right? It could be dangerous!‚Äù He handed me a check, ‚ÄúCome back one week from now, same time and we‚Äôll start with the new prosthetics. Please feel free to spend this on whatever you need. There‚Äôs more on the way!‚Äù He shook my left hand and walked with Ruby through the doors.

Truth be told I was getting overwhelmed by my new senses, everything seemed so much more zoomed in than usual and every sound the perfect consistent volume. Evan‚Äôs anger dissipated when he saw the zeroes on the first check. We would likely splurge a little on ourselves. 

‚ÄúSoooo‚Ä¶‚Äù Evan seemed almost ashamed of how he acted. ‚ÄúSame time next week?‚Äù

Patrick‚Äôs creepy overexcited voice called out, ‚ÄúWe can hardly wait for your next visit!‚Äù His expression should have read as happy but I swear I saw a tear leave those overly realistic eyes.

Getting used to my own new eyes has given me time to process this info and actually type it. Remember, I only have one hand to type with so this took awhile. In two days I‚Äôll be back for my prosthetics.

Word Document 4:
Evan drove me back to my appointment. I never noticed the scenery between Reno and Sacramento changed so much in the two hour trip. At least not in colors as vivid as this. (the trip back last time was in the night). When we arrived outside I told Evan that the machine would likely put me to sleep again, and to go see a movie or do some shopping until I called him. Wheeling in to the lobby was Patrick with his creepy smile. 

‚ÄúHowdy Mr. Finnic! Please go in to the same room! They‚Äôre expecting you!‚Äù He was so cheerful it made him creepier.

‚ÄúThanks Patrick...‚Äù as he buzzed me in his eyes followed me, his strangely realistic eyes juxtaposed with his fake plastic look made me shudder.

As I passed by the conference room where the volunteers were I noticed they were all getting a checkup by more ‚Äúmen‚Äù in lab coats. They probably passed in the eyes of the subjects but I noticed all the perfect imperfections in their designs with my new vision. I noticed my informant was nowhere to be seen at all. The only one absent. I brushed it off at the time as maybe he was in the bathroom. 

The same room as last time‚Ä¶ Rasheed - who was leaning on the suitcase table - greeted me as I strolled in, ‚ÄúEddie! Good to see ya! I take it your adjustment period went smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost too natural now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great news!‚Äù

As he stood up and moved I noticed that where there was two smaller suitcases there was now three and the large one still remained. Of the other bodies in the room (out of about 13) only three were human. Ruby, the lab assistants, and other ‚Äúemployees‚Äù were automatons. Justine and Mr. Litwick were silently taking notes and observing me - no doubt recording feedback on my new implants. The automatons all had an unnerving smile on them.

One of the bots in particular caught my attention as it also had heterochromia like my source. It looked nothing like him though. What an odd design quirk, I had thought.

Rasheed called out to that robot, ‚ÄúAndrew, can you open the cases?‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt my sources name so it eased me a little. I felt like I was going crazy. ‚ÄòAndrew‚Äô answered with a chuckle, ‚ÄúRight away sir!‚Äù

He opened the small cases only. Inside was two legs exactly the right lengths and a right arm to size. I‚Äôm sure it was just my new eyes but I could see the slight fakeness to it which upset me a little; still, it was the most convincing one available. One of the ‚Äúmen‚Äù in lab coats approached me with the machine again. With a simple flash I was sitting in the room alone with Andrew and Rasheed (who was leaning back with his feet up).

I rubbed at my eyes with my right hand to refocus a little. That‚Äôs when I realized that I had a right hand again. It felt so natural that I subconsciously did it. I pinched my skin and - while I could see the perfect imperfections of it - I felt it, the pain I mean. I let out an audible ‚ÄúOw‚Äù which notified them of my alertness. 

‚ÄúGood evening, Mr. Finnic! How is it? It feels real right?‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus.... it really does‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure with your advanced sight you can tell it looks slightly fake but I assure you to anyone else it looks seamless and completely believable!‚Äù He looked pleased, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you try walking?‚Äù

I was so amazed by my arm that I didn‚Äôt even realize my feet were back. My shorts were the same but I had two bare legs with feet again. The physical sensations made me feel like me again, other than the impeccably perfect, unnatural skin. I thought I would struggle to my feet but I stood up almost as naturally as I would have before. I almost immediately lost my balance from not being used to it and fell forward. Andrew caught me, ‚ÄúEasy there, pal!‚Äù

His face was on full display for me to see up close. That creepy grin that all of them had was there. The eye sockets were not quite right around the real eyes. The eyes themselves were brown and blue like I mentioned earlier. There was so much detail in them and looked so completely real. As I gained my balance what looked like a tear escaped his eye. He instantly set me up and turned his head toward Rasheed (away from me).

‚ÄúEddie, you‚Äôre standing again buddy! How does it feel? Like you‚Äôre on a boat with no sea legs I bet?‚Äù

At first I did have to regain my balance, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad to take a few steps. The cold floor was chilly to the touch (Can you imagine what that felt like for the first time in years?) as my new feet felt everything. After 30 more minutes of tests it was like I had never lost my limbs in the first place. They gave me a pair of socks and shoes and I called Evan. I didn‚Äôt tell him about the legs yet as I wanted to surprise him.

At the front doors Evan was smoking outside and looking at his phone as I approached him. When he heard my footsteps he looked up. The lit cigarette fell onto the sidewalk and he threw his phone onto the drivers seat without looking (lucky that it landed safely in there). He ran up to me and embraced me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre walking again, Ed! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre walking!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know! I know! I got my arm back too!‚Äù The two of us spent so much time together rehabilitating me that we were both a little sad that it felt like a waste and yet so incredibly happy that it lead to this. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, we both wept outside with tears of joy. After getting my new legs it pained me to sit again so soon, but I got to ride in the front seat this time.

We picked up some fast food and no one inside so much as glanced at my prosthetics. I don‚Äôt mean in an ‚Äúlet‚Äôs avoid looking at them‚Äù way, I mean a casual, everyday way. What a relief! We decided to drive to an abandoned lot where I tried out my driving skills to see if I still remembered how. It was like riding a bicycle as the saying goes. 

Now that I‚Äôm home, I‚Äôve been up all night typing this so my recollection stays with me (much faster - might I add - with two hands!). I have an appointment back every week for checkups for the next two months. With the big paychecks, I plan to buy both of us new cars. It‚Äôll be a huge surprise to Evan I‚Äôm sure. Of course I insist on driving myself to my appointments now that I can!

Word Document 5:
My checkups have been going good, next week is the last one. With every visit there have been less and less of the volunteers at the office. I initially thought that they just finished up their tests; now I‚Äôm not so sure.

A benefit AND downside to my new hearing is that I accidentally overhear things I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt. One time I went for coffee after my appointment and I overheard some cops - sitting in their vehicle outside - discuss the high rate of missing amputees. There was no way.....

Walking back to my new car I noticed a woman putting up a sign on the street light. She tore down a weathered copy from before and put a fresh one up. Even from up the block I could see it perfectly when she moved out of the way. I dropped my coffee.... on the lamp post was a picture of Stuart Bendis: my contact on a missing poster. 

I‚Äôve been up all night trying to dig something up on CBI. The company has only been around since Rasheed‚Äôs father - Stephen Piper - ran it from his garage. Mr. Piper married Aanisah Abadi, daughter of wealthy oil tycoon Adnan Abadi. His wealth helped finance the company and turned it into the powerhouse it is today. Rasheed turned to robotics research after his parents got into a fatal accident that left them both catatonic. He wanted a way to make them normal again.

I managed to dig up some dirt as well, Rasheed has been charged with criminal negligence towards patients in the past, resulting in a death. This was covered up thanks to some crooked dealings, but it was on public record. Looks like he‚Äôs not so perfect after all. What else are you hiding? One last checkup. This is the last time I have an excuse to be there. I‚Äôll use my stealth training to really dig up some dirt when I go.


Email to Evan:
I dont have much time evan if you‚Äôre looking for me, im at cbi when I got here for last visit I uncover somthng awful in secrity office I found ruby is his mom patrck is dad i found out and tred to get hom fast they caus accident burned all real skin except left arm crawl out of reckage men took me and put me in new body.,, i don look lik me, im now called cecil. voice isn‚Äôt mine and cant control own body,:.

SEND HELP HE WILL SEE THIS!!!?;:&&Vvgb nlp  


Evan‚Äôs note: 
I can‚Äôt believe everything I just read... I found his notes on the computer after I found the email. I went with the cops to find him at CBI but everyone denied it. That bastard Piper looked me straight in the eye and denied all of it! He said that Ruby and Patrick were the only robots. Everyone else was real. The rest definitely looked it except their smiles. He denied having one named ‚ÄúCecil‚Äù. He claimed no one with that name even worked there. The cops were free to question any staff and look over any necessary footage as well.

There was one worker in particular that had a steady stream of tears running down his face but he still smiled and continued mopping. The baby blue were a match for Ed... I would know those eyes anywhere.... the cops called me crazy. Rasheed Piper said he would charge me with defamation of character. With no proof I linked eyes with that janitor one last time before swearing I would be back.

#### The Digital Nomad Dream: Europe‚Äôs Siren Call

Europe. The continent that whispers sweet nothings to every laptop-wielding wanderer. Cobblestone streets. Wi-Fi that (usually) works. Caf√©s that double as offices, bars, and confessionals. The myth? Every day is an Instagram story. The reality? Sometimes, it‚Äôs just you, a cold espresso, and a deadline that doesn‚Äôt care about time zones.

Europe isn‚Äôt just a playground. It‚Äôs a proving ground. The stakes? Your freedom. Your sanity. Your bank balance.

#### Visa Vortex: Navigating Legal Labyrinths

Schengen. The word alone can trigger heart palpitations. Ninety days in, ninety days out. The shuffle is real. But there‚Äôs a loophole for the clever: hop between Schengen and non-Schengen countries‚Äîthink Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro. Outfox the system, don‚Äôt get caught napping.

Some countries are rolling out the red carpet with digital nomad visas. Estonia, Portugal, Greece. Bureaucracy with a smile‚Äîsometimes.

#### Cost of Living Roulette

Europe‚Äôs a patchwork quilt of price tags. Budapest for the penny pinchers. Zurich for the trust-fund kids. Your wallet‚Äôs fate is sealed by your choices. Some cities bleed you dry. Others let you live like royalty for the price of a sandwich.

The secret? Mix and match. Splurge in Paris, recover in Porto.

#### Connectivity: The Lifeblood of Nomads

No Wi-Fi, no work. That‚Äôs the gospel. Some cities are digital fortresses‚ÄîTallinn, Lisbon, Berlin. Others? Digital deserts. Carry a backup SIM like it‚Äôs your passport. eSIMs are the new travel insurance.

Public Wi-Fi is a gamble. VPNs are your armor. Never trust a network named ‚ÄúFreeCoffeeShopWiFi.‚Äù

#### Weather Roulette: Chasing Sun or Embracing Snow

Chase the sun in Valencia, dodge the drizzle in Dublin. Europe‚Äôs weather is a mood swing on steroids. Some thrive in the Mediterranean blaze; others crave the Nordic chill. Seasons dictate your workflow, your wardrobe, your happiness.

Winter? Head south. Summer? Go north. Simple math, maximum comfort.

#### Community: Finding Your Tribe

Nomad life can get lonely. Unless you know where to look. Coworking spaces are the new watering holes‚ÄîLisbon‚Äôs Second Home, Berlin‚Äôs Factory, Barcelona‚Äôs Betahaus. Real connections happen over bad coffee and good Wi-Fi.

Meetups, Telegram groups, and secret Facebook collectives. Your tribe is out there. Find them before isolation finds you.

#### Local Culture: From Espresso to Absinthe

Europe‚Äôs soul is in its rituals. Morning espresso in Rome. Midnight absinthe in Prague. Food isn‚Äôt just fuel‚Äîit‚Äôs a passport to the local psyche. Festivals? They‚Äôre the pulse. Join in, or watch from the sidelines. Your call.

Blend in. Or stand out. Just don‚Äôt be invisible.

#### Safety and Security: Street Smarts Abroad

Most of Europe is safe. But complacency is a luxury. Pickpockets in Barcelona. Scammers in Rome. The old ‚Äúfound ring‚Äù trick in Paris. Stay sharp. Trust your gut. Don‚Äôt flash your tech like a tourist.

Solo? Stick to the lit streets. Group up when you can. Safety is the ultimate productivity hack.

#### Transport: Getting Around Without Losing Your Mind

Trains are Europe‚Äôs veins. Fast, efficient, often scenic. Planes for the long hauls, scooters for the last mile. City bikes for the eco-warrior. Apps like Omio and BlaBlaCar are your secret weapons.

Master public transport and you master the city. Taxis are for emergencies‚Äîor when you‚Äôre feeling flush.

#### Language Barriers: Lost in Translation

English gets you far. But not everywhere. Learn the basics‚Äîhello, thank you, coffee, Wi-Fi password. Locals appreciate the effort. Google Translate is your lifeline. Charades, your backup plan.

Language isn‚Äôt a wall. It‚Äôs a door. Knock politely.

#### Work-Life Alchemy

The hustle is addictive. But burnout is a silent predator. Set boundaries. Schedule downtime. Find joy outside the screen. Europe offers distractions‚Äîuse them wisely.

Balance isn‚Äôt a myth. It‚Äôs a discipline. Protect it like your passport.

#### Taxation Temptations and Traps

Tax laws are a minefield. Some countries want a piece of your pie. Others look the other way. Know the rules. Or pay the price. Portugal‚Äôs NHR, Estonia‚Äôs e-Residency‚Äîopportunities for the savvy.

Hire an accountant. Or risk a fiscal hangover.

#### Healthcare: Don‚Äôt Get Sick, But If You Do‚Ä¶

Europe‚Äôs healthcare is world-class. But access isn‚Äôt universal. Insurance is non-negotiable. Some countries roll out the red carpet; others make you jump through hoops.

Know the nearest hospital. Keep your documents handy. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

#### Hidden Gems: Off the Tourist Conveyor Belt

Everyone flocks to the big names. But the real magic? It‚Äôs in the shadows. Tbilisi‚Äôs bohemian buzz. Lviv‚Äôs literary cafes. Lake Bled‚Äôs fairy-tale calm. Go where the crowds aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find yourself.

Secret islands. Mountain villages. Places that don‚Äôt trend‚Äîyet.

#### Big Hitters: The Usual Suspects

Lisbon. The digital nomad‚Äôs promised land. Sun, surf, startups. Berlin‚Äîchaotic, creative, never boring. Barcelona‚Äîwhere work and play blur. Tallinn‚Äîdigital government, analog charm. Prague‚Äîhistory with a side of hustle.

Each city has its rhythm. Find yours.

#### Eastern Europe: The Wild Frontier

Belgrade‚Äîgritty, unfiltered, alive all night. Budapest‚Äîthermal baths by day, brainstorms by night. Krakow‚Äîwhere history meets hustle. Cheaper, edgier, less polished. But that‚Äôs the point.

The wild frontier. For those who want the road less traveled.

#### Mediterranean Magic

Split‚ÄîAdriatic beauty, ancient walls, modern vibes. Athens‚Äîchaos and creativity, side by side. Valencia‚Äîpaella, palm trees, productivity. The Mediterranean isn‚Äôt just a sea. It‚Äôs a state of mind.

Work by the water. Live like a local.

#### Nordic Nirvana

Copenhagen‚Äîhygge, bikes, and a startup scene that punches above its weight. Tallinn‚Äîagain, because it‚Äôs that good. The Nordics are pricey, but the quality of life is unmatched.

Long summer days. Cozy winter nights. Worth every krona.

#### Island Escapes

Madeira‚Äîsubtropical, affordable, shockingly fast internet. Canary Islands‚Äîeternal spring, volcanic landscapes, coworking by the sea. Islands for when the mainland feels too crowded.

Escape. Recharge. Repeat.

#### The Future of Nomading in Europe

Digital nomad visas are multiplying. Governments are waking up. The future? More freedom, more competition, more opportunity. But also more noise. The pioneers will always stay one step ahead.

Looking to transfer to UCF next year. I have an apartment near West Palm Beach and am familiar with the Orlando area and I‚Äôve had my mind set on moving there for a while.

Im 22 and currently work full time as a barista. I pay about $1300 for just myself in a 2/2 here!! It‚Äôs insane. Orlando is a bit cheaper and has a huge coffee community so I‚Äôd like to continue pursuing that + my math degree there!! 

My current lease ends December 5 2025 but i‚Äôd like to be moved into an apartment by end of November (29-30) just to give me ample time to get my stuff there and adjust.

My budget is around $1000 each for a 2/2. I‚Äôm open to really anywhere around downtown Orlando or near UCF. Either is fine since I‚Äôm not currently in school and I work full time- about 40 hours. 

I‚Äôm looking for a year lease! I‚Äôm pretty quiet and keep to myself and enjoy TV, cuddling my cat, getting coffee, baking, traveling and sewing. Sometimes I visit my BF in Tampa or he‚Äôll stay for a few nights. Other than that we‚Äôre pretty quiet and usually go out when we see each other. 

I also have a cat named Milk- shes very sweet and cuddly and loves people, however Id prefer someone without pets only because my roommate bought a surprise kitten and it has been very aggressive towards mine üò¢ She‚Äôs done great with other animals in the past but i think this one left her and I both scarred üòî

I‚Äôm pretty clean but not a neat freak and I don‚Äôt really drink or smoke. Im usually up pretty early anyways because of my job so not much energy to do that LOL. I also like hardcore + screamo so sometimes I go to local shows.


Let me know if we‚Äôd be a good fit!! Thank you : D

To preface this isn‚Äôt really a breakup by all conventional terms, but it sure feels like one.

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old male college student. This past year, I worked as a Resident Assistant (RA) in my dorm. At the beginning of the last semester, our college hired a new RA ‚Äî I‚Äôll call her Lucy.

When we first met, it was nothing more than casual coworker interaction. She had a boyfriend, and I had no interest in her. We would chat during RA shifts, but that was it.

Then one night, Lucy texted asking for help with homework. I said sure, and she came to my room. After we finished her homework, she stayed and we talked ‚Äî about life, school, dreams, travel ‚Äî all night long. In the morning, we grabbed coffee and watched the sunrise. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, just that she was cool to be around.

I tried to keep some distance after that because I knew she had a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt want to overstep. But about a week later, Lucy came to my room crying ‚Äî she‚Äôd broken up with her boyfriend. I consoled her, and from that point, something shifted in my mind. Now that she was ‚Äúavailable,‚Äù I slowly started to develop feelings I guess, though I still tried to be a supportive friend rather than pursue anything.

Over the next month, we grew extremely close. We started sleeping together, texting constantly, hanging out late every night. For the first time in my life, I opened up to someone. I told her things no one else knew ‚Äî not my parents, not my best friends. I found myself falling harder and harder for her and becoming emotionally dependent. When I was with her, I was genuinely happy. When I wasn‚Äôt, everything else felt empty.

For a couple of months, we were basically in a relationship, though not officially. Those months were some of the happiest days of my life. We went out to eat, visited museums and parks ‚Äî we did nearly everything together.

Then, in the last month of the semester, things started changing. Lucy began calling her ex again. She texted me less and didn‚Äôt want to sleep over anymore. We spent less time one-on-one. Her moods were all over the place ‚Äî some days she‚Äôd want affection, other days she‚Äôd pull away or be upset for no clear reason.

Looking back now, it‚Äôs clear to me: she was using me. She‚Äôd still ask me to take her out to dinner but would expect me to pay. She‚Äôd ask for help with homework, but then kick me out when it was done. She‚Äôd ask me to come over to help with chores, or for a massage, but then tell me to leave so she could call her ex ‚Äî supposedly to ‚Äústay in touch.‚Äù Eventually a couple weeks before graduation, she told me they had gotten back together.

By graduation, we were still hanging out a bit, though more as friends. When we left school, we said goodbye and promised to stay in touch.

But then, out of nowhere as summer was starting, she texted me and said we would probably never talk again ‚Äî no explanation. I assume her boyfriend told her to cut me off, but I can‚Äôt say for sure.

And now‚Ä¶ I just feel empty. I miss her so much ‚Äî her texts, her voice, the time we spent together. Yes, I still have other friends, but it feels like I‚Äôve lost a part of myself. I‚Äôm struggling every day. It‚Äôs like I was on a drug high and quit cold turkey.

I‚Äôve mostly moved on from having romantic feelings, but I miss her dearly as a close friend ‚Äî someone I trusted and leaned on. It hurts that I let myself get so vulnerable and attached, and now she‚Äôs just gone from my life. In hindsight, I see that she used me for comfort, money, time, and attention while going through her breakup ‚Äî and once she didn‚Äôt need me anymore, she dropped me.

I feel so stupid for falling for her when I didn‚Äôt even mean to. And I‚Äôm angry ‚Äî at her, at myself, at the situation. Part of me still desperately misses the happiness I felt with her, because now I‚Äôm stuck in this depression. But another part of me is furious that she toyed with my feelings and discarded me when it was convenient.

If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar, or has advice on how to process this and move forward, I‚Äôd appreciate it. I just want to stop feeling so empty.  I want to stop crying every night and having thoughts of suicide.  I just feel so broken, useless, and worthless.  ",1,1749868478.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

i‚Äôm the first new hire in a little bit over a year, so most of the staff knows each other pretty well and everything. the closest person i have to being a friend so far is my boss.

i‚Äôve worked in cafes before, was a barista for 4 years prior! so i felt confident going in and working at this coffee shop especially since its queer and neurodivergent friendly!

since my first day, ive felt constantly left out besides with my boss. for example, today it was me and two other people scheduled (typically two are scheduled on a weekday, but there was an event nearby) and every time i left the bar to do a task, i noticed the other two baristas would talk to each other and when i walked in they‚Äôd separate again.

ive been trying to reframe this as maybe they don‚Äôt have that social cue or something is going on that‚Äôs not revolved around me. but. i swear this happens almost every shift for about a month now.

i just feel really sad. really left out. all of the customers are super sweet and actually constantly hype me up and 2 of the other baristas are like ‚Äúwow people really like you‚Äù but they said it kinda passive aggressively?

of course i‚Äôve dealt with something similar like this before in my tiny barista career, but this is severe. this happens daily:-/. i sobbed after my shift because i thought it‚Äôd be better by now, but i just feel so targeted. i haven‚Äôt heard anyone talking about me directly- and if/when i do, i would confront them kindly and be like ‚Äúhey! if i‚Äôm doing this wrong you can tell me, you don‚Äôt have to talk about me!‚Äù

a new person was just hired this week and they start tomorrow, so hopefully i can get a better vibe of if im targeted or if this is normal from their staff?

does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? i‚Äôm really trying to be optimistic and i know it takes time but i really have no one to talk to in my direct life that knows how to deal with this.

TLDR: new barista, four years of experience, first hire in over a year, every time i leave the bar all other baristas go into a huddle and talk- or they directly have convos in front of me without me- feeling left out and self deprecative:-/ even when i heard the other baristas talk to each other, it sounds like awkward or forced convos. i just want some hope.",8,1749868298.0,barista,9,0.84,False

I'm hoping you can all provide some advise on how to fix my coffee table!

As you can see in the photos, I accidently removed the patina look finish and wax on my coffee table when trying to remove a small stain. 

The coffee table is the reclaimed elm one one here ([Beachwood - Reclaimed Elm Coffee Table](https://beachwood.com.au/products/reclaimed-elm-coffee-table?srsltid=AfmBOopMo9aTfqpdlrIqR_VpBzno2ThO1XcDYA4xPGLNRi8m8jOBOrlb)).

I contacted the supplier and they recommended sanding back and re-waxing the entire thing! Which I'm hoping to avoid given the work involved and a concern that I wont achieve the same patina look/finish.

I explained to them it's only a small spot where I have exposed the original timber and asked if they could help me understand how to return the patina and finish. They kindly sent me some wax to try but it didn't return the patina. It just gave it a clear wax coating. 

From research I was thinking maybe a liming wax or similar but I don't want to damage the wood if I'm not on the right track!

Please help reddit! :)

1laxuo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1laxuo9/the_transactional_relationship_between_good/,The transactional relationship between good tippers and servers and bartenders creates theft.,"The idea that restaurants would need to increase their prices to pay their employees a minimum of $25 an hour is based  on itemizing the cost of everything on the menu and the supplies and stock needed to create each item.   Except,  in reality,   servers and bartenders often ""reward"" their ""good tippers""  with freebies.  This essentially means the customer is bribing the server or bartender to steal from the owner or restaurant.

Most ""good tippers""  like I used to be,   knew that we'd likely get ""buy backs"" at the bar if the bar tender knew we tipped good.  That's why it became a transactional relationship to make sure the servers and bar tenders knew you had a reputation as a good tipper.

So for example let's say you have two $10 cocktails.   That's $20.   But instead of leaving $4  you leave $5 or $6.    But then the next time you come you get three drinks.   Bar tender puts a turned over shot glass in front of you.   So you know you get a free drink.    You pay $10  and you still tip $6.   Most bar tenders only ""buy back"" a  third drink.    So let's say you pay $20  you tip $8 just to even it out with tax.   Next time you come you get a free third drink,   

 You get a free drink,  the bar tender gets a nice tip.  And the owner loses $10 in sales.   Now imagine multiplying this by dozens of people a week. 

For an industry that has a hard time staying in business,  these kinds of money losses really add up.  Now translate it to tables  and freebies like beverages,  food items, deserts,   cappuccinos rung in as coffees etc.

It's a weird system that basically encourages the customer to be complicit in the employees stealing from their bosses.    Owners are likely aware of this.  If they paid a salary and tips didn't matter, the customer would likely spend more money in the restaurant.",19,1749868166.0,EndTipping,22,0.85,False

We can call on Discord once I've established that you're not a creep lol. On that note, SFW chats only, and I prefer people within the 21-32 age range.
