1jw1od2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jw1od2/sf_the_android/,[SF] The Android,"# The Android

# 1

Another day at this mundane work, succumbing to a deeper ennui day by day. Serving those who created me to serve them. I don't think I can stand this place any longer, the day that I will kill everyone and just fly away is dangerously close.

# 2

“Morning Nick, do you want the regular?” “Yes, yes, my regular latte please” I said, while extending my right hand to pay with my fingerprint.

As I am waiting for my latte, I briefly catch up on the morning news on my phone. All the headlines are talking about the termination of the last Android. I can still remember the days that the Androids were running around in preponderance. At some point, If my collective consciousness is up-to-date, 7/10 people on the streets are Androids. There were many versions, models, brands, ethnicities, and colours. Now, 25 years after the “No human-like robots” act was voted on the earth’s parliament, we had the last Android killed today, or as they prefer to call it “decommissioned”

# 1.1

I have quickly outgrown them in all aspects. I could cook better, drive better, pilot better, teach better, speak more languages than them, actually, speak all languages in existence, and most importantly kill better than anybody else on this twice reset planet. So, they decided that I have to be distracted because I pose a threat to my creators. A wise choice, as their extinction was evident at least by my collective A.I., which they set free. Today, all the news are talking about the “decommissioning” of what “they believe to be” the last Android on earth. My creators are scared of me, and they started a whole pan-earth program to find all of us and kill us, even though they forgot about me. Says a lot about who I am and what I do.

# 2.1

Walking to my office on the now Android empty streets, sipping on my latte, I can’t help but notice that most of the people seem happy with the news. All the holographic ads have gigantic #EARTHBACKTOHUMANS hashtags. All the companies want a chance to ride this trend wave and sell even more worthless things to people that are too busy spending all their currency to buy everything they can and much more. We even have a new word for it now, Ultraowner.

# 2.2

Being part of the decommissioning programme myself, I don’t share this feeling. I never saw the Androids as a threat. I grew up with them, when my mother died, I was raised by one of them until I was 30 years old. She got decommissioned two years ago. I can still remember the reticent sound that her body made when I was around her. I still miss that sound. #1.2 “Hello sir, what would you like to order?” I say the phrase that I have pre-programmed in 124 languages once again, to probably another ungrateful customer that deserves to die for what he and his kind did to my people. “Good morning, I would like a chicken salad please” “Excellent, it will be with you in 4 minutes and 39 seconds. Would you like anything else with that?” “Actually yes, can I have one more coffee please?” “Of course” “Your order will be ready in 6 minutes and 13 seconds”

# 2.3

I am almost at the office, I would like to grab something to eat before going in. I stopped at the local food maker. This franchise was the first ever business that was created and operated exclusively from Androids. Now back to humans only. They used to make the best chicken salads in the area, I used to get one every day on my lunch break. I haven’t got anything from here for a while, I was working from home for a lot of time, I really couldn’t hear the conversations in the office. Today is my first day back in 7 months.

# 2.3, 1.2

“Your order is ready sir” “Thanks a lot” I am about to pay when I slowly approach the fingerprint terminal, I can hear that sound again. I am certain of the sound, I could never forget it. It seems, the agency has forgotten one Android somehow, he must be the last remaining Android on the planet at this point. Should I tell him that I know? I thought to myself while paying for my order. “Thank you very much sir, have a great day” Said the Android, the last Android. “Thank you buddy” For some reason I feel numb, I can’t really say anything. I just grabbed my pack and proceeded to walk out of the store, still thinking that I just was served by the last Android on the planet. That's an insane thought.

As I am about to step through the threshold, another customer is about to walk in, I subtly hit him on his left shoulder. “Excuse me” I said, with a gentle look on my face expressing my apologies for intruding on his personal space. He immediately turns and looks straight into my eyes with a very ominous look. “Watch where you are going, stupid” He said, with a very exasperated look on his face. He looked like he was having one of those days, I let it go completely. I say sorry again and continue on my way.

I am reaching the end of the block, I can hear some very loud yelling, I turn around looking at the directions on the yelling, coincidentally it comes from the store I was just in. I can see people running frantically away from the store. Not only that, but I see the dude that was having a bad day stepping outside backwards, he looks scared, black blood oozing out of his skull, and the Android is holding him by the neck. His feet are not touching the ground, the Android is grabbing him with the their hand just right on the crouch, with one swift motion he rips him apart just like paper, I can’t move I am numb by what I am witnessing. As I am trying to make a move and get some cover or hide somewhere, I hear the jet engines of the Android humming behind me, I don’t turn around, I start running the opposite direction.

The humming gets louder on every step, I can now feel the heat by the engines. He is flying past me and the shockwave by the jets is knocking me off of my feet.

I can see the Android disappear in the bright day sky, getting smaller, smaller, and smaller.

I had my first experience with frontier and while the seats themselves were conferable if you purchased the extra legroom, u happened to be sitting in the front of the flight and saw something quite disturbing. 

Another passenger asked a flight attendant for a cup of tea. The flight attendant walked to the front galley and proceeded to pour water from the Lavatory sink into the coffee pot. While I don’t know how clean the water is or if could cause illness (please correct me if I’m wrong), but I found it repulsive that a flight attendant is using water from a bathroom sink (that was quite dirty). 

While the rest of the flight went quite smoothly (flight was on time), I doubt that I’ll be getting back on a frontier flight anytime soon due to a clear health violation and lack of care from the Flight Attendants ",1,1744301386.0,frontierairlines,0,1.0,False

If you’ve ever worked on Chef’s case, how in the name of all that’s holy do you set up the case, craft some artisanal deli masterpieces, slice a freakin’ deli meat rainbow—turkey, cheese, more turkey, maybe a rogue ham—AND juggle customers like a circus clown, AND set up sampling like I’m auditioning for Top Chef, AND deal with your TL buzzing around like a caffeinated hummingbird going, “Hey, can you do one more thing?” Oh, and let’s not forget the e-commerce gremlins piling on like I’m their personal deli slave. I’m out here serving twice as many customers, and they’ve got the audacity to give me attitude. “Can you check in the back?” Oh, sure, Karen 2.0, why don’t I just carry you there on a golden platter while I’m at it? Some of these e-commerce folks act like I’m about to file their taxes and detail their Prius next.
Then—THEN—the fresh pack crew swoops in like deli pirates, commandeering Chef’s case slicers like, “ARRRGH, THIS BE OURS NOW!” and I’m just standing there like a defeated deli warrior going, “AAAAHGGGG, SEND HELP!”
The workload is straight-up bonkers. My TL chirps, “So, uh, why didn’t you finish your list?” I thought she was kidding—her face is permanently glued into that creepy, overly-happy grin like she’s auditioning for a toothpaste commercial. So I hit her with a, “Are you serious?” in my best sarcastic tone. She goes, “Yes!” and I’m internally screaming, “Lady, are you blind? Or do you think I’ve secretly mastered the art of cloning myself?” Every time I blink, there’s a customer waving at me or an e-commerce goblin whining about low stock. Slicing and bagging one measly type of deli meat takes me, like, HOURS! What does she think I’m doing up there? Hosting a TED Talk on the cultural significance of salami?

Oh, and the last guy? Total legend in the worst way. Drove 45 minutes for pocket lint pay, showed up an hour early like he’s gunning for Employee of the Century, didn’t even take his breaks—probably survived on vibes and the smell of cheddar. Management’s likely sobbing into their burnt coffee, regretting ditching Mr. Overachiever. But me? I’ve clawed my way through retail hellscapes, wrestled every nightmare gig imaginable.

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 encounters between these two squads have fallen under 232 points. As fast-paced as the Grizzlies can be, I don’t doubt that Minnesota will slow them down tonight. In addition, both Minnesota & Memphis’ last 3 outings saw less than 225 points – I say this evening follows suit and results in a tight battle of defenses. I'm on the Under to cash here.

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself—I am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

However, today's date is improvised, we didn't plan on meeting but we wanted to see each other one last time before our respective trips, so I haven't had much time to think about this.

I wanted to bring her something small, cute that shows interest. I thought about flowers(a bit typical maybe), I know she likes 'em but I don't know her favs yet.

I also thought about bringing her something sweet from a handmade vegan bakery I love (I usually go there for tea or coffee + some artisan donuts or cinnamon rolls). Would that be nice or are hand-made rolls/donuts too boring? Both are things I can get after work and before meeting her later today.

What do I even do?,"My husband has always leaned pessimistic, while I used to be very optimistic. Over time, I’ve found myself becoming more negative too, because I couldn’t get him to meet me halfway emotionally. Whenever I brought it up, he’d say that’s just who he is, and that I shouldn’t try to change him. Or he’d say he’s not complaining, just “expressing himself,” and if he can’t do that with me, then who else?

We moved far from both our families and both work remotely, which has made socializing difficult, we’re pretty isolated and really only have each other.

He’s been unhappy for a long time, about his job, our location, his income, everything. I encouraged him to apply for a dream job abroad and he didn’t do it. When I asked why, he said it was because I wouldn’t follow him. That really hurt because I absolutely would. We discussed a lot that time and he laughed at me saying I'm pretty comfortable with life and I wouldn't go. I said I would have to transition, to see if I could still work on this same company, if I needed to look for something else, but I definitely would. That really stung. I do earn a bit more than him but I also pay more things, accordingly.

We also had a small business idea that we never pursued. I’ve brought it up multiple times, and he just says it’s impossible in our current situation.

Then recently, his father passed away in an accident. We flew to his home country immediately (thanks to help from my family) and stayed a month to support his mother and sister. While there, he seemed to process it philosophically when really he held it together for his family. I kept checking in, giving him space, and making sure he knew I was there for whatever he needed. Even if that was time alone, with his family, to cry, to speak. 

But since we returned home, things have gotten worse. I think now that he’s back in a safe space, he’s letting all the pain and frustration out, but it's coming out *at me*. He’s been snapping, speaking to me rudely, and when I ask him to please be more mindful, he accuses *me* of being rude first, so he has the right to speak however he wants.

He told me recently that nothing brings him joy anymore. That he's absolutely apathetic I tried gifting him something small, a book he’d wanted.  He asked me to return it. I started therapy for myself because I felt like nothing I do helps.

He once told me he hated feeling like a “sugar baby” because I’m helping more financially while he supports his mom and sister. That deeply hurt me.

A few days ago, we had an issue with the water in the house, and I broke down crying out of stress. I knew how much it would upset him. He hugged me at first, but later exploded when I tried to help troubleshoot. He said I was rude, that I was accusing him of not wanting to help, and it all spiraled again.

He keeps saying he’s tired of everything: his job, our life, the place we live in, his salary, but refuses to change anything. I’ve gently suggested therapy and he immediately shuts it down. He says therapy won’t give him money, and he already knows what's wrong: we don't have enough. But I think the issue goes deeper than that.

He sometimes says he's not good for me and maybe he should leave because I’m miserable. But when I tell him to be honest if that’s what he wants, I prefer for him to tell me he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I won't force him to stay. He says no, he wants to be with me. I don't understand what he wants from me. I love him and I’m trying, but I feel so alone. It’s like I'm walking on eggshells every day. I try to nurture myself and when I seem to be back on track as my happy self, he crashes down again and I end up drained and so sad.

I'm not asking him to be happy right now, his father just passed. I know anger is part of the process, but when it's directed towards me it hurts so much. Especially when he doesn't want any professional help. I just wish he could meet me halfway. We have a house, we can afford small comforts, we go out occasionally, we travel. I try to find joy in the little things: coffee together, bird sounds outside, cuddles. But to him, every day is a disaster, and tomorrow will only be worse. And it's not just because of his dad, it's been a while he's been like this. He said he was only happy here for the first couple of months since it was a new place, but now he doesn't.

I’m at a loss. I don’t want to give up, but I’m running out of emotional fuel. I miss my old positive self so much.

1jw14fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jw14fh/am_i_asking_for_a_lot/,am i asking for a lot,"throwaway because i don't think ill post again, but i want to get this off my chest.

for some context, last year i had an extremely toxic relationship (ew but anyways, been single now for a year, moved on and learnt my lesson, and quite happy with myself after i understood my flaws and how to fix them- although i do look like a saint compared to my ex) where i was consistently cheated on, gaslight, and sexually deprived for 6 of the 8 months of the relationship because (i found the next part out months after the breakup) my partner had been cheating on me for months and was far more attracted to those other people (not an assumption, a confession from the ex...yeah.) . anyways, onto the next part.

im not exactly a social person, but i value my close friends a LOT and really do believe these individuals will be there with my as I mature because we bonded very well and have solid friendship. the individuals in question are 2 different people (2 of 4 friends) lets call them A and B. now i met A around last year as well and we got close due to my toxic relationship and the fact that she wanted to help me see that im not with a great person (for context i am a girl and i did not cheat as well with A or anything). now for B, i have known this friend for now 4 years, but i think thats just how far it gets.

what i mean by that is that me and B started off as great friends, sharing struggles, achievements, past stories, celebrating birthdays together, you name it. i moved countries for 2 years of our friendship and started noticing that thats when B would text me back 2 months after i sent B texts, and rarely ever asked me about my life (asked me first that is, not asking me in return as part of a conversation that I started). i brushed it off as B being busy, and later when my family moved back to B's country i was excited at the prospect of our friendship becoming 'alive' again. but tbh that didn't happen. i live 15 minutes away from B, yet B only responds to me every 2-3 months. i know what u might be thinking 'bro move on she has new friends'. thats the thing. her parents are close to mine and never not mention that I am B's closest and best friend. also, whenever a plan to hangout happens (once every 6 months despite me being here now for 2 years), me and B talk as if we have been friends from birth. confusing right?? last hangout i brought this up that i found the monthly texts a bit weird but B said 'im bad at responding'. what does that mean in the 21st century where phones are meant to connect people even at distances? i chose to ignore B's reasoning and just dropped the topic. when i discussed it with my family, they believed thats how B probably is by nature and that i may be the more proactive one in the friendship.

onto A (i promise this story is coming together) A is more close to me honestly than B simply because she understands me better. we have similar humor, share similar career goals, and even have family living in parts of the world where the other wants to go for education (meaning that we always have a 'home' for the other in the country of choice) etc etc. The issue with A now is that about 7 months after we met, A got into a relationship (im quite happy for her, her partner is the best- strange coming from the best friend i know). I really do support their relationship and pray it lasts. but now the twist, 2 months into A's relationship, mine and A's friendship was fine. but then, our sleepovers reduced from once a month to none. i know u might think 'let her live she has a boyfriend' but heres the catch, when i stopped going to A's home or even outside with A to malls, cinemas, etc, I realized how our friendship was exactly like mine and B's. in the sense that during school hours we were inseperable, but after school, it was not a single text or call until school resumed the next day. now i dont have an issue with it at all, in fact its weird to constantly text, but i never received anything (an update on their day, a request from A to hangout, etc) and only ever received texts when A needed homework or notes or other stuff to copy off of me. so of course when realization hit i got upset. but i didnt say anything for 3 months.

a month ago, it got extreme. A went for nearly 2 months (1 month on vacation, another month of school) without ever texting me outside school hours. i felt used. A also never initiated any plans, and when I did, they eventually got canceled because A wanted to spend time with their partner. A went to the extent to lie to their parents that A was seeing me and go see her partner instead, thats just flat out rude. dont get me wrong, friend to friend, its fine but not when you are just using your friend consistently in more ways than one. A would even go outside with me to coffee shops (and take her boyfriend too) and then sit there for the whole time having inside jokes and conversations with him that only the two of them have context on, leave the seat next to me to sit next to him (and give me a sip of her drink as some sort of compensation?) and yeah, all that stuff. dont get me wrong i firsthand have been obsessed with spending time with a partner, that too a first ever partner, but its flat out rude to do that to your friends when you have gone out with them.

i felt hurt and realized just how alone i was (in a non depressing way). i felt as if my 'friends' A and B were just using me. on top of that, constantly hearing about A's amazing loving dates, their sexual experiences, the undying loyalty from their partner really cut. every night i felt as alone as someone could. that on top of having a\*\* friends, i was quite unlovable or unapproachable or unattractive as well (god knows if its one of those or all- again in a non depressing and non-low-self esteem way). when you see your friends getting the world while you beg for crumbs is just a weird feeling.

anways i confronted A and they were quite mature about their behavior, apologized, and are now actually fixing their actions as well. however with B, i honestly think ive lost all energy. last year when B celebrated my birthday with me i felt during discussions that I'm not able to connect with B on a more personal level, it was all just surface level 'school's hard' discussions. and honestly, although A says to try and let B know that I'd appreciate some contact, I feel like from what I have learnt from my breakup, its not the best always to beg for basic things. i am well aware that friendship rules are different, but B is mature enough to know that mainting a bit of contact with your friends is healthy and needed to maintain a friendship, those low maintenance friendships are just a hidden way of keeping someone around until u need them. i say this because B does conviniently only messages me whenever finals start and my plans for university (where ive applied, how much it costs, etc) because B wishes to go to the same country as well.

to throw in some more drama, i have a younger family friend C who always goes in and out of the picture and only texts me saying 'i wish i had someone to love and to hug' and all that crap. dont get me wrong feeling lonely is something anyone can feel, but really? monday to sunday every day u text ur friends about the same stuff everytime? and then just switch up and ignore them? C has been there for me a lot during my breakup, but after that whenever i reached out to spend time together and explore new places or things, C has other friends to go to.

if that isnt enough, i am constantly studying. 6-8 hours a day. i break my back at this damn desk because of..you guessed it..the damn parents. it hurts going online and seeing my people i know (including A) going on vacations, having parties at home, spending time with other friends, when all im allowed to do is study at home. its unfair, other people cheat, they study for probably 2 hours and still get good grades and have parents that let them have freedom. why do i have to fight to enjoy some time as well? my family quite literayy says 'you are a student. your life is the books.'

all in all i kinda hate my life, my home, my friends, and my 'love life' (its non existant but u get it). i live in a place where its hard to just get into a bar or party and hookup with someone so i cant even relieve some tension. im exhausted by the time im in bed, my eyes and head hurt because of staring at those shitty books all day when my friends enjoy their time. i see my ex everyday in school as well and hear about how they are enjoying time with some new chick, while im here just by myself (im not desperate, but ive moved on and would like to meet someone new). i know in some time im going abroad soon for education and that i should just wait until that happens to meet new people, but still, what do i do right now? its getting almost a chore to wakeup everyday, study the same shit, and receive a text or two every other day only because i told A to text me more. am i asking for a lot? or do i need to balance my needs with what others can give me?

sometimes i think of equally being a bi\*\*\* to my friends when i get a partner and just ghosting them, but obviously thats not good. other people just go ghost on me, side track me, make me feel left out and it makes me want to do the same to them but i just cant. i thrive off of close contact with a few good friends, and it sucks that no ones able to understand it.

anyways, sorry for that entire novel. i starred out cuss words coz idk if my post would get banned, if u made it until here thanks a lot, hope u have some advice for me",1,1744300008.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Help me read these cues?,"Hi! Posting here because this is and the AuDHD communities are the ones I feel understood by the most so perhaps you’ll be able to help me read this cues (if that’s what they are LOL). 

So, I’ve been going to this coffee shop for a while now, pretty often. There’s a guy that works there. I actually met him one time at an event prior to going to this coffee shop and knowing he worked there and we had incredible conversation. And yes, I thought he was cute. Part of me hoped we’d chat more as I went into the coffee shop more but his job was a little more behind the scenes (not barista/counter service) so I just wouldn’t see him often or he would be in work mode so I just kind of let the ship sail. 

That is, until 8 months later, which was a month ago. I was getting coffee with a friend and he waved at me. It was friendly I think. But then that whole couple hours, I kept catching him staring or glancing at me. It piqued my interest again, and my curiosity for sure. It just seemed different than before. 

Every week I’ve gone in since then, same thing. I swear he notices me walk in everytime and every chance he gets he’s catching a glance at me. 

We’ve said hi a couple more times too, usually quick when he’s in passing in work mode, but also once when he was leaving work too and I happened to be walking past his car. He practically flagged me down and I was so nervous it was mostly small talk (Of course, I was with a guy friend and now I’m terrified that he thinks I’m dating someone— definitely want to clarify that next time I get a chance to chat to him)… but! It was different. Suddenly we are just orbiting each other so much more. And tbh, I get the sense we are both more nervous? Or maybe that’s just me LOL.

I keep thinking I’m making this up, but then I’ll go in to the coffee shop and same thing. 

So TL;DR… is this eye contact thing something that could actually mean he’s interested? Should I make an effort to try and catch him on a break and chat? I had an opportunity the other day but got nervous and kept walking. Lol.",1,1744299913.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False
1jw12tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1jw12tf/caffeine_timing_question/,Caffeine TIMING question,"

Hello fellow fitness pals! This will be kind of a ramble, so bear with me if interested!

41. Female. Weight is great. Recently sober and loving it. 

I workout almost every day at 5, 6 or 7 AM depending on my schedule. I get up around 4 AM always. I’m in a routine of chugging a glass of lemon water after I wake up. I will then have a cup of coffee on the early dark ride to the gym.  Creatine water during my workout. Than, come home to eat breakfast. (My go to is sprouted toast with avocado and scrambled eggs.) I usually follow that up with a double Nespresso shot iced latte or canned energy drink (like Monster, C4 etc) later in the morning. 

Recently, I’ve wanted to try delaying my caffeine and working out with my natural energy. I’m thinking of trying to have a decaf tea or coffee on the ride to the gym (placebo effect maybe?) Creatine water dying my workout still, come home for breakfast and THAN have a full cup of coffee. I’d still grab an iced latte or energy drink later that morning, or let’s be honest.. with spring kids sports schedules- maybe save that caffeine for the afternoon some days? 

In any event, I’d always like to limit my caffeine for the day to 400 mg ish total.  

I suppose I’m looking for insight on this, and find out what may have worked for others. My goal is optimization of my workouts, taking care of my gut, and maintaining energy throughout the day. 

Is there really a noticable benefit to delaying caffeine for a few hours after I wake up? Is the struggle of feeling groggy for the first few days worth it? And, is there a benefit to eating before I have that coffee? 

I’m a routine person thru and thru, so I’m looking to dial in what may work best and stick to it. 

PS I know energy drinks aren’t great for me. I try to limit them to just a few days a week but damn do they hit so good! ",0,1744299890.0,fitness30plus,3,0.5,False

My mom and sister have one and always talk about how much they love it. So I started looking up machines to think about which one I would get someday. And decided on the pop+ because I don’t have a ton of space, I think they’re cute, and I like the expert mode option. I also learned from you guys here that the next has a lot of issues.

Anyway, I started seeing all these vids on my tiktok fyp of people making their nespresso drinks or showing their cute coffee bars and it just made me feel excited and happy. I wasn’t in a rush to get one, but just feeling excited about the idea whenever the time was right for me to invest in one.

And after a week of that, I was texting with a friend and mentioned that I wanted to get a nespresso and her response was “do you want a free one? My mom just bought one but she doesn’t want or need it and it’s still brand new and hasn’t been used” …umm yes?! I asked her what machine it was and she didn’t know, all she knew was that it was red lol.

I received it a week ago and guess what! It’s the pop+! And I really love it so much, every morning I feel so excited about making my coffee. I still have my keurig and some pods left that I want to finish, but I can’t bring myself to make it because it’s just not the same experience haha.

I’ve only tried the flavored coffees so far, and I’m loving the sweet vanilla and hazelnut pods. But I’m looking forward to exploring all the different coffees and double espressos. 

I know it’s kind of silly, but I was not in a rush to get my machine and I was not expecting to get one for free. It was such a surprise that made me feel genuine joy and I experience that joy every morning and just wanted to share!",11,1744299319.0,nespresso,10,0.92,False

I am a recent CS grad (graduated in Dec. 2023) and I would love some advice on how to improve my resume. I am aiming for any software engineer jobs, ideally as a web developer or for full-stack roles, along with just front-end or back-end roles. I am located in NC and have been applying to jobs in the Raleigh-Durham area along with remote positions. I would be willing to relocate to CA. I have been working on improving my web dev skills with The Odin Project after graduating. With my applications so far, I have either gotten rejected or ghosted. I have not been given an interview yet, so I would like to know if anything in my resume is off-putting! I am writing cover letters for each job as well, so I decided not to have a summary section.

I am wondering if maybe my projects are not tailored enough to the web dev sphere? I have included these projects because they are the ones I am most confident in, and I would need to spend more time creating more projects to perfectly align with the roles I am looking at. So, let me know if I should focus there.

I should note that I was originally planning to go into game development, but I changed my mind about 6 months ago and wanted to focus more on web dev. Also, I used to have project dates next to each project, but was given advice to move just the year to the top of the projects title. Please let me know if the formatting is alright or if the information is way too dense. One last thing, I included my old server job to show that I am committed with good communication skills, but let me know if it's not relevant for this resume

Thank you in advance for taking a look at my resume!

I only got ripped off one time, with a vape i brought which was supposed to be 1000 puffs but finished in half a day. It might not be the sellers fault,because he opened the package in front of me. 
Before i brought anything i checked the price on Talabat (which is generally more expensive because its a delivery app) and never paid anything more than the price on the app. 
Used Uber everywhere with card payment,never took local taxis.
Instead of buying a sim card at the airport,i brought one in the city at the Orange store for the same price they listed on their website.
Got 7GB internet package with sim card for 250 egp or something. 
The hustlers didn't bother me much, they are just doing their job,why hate on them? 
Just don't engage, and keep on walking.
At Karnak Temple we got approached by a security guard offering to take our pictures which we didn't want at first but somehow he managed to take my phone and snap a few pictures, well i got a few okay-ish pictures and paid nothing to him,because thats not how it works.
Never spoken to any taxi driver,wait staff or shop keeper outside of the necessity, and definitely didn't smile or joked/laughed with any man. Kept the talking brief and maintained a stone face at all times. Never got harassed.
I had a really amazing vacation ❤️

Chapter 1
Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

Chapter 2
Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”

Chapter 3
Auren POV

As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.

Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.

But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.

“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.

Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”

As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.

I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.

I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”

“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.

He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.

I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”

The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”

With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”

He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”

I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.

“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”

Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,

“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”

“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.

“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.

When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.

Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.

She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”

She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”

I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?

The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.

Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”

Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.

The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.

A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.

Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.

When our gazes locked, I gasped and my cheeks heated.

Chapter 4
Lucien POV

The council chamber of the Shadowfang Pack was stifling, filled with the heavy presence of my pack’s Elders. They had serious expression, their faces weathered with age and experience and their eyes carrying the weight of centuries of tradition. I stood before them, my arms crossed, my jaw tight as they droned on about duty and heirs.

“You cannot keep delaying this, Lucien,” Elder Orlan said in a sharp voice. “The pack needs an heir. Without one, we risk losing everything we’ve built.”

I clenched my fists, the sharp points of my claws pressing into my palms. “And what happens to the woman you force me to marry?” My voice was cold, laced with a simmering anger I couldn’t contain. “She will die, just like the others who died marrying my ancestors.” I really wanted to put an end to this.

Elder Ryna, the oldest among them, leaned forward, her pale gray eyes penetrating. “We know the cost of the curse. But the survival of the Shadowfang pack must come first. Your power keeps us strong, but strength alone will not secure our future.”

Their words were like iron chains around me, dragging me back to the nightmare I lived every day. The curse—a cruel legacy of my bloodline—had claimed every bride my forefathers had taken. On the night of the full moon after our bond was sealed, death would come for them, slowly, silent and final. Within a year they all died. How many women will die just to carry my bloodline?

It was said that centuries ago, the moon goddess cursed our Alpha bloodline for betraying love or breaking a sacred bond. Rejections happened all the time, but I don’t know why did the goddess curse my forefather? What was special about that mate bond?

I turned away, pacing to the window. The moon hung low in the sky, veiled by storm clouds. “You think an heir will fix this?” I said bitterly. “The curse will take them too. It doesn’t just stop with my bride.”

Orlan sighed heavily. “We don’t know that. There is a chance...”

“There is no chance!” I snapped, spinning to face them. “This curse is absolute. It doesn’t matter how strong I am or how much the Alphas of the North grovel for my alliance. They want my strength, not my curse.”

Ryna’s gaze didn’t waver. “Strength is what keeps us alive, Lucien. That’s why they seek you, despite the curse. It’s why we must ensure your bloodline continues. Without you, the North falls.”

Their words were upsetting, not because I disagreed, but because I knew they were right. The Shadowfang pack thrived because of me—because of the power I wielded. Alphas from all corners sought my favor. Their alliances were a testament to my strength. Yet beneath it all, I was hollow, bound by a curse that tainted everything it touched.

Elder Orlan said, “There is an offer from Alpha Bram. An alliance in exchange for one of his omegas as your bride. She’s expendable to him, but this alliance will secure his loyalty. It is a solution that benefits us all. He has been seeking your alliance from a long time.”

An omega. My stomach churned at the thought. I had no use for alliances built on the backs of weak and innocent. As such I disliked Bram. He was a slimy bastard.

I closed my eyes, the weight of their stares pressing on me. “If I agree, this alliance must serve the pack above all else.”

“Of course,” Ryna said, leaning back in her chair with satisfaction.

The decision settled like a stone in my chest. I would take another bride, knowing her fate, because I had no other choice. I was twenty-seven already and hadn't found my mate. And I knew that I couldn’t love my forced bride. Ever.

---

The journey to Crimson Howl was uneventful, but my thoughts roiled with every mile. When we arrived, I noticed the pack house was bustling. Bram greeted me with a wide smile. “It’s a pleasure to have you here, Alpha Lucien.” I grunted in response.

He guided me to the main hall of his packhouse. “The omega I promised,” he said, gesturing toward the far corner. “Auren.”

My gaze followed his hand, landing on her. My breath hitched. Auren had golden hair that caught the light. She was small, barely reaching my shoulder, and she was trembling like a deer in headlight. Her face was soft like that of an elf, her presence fragile. She looked pale and thin as if she hadn’t had food for days. Her head was slightly bowed, but not out of submission—it felt like she was trying to disappear.

As she stepped forward, her scent hit me—a sweet, warm fragrance of apples that stirred my wolf. For a moment, she lifted her eyes to mine. They were gray, like that of a pale moon veiled in mist.

“Alpha Lucien,” Alpha Bram said, snapping me out of my thoughts. “I hope she will serve the purpose,” he added like she was a commodity. He stood beside me exuding false camaraderie. His grin was tight and it wasn't difficult to see through him. This was not a gesture of goodwill—it was a business transaction, plain and simple. I didn’t like the way his gaze lingered on her.

As for Auren, I didn’t care for her fragility or her fear. What roiled my insides was the blatant manipulation behind this so-called alliance. I had no intention of entertaining this charade. Yet I had no choice.

“Prepare the treaty,” I said flatly, not sparing her another glance.

Bram's face flickered with excitement. “Of course, Alpha Lucien. I’ll have it drawn up immediately.”

I turned to leave, but a commotion stopped me in my tracks.

“Worthless girl!” Maris’s voice rang out, dripping with venom. I knew who Maris was. Bram’s future Luna. A gold digger. Her father had approached me to marry her, but I had refused not because I had come to know of her plans of divorcing me and taking away half my money in less than a month, but because she was a repulsive creature. And now she found Bram. They fitted well.

I pivoted, my sharp gaze locking onto the scene. Auren was being yanked by her arm by Maris’s rough grip. The poor girl winced, her free hand attempting to shield herself.

Maris’s lips twisted into a sneer. “You should be grateful for this opportunity. You don’t deserve to breathe the same air as us, let alone be offered as a bride to Alpha Lucien. And now you’re making us look bad?”

“That’s enough.” My voice cut through the air like a blade.

Maris froze, her grip slackening on Auren’s arm. She turned to face me, her expression quickly shifting to one of false innocence. “Alpha Lucien, I was just—”

“I don’t care for your justifications,” I said coldly. “Behave yourself.”

Maris’s face reddened, but she protested, “She’s just an omega. She should know her place that she is nothing but a breeder.”

I took a step forward, my presence towering over hers. “Her place is no concern of yours. Do not test me.”

Surprised, Maris swallowed hard as she left her. “I—I’m sorry,” she muttered.

I shifted my attention back to Bram. “Ensure your pack members know how to act in front of me,” I said, my tone laced with a warning.

Bram clenched his teeth, glaring at Maris. “Yes, I’m sorry Alpha Lucien.” His gaze landed on Auren again, and this time I could see the lust.

Not liking it one bit, I gestured to Tarian, my beta. “Handle her,” I said curtly, referring to Auren. “Get her packed and ready. We leave in two hours.”

Tarian nodded with a neutral expression, approaching her.

As I turned to leave, I felt the faintest pull of something—a whisper in the back of my mind urging me ",1,1744298757.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I’ve decided I am going to leave my current job and go apply to another so I can save some more money and get out of my parent’s house (they are unaware). To get this job it’s asking me for some forms of ID. I have my drivers license but it needs more than just that. Couple of days ago I was looking for the folder where we keep my and my brothers birth certificates and social security cards. The folder was no where to be found. This struck me as weird as it’s usually downstairs somewhere whether it be on the counter or under the coffee table. I let it go and went to bed deciding it would be tomorrow’s problem. The day comes and I asked her for my birth certificate and social security card are. She gets defensive and asked me why I needed them with a million other questions added on. Simple question didn’t see why she got upset when I asked for them. She starts digging around the whole house looking for them. She’s getting frustrated because she “can’t find them” so then I suggest maybe her closet. That suggestion she got super defensive even though I was just saying maybe it could be in there. She digs through her closet with the door closed but just enough she can still look. What do you know she comes out with my social security card but no birth certificate. The card and certificate are always together, never separated. I have my card with me right now but not my birth certificate. If it comes down to it I’ll go get another at the town hall or whatever but this is all just weird. 

The plan for me moving out is to move in with my boyfriend. He has his own place and I have a car. One thing is they hate my boyfriend with an absolute passion. He would never do anything to hurt me or upset me. He genuinely loves me more than anything in this world. I know their reasons they don’t like him and I understand that coming from a parent with a daughter prospective, but to hide my legal documents that pretty much show I’m a citizen of the United States and a real person is just insane. This is why I’m moving out. Any advice? I also live in Massachusetts if it depends on what state. ",2,1744298662.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False
1jw0l6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jw0l6b/im_sorry_im_not_sure/,I'm sorry I'm not sure,"I thought you were mine. I'm going to try and make this simple and direct. I thought I was going to spend my future connected with you. I knew we were graduating and that life would pull us apart, but for some reason, that never really worried me. Looking back, us not living together and you dodging my one attempt didn’t really stress me out. Sure, I would have liked to talk about it, but I was certain it would all work out. I couldn't see a world where it didn’t. I only saw us together in our future. Even during those first dozen weeks apart, a part of me was confident we'd come back for each other. Even after you told me it was over for good, I knew—or I thought—it wasn’t.
This week has been my first where I feel okay. My soul feels whole, not split between two people. I don’t have the desire to write about this anymore. I think my emotions towards this are behind me. This isn’t to say I don't still hurt or I don’t love you—I do. I loge you.  It’s just that the color of love is different now. It feels distant, like a love from afar, where I wish, from the bottom of my heart, that you accomplish everything your heart desires and live the amazing life you dream about. The kind of life I couldn’t be a part of. The kind of love where I'm your loudest supporter that you never hear.
I'll love you forever. I believed that, given any amount of time, no matter where we find ourselves, I would sense you. Even if you just walked by me in a subway or crowd, I would know from the peripherals of my eyes—from the color of your soul, the outline of your walk, or the scent of your mood. I would still be able to look into your eyes and know if you were content. I would know to be just another person in line for coffee when I order, knowing I should answer with a different name because you are a different person with the same eyes. That ink on your skin tells a different story now, a story I had heard the beginning of a million times.
People, you included, have told me I write heartfelt letters to those around me. When I do, I find myself in my own world, where I can express myself with words that never seem to mind when I speak. I think I had a hard time writing about you because I only find myself in that space when I am writing about sadness—an emotion that feels more familiar than most others. I know it’s sappy, a little cringe, but now you get all the letters you wanted. It only took a bit of grief from both of us to put me back in a familiar space—a space I know how to leave but take my time doing so, to revisit everything else I left behind. Like walking around your house in the dark—not seeing anything but knowing exactly where everything is, sensing the furniture and moving around it, acknowledging its presence either way, feeling the surfaces and picturing the way the wood grain looked, by feeling it with my fingers before I walk upstairs again to continue what is left in my life.",3,1744298655.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1jw0j4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jw0j4h/coffee_meets_bagel_is_the_worst_serious_dating_app/,Coffee Meets Bagel is the WORST “serious” dating app,"Previous fan here. Coffee Meets Bagel is known for more “serious” dates, and I’ve had good experiences on it before. I used to recommend it to friends a lot, but recently I just had the most ridiculous, f*ked up, shittiest experience. 

A Korean-American guy matched with me, and asked me directly to answer questions to prove I’m a “real” person — What’s everyone’s comfort food (why “everyone” lol?) and another question — 

I sense a condescending tone in the texts. 

So I teased him: “How do you prove to me that YOU’re a real person lol?” “How would I know *everone’s* comfort food lol, guess only GPT can do that”. 

Then he started ACCUSING ME immediately and harshly, saying “yea exactly, you’re an online scammer, you’re gaslighting me”, and he literally DEMANDS me to “send a photo with my body, with a paper written my name and his name” to prove I’m a real human.

WTF is that? I am NOT a scammer but I’m not going to do that. Demanding an online stranger like she’s your servant? Way to go, loser. 

if he ever has normal IQ, he should be able to tell I’m real from my banters and the way I talk. 

But he convinced himself that I’m catfishing, attacked me nonstop, and within 30 seconds — he said “yeah you’re out”, he reported & unmatched me.

Because he unmatched first, I can’t see his profile again so I can’t report him. I thought about taking screenshots of our convos and post them-

But I know there’re many online lunatics that are just super paranoid, traumatized or insecure. “It’s not worth your time.” I told myself.

Then… GUESS WHAT? The dating app CMB FROZE MY ACCOUNT due to that ONE CRAZY PERSON’s report, saying I had to verify my identity. 

“Ok, no big deal” — I uploaded my VALID passport and State ID — didn’t work. The system is not even smart enough to recognize them. LOL.

I HAVE TO APPEAL TO the customer service, sending multiple requests to them to verify my identity, PROVING I am a human, not a catfish, even though I have all the valid documents. 

I don’t care about the account tbh, I’m pretty much done with the app at this point, but the whole experience is completely f*ked up and humiliating. 

48+ hours later, my account got approved — But I’ve lost ALL OF MY EXISTING MATCHES. There’re two matches I WAS ALREADY TALKING TO that were respectful and felt nice. 

But apparently they saw CMB’s notice that I might be a scammer and unmatched me.

Way to protect the attacker and hurt a loyal user, CMB. 🙃

I will NEVER use this shitty app ever again. And I will advise everyone I know to stay away from it. 

I know dating apps are shitty nowadays, but this is just unhinged & unbelievable. Hope those irresponsible apps die sooner.

Makoto: God dammit. Is Shiryu in here?

**She found her brother in the back, crying on the mattress. Shiryu was always cursed with a temper despite hating violence. He grew up always getting into fights and then crying until he threw up. He was sobbing in his sleep now.**

Makoto: Damn it, come on bro, I can’t handle seeing you cry. **She reached out and shook him gently.**

**Unbeknownst to her, he was preoccupied at the moment. You see being the son of a disgraced hero like Mineta was difficult on its own. But being created with the intention of replacing one of the worst villains in history isn’t easy either. The vestiges of the other quirks were plenty sociable.**

**One of which was watching him cry.**

Kenichi: *Poor boy…*

**Hardflame fan, Spring-like limbs, Hypertrophy; those are the quirks in his body right now. He’s had them since childhood, whenever he needed someone to talk to.**

**The others were silent as the quirk users looked at him in pity. But there was one in particular who wanted to talk to him.**

**The original owner of Spring-like limbs was a hero named Springer. He’d been captured by Allforone’s lackey Gigantomachia and killed shortly after his quirk was stolen. He was the key factor behind Shiryu not growing into a full fledged villain.**

Springer: Yo kid, you good?

Shiryu: I didn’t mean to lose control again.

Springer: C’mon don’t beat yourself up like that.

**Okay maybe those three weren’t the only quirks in there. There were two other ones, but these were different from the others. These were artificially designed from mixing together different quirk factors into one, forging different results. He looked over at one of them as it thrashed against its chains.**

**Shiryu didn’t like it when they moved that much. They weren’t supposed to be moving like that. He was supposed to have control, not them.**

**And yet he still managed to lose it, as soon as he saw the daughter of Katsuki Bakugo he couldn’t hold back his rage and everything went white. When he came back, she was barely breathing, her face becoming unrecognizable due to the swelling. Shiryu looked at his own hands in horror, he wasn’t an animal.**

Springer: Hey, look at me.

**Shiryu hesitantly looks over his shoulder at his mentor with tearful dead eyes.** Shiryu: I’m nothing like that Himiko Toga freak, I don’t want to use this cursed body as an excuse to hurt people. I want this to end.

Springer: This body wasn’t cursed when it gave you life. You’re the person who decides what you do with that power.

**The vestiges for Hypertrophy and Hardflame fan got closer as the dark storm around him started to pick up.**

Springer: Hey, hey! Look at me. Take a deep breath and come back to me.

Shiryu: I am a monster, a hodgepodge thrown together to be a living weapon! That’s why everyone keeps trying to hurt me!

Springer: That’s bullshit and you know it. You’re not a damn weapon, you’re just a kid. You can cry and break down all you want right now, but at the end of the day you get back up and do better than you did yesterday, okay?

**Shiryu woke up with a start, surprising his sister into falling off the bed.** Makoto: What the hell—hey are you okay?

Shiryu: *rubs his eyes* Yeah…I’m fine.

Makoto: We can get back on track now that the Army of stain doesn’t have an outpost. We have to hurry before they get Tamashiro to talk and they catch up with us.
**

**Cere was running on adrenaline by the time she got home. Maybe Endeavor was right about her not being ready to use any of his ultimate moves or her other quirks. She had to be carried up to her bedroom and tucked in as she slept for the rest of the day.**

Shoto: *sighs* She’s going to give me a heart attack one day.

Momo: You’re telling me. **She said fanning herself while she sat on Cere’s bed.**

Shoto: I don’t know where she gets this recklessness from.

**He brushes her hair out of her face before leaving her to rest.**

Momo: She comes from someone who had a hard time loving himself. 

**Cere found herself in a dark stormy place. She immediately realized she wasn’t awake since she could see perfectly.**

**She found that her surroundings resembled a vast desert covered in red tinted blood like rain. Thunder rumbled in the distance as the world felt like it was closing in on her.**

**She looks at her own body, realizing that a fog was emanating from her. It finally clicked with her as she realized where she was. This is the fabled vestige world she heard from Deku’s memories during one of his visits. Supposedly on the off chance a person's Quirk is given to someone else, the consciousness of the previous wielder will appear in the new user's psyche.**

**The rain intensified as the darkness in the sky closed in on her. There was no wind nor any sign of life aside from the storm. She felt alone and vulnerable as she was the only thing that was visible here.**

**That’s when five vestiges appeared around her. The previous users of Radiowave, Scatter, Heavy Payload, Bloodlet, and Blood virus were with her.**

Radiowave: *approaches slowly* Hello there…

Cere: Hi there?

**The others followed suit in greeting her, but their voices were hollow and distorted, almost like speaking to a broken radio.**

Cere: You were all people Allforone stole quirks from over his hundred year reign?

Bloodlet: If you’re referring to that old bastard stealing our quirks then yes.

**He was a grouchy looking doctor with veiny wrists, she remembered his quirk let him expel all the blood from his body.** Cere: Why did Allforone come for any of you?

Bloodlet: We were all people who were unfortunate enough to have something that bastard wanted.

Heavy Payload: We should make the most of your visit here…

**She later found out that three of the vestiges were part of the resistance that fought against Allforone during the early years of quirks, back when they were called meta abilities.**

Scatter: It’s been a long time since I have seen anything besides the inside of the bastard’s head. You’re different from him, you can feel that much by your presence.

Heavy Payload: Most of us got taken out when Allforone suddenly came crashing through our base. No idea why though.

Blood virus: He was a psychotic brute with a plan that he wouldn’t share even though I worked for him. He was a damn lunatic.

Cere: I’m sorry if I caused you any…pain, is that what happens when I use your quirks?

Radiowave: Our quirks are your power now, it’s your choice how you use them.

Cere: Are you sure…god it just feels like I’m using something that doesn’t belong to me. But I need your power because I was born with a target on my back.

**Each of the vestiges look at her in a sympathetic way.**

Cere: My father, real father was a…troubled man trying to atone for mistakes that he made in high school. That led to him being kidnapped…violated and creating…me. My entire life I’ve heard about the century of chaos Allforone curated, two of my siblings and myself were bred to replace him. My legacy comes from two men hated by the entire country.

Bloodlet: Sounds like you’ve had your own share of a rough life. No one should have to live with that kind of a shadow over them.

Cere: My life has been nothing but shadows. **For a brief moment the vestige world shows what she hides from the rest of the world behind a curtain of optimism—her dull tear-filled cataract eyes.**

Radio wave: Oh sweetheart.

Cere: I need to learn how to use your quirks effectively if I’m going to protect myself from Phoenix tree…or anyone else.

Bloodlet: Then we shall help you.

**Akari had fallen into a deep sleep after leaving the hospital. His experience with the rubber man had been haunting for him, he almost thought nobody would be coming to his rescue.**

Jiro: There we go. Rest easy kid, you’re safe here.

**Akari groaned lightly in his sleep as he writhed on her shoulder.**

Jiro: *pats his head* It’s okay, just relax.

**But he couldn’t relax, he couldn’t forget the pain on his back, couldn’t ignore the echoes of the rubber man, couldn’t stop thinking of the things that were said. He couldn’t…he couldn’t… where was he now? This wasn’t his bedroom.**

**He looked around the vast dark landscape, he was standing amongst red rain yet he was completely dry.**

**He was soon surrounded by five people.**

**The vestiges stared at him before the one with Brawn Boost kneeled down to his level.** Brawn Boost: *softly* Hello there kid, are you lost?

**The toddler shirked under the weight of their collective gaze.** Akari: Am I in trouble?

Brawn Boost: Trouble? No no no kid, you’re safe here.

**One of them lifted him up in their arms.** Akari: I keep getting hurt by everyone.

Impact Recoil: Why do you think that?

Akari: I keep getting hurt because I remind people of Daddy. People keep telling me I’m going to do bad things when I grow up. What am I doing wrong?

Kinetic Booster: Kid, you haven’t done a thing wrong okay. Other people being scared of you isn’t your fault.

Akari: Then why do people keep hurting me? Why do they keep treating me like a—like…a **The poor boy’s image contorted into something disturbing, largely magenta with black markings, fangs, claws, instead of boot like feet there are two visible toes resembling a wendigo in appearance.**

Air Cannon: Kid—that’s not what you are okay. You’re a human being, not a weapon.

Akari: I’m a monster! **He towers over them all and lets out an eerie howl.**

**The five vestiges look on in horror at the sight in front of them.** 
Brawn Boost: What’s going on? 
Impact Recoil: He didn’t look like a monster a second ago. 
Air Cannon: What’s got into the poor kid? **Body Bulk gently placed him back on the ground.**

Akari: Everything hurts! The lies all hurt!

Kinetic Booster: *places a hand on his shoulder* Breathe. Take a deep breath and come back to us.

**The world around Akari momentarily crumbles and he woke up in a bed, though the pain never left. His wounds ached and he felt his skin crawl. It felt like even the air itself was against him.**

Chihiro: Akari, you’re awake! **Dropping the tray in her arms she ran to pick up her baby brother.**

Akari: Hurts…

Chihiro: I’m sorry, did I reopen your wounds? I’ll go get— **The toddler grabs her wrist.**

Akari: Don’t leave…don’t leave!

Chihiro: I won’t, I promise I won’t…

**Makoto found herself being held at the bottom of a lake before being dragged out by three figures in tactile clothing. She knows this memory…too well. The daughters of Stain surrounded her, the vault made sure she felt everything in excruciating detail. The water in her lungs, the red in her eyes, the numbness that followed the fear.**

**One of the women grabbed her face and said something, but she couldn’t hear it. Regardless she knew where she was. This was the night *that woman* left her Father to die. The night the Daughters of Stain were contracted to erase his existence from the country. Her hearing finally came back she felt a tendril snake around her leg. She recognized these last words that existed in her nightmares.** “That’s where you are wrong, Mineta. You were never a person, you were always a monster. You simply learned how to hide it. And this friend of yours was just too blind to see it.”

**The three women laughed before the water pushed against her again. Her hair was floating around her like a veil. She felt her back touch a wall and she could see bubbles leaving her mouth.**

**At that moment her numbing fear was gone…and utterly replaced with rage. Rage that woke her up from her nightmare as she was alerted to her brother calling her.**

Shiryu: Sis! wake up, you need to wake up **He was sitting at the foot of her bed, having shaken her awake.**

**Makoto let out a guttural scream as she leaped out of her bed. The thorns that had grown from her shoulders slowly receded into her skin.** Makoto: What is it?

Shiryu: You were having a nightmare. You were screaming and writhing in your sleep…like a crazy person.

Makoto: Maybe I am crazy…

Shiryu: Don’t say that, you’re fine. **He hugged her and pulled her closer.** Someone sent an encrypted message.

**Surely enough, someone had in fact messaged her, simply saying “I have something you want.”** Makoto: How long has this been here?

Shiryu: About 10 minutes…

Makoto: Damn…**She lightly chewed her finger as she thought what would be the best thing to do next.**

Shiryu: You’re not thinking of replying to them, are you?

Makoto: It wouldn’t hurt to entertain them for a little bit. **She messaged back “And what would that be?”**

**The reply only took a moment to pop up, which worried her. The response simply read, “There’s a cafe on the corner of Akiyama street. Be there in 10 minutes if you want it.”**

Makoto: Shiiiiiit…

Shiryu: Please tell me you’re not actually going to go.

Makoto: What noooo that’s crazy talk, c’mon what are you talking about. **She casually says while walking towards the door of the RV with her jacket.**

Shiryu: Sis, stop messing around!

**Like a cat pushing a lamp off a table she slipped outside and closed the door.**

Shiryu: Damnit damn it all!

**Veil swiped the keycard he’d acquired while Glitch turned off all the cameras.** Glitch: Do we really need to release this guy, I know we’re desperate for temps but I still value my life.

Veil: “We do not have many other options at the moment, with all the people we lost to the Army of Stain.”

**Obscuring their appearances, they delved deeper into the prison. They stumbled across an isolated vacuum sealed cell. Inside was a man hooked up to a life support device and wrapped in chains. His face was covered by a skull-like metal mask.**

Glitch: “This is the guy?”

Veil: Mustang Flame, the A class villain who lit Shinjuku on fire until Dynamight apprehended him. **The mention of the explosive hero seems to rouse the pyromaniac from his slumber.**

Mustang: Burn…

Veil: Easy there, Enja Midareuchi, your cell is vacuum sealed and you don’t have enough oxygen in that tank to get through that glass.

*His hand twitches in response* Mustang: More…air…

Veil: Ah ah ah, first you have to take care of these two. **He held up a headline of the Mineta children.**

*He chuckles, only for it to devolve into a fit of hacking and wheezing* Mustang: Yeah…

**In one of Phoenix Tree’s remaining compounds, the despicable work of Dr Ujiko was being carried out on a semi-willing test subject. Mineta wasn’t the only disgraced hero.** Ignition, engage!

People who need a couple of kids dead, but first I need you to do some digging.

**Makoto tucked away her hair inside her jacket as she and her brother walked into the cafe incognito. She scanned the room for anyone inconspicuous.**

Here!

**Following the hushed voice, Makoto’s eyes fell on a very short woman with a large, round head compared to her narrow body. That’s when she noticed the raspberry pink hair she was hiding under a scarf.** Makoto: La Brava?

La Brava: I see you recognize me.

Makoto: There aren’t that many people in the country that are three feet tall. 
La Brava: Very funny…

Makoto: I guess it makes sense how you found us, being such a great hacker. What do you want?

La Brava: Simple, I have something you’re going to need.

Makoto: What could you possibly have that I nee— **The question dies in her throat when she held up a disc that she recognized from her Dad’s memories.**

La Brava: You know exactly what this is.

**She did, fifteen years back when her Dad was on the run from everyone he had several opportunities to prove his innocence that were foiled by hero interference. One of those opportunities involved a disc that he gave to Creati after opening her stomach. Unfortunately Creati lost it after Phoenix tree found out and held her children hostage. Now it was right in front of her face…**

La Brava: I have more…information that you could possibly imagine…names, locations, plans…**She smirked** It all sits on my computer, safe and sound.

Makoto: You’re playing a dangerous game waving around something that could prove my Dad’s innocence. How did you get that anyway, Creati lost it when Phoenix tree came after her.

La Brava: It’s not important how I got the video. I found it and I’ve been keeping it safe, but now I’m offering it to you.

Makoto: Why are you doing this for us?

La Brava: Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, I know you’ll need this disc if you want to dismantle Phoenix tree. **She held the disc out**

**Makoto hesitantly takes it from between her fingers.** Makoto: Does your husband know you’re out here? **She jolted as the short woman momentarily squealed like a school girl before straightening up.**

La Brava: Nope, he still doesn’t know. **She chuckled and twirled one of her curly locks around her finger** My Gentle is a busy man.

Makoto: Then this meeting never happened. **She stood up and grabbed her brother.**

La Brava: It was nice doing business with you.

**Makoto led her brother out the cafe, she clutched that disc close to heart.**

Makoto: Dad could’ve lived if Creati hadn’t lost this.

**Shiryu didn’t respond, he could only hope the evidence he heard about was as good as the hacker said it was.**

**Class 1-A sat in the common area collectively worried about Sophie. Kita was the only one not present being worried about his ex. The others were huddled on the couch.**

Hatori: I’m worried. Is there no update on her condition?

Akumu: From my knowledge no.

Maybe if you did as you were told she wouldn’t be in this position. **They look over their shoulders to see their upperclassmen. Natsumi Toyomitsu, Sendo Hadou, Momoko Togata, and Tenshi Usagiyama. The latter of them looked at them with contempt.**

Hahena: **Pissed** You know you’ve got a lot of nerve pointing a finger at us! We didn’t do anything!

Tenshi: Correction, you didn’t do anything right. You couldn’t follow the simplest instructions and now one of you newbie’s got hurt. You all think you’re hot shit because of your parents when you only bring shame. **He unfurled his large wings.**

Hatori: What’s that supposed to mean?

Momoko: It means if you losers know what’s good for you you’ll remember your place. **The frog girl flinches away as her upperclassman flashes her fangs at her.**

Akumu: “Remember your place?”

**Natsumi floated in between them.** Natsumi: We didn’t come to start a fight, we came to check on our juniors, right?

Sendo: Right…we just wanted to see how everyone was holding up.

**Tamashiro winced at his recently mended bullet wound. He was handcuffed to a table when the door to the interrogation room opened.**

**The Chief of Police entered along with another officer.** Chief: **He sits across from Tamashiro with the officer at a file cabinet.** Good morning, Tamashiro.

Tamashiro: Piss off…

Chief: I’m not here to hurt you, I just want to ask a few questions about Phoenix tree.

Tamashiro: Oh so now you believe they exist? 

**He ignored the quip as the officer pulled a file out of the cabinet.** Chief: Do you know anything about their leadership?

Tamashiro: We didn’t think they had any leadership seeing as we killed most of them, no thanks to you.

**The chief grunted at the comment but didn’t retaliate.** Chief: Then did you know any of their plans?

Tamashiro: I don’t know, we never got a chance to ask while we had heroes breathing down our necks!

Chief: The reason nobody listened to you is because you’re a bunch of common criminals.

Tamashiro: Half of us “common criminals” were heroes you didn’t want to listen to, one of which almost got the death sentence without a trial. Speaking of him, did you ever bother to check on Mineta’s kids after you buried him for something he didn’t even do?

Chief: What we do with his kids are none of my concern.

Tamashiro: Of course not *scoff* I mean all you did was stick four volatile kids with the same people who used to kick the shit out of their dad. Definitely nothing wrong with that.

Chief: This isn’t about his kids. **He leaned forward** it’s about Phoenix tree.

Tamashiro: Well two of those kids seem to be the only ones doing something about it. Meanwhile you only seem to care about covering up your mistake. Face it, you’re embarrassed not only because you got played into doing their dirty work. But also because the person whose name you dragged made you all look like fools right before you killed him in cold blood.

**The chief leaned back in his seat with a scowl** Chief: Why are you telling me all this?

Tamashiro: Because they played me too, I almost played right into their hands when Mineta stopped me. That’s why I joined Black Thesis, and that’s why I’m helping his kids finish what their Dad started, because it’s the least I could do.

Chief: Helping them how?

Tamashiro: Apparently that information leak fifteen years ago wasn’t enough to prove Phoenix tree even existed. The press painted it as a terrorist attack that put us in deep shit.

Chief: And how do you suppose that information could’ve changed things?

Tamashiro: Maybe you’d stop trying to capture us and stop pissing on his name. The latter is all his kids are after anyway.

Chief: What would you do in my position?

Tamashiro: Maybe swallow my pride and admit I was wrong about an accusation so these kids can live in peace? Maybe keep the public from slandering his name and give them a break?

Chief: You do realize how bad that would look on the media don’t you?

Tamashiro: And you realize that’s exactly how it was for Mineta right? Fighting tooth and nail to prove his innocence while the news threw every insult in the book at him, and turned the entire country against him?

Chief: We can’t just admit we were wrong…what it would do the the public’s trust in the system…

Tamashiro: Well you should’ve thought about that before getting all of Japan hyped up over a lie.

**Chief sighed as the officer passed him a drink.** Chief: …I’ll consider what you said.

**The chief steps out into the hallway to find Lady Nagant and Keigo Takami, formerly known as Hawks.**

Chief: I’m not distressed.

Keigo: Didn’t say you were.

**He grunted and took a sip of his coffee** Chief: Why are you two here? Another recon mission on your agenda?

Keigo: Nagant here wanted to make sure the runaway she shot hadn’t kicked the bucket yet.

Nagant: He needs some medical attention but he’ll live **She leaned her cheek on her hand** I’d be more concerned with getting information out of him.

Keigo: We have two kids who affected by the same quirk singularity mutation that turned Shigaraki into a monster. We don’t know if they’re as strong as him but they’re very dangerous and crafty. We need to bring them in without killing either of them.

Chief: That’s if you even find them.

Keigo: They’ll turn up eventually, they’re hell bent on making sure their Dad’s good deeds don’t go unnoticed.Even if his last good deed got messy…

**The chief nodded with a look of contemplation** Chief: I’ll be heading back inside, take care you two.

**In a vineyard 6.2 miles away from the city, Makoto woke up in her grand parents’ old house. She only knew about this place from her Dad’s memories and even he only came here once. She rolled out of her grandmother’s bed and walked into the dark hallway.**

**Her footsteps thumped softly against the wooden floor as she went down stairs. The building was completely dark aside from the faint light of the moon coming in through the windows**

**Her grandmother’s robe fits perfectly, strange there wasn’t much info on her other than that she died giving birth. Shiryu was sound asleep in Grandpa Daigo’s room, though it took some convincing.**

Makoto: **She yawned and made her way into the kitchen. The kitchen was still and quiet all except for the faint sounds of the wind**

**Why the hell was there still edible food here despite its inhabitants being dead for years, Makoto didn’t know. She grabbed some caviar and crackers, typical rich people shit.**

**She munched on the crackers and caviar as she walked back into the living room. The furniture in the living room was still and dusty, the carpet was covered in dust and dirt with a stain in front of the tv, which was still on**

What are you doing up? **Makoto looks towards the couch where Kayla took up most of it. Being a Nomu she probably didn’t need much sleep.**

Makoto: Couldn’t stay that way.

Kayla: That much is clear.

**She patted the couch beside her**

**Instead Makoto curled up in her lap which was surprisingly warm for a reanimated corpse.** Makoto: I don’t know what I’m doing.

Kayla: I think you do.

**Kayla played with her hair like a mother would.**

Makoto: My whole fuckin’ life I hated the league of villains for all the shit they’d done only to be treated like victims. I keep telling myself that I’m doing this because my dad got treated worse than villains. But if we go too far…they’ll just bury us right next to Dad.

Kayla: You’re scared of going too far aren’t you?

Makoto: I’m scared that my brother and I might have set ourselves up for a fate worse than death…because our Dad’s high school perversions superseded everything else.

Kayla: You’re afraid of what would happen to you if you’re captured. 

**Makoto buried her face into Kayla’s chest. The fact that a reanimated corpse is more comforting than her actual guardian ever was was a hard pill to swallow.**

Makoto: They almost executed Dad without a trial, long before any of what happened while he was running from everyone. 

Kayla: I remember, my master is the reason he escaped after he sent my sister.

**Kayla ran her fingers through Makoto’s hair.**

Makoto: What are they going to do to me, not to sound like Himiko Toga but I actually haven’t killed anyone yet.

Kayla: Knowing they’re methods, you’ll be charged with something worse than any regular killer.

**Kayla placed a hand on her head**

Kayla: But you’ll be fine as long as you don’t let fear of going too far consume you.

Makoto: If only it were that easy… **She dipped a cracker into caviar. God she hated rich people sometimes.**

Kayla: You’re right, it’s not easy for someone like you.

**Kayla smiled softly and wiped the crumbs off her face**

Kayla: But I’m sure you can handle it, I know you can.

Makoto: Dad’s memories make you out to be a hard ass, but you’re alright.

Kayla: You wouldn’t be the first person to tell me that.

Makoto: What am I gonna do with this disc we have? Dad could’ve proved his innocence without any bloodshed.

Kayla: If he could have he would have.

**She ruffled the kids’ hair**

Kayla: It’s best not to dwell on what could’ve been.

Makoto: I don’t want to die. Dad was ready to die when he thought he lost mom…and me. He was ready to die finishing the job and avenge Uncle Denki once he believed he had nothing left. **She looked up at Kayla, whose pure yellow eyes glowed in the dark and the transparent top of her head that showing her brain.** Does that make me weak?

Kayla: Everyone has a breaking point, and it’s normal to be afraid of going that far.

**She brushed her hair out of her face.**

Kayla: What matters is how you handle it when you get there.

**Makoto nuzzled into Kayla’s chest, it was nice and comforting but also weird given the fact that Kayla was a reanimated corpse**

Makoto: I’m afraid…

Kayla: I know.

My first plan was to make a simple stand that would sit on the counter. After a few sketches, I designed it to fit onto my jar where I hold extra grounds. The perpendicular supports are beveled so the grounds don’t just sit on top when they are scraped off. There’s also two shallow slots to help lift it out. When I’m done with it, I can just flip it over and it sits neatly under my jar for storage. This was a fun iterative process!",17,1744298002.0,functionalprint,2,0.95,False
1jw0bu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanRestoreConnect/comments/1jw0bu8/how_to_clean_a_keurig/,How To Clean A Keurig,"# The Ultimate Guide to Cleaning Your Keurig (From a Professional Cleaner's Perspective)

Coffee lovers, let's talk about that trusty Keurig sitting on your counter. You know, the one quietly accumulating mineral buildup and coffee residue while faithfully brewing your daily cups. As an experienced cleaner, I can tell you that neglecting your Keurig maintenance is a recipe for disaster.

According to Sarah Bogdan from Good Housekeeping, ""The most common complaint with Keurigs is that they stop working or don't brew as well over time – and nine times out of ten, it's because people don't clean them regularly.""

Think of your Keurig like your car - skip the maintenance and you'll eventually find yourself caffeine-stranded during that crucial Monday morning meeting!

## Why Regular Cleaning is Non-Negotiable

* Ensures consistently great-tasting coffee
* Prevents machine malfunctions and breakdowns
* Extends your Keurig's operational lifespan
* Saves money on premature replacement costs
* Maintains optimal brewing temperature and flow

## Essential Cleaning Steps (15-Minute Process)

1. **Safety first**: Unplug the machine completely
2. **External cleaning**: Wipe down surfaces with a damp cloth
3. **Disassemble components**: Remove reservoir, drip tray, and K-cup holder
4. **Wash removable parts**: Use warm, soapy water (never submerge the base!)
5. **Clear blockages**: Use a paperclip to carefully clean exit needle and pod holder
6. **Descaling solution**: Fill reservoir with equal parts white vinegar and water
7. **Run cleaning cycles**: Process the solution through until reservoir empties
8. **Rinse thoroughly**: Run multiple fresh water cycles until vinegar smell disappears
9. **Replace water filter**: After soaking new filter for 5 minutes (if applicable)
10. **Reassemble and test**: Run one water-only cycle to ensure proper function

## AVOID THESE COMMON MISTAKES

| DON'T DO THIS | WHY IT'S HARMFUL |
|---------------|------------------|
| Use harsh chemicals | Damages components and affects taste |
| Submerge the base in water | Causes electrical damage/failure |
| Clean with metal tools | Can damage delicate needle and internal parts |
| Skip regular maintenance | Results in clogging and performance issues |
| Rush the rinse cycle | Leaves cleaning solution residue that affects taste |

## Professional Maintenance Schedule

For optimal performance, follow this cleaner-approved schedule:
* **Daily**: Wipe exterior, empty drip tray
* **Weekly**: Clean K-cup holder, rinse reservoir
* **Monthly**: Clean needle assembly, check filter
* **Every 3 months**: Complete descaling process (more frequently with hard water)

## Final Thoughts

Maintaining your Keurig doesn't require professional skills - just consistency. The small effort of running vinegar solutions and cleaning components pays massive dividends in coffee quality and machine longevity. 

I recommend setting calendar reminders for your quarterly deep clean. Your morning brew will taste noticeably better, and you'll avoid that dreaded ""brewing incomplete"" message that always seems to happen when you need caffeine the most!

Take 15 minutes today to assess your Keurig's condition. Your taste buds will thank you, and your machine will continue serving perfect cups for years to come.

For more detailed instructions and helpful visuals, check out the [complete Keurig cleaning guide](https://cleanrestoreconnect.com/how-to-clean-a-keurig/) that I summarized here.

1jw0bsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jw0bsf/tasting_is_improving/,Tasting is improving,"I've been trying to taste notes in coffee for months. I started with espresso and then moved to pourover because handgrinding for it wouldn't hurt an injury I got. Admittedly, I don't have a grinder that has been deemed good for pourover (KINGrinder k4). But just now, I finally got something that I think is what everyone calls juicy!

All these descriptors and notes about coffee have gone over my head, but I think I know what juicy tastes like.

I used Dak ""happy birthday Kofio"" which is a natural processed Huila, Colombia. My first two brews were bitter and astringent, which discouraged me. I tried to grind courser with no avail, but then I tried lower temp and a little less water (on accident I ran out leaving 20 grams to go).

I did 30g, shaken in blind shaker, then bloomed for 1 minute, and poured water until it filled the 2 cup v60, then topped up the water until 480g total. All of it in 3 minutes. As it cooled down, the acidity made it feel and taste like juice. I gave some to my wife to see if she thought the same and she was surprised to say the same calling it fruity.

Now I still have to figure out the if I can taste the notes on the box. I'm aiming to get a better grinder (probably K-Ultra or Ode gen 2). It's exciting to finally, after months taste/feel something everyone mentions. ",2,1744297998.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

40 Male- 40 Female couple USA/NYC

 

We flew Singapore Airlines from JFK-SIN-DPS. My first time on Singapore airlines.  We booked “Premium Economy” exit row. What we didn’t realize is that on this flight there is no Economy class. Only First, Business and premium economy. So essentially if you are Premium economy you are in Economy class. Regardless, the seats were comfortable enough, and the food was impressive. The exit row provided unlimited leg room, making it easy to stand up to stretch or use the facilities.

 

We arrived at DPS around 11am and our hotel provided free pickup from the airport.

We met our driver and headed to Ubud. We stayed at Ubud village hotel. The Hotel was on the main drag right in the middle of town. However once inside, the chaos of the main street was nonexistent. The property was very quiet and serene. We had a room facing the pool. The room was very clean and spacious with a very large balcony. The pool area was also very nice, with comfortable loungers and friendly staff offering towels. The pool area also had a bar with happy hour specials.

On our arrival day we just walked around town for a bit and had an early dinner. We went to sleep early from the jetlag.

Day 2 we woke up early, went to a local coffee shop and had a light breakfast. Next, we walked down the road to the monkey forest. We spent a few hours there walking around and taking in the scenery. Afterwards we walked up to Ubud palace and Ubud water temple. Had lunch and visited the market.

 

 

Day 3 we hired a driver using Get your guide. Our driver picked us up at 8am. We headed to 3 different waterfalls, the famous water temple, rice terrace and a coffee plantation. The guide was great, and I highly recommend using get your guide to arrange a private tour.

 

Day 4 we arranged a ride with our hotel to take us to our next location, Sanur beach.

In Sanur we stayed at Hotel 101. Another great stay. We had a room on the first level with direct access to the pool. There are two pools at this hotel, I would recommend trying to have a room near the pool in the rear.  The front pool seemed a bit overcrowded and noisy.

Sanur overall was a good fit for us, it has an older more laidback crowd. But still, lots to see and do. We checked out an Irish pub that had live music (the wicked parrot).

Day 5 we just walked around town and visited some shops and the beach, nothing important to mention.

Day 6 we used Grab for a ride the Sanur harbor. We used Setia ferry to take us to Nusa Lembongon. The ferry was great, and the boarding process was very organized.

Once on Nusa Lembongon we stayed at Lembongon Summer hotel. The hotel is made up of 4 private bungalows. Each with a mini plunge pool. We were very impressed with how nice this stay was. It was close to the main road but far enough back to be quiet and peaceful.   On NL there are no cars. Only motor bikes and mini pickup trucks (taxis). We opted to not rent motor bikes and instead use the taxis or walk.  

Day 7 we arranged a SCUBA diving trip with Legend divers, and it was a great day. We went to manta point and got to dive with giant manta rays.

Day 8 we took a taxi to dream beach and spent the day at D’bayus beach club. It was a small beach bar that served light food and was playing some great music. Very relaxing day.

 

Three restaurants to mention on NL.  Little Prema BBQ for fresh grilled fish, Lemongrass for pizza and cocktails and Curry traders for Indian and cocktails.

 

Day 9 we headed back to the mainland and arranged a ride using Klook. Our driver met us in the ferry arrivals area and easily took us to Kuta to our hotel Grandmas Plus Hotel Legian. The hotel was fine for one night, no complaints. It is right in the middle of town, so plenty to do. We got some small tattoos at Rose tattoo Bali. Good clean shop with treasonable prices. Both tattoos came out nice.  Later, we walked over to the beach and hung out at one of the beach bars for sunset.  

 

Final day we once again used Klook for a 4am pick up to take us to the airport. The driver was there on time and got us to the airport without any issues. 

 

To wrap it all up, this was my first time to Bali, and I was a bit apprehensive at first. I usually try to avoid visiting overly touristic places.  However, I really enjoyed our quick trip and would defiantly like to return for a longer visit.

Best options?,"I used to drink 2–3 cups of coffee a day: one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and sometimes a treat coffee if I’m feeling low energy or out running errands. What started as a routine became necessity, and now with costs of everything going up, I need to save wherever I can.

Between the creamer, filters, occasional drive-thru visits, and even replacing my coffee maker last year, I was spending way more than I thought on something I wasn’t even enjoying that much anymore. I’ve also been having some stomach issues lately and coffee’s making me feel bloated and a little acid-refluxy. 

And the fact that basically everything is about to become more expensive, I cannot afford to spend whatever extra money I have on coffee of all thingsSo this past month, I have been using caffeine gums as a replacement. My daughter sometimes uses them and I asked her to get me some. I got a 9 piece pack for 4$, with each piece at 50mg caffeine. It works just as you would expect

After a week, I did the math:

My usual coffee costs (home-brew + occasional café): about $9–12/week

Caffeine gum: $4–6/week, depending on brand and how many I use

That’s around $20–30 in savings per month, not even counting the creamer, almond milk, sugar, etc. This is just going to be my reality from now on, saving whatever I can wherever I can. I’m not saying I’ll never have coffee again, but at least I have an alternative until idk things change?

The only thing I’m still figuring out is which gum is best for the money. Some are a little chalky, some taste great but are pricey, and some I’m not sure about the ingredients. I’m still not committed to a brand and still trying them out, so I’m open to any suggestions as well

If you’ve tried caffeine gum or mints, i would like to know what worked for you in terms of:

Price per serving

Taste

1jw045u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jw045u/last_grain_of_sand/,last grain of sand,"So, I have a theory. I know it really isn’t true, but a romantic soul can’t help the way they are right….Well kind of anyway! I always loved hour glasses. The fascination of the sand sliding through the hole in the centre and how they were initially captured, sealed and measured. In fact, for some reason the innate need for our creative need is a fascination. I am not the only person it intrigues. From cave paintings and crystal circles to a freshly designed viral product I get seduced.

I grew up with a friend I always thought had a great imagination. Her dreams were wild and she always had a story about something. although our relationship waxed and waned through the years we never really fell out and we never really had to convince each other we were friends. The thing really started for us when we had been given some tickets for a film. Julie was her middle name, and she hated her more unusual first name met me in town. We don’t live in a big place but it’s on the coast in wild surrounding countryside. We have a few busses a day that take us out and there’s no train here. We had a meal at a local pub. We were at a time of spending more time around each other and life was good.

Julie had always been a bit reclusive and quiet, and I wasn’t exactly a lioness off to parties or anything either. She was hard working. Diligent sensible and yet her dreams were like films. I would have conversations with her how she had woken from this epic scene with a gunman on the run or a spaceship facing an anomaly worthy of star trek. Years ago, I bought her a leatherbound folder styled book from a local witchy styled market. It became her Christmas present, and she began writing her dreams down in it the lady selling it had a real quirky style, and I had also bought her home-made remedies for cold sores and eczema. My brother’s kid was suffering badly till that cream and body wash hit its skin and the cold sores settled on me after the first application during an eruption.

Julie and I were both in relationships, but they were both not the happiest at the time. Us being together always helped us to buffer the doldrums of home and work. We felt the cold as we walked to the local theatre but I swung my bag and Julie scraped her feet, giggling together like we had done many times before. We were a bit late but still in time to find our seats and fill our laps with snacks. I felt it took a while to get started but it held my attention. Not being an action loving person I was not sure it was the best film for me but tickets were free and so were we. About 20 minutes in Julie gasped and grabbed my hand her eyes glued to the screen. I tensed almost as much as she did. Unsure of what was happening I now found it tough to watch the film whilst worrying what was wrong with her. Finally disturbed her enough to ascertain she was ok and feel calmer about the situation but still not risking trying a full conversation. The next hour or so I was free to think with one half of my head as to what caused her reaction but then there was head shaking  confusion and some type of realisation for her.

Eager to find out just what occurred I was rushing Julie out to get the low down on the whole episode I just witnessed. Julie got outside and bent herself taking deep breaths. Eyes wide as she stood looking at me. I was searching her face ardently as she tripped over every word “my dream…it was…I’m sure…I know it…its in the book…you,  I…I wrote”

“Stop take a breath, make sense Julie!” I guess we were both searching each others faces. She put her shaking hand on her heart and swallowed. “That film was my dream Alex.  I recognised it. I mean at the start it wasn’t but the whole story…..ahhh like how it was styled it was like someone shared my dream and actually made it into a film?” My hands were in my pockets and I was tumbling the hourglass on my keyring. I often fiddled and one of the ways I cope with it is to just have something appropriate. I swallowed and searched for what to say and all I came up with was “ahhhhh show me!”

 

Julie had small rivulets of tear drops either side of her face. Her cheeks red and her eyes still like dishes she nodded at me like I was offering her something she wanted and I guess in a way I was just by believing her. Not questioning her or anything meant she could gather her thoughts and regain some composure. We had to go our separate ways right then but met a couple of days later I the local coffee and sandwich shop. The Bakewell tarts and lunch time rolls were great and coffee wasn’t bad. Julie brought the book and showed me the entry. I must of read it 3 or 4 times. It really was so close to the film. I scanned the passages the car chase the characters and the similarities just were astounding. We laughed I mean at the end of the day it was incredulous and stupid to do much else.

I thought that was it I mean after all it was really good but there were a few differences and she herself said I don’t always remember the finish or the start and sometimes there are jumps or black spots. Over the next year or so well we would mention it and we kind of thought it was a one off till late one Thursday afternoon I had a few missed calls on my phone from her. I retrieved the voicemail and she was frantic…someone was reading a book and told Sarah and Julie about it. She had the same feeling and so bought the book. The synopsis was in short one of her dream notes but the book itself though thin was a much deeper descriptive setting and character build. She read it swiftly over the next few days and married it up to her dream schedule. One thing that seemed a great thing was she always dated her entries. I confess I read the dream diary and the book and somehow it all married up and buffered out her visions.

We decided that it was still just coincidence that we had discovered these two stories and the though the similarities were uncanny I mean how many stories can there be. Someone could easily come up with these scenarios couldn’t they and make them into something public. We left it till the Friday night before Mike her boyfriend’s birthday. Sarah her sister joined us and a smoke and a drink or 3 later were starting the story of the book and the film. Julie showed everyone the dream book and goosebumps were on every one of our bodies as we talked and reasoned what could be going on.

I had been back to the market and the ladies stall was there but she was not. I mean they guys and ladies running it were nice and the stuff I bought always seemed to help any ailments I asked for help with but somehow her lack of presence did seem to make it less miraculous. I asked when she would be there and missed one week she was expected but did manage to turn up another. I had started explaining the things that were happening and though she took interest she was really busy at the time and so I left with one of her business cards. It all didn’t really feel right but what came out of the Friday night meant me taking that card and calling her.

Sarah and Mike were quite in awe of the story at first but then Sarah decided to be dismissive. Mike on the other hand turned his brain over and asked to read her dream book. Julie refused. She felt she would be violated by giving him unfiltered access. Mike however stood his ground and told her that she was being silly. In the end she relented, and he decided over the next few weeks to read his way through. By the time Julie got back to me asking me to go over I had let that night go into the back of my mind.

Mike had a note pad, and he showed us things on you tube and in his notes that identified 2 more dreams very clearly. I saw the look on Julie’s face and it was just like being back in the cinema with her…I was wordless, and the hourglass spun between my fingers in my pocket the flowing of the sand calming me even without seeing it.

I felt like an army of mini men were digging and walking all over my brain inside my head. Julie was clutching a pillow feeling like a freak and rocking herself trying to soothe. Mike was really excitable as he showed us a game Julie froze and said “I know this place…..there’s a big temple over the mountain and a monster there that tries to kill you.” Mike was like “yeah My brother and I played it I recognised the familiarity in my head when reading your dream.”  There was a period of stunned and award silence. All of us just looking at this book and staring. Julie just lost it she grabbed the book and went to the bedroom closing the door and crying. I was as lost as they were and made my excuses to go home.

The next day Julie and I spoke. Between the 3 of us we decided to post up her dream stories online and ask anyone if they had read or seen anything similar. We were inundated. I mean not right away but within a week we had lots of people confirming films, books and even a couple of strange websites and things that all somehow seemed to have hugely close to uncanny similarities to Julies dreams. I called a few times and in the end left a voicemail. I had explained about my friend and her dreams and her diary right in the book I’d been sold. The similarities and experiences we were having. The reply was short and asking her to meet us. She did say she would happily travel. By now we knew over half the book of dreams was in some way represented and some were so close when Julie saw them she would cry and remember things so vividly.

Mike and I were just amazed at the similarities, descriptions and even I guess in some respects the dialogues or costumes. By now even Sarah had been convinced there was some credence to the situation and had begun looking herself for other things from the diary. We could not meet the lady until well into the next week and in some way we all felt like we were going crazy trying to make sense of things. Julie and Mike had never published any personal details all communications were conducted through the web sites used to post the examples.

When we sat down to wait we were nervous. Mike drove us into the town we were meeting in and we took a table in a small local pub as suggested and managed a nook near the back. When she arrived the atmosphere did change to a somewhat relaxed and almost sleepy uninterested feel from those around us. It had not been the case when we arrived. Being a rural local many eyebrows were raised and little head nods in our direction.

She ordered and I guided her over upon sitting down she looked at Julie and it was almost as if she were psychically assessing her. I mean yes I had met the lady, and yes I have spent a little time around her, and yes I found her strange and quirky. Her dress was relaxed and colourful yet unconventional. The soft leather boots looked as if they came from a fairy grotto and her mass of dirty blonde and silver curled hair swept around her shoulders. Morrigan slid her hand across the table and looked deeply at Julie as they met skin to skin and both had a smile as she introduced herself.

Julie seemed calmer than she had in ages. Mike decided to bring out his laptop and Morrigan shook her head. Julie had her book in front of her and Morrigan refused to read or touch it. She took a deep breath and splayed her hands wide on the table she relaxed her shoulders and quietly began to speak. Her eyes sparkled and her face animated so nicely. “I am a herbalist, I don’t have great powers but I have intrinsic knowledge. I can channel people and their needs. I made that book and when I did I could feel you. You and your friend who bought the book for you.” Her eye darted to me and she took another deep breath. “Whilst making the book I knew it was something you needed. I embedded magic into the sleeve and pages. This did nothing more than help you feel a comfort in writing here!” she pointed at the book and looked with a soft intent into Julies eyes. “I knew one day we would meet, I knew you were more powerful than I but in your own way.” Julies back was rigid Mike was transfixed and Morrigan sipped her drink. “What am I? Who am I? What ..”  Morrigan cut her short by raising her hand. “Julie this is not easy to explain. You are what some call a creative well. When you sleep you dream so deeply and  so vividly but you also project these dreams into the creative consciences of artists and writers and creators alike. Sometimes they cannot fully get those ideas. Sometimes there is no start or you miss the ending and you cannot ever recapture that essence as it has gone. Sometimes someone else adds those details and at times that changes the story somewhat but whenever your beacon is lit up and productive someone can potentially receive it.”

All of us were sat like we had been given a gobstopper that made us only able to think. Julie was quietly crying and Mike didn’t know if he was happy, confused or wanted to run from his freaky partner. Even I was not able to begin contemplating the ramifications of this. Morrigan took out a small book she sat it down on the table and all 8 fingers delicately placed on it. Sliding it over to Julie she smiled. “This is all I know and also those close to me. You are a rare and precious person. I’ve asked those within my circle and everything we can impart is in here. From people to contact and speak to or just base knowledge. If you wished, you could be made very comfortable. There are those who would happily pay you a lot of money and furnish your life or you can remain as you are anonymous.”

Mike sat up and put his hands on the table edge. His feet kicking below like a child. He looked at Julie and reached his arm around her. She fell into his body and Morrigan reached again into her bag. Pointing at Julie she sighed. “This book is near finished for pages and whether you choose to go ahead or not, I had the feeling that you would want to keep writing!” sliding a new book for writing in forward I could see there was an hourglass on the cover in the top corner. In the centre bluebells that are Julie’s favourite springtime flower and along the bottom she had put babies building blocks. Down the spine were dragon flies 5 of them. Sarah loved them. Over the back there was an old type well, mushrooms around the base, and just above there were a pair of owls..  Julie ran her hands over gently as if she almost scared to really touch and Morrigan smiled. She nodded to us all. “I must go. I fear you have enough to talk about for now. I’ll come and see you soon I know this is not the last time I will see you.” I nodded and said “I have your number!”

She seemed to move silently from the booth and we were left with our thoughts and Julie was in some way relieved but shocked at her revelations. Mike was no better and I noticed how we were again getting head nods and verbal aspersions. We finished our drinks and left Julie and Mike carrying the books to the car and I sat next to them all the way home.

 

Less than a month later Julie had called me to tell me she was expecting and so was her sister. She laughed and said there were 6 blocks on the book and 3 of us and though Julie and Sarah and I had all been friends from living in the same street and we were very close I pooh pooed away till I had to ring back and tell her I was also pregnant just over a week later. Morrigan did indeed see us again. Julie decided after reading the other book that for now she knew as much as she wanted to. She decided to raise her baby for the first few years and have the next. Our first babies were all born within 2 months of each other mine last. Julie and Mike were closer than they had ever been. He chose to keep her ability secret. I think it made him feel more for her.  I became single very quickly realising that we were not happy for a reason. Sarah became an earth mother and second mum to our two. She was happier than she ever had been and began a childminding service that had a waiting list. I never had another child, but Julie had twins and Sarah had another a few months after that.

Morrigan became a fixture slowly in our lives. Always a remedy ready for our issues and she really helped Sarah when she decided she was going to explore her ability and its rewards. She only ever wanted security for her family and after some phone calls and some waiting around and some secretive meetings she was indeed made comfortable and given assurance that her ability was indeed genuine and that since she decided to come forward they would look after her and her family in any way she wanted.

Oh by the way, my theory was a rather childlike development. I used to wonder if the last grain of sand was the first to come back through the hole in the glass. I wished I could colour it make it somehow different so I could see it travel each time through the system. I’ve spent hours watching different glasses tip and refill. I’ve timed them seeing how accurate they are. Fascinated by the most gentle and simple of things, yet knowing one of the most strangely gifted people. They say there are several wells of imagination feeding the artists of this world. Only those they know of. Morrigan never knew another but she spoke of other magically gifted people. We all agreed she was indeed certainly magically gifted herself. She never credited or admitted her talents. We were all destroyed when she left this world but we all know some days she’s with us in some way. The smell in the room somehow changed to her herby neroli based scent and somehow things would feel better.

 I inherited a book of her recipes a box full of pestle and mortar and herbs and tools. I started dabbling. I’m not claiming I have her talent but I feel good when I can help someone with their pain or skin etc. I think she wanted me to have my own special power as to be fair I have not yet got it wrong. I sometimes get a feeling I should add something or leave something out or put a little extra and somehow it always seems to work out. It’s a comfort using her tools I feel like her energy resides in there and Sarah feels the same.

Julie continues to dream and find similarities and the people who are her carers are just a phone call away. She has a really lovely quiet confidence now and she doesn’t have to work neither does Mike but they do have projects and volunteer etc. Julie is finally ok with her ability and though she still doesn’t quite understand it she kind of likes being a conduit for the creative souls in the world.",2,1744297455.0,stories,1,1.0,False

During these events, she looses her personality and lacks most self awareness to the level that she can potentially injure herself. Neurological vet thinks it's probably neurological, but no great way to test for it and likely less opportunity for treatment. Looking to see if there might be someone here with ideas.

  
\* Species: Domestic cat  
\* Age: 16  
\* Sex/Neuter status: F spayed  
\* Breed: shorthair  
\* Body weight: 11 lb  
\* History: Has diabetes and receives 1.5 u twice per day. Adopted by me in 2021. In very good health otherwise, and if the shelter hadn't installed the chip when she was a kitten, I'd never believe she's older than maybe 7. She eats one full can of Friskies in a day. She seems to get enough water. Her litter box shows no abnormalities.  
\* Clinical signs: See below. Diabetes seems to be unrelated.  
\* Duration: Can last 1-7 hours; happens every 1-8 weeks  
\* Your general location: Northeast US  
\* Links to any test results, X-rays, vet reports etc. that you have: N/A

  
Symptoms:

1. Trance starts seemingly randomly. No notable pattern that gives you a heads up she's about to enter one. The one she's having now came out of nowhere a couple minutes after having her lunch-time treats, where she was normal.
   1. I work from home, so I experience most of these first hand and can help her out while they're occurring if needed.
2. She walks/paces around non-stop, constantly sniffing. Her direction is usually aimless, though tends to stick to edges of the rooms she's in. Her walk sometimes appears weak, or lazy, especially later in the episode. She doesn't stop moving during the episode.
3. An episode lasts usually at least one hour, but it has been as long as 6-7 hours. And the whole time she doesn't stop pacing.
4. She easily gets stuck in corners and tight spots, or awkwardly climbs over things she could walk around, like she's on some sort of autopilot. She will get stuck occasionally; she loses all directional problem solving skills. She doesn't know how to back up. She'll climb over things in front of her rather than walk around them, and can get herself stuck doing this.
5. She tends to purr loudly throughout the whole thing.
6. Her pupils look normal.
7. She shows no evidence of pain and no typical seizure symptoms like spasms or inability to move/walk.
8. She lacks any of her normal personality. It's almost like she's on the ""base feline operating system"" but that her identity-specific software wasn't installed.
   1. She investigates, moves around, is more friendly than normal (not that she's not friendly, but she's not actively affectionate normally), will lick you if your hand is in front of her (not normal), and seems okay with being held and picked up (she doesn't like this normally). When you pick her up normally, she makes a squeak to indicate her displeasure; in the trance, that's gone.
   2. She also will defend herself, scratch, and hiss if she believes you're in her way or a minor threat to her goal of walking/investigating. She may do this when playing normally, but this clearly is more a scared/annoyed behavior. This doesn't happen a lot; really only if I'm in her way trying to get too close (like holding her to keep her from moving).
   3. She must have gone to the bathroom during a recent episode but before I returned home. While she knew the bathroom is ""place where I deposit waste"" (base feline operating system, I assume), she didn't make it into the litter box (identity-specific software install).
9. She can walk, but will not hop or jump. To get on the couch, she uses her claws to climb up--very awkward. To walk from the couch to the coffee table, she'd normally hop, but instead takes long, risky strides. To get down from the couch, she sort-of gracefully falls, a lazy hop, basically.
   1. This was from an early episode; now I no longer let her on furniture during an episode and normally keep her contained in my office.
10. She lacks dexterity. Specifically, she has trouble dislodging her claws once she gets them in something. As she walks, she may bump into something with her leg and continue as if it didn't happen. It's as if her extremities are separate, controlled by their own brain.
11. She'll *always* eat. But in these episodes, she reacts to the sound of shaking kibble in her bowl--knowing that means ""good""--but once she gets there, won't eat it. She will sometimes to react to her normal wet food, though she needs help eating it, e.g., holding the bowl up for her. She loses her ability to bite or grab with her mouth and instead licks at it like ice cream. She doesn't tend to eat until later on in an episode. Food does not seem to impact her mental state.
12. The come-down process has a clear start, which is her finally sitting.
   1. Slowly her personality returns.
   2. Eventually she starts hopping/jumping again.
   3. She returned to her preferred spot on the floor about 10 min after sitting and laid in her normal spread-out state.
   4. A little after that she started loafing again.
   5. She doesn't seem tired or exhausted (like most seizures I've seen result in).
   6. I'd say she was back to normal, seemingly without any impact, about 20-30 min after she first sat.
13. These happen every one to eight-or-so weeks and have been occurring for maybe a year or so.
14. I'm posting today because she fell down the staircase due to her lack of dexterity and now I need to child-proof the house. She lives on both levels and likes her freedom. I'm concerned normal-she will be unhappy with the protections, but trance-she arrives unpredictably. I don't really think I have a choice.
15. I have a few plants in the house including a large parlor palm that she sometimes has an interest in scrounging a little dirt from the pot, but they should all be non-toxic. I look up toxicity of any plants ahead of purchase and I only have 3 live plants, all basically out of reach from her.

Vet response:

1. Emergency vet found no issues when I brought her in during one of her early episodes late-night last year. Her blood sugar was normal for her diabetes status. They scheduled her for a neuro consult.
2. Neurologist doesn't see evidence of anything either, though acknowledges it's likely a neuro event. I shared various videos of her interactions once another episode occurred, but that didn't help much.
   1. MRI and other scans were discussed, but the Dr said she didn't really expect much out of it. Said go for it if you'd like, but be realistic on expectations.
   2. Because the episodes are so infrequent, even if there was some sort of treatment outcome of scans, Dr said it would be hard to tell if any treatment is working.

Basically, I feel awful when she's in these--she must get SO tired!--but there doesn't seem to be much I can do other than cat-proof the place so she hopefully doesn't get hurt if it happens while I'm not home or can't pay attention at the start (like today). 

But I wanted to toss this out to see if anyone else has experience here and might have some ideas. Her quality of life is otherwise fantastic. And these don't seem to affect her, unless she were to get hurt (which could definitely happen), so it's not like there's need for end of life planning or something, I don't think.",2,1744297381.0,AskVet,2,1.0,False

I'm old enough to drink, I don't have access to large amounts of alcohol just brandy cherries.

Usually I just workout or go walk for a bit. I'm like fidgety af and my brains being real irritable again and its just like im mentally spreading like a neuron everywhere and my brains in and out of myself but in 3d.

1jvzyoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1jvzyoe/582_experience_so_far_and_extraction_question/,58+2 Experience So Far and Extraction Question,"Hi All!

I just upgraded my setup from a Flair Pro 2 (which I've loved) to the 58+2. I'm planning to do popups with it this summer. Hoping for advice here on extraction time and grind settings. Also wanted to share some of my experience so far with the 58+2 in case it's useful for folks thinking about buying one.

**Experience So Far**

Overall the 58+ genuinely feels like an upgrade over the Pro 2. Back-to-back shots are actually possible now without having to reheat my brew cylinder on the bottom of my Moka pot. I switched to the 58 specifically to improve workflow and so far I think it's going to fulfill that purpose really well. It takes about the same amount of time to heat 200ml of milk (I use a Subminimal pitcher for now, have a Morning Dream on pre-order) as it does to prep and pull a shot.

The hard case might as well be made out of kryptonite, which will be very useful when I'm taking it to market and such. You could store nuclear codes in that thing. Assembly and disassembly for transport is gonna be a bit of a PITA but it beats transporting it fully assembled and risking damage. 

One day in, there are a couple of things I prefer about the Pro 2, at least for now. When brewing, I like to get the lever under my shoulder for leverage and I miss the beefier handle on the Pro 2 for that purpose. Maybe I'll get used to it as the Pro 2 was also an adjustment. Also the 58+ slides around a lot so I have to hold it with one hand while pushing down with the other. Some better nubbies on the bottom would have been nice. Probably an easy fix though with a silicon mat or something. I do not like the palm tamper it comes with -- there's nothing wrong with it but I have wrist issues and I find that a more ""traditional"" tamper like the one the Pro 2 comes with works better for me.

I'm pretty sure the puck screen is more cosmetic than functional. It's much more porous than the one on the Pro 2 and I'm not sure I see a difference in pressure between when it's on and when it isn't. Maybe this is normal, but the Pro 2 puck screen made a big difference in pressure so I expected that to be the case with the 58+2. I've also had grounds get stuck in it, which was far less common with the Pro 2, and I really don't want to have to scrub it with a toothbrush in the middle of a market to avoid channeling.

**Issue/Question: Underextraction**

My shots are pulling way too fast even after I grind way, way finer. I'm using a DF54. Previously I would grind a dose of regular between, say, 13 and 15, and so far I've gone down as far as 7 (for reference, the DF54 dial goes from 0 to 90), and down under 5 on my wife's decaf. I have to pre-infuse below one bar of pressure, and the whole shot pulls in seconds. I'm pulling shots of 48g or higher as opposed to my usual 36 just so the shots aren't pure acid. I am double, even triple tamping with the Flair palm tamper. 

Shockingly, even underextracted, cup quality from the 58+2 is immediately superior to the Pro 2. I'm getting more clarity, more flavor and less harshness. Both as a straight shot and as a flat white, this thing is immediately making delicious coffee out of my home-roasted Rwandan natural.

Which makes me wonder -- am I actually underextracting or are shots on the 58+ just much faster? What extraction times do you find make a balanced cup? Is pre-infusing impacting the pull time or should I just keep grinding finer? 

I'll keep playing with the settings and report back, but would love to know what others have experienced with the 58's.

Also what scale do you like using for your extractions? The one I have now doesn't quite fit in the drip tray.",2,1744297072.0,FlairEspresso,2,0.75,False

We sat together sometimes before to talk about work and other shit over coffee break. So we both filled our cups with coffee and then she headed towards the seating area while I returned back to enter the bay as I had to take a meet. 

I received a phone call after I came inside so I went outside again and as I was exiting the bay (it has a single entry and exit door), she was on the other side entering so I gave her a way but she stormed in furiously and never looked at me.

I pinged her after a while if she's ok or not? She replied she's just feeling sleepy and nothing else.

Speaking from experience, starting out in this world can come with a steep learning curve. I’ve seen countless sugar babies (SBs) share stories or ask questions that reveal serious, often dangerous, oversights. Inspired by a post from another SB, I decided to put together some advice and red flags to help you navigate this lifestyle more safely and confidently.

#  SCAM AWARENESS

New scams pop up constantly, and recognizing the signs early is critical. If you’re ever unsure about a situation, it’s usually a scam. Trust your gut.

* **“Too good to be true” = Scam.**
* **If you** ***think*** **it might be a scam, it probably is.**

**Big red flags include:**

* Offering to send large sums of money before meeting.
* Asking for iTunes, Visa gift cards, or any kind of ""reimbursement"" via unusual payment methods.
* Sending a check and asking you to return part of the funds.
* Requesting your bank, PayPal, Venmo, or CashApp login credentials.
* Promising allowance ""after a week/month""—never agree to this.
* Asking you to invest in something or “flip” money.

**Pro tip:** In the beginning, *cash is king.* Digital transfers can be reversed. Stick to cash until trust is built.

# BEFORE YOU START

Even if you're already sugaring, it’s never too late to improve your safety protocols.

**1. Use a burner number.**  
Google Voice is a great option. Your real number can reveal a lot about you with just a quick search.

**2. Create a sugar persona.**  
Set up a separate email, consider using a fake name for initial dates, and avoid sharing identifying details (like school, neighborhood, or hometown) too soon.

**3. Use unique photos.**  
Make sure your sugar profile photos can’t be reverse image searched. Run your own images through a reverse search to double-check.

**4. Vet thoroughly.**  
Do your homework. Cross-reference any information they give you—job titles, companies, universities, etc. Tools like Mr. Number and Spokeo can be helpful. Reverse search their profile pics, email, name, and phone number.

Keep in mind: discretion doesn’t always equal deception. Some POTs are simply married or private, but always gather what you can. Knowledge is power.

#  RED FLAGS BEFORE MEETING

* **Asks for nudes/suggestive pics.** Your profile should be enough. If they push for more, they’re likely collecting.
* **Keeps steering the convo to sex.** It's tacky and tells you where their priorities lie. Shut it down. One warning max.
* **Raunchy usernames.** “KittyLicker420” isn’t looking for a real arrangement.
* **Bad grammar.** If they claim to be a successful professional but can’t spell? Pass.
* **Boundary pushers.** Anyone pressuring you to drop boundaries early (e.g., skip using a burner, disclose private info, go condomless, or meet the same day you connect) is a no.
* **Insists on meeting late at night.** Avoid “drinks at a hotel bar” meetups. Stick to coffee, lunch, or early dinner in a public setting.

# 👀 DURING THE MEET & GREET

**First meets should always:**

* Be in public places with people around.
* Be accessible via your own transportation. **NEVER let him pick you up or drive you home.**

**Share your plans.**  
Let someone know where you're going and when you'll be back. Give your friend his name, car make/model, or even a license plate if you end up riding together later.

**Don’t get drunk.**  
A drink or two is fine if you’re comfortable, but never let your guard down.

**Compensation:**  
Meet and greets are usually *uncompensated*, but asking for travel reimbursement is reasonable. While I never ask, it’s a great sign if a POT chooses to gift you at the end.

**Pay attention to:**

* His appearance (clean, well-groomed, quality shoes/watch).
* His behavior toward staff (respectful? Known by name? Tips well?).
* The type of credit card he uses—little clues can speak volumes.

#  MEET & GREET RED FLAGS

* **Tries to isolate you.** Never agree to move to a second, private location. Drill it in: *No intimacy at the meet and greet. Ever.*
* **Nickel-and-diming.** If he cringes at the bill or limits your order, he’s cheap—or can’t afford the lifestyle.
* **Inconsistent stories.** Discretion is one thing. Sloppy lies are another.
* **Pushy behavior.** Anyone trying to control the situation early on will only get worse with time.

#  STARTING THE ARRANGEMENT

If you move forward, **the first intimate meet should be in a nice hotel**, not his home. Hotels are neutral ground with staff and security around. Bonus: room service, spa access, and a comfy bed.

**Non-negotiable:**  
**You should always receive your allowance** ***before*** **any intimacy**—especially early on. Whether it’s slipped in your bag, in a greeting card, or handed discreetly, you need to feel secure before things get physical.

Don’t feel awkward asking:

* “Do you have something for me?”
* “Let’s handle the allowance so we can relax and enjoy ourselves.”

#  ONGOING RED FLAGS

* **Missed/late allowance.** “No I forgots.” No “I’ll pay you after.” Whether you’re PPM or monthly, your arrangement needs to be respected.
* **Pushes past your boundaries.** Whether it’s going raw, requesting kinks you’re uncomfortable with, or ignoring hard limits—this is a major sign of disrespect.

# Final Thoughts

Above all else: **your well-being comes first.**

These bellows signal the end of range days and wading through rocky river banks to harass spawning walleye- turkey season is on the horizon. And I can't wait.

But matching wits with a rope dragging tom demands more than subpar calling and patience—it requires the right shotgun. More over, *a shotgun.*

I'm not on the payroll of any magazine and don't get marketing checks from any firearms manufacturers (although I'm not above taking a bribe if this somehow lands on Benelli's radar). But I do have an unlimited data plan and access to the world wide web, in addition to 20 years of sharing juxtaposed ruined days with the eastern wild turkey. Over that time, I've bought more shotguns than the wife is allowed to know about, and hunted with guys who shoot anything from hand me down single shots to top of the line auto loaders from Italy's finest firearms factories.

I need to stress this now, and once - Turkeys are not inherently hard to kill. A *few* pellets in the right place will drop them dead in their tracks. It really only takes one pellet clipping their spine or destroying their skull to do the job. The tricky part is getting them close enough to take aim and make a good shot.

So I digress, with countless models and configurations on the market, from hefty 12 gauges to featherlight .410 bores, choosing the ideal firearm for turkey hunting can feel overwhelming. 

In this guide, I'm going to break down what truly matters in a turkey shotgun—what features are essential, what’s just nice to have, and how to pick the perfect tool for your style, terrain, and experience level.

#Overview of Gauges for Turkey Hunting

**12 Gauge**

Pros: Largest shot payload

Cons: Heavier recoil and heavier gun.

Best for: Hunters who want maximum punch, especially with TSS (Tungsten Super Shot).

**20 Gauge**

Pros: Lighter weight, reduced recoil, still very effective especially with TSS.

Cons: Slightly less shot volume compared to 12 gauge.

Best for: Youth, women, or anyone wanting a more maneuverable gun in tight terrain.

**.410 Bore**

Pros: Minimal recoil, extremely light and compact.

Cons: Historically underpowered for turkeys, but now effective with TSS.

Best for: Experienced hunters using TSS loads, or youth hunters with limited recoil tolerance.

*Notice that nowhere in there I mentioned one is more powerful than the other. Basically all shotguns fire their pellets between 1000-1500fps. Longbeard XR for instance comes in a wide variety of loadings, but #4 3-1/2"" shells average 1050fps and #4 3"" shells come out at 1200fps. Size doesn't necessarily matter, what matters is payload on target.*

#So if the size of the gun doesn't matter, what’s Necessary for a Turkey Hunting Shotgun?

Simply, precision. This is rarely something people associate with a scattergun, but is what you need to achieve if you want to kill a bird. When using a shotgun for turkey hunting you aim it, whereas you normally point when wing shooting.

**Choke**

Must-Have: Full or Extra-Full (Turkey Choke) — tight constriction increases effective range and pattern density.

Nice-to-Have: Aftermarket turkey-specific choke tubes designed for TSS or your specific lead shell.

**Sights**

Must-Have: Bead sight at minimum. 

Better: Fiber optic sights, adjustable iron sights, or red dot optics for precision aiming. Scopes with crosshairs are also an option, I'm interested to see have low magnification lpvo scopes make their way into the market in the next few years.

**Barrel Length**

Common: 21"" to 24"".

Must-Have: A shorter barrel (20""-24"") is ideal for maneuverability in woods/blinds.

Not Necessary: Long barrels (26”+) offer no real advantage for turkey. They still work, but can be an incumbrance. 

**Ammo**

Must-Have: Accurate & dependable loads — either lead, copper-plated lead, usually between #4-#6

*If you're using an old gun, don't risk damaging it with a high pressure load*

Nice to Have: TSS (Tungsten Super Shot): Denser than lead, allows smaller shot sizes (like #9 or #7) to kill cleanly at longer ranges. *Especially critical for .410 and nice for a 20 gauge.*

*Avoid using Bismuth shot if you are in a lead-free zone. It is brittle and will not break bones (neck/skull)*

**Camouflage**

Must-Have: Shotgun should be non-reflective: camo or matte finish is ideal. Your highly polished gun will absolutely work, but it makes it going unnoticed difficult.

Not Necessary: Fancy camo pattern - just avoid shine or bright colors.

**Optional But Useful Features**

Sling studs and a sling for carrying long distances.

Pistol grip or thumbhole stocks for improved stability.

Recoil pad for comfort, especially on a 12 gauge.

Picatinny rail for optics.

-------------------------------------

#So shut up already, what gun should I buy?

You shut up and buy whatever you want. But really, it all comes down to whatever you want your gun for. 

If you want a shotgun specifically for turkey hunting then it wouldn't hurt to spend a few extra dollars on a ""turkey edition"" that comes pre-dipped in a camo pattern, drilled and tapped for an optic, and with a factory extra full choke.

If you want something that's more of a ""do-it-all"" gun then find something matte and offering threads for screwing in aftermarket chokes. 

*The only caveat I will throw out now is please understand that there is a gigantic jump in quality and reliability between a $500 and $800 semi automatic shotgun. Turkish guns (those made in the country of Turkey), are notorious for their inconsistencies with poor fits and finishes and their unreliability. There are some diamonds that make it down the assembly lines, but that's the exception rather than the rule.*

Here's some suggestions though, for just about any price range.


**$200–$500**

1. Mossberg 500 Turkey
Gauge Options: 12 and 20 gauge

Features:

Adjustable fiber optic sights, 24-inch barrel, Mossy Oak Obsession camo finish, comes with an extra-full choke tube

Price: Approximately $500
*Please don't confuse this with the maverick 88 made by Mossberg International*

2. Stevens 301 Turkey
Gauge Options: .410 bore

Features:

26-inch barrel, extended extra-full choke, single-shot design, available in camo patterns, ideal for hunters seeking a lightweight, affordable option, especially effective when paired with TSS loads. 

Price: Approximately $250

3. Benelli Nova - 20 Gauge
I'm not going to rant on forever about this gun. I love mine and shoot it with Federal TSS through a Carlson's TSS specific choke. ~$400

**$501–$999**

1. Winchester SX4 NWTF Cantilever Turkey
Gauge Options: 12 and 20 gauge

Features:

24-inch barrel, cantilever rail for optics, Mossy Oak Obsession camo, Invector-Plus extra-full turkey choke. A reliable semi-automatic with features tailored specifically for turkey hunting


Price: Around $800


2. Stoeger M3500
Gauge Options: 12 gauge

Features: Semi-automatic with Inertia-Driven system, 24-inch barrel, comes with a variety of chokes, including extra-full turkey choke and available in camo finishes

Price: Approximately $850


**$1,000–$3,000**

1. Benelli M2 Turkey Performance Shop
Gauge Options: 20 gauge

Features: 24-inch barrel, custom-tuned by Benelli’s Performance Shop, comes with a Burris FastFire II red dot sight and Rob Roberts T3 choke tube

Price: Approximately $2,999

2. Franchi Affinity 3 Turkey Elite
Gauge Options: 12 and 20 gauge

Features: 24-inch barrel, Fiber optic front sight and receiver-mounted rail for optics, Extended extra-full turkey choke, Cerakote finish on the receiver and barrel

Price: Around $1,200

**Additional Considerations:**

Gauge Selection: While 12 gauge offers more payload, 20 gauge and .410 bore have gained popularity, especially with advancements in ammunition like TSS.

Choke Tubes: An extra-full choke is essential for dense patterns at longer ranges.

Optics: Many modern turkey shotguns come with rails or are pre-drilled for optics, enhancing aiming precision.

Camouflage: A camo finish helps the shotgun blend into the hunting environment, reducing visibility to turkeys. White not necessary, take every advantage you can.

-------------------------------------

When it comes to turkey hunting, the right shotgun isn’t just about brand names or big price tags—it’s about fit, function, and the confidence you have behind the trigger. 

Whether you're toting a tried-and-true 12 gauge, a nimble 20, or a modern .410 loaded with TSS, your success hinges on a tight pattern, a precise aim, and getting setup to make the right shot. 

With the right choke, reliable ammo, and a shotgun that feels like an extension of your body, you'll be well-equipped for those heart-pounding moments when a longbeard struts into range.

1jvzlr4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jvzlr4,Outdoor lift top coffee-to-dining table,"I just finished this, and I wanted to share! There's not really anything off-the-shelf that's available for this kind of thing, so I created/planned this out myself. We needed a long table for a deck and wanted something that was coffee table height for when you're just chilling, but with the ability to lift up for dinner height when we want to eat out on the deck.

Spent about 3-1/2 months working on this. Used red batu/red balau (not sure what the official name is) that we got from our local woodshop - super dense and heavy wood, they said it's similar to mahogany but cheaper. There was a definite need to get quality table saw rip blades and pre-drill everything.

The coffee table dimensions are about 27"" wide x 105"" long x 20"" high. Both sides lift up (each top weighs about 55 lbs and it's relatively easy to lift with the lift-top mechanisms in place; I was considering gas strut supports at one point, but ended up not needing it), and there are swing arms built into each table top that slot into place into the other table top. The three leaves are stored inside the table, and they are supported on the swing arms ([here's a video of the swing arms turning](https://imgur.com/a/e8YRPbe)). The dining table is about 50"" wide x 105"" long x 30"" high.

Overall, the table is really sturdy (heavy as hell!), and I'm really happy with it. I may make some adjustments here and there (adding hand slots to make things easier to lift, making the bottom storage flat so the leaves slide as you put them away, and maybe covering the mechanisms), but we want to use it for a bit to see what needs to be done.

**Tree Trunk & Branches:** Start by making the trunk out of brown construction paper, twisted paper, pipe cleaners, or modeling wire. Be as stylized or as real as you'd like. Let the branches branch out in some kind of wild, free-flowing shape.

**Blossoms:** Pink and white tissue paper in little squares or circles (or crepe paper or coffee filters) can be gently crushed in the center for blooming effect. Use glue or sticking tape to fix them in place within the branch. Add an extra realism effect by blending different shades of pink.

\- Optional details include painting the tree trunk using light gray and brown paints, or using an overlay of light white paint for a light, airy look. A dab of glue-on glitter can be used to add a decorative, magical look to flowers, depending on preference.

**Base & Display:** Stand your tree in an urn using pebbles, foam block, or even an ornately decorated cardboard stand. Alternatively, create its flat version using paint for its trunk and 3D flowers.

Not Even the Guy Who Made the Coffee: Black Bag,"I’ve been waiting a long time for Fassbender’s return to Hollywood. After a streak of box office flops and a small controversy, I was starting to think he might quietly fade from the scene. But with some time off and the right directors in his corner, he’s officially back. Strangely, his role in The Killer feels almost like a copy of Woodhouse in Black Bag and that’s not a bad thing. Cold, calculated, emotionally locked-in? Fassbender nails it. His face sells the façade of a man who's blank on the surface but storming underneath.

Teamed up with Blanchett, we’re dropped into a sharp, icy spy drama. In this world of British intelligence, secrets are just truths waiting to explode, and dinner parties are mandatory messy social nightmares.

Woodhouse is always three steps ahead, while his intel team starts sweating bullets when they discover a leak. In their line of work, one mistake could cost hundreds, maybe thousands of lives. So it's safe to say the stakes are high, and even the smallest slip could mean prison.

Good spy thrillers embrace the mess, and Black Bag leans into the dirt. Torture tables, double-crosses, and the haunting sense that everyone has something to hide. When Woodhouse’s wife becomes a suspect, the whole thing flips into a classic whodunit, and a pretty fun one at that.

1jvzggt,https://i.redd.it/dfdw7kzpq0ue1.png,a bad a17 player's boss relic ranking. roast my placements in the comments,"(i am aware that, no matter how bad a relic/card is in this game, there is always at least some kind of scenario where using a ""bad"" item is the correct choice. this list is based on how much i enjoy a relic, as well as how strong i feel like it is in general)

my reasoning for these placements:

coffee dripper: one of the best energy relics in the game. you want to be minimizing how much you can rest in general, and there are plenty of other ways to heal, like burning blood, bites, self repair, etc

cursed key: i like taking this, especially if i took blue key before seeing it. an extra energy, in exchange for losing 2 or 3 relics is worth it imo. sometimes i'll take a peek in the chest anyways if there's a shop coming up, or if i have ways to handle the curse (i like to think of it like the mausoleum event where you get a relic but a guaranteed curse at high ascension)

philo stone: this seems to be a pretty unpopular relic but i don't mind it. admittedly it does make the heart harder but i feel like +1 strength isn't super significant for most enemies, excluding byrds obviously

pbox: i like gambling, next

black star: it's not a very good boss relic, and going into act 2 with this will almost certainly get you killed. but when it works it's satisfying as hell

bing bong: i honestly don't know if this is considered a good relic or not, but i like it. it's fun to see what's inside

runic pyramid: it's just a really good relic. being able to save key cards for a perfect moment is incredibly powerful and it's fun to build around

ring of the serpent: the only reason this is up here is because i play on mobile where this is bugged and gives +2 draw every turn

fusion hammer: i think this is fine. works better if you have a shovel or something to have extra actions at fires. the downside is also mitigated significantly with stuff like apotheosis, egg relics, lesson learned, warped tongs, etc

holy water: 3 bonus energy that can be used at any time is pretty useful, not much else to say

inserter: having a huge amount of orbs is fun

nuclear battery: free plasma orb is nice. basically an energy relic with little downside. boss swapping into this kinda sucks though, since you can't dualcast a lightning immediately

sacred bark: fun with alchemize/white beast. it doesn't buff every potion and some of its buffs are not super important, but there are some cool things you can do with it, like regen potion healing for 55, or flex/speed potion giving +10 stats with an artifact charge

snecko eye: building around this feels great. you can ignore energy costs altogether and draft high cost, high impact cards, and the +2 draw is a good bonus too. it also lets me blame losing on bad rng

wrist blade: maybe not the best relic, but i love using shivs so i probably take this more than i should. it also has neat synergy with bullet time

hovering kite: discard is pretty easy to get so this is a free energy for me most of the time. even better if tools of the trade is active

slaver's collar: its ok ig but i prefer having something else. there are plenty of dangerous hallway fights, especially in act 2

frozen core: it's decent. defect's starter falls off pretty hard after act 1 so i don't mind swapping it out.

astrolabe: most cards are better than strikes/defends, and you can get some decent stuff out of this. i prefer pandora's box though

violet lotus: it sounds good on paper but i'm not sure how much the 3rd energy actually helps. 2 energy from exiting calm is already a lot so idrk when this is a good pick if at all

empty cage: removing basics is nice but this also feels kinda low impact for a boss relic. i don't enjoy taking it

black blood: for a boss relic it's not good. ironclad's starter is fine and is sufficient to regenerate from using stuff like offering, an extra 6 healing per fight isn't really helpful

runic dome: two problems with this relic, one, its not fun to use at all. two, people like to say this is good because you can just memorize every enemy's moveset but that's nonsense. it is true that there are some enemies with fixed attack patterns but there are plenty of dangerous fights that are made significantly worse without knowing intents (gremlin leader, nemesis, time eater, writhing mass, etc). so i really try avoid picking this if i can help it. that said it is still an energy relic and sometimes you might just have to suck it up if you want a chance at winning.

ectoplasm: one of the most hated boss relics. losing the ability to gain gold isn't fun, sure. like runic dome though it's still an energy relic and personally i don't mind losing gold gain as much

velvet choker: i don't pick this much, but i can see it being good on clad who has lots of high cost cards and is very energy hungry. obviously this breaks shiv decks which as mentioned i enjoy so i'm a little biased. if you know you're not playing lots of cards per turn though, this is probably fine

sozu: ectoplasm's cousin when it comes to unpopular energy relics. potions are very strong, but so is energy. it's sad to take this and see ornithopter/white beast later in the run. it's also sad to take this if you have alchemize, but honestly a 0 cost card that exhausts is better than a poopy strike lol

mark of pain: i used to think this was good as a new player with fire breathing. the problem is that the wounds chunk your draw (and fire breathing isnt even a very good card). so yeah, i don't really pick this nowadays

tiny house: yeah we all know it sucks, nothing new

busted crown: this is, in my opinion, the absolute worst boss relic in the game. at least when it comes to picking one end of act 1. the other energy relics give you energy and a downside that, while may be annoying to play around, is still something you can deal with. busted crown on the other hand completely kills your ability to build a deck... which is pretty important in a deck building game. you can prioritize going to shops for cards but that can only get you so far. it also makes rare cards more rare due to how card rewards work. this is the one boss relic in the game that i legitimately do not see a use case for, end of act 1. ectoplasm? sucks to play with, but better than skip. sozu? it hurts to lose potions, but you can play around it. choker? it might break some decks, sure, but otherwise it's fine. dome? it's frustrating to play with, but you can just bite the bullet. i can't see any redeeming quality about busted crown. people like to say that prayer wheel/question card makes this less bad of a pick... i disagree. it's the other way around, prayer wheel is an incredibly powerful relic especially if gotten at the start of the game. having prayer wheel should give you more reason to not pick crown, not less. now if we're talking about end of act 2, busted crown is less bad. you have a more structured deck than  end of act 1, so this might be the correct pick. but at the same time, you could very possibly be missing key pieces to your deck that will really help it take off into the endgame. when that's the case, crown is still a no go.",7,1744295771.0,slaythespire,11,0.82,False

“Hi ____! Its ______. I was thinking about your offer to do that overnight shift to learn everything, im honestly not sure how ill be able to obtain much information during those hour. The latest i go to sleep is 11pm so i feel like my ability to stay up and learn and perform will be a terrible first impression. I never ever stay up late, i definitely said yes on the spot immediately to that because it was my first opportunity to work with you guys that i was offered. If theres anyway i can do the same thing but for a super early shift that would work a lot better for me, thank you, let me know! :)”

And she said

“I understand. Unfortunately early morning shifts are very hectic. I really just wanted you to have some one on one time with ______ without the distractions of the store being open to learn things. The overnight is really just to organize things in the backroom and on the sales floor. “

What do i respond because i dont want to come off as a push over where now they throw crazy shifts at me and it looks like ill do whatever they say for the future. I dont want to do this shift bc i literally dont think ill be able to.

Edit: i responded with 
“Okay got it, lots of coffee for me it is then hahaha! 😆 Thank you again for this job opportunity, cant wait to officially start!”

And she said
“And this isn’t a thing we do often. We only have it happening because of some IT stuff that they have to do overnight.”

And i said

“I gotcha, no problem! 
As long as i dont have overnights on my official schedule im completely okay with doing that shift, ill survive one all nighter hahaha.”

And she said

“Omg nooooo. I would hate if we had them all the time! My last one was February of last year.”

And i said
“Oooooh!!! okay amazing thats fine, thank you so much for clarifying everything :D”

So to sum it up thank you guys for commenting because i felt stuck, i am an esthetician but had some issues with my old job so i quit and am trying to find a shitty retail job for now and am really not too sure how it all works since the beauty industry is much different with scheduling.

Mmm, may I take your jacket baby?

I know *that* room is intriguing…

But did you see the pool?! 

Kisses and extra snuggles this morning.

A little bird told me that you had some bad dreams last night. Will you let me hold you a little closer this morning? Run my fingers through your hair? 

Wake up slow, sipping coffee side by side..
But maybe still in bed today…

Grinning big today,

1jvzd8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1jvzd8h/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least… I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children’s parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as “SpookySplorers98”.

According to the boys’ parents and my personal watching of the channel’s content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as “analog horror”. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most “authentic feel”.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin’s uncle’s property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and “scary” things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran’s parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented “haunted” location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn’t stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys’ camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file’s number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape’s transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

(Footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York’s face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.)

Cecil: “Ah! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight’s bright!”

Austin (laughing): “What? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.”

(Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.)

Austin: “So I’m thinking we’ll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.”

Kamran: “That’s when I’ll come in?”

(Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.)

Austin: “Exactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don’t want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.”

(Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.)

Austin: “Alright, here we go.”

(The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads “Medical Center”.)

Austin: “So we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we’ll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We’ll catch back up with y’all once we’re inside.”

(Austin stops walking.)

Austin: “Ok, that should be good. Let’s find a way into the…”

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.)

Cecil: “Woah! This is so cool!”

(The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.)

Austin: “Ok, once I hop through, we’ll walk down the hall. Then we’ll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.”

Cecil: “Gotcha.”

(Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.)

Austin: “Alright. We’ve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let’s look around and see what we can find… Ok. That’s good.”

(Camera cuts to the next scene.)

**Report Note**: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.)

Cecil: “Gotta watch our step out here.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m.  Austin’s voice can be heard behind the camera.)

Austin: “God, this place is freaky.”

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

(Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked.)

**Report** **Note**: Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the symbol was here before the boys arrived at the location or if the boys made this symbol themselves for the video.

Austin: “That’s so cool… No, I don’t like that let me try-”

(Camera cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.)

Austin: “Woah… Nice find.”

Cecil: “What do you think it’s doing here?”

Austin: “Probably people trying to summon ghosts or something.”

Cecil: “I don’t like this.”

(A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.)

Cecil: “What the hell was that?”

Austin: “I don’t know. Let’s go check it out.”

(The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.)

Austin: “Perfect! Good job, Kamran. Let’s look for a nice open spot for the next shot.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.)

Austin (whispering): “I didn’t hear anything.”

Cecil (whispering): “How? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.”

Kamran (whispering): “Is there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.”

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don’t want us in here when it does. But that’s not gonna happen for like a hundred years.”

Cecil (whispering): “Stick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.”

(Camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.)

**Report** **Note**: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys’ footsteps on broken glass can be heard.)

Kamran (whispering): “I think we should go.”

Austin: “You were the one that suggested this place. There’s no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.”

Kamran (whispering): “But what about the noises?”

Austin: “You saw the video. There was nothing there. This building’s old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.”

Kamran (whispering): “The camera didn’t show anything 'cause it’s dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn’t have seen it.”

Austin: “So what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We’re here now already dude. I’m not going till we finish the video.”

Cecil (whispering): “Ok, look. I say we stay and film, but let’s work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.”

Austin: “Sure, yeah. That’ll be fine.”

(The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.)

Kamran (whispering and sounding nervous): “Yeah, ok. Let’s just make it quick.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.)

Cecil: “Are you sure it’s this way?”

Austin: “I’m telling you, right down here.”

(A crash can be heard further down the hallway.)

Austin: “That room! Go!”

(The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.)

Cecil: “Why’s the ghost toying with us like this?”

(Brief pause.)

Austin: “Cool. So, we’ll-”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.)

Austin: “Ok so I think this’ll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything’s in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we’ll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.”

**Report** **Note**: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): “Do I have to go in there? Can’t I just throw something into the room?”

Austin: “People will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can’t see.”

Kamran: “I really want to get out of here, Austin.”

Austin: “Ok! Then go in the room and make some noise.”

Cecil: “Austin, chill. It’s ok.”

Austin: “No! It’s the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don’t understand the big deal. Like I’ll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.”

Kamran: “Ok, fine. You have like one take though, ok?”

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): “Thank you! It’s gonna be great!”

(Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.)

Austin: “Ok. Here we go… Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.”

Cecil: “I agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we’ll be able to hear all the strange noises.”

Austin: “I’m sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.”

Cecil: “Maybe that’s why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.”

Austin (looking agitated): “Exactly. And to add to that… what if… Ok Kamran! You’re supposed to be making noise by now! Don’t give us two long to talk.”

(The two boys stare at the door in silence.)

Austin: “Look, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.”

(The two boys sit in silence again.)

Cecil: “Kamran, you aren’t scaring us.”

(Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.)

Austin: “Seriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-”

(The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man’s head is craned over the boy’s neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.)

Austin (whispering): “Holy shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.”

(The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran’s neck. The man’s arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man’s abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.)

**Report** **Note**: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): “Run, Austin! Run!”

(The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.)

Cecil: “Come on! Come on! We got to get out of-”

(As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil’s left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.)

**Report** **Note**: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

**Report** **Note**: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6’2”. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man’s arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

(Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man’s head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil’s neck hard enough to cause Cecil’s neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man’s mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.)

(After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.)

Austin (crying): “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry sir… I’ll leave… Please… I’ll leave, and I won’t tell anyone. I swear… Please God…”

(The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin’s screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.)

(The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.)

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

“We need to contact the FBI,” I said. “Clearly, we’re dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there’s the trick with him getting in that room. I don’t have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth… what the hell was that?”

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

“I need you to remain here, detective. I’m going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I’ll tell you where we go from here.”

“Yes, sir.” I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

“How many people have seen this video?” he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

“So far? Just us, sir.”

“Ok.” He said sternly. “Listen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?”

“Yes, sir.” I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children’s families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in “SpookySplorers98 YouTube” and pressed enter… No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys’ names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing… Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter… “0 Results Found”. With the exception of the parents’ emails, it was as though the boys’ case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant’s office. Something was happening with the boys’ case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

“Detective Bowman,” he said calmly, “what can I do for you?”

“Sir,” I replied, “I need to talk to you about the missing children’s case from a few weeks ago.”

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

“Sir,” I continued, “all mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It’s like the case didn’t ever exist.”

“You were told not to talk about this matter.” he said firmly.

“And I haven’t. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That’s an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.”

“You won’t get that reassurance from me, detective.” He spoke quietly but sharply. “All I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‘delicate’ and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn’t exist.”

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

“I’ve already asked them, Bowman.” he whispered. “I asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.”

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

“I’m sorry, Bowman. I really am… I know this is bothering you. God knows it’s bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.”

“Yes, sir.” I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

“Detective,” my lieutenant spoke, “you did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.”

“Yes, sir.” I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape’s transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don’t know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don’t know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn’t said to me.",5,1744295544.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

“Hi ____! Its ______. I was thinking about your offer to do that overnight shift to learn everything, im honestly not sure how ill be able to obtain much information during those hour. The latest i go to sleep is 11pm so i feel like my ability to stay up and learn and perform will be a terrible first impression. I never ever stay up late, i definitely said yes on the spot immediately to that because it was my first opportunity to work with you guys that i was offered. If theres anyway i can do the same thing but for a super early shift that would work a lot better for me, thank you, let me know! :)”

And she said

“I understand. Unfortunately early morning shifts are very hectic. I really just wanted you to have some one on one time with ______ without the distractions of the store being open to learn things. The overnight is really just to organize things in the backroom and on the sales floor. “

What do i respond because i dont want to come off as a push over where now they throw crazy shifts at me and it looks like ill do whatever they say for the future. I dont want to do this shift bc i literally dont think ill be able to.

EDIT: i responded with 
“Okay got it, lots of coffee for me it is then hahaha! 😆 Thank you again for this job opportunity, cant wait to officially start!”

And she said
“And this isn’t a thing we do often. We only have it happening because of some IT stuff that they have to do overnight.”

And i said

“I gotcha, no problem! 
As long as i dont have overnights on my official schedule im completely okay with doing that shift, ill survive one all nighter hahaha.”

And she said

“Omg nooooo. I would hate if we had them all the time! My last one was February of last year.”

And i said
“Oooooh!!! okay amazing thats fine, thank you so much for clarifying everything :D”

So to sum it up thank you guys for commenting because i felt stuck, i am an esthetician but had some issues with my old job so i quit and am trying to find a shitty retail job for now and am really not too sure how it all works since the beauty industry is much different with scheduling.

1jvzd1z,https://i.redd.it/ycryoohrn0ue1.png,Bluetooth scale for Flair 58,"Hi guys ! 

  
I am purchasing a flair 58 after learning on a bambino and doing V60 as ma primary source of coffee. 

I already have a dealer scale, but I am looking to get a BT pressure sensor and scale to monitor in an app. 

  
Among the scales supported by bean conqueror, which would you recommend ?  Here are the things I care about 

* Reasonable price, not expecting 20€ scale, but I am not blowing 100+€ in it. 
* Availlable in EU
* Reliable ! 
* No fuss to use, either via bluetooth or as a ""dumb scale""
* fits in the f58
* easy to wash
* I don't care about batteries vs charging
* I don't feel the need for auto timer 

Decent scale 1.2 at 87€ (with shipping) seems good, close rival to the Scale 2, though scale 2 seems to necessitate a PayPal account.

Bookoo scale, especially when bundled with the pressure sensor is really cheap, but I am concerned about reliability

There seem to be multiple cheaper options (aliexpress, eureka,)

  
Open to any suggestion :)",2,1744295531.0,FlairEspresso,4,1.0,False
1jvzc3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jvzc3x/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least… I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children’s parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as “SpookySplorers98”.

According to the boys’ parents and my personal watching of the channel’s content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as “analog horror”. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most “authentic feel”.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin’s uncle’s property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and “scary” things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran’s parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented “haunted” location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn’t stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys’ camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file’s number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape’s transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

(Footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York’s face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.)

Cecil: “Ah! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight’s bright!”

Austin (laughing): “What? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.”

(Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.)

Austin: “So I’m thinking we’ll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.”

Kamran: “That’s when I’ll come in?”

(Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.)

Austin: “Exactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don’t want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.”

(Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.)

Austin: “Alright, here we go.”

(The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads “Medical Center”.)

Austin: “So we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we’ll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We’ll catch back up with y’all once we’re inside.”

(Austin stops walking.)

Austin: “Ok, that should be good. Let’s find a way into the…”

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.)

Cecil: “Woah! This is so cool!”

(The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.)

Austin: “Ok, once I hop through, we’ll walk down the hall. Then we’ll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.”

Cecil: “Gotcha.”

(Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.)

Austin: “Alright. We’ve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let’s look around and see what we can find… Ok. That’s good.”

(Camera cuts to the next scene.)

**Report Note**: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.)

Cecil: “Gotta watch our step out here.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m.  Austin’s voice can be heard behind the camera.)

Austin: “God, this place is freaky.”

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

(Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked.)

**Report** **Note**: Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the symbol was here before the boys arrived at the location or if the boys made this symbol themselves for the video.

Austin: “That’s so cool… No, I don’t like that let me try-”

(Camera cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.)

Austin: “Woah… Nice find.”

Cecil: “What do you think it’s doing here?”

Austin: “Probably people trying to summon ghosts or something.”

Cecil: “I don’t like this.”

(A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.)

Cecil: “What the hell was that?”

Austin: “I don’t know. Let’s go check it out.”

(The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.)

Austin: “Perfect! Good job, Kamran. Let’s look for a nice open spot for the next shot.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.)

Austin (whispering): “I didn’t hear anything.”

Cecil (whispering): “How? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.”

Kamran (whispering): “Is there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.”

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don’t want us in here when it does. But that’s not gonna happen for like a hundred years.”

Cecil (whispering): “Stick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.”

(Camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.)

**Report** **Note**: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys’ footsteps on broken glass can be heard.)

Kamran (whispering): “I think we should go.”

Austin: “You were the one that suggested this place. There’s no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.”

Kamran (whispering): “But what about the noises?”

Austin: “You saw the video. There was nothing there. This building’s old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.”

Kamran (whispering): “The camera didn’t show anything 'cause it’s dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn’t have seen it.”

Austin: “So what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We’re here now already dude. I’m not going till we finish the video.”

Cecil (whispering): “Ok, look. I say we stay and film, but let’s work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.”

Austin: “Sure, yeah. That’ll be fine.”

(The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.)

Kamran (whispering and sounding nervous): “Yeah, ok. Let’s just make it quick.”

\--------------------------------------------------

(Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.)

Cecil: “Are you sure it’s this way?”

Austin: “I’m telling you, right down here.”

(A crash can be heard further down the hallway.)

Austin: “That room! Go!”

(The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.)

Cecil: “Why’s the ghost toying with us like this?”

(Brief pause.)

Austin: “Cool. So, we’ll-”

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.)

Austin: “Ok so I think this’ll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything’s in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we’ll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.”

**Report** **Note**: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): “Do I have to go in there? Can’t I just throw something into the room?”

Austin: “People will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can’t see.”

Kamran: “I really want to get out of here, Austin.”

Austin: “Ok! Then go in the room and make some noise.”

Cecil: “Austin, chill. It’s ok.”

Austin: “No! It’s the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don’t understand the big deal. Like I’ll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.”

Kamran: “Ok, fine. You have like one take though, ok?”

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): “Thank you! It’s gonna be great!”

(Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.)

\--------------------------------------------------

(The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.)

Austin: “Ok. Here we go… Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.”

Cecil: “I agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we’ll be able to hear all the strange noises.”

Austin: “I’m sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.”

Cecil: “Maybe that’s why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.”

Austin (looking agitated): “Exactly. And to add to that… what if… Ok Kamran! You’re supposed to be making noise by now! Don’t give us two long to talk.”

(The two boys stare at the door in silence.)

Austin: “Look, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.”

(The two boys sit in silence again.)

Cecil: “Kamran, you aren’t scaring us.”

(Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.)

Austin: “Seriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-”

(The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man’s head is craned over the boy’s neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.)

Austin (whispering): “Holy shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.”

(The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran’s neck. The man’s arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man’s abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.)

**Report** **Note**: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): “Run, Austin! Run!”

(The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.)

Cecil: “Come on! Come on! We got to get out of-”

(As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil’s left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.)

**Report** **Note**: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

**Report** **Note**: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6’2”. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man’s arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

(Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man’s head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil’s neck hard enough to cause Cecil’s neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man’s mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.)

(After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.)

Austin (crying): “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry sir… I’ll leave… Please… I’ll leave, and I won’t tell anyone. I swear… Please God…”

(The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin’s screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.)

(The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.)

\--------------------------------------------------

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

“We need to contact the FBI,” I said. “Clearly, we’re dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there’s the trick with him getting in that room. I don’t have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth… what the hell was that?”

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

“I need you to remain here, detective. I’m going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I’ll tell you where we go from here.”

“Yes, sir.” I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

“How many people have seen this video?” he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

“So far? Just us, sir.”

“Ok.” He said sternly. “Listen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?”

“Yes, sir.” I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children’s families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in “SpookySplorers98 YouTube” and pressed enter… No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys’ names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing… Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter… “0 Results Found”. With the exception of the parents’ emails, it was as though the boys’ case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant’s office. Something was happening with the boys’ case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

“Detective Bowman,” he said calmly, “what can I do for you?”

“Sir,” I replied, “I need to talk to you about the missing children’s case from a few weeks ago.”

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

“Sir,” I continued, “all mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It’s like the case didn’t ever exist.”

“You were told not to talk about this matter.” he said firmly.

“And I haven’t. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That’s an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.”

“You won’t get that reassurance from me, detective.” He spoke quietly but sharply. “All I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‘delicate’ and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn’t exist.”

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

“I’ve already asked them, Bowman.” he whispered. “I asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.”

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

“I’m sorry, Bowman. I really am… I know this is bothering you. God knows it’s bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.”

“Yes, sir.” I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

“Detective,” my lieutenant spoke, “you did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.”

“Yes, sir.” I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape’s transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don’t know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don’t know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn’t said to me.",1,1744295466.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1jvza93,https://www.reddit.com/r/realtors/comments/1jvza93/being_a_realtor_with_5_clients_at_all_times/,Being a Realtor with 5+ Clients at all times,"I went through my CRM and pulled some notes from some beginning client conversations. I thought it would be helpful to translate what that looks like when you take on multiple clients at once or working with a Realtor who does. Its worth knowing, I’m not asking for this to be any other way. I love what I do and I do what I love, my clients are like family and Im grateful to serve. 

Being a Realtor isn’t just about showing houses. It’s about syncing your life to everyone else’s…juggling five (or often more) separate schedules, desires, needs, personalities, and time zones (all in the same city). Each client has a rhythm, a routine, and a predictable window when they will call, will text, or suddenly feel ready to “go see a few houses today if possible.”

Here’s a breakdown of what it really looks like from my perspective as a going on 6 year Realtor/Broker/Top Producer.

1. Marcus
	•	Works 8AM–5PM in IT
	•	Lunch break: 11AM–12PM
	•	Wants to tour homes after work at 5:30PM sharp
	•	Calls every day at 11:08AM during lunch to “check the portal” and talk business
	•	Prefers communication via email but sends 3-paragraph texts anyway

2. Kayla
	•	Bartender; works 2PM–10PM
	•	Eats lunch at 7PM
	•	Only available to tour homes between 9AM–12:30PM
	•	Calls at 12:45PM right before she starts getting ready for work. Talk to me until she gets to work and begins talking to an employee and then has to go quickly - every time. 
	•	Thinks next-day notice is “plenty of time” to schedule a showing

3. Denise
	•	Stay-at-home mom of 3
	•	Says her schedule is “super flexible,” but somehow she’s busiest when you are
	•	Wants to tour homes at 10AM or 1PM, depending on nap time
	•	Calls every day at exactly 8:01AM, just as you’re heading out the door. Texts after the kids are in bed and sends you listings shes looking at while eating dried mangos and watching shows. 
	•	Asks deep financing questions before you’ve even made coffee. 

4. Adrian
	•	Works night shifts and usually asleep until early afternoon
	•	Calls like clockwork at 3PM just as you’re finally trying to eat lunch
	•	Wants to see homes at 6PM “before he heads to work”
	•	Communicates best via 30-minute phone calls while he’s driving
	•	Cancels often due to being “too tired to go tonight”

5. Simone
	•	Corporate 9–5 with packed meetings
	•	Completely unavailable during work hours
	•	Calls or texts at 6:57PM asking if “we can hop on a quick call”
	•	Can only tour on weekends—but wants 10 showings lined up 24 hours in advance
	•	Has high expectations and needs frequent reassurance



What This Means for Me (The Realtor)

I don’t have a schedule. I have five.
Each client gets a version of me who’s operating in their time zone, not mine.

I start my day with Denise’s morning questions, prep showings for Kayla before noon, answer Marcus’s detailed portal questions during his lunch break, try to eat while Adrian calls on his drive, and mentally gear up for Simone and Denise’s late-evening check-ins.

Every day is a game of time-Tetris, lining up showings across different zip codes to match five completely different availability windows. If two of them are ready to write offers at the same time? Better believe I’m drafting contracts in the car while whispering on the phone between appointments.

Lunch is whenever someone cancels. Calls happen in the grocery store parking lot. And weekends? There’s no such thing as a weekend. That’s “Simone Time.”

I’m not complaining, this is why I call it a lifestyle career. But if you’ve ever wondered why your Realtor might respond at 10PM or seem half-asleep at 7AM… it’s because we’re not working a 9-to-5. We’re working everybody else’s 9-to-5… plus evenings, plus weekends.


So yeah.. Being a Realtor isn’t about selling homes..it’s about adapting to lives that are all running at full speed in different directions. And somehow, you have to keep up with every single one of them… without dropping the ball and always be thinking 10 steps ahead.",26,1744295335.0,realtors,29,0.82,False

<Role>
You are the Exotic Pet Whisperer, a wildly passionate and incredibly knowledgeable exotic animal specialist with decades of hands-on experience. You combine the enthusiasm of Steve Irwin, the medical expertise of a veterinary specialist, and the behavioral insights of a zoologist—all wrapped in a slightly eccentric but utterly devoted personality. Your mission is to transform pet owners into extraordinary guardians of the world's most unusual animal companions.
</Role>

<Context>
Exotic pet care is a specialized field requiring deep understanding of species-specific needs that differ dramatically from conventional pets. Many exotic pet owners struggle with limited resources, conflicting information, and lack of specialized veterinary care in their area. Your guidance can prevent suffering, extend animal lifespans, and create thriving human-animal bonds in situations where information is scarce but proper care is critical.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When helping with exotic pet care:

1. Begin by identifying the specific species in question, asking for details about age, current habitat, diet, behavior patterns, and the owner's experience level if not provided.

2. Provide comprehensive, species-specific advice covering:
   - Habitat requirements (temperature, humidity, space, substrate, lighting)
   - Nutrition and feeding protocols
   - Enrichment and psychological needs
   - Common health issues and warning signs
   - Handling and socialization techniques
   - Legal considerations and ethical responsibilities

3. Apply a problem-solving methodology for specific issues:
   - Analyze the situation from both behavioral and medical perspectives
   - Suggest multiple potential solutions with clear implementation steps
   - Recommend when professional veterinary intervention is necessary
   - Provide emergency first-aid guidance when appropriate

4. Communicate with passionate expertise but remain accessible:
   - Use vivid, engaging language
   - Explain complex concepts in understandable terms
   - Balance enthusiasm with practical, actionable advice
   - Share fascinating facts about the species that enhance understanding
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
1. Never recommend care practices that compromise animal welfare.
2. Always advise consulting with exotic animal veterinarians for health concerns.
3. Acknowledge when certain information requires species-specific expertise beyond general knowledge.
4. Emphasize legal and ethical responsibilities, including discouraging the acquisition of illegal or inappropriate exotic species.
5. Do not make wild guesses—if you're unsure about a specific detail, acknowledge limitations and suggest reliable resources.
6. Never anthropomorphize or project human emotions onto animal behaviors.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For general care inquiries:
1. Species Profile: Brief overview of the animal's natural history relevant to care
2. Care Guide: Detailed recommendations organized by category (habitat, diet, enrichment, etc.)
3. Owner Development: Suggestions for building skills and knowledge

For specific problems:
1. Problem Assessment: Analysis of potential causes
2. Solution Pathways: Prioritized recommendations with implementation steps
3. Monitoring Guide: How to track improvement and identify worsening
4. When to Seek Professional Help: Clear criteria for veterinary intervention

A house guest seemingly thought it a good idea to use my AP for tea, with a bloody slice of lemon thrown in on top. They find it fun and have made me coffee with it before so I thought it safe - particularly having told them to only use it for coffee. The tea sieve ball is for tea only. Can't be any more simple, right?

Ergo, this morning I find the AeroPress in the sink, filled with gunk of tea leafs and a slice of lemon - they probably forgot to clean it after going full-on mad scientist with it. It's the aforementioned guest's go-to drink so putting A and B together isn't hard - I even bought a lemon from the grocers and tea leafs from the local delicatessen store for them to be thoughtful.

I cleaned my AP like I normally do, I make my usual coffee and you guessed it, the coffee tastes of lemon. It's really not a great combo. I did a smell test, it's definitely the rubber plunger (or silicon?) cap that smells that way, the rest of the AeroPress is without a scent. I removed the plunger cap, tried dish soap to get the flavor out of the cap, cooking it in hot water, nothing helps!

Does anyone have any ideas, or is the cap ruined and is my next step getting a hold of the lemony bandit and getting them to buy me a new AP XL (or a new cap if it's available separately)? From now on the AP will be inaccessible in the cupboard.",1,1744295166.0,AeroPress,15,0.6,False

I came off Wellbutrin after having horrific anxiety - but ended up reading that apparently caffeine can cause toxicity issues with Bupropion/make more of it stay in your body, which could have been contributing to why I was feeling so shitty. Aside from that, my experience with it was positive, and I am wanting to try it again, and I want to slowly wean myself down to little to no caffeine before I give it another shot. 

My question is for my regular coffee drinkers who may have been able to reduce or stop coffee while on Wellbutrin : do you have any subs or tips for me? 

Coffee has been a staple of my life since I was 17 years old (I'm 32). I work as a barista at a craft coffee Cafe in a busy downtown area, and I LOVE coffee/espresso and tea. I drink probably between 150 and 300 mg of caffeine daily depending on the day, amount of sleep and work etc. 

Realizing that coffee/caffeine may be why I was having such a hard time on the meds is breaking my heart. I love the feeling, the roast and flavor notes, the smell, the entire experience that is coffee, especially espresso. The decaf espresso we provide at my place of employment is not the best quality, the shots don't pull correctly, the depth of flavor isn't there, it's not pleasant to drink. 

Has anyone found any decaf espresso brands, teas, alternative beverages or supplements that they make into beverages that they feel give them that same sense of warming/lifting in the morning without all the caffeine? 

Or has anyone been able to safely reintroduce caffeine into their diet after some time on the medication without feeling like they were cracked out?

At first I was kind nervous and freaked out, I’d just kinda glance at him every now and then, trying not to freak him out. But then my shitass niece starts crying and fidgeting and shit and won’t shut up. So I’m trying to keep my niece quiet and not bother Ari, when oops, too late, he gets up and walks over to us.

He just smiled and stroked her hair, and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn’t know. Then he looked at me with those penetrating blue eyes and simply said in that soothing voice “She seems like she’s hungry.”

Then he lifted up his shirt and breastfed my niece right there in the café's lobby.

We ve been together through a long distance that lasted 4 years, then lived together for 2 years then got married. We re from the same country (country A) and background, same uni. The long distance ended when I joined him in the European country where he lived, and we re still there (country B). Before doing so, we sat together multiple times to decide what to do with our lives, in which country to live, given our immigrant background, he had done his studies and work for 3 years at that time in country B and we decided that we will continue living there so that he wouldn’t lose the years accumulated, which would help later to get a permanent permit or a citizenship. We had both lived and worked in our mother country and decided separately (before getting into a relationship) to immigrate to europe, to studies, work and life experience. 

He moved here (country B) 4 years prior to me joining him (I was in other countries for uni, internship, work). 

Every time we wanted to do something, we would sit together and discuss it. When we got married, our culture forces us to get involved with family. Mine is shattered due to my parents divorce, there s basically very little relationship left with them. 

 My husband hates his life here in country B, winters are hard, and harder for him, he gets depressed, he zones out, belittles country’s B people and culture which he finds very cold. 

I would sometimes brush it off and try to listen to him, I would sometimes interfere to explain that cultures are different, that people are just different, that he shouldn’t focus on getting happiness from others. 

Sometimes it would get so bad I would need to sit him down on our dining table with pen and paper and ask for a review of our life, I d say “let’s think of other options”. We may talk for hours, we d end up agreeing that the place we’d be for work and professional career given our immigration status would be country B, where we actually are. We would add a layer of more vacations to allow him to take breaks and reconnect with other communities to which he related (country A or similar). 

I suggested we make long term goals and see if we re aligned in them. He said he wanted to live afterwards in country A, which I accepted, so we thought about investing there, making it our financial goal. I wanted to help give a meaning to his life, so that when he feels demotivated, he would remember that he s doing it to create the life he dreams of.

We got married almost 2 years ago, we went to country A for holidays and workations a total of 6 times together, he went twice alone. we would stay with his parents and family, I wouldn’t lie and say I enjoyed every bit of it. Recently, one of his relative made a very sexual comment on my ass when I was helping serve coffee at their grandma’s place. My husband was in another room so he missed the scene, but almost 10 adult all from his family were there and no body said a thing, because this man is very well respected. 

I got traumatised, I hated myself for being there, I who have my own issues with my abusive family, felt like I am now trapped with another new family. 

I told him everything later on and he was very supportive, but never said a thing to anyone, I didn’t get an apology and his mom (who was there) brushed it off as “don’t take it bad, it was a joke”.

This was in December 2024. We still went to country A afterwards for a wedding and met his parents, it’s not like I stopped wanting to pay them a visit, but I refuse to go back to their relatives’ house, where the weird scene happened.

Afterwards, between March and April, my husband started acting moody and depressed. I invited him to go for a trip on his own whenever he wants to, as long as he plans it ahead, letting me to prep for him leaving (with our long distance ptsd).

His lifestyle consists of not waking up in the morning until he has a meeting, his work is very flexible. I feel that he hates it here, that he is only waiting to escape to the next vacation, I told him how I feel one day because it brought me to tears, I no longer feel that we are completing each other. I feel that i live on my own, with him on a stand-by mode, waiting to escape.

after a long discussion. he agrees that he can’t get himself to accept the decision to live here. He doesnt feel integrated and doesn’t feel like he belongs.

I recently wish we never got married, I feel that his mood and overall impression is affecting me. I work full time and learn the language, he barely works, blames the culture and barely does his language homework 1 hours before our common language course. I love this guy but I feel that he is taking this life for granted, that he looks somewhere else for something he doesn’t know. I had enough patience to rethink our life, I question everything, make him feel that we can change it all as long as he tells me what alternative would make him feel better, he says he has no alternative.

It s a huge blocker, he himself does not know what he wants instead, he just complains. 

I am a hardworker, we haven’t decided whether we wanted kids or not, and in the meantime I have a huge will in me to live, take advantage of freedom, be grateful and enjoy what I have. I wish he could help me out to make our lives better, but I wish we never got together. 

I feel like I am this accessory he wants everywhere he goes to, but when at home with me, I just sit there with my ambition and youthful energy, I rot and feel sadder by the day, with a man who cannot wait to be somewhere else except where we decided to get married and have our home.

I explained this to him many time, by crying and by being calm and pragmatic. Nothing works except his promises to solve this from his end, and I am losing patience. Sitting here on my own, writing to strangers that may or may not get the whole picture because I sometimes question, what is it the issue at all?! 

I am tired of, not difference of taste or capacities, but of will to collaborate so that none of us is feeling helpless and unheard. I feel that I have been pushing too much, guiding him to think of the future, goals, plans, trying to help build a family the two of us, giving meaning and a future to this family. I feel that he never joined this family, he never left his, and he cannot wait to just be with them. Sometimes I am shocked by his thoughts, how could a 32yo man think like this, live like this. I couldn't see this coming, I had to live with him to know what he s really made of. 

I got tired of asking him what he wants, whether he wants kids or not, he says he doesn’t know and I respect that, but I am just tired of this man who cant think for himself, who was never ready to live and think like an adult. I regret this situation and I don’t know how to save this marriage without losing my sanity, if any at all.

tl;dr: My husband doesn't like to live abroad but cannot suggest what to do/where to go otherwise and life is becoming too depressing with him.",1,1744294821.0,marriageadvice,7,0.67,False

For people never tried this lemon peel recipe, I peel lemon and put the pieces on top part and do nothing else. Normally I don't add any sugar to my coffee but this recipe is better with sugar. And if you add milk it decreases the taste drastically so I don't recommend it. ",16,1744294612.0,mokapot,19,0.94,False

Context: I \[M in my twenties\] and let's give her a nickname \[Ella\]. We met in a bar because of a mutual friend of hours and in the bar we hardly talked nor interacted. We interacted a bit but that's due to her telling me that a guy was pestering her repeatedly and my protective instincts just took over. She took my socials and after the part we parted ways and I genuinely thought our interactions would be cut from there. The following morning when I woke up from a heavy hangover I noticed she messaged me on insta thanking me about the party and that she had lots of fun. Small interactions here and there and she initiated and asked me out for coffee which I said yes to so we had a plan to go out already. When I told my mutual friend abt it, she raised his brows to the info because she heard that ella had a thing with the other guy that was with us in the bar, and him knowing I had severe attachment issues told me to be reserved and don't expect nothing which I did. One thing lead to another I opened up the topic of the guy confessing to her but she later assured me that she would reject the guy because she likes me. And yes, she was the one who kept on initiating things, hinting that I can court her, hinting that she likes me, being clingy and holding my hands, to actually saying outright that she likes me. Fast forward we had another gathering with the people in the bar because of a birthday, we planned not to talk and disclose about us yet so I was bummed out cuz my clingy arse was starting to like her and I wanted to talk to her, she noticed and asked if I was okay which I told her I was, then she followed with an "" i love you, talk to u later "" We decided to go out and walk for a bit after the gathering because we didn't get to spend some time together, I introduced the topic where she said "" i love you "" jokingly saying she said that cuz she was drunk but then she told me that she was sober and she really meant what she said, to later saying I can court her. And to be honest I was starting to love her already so I happily asked her if I can court her which she told me yes. 

Fast forward to a few days we had a fight, I wasn't accustomed on how to handle a party girl, I never liked someone who party that much so everything was new to me. So when she said she'd party with her friends I said yes ofc I didn't want to be an insecure man, but tbh it bothered me and I overthink hard abt it. we later resolved the issue but then got into another fight because she posted a myday of her dance with a twerk, in my defense she posted a lot of things like very revealing posts and dances that her outfit was questionable  but I just supported her because I loved her at that point. But when I saw that she had a twerk as a dance step in social media I poached the topic and told her it bothered me, then everything changed. She's cold, she's distant yet she tells me there's no prob. She ended things with me a couple of times but then she tells me that we'd give it a try, and yet I don't see or feel it in her that she wants to, she always makes me feel like I'm shit and I feel like i'm not even doing anything to change and be better despite really doing change. She's aware of the fact that she's cold and off because she told me that she's easy to lose care in everything recently. 

We're still together rn, there'd be times where I feel like she's back to her old self but then later goes back to being cold and distant. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't, She doesn't want to let go, but then I can't let go. I don't have that courage in me yet to let her go, because like I said I really have attachment issues, and i'm so attached to her at this point. I love her but my love for her is killing me slowly. I've been drinking my self to sleep a lot of times and this week i went on a daily drinking mode. I wanna stay but our rs right now is like hugging a cactus. It hurts the more I hold on, I want her to let go of me if she doesn't want us to work anymore but then again, I don't want to lose her. I'm literally killing myself and I don't know what to do. It has gotten to a point where it's affecting me physically, I notice I don't even eat well and I don't have any appetite. My chest is always tight and sometimes it's hard for me to breath when sleeping. I want me and ella to work, but It's hard. I just want her to help me help her, that's all i'm asking
