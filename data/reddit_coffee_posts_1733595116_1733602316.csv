Basically when I start the machine there is very little coffee coming out if I lock the portafilter strongly (then the machine just start to blink the second and third light ); and if I lock it too loosely the water comes out from the top of the portafilter.

I thought in the beginning it was the seal on the machine coupling but other people that have the same machine told me that it is the portafilter that stay in the ""closed"" position, since it is supposed to create a pressure chamber and then open up to let the coffee out at the right pressure.

I took apart the portafilter and cleaned it but it still does not engage as it should; so I want to replace it at this point, also because the metal inside is all ruined and dark anyway, after 4 years of ownership.

The problem is that I can't find in US anyone selling the part; so I am either going for a OEM part or a compatible one that could fit with the machine. Does anyone have any idea what can I use?

1h90zzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h90zzz/which_breville_espresso_machine_should_i_buy/,Which Breville espresso machine should I buy?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! After spending countless hours researching and testing various espresso machines, I thought I'd share my experience to help others who are in the same boat as I was a few months ago.

I recently decided to upgrade from my basic coffee maker to a proper espresso machine, and Breville quickly caught my attention. Their reputation for quality and user-friendly designs made them stand out, but I'll admit – choosing between their different models was overwhelming at first.

Let me break down what I've learned. The Barista Express is probably their most popular model, and for good reason. It's like the sweet spot between price and features. You get a built-in grinder (which is crucial for fresh espresso), and it's pretty straightforward to use. But here's the thing – if you're just starting out and want something simpler, the Bambino Plus might be a better choice. It takes up less counter space and still makes fantastic espresso.

For those who really want to dive deep into the espresso world, the Barista Pro or the Oracle Touch are worth considering. The Pro has a faster heating system and a more advanced display, while the Oracle is basically a cafe-quality machine for your home. Just keep in mind that with greater capabilities comes a steeper learning curve.

What really surprised me was how important the grinder is. If you're getting a Breville without a built-in grinder, you'll need to budget for a good separate grinder. Trust me, pre-ground coffee just doesn't cut it for proper espresso.

I've found that most Breville machines come with similar basic features – PID temperature control, decent pressure, and good steam wands for milk frothing. The main differences are in automation levels, grinder quality, and extra features.

You can check out the full range and current prices here: https://athometouch.com/breville

Temperature stability is another factor that impressed me with Breville machines. Even their entry-level models maintain consistent temps, which is crucial for getting that perfect shot. The pressure gauge (on most models) helps you dial in your shots, and the steam wands are powerful enough for creating that silky microfoam we all love.

Maintenance is pretty straightforward too. They all come with cleaning tools and indicators to let you know when it's time for a cleaning cycle. Just make sure to descale regularly, especially if you have hard water.

The one thing I wish someone had told me earlier is that there's a learning curve regardless of which model you choose. Don't expect cafe-quality drinks right away – it takes practice, but it's totally worth it.

Bottom line? If you're new to espresso making, the Bambino Plus or Barista Express are solid choices. For enthusiasts looking to step up their game, the Pro or Oracle Touch will give you room to grow. Just remember – the best machine is the one that fits your budget, space, and how much time you want to spend learning the craft.

Hope this helps someone make a decision! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models.",1,1733602091.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

However I normally wouldn’t spend the time dialing in a bag like that for espresso as I’ve come to assume that it wouldn’t be worth the time and effort. With that being said, I had some free time today and decided to try it out, and I have to say I was really impressed with the results. It tasted like it had definitely been roasted within the last few weeks, which is impressive considering the scale and breadth of their stores. For putting it in a milk drink as I did today, I think it might actually be the ideal coffee as it’s relatively cheap so I won’t feel bad about not tasting every note the way I might with an expensive single origin.

I’m trying to be more patient with this dog so I let him sat on my lap, he was there a while and then I started getting a small whiff of poop. I think he had a bit of poop remains on his butt and I got it on my clothes and hands which sent me to a breakdown and a spiral. I absolutely can not stand my boyfriend’s dog, I do believe he babies him way too much and I don’t want to make him choose between  the baby/me and the dog. 

The dog always has to sleep with us at night which I’ve grown used to, and it’s not just on the bed he has to sleep, in it’s in between our legs which is already uncomfortable af. He learned that he can’t sleep like that with me so now he doesn’t bother me, thankfully. 
He doesn’t like when I kiss my boyfriend or cuddle with him. When we want to get intimate the dog remains the bed and doesn’t want to get down- but obvs we kick him off. 
The dog has a meal time of 4 in the morning and after I feed him I put him in his kennel so we can sleep comfortably and my boyfriend gets upset at me. The dog doesn’t even eat his food if I’m the one serving him! 

The thing that really ticked me off the most was that every time the dog gets mad at me he would go pee on our coffee table, the nice coffee table I bought for us. Im the only one working at the moment and I’m obviously trying to make a comfortable space for my baby and all of us but he’s just a little pos who I can’t deal with any longer! 

Please someone just talk to me and tell me I’m not that crazy. I am working hard on being loving towards him because it’s someone my boyfriend loves but I don’t want to make my bf choose. What can I do?? 


Also might I add- his original owner got pregnant a couple of years ago and gave my bf the dog because she couldn’t handle him and was “too much” and now I have to deal with him while 22 weeks pregnant. Idk just upset ",1,1733601979.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Here’s the situation:

I was at a New York gala fundraiser, a rare visit to my hometown, where I was reconnecting with old friends and even receiving an award for my work in my non-profit. It was supposed to be a celebratory evening. Instead, I found myself accosted by a man I didn’t know, who berated me, calling me names like “Jezebel” and “harlot.”

This man had been staring at me all night—not in a flattering or curious way, but more like “ I owed him money” way.  At the coat check, he cornered me and accused me of being part of his wife’s painful past, claiming I’d ""stolen her partner"" and “baby-trapped” my now husband  into marriage.

Shocked but not one to back down, I calmly asked him who he thought I was.  He revealed he was Becca’s husband—Becca being someone I’d once been friendly with—and accused me of betraying her. According to him, I had thrown myself at (her then  partner and my current husband), Emmett, trapped Emmet away from her causing Becca's trust issues.

With the coat check attendant as my only audience, but good enough to be witness- I was comfortable clarifying a few key points:

1. When Becca met Emmett, he  was my plus-one to this same gala years ago. Becca had even sent a friend to ask if Emmett was my boyfriend, and I replied ""its complicated""  (We weren't dating at the time but our history was to dirty to recommend him). 
2. Emmett and I married nearly 2 year  before we had our first child, so the idea of “baby-trapping” was absurd.
3. Becca pursued Emmett by waiting for him at a cab stand and giving him her card. They met three times after. The only reason I know this- because when their brief connection fizzled after three dates, she caused a stir among mutual acquaintances by spreading various versions of the story.

The man, who had started as a lion, quickly turned into a sheep, then slithered away like a snake.

Later, back at my table, my friend Eve filled me in on more details. Apparently, Becca and her husband had been watching our table all night. Unlike her husband, Becca had even congratulated me earlier with a fake-nice tone.  Hmmm - sad. 

My husband Emmett sitting there- chimed in that  his time with Becca’s consisted of one coffee, one drink, and being her plus-one to a wedding, as she didn’t want to go alone . He stayed only an hour.

As I sipped my drink, I was getting the tea,

 

I get where Becca's coming from. I really do. I’ve had my fair share of judgment from my mom, dad, and the rest of my family. I was always the odd one out—the black sheep. So when you get an approval worthy date it can be brag worthy. 

Ironically, Emmett and I met as fellow black sheep at a wedding, bonding over being the family  underachiever. He’d just been ditched by his ex-fiancée, and I was again unemployed.  Somewhere between awkward toasts and forced smiles, I joked about going to grad school as my ""loser insurance."" It resonated.   Our follow up “ hang” was pouring over applications.  

When I got accepted into a program in Paris, he didn’t hesitate to come blurring the lines of our friendship for the next four years. He came with me. . No parents, no overachieving siblings, no old friends parading their picture-perfect lives. It was just us, carving out space to be unapologetically imperfect—losers, until we weren’t.  By the time we made it back to the States, we were no longer just black sheep. We were *Dr.* Black Sheep, with real jobs. Had I stayed state side while figuring my stuff out- I would have went crazy.

So, yeah, if being the villain in Becca’s story helps her save face, I’ll play the role gladly. Say less. I’ve been here before, and trust me—I’m okay with it.

But

Still, I can’t excuse her husband’s behavior. On a night I was especially proud of my achievements, being ambushed by someone else’s unresolved narrative was unfair. Had he not, I would have not. 

So, am I the asshole for setting the record straight with her husband?",2,1733601874.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

those are just my reasonings and I know they're not rock solid 100% of the time, I know baristas who don't really care at all about the quality of the espresso or cleanliness behind the bar out of sight line and can't even dial in but they can do beautiful art and swans and it's because presentation is emphasized in that shop over anything else and they're located in a prime, constantly busy location. and I also know baristas who are SUPER into coffee, incredibly talented people, but just simply don't care at all about the art. or it's just something they never mastered for a huge variety of reasons and has zero impact on their talent and passion and quality of their espresso and milk and work ethic.

1h90vmp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h90vmp,Budget Breakdown on my £20k French Riviera chateau wedding ,"

Goal: To pull off a £50k+ wedding for £20k✨

*Due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up organising the vast majority (florals, music, rentals, staffing, food, booze, decor) in the 2 weeks before the wedding*

I’m an experiential events planner by trade, at the start of the year both my husband and I were each earning 6 figures and had plenty of cash to splash on our wedding, we’re not big savers but had accounted for all spare cash from Jan to be going towards the wedding. However this year has thrown us some curveballs including both of us losing our jobs, my MH hitting new lows, my grandma dying, and us long term relocating to Costa Rica, which has meant my r/bigbudgetbrides wedding went out the window…After some tears and the hard realisation that the date couldn’t be moved, I went ahead with planning my champagne taste wedding on my now cava budget 🥲

My top priority was not feeling like I’d compromised the quality of the wedding, it may not have all the extra details I wanted or the level of guest experience I had hoped for, but it will still feel elegant, elevated and purposeful. In terms of “picking your hard” I decided stress & extreme DIY was the hard I could manage vs spiralling extra costs or a more understated affair. 

Total guest count: 33 Total Spend £22.176

Destination: French Riviera Chateau, 20 minutes from Cannes

What we were covering: All food and booze for Welcome Party & Wedding Day + venue which included accommodation for the week for all those in the wedding party and close family (22) + Bridesmaid gifts 

Welcome Party: *£500* We did a pizza party for the welcome night and just ordered 20 pizzas from a great local restaurant, I went to Carrefour that morning and bought a load of good wine and beer and I designed and printed the sign myself on Vista Print, I had planned to have checked table cloths and vases with flowers to make it more “Italian Restaurant” but due to having 1 week to order and plan most of this the orders wouldn’t arrive on time :( *this was the case for all decor, hence low budget* 

-Flights: Ugh. We live in Costa Rica but had to fly back to the uk first to pick things up, all in both ways with luggage and home again was around *£5k*

-Ceremony Look: Dress *RRP £5k, I paid £1k*  Caroline Castigliano bought off Still White (I lost 30 lbs in 6 months to slim into this gown!) + Vintage Versace couture jacket for evening *£30 from eBay* + St Pucci Veil *RRP £3k, paid £35 on eBay* Shoes Alberta Feretti heels *RRP £700, paid £43* + D&G trainers *RRP £800 paid £30*

-Second Look: Vintage Nicolette by Sophia Tolli corset *£12* + 1980s wedding dress from eBay I had altered into a skirt *£50 + £20 alterations* + Gigi & Olive hair bow

-Grooms Attire: full fitted Tux + shoes form a tailors in London £800 

-Wedding week outfits: I went on a thrifty shopping spree across eBay and Vinted - *£1000*

-Hair & Makeup: I did it myself but did buy perfume and new makeup at a guess I’d say I spent £400 but this is also including makeup/skincare I had to buy anyway 

-Wedding Planner: This was the thing I was most upset to be losing from my OG budget… I took this on myself and with everything else going on it was very difficult to manage, this was exacerbated by both choosing a destination where I don’t speak the language and me being an introvert with a low social battery who’s planned a week long wedding with 2/3s of the guests staying onsite 🙃 we did no rehearsal so had a bit of a stumble on the aisle, forgot to cut the cake and forgot to do the first dance til after the photographer had left.

-Florals: I went to the local florist the day before the wedding and through Google trans, explained I wanted every white and pink flower in the shop + bouquets, they charged me *£500* for the lot. I picked them up the morning of my wedding 

-Decor: Everything was scoured from the venue minus the *£300* I spent on candles from Zara, I paid a *£200* deposit for furniture rentals but in the end we didn’t use them as it was £2k for the sake of matching tables… Instead I bought some matching white table clothes from Carrefour during the food shop and we put all the tables we could find in the chateau together. We also reused the flowers from the ceremony space on the table. 

Glassware/tablewear etc was all provided by the chateau in spades, we had 4 different types of plates to chose from and I didn’t have to rent any additional serving bowls etc 

-Rings: all secondhand, engagement ring is Tiffany RRP £10k, he paid £3k + bands his 14ct gold *£121* mine 9ct gold band with diamonds *£185* both secondhand jewellers 

-Venue: Chateau de Vaucouleurs!!! I honestly can’t rave about this place enough, it is truly a hidden gem and a total seal at *£5k* for the entire week (this also varies with time of year, we went cheapest month and the weather gods shone on us. Literally). The only downside was WiFi was out and many rooms were dead zones for data due to chateau walls. No wifi + self catering = some fall outs 

-Food: *hahahaha… Sobs* So I’ll preface this by saying I’m a very good home cook, as is my whole family (my dad literally used to be a chef) I stupidly decided after being unable to find anything even half decent for less than £5k to just “do it myself” 🙂 So, the day before the wedding (the day of the welcome party, after spending weeks stressing and planning leading up to this) I go to carrefour with my father and spend £1500 on food and then me, my mom, my dad, my sister and the poor unfortunate souls I manage to rope in spend the day prepping all the food; including full salmons, caviar blinis, risotto, spaghetti and meatballs, charcuterie boards, beef birria, salads, BBQ chicken, quiches, potatoes and more (all nut free but also catering to vegan and veggies). Our cake was 3 raspberry tarts from Carrefour. We ended up catering for 60+ and literally fed everyone for 2 days post wedding. *It cost me £1500 and my sanity* I will also never do self catering with family again or cater an event of this scale 🙂

-Staffing: Because it was so extreme DIY we did most of the set up ourselves, and coordination ourselves, however I did hire 2 waitstaff for the meal + to clean after *£200*

-Music: Harpist was found on Facebook 3 days before the wedding, she played for 4h *£450* 

One of my husbands Best Men is a DJ so he brought his decks, we also brought our very large Sonos speaker and hooked it up to our Spotify, worked like a charm and cost *£0* 

-Booze: We went full open bar, we hired a 4hour unlimited cocktail bar which came with 2 bartenders and our choice of 4 signature cocktails (*£2k* - they had a challenge to “drink them dry” apparently it never happens, we managed it an hour early 😅) we also provided champagne, and copious amounts of wine and beer on all tables (*£1k* on extra booze) 

-Photographer : *£1k* (8h during wedding + 2h photoshoot on a separate day) Florent was honestly amazing! He understood the assignment so well I may do a separate post just talking about my process of finding the photographer of my dreams on such a small budget in such a HCOL area! 

-Gifts: Wedding favours are packets of CR coffee, I designed the packaging on vista print and we filled them ourselves *£200* . Bridesmaids gifts were designer dresses bought with each of them in mind (also included Mom and MIL) all second hand but bnwt *£250* + hair accessories for bridesmaids *£50* 

Extras: We threw a 1920s themed celebration the day after the wedding which we initially hadn’t planned on covering booze and food for but ended up doing so in part thanks to a surplus from the wedding, we spent an *£300* on more booze 

Total Spend coming in at £22.176, I am so thrilled with what we achieved for the price tag! We are doing the actual legal bit after Burning Man in Lake Tahoe next summer, eloping just the 2 of us and we’re upgrading our wedding bands as our anniversary gift to ourselves, I’ll share photos of the elopement next year! 💕

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",2,1733601628.0,SimulationTheory,0,1.0,False

Here’s my thoughts and feel free to AMA! ,"First of all, it’s beautiful. We stayed in the F&F Sundeck Suite with our family of 4. Kids 12 and 17. It was perfect. The deck was EVERYTHING! We loved spending time on it. Watching the sunrise every morning with our coffee was a highlight. 

We ordered a ton of room service, my kids thought it was awesome it was 24 hours. Highly recommend the vegan ceviche and churros 🤤  it always came quicker than expected and perfectly hot or cold. 

Mini fridge was fully stocked with water, Gatorade, soda, chocolate milk and beer. 

The hotel was definitely still working on stuff, but nothing that got in the way of our vacation or was disruptive. It’s mostly the top floor suites that were getting the work done I believe. 

The first floor has all the bars, restaurants, shops and extra amenities. My kids did bowling and the race cars. It was maybe $10/20 bucks for each for those. They also had lazer tag, priced about the same. There was always some deal tho for those activities, like pay for 3 bowlers get the 4th free. I did not find it unreasonable, but also I went there knowing I would be paying extra for those. 

We ate at Copal. Black Iron, Veranda, Livo and Kita. 

Black Iron and Livo were phenomenal. With Livo being out absolute favorite. 

But, eveything was very good. My son has a nut allergy and they went above and beyond to take caution for him. Even when ordering room service. I was impressed honestly. 

At the pools/bay you order from your waiter using a QR code. And it was honestly some of the best poolside food I’ve had an AI. Highly recommend the sliders, wings and ceviche! 

The Bay is…nice but boring. I would say that my biggest complaint about this trip is that the water obstacle course wasn’t open the whole time and you can’t even swim in the deep part of the bay bc they just use it for kayaking and paddle boarding. We spend all our time at the family pool and it was lively! It did get kinda crowded as the afternoon went on but that’s to be expected. The south end of the property has an awesome adults only pool area. We weren’t able to spend time there as we were with our kids but I wish we could have. 

The beach is coming along beautifully! We loved walking the length of it every day. It was red flags the whole time so no ocean swimming but that’s not our jam anyways so no loss there. (Others ignored the flags and were swimming so it’s not enforced I don’t think) They work diligently to keep it clear tho, and it wasn’t seaweed ridden or gross in the least bit. 

Can’t really speak to the nightlife bc we spend our night after dinner on our deck. 

We did get messages and they were also wonderful. We had Blanca and Adela and they were so respectful and professional and I was definitely sad I didn’t get the 80 minute treatment! The spa is massive, it’s gorgeous and relaxing. My husband and son also loved the gym. Tons of equipment. 

All in all, we loved it. We will return simply for the proximity to the airport. Took us ten minutes once we got our transportation. And we didn’t need to leave the resort hours and hours before our flight home either bc it was so close. 

I wouldn’t let any of the earlier reviews deter anyone, they are finding their footing and this place is great. Let me know if I can answer any questions!

1h90pk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1h90pk1/would_my_roommates_be_considered_flaky/,Would my roommates be considered flaky?,"I graduated college back in May of this year, 2024. I work part-time at a coffee shop and do freelance broadcast work for my old college's athletics department. I have found a full time job yet as this job market sucks. But I make enough to make ends meet, but it could be better financially.

I and two other girls rent an apartment. The rent total every month is $1,495. I pay $485, another pays $485, and the third pays $525 since she has the master room. The utilities are then paid separately, and they range every month between $40-$80.

I moved in back in early September, after living there for only a couple days, I had already paid the rent, utilities, security deposit, etc when I first moved in, which happened to be the day that rent was due.

They then both texted me saying ""Hey, there's another $45 in the app we use to pay electronically, could you pay it please?"" I was confused, as I had calculated all of the amounts I had to pay and there was no more money left for me to pay. But I was wanting to be nice to my new roommates, so I paid it.

One roommate, whose name is on the utility bills, on two separate occasions asked for the utility amounts once 2 weeks before the rent was due, and the other a few days before the due date. I said ""No, I will be paying them when the rent is due"". She said ""ok"". But I just felt it was weird. Why do you need them so early? And don't the amounts for the utilities get released the same time the rent is due?

ugh idk 😑.

The two main problems that sparked this question both happened earlier this week.

I paid the rent on time, rent and utilities together.

I got an email the next day saying ""Insufficient Funds"". Apparently one of the roommates under paid on the rent. It then went on to say that since this is the THIRD offense (which means it has happened more than once and I don't think from the same roommate), all of us lose the privilege to pay electronically thru our renting app. We have to physically take cash or check to the renter's office. Which it's not the end of the world, but it's still inconvenient.

There was a letter at the bottom of the email stating which roommate it was and what we would have to do here on out to pay the rent.

I was pissed. Then a couple days later, I woke up early for work around 6am. I saw a text from one of the roommates saying that I needed to pay the rent. I was very confused. Here's how it went:

Me: I did pay the rent.

Her: Huh, then what is this pending payment in the system?

Me: What are you talking about?

Her: This right here, \*sends a screenshot of pending payment\*

Me: I promise it's not mine. My payment went thru on Tuesday. (Today is Thursday).

Me: \*sends screenshot of my payment going thru\*

Her and other roommate: Well, it has to be yours. I don't know who else's it could be.

Me: \*inwardly\* 🙄😡

I was so mad, and I was crying from this unnecessary stress and anxiety. There was NO WAY I was making another payment, that would close to $1000 in one week, which is money I do not have.

I texted both my parents to call the office and try and sort this out for me. One because I would be at work all day, and two, my mom is a guarantor on the lease so she could call them on my behalf.

After a few hours, my dad called me. We talked and he told me that everything is perfectly fine on my end.

I then learned that it was my OTHER roommate's (the one who originally texted me to pay the rent) payment that was pending. Not mine.

I was like ""Girl, if you had just gone down there (the office is a 2 minute walk from our apartment) or called, you could have easily gotten your answer"".

I was so annoyed. Why would they immediately think it was my payment? Why point the finger at me right out the gate?

They were once so excited for me to move in with them. But it seems like they just wanted someone to fill a financial gap. But it's whatever. I'm going to put some distance between myself and them. If they talk to me first, then fine. But I will not initiate. They are not my friends, just people I live with.

Anyway, I just need some advice.

I'm going to stick it out until May, then re-evaluate my options. Even though my lease is up over the summer, my mom says ""I don't want you to stay there longer than you feel like you need to"". Yes, I want to dip out of there as soon as possible.

I will pay my rent for May, then my parents will probably help with rent for June and July and I will just drop of those payments to the office for them to process once the payment dates come.

Lastly and luckily, my parents are saying that I am more than welcome to come back home if I need to, so if that is what it comes to, then I will do that.

P.S. I also paid $25 for the bar stools THEY (the roommates) wanted for the island in the apartment's kitchen, so when I move homes or cities, then I'm taking them with me. (And my mom paid for the couch, so if we wanted, we could take that too).✌🏻",1,1733601316.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

The number of coffee cups all over his office and the cigarettes, which can be seen all over his desk in an ashtray, show his issues. It would make sense to pick up smoking after such a rough six years. There are also multiple whiskey bottles and references to drinking. While it’s a silly joke, his mug states, “My other mug is a hip flask.” He also has a bottle of liquor in his office and another shot of whiskey in his room. Chris Hackett also has heart medication. While it’s unclear in the story why he is on heart medication, it is interesting. Is it linked to his vices? His condition? Or was he born with a heart issue? It’s all so interesting. However, I wanted to point it out.  There is also a pack of cigarettes in the radio hut. It raises another question of whether he smokes out there cause it's far away from the campers.

Sometimes I feel nothing at first, but then when I look the person up, I start overthinking everything and get anxious, thinking it’s never going to work out. I don’t even want to meet the person after that.

I have low self-esteem and know I might not look good. It feels like I’d just embarrass myself if I went to meet the person. I’ve told my mom that I don’t want us to send pictures (because of my self-esteem, although I haven’t told her that because she wouldn’t understand).

Now there’s a potential match, and I’ve looked him up a little on social media. I think we have very different personalities, and his looks aren’t really my “type.” But I also know I shouldn’t judge someone just based on a picture, as I’ve often found that people who don’t look good in photos look much better in real life. Still, I don’t want to meet him because I’m scared of his reaction, especially since I’ve gained a bit of weight recently, which makes my confidence even worse.

His mom suggested that we meet for coffee together with our moms, but I don’t think it’s going to work. It feels like it’ll just be awkward with our moms there, and he won’t like how I look, and the whole thing will go terribly wrong. I regret telling my mom that I wasn’t okay with sending a picture, because I’d rather have sent one so he could at least be a little prepared and I wouldn’t feel like I’m “embarrassing” myself.

People have told me I’m pretty, but I think they’re just trying to be nice.

He lives, works, and has an apartment in a big city, and I’ve always said that I don’t want to live in a big city. I prefer quiet areas, and I also think it’s better for children to grow up in those kinds of environments. I’m almost certain that this man wouldn’t want to move away from his area. I told my mom to ask his mom about it, but she just said, ‘You’ll have to meet him and bring it up yourself.

I would have preferred to first talk to him via text or phone (respectfully) before meeting in person, but I know that might be seen as inappropriate, and my parents probably wouldn’t agree to it.

i believe life and afterlife are like two sides on the same coin. I also believe, that the afterlife is similar two the afterlife in ""Helles Belles"" from ""sea.ya.later"". I theorize, that the ""living"" Hell and Seraphim-Realm are pieces of Hell and Heaven that are on the third side of the coin and adjacent to the living side.   
Things that are working with the theory:

* Lucifer has a place in ""living"" Hell, where he trades coffee for hellfire-essence with Bob and Cyrus, like in the crossover-episode ""A favour from the fae"" on the TikTok of ""Sarcastic Sinner 666""
* The Seraphim are hyper-aggressive Angels, banished to the Seraphim-Realm with no way back
* The demons in ""living"" Hell are demons from afterlife Hell, who don't want to life there.
* ""Helles Belles"" can be an adjacent universe
* Lucifer tells nothing directly about the afterlife, so Bob truly doesn't know anything about the afterlife

1h90hnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1h90hnf/aiomy_goddaughters_are_being_abused_and_i_dont/,AIO-My Goddaughters are being abused and I don’t know what to do ,"I’m in a very weird situation with my family life so I’ll make a long story short- my goddaughters are 18 months and 4, they have an older sister that is 13. I have been their only mother since the 4 year old was 15 months old and I have gotten closer to their grandparents who have custody of them. 
Their mother was a fentanyl addict who died shortly after giving birth to my youngest daughter. I have taken partial custody because both grandparents are ill and tbh they cannot parent. One of their children died and the other is in prison, not to be harsh but that’s the reality. None of their fathers are in the picture. A couple days ago the grandparents completed the adoption and I was supposed to be signed as their legal guardian but instead I waited at the courthouse entertaining my daughters while they completed all the paperwork and did not include me.

Both girls call me mama and the family has been supportive in making sure I build a relationship with them because they need a mother. their grandma recently went through liver failure and their grandpa has COPD. I moved to be closer to the kids into an expensive city and now I’m struggling just to afford my bills. I constantly make sacrifices because they allow their 13 year old granddaughter to run the house and even though she is a terribly behaved kid, she is spoiled beyond belief. She recently got a pony and is getting an XBOX and an iPhone for Christmas type spoiled… just to clarify- the 13 year old is not my goddaughter. She was born when her mom was a teenager and still in high school so she has been primarily raised by the grandparents. 

SO, my 4 year old lives with me Sunday night through Friday and my 18 month old only stays with me from Sunday through Wednesday because her Papa has a weird attachment to her and will not let me have her for more time. They spoil the baby- constantly holding her, giving her candy, COFFEE, and plenty of other sh*t that a baby should not have or have in moderation. She literally has pudding for dinner and refuses to nap in their house. Then she comes home and acts like a spoiled brat, screaming, hitting, biting, etc. 

My 4 year old is constantly being hurt, scared, and abused by her older sister. I have seen the older sister ride past my daughter on her bike and literally kick her over and then laughs when she cries. She teases her until she cries and tells her things like “your dolls come alive at night to kill you”. Now the kicker—Recently my daughter has been telling me that her older sister touches her privates but it’s ok because “they love each other”. She has also gotten out of the bath and showed me her clitoris and tried to explain to me what it does and that you’re supposed to put it in your mouth… when I ask her who is teaching her these things she says “sissy”. I have documented all the times that she has said something like that and it has been reported to CPS, however, the report was made several weeks ago and nothing has happened. I was advised to take her for a forensic interview but because they still have not legally designated me as their guardian I can’t do it. 

I reached out to the grandparents and suggested that we take both girls for an interview but they have left me with a series of excuses: 
1- they think it’s just my daughter’s imagination 
2- they were both abused as kids and they’re “fine”
3- it will ruin the teenagers life
4- it probably only happened once and it’s not still happening 
5- since my daughter “isn’t acting abused” she’s going to be fine. 
6- the grandpa thinks it’s an all out lie
They are constantly saying the kids are “fine” and there’s no need for the drama. 

I have told them that I do not want the kids left alone together because the teenager has issues- she has written full pages about graphic sexual acts and I found out that my daughter told her months ago that she and her sister give each other “massages”. I’m beyond done with the inappropriate language and behavior that the oldest sister has been teaching my daughter and I’m freaking out over what the future looks like because I will have to pick up these pieces when the grandparents are gone.

Side note and not as important but I am extremely bothered by how the grandparents act like they do everything for the kids and they get constant praise for it. I am never acknowledged publicly however they do tell me privately that they could not do this alone.. I am paid $1000 a month to care for the children. I know that’s not enough but I am doing this because I love these kids and I’m the only mother either one of them has known. As a former foster kid it seemed like I made the right choice because someone adopted me at 11. I am now feeling regretful about moving closer and feeling like I may never really have these kids and I cannot keep them safe if the abuser is in the house.. I’m tired of my life with these girls revolving around their older sister and what she wants.

Now the family is talking about buying property and a farm for the teenager to continue 4h and so we can all be together. I just want to take these babies and run but I legally can’t and I can’t abandon them now so I’m feeling very stuck and like my life is being taken over by these people. I do love them and consider them family but that doesn’t mean I need to put up with their toxicity. I don’t know what to do! TIA if you read this far, I really needed to get this off my chest and I can’t talk.

I'm still unsure if I'll go Cold Turkey or not, but thought I'd at least try one day without and see how I go. So far it's bearable but lets see what tomorrow brings.

Coffee reliant since I was a teen, so around 35 years on the stuff. My usual intake is two brewed cups before I leave the house, then maybe three or four cups of tea up until lunch time. A couple of times a week I'll treat myself to a chai latte.

My main reasons for quitting is that my sleep is really poor. I struggle badly with brain fog and lack of energy in the evenings so hoping this might help. I'm more interested in improving sleep quality than quantity, but will take an extra half hour if its available.

Just had the migraine all day, and have popped a couple of NSAIDS to help with the pain. Will look into ordering some caffeine free herbal teas. I have been tapering down a little bit but I don't know if that approach is for me.  
  
Don't think I could even have attempted this without reading the success stories here. I'm fed up being addicted to this stuff and I want to see what life like without it and to give my body a chance to heal.

What are application in daily Life? ,"Rahatism, as a philosophy and a lifestyle emphasizing comfort, relaxation, and inner peace, could be seen as a response to the fast-paced, high-stress modern world. Here's an outline of what such a philosophy look like:

Core Principles of Rahatism:

1. Simplicity: Embrace a life of simplicity to reduce unnecessary stress and complexity.


2. Mindfulness: Focus on being present in the moment, appreciating small joys, and avoiding distractions.


3. Balance: Prioritize a healthy balance between work, rest, and leisure.


4. Comfort: Create an environment—physical, mental, and emotional—that promotes well-being and tranquility.


5. Non-attachment: Avoid excessive materialism or dependence on external circumstances for happiness.


The Rahatist Manifesto

1. Contentment is the Goal: Happiness doesn’t come from more—it comes from enough. Seek satisfaction in the present.


2. Peace Over Productivity: Strive for quality of life, not endless achievements.


3. Simplicity is Strength: Complexity adds stress; simplicity fosters clarity.


4. Connection Over Competition: Value cooperation and empathy over rivalry.


Practices in Rahatism:

Daily Relaxation: Set aside time each day for relaxation, whether through gentle exercise, or quiet reflection.

Gratitude: Regularly express gratitude for what brings comfort and peace into life.

Healthy Boundaries: Learn to say no to stress-inducing commitments or people.

Nurture Relationships: Surround yourself with supportive, positive individuals who contribute to your sense of ease.


Rahatism vs. Hedonism:

While both philosophies are not same. Rahatism care about the divine rule whereas hedonism male human nihilist and self centric in this magnificence narcissistic mundane earth. Rahatism places greater emphasis on sustainable well-being and inner peace rather than the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake. It's about a state of harmony rather than indulgence.


____ 

Here’s a more detailed look at Rahatism and how it can be integrated into daily life as a lifestyle philosophy:


---

Foundations of Rahatism

1. Philosophical Roots:

Draws from traditions of mindfulness e.g. minimalism, and even monotheism (which values inner peace and detachment).

Values contentment over ambition, emphasizing that a peaceful God defined life is the true measure of success.



2. Core Belief:
Life’s purpose is not in relentless striving but in cultivating contentment, spiritual well-being, and harmony within oneself and one's surroundings.




---

Principles in Daily Practice

1. Physical Comfort:

Create a home environment that feels calm and welcoming—focus on soft lighting, decluttered spaces, and cozy furnishings.

Wear clothes that prioritize comfort while reflecting your personality.



2. Mental Peace:

Practice mindfulness techniques to manage stress, like deep breathing, journaling, or praying 

Limit exposure to negative news or social media. Curate your mental diet as much as your physical one.



3. Social Harmony:

Build a community of people who bring positivity. Let go of toxic relationships or either toxic friends or circumference. 

Practice forgiveness and avoid unnecessary conflicts.



4. Pacing Yourself:

Work with intention but avoid overburdening yourself with productivity pressures.

Value leisure and rest as equally important to success.



5. Contentment:

Reflect daily on things that bring you joy or peace—small rituals like morning coffee, a walk in nature, or time with loved ones.

Shift focus from ""what’s missing"" to ""what’s here now.""

Practical Applications

Here are some ways Rahatism can be applied to modern life:

1. Morning Routine: Start with Peace

Avoid rushing. Create a ritual: a warm drink, light stretching, or silent reflection.

Set intentions for the day with a focus on calmness.


2. Simplify Decision-Making

Limit choices to reduce decision fatigue. For example, keep a capsule wardrobe or meal plan for the week.


3. Technology Boundaries

Use tech for convenience, but disconnect regularly to maintain focus and reduce mental clutter.


4. Flexible Work-Life Integration

Choose work or hobbies that bring satisfaction and align with personal values.

Embrace breaks to recharge rather than pushing through exhaustion.


5. Evening Wind-Down Rituals

Light a candle, listen to soothing music, or read a book to signal relaxation at the end of the day.

Reflect on moments that brought peace or joy.

Benefits of Rahatism

1. Stress Reduction: Cultivating comfort and peace helps in managing stress effectively.


2. Improved Relationships: A relaxed and content person often fosters better connections with others.


3. Sustainable Happiness: Unlike fleeting pleasure, Rahatism aims for lasting inner satisfaction.


4. Healthier Living: A balanced life improves mental and physical health.

And sense then they added timber wolfs which was a big difference in how the game was, adding something with a “morale/health bar”, never seen before in the game, or anything really close to it. Since then they have stayed away from the realistic survival game in favor of prioritizing fun gameplay, which isn’t a bad thing at all. It just seems like it’s not the original idea. It’s completely possible that the devs want the game to be different then it was, but if they do, I hope they do still honor the wishes of the players that have been here for a long time. 

I love the idea of the trader, it makes surviving 1000+ days way more possible without straining on every resource, that isn’t renewable, antibiotics, flour, salt(even though salt is way more abundant now). The cougar I don’t think is done in quite the right way, it forces you to move on to another region, or just makes it inconvenient to stay. Instead I think they should have made more of an incentive to travel more, such as the forges, ammo crafting, and now the trader. I just believe giving a reward is more powerful and fun than giving a punishment.

I’ve seen some discussion about the logo too, I personally don’t like the change, it went from something that represents the game they make very well, and the logo was as recognizable as the game itself. The new logo is just generic, it could be anything that starts with H. I do think the original logo will stay in the game indefinitely on the coffee mug, as I really hope it does.

I started on 30mg elvanse at the end of August and jumped up to 50mg after 3 weeks. 

I’ve had no real issues on the side effect path until the last two weeks. I was being more proactive and enthusiastic when I’d started as I was waiting so long and always dreamt of the day I could try something that could help, and boy has it helped. 

So for the first month or so I was being great and eating a good amount of protein to help feel the benefits longer and to stop with the unwanted symptoms, but that didn’t last as long as I hoped… I’m still doing a lot better with my water intake than before but over the last 2 weeks because it’s been so busy in work my appetite has gone out the window. I go the whole day without anything to eat and just keep having coffee to keep me going. But now by the time dinner time comes, I know I’m hungry, but anything in my mouth just feels so wrong. 

I cook when I get home and sit with my partner to eat but most nights by the time I’ve even taken the first bite, she’s finished her plate. I get about 5 mouthfuls in and my gag reflex starts going to the point I just can’t eat it and it goes in the bin. 

I’m really feeling it in my body with going so long without much food and I’m so worn down and so irritable but I just don’t know how to force myself.

I have been no contact with my mom for 10 years.  also no contact with my whole family. 

My former friend, who is actually much older than me I met her at a library job, and I got coffee after many years of not seeing each other. She knows my parents as she has seen them since I ended contact with my parents.

She brought them up once 5 years ago and then I told her I would appreciate not bringing them up in conversation as they are nice people but I don’t respect them. 

On our coffee interaction she brought them up and told me I could not answer the question, which was respecting my previous boundary. I told her briefly that that relationship was toxic and when she told me a few things about my family members I honestly wasn’t that interested in what they are doing. She was brief also. 

When I mentioned briefly that my mom and I both aren’t bad people but that the relationship was toxic, I think I also followed with you know my mom and sister have each other which I felt she cringed at. She has 3 daughters and 1 son and I know that since she brought them up, still respecting my initial boundary but still bringing them up nonetheless, she doesn’t agree with my no contact decision.

I still know I am in the right my parents were abusive and toxic emotionally and now they probably see her and act all sad if I am ever mentioned and play victim.

I want to fade her out as a friend. It disturbs me emotionally that I think she sides with them. I feel if I had an abusive boyfriend and left no one would feel the need to bring him up. Why do I not get believed that I was mistreated? Why are there some people that think someone would purposefully orphan themselves if a relationship wasn’t toxic?

I am also pissed because my dad has skin cancer and I know about it but she also had to bring them up too also. I told her I know and didn’t ask about it which also probably bothers her that I don’t care. because truthfully I do not make it my priority to care about the health of someone that previously abused and mistreated me emotionally when I wasn’t experienced enough to defend myself.

What also sucks is what people don’t realize is me going no contact actually has taken effort it’s not easy to do and maintain. If I were to go back the abuse would be the same if not worse. It’s not stubbornness it’s knowing they aren’t evolved enough to not mistreat me and I deserve better. And I feel like my thoughts are clouded for the past few months after getting coffee and feeling bad for my poor parents which I previously did not have pity for.

1h90898,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staunton/comments/1h90898/my_full_downtown_staunton_dining_guide_long_post/,My full downtown Staunton dining guide (long post!),"Here it is: the most comprehensive rating that exists of restaurants in Staunton, Virginia (I think)!

What this is: This is one person’s attempt at rating the full-service restaurants in downtown Staunton.  For this list, “downtown” roughly means the area between the train tracks, Coalter, Churchville, and Lewis.  I hope it’s useful for tourists and locals and for people with different tastes.  Your opinions are almost certainly different than mine, and that’s fine!

What this isn’t: 
This isn’t a list of the “best” places, just places that I like and recommend.  Everyone’s opinions can be different. 
It’s also not 100% comprehensive: I’m really just trying to make a list of places that I recommend.  If I think a place isn’t worth recommending, I’m not trying to interfere with someone’s livelihood and tell the world that their restaurant is bad.  There are probably also some places I just forgot about, and definitely some places I haven’t been to.  Feel free to ask if you want my view on a place that isn’t on the list.
It’s not every place you can get food or a drink in town.  I didn’t include places that are primarily for drinks and don’t have full menus (although Green Room, Ciders from Mars, and Redbeard are great!).  It’s not coffee shops (go to Crucible!) or bakeries (I love Reunion!).  It’s not the farmer’s market (but definitely get the apple cider donuts!).  None of those places fit within the rating system I’m going for.
It’s not places that are outside of downtown.  I love Ciro’s, Alex’s Tacos, and La Sabrosita in Waynesboro, White’s Wayside in Churchville is cool, the sandwich counter at the Cheese Shop in Stuarts Draft is an experience everyone should have, etc., etc.

How the ratings work:

★★★ (3 stars): My absolute favorites.  Tourists should put this on their list, and locals should have it in their “special occasion” rotation.  I think these places are succeeding in creativity and execution on food, the beverage program is notable, and service is top-notch. 

★★ (2 stars): Places I really like.  Probably good second choices for tourists, and places that locals will likely think of as “everyday favorites.”  Likely less expensive than the three star places, so really good options if you’re being budget-conscious.

★ (1 star): No complaints and they do what they do well, but they probably don’t stand out from lots of other places.  Locals should definitely have these in a regular rotation, but tourists should only seek them out if something is really calling their name about a particular place.

Here we go!

A class of their own, outside of the ratings system:

Maude and the Bear.  This is a true destination restaurant, verging into Inn at Little Washington territory.  The sort of place where people trying to go to the best restaurants on the east coast will make a special trip to Staunton just to experience.  If you can afford it and you think you’ll like the Jewish/Asian/Southern-fusion experience, put this at the top of your list.  For the budget-conscious, I highly recommend a cocktail and burger at the bar on Thursday evenings.

Three stars:

The Shack (★★★): Casual vibe with excellent pizza and pastas.  All of the food shows a real commitment to the craft.  Cool wine and cocktail list.  It all combines for a memorable experience.

The Chop House (★★★): Probably the least “original” of the three-star places, this is rated highly for perfect execution on their steakhouse concept.  Very classic feeling, despite being brand new.

Zynadoa (★★★): First-class sourcing - the place to go if you want to see Polyface and Autumn Olive on the menu.  Definitely fine-dining, but not fussy.

Two stars:

Blu Point (★★): Solid seafood, although they depend too much on the deep-fryer for my liking.  I recommend checking out the whole fish and catch of the day before the standard menu.

Queen City Bistro (★★): Don’t be fooled by the bland signage and decor, because the food is actually very good.  Way, way, way exceeds expectations.

Pizza Luca (★★): Impressive consistency, off-the-charts value, and don’t sleep on the sandwiches or salads.  The pizza is very good, but sometimes veers a little into “fast casual” territory with average toppings.  Bonus points for lively atmosphere, and probably the most kid-friendly place in town.

Taste of India (★★): Really excellent Indian food. The spice level is MUCH higher than you'd expect, and you get cool sides and sauces with everything. Service can be a little slow.

One star:

Mill Street Grill (★): I’ve never had the ribs, but people say they’re great.  Salads are massive and you get a free ice cream at the end of your meal.  Always busy.  Sort of a neat underground location.

The Depot Grill (★): The traditional long wooden bar with a great beer list is my favorite in town.  One of the most earnest restaurants you’ll go to: the prime rib with potato is literally just a slice of medium-rare beef with a baked potato, which is sort of refreshing.

Remedy Burger (★): Thought about not putting it on the list because the menu is so limited, thought about making it two stars because it’s very good at that limited menu, but put it here because the vegetarian option is weak. Along with Chicano Boy, maybe my favorite lunch spot in town.

Byers Street Bistro (★): Solid sandwiches and very good service.  It’s dependable, but not remarkable.

Gloria’s Pupuseria (★): The pupusas are very good.  Average margaritas.  Excellent salsas.  Nice for a change of pace from Mill Street/Depot/Byers Street, which all have similar menus to each other.

Chicano Boy (★): From the same owner/chef as Pizza Luca, and the consistency and value are again excellent.  I get a burrito from here almost weekly.  Like Remedy, a lunch highlight.

Wright’s Dairy-Rite (★): Yeah, yeah, technically outside of downtown.  The hot dog is the highlight of the menu.  It’s all about the vibe of ordering from a phone at your table and buying a t-shirt with their vintage logo.  Don’t miss the framed photo of Ollie North visiting the restaurant many decades ago.  Get a milkshake.

Marino’s Lunch (★): Also a few blocks outside of the downtown core, but a notable spot because of the very cool decor (note the Robin and Linda Williams tribute carved into the bar, for example) and solid bar food.  The real treat, though, is the bluegrass jam night on Tuesdays and Fridays, which I would rate as a ★★★ experience.  If you’re in town on a Tuesday, Marino’s is absolutely the place to go.

It wasn't always this way. She reads *constantly* but since I bought her a tablet years ago, she *only* reads digital books, so I can't buy her books anymore. There's no point in giving her a giftcard to buy digital books, because our money is shared, so, I'd just really be giving her something she already has.

Budget can be up to $150

She *used* to knit, she *used* to enjoy scrap-booking, she *used* to like to play Magic The Gathering and other card games, but these days she does only the following:

\- Binge TV shows in her favourite chair  
\- Play Pokemon Go when she is out  
\- Go to the movies (with me or alone), especially the drive-in  
\- Read books purchased digitally  
\- go out with her friends for lunch or dinner  
\- Drink coffee (already getting her some coffee pods)  
\- Build lego *occasionally* (she still hasn't built the lego I got her for her birthday back in Feb).

Upon arriving at the shopping centre where the market had been due to take place, the coach was greeted by the manager of the coach company, wearing a silly Christmas outfit, who handed out vouchers for free coffee (at a cafe he owns) and who - when asked whether the standard five hour stop was going to be shortened because the Christmas market was cancelled -  replied that the market hadn't been ""cancelled"", because the stalls had moved to the indoor market nearby. So I spent five hours sitting in the indoor market drinking coffee and reading, surrounded by tables full of crocheted tat and counting the minutes till the coach took me home.

It's starts off with a young woman who is a musician. She goes to visit her family in another state and I think they are from the Middle East, originally. The woman's father has a coffee shop.

There is another character, who is a man and he is in the military or he's a young veteran (not sure which) and he has a friend who is kind of an asshole. So the military guy ends up meeting the Middle Eastern girl. They start to fall in love, but the military guys idiot friend is kind of spying on them and stalking them and makes fun of the military guy for being with a Middle Eastern woman. 

Then the woman's father is hit by a car and military guy's idiot friend seems to be responsible, but it was actually his dad who hit the woman's father. The father dies and the woman takes over his coffee shop.

That's all I can remember, but it was such a good book that I would love to find it and read it again.

## 🔮🪬 There will still be SOME future leaked info going forward (V67.0+)

&#x200B;

• With this post I'm providing more details about transition steps for the future of game data leaks.  After Jan. 1st, there are 3 core broad tasks/functions that I do:

* Datamining for content posts on reddit
* Content posts in [the Facebook group where IceJD is an admin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/741864132620740/?ref=share)
* Posting emoji power videos on reddit in the DEB Emoji Power Video Library

🤩 Some of you may be familiar with ""Emoji Blitzer Gurl"" who has an array of video content on YouTube/Insta/TikTok.   She and I have been talking for many weeks and she is offering --- with some key limits/constraints! ---- to pick up the torch to data mine original content (some people in recent weeks have unfairly asserted she borrows my content, but she mines herself!).  **She will do the following of my main tasks as of V67.0's Beta**:

* 👷‍♀️⚒ datamining and producing images of *select* content, posting to both reddit *and* this Facebook group
* ‍🎥🎞 posting emoji power videos on reddit in the DEB Emoji Power Video Library

On reddit the handle will be /u/EmojiBlitzerGurl and in the FB group ""Deb Gurlie"" is the name

🧼📦 ***Keep in mind, like me, EmojiBlitzerGurl does NOT work for JC and is a VOLUNTEER***. Even with the changes I'm about to describe on what and when advance info will continue, there will be thousands of hours of unpaid labor EBG provides to the community.  Lobby JC directly if you want more transparency and content from their official resources!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## 🔮🪬 There will be BIG difference in what/how info is reported!

&#x200B;

🥲 As you breathe a collective sigh of relief, there will be many changes in what and how EmojiBlitzerGurl (EBG) produces content. ***While you can expect high-quality info and artwork from EBG on the content she produces, do NOT expect the exact level and breadth of all the content that I've produced for years to continue!  EBG will do truly ""key info"", and I've made ""cut"" recommendations for content that I've been producing that I believe should be retired from community expectations!*** This is not a complete list of things staying the same or changing!

🔄 *Things that will generally stay the same:*

* Posting new emoji images and insights on their release schedule
* Publishing an outline of the full event schedule when each Beta is released
* Creating graphic chart-like images for upcoming events, including token quests (but *when* they will be posted will be different....more on this below)
* Sharing content about Diamond Boxes and Gem-Based store boxes (but *when* they will be posted will be different....more on this below)
* The Lucky Gold Box schedule and contents (but maybe not fun theme names like I create!)
* Insights on new Emoji Upgrades/Stardust Prize Tracks

🔀 *Things that will be different:*

* ***All content for a major update will NOT be posted right after a Beta file drops!   Instead, anticipate a ""weekly"" cadence of future info.***  This will look like getting posts that provide the full details of the next 2-3 events and the next week's boxes; instead of \~7-8 weeks of full content all at once. This is a very important change, that I support for several reasons: a) the amount of time it takes to change and remake and repost info when JC changes things incessantly, b) it takes pressure of the dataminer to report everything *immediately*, and c) it will tamp down on the community animosity of changes that JC makes to content
* **All minor updates will not be reported extensively or immediately!**  Every little update between Betas (both seen and unseen) won't be reported in real time.  Instead, only changes that impact things EBG has already reported will be described.....again, with a roughly once per week cadence
* **Power Videos posted will be different**:  EBG does videos with all boosts on and pushes her scores to convey the potential an emoji has (like a master top 5% player might see) vs. my videos have prioritized showing the various nuances of powers and trying to convey the score potential of a player in the top 20-25% of players (using fewer boosts).
* **Do** **NOT** **expect EBG to do ""extra"" things that I've done, like**: recommendations on token quest purchases, Lucky Gold Box priority recommendations, reminders to collect token prizes at the end of a quest, etc.
* Posts like: New Emoji 101/Level to Level, emojis power trigger data, etc., are unlikely to continue

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## ✅❎ My recommendations to EBG for content to ""retire"" from production includes:

&#x200B;

* Sales (Cascade, Gumball, Specific Emoji, Holiday flash sales!);   This one *really* takes up a lot of time, regularly has info change in updates, and, IMO that vast majority of it is so expensive that the average player just isn't spending what JC is asking.   The time to make all this *really* shouldn't be expected of a *volunteer* dataminer......JC should prioritize their PAID staff promoting this if they want, instead of a VOLUNTEER doing this
* Giveaway details (the prizes are lackluster mostly anyway)
* Fairy Minnie's daily login prize schedule (the prizes are mostly lackluster anyway)
* Stardust Challenge Constellation Prize schedule
* New artwork collages for things like new box artwork, wheel designs, etc. (But I do suspect EBG will post ""non-playable emoji"" artwork each cycle!)
* **I've also encouraged EBG to avoid the temptation of heavily engaging in Q&A on the forums**.  I think there are many in both forums who will pick up the mantel on redirecting people with hyperlinks to posted content, and I've encouraged her to focus more on making content

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## 🧑‍🏫📖 Future Content and Moderation of the FB Group

&#x200B;

* While ""DEB Gurlie"" will post information in  [the Facebook group where IceJD is an admin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/741864132620740/?ref=share), like her other forums, she does not plan or have the capacity to ""actively manage"" the FB Group.
* The breadth of additional posts I've provided, helping centralize and provide PSA for game issues, recommendations, etc., as well as answer questions, directing traffic to content, updating the pinned posts in the featured section, etc. are all areas that **I'm still assessing transition options for assisting with**  [the Facebook group where IceJD is an admin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/741864132620740/?ref=share)**.**
* As we get closer to the end of the month, I'll do another update on this transition.  **Please know that I do anticipate the group will remain active, with new content from EBG, and moderated!  Stay Tuned!**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

# Finally, a reminder on a ☕Thank You Opportunity ☕

* [**https://www.buymeacoffee.com/icejd**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/icejd)

I've been putting this at the end of my retirement announcement posts to take a moment to say I've really been humbled and appreciative of the community coffee donations since I made this virtual tip jar (at some of your suggesting!) in January. Your thanks is *much appreciated* and, for the record, my coffee budget is quite large and the overall thanks received hasn't exceeded my annual coffee expenses. So it really can all be attributed to actual coffee!

I need a little but of help here interpreting this person. 

I'm a girl in her later twenties in college and theres this guy I fancy but he seems to be an introvert. At social gatherings he's always on the edge of the people circle and I rarely see him approach people/ be very loud or outgoing. 


For the past six months we've had this back and forth where we slowly kind of... talked to each other? 


Until now it's like this:

Gone out for a 1:1 coffee (albeit short because his schedule is packed) 

He's offered to help me with my thesis and chat about a topic of common interest 

He kinda blushed? And stopped to smalltalk with me, when he saw me in the hallway after I had attended a non mandatory project from his faculty 

He's said hello to me at parties even when I was just passing by and he was engaged with other people. 

I noticed him looking at me as I exit or enter shared spaces... 


The issue is he's not really... asked to do stuff one on one or come forwards to be like: hey wanna go for a walk or coffee again? 

Idk if he's interested or stringing me along or if I'm just misinterpreting his kindness... :') 

Idk if I should just make a move and if how? 
By telling him I have a crush or just keep engaging with him...

The receptionist then charged me for broken brackets that the dentist had done for free the month before. Usually you pay but she didn't charge because of the flirtiness. She changed her mind and decided to charge me after I ""accidentally rejected"" her and she went cold.

1h8zrx5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8zrx5,Fosters going back and gift for shelter staff?,"I’m bringing my foster kittens and their mom back to the humane society on Monday morning to be dropped off for their surgeries and then they’ll go out to their adopters.

I’m feeling sad and guilty since kittens will only be 7 weeks old but the humane society was pretty insistent about taking them back and getting them out (they were ready to take them this past Wednesday, but I got a bit more time).

I’m annoyed at the humane society’s policy on this (i guess as long as the kittens are doing well and at least 700 grams, they are ready to get them out the door).

I’m trying to set that aside though since there’s not much I can beyond the discussions I’ve already had with them.

I also like the staff there (even if not their policies) and assume the staff I’m interacting with doesn’t have much say. I thought it would be nice to give them a little gift and card and was wondering if anyone has thoughts? 

I was kinda just thinking I could do a card and gift card to a nearby coffee shop chain (Dunkin donuts type….it’s not the nicest but it’s close to the shelter and the gift card would go further). 

Thanks!

This is the stuff I listen to while watching Minecraft speed runs and it actually happened to me. 

My bf (m 26) and I (f 22) have been together now for 4 years. We have had an amazing relationship with a lot of trust and transparency. He my best friend and I truly have never been happier and we can’t imagine our lives without each other. This morning we signed and submitted a lease agreement for our first real home- and apartment. I drafted and sent the email with the files, but as I was closing out his email I noticed an email at the bottom of the page from OF. Of course he was getting coffee upstairs so I opened it and saw it was a notification for a subscription of his expiring. 

He is the most amazing guy. I knew he watched porn casually when we won’t see each other for days or a week at a time and we have even watched it together on one occasion. But I thought it was on porn sites without an account- seeing him have a subscription to a specific creator and to be on OF was completely new to me and honestly shocking. He explained to me that he is subscribed to a few people but that they’re free and he doesn’t pay money. I asked to see his subscriptions to know for sure that he isn’t spending money. 

But. He didn’t ever give me his phone to look through it. I don’t know if he’s chatting with people. I didn’t even see everyone he’s subscribed to. I’m just so sad and disappointed that he never told me. I thought our relationship was more trusting and healthier than this. 

I was really nice about it. I never raised my voice or accused him of cheating or anything. I just explained to him that I want to see his account to know for sure that he’s telling the truth. I’ve known for years that he’s watched porn and I think it’s normal. I just wished I would have known so it didn’t feel so secretive. I don’t love that he watches it- I want to be his sole source of that kind of pleasure. It makes me feel like I’m not enough. 

Anyway. Right now I’m back at my house and have every intention of pretty much ignoring him until he reaches out. I also feel like he owes me a huge apology for all this. I love him and I know that to a degree what he did is normal behavior for a 26 year old heterosexual guy but that doesn’t make me feel any better.

For my K-Cups I use one K-Cup per mug and if I need more coffee than the system would allow I would just pour in more water into it in the middle of its brewing cycle.

1h8zpnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1h8zpnl/venting_about_coworkers/,Venting about coworkers,"First time poster here.

After slugging it out all week at the job site (I’m a working foreman) between running the trades and guys under me and being on the tools, I get a call from the office on Friday around noon to come in on the way home from work.

I get there and the boss sits me down, hands me a scotch (we do that kinda thing regularly) and start to chuckle a little. I’m wondering, where the hell is this going. He then informs me that out of the company (less then a dozen) I’ve “had a couple of complaints about me” recently.  Now I’ve been a working foreman for a few years, been pretty much the game group of guys, expect for these two new ones.

There are also 2 other guys in my position, who are on the tools and run the sites as well. We three get along great, there is no ego and we each give 110 percent when we are on each other’s sites. The rest seem to give enough to warrant their paycheque, but that said, us 3 main guys are always reeling those others to either:
“get off the phone”
“time to lean, time to clean”
Or
“Don’t know what to do, ask.”

We try to keep it fun on the site, but there is a time to work, so let’s get the job done.

Back in the office, my boss (also owner) says that the complaints are “I’m too hard on the guys”.
So what does that mean? Who knew that telling people who want to be paid for 8 hours need to work for 8 hours is a mean thing. That telling people that coffee break is over, put the phone away.

Long story short, he laughed and said I’m don g a good job. When I’m running the site, I’m not their friend, I’m to have the bosses interest first.

I tried to buy from this Facebook group, which looked legitimate but turned out to be an UTTER SCAM.

This is a public group with 1.8k members claiming to sell mostly used La Marzocco espresso machines and Niche Zero grinders. 99% of the time the admin is the seller. Most of her posts start off like this: ""Available! Available! Available!@ affordable price. Comes with complete accessories.!"" which then are changed to ""Sold! Sold! Sold!"" fairly quickly, giving the impression that people are actually buying from admin. There are a couple of apparently genuine-LOOKING ""reviews"" about machines bought off this site. In short, I thought the group LOOKED legit.

I bought a used NZ on Nov 24 (Sunday) based on firm assurance from admin/seller that it would be shipped the following Tuesday, Nov 26. I paid $330 + half of the shipping cost, being $45 = $375 in total.

By Dec 6 (Friday) i.e. after two full working weeks, the grinder had NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED. NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER has been given to me about this failure despite MULTIPLE ENQUIRIES on my part.

After MANY attempts at trying to get an update about what is going on, it turns out (according to the admin anyway) the admin is NOT even the seller. She is just a middle party with NO CONTROL over the actual shipping of the product I have paid for. This was not indicated in any way in any of her posts. In hindsight, it is all part of an elaborate scam, so none of this might even be true.

The admin also assured me on multiple occasions that I will receive a refund if nothing ever gets sent out. She has FAILED to provide a refund and is now UNRESPONSIVE. I am now out of pocket by $375 and no grinder in sight.

I have reported this group and the admin to Facebook and to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.

The admin has also very conveniently blocked me from this group - in fact, she did this very early on, when the grinder didn't get shipped on Nov 26. No doubt she knew from the beginning that I would receive nothing for my money. Since then I created another fb account in an attempt to post on the group about my experience of buying from it and found out that you can only post on the group IF ADMIN APPROVES THE POST. Meaning that admin can vet anything that gets posted on it. Which is probably why 99% of the posts are written by her and her fraudulent friends posting ""reviews"" of their machines ""bought"" from her.

I would warn anyone not to be as stupid as I have been in buying something they haven't seen from Facebook. I am so upset since NZ is expensive and I just wanted to get a reasonably priced used product. I ended up wasting money and will not be able to get a new grinder for a very long time now.

This is what the group looks like now. I am aware that the admin has changed the name of the group a couple of times, but usually the words ""used coffee/espresso machine"" are part of the group name, so watch out for name changes too.

=====================================================

Bad breath, or halitosis, can be a rather distressing condition. It’s one of those things that can sneak up on you and push you into a corner, leaving you feeling self-conscious and anxious about your conversations. The quest for fresh breath is a universal journey that many embark upon. And let me tell you, I recently discovered that zinc might just hold the key to unlocking a brighter smile and fresher breath! In this article, I’ll share my personal story of how I battled bad breath and found solace in zinc. So grab a comfy seat, and let’s delve into this fascinating remedy.

The Origins of My Oral Woes: Where Bad Breath Begins
----------------------------------------------------

Bad breath isn’t just caused by what you ate for lunch. It can stem from a multitude of sources, and I was about to learn all about them. For me, it started innocently enough. A few late-night snacks, an occasional coffee fix, and before I knew it, I was dodging close-up conversations.

### What Causes Bad Breath?

It’s easy to point fingers at garlic or onions, but the truth is there’s a laundry list of culprits behind bad breath:

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: Not brushing and flossing regularly leads to food particles lingering in your mouth, creating a perfect playground for bacteria.
2. **Dry Mouth**: Saliva plays a major role in maintaining oral health. When your mouth is dry, it allows bacteria to thrive.
3. **Diet**: Certain foods can cause bad odors. Think fish, garlic, and spicy dishes.
4. **Medical Conditions**: Sometimes, underlying health issues like sinus infections, diabetes, or gastrointestinal problems can manifest themselves through unpleasant breath.
5. **Tobacco Products**: Smoking can lead to a host of oral health issues and certainly doesn’t help with fresh breath.

Each of these factors made me pause and reflect on my habits. Could it really be that simple? I decided it was time to make some changes and find a solution that would work.

The Zinc Revelation: My Turning Point
-------------------------------------

It wasn't until a trusted friend casually mentioned zinc during one of our chats that I started to consider it as a potential remedy. “Zinc?” I wondered. ""Could it really do the trick?"" That little nugget of information sent me spiraling down the rabbit hole of research. What I found was astonishing!

### What Is Zinc and Why Should You Care?

Zinc is a trace mineral that our bodies require for numerous vital processes. It’s known for its immune-boosting properties, but its benefits extend far beyond that. In the realm of oral health, zinc is renowned for several reasons:

- **Antibacterial Properties**: It helps combat the bacteria that are often responsible for bad breath.
- **Saliva Production**: Zinc aids in maintaining healthy saliva levels, which is crucial for keeping your mouth clean and fresh.
- **Taste and Smell**: A deficiency in zinc can affect your taste and smell perception, potentially leading to unwanted odors.

My interest was piqued. If zinc could tackle a few of these issues head-on, then I was sign me up!

My Experiment with Zinc: How I Incorporated It Into My Routine
--------------------------------------------------------------

After doing my homework, I decided to incorporate zinc into my daily routine. Here's how I went about it:

### Step 1: Choosing the Right Zinc Supplement

Not all zinc supplements are created equal. I had to sift through options to find the right fit. Some of the types I considered included:

- **Zinc Gluconate**: Easy to absorb and gentle on the stomach.
- **Zinc Citrate**: Known for high bioavailability.
- **Zinc Picolinate**: More effective for some people due to better absorption.

Ultimately, I chose zinc gluconate, noting that it was popular among consumers and seemed to have fewer side effects.

### Step 2: Establishing a Routine

Now, taking a supplement wasn’t enough on its own. I had to integrate it seamlessly into my daily life. Here’s what my routine looked like:

- **Morning Ritual**: I’d take my zinc tablet right after breakfast to kickstart my day.
- **Hydration is Key**: I made sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day—keeping my mouth moist and my system refreshed.
- **Oral Hygiene**: I stepped up my oral hygiene game by brushing twice a day and adding a quality mouthwash—one that also contained zinc.

### Step 3: Patience and Persistence

Like most remedies, it took a bit of time before I noticed any changes. After about two weeks, though, something incredible happened!

Discovering Fresh Breath: The Transformation
--------------------------------------------

The turnaround was almost magical. I could feel a shift in my confidence and overall comfort. Conversations felt less daunting, and I began to shed the anxiety that had enveloped me for months.

### Signs That Zinc Was Working

- **Reduction in Dry Mouth**: No more waking up with that cottonmouth feeling!
- **Less Bad Breath**: Friends and family even commented on my refreshing breath. Talk about music to my ears!
- **Improved Oral Health**: Regular check-ups showed my gum health was on the rise, and my dentist was impressed.

### The Science Behind the Change

Curious minds may wonder how exactly zinc worked its magic. Research indicates that zinc ions can inhibit the growth of bacteria responsible for bad breath. This means fewer foul-smelling compounds produced in the mouth. Additionally, by enhancing saliva production, zinc contributes to a natural cleaning effect, keeping the mouth fresher for longer.

Zinc Cured My Bad Breath: Spreading the Word
--------------------------------------------

I couldn’t keep my experience to myself! If zinc had helped me, I felt it was only fair to share my newfound treasure with others grappling with the same issue.

### Talking Openly About Oral Health

Opening the door for discussions about oral hygiene and bad breath was liberating. I found that many people were hesitant to talk about their struggles. To address this, I made it a point to:

- **Educate Others**: I shared articles, studies, and even my own experiences to create awareness.
- **Encourage Questions**: Creating a safe space for anyone to ask questions without judgment.
- **Promote Oral Health Routines**: Encouraging friends and family to adopt healthy oral care habits, including regular dental visits.

Beyond Zinc: Additional Support for Fresh Breath
------------------------------------------------

While zinc was a significant player in my battle against bad breath, there were other strategies I implemented to fortify my oral health.

### Maintaining Overall Oral Hygiene

Here are the additional steps that complemented my zinc regimen:

1. **Regular Brushing and Flossing**: Sticking to a consistent routine is a must! Aim for at least two minutes of brushing twice a day.
2. **Eating Fresh Foods**: Crunchy fruits and vegetables can help clean your teeth naturally. Apples and carrots, anyone?
3. **Staying Hydrated**: Always have water on hand to rinse away food particles and keep your mouth moist.
4. **Chewing Sugar-Free Gum**: This can stimulate saliva production and freshen breath on-the-go.

### Exploring Other Natural Remedies

While zinc proved effective, I also dove into other natural remedies worth considering:

- **Green Tea**: The polyphenols in green tea can inhibit bacteria and promote fresh breath.
- **Parsley**: A natural breath freshener; chewing on this herb can reduce odors.
- **Baking Soda**: A natural deodorizer, using baking soda as a toothpaste can neutralize odors.

The Long Game: Sustaining Freshness
-----------------------------------

So, here I am now, happily sharing my experience about how “zinc cured my bad breath.” But it’s important to stress that sustaining freshness is a long-term commitment. Here’s how I plan to keep my breath smelling sweet:

### Continuous Education

I’m committed to staying well-informed about oral health, knowing that new information and discoveries are always on the horizon.

### Regular Dental Visits

Keeping up with my twice-a-year dental appointments ensures that I maintain optimal oral health and can catch any issues early.

### Staying Mindful of My Diet

Being conscious of what I eat will help in managing any potential odor triggers.

Crashed on my dad 4 months after he got it, I have spent the last three days reviving it for a replacement home computer after my laptop died in a coffee spill courtesy of my teen daughter. 

I came to the conclusion corrupted windows files were the cause of the crash I couldn’t do a windows repair couldn’t perform a new install (Bios/UEFI was being uncooperative also I’m not very familiar with that system), so I booted it with a mint cinnamon boot USB I got off a buddy(first time interacting with Linux was intriguing) I wiped the hard drive. Installed the Intel optane M.2 500Gb SSD out of my laptop into the machine(somehow survived the coffee) to make it a little more smooth running installed windows 10 via ISO boot USB last night, ran great, shut down restart no issues, started fresh downloads for installs of my primary programs I use for work went to bed. 

this morning I have a blank screen of nothingness it’s not the monitor or the cable I used an Xbox and wife’s work laptop to check both are fully functional. Monitor says no signal found from the 590. 

Pulled the hard drives, reset memory and CMOS battery and tried it again still no signal. Checked HP forums tried the Win. + B or V boot starts still nothing. I read I could possibly download updated BIOS software, and try that. I guess it could be could be the video card just seems unlikely to me at this point. 

Before I continue fighting to get this thing working did I miss anything?

But her recent comments about wanting to capture her party hosting in a coffee table book for Pinterest-style inspiration? That felt a little off. 

She mentioned wanting to host NYE this year, but it’s only because she wants all the sparkly clothes and edible glitter drinks. Nothing about connecting with others or making people feel special. It sounded more like an excuse to create an Instagramable moment.

Then she went on about how she wishes she had professionally photographed all her past parties because now “at this point, I feel like I have two years of good work lost.” LOST!. Why? Because she couldn’t show it off in a book?

And let’s not skip over the part where she caught herself saying her parties were “elaborate” but quickly pivoted to calling them “intentional.” Sorry, but those two things don’t align. Wanting everything to look “Pinterest-perfect” and over-the-top with themed decorations, crafts, and edible glitter is the opposite of simple intentionality.

To me, it feels like she’s using this so-called core value as a convenient excuse for content and to spend exorbitant amounts of money, all while justifying what looks like a shopping addiction. How many decorations, supplies, and unnecessary items are really about the community versus fulfilling her own desire to buy more stuff to hide how depressed she is or to try and buy others’ admiration and approval? 

If her goal was really to “bless her community,” why would she care so much about polished, professional photos or turning her parties into a product? Isn’t the point supposed to be the people and the memories, not how Pinterest-perfect the setup looks or how much money she spends?

It’s all screams external validation wrapped up in a pretty, party-themed bow. What do y’all think?


PS. the phrase “bless my community” feels…weird. It comes across as if she sees herself as some kind of savior, as though no one could possibly host a decent party without her swooping in to plan parties for people who apparently could not manage without her. Ugh she’s so full of herself. ",13,1733597951.0,micheljanseYT,4,1.0,False

In the air of excitement of getting this player in the mail a day early, I pilfered the HDMI 2.1 cable that came with my PS5 and used it to connect the 820. 

Made sure that Firmware was updated. Didn't make any other adjustments other than enabling Dolby Vision. 

So to test a native Dolby Vision disc, I popped in Back to the Future part 1. The brief on screen display that shows its a 4K disc and the audio format of DTS:HD and the telltale display at the top across the screen is ""DOLBY VISION"".

Finally I can enjoy Dolby Vision from my discs, instead of being limited to using my TV's native streaming apps for enjoying DV. 

I've been using my PS5 as my disc player since I got the PS5, thinking that I'd never really tell the difference between normal HDR and DV. That it until I got my a TV that supports Dolby Vision and used the Netflix app native on the TV and noticed the DV marking on some of the movies. 

While I know that streaming is an inferior quality to physical media, and always will be until network infrastructure improves to the point where these streaming companies will have no problem sending us 50-150Mbps bitrate video to us (yes I'm aware that bitrate is only part of the story with image quality when one also has to consider the actual encoding format used).... You can still tell a difference between standard HDR and Dolby Vision even streaming. The highlights on bright objects, like the sun on a horizon, or the eye-searing cone of light from a flashlight in a dark room as you follow an investigator scoping out a crime scene, or perhaps the nice glitter-dance of the metal flake on the paint job of a car in a Fast & Furious movie.... you can tell. 



----------------------------------

Story Time


(TL;DR) I found myself a bad batch of Rocketfish HDMI 2.1 cables from Best Buy that gave me bit of a jump start in my hear thinking that I had busted player, and I think that every device should include an HDMI cable that meets the spec it was built for. 


Now gather round everyone, time for a little story (Copy & Paste into your favorite AI program with your voice of choice for a little audiobook, like say Morgan Freeman or maybe Michael Cain... or David Attenborough) 


The biggest problem with the UB820, is clearly the most obvious from anyone who has gotten one from this recent sale when was priced to $350 this Thanksgiving holiday...NO HDMI CABLE IS INCLUDED. Like honestly, HDMI cables are so cheap, it should be mandatory to have at least ONE included on every device you buy; either a new TV or a player of sorts so that you can immediately turn it on and enjoy your new gadget. We shouldn't be forced to have to run a simple errand to drive to a store to buy such a cable. 

Which is where I lay with my current issue. 

(THIS IS NOT A KNOCK ON THE PLAYER. IT IS 100% FANTASTIC FOR WHAT WE ALL WANT/NEED IT TO DO - PLAY 4K DISCS AND ENJOY DOLBY VISION)


HDMI Cables:

I've never personally had an issue with any HDMI cable in the past, but once in while I see someone online have an issue that was resolved by using a different cable. It's now happened to me. 

After enjoying BTTF 1 on the first play, I finally had time to go buy a new HDMI cable. I'm okay with spending a price premium for the convenience of just driving out to a store, rather than waiting a day or two to get one shipped. Best Buy not far away, so I buy a short 4ft cable of the Rocketfish brand. I grumbled a little at the $40 price but its whatever. Just needed a certified HDMI 2.1 cable and it'll be something I'll use for many years. 

Later on that night, to watch BTTF Part 2, when I pressed ""play"" in the BTTF movie, it was initially as expected: bright highlights, accurate colors and all the good things that come from Dolby Vision on an OLED TV like it did almost 12 hours earlier. 

But I started noticing something peculiar, I noticed a bunch of little white dots randomly going around the screen... On first 10minutes, I thought this was part of the film they scanned. As if they didn't properly clean the film before scanning or it was just film damage they couldn't/didn't fix at whomever did the production for these discs. It just looked a little dirty. I kept watching, and about 15minutes into the movie the screen goes black and all audio is gone but comes back after about 3 seconds. 

I keep watching the movie to its entirety, all the while those white dots keep dancing around.... its not A LOT, just a few random dots all over the place. And the signal dropped again about another 15-20minutes in the movie and does so again at the climax of the movie. 

Initially I thought ""oh man, I got a bad disc/player/cable""

So to troubleshoot to rule out my TV and the player or disc, I immediately go straight into changing the disc back to BTTF Part 1 for a few minutes and I notice the dots immediately, and the signal does drop but not at the same spot. So it wasn't my discs. I notice it even more when I press ""stop"" on the remote and it goes to a standby screen for the player thats all black but shows ""Ultra HD Blu-Ray"" logo. So I REALLY notice it. As I said before, its a handful of pixels randomly showing white. 

Here's a clip I made showing it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5kcfdyjl0Q






So to rule out the player itself and my TV, I next tried the same BTTF 1 disc - but used 2 different HDMI cables on the same HDMI port. 1 was the same PS5 cable I pilfered, and the other was the same Rocketfish brand cable I bought several months ago when I got my Sony A95L, just a bit longer length at 10ft. 

The dots were gone and I was able to watch the movie all the way through with no signal drop out. 

So over the course of 12ish hours, I had watched BTTF Part1, 4 times. Its one of my favorite movies of all time, at one point I had the dialog of the entire trilogy memorized. I still have my original VHS copy locked away in a tote sitting in the attic - there isn't a modern VHS player that can run it now, I literally wore the tape out to the point that its constantly having tracking issues. 

Enough of the tangent, back to the cable. 

Frustrated that I have to run back to Best Buy to exchange the cable, I call it a night and watch M539 Restoration's latest video on his V12 BMW restoration till I fall asleep. 

Wake up the next morning, have my coffee, take my dogs out for their morning zoomies and poopies in the backyard. 

Toss on a hoodie and a hat and make my trip to Best Buy to make an exchange. Its quick and easy. I grab the same brand and length cable I wanted to exchange it to, take it the checkout and do a swap and I tell them whats wrong with it since they asked. Don't worry, I kept it short and sweet, despite this little novella: ""Signal keeps dropping out and I get all these weird dots when the signal doesn't drop out""

I get home, bust out the new cable, plug it in...... ITS FUCKING WORSE!!!. Now there are way more white dots dancing around the screen. I pop in BTTF 1 disc back in, and the signal drops every few seconds while on the main menu. 

Here's a clip of the increased amount of dots:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lcv8QulrEA



To make absolutely sure I wasn't going crazy, I go through another round of troubleshooting: tried the same 2 HDMI cables I used the night before: Absolutely perfect image. 

It seems I won the negative lottery on bad HDMI cables and I may have just found an actual bad batch from Rocketfish. 

And thus, I have to go to Best Buy for a 3rd time.... So far I'm 0-2. Maybe this time I'll spend a few more bucks on a longer cable.

New faces, new spaces, new energy—it’s thrilling and nerve-wracking at the same time. I had been working from home since I joined this company, so while the work itself wasn’t new, meeting the team in person was.

Naina had been my only contact so far, and from our conversations, I already liked her. She had this calm, thoughtful vibe about her. She told me good things about the team, about how close-knit they were. But there was also this slight hesitation in her tone, like she wasn’t sure how I’d fit in. I wasn’t worried, though. I’d figure it out. I always do.

Walking into the office that day felt like stepping onto a stage, and I loved it. The familiar faces of my college friends in the cafeteria waved at me from afar, but this moment wasn’t about them. It was about this new team. My team.

I spotted Allie first. She was cheerful, almost maternal, and introduced me to everyone with the kind of warmth that makes you feel instantly at home. As we settled down to discuss my responsibilities, I realized how organized and patient she was—a natural mentor. I could see why the team respected her, and why they might miss her when she left.

Naina joined us later, and her quiet, reserved energy contrasted with Allie’s outgoing nature. I noticed her hanging back during introductions, like she was waiting for someone to pull her into the circle. It didn’t take long for me to decide that someone would be me. I made a point of sitting beside her during our first coffee break and asking her about herself.

It started small—her favorite coffee, the kind of music she liked—but soon we were swapping memes and joking about the chaos of our work. Within days, we were walking to the cafeteria together, sharing snacks, and giggling like old friends. I introduced her to the rest of the team properly, and I could see her start to relax.

Andy, though, was a different story. From the moment I met him, it was like we’d known each other forever. He was charming, funny, and had this way of making you feel like the most interesting person in the room. We clicked immediately, trading playful banter and teaming up to tease the others during lunch. He called me his ""partner-in-crime,"" and I happily leaned into the role.

David was there too, of course. He was polite, reserved, and slightly awkward in a way that made him stand out. While Andy filled the room with his energy, David seemed content to sit back and observe. I couldn’t quite figure him out, but something about his quiet presence made me curious.

The days blurred into a rhythm—daily stand-ups, long tea breaks, shared lunches, and endless discussions about work, movies, and everything in between. I thrived on it all. Being around people, connecting with them, weaving myself into the fabric of the team—it was what I did best.

One day, during a particularly chaotic lunch hour, I noticed Naina sitting off to the side, staring at her phone. Without thinking, I walked over and plopped down beside her.

“What’s so interesting?” I asked, peering at her screen.

She smiled faintly. “Just catching up on some messages.”

I nudged her playfully. “Come on, you’re missing all the fun. The team is counting how many times the scrum master would say ""Ok, but what is the estimate"". Trust me, it’s something you don’t want to miss. Once Victor said ""this feature is not possible"", and the scrum master said, ""Ok, victor but what is the estimate"". Trust me, that dude literally only knows these words”

She laughed—a real, genuine laugh—and I felt a spark of satisfaction. Slowly but surely, Naina was opening up, and I couldn’t help but feel proud of myself for being the one to make it happen.

As the weeks went by, I found myself fully immersed in this little world we’d created. Allie’s training was thorough, and I picked up my responsibilities quickly. The team welcomed me with open arms, and I thrived on the camaraderie. Even when we weren’t working, we were sharing jokes, planning outings, and just enjoying each other’s company.

And then there was David.

He wasn’t like Andy, who could light up a room with a single comment, or like Victor, who had this natural authority about him. David was… different. Quiet. Thoughtful. And maybe, just maybe, a little intriguing.

But that’s a story for another time.

By the end of my first month with the team, I felt like I belonged. It wasn’t just about the work or the routines—it was about the people. Andy, with his larger-than-life energy. Naina, with her slowly blossoming warmth. Allie, with her guidance. And David, with his quiet presence. Well, Allie is about to leave.

She'll use my desire for sex as a tool for her to get things.  ""If you make me a cup of coffee that would reeeeeeeally be nice 😉"" , so I'll do favors like this.  Massage her.  Scratch her back.  Clean house.  Everything.  

Then the sun starts to set, and she showers,  and I'm thinking,  she's getting ready for me.  

Then she takes contacts out.  Pajamas on. And the eventual ""I'm too sleepy"" and if I don't drop it right there,  she'll create a reason on how it's actually my fault and to stop asking. 

And every time I'm soooo upset with myself because I've tricked myself into thinking she's finally coming around and she'll go to wanting sex like I do.  But the results are always the same. 


I just want to cry

Edit: changed flair to support only,  no advice

I'm close to a decade into being with a terrible sex partner.  I know I'm not in the wrong for my desires, and me constantly being proactive isn't an issue.

I really only want you to obey one law in particular, and it's this --- (drumroll) Don't have sex... unless you get married. And if you do get married, make sure it's to someone of the opposite gender! And the more babies you can make, the better. That is the greatest commandment. Other than that, remember to pay your tithes and to show up on my doorstep once a week to sing my praises. And when I serve you tea and coffee, that's when you must leave. Do this, and we're cool.""

These practical needs (which include food, water, shelter, transportation, clothing, etc) all require money to secure. The distinguished brotherhood on this sub knows better than to idolize money but at the same time, we all know money is necessary for a good life in our modern world (circa 2024).

Given that money is required to live a decent life and provide for those we love in our current society, it  would stand all of us in good stead to secure enough of it. Many of us understood this growing up and as a result, completely bought into the ""go to school to get a degree to a get a high paying job"" paradigm. Now although there is nothing wrong with working a 9-5 to earn money as I did for many years, there was something terribly inefficient about the way I tried to go about making my money.

Working a 9-5 job as a coomer was an absolute drag. I was perpetually low on energy with terrible brain fog, and a side of dreadful anxiety. The women I worked with seemed to be constantly scheming up ways to set me up for failure. As you can imagine, making a living with all these forces working against me was difficult to near impossible. This unfortunate cycle that I found myself in plunged me further and further into a victim mentality which actually made everything much worse. I was eventually  thoroughly convinced that the problems I was facing were due to external forces unfairly acting on me. Little did I know that my personal financial hell actually started with the man in the mirror.

My personal financial hell was unremitting and culminated in a firing from hellish job that although paid well, was seriously depleting my soul and health. Although getting fired at the time was painful, it ended up being one of the best things that ever happened to me. For the first time in a long time, I stopped blaming everyone around me and used this time for deep introspection. Early one gray Sunday morning, I found a video on semen retention while absentmindedly browsing YouTube. The concept sounded a little ridiculous to me but I was at such a low point that I was ready to try anything. I plunged and committed to SR in hopes it would make a difference. 

  
During the first month of SR, a bunch of strange things started happening. At first, I started getting little free things like a cup of coffee or pastry from the local coffee shop. As the weeks rolled along, this escalated into being given a super luxe german car to drive for free, and many other perks I can't possibly recount here. I also started to get lucrative job offers from multiple sources which helped improve my financial situation immensely. I found that the women at my work places liked and respected me a lot so I stopped having to worry about crafty set up games and office politics. It is almost as if they just knew ""ok... we can't really mess with this one, so let's just be nice to him"". Cleaning up my filthy sexual habits made me sharper, more intuitive, more motivated, and more productive which led to quicker strides along my career path and better pay. These experiences taught me that we humans are fundamentally sexual beings, and if we abuse that fundamental part of ourselves, it stands to reason that everything else will tend to go wrong... including your finances and social life.  Following the practice of Semen Retention and masculine purity had helped me improve my financial standing in life to a significant degree and it will do the same for you as you commit to your journey and follow it no matter what.

Greetings from the land of corn 🌽🌽🌽 


I'm a 30-year-old non-binary person looking for a kind, caring, dependable partner. I'm interested in building something that could potentially be long-term, as I believe the best relationships grow over time together. I'm seeking a genuine connection and someone willing to put in the effort to nurture it.


About me:


- I lean towards androgynous/masculine presentation with an alt/lazy goth style, am pretty tall at 5'11"" (6' in my Docs 😌), have a slightly curvy figure, very short blondish hair, blue/green eyes, and wear glasses. I have tattoos, stretched earlobes (just 1/2""), and I'm always planning my next ink.


-I prefer to use they/them pronouns but I get called everything on any given day without it bothering me too much 😂 


- I highly suspect I am autistic but haven't received a medical diagnosis. I do struggle with getting overstimulated and have some sensory issues. I identify as demisexual and sapphic, and I deal with anxiety/depression. I appreciate a partner who is understanding and patient, especially on tough days. Some days are easier than others, so having someone who gets that or shares it themselves would be ideal (if you know what the spoon theory is, huge bonus points!). Let's support each other through our rough patches!



- I'm politically liberal/dem leaning and would prefer a partner who shares similar values.


-I am into kink (sub) and would strongly prefer my partner to have some experience or interest in it as well (still looking for my dream Domme lol). You can find another post about my likes/hard limits on my profile to see if our tastes match.


I like to think I have a good sense of humor, enjoy working with my hands, reading, writing my own stories, and enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea while knitting (I'm quite crafty, let me shower you in knitted presents!). I adore my gardens in the spring and summer, being outdoors when the weather's nice, riding my motorcycle (when the weather cooperates lol), cooking, occasionally baking, and listening to random podcasts (especially true crime). I'm currently learning a second language, enjoy walking and hiking with my great dane, creating things for my cats (ask me about my literal cat tree!), and doing volunteer work. Despite life's current challenges, I'm trying to be a kind person and find some amount of happiness in everyday moments. (My secret to getting through all this shit right now? Spite! 😂) I'm also child free by choice due to genetic reasons.


I tend to info dump and can go off on tangents, but I enjoy deep conversations and learning new things. I'm ok with small talk and appreciate genuine interactions. Deeper discussions are more my style, but I'd also love to listen to how your day went and all the little stuff you're doing (I'm a great listener/cheerleader 😊) and send each other silly gifs/memes. 


Deal breakers:


- Communication is key for me. We're all adults, and I understand life gets busy. However, lack of communication is a major trust/deal-breaker for me (right up there with crossing hard limits). I like sending my partner little messages like a ""good morning"" and receiving a response, ensuring we're both present. I don't like feeling like the only one who's putting in the effort to initiate conversation or carry it by myself. If things aren't working out or the spark fades, I prefer open dialogue in ending things over being ghosted. I struggle with partners who go silent for days, and would not do well with one.


- If you're not a fan of dogs/cats, we might not be a good match since my great dane is a big part of my life.


- I don't have a specific ""type"". I like both fem and masc presenting people, and am more drawn to someone's vibes, but confidence and competence are major turn-ons for me 😊 


- Any DMs from any lurking cis men will result in immediate blocking/reporting.


We can exchange selfies once we've chatted more and both feel comfortable with it. I also have a discord for easier communication.


Thanks for reading this far! If you decide to reach out, tell me what your current favorite song is! What's on repeat for you right now?


Be brave! Come say hello if anything here resonated with you (I promise I don't bite unless you want me to 😂)


Looking forward to connecting with you!

I don't know if this is allowed so sorry please remove if it's not.

I recently moved to Vista to help my aging parents who have some medical issues. I am staying with them and working remotely from home but it is not a good environment for me to concentrate in, basically. Now, you might ask, why don't I just go to a coffee shop or the library? Well, the seating usually doesn't work for me. I have a physical disability that makes standing up or sitting up in a chair for more than an hour pretty painful. I usually work while laying down on a couch, or else sitting on a pillow on the floor with my back against the back of a couch. (Switching back and forth as I get more sore in one position to the other.) Most businesses and libraries don't have couches, and even if they do, they don't want me to put my feet on furniture or lie down on it.\* (My feet are clean, and I bring clean socks to put on before ever putting my feet up.) I've tried other things like anti-gravity folding chairs, lying on a yoga mat, etc., but really only the couch seems to work.

So, I was wondering if anyone with a couch wants to let me in their house to work during the day? That probably sounds pretty crazy. Please PM me if you want to negotiate something. Here are some things I have to offer:

\- my work is silent other than typing sounds; I don't need to make calls or have meetings or anything like that

\- I am good at taking care of pets like cats and dogs

\- I am cool with being a ""body-double"" if you have ADHD or something and want an accountability buddy to be there with you while you work

\- I'm neat and clean, have no interest in snooping through your stuff or eating your food, etc.

I say ""work"" but it's not currently paid. I'm an academic who hasn't found work yet so I'm editing journal articles, making conference presentations, writing research grants, that kind of thing. I'm living off savings currently so I don't have a big budget for a workspace.  And I do prefer to stay sleeping overnight at my parents' rather than rent somewhere else (they need me more in the evening/night than during the day).

So I've got about 6 months left to CCT in anaesthetics but today frankly I've had enough. I only had three coffee breaks so far and my cheeky odp rolled their eyes at my tiva/rocketamine/bilateral sacral paravertebral plan for my bum abscess patient. I have enjoyed all my training up til now and think anaesthetics is great, but this disrespect from the MDT is now just too far. I don't have any experience outside of medicine or any skills other than sudoku and day trading crypto. I can't be arsed to go through another six months of this shit just to become a consultant and have to deal with lip all the time.

But listen - there is hope for people like me. If you are in the same position, I want you to know that it's okay and I have hope for the future. And this is the thing that a lot of people forget - my dommy mommy wife is a lawyer and she can pay for everything. For everyone else who is contemplating quitting just before CCT, listen, you can do it - _just use your wife's cash_. 

It's *clap* that *clap* easy. 

Some of you might be women. That's still ok. There's only one difference to the failsafe plan - you can get a rich husband. Or even a wife if you want. It's the 21st century after all. But don't just follow the crowd, be a free spirit and ride the wave. I'm sure I will just jump into another job and won't regret this at all.

46m, I am new to consumer espresso machines. My employer provides commercial Barista machines at work and I have significant experience in making espressos and latte's using those high end machines. I learned by looking at videos and reading. I can make an excellent latte using La Marzocco and similar class machines. The coffee beans are provided by them and grinders are pre-calibrated so I have no experience there.

So, I decided to buy one for home use and after reading reviews decided on Breville as a brand and BES870XL as a beginners machine.

Now the problems:

1. Bitterness

I bought Starbucks Espresso beans. When I used them at the recommended grind setting of '5'. I could not extract a single drop.

I kept increasing and I get a decent enough extraction around 11. However, it tastes much bitter than I am used to. So my guess is that I am using the wrong beans perhaps with wrong grind setting.

2. Milk foam

She responded with “oh coffee, not today” and slightly smiled. But at this point I felt so awkward, I said “ok, bye I’m gonna get back to work” by the time I could even finish my sentence she looked down and carried on with her work.
