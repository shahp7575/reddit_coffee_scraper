1kcs4vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kcs4vb/how_do_you_figure_out_a_recipe_for_a_new_coffee/,How do you figure out a recipe for a new coffee?,"So... I have a small problem. Every time I buy a new and interesting coffee, it takes me a *good* few tries to figure out how I want to brew it. The only way I've determined to get it right is... rather brute force. I pick a starting grind size and brew temperature arbitrarily, and then I brew a bunch of small cups (9g coffee, 150g water), adjusting temperature (in 2 C increments) and grind size (in one notch increments).

If I'm doing well, I nail the grind size on the first try, and just brew at 4ish temperatures to figure out which I like.

If not, it can be a 4x3 grid lol.

So I have a couple of questions:

1. What do other y'all do? Do you have a system for figuring out a good place to start, to avoid burning through *so much* coffee while tuning?
2. Is there such a thing as a ""brewing grid"": a 3x5 grid of V60 filter paper holders, so that I can scan both parameters easily?",1,1746158952.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1kcs4py,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppreview/comments/1kcs4py/how_to_support_cardiovascular_health_and_recovery/,How to Support Cardiovascular Health and Recovery Without Stimulants,"If you're like me—mid-30s, training hard, trying to stay lean without falling apart—cardio and recovery aren’t just side quests. They’re survival.

After tracking everything from blood pressure to energy dips, I started dialing in a few habits that actually helped.

Here’s a breakdown of what made the biggest difference, especially if you’re tired of the stim-heavy BS.

**1. Cut the stimulants (or at least cycle them)**

Caffeine masks fatigue. It doesn’t fix it.

If you rely on a double scoop pre-workout just to survive your warm-up, you might want to ease off. I used to hammer pre-workout like it owed me money—and still feel wrecked by 2PM.

Try 1–2 weeks off all stims and see what your body feels like raw.

Bonus: Your natural energy regulation might bounce back quicker than expected.

**2. Daily Zone 2 cardio (even 15–20 minutes helps)**

Nothing fancy. Just low-intensity, steady movement that keeps your heart rate around 60–70% max.

Incline walk. Light bike. Row slow.

This helped me drop resting HR by 5–6 bpm over a few weeks—and I didn’t even lose muscle.

**3. Blood pressure tracking: the underrated metric**

You don’t need to be 50+ to care about BP.

Grab a cuff. Check your readings 3–4x/week.

What I learned: Small changes (less sodium at dinner, more leafy greens, a short walk post-meal) made a measurable difference.

Also: poor sleep = higher BP the next morning. Consistently.

**4. Use supersets for real conditioning**

Want to feel like your heart and lungs are working without adding cardio?

Try this:

* Front squats → Dumbbell RDLs → Sled push (3 rounds, 30s rest max)

This crushed me the first time, but after two weeks of this 2x/week, my intra-workout recovery jumped.

**5. Micronutrients > fancy ingredients**

You don’t need 27 ingredients with cool names.

Start with:

* Magnesium (helps sleep + BP)
* Potassium (if your diet’s low in whole foods)
* Omega-3s (EPA/DHA)
* CoQ10 (support for people doing a lot of cardio or anyone on statins)

Also: Eat beets. Actual ones. Nitrate-rich and good for blood flow. And no, chugging two scoops of greens powder doesn’t count.

**6. Prioritize sleep like a full-time job**

One week of trash sleep = worse training, slower recovery, elevated BP, higher cravings, and more brain fog.

You don’t need perfect sleep—just a consistent 7–8 hours and a wind-down routine that doesn’t involve 45 minutes of doomscrolling.

**7. Midday movement breaks > another coffee**

Instead of reaching for your 3PM “why am I like this?” espresso, walk for 8 minutes.

Seriously.

That mini walk increases blood flow, brings you out of your chair slump, and reduces the cortisol flatline that makes you crave carbs at 5PM.

**8. Strength train smart, not just hard**

You don’t need to max out every week to make gains.

Hit your compounds. Track your progress. But leave a rep or two in the tank unless you’re peaking.

Chronic under-recovery = chronic inflammation = trash cardiovascular health.

**9. Gut health matters more than you think**

Not trying to be a probiotic salesman, but:

* If your digestion is off, your recovery’s off.
* If your sleep’s off, your digestion’s usually off.

Add fermented foods (yogurt, kimchi, kefir). Reduce junk that spikes your blood sugar nonstop.

**10. Track fewer things, but track them consistently**

You don’t need 18 wearables.

Just track:

* Resting heart rate (weekly)
* Blood pressure (2–3x/week)
* Workout recovery (subjective notes in your log)
* Sleep hours (manually or with a ring/band if you want)

The goal isn’t perfection—it’s pattern recognition.

**Final thoughts**

You don’t need to overhaul your life. You just need to make a few quiet upgrades that compound.

If your energy’s flat, your sleep’s garbage, and you’re constantly hitting walls after workouts—it’s not just about motivation.

Sometimes your system needs a reset.

And no, it doesn’t have to include 400mg of caffeine and three proprietary blends.

Start with the basics. They work.",1,1746158938.0,suppreview,0,1.0,False
1kcs4gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1kcs4gf/softly_reclaiming_myself_after_a_break_up/,softly reclaiming myself after a break up,"Two weeks ago, I left a 4yr relationship because I caught him being unfaithful. I realized that I abandoned myself a ton in that relationship. The past two days, I spent time alone in a city hold lots of memories of us. It was so scary at first but I didn’t realize how much I needed it: I did some grieving & crying and then I gave myself permission to move on & created new memories of my own in the city. This new era is about pouring love into myself & doing more of what aligns with me. Today is the lightest I have felt since the break up. 

I’m looking forward to:

- my time being MY time!!!!
- making decisions about my future, for me!
- journaling, reading, and gyming on my own schedule
- deepening connections with my family & friends
- taking longer nature walks, until my mind & body feel satisfied
- watching tv shows and movies on my own timeline
- wearing my hair and makeup however the f*ck i want to
- eating what i wanna eat when i wanna eat it, dessert included 
- watching more sunrises & sunsets, from the beach, a city, a park, wherever my heart takes me
- slow mornings at local coffee shops: order a coffee, a pastry, read a book, people watch, journal
- slow mornings at farmers’ markets and buying myself flowers!
- going to concerts! & listening to live music :)
- visiting new art museums & taking my time to soak in its wanders
- taking up amateur photography
- buying a cute lil picnic basket & blanket and having more picnics


I know I still have healing to do. There will still be hard days. But today, my heart made a little room for more than grief. I felt joy, the kind that sneaks in when you finally make space for yourself.",1,1746158912.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False
1kcs4c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kcs4c3/need_a_new_alternative_to_weird_breakfast_routine/,Need a new alternative to weird breakfast routine. Help?,"Hi all,
So I am on keto, and at a regular weight for my height and age and am maintaining. 
I am a petite female with a lower than average-person-sized TDEE. However, this has not stopped me from making a habit out of a weird super high calorie breakfast.

Specifically anywhere from 2-2.75 oz almond or cashew butter *topped*, yes topped, with an additional 1oz pecans or pumpkin seeds— and a 16oz black coffee to drink. This is anywhere from 600-800cal easily.

It’s so bizarre. I have been eating this every morning for months— it keeps me full and energized from around 9:30am-6pm. 

As mentioned before, I am maintaining. I think this obsession came out of the initial weight loss and craving fats… I just came to love it and have always loved nut butters.
However, now I realize I need to break this habit because there are some days where I get less movement and I wish I had a lower calorie but still satiating easy breakfast alternative. I don’t like that this is now engrained in my routine.
Any advice or others who commiserate? 

I’ve considered smoothies but I’m clean keto, so no artificial sweeteners.

Thank you in advance.

1kcs3zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kcs3zt/how_does_alcohol_and_caffeine_affect_you/,How does alcohol and caffeine affect you,"Hello everyone, I’m currently waiting on my assessment but I highly suspect Imfo have ADHD. I just wanted to ask how alcohol and caffeine affects everyone who has been officially diagnosed with ADHD. Although I haven’t been officially diagnosed yet I just wanted to share how it affects me and compare to everyone else.

I find that when I drink alcohol, I just can’t function normally at all. Everything just becomes so difficult to do, even just ordering food on my phone or trying to book a taxi. I know this is normal when you’re drunk but I just feel like it affects so much worse than my friends. I also find that I’m a very blunt when I drink and say things I wouldn’t normally say when I’m sober which sometimes leads to people getting upset.

With caffeine, whether and energy drink or coffee, I find that it doesn’t really ‘energise’ me like it does for others. Instead, it just doesn’t really anything to me but sometimes,  it does make me nervous and jittery. I tried it one time before an exam as I’m never able to sleep before any exam and I just couldn’t stop shaking and tapping my foot during the exam, I was so much nervous than usual. After that, I just gave up with caffeine as it just wasn’t worth it for me.

I know those things are considered normal but I just feel like it’s heightened for me. I’m curious to find out how you guys all react to alcohol and caffeine and see if it may be caused by my potential ADHD or it’s just completely normal and how I am.",2,1746158865.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

My coworker who's an older person in her 60s is in charge of serving coffee and such and likes to eat healthy so she always has the salad bar. On our lunch break she was having a bowl of salad and she stated  that she heard a loud crunch when she bit down on the bite of salad. She spit out her food and didn't see any Forgien items in the salad (I told my supervisor and we checked the salad before  the main rush and we didn't find any forgein objects or anything out of the ordinary so it was okay) so my coworker deemed that it could of been the croutons since there crunchy or the seeds in her salad. 

Later on she went into the washroom and stated to me that she can see a tiny chip on one of her back teeth and she said ""guess I'm calling the dentist tomorrow"" she also wondered if she can get wsib to cover the dentist price since it did happen at work (we have dental insurance btw) I'm not too worried about it but I could hear her talking about how it's my fault that she chipped her tooth cause the croutons are too crunchy and among other things. There wasn't anything wrong with the salad bar though(no complaints or issues from the actual associates we cater too everyday) and my supervisor told me she would let our superiors know that we checked the salad bar and nothing was dangerous with it if my coworker decided to bring it up, but I'm just wondering could my supervisor sue me if she decided to go that route? 

Like there's no evidence of the salad bar being tainted or foreign objects in it so i don't know what grounds my coworker would have? Ik that wsib will still possibly provide support for the dental visit to fix her tooth but does she have power to sue me with out evidence?

1kcrxzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1kcrxzo/only_dated_my_ex_for_2_months_and_havent_gotten/,Only dated my ex for 2 months and haven’t gotten over her even after 2+ years,"My ex and I were friends/acquaintances from middle school years ago and I’d message her maybe once a year just to say hi. After I started college I decided to message her again but for some reason we really hit it off and I found out she liked me way back when.

Naturally, we started dating and the relationship was fantastic. I’d never felt so good in a relationship before that. We were playful, honest, supportive, and the physical stuff was the *absolute* best. But I was perhaps overly infatuated, she was always a very anxious person and the relationship fell apart. She was still living with her parents and that added more complications privacy-wise and other issues that she had to deal with. 

She eventually broke up with me over the phone and I thought I was handling it well, until I started to overthink things and get into my (delusional-romantic) movie character mode. (I should mention that we were sorta long-distance, around 2-3hrs away, but we both put in a great deal of effort to see each other once a week/every other).

I have family where she lives and so I impulsively decided to go visit them a couple days after the break-up. My ex and I called while I was on the way there, and I told her I was on the way and wanted to meet up and talk things through in person. I would’ve gotten there at around 9-10 pm. She was very perturbed by this and was scared that I was going to do something to do, which in retrospect is understandable, but at the time I was offended by it. After arguing for 20ish minutes I told her that I wasn’t going to go bc I didn’t want her to be uncomfortable. Instead we had coffee a couple days later and she had the most disturbed face, like I had murdered her cat or smth.

Anyways, she just restated everything she said over the phone, that she wasn’t ready for a relationship and that what I did freaked her out. But I could never get that look on her face out of my head, I felt so horrible and guilty, but eventually I forgave myself and moved on and for the most part forgot about her.

Since then, I’ve had an exponential increase in difficulty talking to women, partly due to my classes. But even the few women I have been with afterwards, I’ve lost 100% interest in after a week or two. And over the past few months I’ve been dreaming of my ex and memories of our time together will rise up, but really only how good I felt during that time.

I don’t know what to do with these feelings. I’ve stopped myself so many times from contacting her even though she still follows me. I’ve had no issues getting over previous relationship that lasted over a year and a couple that ended much worse. I feel a strong urge to be in a relationship, but every time the opportunity presents itself, I lose all interest. I have other issues too rn that you might attribute to shit life syndrome, so that might be the actual thing keeping me from forming new emotional attachments, but idk.

Sorry this was so long, but any advice? Should I contact her? Should I move on?

Please help, and thank you so much if you read all this!

1kcrx6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kcrx6o/a_place_called_home/,A Place Called Home.,"Thomas Wolfe once said you can never go home again. That's not always true, though. Sometimes you can go home again...if you're determined enough. And brave enough.

I finally summoned the courage to go home after twenty-five years. Twenty-five years of fleeing from the past and my memories of Allison.

I took the day off and left my apartment in the city around nine that morning (last Friday) and made the two-hour drive out into the country, and the further I got from the city, the closer I got to the house, the more I felt myself slipping slowly back into the past.

""As you can see, it needs a little work,"" the realtor had has told us.

Allison flashed me a sly smile behind the man's back. 'A little work' was an understatement. The old farmhouse was extremely run-down, which was why it was on the market at such a low price. The paint was peeling, the floors were rotted, the wiring was shot, the plumbing was rusted out, and most of the window frames had been eaten through by termites. I had told her rather dryly on the drive that it would have been more practical to bulldoze the place and rebuild it from the ground up, but she would not be swayed by my arguments. She had been steadfast in her drive to renovate the old house, as long as it took and however much it cost. A place out in the country, away from the chaotic, fast-paced crush of the city with its crowds and pollution and noise. A nice quiet place just for us, and the family we planned to someday raise.

I learned early in our relationship it was wise not to fight Allison when she set her mind on something; she was a very determined young woman. That was only one of the qualities that had attracted me to her in college.

In the end, she had won...although I suppose I had only been putting up a front in order to try and maintain a facade of masculine assertiveness. Token resistance in a vain and feeble bid to preserve my precious role as the Dominant Male. Macho posturing. And I think we had both known that. In truth, I would have given her the moon if she had asked for it. I had loved her that much...

I felt tears begin to seep down my cheeks as I drove on the interstate, remembering.

We had bought the old house and the four acres of land it sat upon with the money we had been saving together for the three years we had been married. We had spent the next year fixing the place up, doing most of the work ourselves. Allison's father had been a carpenter, and she'd learn a lot of the trade from him growing up. I vividly recall the days we had spent hammering and sawing and painting, the smell of sawdust and fresh paint and varnish...

The city was behind me now, I drove through the suburbs, recalling our mutual elation when the work had been finished, the old house now looking as if it had been newly constructed. New floors, new windows, new roof, new plumbing and electricity. The two of standing outside, admiring the house's pristine white paint and green trim. Allison laughing.  Our embrace and kiss.

Out of the suburbs, driving on a rural highway through the country. Woods, then cornfields.

To break the silence, and to take my mind off the past, I turned on the radio. I listened, transfixed, hearing the haunting, melancholy guitar chords that open an old Goo Goo Dolls song. A song that had come out the year we had married.

I listened, numb, as the familiar first lyric came out of the speakers:

*""And even though the moment passed me by...I still can't turn away...""*

Tears blurred my vision, and I had to pull over until they abated. I forced the tears to stop, wiping my eyes, disgusted by the mental image of myself; a fifty-three-year-old man moved to tears by a stupid song from nearly thirty years ago. Pathetic.

I sat there for a while long, contemplating my motives for this journey. What the hell was I doing? What was the point of this? What did I hope to accomplish going back to that house? The past was long gone. As dead and buried as Allison was. Why was I stirring up memories that were best forgotten? Was I trying vainly to recapture the essence of a time that was irrevocably lost, trying to live in my recollections of the past? Or was I just attempting to confront my past once and for all, to fully come to term with what had happened so I could finally and truly put it behind me once and for all, to heal and move on?

I considered just turning back and heading home. But I was only a couple miles from my objective now. To admit defeat and retreat when I was so close, when I had already come so far, would be to acknowledge my own cowardice to myself.

I pulled back onto the road and continued driving.

Allison was in the seventh month of her pregnancy when it happened. She had shaken me awake in the middle of the night, panicked. Even though my brain had still been half asleep, I had been instantly aware that something was wrong. The sheets were wet and sticky. For a brief instant I had wondered if she had gone into an early labor...but only for an instant. Turning on the bedside lamp I had seen it hadn't been water the bed was soaked with. It was on everything; the blankets, my pajamas, most of all Allison. Her nightgown was saturated with the awful red wetness that was seeping from between her thighs...

I only recall the rest as a rush of blurred, dream-like impressions that can't even rightly be called memories; just hazy mental snapshots. The ambulance. The hospital. The waiting room. The anxious hours. The solemn-faced doctor in blood-spattered scrubs and his routine words of consolation and regret. The funeral. They had been buried together, in the same coffin.

There it was, just half a mile distant. The house I hadn't laid eyes on in a quarter century. The house I had left after burying Allison, fleeing for the city, determined to leave behind all vestiges of the man I had been, to bury my past with Allison and the child and become someone new, someone different. I had returned to school, earning a master's degree in Business Law. I had shaven my beard, had traded my paintbrushes and canvases and easel for a suit and a briefcase. I had thrown myself into my career, rising up to the position of Senior Partner. A brief, loveless second marriage to a woman who had been the opposite of Allison in every way (intentional on my part). No children had come of it. Private golf courses and yacht parties and business trips. My hair had thinned, my stomach had widened, I had developed an ulcer and hemorrhoids.

And through all those years, I had still retained ownership of the house, dutifully paying the property taxes each year, even though I had never returned...until now. Why had I held onto it for so long when everything else had been left behind, cast to the winds? I had burned all the pictures, destroyed all the souvenirs of the five years we had been together.  Everything that had even the most tangential connection to the only woman I had ever truly loved, desperately trying to spare myself the pain of remembering, as if by denying Allison's entire existence, I could convince myself that she had never been a part of my life.

But why had I kept the house? Why? Because Allison had loved it, that's why. Had put so much effort into restoring it. And I couldn't bear to dishonor her memory but selling it to strangers. I owed her that much, anyway. The house was a monument to her, a testament to my love for her.

I turned into the driveway, pulling up to the house and shutting off my engine. I sat there for a while, just staring at it.

It had fallen into a state of disrepair in the twenty-five years since I had left. The paint was peeling, the windows dirty, the lawn heavily overgrown. I felt my heart sink at the sight of it. It looked just as bad as it had when we had first purchased it. I had let it fall into ruin. Allison would be ashamed of my neglect.

I got out and stepped up the porch. I took out my keys, sorting through them until I found the one that hadn't been on the ring until this morning, the one I had kept in a shoebox in the back of the closet for so long. The one that unlocked the front door. The lock turned with surprising ease, as if I had only been away for a short time. In my distracted state, I attached no significance to this fact.

With a brief hesitation, I turned the knob and opened wide the door.

The smell of mildew and stale air assailed my nostrils immediately. The smell of...well, a long-vacant home that hasn't been aired out in ages. Once again, I momentarily hesitated. Then, gathering my courage, I stepped inside.

I was in the mud room that opened up onto the living room. It was gloomy; the lights were off, and the only illumination came through the windows. I instinctively flipped the light switch before remembering that the electricity wasn't paid up. It didn't matter; there was enough natural light for me to see my way.

I entered the living room and looked around with sad wonder. It was like a time capsule; everything was exactly as I had left it on that long-ago September afternoon, a week after the funeral. Newspapers and magazines dated 2000 (now yellowed and faded with age) still covered the coffee table's surface. The concave screen of the CRT TV reflected the room like a dead eye. Dust lay in a thick layer over everything.

I peered through the kitchen entryway. A bowl of ancient, petrified oranges still stood on the table, shriveled into effigies of themselves. Dusty plates were still stacked vertically in the drainer beside the sink. A dirty coffee cup that still had a scum of dried residue at the bottom stood on a saucer atop the counter next to the Silex.

I turned and headed into the hallway that led to the stairwell. This was the difficult part, the part I had been dreading. But I had to see this through. I had come all this way. Now was the time to confront the demons of my past; to exorcise them. Like a condemned man climbing the gallows, I ascended the stairs to the second floor.

A huge water stain on the hallway ceiling from where the roof had leaked. I entered the bedroom I had once shared with Allison. I stood regarding the bare mattress, where everything had gone horribly wrong, for some time. I glanced around. The framed *Eraserhead* poster on the closet door had been almost completely bleached white by the sunlight that slanted through the windows in the east wall. The dresser drawers still stood open from when I had hastily packed the few necessary belongings I had taken, abandoning everything else. The surface of Allison's vanity table was bare; I had thrown out all her cosmetics and perfumes. But yet...

I sniffed the air.

Strange. For a few seconds I seemed to detect some familiar scent in the stale air. The phantom scent lingered just long enough for me to identify it. The lavender perfume that had been Allison's favorite. No sooner did I recognize it, the scent was gone from the air. I must have imagined it.

I left the bedroom, going down to the last room at the end of the hall. I stood in the doorway.

It was the nursery we had set up. The crib stood empty, the mobile above it hung motionless. The walls were decorated with characters from *The Rugrats.* A stuffed pink bunny sat on the windowsill like a lone sentinel unaware that it was standing guard for a cause long since lost. I looked into that awful room, the room I had been avoiding for twenty-five years, the room I hadn't set foot in since the day before Allison had died. My mind conjured a vision; laid over this barren room like a double image I saw a past that had never been. A future that had never come. I could almost hear a baby crying.

That did it. I was besieged by a flood of memories, long repressed. I remembered everything with perfect recall; sounds and smells and colors.

I broke down. My knees buckled. I slid down the door jam and began to weep deeply, from the depths of my soul, my body wracked with the forceful sobs I was emitting, sobs from a well of grief and loss that had stood untapped for so many years.

At long last it ceased. When I had myself back under control, I forced myself into a standing position. I felt empty now, but not in a good, cathartic, spiritually cleansed way; just a sort of cold, blue numbness. I felt like a dead man in a tomb.

The tomb was this house.

I shouldn't have come here. This whole trip was a failure. All I had done was re-open the old wound.

I left the nursery, went down the hall, and started back downstairs to leave.

At the bottom, I halted, confused. I smelled the air again. I smelled...fresh coffee. Fried bacon. Maple syrup. I followed the scent of breakfast into the kitchen. I stood in the door, transfixed, completely nonplussed by what I was seeing.

The dust and dinginess were gone. The lights were on. The kitchen had been transformed, restored to its former immaculateness. The oranges on the table were fresh. Two plates were set out, their contents half-eaten, next to two half-drank cups of coffee.

I whirled around, started, at the sudden sound of the TV coming to life behind me. The *Today* show was on the screen, not Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin, but Katie Couric and Matt Lauer. The living room had likewise changed, reverted back to how it had been back in 2000, when Allison was still--

I jerked my head up at the ceiling. I could hear music upstairs. The stereo system in the bedroom was playing an old Sinead O'Connor song that Allison had loved. ""Nothing Compares 2 U.""

This wasn't happening. It *couldn't* be happening. I was hallucinating, or dreaming, or insane.

With dreamy slowness, I began to climb back upstairs.

In the hallway. I passed the open bedroom door without a glance, Sinead O'Connor still singing.

*""Cause nothing compares... Nothing compares to you...""*

I could hear other voices now, coming from the nursery at the end of the hallway. A woman's voice, singing a lullaby, and the high-pitched giggle of an infant.

I could smell lavender perfume.

I felt fresh tears well in my eyes and roll down my cheeks. I choked back a sob. Slowly I approached the nursery door.

She was sitting in a chair beside the crib. She was facing away, her back to me, but I recognized her long blonde hair. She was wearing her old pink bathroom. She was holding something on her lap; something bundled in a blanket. I couldn't make out what it was.

I took three steps into the nursery, then could go no further. I stood there, trembling. She continued to sing the lullaby, unaware of my presence.  I spoke her name; my voice choked with emotion.

She fell abruptly silent. A moment of silence, an eternity of silence, passed.

""Ryan,"" she said, without turning around, and her voice was exactly as I'd remembered it. ""You finally came home. I always knew you would. We've been waiting for you for so long.""

""Allison,"" I repeated. I seemed incapable of saying anything else.

""I missed you so much,"" she said, standing from the chair. ""But now you're finally here, where you belong, and we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.""

I held out my arms, preparing to embrace her, again, after all these years.

She turned.

I saw her face.

Or rather, the lack thereof.

Her vacant eye sockets, above the black, triangular cavity of her nose, peered at me. When she spoke, articulating syllables that shouldn't have been possible due to her lack of lips, I could see the decayed muscles and tendons that controlled her fleshless jaw moving.

""Am I still beautiful after all these years, Ryan?""

I stagger back, my mind reeling with blinding, freezing white terror, unable to think coherently.

She -- it -- took a step towards me, holding the blanketed bundle up for my inspection. A squirming, nearly indistinguishable mass of tiny bones and putrid flesh.

""Don't you want to hold our daughter, Ryan? She's missed you too.""

""Stay away from me,"" I gasped.  I backed away from them, the grisly apparitions of my dead wife and child.

""Why? Isn't this what you've always wanted? To have us back?""

""You're dead!"" I wailed.

""And so are you, Ryan,"" Allison replied. ""You've been a living dead man for twenty-five years. You killed your own heart when we died, because you decided loving anyone else was too painful. You've been a soulless, joyless shell of a man ever since. You left us behind. In this house. The life we had together. You never allowed yourself to grieve for us. To mourn us. You never let yourself heal and move on and live again. Love again. But still we waited for you. Because we knew eventually you would come back home to us. Because we knew deep down you couldn't truly forget about us.""

The smell of lavender was gone, replaced with the rank smell of decomposition. 

""Please,"" I whimpered, crying again. ""Please stop. Can't you be like you were? Like I remember you?""

""We can't, Ryan. This is what death has reduced us to. The past can't be changed. That which is dead cannot be restored to life. But if you want to be with us...truly be with us...you can kill yourself. Get a knife from the kitchen. Cut your wrists. You'll be dead like us. And we can be together. In death. Forever.""

*""NO!""* I wailed. I turned around and fled, running, fleeing once again from that house. I looked back once, certain they would be coming after me, those awful specters of my past, those tragic, ghastly parodies of Allison and the baby.

But they didn't follow me.

I ran outside to my car. I sped away, my heart racing. But before I did, I took one last look at the house. In the upstairs window I saw the figure of Allison, watching me.

\*\*\*\*\*

That was a week ago. I called in sick on Monday, telling my secretary I had the flu. I haven't left my apartment since I got back home late Friday evening. I want to believe it didn't really happen, that I experienced some kind of psychotic episode in that house and imagined the entire thing.

But I know I didn't.

Allison won't let me believe that. She keeps calling me. Even though I turned my phone off after the first call, it still keeps ringing, the number coming in on the ID as ""UNKNOWN."" She leaves me voicemail, begging me to come back to her and our daughter, to commit suicide.

I keep smelling her lavender perfume.

And I keeping hearing that Sinead O'Connor song playing throughout my apartment, coming from no apparent source. It's playing constantly now, gradually driving me insane.

Even in my dreams I cannot escape Allison. The first couple nights they were nightmares. But, the past few nights, the dreams have changed. Become somewhat rather pleasant. Allison and the infant are gradually appearing less and less decayed. Allison is appearing more and more beautiful and vibrant, as she was in life. She promises me we can be happy together in death, all three of us. We can be the family we were always meant to be.

And oh dear God, I'm beginning to think she may be right. I have a gun I keep in a safe in the back of my closet, for home protection. Lately I've been thinking of taking it out. And then going back to that house.

I think next time I go home, I'll be home to stay.",1,1746158224.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1kcrtb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kcrtb3/mixing_water_for_consistent_greattasting_coffee/,"Mixing Water for Consistent, Great-Tasting Coffee (Melbourne-Based)","Hey everyone!
I’m based in Melbourne, and the tap water at my place reads around 75ppm. It has a noticeable mineral/iron taste which I suspect is from old piping. For drinking and brewing, I’ve just been using tap water filtered through a Brita jug. It’s decent for drinking, and makes okay coffee, but nothing amazing.

My goals with brewing water are:
1. To brew a great-tasting cup.
2. To have consistent results, wherever I brew.

The second point is pretty important as I often make coffee in different parts of Melbourne and other countries (at friends’ houses, events, etc.), and the tap water varies a lot from suburb to suburb. So I’ve been trying to mix my own brewing water to bring some consistency to my brews.

Some of my favourite coffees and drinking water that I've tried at coffee shops, have been in places like North Melbourne, Brunswick, and Collingwood. I’ve been trying to replicate that kind of water profile. The water itself is sweet, thick and soft with no minerals taste. The brews are similar, and also highlight delicate notes of whatever the coffee has to offer, with great, full texture and sweetness.

I started with the Barista Hustle water guide, since it’s a popular and beginner-friendly place to start. I’ve been experimenting with the Melbourne Water, Rao Water, and WOC Budapest Water recipes, but I haven’t had great results so far.

The Melbourne Water recipe makes my brews taste texturally nice, thick and sweet, but strangely flat. Every coffee ends up tasting like... nothing? No distinct flavours come through at all. There's also no acidity present.

The Rao and WOC waters bring out a bit more flavour, but I’m noticing a mild salinity that’s a bit off-putting, especially when drinking coffee daily. There's also no acidity present, and the notes which do come through are often muddled or followed by a harsh, almost tart or pith-y, finish.


So I’m wondering, where should I go from here?
Should I try a different guide or approach? Should I adjust the mineral levels (up/down)? Does anyone here have a recipe they swear by?

Would really appreciate any thoughts, advice, or personal experiences. Sorry for the long wall of text, thankyou in advance! ",1,1746157827.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Jumping straight in (and keeping it vague) I had a massive crush on a coworker (Jake) who I worked with a year ago, my time at the job ended and I figured we wouldn't cross paths again.

For a bit of context I had thought he had a bit of a crush on me as well, his work bestie would wingman for him a bit, I had mentioned wanted going to the beach more often and his friend went ""oh you know who loves the beach? Jake!"" There was also a few times my friends and I would catch him walking by our cubicle to look at me, he even started going on coffee runs with his friend at the same time my friend and I would go on our coffee walks. OH during a party when I would walk around he would follow closely behind me, and our conversations were always fantastic.

Anyway, after I left I had lingering thoughts and moments of ""ahh I wonder what he's doing?"" but didn't/couldn't act on it as I had no way to contact him. Eventually we matched on a dating app fairly recently, started chatting and then he ghosted me. I won't lie it is the first time that I haven't gotten annoyed or taken a ghosting personally LMAO. A few close friends (including those I worked with) who know about the situation keep saying that it was super clear that he was into me and they are confused at his ghosting (but not unmatching) and why I'm not upset about the ghosting.

Right now I'm just confused with myself and how I feel, I keep having romantic dreams and feelings about about him, and cannot stop thinking about him. It's not to a point where he's the only thing I think of but it's almost like he creeps into the corners of my mind when I'm not paying attention. Like I was watching Parks and Rec not that long ago and in the middle of the drink off between Ron's mom Tammy, Tammy 1, and Leslie BAM I was thinking about him. I think of him pretty fondly, and I guess I do welcome the romantic dreams about him but I'm just so unsure of why I can't just mentally let him go. Do I still have a crush on him? Am I in love with this memory of him and denying it? Is this limerence? Is this something entirely different?

1kcrr4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1kcrr4m/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt bad but he knew my boyfriend didn’t like me talking to guy friends as he knew about my deceased friend so I think he understood. 

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Edited: this male friend never expressed romantic interest in me. Neither did I to him. Neither of us flirted with eachother or expressed romantic interest at all.",0,1746157609.0,SeriousConversation,4,0.33,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of an ice machine filter is determined by several critical features. These features directly impact the filter's ability to remove contaminants and deliver clean, great-tasting ice.

**Filtration Media:** The type of filtration media used is paramount.

High-quality filters utilize activated carbon, which is highly effective at removing chlorine, chloramine, sediment, and other organic compounds that can affect the taste and odor of ice. Some filters also incorporate specialized media for reducing scale buildup, which is a common problem in ice machines. The specific type and blend of media directly correlate to the filter's overall performance and contaminant removal capabilities.

**Filter Capacity:** The filter capacity indicates the amount of water a filter can effectively treat before needing replacement.

Capacity is typically measured in gallons or liters. A higher capacity filter will generally last longer and require less frequent replacement, making it a more cost-effective option in the long run. It's essential to choose a filter with a capacity that aligns with your ice machine's water usage and ice production volume.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate refers to the speed at which water passes through the filter.

An adequate flow rate is crucial for ensuring that your ice machine receives a sufficient supply of water to operate efficiently. A filter with a low flow rate can restrict water flow, leading to reduced ice production or even damage to the ice machine. The flow rate should be compatible with your ice machine's specifications.

**Micron Rating:** The micron rating indicates the size of particles the filter can effectively remove.

A lower micron rating signifies a finer filter, capable of capturing smaller particles like sediment, rust, and other debris. For ice machines, a micron rating of 5 or lower is generally recommended to ensure that the ice is free from visible impurities. This ensures the ice is not only cleaner but also more aesthetically pleasing.

**Certifications:** Look for filters that are certified by reputable organizations such as NSF International.

NSF certification indicates that the filter has been tested and meets stringent standards for contaminant reduction and material safety. This provides assurance that the filter performs as claimed and does not introduce harmful substances into the water supply. Certification is a strong indicator of product quality and reliability.

**Housing Material:** The durability of the filter housing is also important.

High-quality filters utilize robust materials like reinforced plastic or stainless steel to withstand water pressure and prevent leaks. A well-constructed housing will ensure that the filter operates reliably and does not crack or break under normal operating conditions. The housing should also be easy to install and replace.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality ice machine filter offers several significant benefits, impacting the quality of your ice, the longevity of your machine, and overall cost savings.

**Improved Ice Quality:** A high-quality filter removes impurities and contaminants that can affect the taste, odor, and appearance of ice.

This results in ice that is clear, clean, and free from unpleasant tastes. The improved ice quality enhances the flavor of beverages and provides a more enjoyable experience for users. For businesses, this translates to happier customers and a better reputation.

**Extended Ice Machine Lifespan:** By removing sediment and scale-forming minerals, a filter helps to protect the ice machine from damage and premature wear.

Scale buildup can clog water lines, reduce efficiency, and ultimately lead to costly repairs or replacement. A filter helps to prevent these issues, extending the lifespan of the ice machine and reducing maintenance costs. Regular filter replacement is a simple and effective way to safeguard your investment.

**Reduced Maintenance Costs:** By preventing scale buildup and other issues, a filter reduces the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance of the ice machine.

This saves time and money on labor and cleaning supplies. A properly maintained ice machine operates more efficiently, consuming less energy and producing more ice per unit of water. This leads to further cost savings over the life of the machine.

**Healthier Ice:** Filters remove harmful contaminants such as chlorine, lead, and bacteria, ensuring that the ice is safe for consumption.

This is particularly important for businesses that serve ice to customers. Using a filter demonstrates a commitment to providing a safe and healthy product, which can enhance customer trust and loyalty. Clean ice contributes to overall health and well-being.

**Better Tasting Beverages:** Clean, clear ice enhances the taste of beverages, allowing the flavors to shine through without interference from impurities.

This is especially important for cocktails, iced coffee, and other drinks where the ice is a significant component. High-quality ice elevates the drinking experience and makes beverages more enjoyable. This can be a significant selling point for businesses that prioritize quality and customer satisfaction.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about ice machine filters:

**How often should I replace my ice machine filter?**

The replacement frequency depends on the filter's capacity and the water quality in your area. Generally, it's recommended to replace the filter every 6 to 12 months for residential use and every 3 to 6 months for commercial use. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific replacement guidelines.

**How do I know if my ice machine filter needs to be replaced?**

Several signs indicate that your ice machine filter needs replacement. These include reduced ice production, cloudy or discolored ice, a noticeable change in the taste or odor of the ice, and a decrease in water flow to the ice machine. Regular inspection of the ice quality and machine performance can help you determine when it's time for a new filter.

**Are all ice machine filters compatible with all ice machines?**

No, not all ice machine filters are universally compatible. It's essential to choose a filter that is specifically designed for your ice machine model or that is compatible with the filter housing. Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility before purchasing a filter. Using an incompatible filter can lead to reduced performance or even damage to the ice machine.

**Can I use a standard water filter instead of an ice machine filter?**

While a standard water filter can remove some impurities, it may not be as effective as an ice machine filter in addressing the specific contaminants that affect ice quality and machine performance. Ice machine filters are typically designed with specialized media and micron ratings to optimize ice clarity and prevent scale buildup. Using a dedicated ice machine filter is generally recommended for best results.

1kcrq6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1kcrq6o/advice_wlw/,Advice (WLW),"I need some insight from other people on this situation cause it’s driving me crazy lol
Basically 2mo ago I (22F, lesbian) started a new job where I met my current coworker (23F, bi) and whom I immediately developed a crush on. She’s the depiction of what my exact type is, physically and emotionally.
The thing is, ever since I started working there we’ve been flirting like CRAZY, it’s all very playful and all (our boss already told us jokingly that he’d kill us if we started dating cause he’d then have to fire one of us) we touch hands at every chance we get, hug each other for a good long minute or more when we’re tired, call each other pet names, make dirty jokes/comments etc constantly…only recently we’ve started going out together (not as in on a date, but as friends going out and getting chores done) and she always pays for my coffee and food. Yesterday night we were supposed to have drinks with everybody from work but they all ditched the plans so we decided to go together just the two of us and god I had such a good time, conversation flowed, we laughed a lot, and at some point in the conversation (we were talking about relationships) she looks at me and says “hey, if you ever wanna date, I’m hereee” and laughs, (this is not the first time she’s made a comment like this, just the first time she flat out said it to me) so I look at her and say “would you really date me if you could?” She takes her sweet time taking a drag of her cigarette and then says “I would SO date you.” Then we get interrupted by a friend in common and never come back to the topic.
My issue and where I need insight is:
She’s currently talking to someone and going out with them, does she complain about the girl sometimes at work? Yes. Whenever our coworkers ask Her about the girl and if it’s serious she says it’s not, but idk. She is someone who loves being with people, doesn’t really like being alone romantically, I don’t know if flirting with me and or dating that girl is just something to pass the time with until she finds something better or if I can’t take a fucking hint.
I need advice, what should I do? Should I even do anything? Ever since that comment from last night this has been driving me nuts…cause I would SO date her.",2,1746157517.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False

1kcroxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1kcroxd/please_help_me_with_motivation_its_my_wedding/,Please help me with motivation. It’s my wedding year and I am quitting alone.,"Hi. This is my first post so I hope I do it correctly. It will be long so bear with me. I would love to hear kind words, success stories, or any kind of reassurance that I can do this. Seriously any proof of light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you in advance. 

I (26F) have been vaping for several years; small mods in high school, juul in college, disposables after that. It started to become a daily thing during covid, so I am coming up on 5 years of being heavily addicted to disposables. And by heavily I mean wake up, vape. Before shower, vape. After shower, vape. Commute to work, at work, at events, out with friends, in bathrooms, at the airport (I know - awful) etc., vape. Quick hit before and after every meal, with my coffee, while watching tv or reading. I cannot remember a time in the last five years that I did not have my vape on me, except for last year around this time when I tried to quit for the first time. 

Clearly I failed, because here I am. I only made it maybe 5 full days without it a year ago. Now comes the PLEASE do not judge me part. (Seriously please do not be mean in the comments I am already a very sensitive person) 

My partner, parents, and friends all believe I have quit. That I was successful a year ago when I first tried, and that I now only vape socially when I am in a group of friends (most of my friends vape in social situations,  others vape regularly but never as much as I did). The reason they believe I quit is simply because I told them I did. That I was successful and it “wasn’t that hard”. Of course it wasn’t hard because I started up again less than a week later in full force. 
In all honesty I felt too devastated, pissed, mad, embarrassed, and every other negative thing about myself failing to ever tell them the truth. 

So yes, for an entire year I have been secretly vaping with no one knowing. Trust me, I know how awful it is. I feel guilt every hour of every day, especially hiding this from my partner, who is now my fiancé. He has never vaped, and was very supportive in my goal to quit a year ago and had been wanting me to quit for a long time. Yet the addiction has always outweighed my guilt because my brain tells me I fucking need this stupid little stick of nicotine. 

We are getting married in the fall and all I want is to be vape free for the wedding. I refuse to have my wedding day revolve around the little devil stick. To have to worry about getting my nicotine fix every fifteen minutes when I should just want to soak in the happiness and love and not have to sneak away to take a hit. 

Now back to the current day. I have been “vape free” for one week and two days - meaning I have not purchased a new one since my last disposable died 9 days ago. I started hitting old dead disposables (I kept them all in a drawer after they died for if I ever ran out because they always end up having a few more hits in them) but those completely ran dry last weekend. I purchased nicotine gum initially but all it does is give me a stomach ache and make me burp nonstop, so I don’t really want to keep trying that. I came across this Reddit page a few days ago and have been reading it when I feel like driving to the store and buying a vape. I have been eating a shit ton of sunflower seeds, sour candy, and chocolate candy. Chewing lots of gum and drinking water out of a straw too. I’ve been either trying to keep busy with my hands when at home (cooking, baking, cleaning, coloring, going through drawers and closets and shit) or doom scrolling on my phone. Luckily my work is very hands on so I can stay busy there. 

But holy shit the brain fog is INSANELY real. I have zoned out more times than I can count when I’m in a conversation with someone or even just sitting on my phone. It’s like there’s a haze over my every thought. Without diving too deep into the topic, I am also worrying about my increase in appetite. I’m sure everyone knows the pressure brides are put under to be perfect and fit for their wedding, so I am slightly freaking out about weight gain because of this. But anyways…

I have noticed the cravings becoming less and less (only hitting me once an hour now vs every five minutes for example) and I AM proud of me for talking myself out of going to buy one every time I want to. And trust me I’ve had my keys in hand, excuses made up in my mind, ready to head to the store a minimum of 50 times now. But it still has been so fucking difficult. There have genuinely been thoughts in my head that I will die without my vape. What is the point of being here without my vape (not suicidal - just in a “I miss it and this is my lifeline” way). My vape is my best friend. My vape is a part of me. All the bad and stupid and nonsensical shit. 

And the most difficult of all is I am going through it completely alone. Not a soul knows how fucking hard it is. I also feel guilty because I have been a complete raging bitch or an emotional whiny baby about 90% of the time over the last week, yet no one knows why (I keep blaming it on my period which isn’t a stretch because my PMS is always awful). So instead I’ve tried to distance myself or stay occupied away from my partner. (And no I will not tell anyone that I have been lying for a year about originally quitting just to have support - I just won’t. Too embarrassed.) 

All in all, I have many, many moments where I do NOT see the light at the end of the tunnel and my brain tries to talk itself into going to buy just one more. Because this time I will do it casually, or less, or whatever other bullshit! I really just want to fucking quit quitting. 
Yet there is the very slim % of time that I feel motivated, that I know I can do this. I am thrilled and excited to be vape free at my wedding and honeymoon, and all the other good things coming my way. And that’s what has kept me going. 

So that’s it. I just felt the need to type out my thoughts into this abyss because I cannot tell anyone in my life. Vent finally over. 

Any advice, support, or kind words would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

TLDR; currently one ish week into quitting. Goal is to quit because it is my wedding year and I refuse to vape at my wedding. But I am doing it all alone because my partner, friends, & family think I quit long ago. It’s very hard and I want to quit quitting. ",1,1746157391.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False
1kcromw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychDoctoralStudents/comments/1kcromw/what_i_learned_from_my_phd_journey_lessons_i_wish/,What I Learned From My PhD Journey: Lessons I Wish I Had Known To Make It Through and Avoid Burnout,"Posted: r/PhDStress OP: u/kamylio

I've been ABD (All But Dissertation) for longer than I ever imagined, and my PhD journey has been one of the hardest chapters of my life. Between clinical depression, severe burnout, financial stress, and life challenges like divorce, quarantine, family crises and managing mental health, l've had to learn the hard way how to navigate this path.

Looking back now, I realize there are some lessons I wish I had learned sooner. Lessons I wish someone would have told me and that I want to share for anyone else going through a difficult time.

1. Your mental and physical health is the foundation of everything. For too long, I neglected my own well-being in the name of pushing through deadlines and expectations. This left me burnt out, stuck, and unable to function. I now realize that prioritizing my health whether through therapy, exercise, or just giving myself permission to rest isn't a weakness; it's essential. You'll work more effectively and with more clarity if you're not running on empty. Stop telling yourself you'll take care of yourself later because later won't come if you don't allow for it.

2. Work-life balance is a necessity, not a luxury. The PhD can feel like it demands everything from you, but the truth is, it doesn't have to. I regret sacrificing hobbies, social connections, and simple joys because I thought I didn't have time for them. Worst of all I sacrificed my health. In hindsight, these things are what fuel you to keep going. A walk, a coffee with a friend, or a creative project outside of your research can make all the ditterence.

3. Your perception of how others may see you doesn't define your worth. My advisor didn't advise me much, and that lack of guidance made me question myself constantly. It's easy to internalize that kind of experience, but l've learned that your value as a person and a scholar isn't determined by other people's opinion. Other people can't see your additional and unique struggles whether that is learning disabilities, language barriers, financial problems, family or life crisis, or mental or physical health problems. Your journey is unique to you and just because additional struggles can slow your progress doesn't mean it devalues your research or your abilities. Your journey is as unique as it is yours meaning that your pace can be unique to you.
Feel ok with your progress rather than constantly berating yourself for it. Seek support from peers, mentors, and communities outside your immediate academic circle. They can remind you of your strengths and give you the perspective you need.

4. Redefine success for yourself. I used to think success meant perfection: finishing my PhD quickly, landing the ""perfect"" academic job, and meeting all the expectations I placed on myself. But l've learned that success is personal. For me, it's about balance, making an impact where I can, and living a life that feels meaningful. Don't let someone else's definition of success dictate yours.

5. The PhD is just one chapter, not the whole book. For a long time, my identity was tied to my PhD. I couldn't imagine life beyond it, and that mindset made every setback feel catastrophic. It's taken time, but I now see my PhD as one part of my journey, not the entirety of who I am. If academia doesn't end up being the right path, it's okay to pivot. Your dissertation doesn't define your success. Most do not make it this far. Be proud of what you have already learned and achieved.

If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, I want you to know you're not alone. It's okay to take a step back, to prioritize yourself, and to move forward at your own pace. The PhD is a marathon, not a sprint, and finishing doesn't have to mean sacrificing your happiness.

What helped me most was realizing that I didn't need all the answers at once or know exactly where I was going. I focused on small, manageable steps and tried to reconnect with the things that made me happy outside of work. When I began doing that everything began falling into place. Wherever you are in your journey, I hope you can find space to do the same.

You've got this! Remember to be kind to yourself, prioritize your health, and respect your unique journey and pace.",1,1746157361.0,PsychDoctoralStudents,0,1.0,False

My ex boyfriend has been hanging out with me recently on and off and he just told me that he can't get back together with me. For some context: I met him in middle school and we started dating our freshman year. Him and I are like peas in a pod and have been since we met each other. Sure, our relationship wasn't perfect but it worked. He was my person and I was his and we fit so well together.

The reason why we broke up is because I was being SA'ed by a man that he knew and was our club advisor, and he wanted to groom me into.. you know. I had no idea obviously and believed his lies about how he was treating me bad... you get the point. I broke up with him and spent months going on and off with my ex until eventually we went to contact.

Eventually months later it all came out about the said guy and I reached out to my ex, who started to ask really mean and not well thought-out questions which made me go no contact with him again. (For some context: He thought something was going on between me and the guy, and tried with two other male friends to expose the said guy. I wouldn't let them because the guy said if he was going down, I was too. So when the truth came out and kids at my school put together that when the news channels and gossip spread of what this said guy did to a girl at our school, and I hadn't been there in two weeks and had pictures of me and said guy up on social media and was known to be close to him, people knew it was me and started asking my ex. I think it finally made him break and not think before sending those messages.)

After being no contact for months, I eventually reached back out to him. We met up at a local coffee shop and talked, he explained that he didn't know what I was going through and shouldn't have asked the questions he did. I accepted his apology and we talked/called on and off for a few months.

Now, we've been hanging out for about 2 months at my house and around town, and the 2nd to last time we hung out, I had just gotten nails on. I asked if he wanted me to scratch his head because he always loved when I did. He said yes and the more I scratched, the more he melted into me. I eventually stopped scratching his head and he asked if I could do it again. I said yes and we moved over to my couch to sit, watch a show and scratch his head. I let him lay down on my lap and as time went on, he started moving around, eventually having me lay flat and his head nestled in my stomach.

I thought this was a turning point and he was genuinely starting to like me again. After he got up and was super flirty with me, shoving and tickling me, and then we walked out to his car and he left. After this we texted and called for a few days after and then it was SUPER off and on after that. I asked him to hangout maybe ten times. Desperate, I know, but all I wanted to do was see him. We called a few times and he said he'd like to see me but he was super busy.

Eventually comes last Thursday. He finally agrees to come over, and we eat dinner with my family. After dinner we go up to my room and we start talking. At first it's chit-chat but then we start talking about how he's been having a lot of anxiety recently, which turns into him saying how it's hard for him to hang out with me. He says this a lot, sometimes talking about how he needs time before we hang out again because it's difficult for him,  or how he does want to hangout but it gives him mixed emotions and it's hard for him to be present. The reason why is because he says that we have so many memories together and it's hard to push past that. We dated for over a year and we're both of each other's first love. I know ""first loves"" are the hardest to get over but let me tell you, we were both DISTRAUGHT. Even though it wasn't my decision for the most part and I was groomed into thinking it was a good idea, I still knew that I shouldn't have dome it and felt the grief with that. He stopped eating, became depressed for the first time, and began to isolate.

This brings me to what he started to say and gives some context behind it.

He said that when I was scratching his head, he wanted to go back to what we had. He still hasn't gotten over me even though it's been almost two years since we first started dating, how his friends tell him to get over but he can't, that the feelings are still there every time he looks are me, but he can't go back to it. He said he wants to like nothing else in the world but he can't do it to himself. The first time he lost me he said was the hardest thing that's ever happened to him and he couldn't lose me again.

I asked him what if it did work out though? What if he didn't lose me again? What if it was perfect and everything worked out. He said he just couldn't and that he knew in his gut that he couldn't do it to himself again. He then pulled me down and had me lay on him while I cried and proceeded to wipe the tears off of my cheeks. He did this until he had to go, and once he got up, he gave me a very long and tight hug.

We walked downstairs to his car and hugged multiple times, and as he goes to start his car, he goes back for ""one last hug"" and gives me this huge, tight hug. He leaves and then calls me when he got home, and we both fall asleep on the phone.

Now it's been a few days, we're back in school (last week we were on vacation) and sports/clubs are busy again. I feel like he's being hot and cold again. What do I do? Do I try to show him that I'd do anything to get him back? That I want it to work? I'm just a loss. Any advice would help.",1,1746156821.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

• Papua New Guinea Arabica Southern Highlands 

• Peru Café del Valle Region: Utcubamba & Luya Altitude: 2,300 meters 

• Arabica Brazil Catuai (lcatu) Region: Santos, Brazil Altitude: 1,200 meters

Subways and buses in Korea are really quiet. Even if you're with friends, people tend to speak softly or not at all. I learned this the hard way when a grandma gave me a silent death stare.

**2. There are trash cans... nowhere**  
Seriously. Don’t expect to find public trash bins easily. People take their trash home, especially for things like coffee cups or snack wrappers. Bring a small plastic bag in your backpack — lifesaver.

**3. You don’t need to tip**  
In fact, if you leave money at a table, the staff might run after you to return it. No need to calculate 10–20%. The price you see is what you pay.

**4. Take your shoes off indoors**  
If you’re entering someone’s home, a traditional restaurant with floor seating, or even some guesthouses, removing shoes is expected. Look around — if there’s a shoe rack, you know the deal.

**5. Respect your elders (even with body language)**  
A simple two-hand gesture when giving/receiving something (like money or a drink), or even a slight nod can go a long way. It’s subtle but appreciated.

**6. Bring pocket Wi-Fi or a SIM with data**  
Free Wi-Fi exists in places like cafes, but Google Maps is limited for walking directions. Having local data helped me use WayKo Map, Naver Map, KakaoMap, and even translate signs in real time.

**7. Don’t expect everyone to speak English, but people will try to help**  
Younger Koreans might speak some English, but don’t assume. A smile, a translation app, and a little patience always worked for me. Also — Papago > Google Translate in Korea.

**Bonus Tip**: Korean convenience stores are amazing. You can survive off triangle kimbap, hot packs, and banana milk alone.",0,1746156722.0,koreatravel,8,0.49,False

According to my doctors, we dont absorb nutrients as well and dont excrete them as well either, so its easy for calcium oxalate to build up in kidneys, causing stones. Drink lots of water folks, having dozens of GI ulcers was NOTHING compared to kidney stone pain and from having emergency surgery. My doc recommended 3 liters a day of water for prevention, as well as limit caffeine (more so energy drinks than coffee), soda, and other foods high in calcium oxalate. Some foods like lemon, vinegar, cheese, and citric acids can help prevent/break down stones.

hi, this feels like such a tiny thing to post about... but this morning I measured the oat milk for my coffee **and it was so easy.**

Previously, I was really against calorie counting for myself because of previous experiences with MyFitnessPal. I've managed to slowly lose the weight and maintain ~170 for months without calorie counting. But after an experience last week where I felt so hungry that I ended up eating almost an entire pizza (proud of myself for not doing the whole thing) I realized... it's time to make sure I'm eating enough. So I started yesterday. And it was hard.

But today was so much easier! After the frustration of having to guesstimate yesterday's breakfast, I decided to just... measure my oat milk. And guess what?? Not only was it easy... the recommended serving size (100ml) was the perfect amount. I even have the perfectly sized Moomin measuring cup for it that I bought in Japan. This is going to be a fun and easy routine to have.

Before, I was really against measuring things like this... thinking I'd feel restricted or burdened by ""measuring every single little thing."" But a post by a user on here about lazy tracking, calorie counting from a harm-reduction angle... really changed my life. Like, it's *okay* if I'm not tracking perfectly as long as I make sure I'm eating real food. I can measure the oat milk. Maybe next I'll start measuring oils! ",5,1746156584.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

He was a mess when I met him. He spent his days passed out by the river, depressed, JojaMart wage slave and all that jazz. I have a soft spot for broken things/people and I thought “I’m already fixing my farm, so why not fix him too?”. This was my biggest mistake. 

After a few months he (kinda) sobered up, and we got married. He filled my pets’ bowls with water, watered the crops sometimes and even adopted a blue chicken for me. Initially I thought it was sweet and that I was actually fixing him. 

But he just… stopped trying. He quit his job at Joja, which I supported, but then he either just stayed inside all day or went to the Saloon. I’d come home exhausted from Skull Caverns, and he’d gift me yet another soggy-ass, room-temp pizza. No dinner, no chores, no affection. Just existential dread and dairy. Not to mention his room in our home was absolutely disgusting! 

The final straw? I got us tickets to watch a movie and I was so excited! Once we got there, I bought him the most deliciously expensive snack available (truffle fries which cost me 180 coins) to give him a nice treat… you know what he did? DIDN’T EVEN TOUCH THEM! 

So I divorced him. It was not about the money, it was about the ungrateful atitude! There and then I realised I couldn’t fix him and we were not meant for each other. After divorcing him, I’ve tried to remain friends but he is avoiding me. Now, if I try to talk to him he just tells me to leave him alone as if I’m the villain here! 

But then… After the divorce I started talking to Elliott. Yes, the the red haired man who lives in a cabin full of books and sea breeze. I immediately developed feelings for him, he’s perfect. He cooks, he writes his books, makes me coffee in the morning, helps around AND his room really matches the vibe of the rest of the house! He calls me his “muse.” We just had a baby together and he’s the love of my life. 

So yeah: I divorced Shane and married Elliott. Shane now lives back in Marnie’s spare room, brooding and drinking again (probably). I do feel bad… but also not really? I just wanted someone who would actually participate in the relationship and appreciate me.

We connected very well and easily and had a lot in common (granted we were drunk). We probably spent the rest of the night talking. The only catch is that she doesn’t live in the same city… hours away, but she comes here often (don’t ask me how this keeps happening to me😂). Anyways I shot my shot before going home and asked her if she wanted to grab coffee before she headed back home the next day (was here visiting sibling). The date was confirmed. The rest of that same night she was texting me how cute she thought I was and interested she was in me, etc. 

Fast forward to the next morning I woke up with the night being blurry, but remember almost all of it. I remember our conversation being so enjoyable and pleasant that it prompted me to buy flowers for this first date, something I have NEVER done. It was like this little cup of small flowers that the gas station sells. Nothing crazy at all. The flowers were received extremely positively from her. She even said it was the sweetest gesture a guys has ever done for her. Anyways, the date went very well I thought for two hungover folks. Conversation was very easy and natural, almost felt refreshing with how much we had in common. After the date ended she headed back home and we texted for some time after the date right away and she even asked for my instagram. I thought I killed the date. 

Later in the texts I asked if she had ever been to this one spot in my town, and she said she hadn’t. I told her that next time she’s here (she is coming back next week and we both expressed on the date we’d wanna hang again) we will have to fix that. That was 3 days ago and I have not gotten a response since that message. This is why I feel like I am being ghosted. Am I over thinking, or did I mess up somewhere? I honestly feel lost because of much affirmation was being said from her early on but maybe it’s just the liquor talking sometimes.

# Baristina Espresso Machine: 2025's Best? Review & Guide

The Baristina Espresso Machine is a state-of-the-art appliance designed to bring caf茅-quality espresso into the comfort of your home. This machine is not just about brewing coffee; it's about crafting an experience. It caters to both novice and experienced espresso enthusiasts, offering a blend of simplicity and advanced features.

[[Browse top-rated baristina espresso machine on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=baristina+espresso+machine)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The Baristina Espresso Machine offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall performance and user experience.

**Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:** The Baristina features a built-in conical burr grinder with adjustable grind settings.

This allows users to freshly grind their coffee beans just before brewing, maximizing flavor extraction and aroma. The grinder is designed with hardened steel burrs for consistent grinding and long-term durability. Users can select from a range of grind sizes, from coarse to fine, to tailor the espresso to their preference and bean type.

**Precision Temperature Control (PID):** The machine incorporates a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) temperature controller for stable water temperature.

This ensures that the water is consistently heated to the optimal temperature for espresso extraction, typically around 200掳F (93掳C). Maintaining a stable temperature is crucial for preventing under-extraction or over-extraction, resulting in a balanced and flavorful espresso shot every time. The PID system dynamically adjusts the heating element to compensate for temperature fluctuations, providing enhanced temperature stability.

**High-Pressure Pump (20 Bar):** The Baristina utilizes a 20-bar high-pressure pump.

This pump forces hot water through the finely ground coffee at the ideal pressure for extracting the rich flavors and aromas. While a 9-bar pressure is technically the optimal pressure for espresso extraction, the machine uses a 20-bar pump with an internal regulator to ensure consistent 9-bar extraction. This ensures adequate pressure is available even with variations in coffee grind and tamping pressure.

**Automatic Milk Frothing System:** It includes an automatic milk frothing system with adjustable foam levels.

This system allows users to create perfectly frothed milk for lattes and cappuccinos with ease. The machine automatically steams and froths the milk to the desired consistency, eliminating the guesswork and mess associated with manual frothing methods. Users can customize the foam level, from a light microfoam to a thick, creamy froth, to suit their individual preferences.

**Programmable Shot Volume:** Users can program the machine to dispense precise amounts of espresso.

This feature ensures consistency and convenience, allowing users to easily replicate their favorite espresso recipes. The machine can be programmed to dispense single or double shots, and the volume can be adjusted in small increments to achieve the desired strength and flavor. This eliminates the need to manually stop the extraction process, ensuring consistent results every time.

Key features of the Baristina Espresso Machine include:
    * Integrated conical burr grinder
    * Precision temperature control (PID)
    * High-pressure pump (20 bar)
    * Automatic milk frothing system
    * Programmable shot volume

 ## Core Benefits

**Consistent Espresso Quality:** The Baristina Espresso Machine ensures a consistent espresso quality compared to manual or semi-automatic machines. The integrated grinder and PID temperature control work in tandem to deliver predictable results every time. Users report a noticeable improvement in flavor consistency, which translates to a more enjoyable coffee experience.

**Simplified Workflow:** With its automatic features, the machine streamlines the espresso-making process by eliminating the need for manual grinding, tamping, and frothing. This simplifies daily routines and frees up valuable time for users. It means users can enjoy caf茅-quality drinks without the complexity and learning curve associated with traditional espresso machines.

**Customizable Beverage Options:** Despite its ease of use, the Baristina offers a high degree of customization. Users can adjust the grind size, shot volume, and milk frothing level to tailor their drinks to their exact preferences. This provides a level of control that is typically found only in higher-end espresso machines, allowing users to experiment and create their own signature coffee creations.

**Reduced Waste and Cost:** The integrated grinder helps reduce coffee waste by grinding only the amount needed for each shot. This contributes to long-term cost savings by minimizing coffee consumption.

**User-Friendly Design:** The intuitive interface and clear LCD screen make the machine easy to operate and program, even for beginners. The removable water tank and drip tray simplify cleaning and maintenance, ensuring the machine remains in optimal condition.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is the Baristina Espresso Machine compatible with different types of coffee beans?**
Yes, it's fully compatible with most types of coffee beans, including light, medium, and dark roasts. The adjustable grind settings allow you to fine-tune the grind size to optimize extraction for different bean types. However, oily beans are not recommended as they can clog the grinder.

**How difficult is the cleaning process?**
Cleaning typically takes about 5-10 minutes for daily maintenance and around 30 minutes for a deep clean. Most parts are dishwasher safe, and the included manual provides clear step-by-step instructions. Descaling the machine is recommended every 2-3 months, depending on water hardness.

**What is the warranty coverage?**
The product comes with a 2-year warranty covering manufacturing defects and component failures. This includes repairs or replacements of defective parts but excludes damage caused by misuse, neglect, or improper cleaning. Extended warranty options may be available.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee with this machine?**
While the machine is designed to be used with freshly ground beans for optimal flavor, it does have a bypass option for pre-ground coffee. However, using pre-ground coffee will not deliver the same level of flavor and aroma as freshly ground beans.

1kcr1um,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1kcr1um/sugar_free_for_2_years/,Sugar free for 2 years.,"Refined sugar of course. I still eat fruits. Besides that, no other sweetener. I started when I was 17.

I'm going to be real. During this time, I have tried sugar a couple times by accident (probably 2-3), in very small amounts. The thing is everywhere. But it wasn't deliberately, that urge went away in just 1-2 months when I started.

I used to be a person who consumed a lot of sugar (energy drinks almost daily, sweets, junk food in general too).

The day I started it wasn't progressively or anything, I just woke up and said, oh well no sugar anymore. And I stuck with it. I don't think I have any eating disorders, but I do not particularly like eating all that much either. I just meet my daily calories and get it over with, never under or over eating.

As soon as I had a clean diet and no sugar my skin cleared and I had much more energy. I also quit coffee at the same time. I still have insomnia though.

I do not feel like I'm losing out on anything, there are many better things to eat than sugar. I'm not a picky eater, and there aren't many foods I dislike either. I'll eat anything that I consider to benefit my diet.

Many people say they would not have the willpower to do all this, but in reality, that's not how I see it at all. I'm just choosing what I eat and what I don't. For me, it was that simple.

I think honestly the hardest part was people around me ticking off what I did as ""weird"". With enough time, some of those same people started eating way less sugar and even tending more towards alternatives like honey. Just because they saw me change my diet, I'm glad I got to influence others in some way. Maybe it was their own insecurities at first. Who knows?

Just sharing a perspective. It doesn't have to be hard to quit. But after enough time, your body surely adapts. Thinking about things with tons of sugar now makes me feel a bit disgusted.",7,1746155225.0,sugarfree,4,1.0,False

In the almost year since then, I’ve lost a total of 120lbs (starting weight 307, day of 295, current 187) and while it feels amazing, I’m terrified. I hear so many people say restriction lessens at a year, and that old habits come back hard. I’m trying so hard to plan and approach things to make sure that doesn’t happen. I have an almost 2.5 year old and he’s one of the big reasons I had surgery. But I find myself putting myself last often, grazing instead of having focused meals, surviving on protein coffee and a cheese stick for hours because I’m busy entertaining him or taking care of him. I want and need to be more focused on planning and tracking. I spent a large portion of my life pre op meticulously tracking my food intake, so I’ve been reluctant to track anything but protein since my surgery. I am working with a dietician but I still struggle daily with eating too fast, or not getting enough water. I know everyone’s journey isn’t linear, and no one is the same…I’m just so scared of “failing” myself and not living up to the compliments people have given me since losing weight (which is so weird and feels awful, at times, to even be acknowledged in this way/for this reason)

What are some phrases you have ready to go in these cases?

Hi everyone I read this sub a lot but don't think I've posted on it. My in-laws aren't the worst, but every now and then they overstep. The first time MIL majorly overstepped I used a lot of the advice I read on other people's posts on how to handle it.

The first time MIL majorly overstepped was when she yelled at us for not wanting to send a million elopement announcements to everyone on her christmas card list (we eloped in July and she had been holding my husband's family's mailing addresses hostage). After the incident I was adamant we have a serious conversation with her and that she needed to apologize. My husband wanted to just let it go because ""thats just how my mom is"" and ""she's crazy"" but ultimately i convinced him we couldn't ignore something like this. When we did eventually sit down with her and get an apology she pulled the whole ""I'm sorry for yelling at you but you guys never respond to my text messages."" I knew she wasn't completely taking ownership for her actions but it was a step in the right direction, and my husband did have a habit of forgetting to respond. We accepted her apology and carried on as before. That was about a year and a half ago.

I knew that when I got pregnant, they would be on an information diet. We waited until I was in the second trimester, came over to their house, cooked them dinner, and presented them with a champagne bottle with custom label on it (baby last name coming soon). It's their first grandchild so they were very excited. MIL was actually very well behaved and didn't press me for information or pressure me about anything like she had with our wedding/elopement plans. We told them repeatedly that they were not to tell ANYONE. They were the first people we told (other than my boss and best friend) and we were very clear that we wanted to share the news and had a plan to do so when we were ready. Anyway we have dinner, husband, MIL, and FIL drink the champagne and after dinner my husband suggested we play a board game and leaves the table to get one. This is where it all goes wrong.

FIL proceeds to try to get the perfect picture of the bottle and label. MIL reminded him not to send it to anyone, he doesn't respond. Husband walks back into the room, and FIL says ""Aunt says congratulations."" Immediately everyone's jaws drop. MIL is hurling insults at FIL, my heart is racing, husband is in shock, BIL(16) is asking who did you send the picture to. The evening is ruined, husband and I leave and figure out damage control on the drive home. FIL had sent the picture to his 4 siblings, and we wanted to make sure the news didn't make it to my husband's grandparents because we wanted to be the ones to tell them.

That was about 3 weeks ago. Husband and I have decided on what boundaries/rules will be put in place, and plan to have coffee with ILs in a public place to establish them. Even though FIL is the one who messed up here some of the rules are directly related to MILs behavior and she will take things personally. My husband expects her to say things like ""well I guess I'm just a terrible mom"" and to complain about things we do or don't do. 

What are some phrases I can rehearse for when she says these things?

For example, she will try to excuse FILs behavior by saying he was intoxicated. I plan to say something like ""FIL is a large man who drinks regularly. 2 glasses of champagne in an hour with dinner would not have impaired his judgement. He waited until husband left the room to take the picture and send it. He knew what he was doing.""

I also just want to note that there have been several incidents with MIL especially in regards to our wedding. I only bring up the Christmas card incident because it was the worst thing that she did and it highlights how we handled it and her type of responses.

1kcquya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kcquya/my_boyfriend_accidentally_threw_away_my/,My boyfriend accidentally threw away my medications.,"We just moved to a new country. It's really hard to get my medications covered and I've had issues every step of the way. They won't refill a majority of them because of my dosage, what they just don't carry, what insurance won't cover, but they wouldn't even look at my insurance information because it's on a document that people keep refusing to read. It’s on an identity document literally one inch to the left of a photograph of my face. I had to pay $140 for an appointment two months ago, and they only filled ONE of my medications. Then, I was told by my case management that everyone should accept that paper, and it is my  insurance paper, and they shouldn't have charged me for it.

I am on two medications to treat Bipolar 1. I was diagnosed 12 years ago. They also won't refill my adderall perscription. I have CPTSD and nightmares that are treated with a sleep aid. I have been on these medications for many years and stable.

I was taking the empty bottles to an appointment to try to have them refilled again. I had been rationing my medications for months, hoarding them before moving, taking doses that are too low, and going through hell because of it. I've had volatile moods and experiencing mania and hypomania, and paused using the adderall because of it.

I had about one week of one medication left. I had 3 weeks of the other, because I halved my dose to try to sustain it because of how hard it's been to get any help at all. I had 8 adderall left because I had only been taking them when going to hearings, or meetings, or something I need to be more functional and attentive for. I had 2 weeks of the sleep aid. I'd been taking half doses of everything and just trying to keep it together until I could go back to full doses when I could consistently get refills. 

I put my medications in a cup, with them divided by napkins and wrapped, to make sure they were safe, so I'm not carrying my few remaining meds and walking around. 

I told my boyfriend. ""I put my medications in a cup on the counter in the kitchen so I'm not hauling them around.""

I finished getting ready. I cleaned up after our dog. I put the dog matter into the trash can and prepared to pull the trash. 

I looked, and the cup was empty. My heart dropped. I asked him if he threw away my meds. 

He did. I broke down. I had a panic attack. I immediately tried to dig through the bag while sobbing. Of course, it's full of dog shit and a dripping piss pad. He started to dig through it. He ""saved"" a few of my loose meds as I wept and asked if he could save any more. They're pills, so of course they fell to the bottom and into wet coffee grounds. 

I look. They're covered in dog piss and coffee grounds. He puts them in the cup, and they're all melted and fucked up, and the adderall has turned into wet dust. I have the worst panic attack I've had in years. I break down. I cry. 

We go to try to get my meds refilled and I'm shut down. They won't do it. Again, refusing to read my very clear insurance information. 

I successfully get one partially refilled because I connect with the doctor, and let her know they're technically seizure medication thay can cause withdrawals. I have a history of seizures and aneurysms in my family. They called around to the insurance. I ended up badgering them for over an hour, and they eventually broke and partially filled two. I come back home and break down because they didn't return any of my papers.

I have to go back. I really harp on that seizure part. They refill one bottle entirely. I go home and I'm still crushed, and defeated, and broken, and crying. And he's upset too, of course. I don't want to blame him for an accident, but that was ALL of my medications. For months. Our circumstances means I'm at the mercy of a system that is no way in my favor.

He was out of medications for ONE day, a few weeks ago. And he got to go in, and they were covered and refilled. No fight. No begging. No payment. 

I'm charged 30 dollars for a signature and they can't fill them. There's a rehab center next door and they won't fill my adderall in case I decide to walk outside and sell them in the parking lot. Now, why in the fuck would I do that?

Now, predictably, it's tense with my boyfriend. It's an accident, and I got some of my meds partially refilled. You can't just stop medications like that cold turkey, especially in an already scary and volatile situation. 

I think anyone with a mental illness, limited access to their medication, with nothing, would break down. My wailing of ""oh my god,"" and sobbing was taken personally. I shouldn't have yelled. I didn't yell at him, but being panicked, I was loud and in distress. 

I'm devastated. I'm scared. I'm hurt. It was not an intentional betrayal, but it was EVERYTHING. It was every one of my medications. Getting to refill any of them was like pulling teeth. I had to stand there and, one by one, be told they won't dispense my medications. 

And that's all I could do. I'm sad and hurt and scared. My medications are the last line of defense on my cracking psyche. I can hope and pray and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and cross my fingers and knock on wood, but they doesn't mean that there couldn't be very dangerous consequences for abruptly not having any of my medications. What if they wouldn't refill any of them? What if the clinic was closed? What if they charged me $300 and I'd have to tuck my tail and tell them I can't afford that? Because that's what nearly happened when I had to pay $140 last time. 

I'm looking for a therapist. I'm looking for a psychiatrist. I'm trying to keep it together, and get back into mental health treatment, and get help. We're rental hopping with no money left. I can't do anything else about it, except accept my fate of being perpetually punched down on by the world.

I go to work on time, wear modest clothes, and make small talk with coworkers like I have nothing to hide. But as soon as the door closes behind me and I’m alone with him… I’m not even close to the same person.

We don’t label it. He’s not my boyfriend. He’s not even someone I see that often in public. But when I get that “you’re coming over tonight” text, I already know what I’m in for — and I never say no.

He has rules. I wear what he tells me. I kneel when he says so. I’ve been blindfolded, restrained, even gagged. One time he made me keep a little toy in while we went out for drinks, and I had to sit there and act completely normal while he held the remote in his pocket — teasing me under the table.

He calls me his “filthy little secret,” and I am. No one would believe how submissive I become the moment he touches me. I crave the humiliation. I love that no one would guess how depraved I really am when I’m bent over for him, begging for permission to come.

I go back to work the next day like nothing happened — hair tied up, polite smile, coffee in hand — knowing full well I had bruises from the night before and still felt sore in the best way.

Sometimes I wonder what people would think if they saw the videos. But the truth? I hope they never find out. Because this secret life — it’s mine, and I’ve never felt more wanted, more used, or more alive.

1kcqs6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kcqs6j/im_not_my_best_friends_best_friend_and_i_maybe/,I'm not my best friend's best friend and I maybe never was.,"I've made my first reddit account purely because I need to get this out. 

  
I, 18 male, grew up pretty isolated and didn't have close friends for years.  I was pretty quiet and when I did make friends I would normally find out that they were just using me or pity friending me.  Because of this, I'm not good at identifying things within friendships and I don't know how to deal with situations like this.

At the end of my sophomore year of high school I met my friend, who I'll call Rome, 18 male. He was nice to me and seemed genuinely interested in me as a person. At the start of our Junior year I joined his friend group where everyone was kind and accepting. I want to make it clear that I love the people in my friend group and although I am hurt by the situation, I don't blame them.  

After joining the friend group I met someone who I'll call Julian, 19 male. We became really fast friends and he admitted to me that he had also not really made close friends before. I felt like he understood me and with his help, along with Rome and the rest of the group, I grew in confidence and became more outgoing. By summer, me and Julian were talking about living together after high school and I considered him my best friend. I never told him though, I don't really know if that's something you're supposed to do. I was closer to Julian than I'd ever been to anyone. 

  
Side note: I don't want to come off like I abandon Rome. Yes, he brought be to the friend group but we didn't click like I did with Julian. We don't leave him out and I still consider him one of my favorite people, and he knows this. He also has had a best friend since before we ever met and I think his bf is a very cool/kind guy. Rome is OKAY. 

  
At the beginning of our senior year another guy joined the group. Nick, 18 male. Nick was EXTREMELY shy, more shy than I used to be. But Julian and I  through he was really cool and started hanging out with him as trio sometimes and he also came out of his shell. Nick clearly always liked Julian better thought. When I found out they were hanging out one on one I didn't think too much of it. But by the spring semester I started to realize my dilemma. I would ask Julian to hang out and half the time he'd say ""sorry, I'm hanging with Nick."" or ""Nick and I were gonna get coffee, but you're welcome to tag along."" This was also around the time Rome started dating his girl friend. I felt like no one had time for me and was honestly really lonely. (still am.) 

In the summer, me and Julian were working at the same place so I got to see him most days. Summer was actually pretty great as we would hang out after work at least three times a week. Yes, Nick was normally there but, after a six hour shift of goofing off with Julian it wasn't so bad. Also, I do still love Nick. I'm writing this out of frustration but Nick didn't actually do anything wrong and he's still fun to be around.

After summer, some of the friend group moved away due to college leaving only myself, Julian, Rome, and Nick in the same city. 

Me and Rome started to notice that Julian and Nick were kinda turning into the same person. They dressed the same, they talked the same, they listened to the same music. We started joking that they would start dating. So yeahhh....they started dating. They told us A MONTH AFTER. They didn't tell us they were dating for a full month. They started telling everyone their ""perfect love story."" How they had been best friends basically since they first met, how they knew they were meant for each other. This sounds sappy because I'm writing while angry but they really are happy together and I genuinely think they'll get married some day.

At this point in writing this I don't know what my objective is. I just hate that everyone is choosing other people above me. I hate that no one has seemed to notice how this would hurt me. I've talked to Rome a bit about it and he knows that I don't like that their best friends but other than that I've kept it to myself. I'm just so angry that I can't blame anyone but myself. I can't make people choose me. 

And yes, I know the answer is probably just to tell them how I feel. I just can't seem too. I know how guilty they would feel and don't want everyone to feel as bad as me. I'm just heartbroken and angry and theres nothing I can do about it.

I don't know where I went wrong. I think I'm an enjoyable person to be around. I think I'm a good friend. 

literally any advise would help. I'm clearly doing something wrong when it comes to friendships. I've had failed friendships before but I could always blame them(seriously, one of them was a shit person)

Need to run a scenario by y'all and get your advice. I'm a 1L (first year) law student who recently asked and went on a coffee ""date"" with a 3L.
 A little back story before getting into the date itself. The girl I went on a date with was my bailiff at my oral arguments. we talked briefly before and after that in-person but it was all regarding the arguments itself. After that we glanced at each other at our annual law school prom and on the elevator once. Then, I randomly decided to ask her to a date via email just by searching her law school email. I opened by saying I think she was my bailiff, but more importantly, that I was interested in learning about her experience in the peer-to-peer mentoring program. (Mostly BS) After a few days she actually got back to me and accepted the offer to get coffee. The ""date"" itself went great and lasted for about 40 minutes, after the beginning, most our topics didn't cover the peer program but went to a lot of small talk about our lives before law school and where we grew up. (A silly observation since this is how most convos go but the eye contact was pretty intense, even when we were standing close to each other getting our coffeee) 
At the end I asked for her phone number so I could ""follow up with her if I had any questions about the law review in the future"" she gladly gave me her phone and number but said that she would text me (although as she said that I texted myself on her phone). We then said our goodbyes. 
So I initially thought that her saying she would text me was a sign she was romantically interested. But then I thought that it could actually of been setting professional boundaries. I think I've said the same thing to people I don't want to text before. 
Final details: even though she is a upper classman, we are the same age. We are also probably in the same league but she is a bit more charismatic than I am. 

So my question is, was this purely a professional date? Or something more? It's also important to note that the peer program is pretty trivial at the law school and this is actually a busy time because finals are next week. This makes it noteable that she actually accepted the coffee invitation.

Thanks for your help on this!

1kcqoxt,https://i.redd.it/bjfhvesf6aye1.jpeg,Sunset Van Camp Honest Review,"Now that I am recovered from W2, I thought I should give an honest review of the new Sunset Van Camp pre-set van camping option. Me and my friends booked this pretty last minute (group of 4 of us). Some have been to Coachella 9 times, 1 it was his first! 

Anyways, here's the review for anyone who may look into this for 2026...Worth every penny. 

The van itself is fully prepped when you arrive - clean sheets, a crazy comfortable bed w/ 4 pillows, a duvet, fans, a large window AC unit cranking at 65 degrees, utensils, plates, coffee mugs, cups, coozies, stove w/ water boil (late night ramen saved me every night at 3am), a full size cooler, camp chairs. Literally, I am not sure what they didn't think of in these vans. The company that provides the van is called Moterra. I looked up their website and what you get at Coachella is exactly what you get if you book on their site (and I think more based on what we had available to us). 

Bathrooms: private AC bathrooms only for the campers in the village meant extremely clean bathrooms. These were a lifesaver.

Lounge area: They have a lounge area where me and my friends were able to decompress after a long day for like 3 hours. Listening to music and having some drinks and unwinding. More campers camp to join and it was like a little after party of 15-20 of us. Super chill and fun. 

Security: There was always a sunset van camp ""staff"" member (the owners of the van company, moterra) and security at the front. I knew my shit wasn't going to get stolen, so that's a plus. Either way, they have an app where you lock the van. So it's not like you have to carry around a key. Which is great because I would have lost it 100%. 

Sleeping: Bed 5 stars. AC cranking to the point I was cold AF and had to sleep with pants and a top on because I refused to turn off the AC lol. Blackout curtains/shades on all windows. I was able to sleep until my heart desired (which was pretty damn late every day). 

Location: unbeatable. 1.5 minute walk to the entrance. 

Cons: TBH i really can't think of one. Maybe the fact that I ubered and got dropped off and had to wheel my bags to camp, but I think that's my own fault and not that big of a deal honestly. 

Other con: i can't find it on the site yet.. Hoping it comes back.",20,1746154063.0,Coachella,17,0.92,False

He frankly was never a great partner (lost my favorite copy of my favorite book when he was on vacation, never bothered to ask any questions about my family or friends when I had been doing the same thing for him the entire time, peed himself while black out drunk in my apartment foyer making me clean it up. yelled at me when I almost slipped into a diabetic coma at his apartment after he wanted me to come over because he was scared of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, never thanked me when I would buy him food, etc), and was an alcoholic. No abuse, he just wasn’t a great person and had a lot of issues and after the yelling at me, coma thing, I ended everything, and we had only talked maybe one or two times since then.

He was a minor (self described as “vaguely anonymous”) celebrity in my city, known as a banksy-esque street artist who got to travel to different cities for art shows, even released one - maybe two - coffee table books. He has some murals on buildings throughout the city and it’s been weird seeing them and knowing that now he’s gone, and knowing that we knew each other while he was here.

I have some photos and videos in my phone from times that we had been together in the past and I look back on those memories I have stored in my phone fondly. Rereading our text thread feels so strange, knowing that the gray blocks of text are from a person that I will never text again, even though iMessage is still enabled, I wanted to send something to the number We had a lot of fun together and I’d always hoped that he would get a handle on the drinking and get his life together and we could become friends again sometime in the future, and it somber knowing that his life was cut so short from the reliance on alcohol.

# Main Content: The Best IPTV Norway Service Provider I’ve Found (And Why You’ll Love It Too)

Hey there, fellow streamer! If you're tired of paying insane prices for cable TV or dealing with buffering issues on sketchy IPTV services, I’ve got some great news for you. After testing *way* too many IPTV subscriptions (some good, some… let’s just say I demanded a refund), I finally found the **best IPTV service** for Norway—and honestly, it’s a game-changer.

Here’s the deal: I wanted **affordable, high-quality streaming** with no freezing, a massive channel list, and VOD (movies & shows) that actually works. Oh, and sports—because missing a big match? Not an option. After *extensive* research (and a few late-night binge-watching sessions), I narrowed it down to a few top contenders.

But before we dive in, let me ask you:

Good news: The **best IPTV subscription** in Norway solves *all* of that.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What makes IPTVGREAT the best IPTV service in Norway?**  
Great question! IPTVGREAT stands out because of its massive library (140,000+ live channels and 100,000+ VOD options), ultra-stable servers with Anti-Freeze tech, and affordable pricing ($14/month). Plus, it’s been my personal go-to for three years—zero buffering, even during peak hours!

**2. Is IPTV legal in Norway?**  
IPTV itself is legal, but *content access* depends on licensing. Always choose reputable providers like IPTVGREAT, IPTVFOLLOW, or IPTVUNLOCK, which prioritize licensed streams. Avoid sketchy services offering ""too good to be true"" deals—they often violate copyright laws.

**3. Will IPTV work on my smart TV or Fire Stick?**  
Absolutely! The best IPTV providers support all devices, including Smart TVs, Fire Sticks, Android/iOS, and even laptops. IPTVGREAT even offers 24/7 support to help with setup—just download their app or use a player like IPTV Smarters.

**4. How does IPTVGREAT compare to cable TV?**  
Cable TV can’t compete! For a fraction of the price, you get way more channels (including international and premium sports), on-demand content, and no long-term contracts. Oh, and did I mention *zero buffering* with Anti-Freeze tech?

**5. What’s the best IPTV subscription for sports fans?**  
If live sports and PPV events are your jam, IPTVUNLOCK is a beast (check out [iptvunlock.com](https://iptvunlock.com)). But IPTVGREAT also delivers 4K sports streams—perfect for Premier League, NFL, or UFC fights.

**6. Can I try before I buy?**  
Most top providers offer trials or money-back guarantees. IPTVGREAT occasionally runs free trials—keep an eye on their site ([iptvgreat.me](https://iptvgreat.me)) or ask their support team.

**7. Why does some IPTV buffer or freeze?**  
Usually, it’s due to weak servers or overcrowded networks. That’s why I recommend providers like IPTVGREAT—their Anti-Freeze tech and stable servers eliminate this issue. Also, check your internet speed (at least 25 Mbps for HD).

**8. How do I pay securely for an IPTV subscription?**  
Stick to providers with trusted payment gateways (PayPal, credit cards). Avoid sketchy sites asking for crypto or bank transfers. IPTVRESALE ([iptvresale.com](https://iptvresale.com)) even offers secure reseller plans if you want to start your own business.

**9. Can I share my IPTV subscription with family?**  
Most providers allow multiple simultaneous streams (IPTVGREAT offers 2-5 depending on the plan). Just confirm their policy—some limit by IP address to prevent abuse.

**10. What’s the best IPTV provider for 2025?**  
Based on reliability and updates, IPTVGREAT still leads the pack for 2025. But IPTVFOLLOW is a close second for binge-watchers, with insane VOD updates. Both keep improving their servers and content libraries yearly!

I've been offered a SM job from Starbucks to be placed in 1 of the many new locations opening in my area. Currently a SM for a large retail corporation and have been for well over 5 years leading stores with a yearly revenue of 6-10 Million. 

While i do not possess previous coffee house experience i am eager to learn and although an SM i am a very apparent and supportive leader to my team.  Looking for insight on the in's and out's of the day to day.

\-What do you feel as a Barista, Shift Supervisor, ASM you need from an SM to feel supported and buy in to the culture and day to day operations?

\-In previous SM's how much bar time do you see them doing? -On the flip side of that- How much bar time would you like to see them doing?

\-New leadership can be scary and intimidating. What helps soften that for you so that you feel motivated to do your best and help with transition?

\-Do you feel starbucks is a generally good place to work? I recognize that there have been significant changes as of recently but zooming out and looking at the wide scope, what rating out of 10  would you give it? If possible please explain the reasoning behind the rating.

  
Thank you all in advance!

Just trying to get as much info to make an informed decision and if accepted be the best leader for and with my team.",3,1746152777.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

**Sam’s Road Trip:**

Sam isn’t sure when the new neighbour moved in but he remembers clearly the first time he saw the ’67 Camaro with California plates gleaming in the driveway. The candy apple red paint defiant against the early-spring grey and beige of the suburban neighbourhood. Nobody ever saw it leave but they heard it prowling through the neighbourhood, perhaps still on West Coast time.

It takes a week before Sam spots Brad, the tan square-jawed owner. It’s not because he’s hard to spot. On the contrary: he’s blonde with bright white teeth, sculpted muscles, and a meticulously curated style designed to give a laid-back California vibe. Rather it seems as though he went out of his way to not be spotted, nobody ever saw him. Nobody except Sam. Sam who had the place staked out.

Of course Sam had seen classic cars before. Usually they were hobby projects for weekend drives and Tuesday night shows, the slushy salt-encrusted Canadian streets being no place for such a flamboyant antique. Truth be told he wasn’t even that interested in old cars but there was something different about this one. It was Dave who suggested that Sam, who’d been thinking of going to school for journalism, do a story on it.

“I’m new here, but are the bushes outside of my house where the neighbourhood kids usually hang out?” Brad finally asks one day.

“Uh, yes. I mean no. I mean, I’m doing a story for the Valley Voice. About your car.”

“Valley Voice? Not sure I’ve heard of that one,” Brad replies cooly.

“I started it myself. I mean, I’m working on starting it. As a blog. I’m thinking about going into journalism.”

“Are we in a valley?”

“The Don Valley. I wanted to name it after local geography, like the Georgia Straight. And a nod to the Village Voice.”

“Huh. Journalism’s a tough gig these days.”

“I think that makes it more important,” Sam replies, completely earnestly.

“Well how can I say no to another writer?”

Sam’s eyes grow wide. “Writer?” He asks.

“Yeah, but I make my stories up. I used to write in Hollywood.”

“Hollywood?!” Sam stammers. “Like movies and stuff?”

“Like movies and stuff,” Brad repeats, folding his thick arms across his broad chest and flashing a Hollywood smile.

“That’s so cool!” Sam fawns.

“I suppose. It’s a tough industry, though. Almost as tough as journalism.”

Sam bursts into the house after their meeting, “You won’t believe what Brad does for a living!”

“Who’s Brad?” Morley asks.

“The car guy!” Sam answers. “He’s a writer in Hollywood!”

“Hollywood? Seems to me he’s a writer in Scarborough,” Dave says.

“Well he’s not in Hollywood now!” Sam replies indignantly.

“I guess that’s true,” Dave says thoughtfully. “Anything we might’ve seen?”

“I didn’t think to ask.”

A week later Sam’s story is finished so he brings it for Brad to review. “Pretty good for a fifteen year-old,” is the verdict.

“Seventeen,” Sam corrects.

“Seventeen? That’s old enough to drive the Camaro.”

“Really?”

“Sure, why not? Let me grab a sweater.” Brad disappears inside the house and emerges in a stylish knit cardigan before tossing Sam the keys.

To Sam’s surprise the car works just the same as any other, except everything is old and manual. Inside it’s dark and worn, well cared for but there’s a split in the dash and nothing quite goes along willingly.

“It’s patina,” Brad says. “It’s got personality.”

They drive slowly around the block before Brad suggests they grab a couple of burgers at the end of the street. Brad points to a parking spot away from the other cars and the two eat leaning on the hood. Sam can’t help but notice how people look and smile, a couple of older men stop by to chat. Sam blushes when Kelsey Wong and Mackenzie Brooks from class wave as they walk past but sits up straighter when he notices how Brad just smiles right back.

It’s a few months later when Sam floats the idea of the road trip. Dave and Carl Lowbeer had been planning a fishing weekend that became two weeks with their wives after Greta and Morley saw where the men were staying. Carl’s friend, a retired mining engineer, owned a lodge on an island up north they were free to use as long as they liked. Sam volunteered to cater the moment he saw the kitchen: it was something he thought only existed on television. The problem was that his employer, Mr. Harmon, needed Sam at the grocery store two days after the others were to leave.

“Maybe we can take a run up in the Camaro,” Brad suggests after Sam complained. “Top down, good music, good food, good views. A little writer’s retreat.”

“Do you know how far it is?” Asks Sam.

“That’s what the Camaro’s for,” Brad replies. “Long road trips in the sun.”

Morley is less concerned with the distance than she is with the driver. “He can’t be more than twenty-five,” she says, later that day.

“He’s twenty-seven,” Sam protests.

“That car has got to be twice as old,” Morley counters.

“You just don’t like him.”

“I don’t…he seems…” Morley falters.

“When Dad was a year older he was touring in old vans with bands. It’s not like it’s a Margaret Atwood story.”

\*\*\*

The round headlights blink on and the engine roars to life well before sunrise on that warm August morning, the smell of gasoline and the artisanal coffee Sam had brought from Mr. Harmon’s and brewed carefully himself wafting on the air. As they pull out of the neighbourhood Brad scrolls around on his phone before his all Bruce Springsteen mix booms from the speakers. It doesn’t take long until they’re cruising up highway four-hundred in the first light of dawn watching the southbound commuter traffic already piling up.

In Barrie Brad pulls into a generic specialty coffee chain where he and Sam stow the convertible top. Brad then heads for the store, stopping halfway and pointing back at Sam, suggesting more coffee. Sam replies that he still has some, thanks, and Brad claps his hands together saying something about fuelling up for a great day. He returns with two large cups of burnt-tasting coffee. There’s no cup holders so Sam holds the hot coffee between his thighs while he finishes the one he brought.

Urban sprawl gives way to farms which give way to deciduous forest as the growling engine propels them northward into the granite and pine of the Canadian shield. In Huntsville Sam asks if maybe they could play some Broken Social Scene and Brad says he can do one better before putting on Bat Out of Hell. In North Bay Brad stops at another coffee chain and returns with two more large cups. By now Sam’s ears are droning, his body is buzzing, and he’s getting a sunburn so he asks to put the top up. Brad replies that this is what the car is made for and what Californians live for before gunning the engine and passing the truck ahead of them.

They stop for lunch at a converted train station in an ex-lumber town. Sam’s ears are ringing after the engine is finally silenced and his skin feels crispy, he’s jittery from all the coffee. The town is quiet and smells of freshwater lakes and pine, a combination of crumbling company town relics and rustic independence. Sam waves Brad ahead, needing a moment to collect his thoughts. He sits on the curb in front of the car and holds his head, massaging his scalp. The gleaming paint is spattered in bugs and Sam feels like he must be too. He notices a fat pink wound in the front driver-side wheel arch where a thick chunk of body filler has freed itself from a shoddy repair job.

Inside Brad has found a seat and is charming the waitress. There’s two bottles of beer on the table. When Brad sees Sam he waves him over and introduces the woman, a rugged thirty-something. An indigenous girl not much older than Sam is wearing a green smock at the cash, rolling her eyes at the flirtations as she chews gum and reads a book. The restaurant is empty, save for the four of them.

“Did you know there’s a chunk missing out of your car?” Sam asks when the waitress moves on.

“Whereabouts?” Brad asks, unconcerned.

Sam explains.

“Ah, yeah, it’s been like that for a while. Character.”

Sam doesn’t say much as the two eat their lunch but it doesn’t matter because Brad fills the silence with a monologue comparing Ontario, particularly the north, with the virtues of California. When Sam finally questions why Brad left he says that Hollywood is too political but a person of his talent could certainly find a job in the Canadian film industry. Outside he sees the waitress smoking a cigarette and admiring the Camaro so he excuses himself, in case she has any questions.

Sam’s glad for the silence as he watches Brad smile and gesticulate at the waitress from the window. The cashier flops down across from him, slouching. She reaches for Sam’s untouched beer and takes a swig before feigning interest in the label.

“Your friend’s kind of an asshole,” she says, not making eye contact.

“What makes you say that?” Sam asks, wondering which is her preferred reason.

“Well, Kim likes him. That’s usually a good indicator.”

“She certainly seems to,” Sam replies listlessly, watching the two of them flirt.

“It just sucks to sit here and listen to him bash my hometown. Believe me, I know we could be doing better but part of doing better is being your best self and guys like that always want you to be something other than yourself, which is impossible. It’s how they keep the upper hand, and people always listen to the confident guy because they’re insecure. Sure we’re not California, but we’re also not California. Why can’t we be just as cool in our own way?”

Outside Kim is in the passenger seat. The Camaro roars to life and Brad backs it out of the parking spot, bright white smile and aviators glinting in the sun.

“Looks like you might be here for a while,” the girl says.

“He’s probably just taking her around the block,” Sam replies.

“If that’s what the kids are calling it these days.”

The two are quiet for a moment.

“I’m Sam by the way,” he holds out his hand.

She takes it. “Cindy.”

“What are you reading?” Sam points to the book sticking out of the pocket of Cindy’s smock.

“Oh, it’s Stuart McLean. Do you know him?”

Sam says that he doesn’t.

“He died a few years ago but he used to do this show on CBC with musical guests and short stories about this nice family, in Toronto I think? I’m not sure he could make it if he was starting out today, he’s so wholesome and hopeful. People want to be depressed these days. I feel like you can tell different stories about the same reality: hopeful or pessimistic. Stuart McLean covered some really human stuff but he did it so hopefully, you know? I get it, there’s some messed up stuff going on in the world. But I’d still rather have him tell the story. Ha, maybe he could get Margaret Atwood for the tricky stuff.”

\*\*\*

Sam and Cindy talk for nearly an hour, there were no other customers. He tells her all about his upcoming culinary holiday and working at Mr. Harmon’s store. She tells him about growing up in the North and then going away to school, she’s going to be a lawyer. Cindy was only two years older than Sam but it seemed like it could have been fifty. He was smitten. It almost made it hard for him to be angry with Brad since he got to spend more time with her.

“You know there’s a train coming in,” she says.

“You have to go back to work?” He asks.

“No. Well, yes. Not really…I mean you could get on it. It goes right by where you’re headed. It’s Ontario Northland, so it’s not exactly luxury but it’s better than waiting for him.”

Sam thinks about this for a moment. “I’ve never taken the train before.”

“It’s an adventure, then.”

“It’s an adventure,” Sam repeats, thinking it over as he speaks the words. “Alright.”

“Come on, then,” Cindy says and hurries to the cash. “The train’s due any time. It’s a little expensive but if you don’t tell anyone I’ll give you a discount.”

“Alright,” says Sam, following.

The train pulls in just as they got to the cash. “Better hurry,” Cindy says as she hands Sam the ticket.

“Thanks,” Sam replies. “Thanks for everything.”

Cindy smiles and Sam rushes out to the platform. Then he comes running back in.

“I told you to hurry!” She says.

Sam holds out his phone. “I’d like to stay in touch.”

She smiles. “Sure.” Then puts her number into his contacts. She waves to the conductor outside to make sure he waits, and Sam runs back to the platform.",0,1746152559.0,redditserials,0,0.5,False

I work in an org that’s doing some high-impact things right now. During my time here, a full-time (FTE) role opened up on a sister team that aligns really closely with what I’m already doing. I figured, why not take the shot?

I went through all 5 rounds of interviews, plus an additional chat with the hiring manager. Everything felt solid. Then came the news: I didn’t get the role.

Being internal, it was a bit awkward. I still see the team regularly—we share the same office space, even the same kitchen. It’s like running into an ex at every coffee break.

The manager of the team I interviewed with actually set up a 1:1 afterward to talk it through, which I appreciated. He told me, and I’m paraphrasing here:

“Everyone you spoke with—including the bar raiser—felt like you should be an Amazonian. But for this specific role, we were concerned. It’s a high-pressure position with tight timelines. You’d probably have to work unsustainable hours just to keep up and avoid being put on Focus. And if that happened, odds are you’d be out within a year. We think you’re great—we just don’t want to set you up to fail.”

At first, it stung. But reading stories here about how hard it can be once you’re put on Focus—and how quickly things can spiral when your manager doesn’t fully see your value—it really made me reflect.

Maybe being at Amazon without all the stress of an FTE role isn’t the worst thing. I’m still here, still working my role, on my same team, with my same work. Sometimes, the opportunity that passes you by is actually saving you from a much bigger headache",14,1746152548.0,amazonemployees,0,1.0,False
1kcq7wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kcq7wj/did_i_cheat_i_have_extreme_anxiety_and_ocd_so_idk/,Did I cheat? I have extreme anxiety and OCD so idk if it’s that.,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I didn’t hesitate obviously I felt bad for cutting off a friend randomly but I had told him how my bf didn’t like me having guy friends because I had told him about my deceased friend so I think he understood.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Ever feel like your brain switches to zombie mode after lunch? 😴 **That 3 PM slump**... we've all been there, right? It's like the universe just collectively decided that afternoon productivity is *optional*.

So, here’s the deal: I was scrolling through our beloved internet last week, looking for a quick fix for my midday brain fog. (RIP, my endless to-do list 📝) And I stumbled upon **Box Breathing**. Yep, sounds fancy, but trust me, it's just some simple breathing stuff backed by science.

Curiosity > skepticism. 🤓 I decided to test this technique for 7 straight days to see if it could help me dodge the dreaded zombie-brain.

**Here’s the skinny on Box Breathing:**

- **Inhale for 4 seconds,** hold your breath for 4 seconds.  
- **Exhale for 4 seconds,** then hold it out for 4.  
- Repeat. (It’s basically hyper-efficient ventilation with a side of zen yoga vibes.) 🧘‍♂️

**Here’s what happened:**

1. **Day 1**: Mild impatience. 🙃 Felt like an eternity, but hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day.
2. **Day 3**: Hello, **calmer mind**! I swear, I felt a noticeable drop in my stress levels.
3. **Day 5**: That **afternoon energy drain**? Almost non-existent. My brain felt like it had a freshness pack installed.
4. **Day 7**: The habit started to stick. My focus improved, and those mini anxiety spikes? Tamed!

*Why does this work?* Apparently, it’s a cortisol hack! Box breathing combats stress responses our body throws at us like unwanted plot twists, keeping energy levels balanced.

**So, if you're:**

- Constantly hitting refresh on your brain after lunch,
- Desperate to regain even an ounce of focus in the afternoon,

In July 1976, Terri Lynn Ray was fifteen years old. The redheaded girl was described as a free spirit who would pin inspirational notes on her bedroom wall. One of these messages, which read, ""The best things in life aren't free, but the best thing in life is freedom,"" is now etched into Terri's headstone where she is buried in her hometown of Redding, CA.

On Wednesday, July 7, 1976, Terri Lynn Ray returned home after swimming at Clear Creek in Redding with other neighborhood youths. She changed into her blue jeans and football jersey, with a bathing suit underneath, at \~5:30pm. Shortly beforehand she had talked with a friend of hers, Willie Bailey, and they had agreed to meet up at the swimming hole at 8:30pm. According to Terri's mother, Laverne, ""\[Terri\] didn't seem upset at all. She was kidding us about eating a burrito for dinner. There was nothing to me out of the ordinary."" She had told her mother that she was going to meet a friend at the swimming hole, and she was told by her mother to be home by midnight. This was the last time Laverne saw of Terri, as Laverne went out at about 6:45pm; she returned home about five hours later.

Willie Bailey told police that he decided not to go to the swimming hole that night, and that the last time he saw Terri was at the intersection of Canyon Rd and Highway 99 when they parted ways after agreeing to meet up again later. Willie's story, that he went to baseball practice and a party rather than swimming, was confirmed by alibi witnesses.

At about 7:30pm, Terri was last seen by neighborhood friends walking her dog, a shepherd mix named Charlie, away from her home at 1942 Canyon Rd toward Clear Creek. A woman familiar with the area reported driving past the creek at 7:50pm, and established that at the time ""the water was placid and there was no one in sight."" One of Terri's friends, a girl named Carla Benner, reported seeing Terri at the swimming hole at about 8pm talking with a dark-haired, balding man in his 40s. Carla said that she didn't speak with Terri at that time. Another witness, a male, went to the swimming hole at \~9:30pm looking for friends, and also reported that the water was placid and no one was present at the time.

At about 8:10pm five individuals reportedly saw Terri sitting in a medium-sized yellow car -- possibly an El Camino model pickup -- in the parking lot of the Mini Mart, 7200 North Highway 99, with two males and possibly another female, ""on the night before her body was discovered in Clear Creek."" According to one clipping, this was the ""last known sighting"" of Terri before she was killed. However, the witnesses vary in their descriptions and ""don't even agree on the model of auto. Some aren't sure if it was Terri in the car or someone who looked like her.""

When Terri's mother, Laverne, returned to her home at about 11:40pm on July 7, she noticed that Terri's dog Charlie was out of the house. Charlie appeared wet on the legs and bottom of the belly, perhaps from a swim. Also when she returned home, Laverne found a note from Terri inside, stating that some family friends had called at 7:15pm about dinner the following night. According to Laverne, ""There was something wrong with that note. It wasn't signed and Terri always signed a message. She always put 'Love ya, Terri,' or 'see you by 12,' or something."" The message was verified as accurate, ""but it wasn't finished and I had the feeling that someone else had been in the house,"" according to Laverne. A glass of orange juice had been left in an odd place on a bar, and a hand towel in the front bathroom ""was hung in a way that no one in our house hangs a towel.""

Two people, a young boy and girl, reported having visited the creek on a stroll between 11:30 and 11:45pm that night. They left and went home after hearing splashes in the water ""like someone throwing rocks."" According to a detective, ""The splashes could have been something as innocent as fish jumping.""

Terri lived with her mother Laverne, her brother Mike (10yo), and stepfather Gary McGuire. While sources conflict a bit, Terri also seems to have lived with her step-sister Lori (16yo); she also seems to have had a half-sister, Nancy Berry, who lived in San Francisco at the time. Terri's biological father had died in a traffic accident in 1972. When Terri didn't come home by midnight, her family -- Laverne, Mike, Gary, and Lori -- immediately began a search for her. One of the areas they searched was the swimming hole.

On Thursday, July 8, at 1am, two waitresses at a Denny's Restaurant at 735 Market St said they were nearly certain they saw Terri having coffee with an older man, about 40yo. One of the women said she didn't recall any apparent tension between the man and the girl. She also said that she thought it was strange that a young girl was sitting so close to an older man. However, detectives state that these sightings, ""don't tie in with anything else in the case""; same goes for Carla Benner's sighting of Terri talking to an older, balding man at the creek.

At 3am on July 8, Laverne called the Shasta County sheriff's office and reported Terri missing. Laverne said that Terri was always on time, and if she was even a few minutes late that she'd call home. Sheriff's deputies reportedly searched the area around the swimming hole (though when they did this is unclear), but found nothing.

At about noon on July 8, two youths -- Mitch Barsky (19yo) & Linda Canfield (29yo) -- were swimming near the Clear Creek Bridge when they found Terri's body floating in Clear Creek near where it flows under State Route 273 and/or near what was then Highway 99 South. Police promptly responded to the scene.

Terri was originally thought to have been stabbed five or six times, though an autopsy determined that she had been stabbed approximately fifteen (15) times with a knife blade that was about 0.75in wide, though many of the wounds were superficial, and some of them on her hands and arms may have been defensive wounds. She did not have any tissue under her fingernails, indicating that she was unable to scratch her assailant. She also had wounds on her neck, chest, and lower abdomen. Only four of the fifteen total stab wounds were mortal, one being in the neck and the other three in the chest. COD was determined to be deep stab wounds to the chest that punctured both lungs. According to one clipping, ""the differing angles of the wounds lead to 'nothing conclusive.'""

The coroner said that Terri could have been dead 16-18hrs before her body was found, though he emphasized that the estimate was difficult to make because she was in the water so long. A single spot of blood on a rock was found at the scene, though there wasn't enough blood to determine if it was hers. It is uncertain if she was killed at the site, though a couple reports note that there were no signs that she died elsewhere and was moved/dragged to the creek. An autopsy found no signs of sexual assault.

In late September 1976, an 18yo girl named Tina Lynn Crume made statements incriminating herself regarding Terri's murder while under hypnosis. However, investigators found four witnesses who put Crume elsewhere from the murder scene. After several weeks in jail, Crume was released, and murder charges were dropped on/by October 5 1976. The case quickly grew cold from there.

Terri's case was reopened in 2013 when, during their yearly review of the case, investigators realized that some evidence in police custody could now be analyzed using new DNA technology. This evidence was sent for DNA testing; as of December 2024, I have not found anything about the results of this testing. Terri is still listed among the city of Redding's victims of unsolved homicides. A $5,000 reward is available in her case.

What do you think happened to Terri? Who could have killed her and why?
