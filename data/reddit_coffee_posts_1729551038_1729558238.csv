1g95rn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1g95rn6/anybody_interested_in_these_prompts_f4m/,Anybody interested in these prompts? [F4M],"Prompt 1: 

In the bustling heart of Hollywood 1946, Muse A, a charismatic and handsome rising star, finds himself trapped in a cycle of typecast roles. Known for his brooding charm and romantic leads, he yearns for a deeper, more meaningful role that will showcase his true range as an actor. Despite his success, he feels suffocated by the industry’s expectations and longs to break free from the superficiality of fame.
Enter Muse B, a gifted writer brimming with creativity and ambition, yet struggling to carve out her place in the male-dominated film industry. She works as a “paper girl” and coffee runner at the studio, a position far beneath her talents. With her scripts constantly overlooked and her ideas dismissed, she faces the dual challenges of being a woman and a person of color in a world that often marginalizes voices like hers.
Their worlds collide when Muse A stumbles upon one of Muse B’s scripts hidden in the break room. Intrigued by her unique voice and fresh perspective, he feels an immediate connection to her writing. 

Prompt 2:

In the gritty streets of 1930s New York City, Muse A is a disillusioned detective working cases that often lead him into the city's dark underbelly. Haunted by the unresolved murder of his former partner, he keeps everyone at arm's length—until he crosses paths with Muse B.

Muse B is a sultry lounge singer with a captivating voice and secrets of her own. When she approaches Muse A to help her find a missing musician—rumored to be tangled with the mob—he reluctantly agrees. 

Caught in a web of deception, they must confront their pasts and the growing attraction between them. But as they get closer to the truth, Muse A must decide if he can trust Muse B, or if her allure is a deadly trap. 


Prompt 3: 

During a journey, Muse A, a brave knight, protects Muse B, a spirited princess, from an unexpected attack. In the chaos, her frightened fiancé shoves the princess aside, causing the knight to be injured while saving her. The story begins with the princess visiting the knight in his tent, filled with concern and guilt. As they confront the aftermath of the attack.
(Short but you get the point)

And prompt 4:

In a neon-lit metropolis dominated by technology, Muse A is the daughter of a powerful corporate mogul, attending a prestigious party for engineers and innovators. Surrounded by cutting-edge inventions.

Muse B, a talented but underappreciated engineer, is presenting a groundbreaking prototype that has the potential to revolutionize the industry. When Muse A strikes up a conversation with him, she is captivated by his passion and vision, feeling a spark of inspiration amidst the corporate glitter.

So I recently have been dealing with the WORST heartburn of my life, and I was pregnant last year! 

I have been getting chest heaviness, a sore throat, heartburn, hoarseness, the whole nine yards for a month now. I have worked on cutting out many foods, particularly tomatoes that have caused upset. When I get a flare up, the burn lasts for days, sometimes longer. The acid is so brutal it causes hoarseness and this is NOT great as I am a high school choir teacher. 

My doctor prescribed 40 mg of omeprazole but I still get breakthrough reflux, going on the 3rd week at this point. Gaviscon and tums take the edge off but never fully remove the discomfort. 

I THINK this is happening because I live in SoCal and the fires in my area were triggering daily migraines. I was taking 800 mg 2x a day to keep them at bay. It wasn’t long before the GERD symptoms started and now they just won’t stop despite me not taking Motrin for over a month now. I’m miserable. 

My health anxiety has been through the roof and I’m sincerely afraid I’m stuck like this forever. I miss coffee. I miss wine. I want some damn pasta with a tomato in it. 

Any guidance would be appreciated. My health ",1,1729558147.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

My husband turns 50 tomorrow and we are having a big party for him on Saturday (NZ).

I have planned a big cake for him. Bottom tier chocolate mud and top tier coffee and walnut cake (his favourite). I have all the cake assembly organised and drawn a rough plan of the final look for it. 

He is a big hunter so have silicon moulds for trees, stumps, stag heads, mushrooms, pinecones, bark ring for the outside of the cake etc but I'm not 100% sure on the best way to tackle it all. Am I better to precolour the fondant or mould the fondant and then paint on it with gel colouring? Also with the bark ring for the outside of the cake I am going to temper chocolate and apply that on top of buttercream but wonder am I best to grease the mould 1st and then pour the chocolate in before curving it slightly or will the chocolate come out of the silicon mould ok?

I have been a home baker for the last 20 years but this is by far the most eloborate cake I have ever attempted and I want to make sure it is perfect for him. Buttercream I am good as gold with but fondant is a whole other ball game for me.

She recommended a sleep specialist and a sleep study for breathing that came back normal. The doctor today said she believes everything I said aligns clinically with narcolepsy with cataplexy (I am still learning all these terms, bear with me please!!) and that the morning/waking hallucinations aren’t likely my husband playing cruel pranks but simply living my dreams as I am still asleep (the amount of times he’s seemingly gotten up to go make a coffee run only to have already left for work an hour prior is too heartbreaking to count), the sleep paralysis, and the “fragmented sleep” when I feel like I haven’t slept at all through the night is all normal amongst her narcoleptic patients. 

We’ve got a plan to take another in lab sleep study with the naps the following day sometime soon, but no relief or help in the meantime which stinks since I am really struggling. I am new to all of this and never thought of narcolepsy as a consideration… just that I was perpetually sleep deprived. I’m reading your stories and histories and learning a lot. Any advice navigating these next few weeks? My first test was at-home and it was weird sleeping with a bracelet and microphone on my collar… felt like I was up all night trying not to move to not disturb the devices. I am sure it varies from each hospital, but what were your experiences? I have anxiety and she said not to take those meds 5-7 days beforehand so I’m trying to alleviate nerves where I can. Thanks!!

After graduating from a good school with a bachelors in theatre arts (whoops, turns out I just love Shakespeare, theatre, reading, and art history, and don't want to make that my career) I fell into managing small businesses, namely coffee shops/cafés for 10 years.

I could pursue this further, but I've already hit my ceiling. I could manage bigger and bigger places, but I've seen what that does to people. Insane hours working all night and weekends, often to the detriment of personal relationships and ultimately burning out a lot of hard working managers. I'm happily married and in my 30s now and want to have a kid in the next couple years so I'd love weekends free, generally.

I'm currently enrolled in a post-bachelors Accounting Fundamentals program at UCLA and doing well. My uncle I'm very close with was a CPA for a long time so the career has always been on my radar; he's a great resource but he's retired now and doesn't exactly have his finger on the pulse of current career paths. I've always been good with numbers and managing accounts, cash flow, entering invoices, tracking cost of goods & labor, so there's definitely some transferrable skills. I'm confident that this is a good career path for me in the right situation. I'm in the Los Angeles area and there seems to be lots of options, but it's daunting knowing the right ones.

My question is, what accounting job titles should I be looking into once my program is done? A professor told me to stay away from Bookkeeping jobs because you'll stay a bookkeeper forever, for example. I'm absolutely willing to start from the bottom and pay my dues though. Money is nice, but work/life balance and decent benefits is the most important thing. What do you think?",1,1729556044.0,Accounting,6,1.0,False

I thought it was normal or I was just really out of shape.

A month and a half ago, I flew home from visiting my partner's family, and very suddenly started getting what I now know is pre-syncope while I was in the airport. It was terrifying. Every time I started to walk to my gate, I had to stop every few gates and sit because I was SO short of breath, my heart was out of control, and I was near passing out.

When I got home I thought maybe it was the altitude (I was at SLC) but one trip to grab coffee at the shop down the street from me and the subsequent pre-syncope from standing waiting for my order proved me wrong! I called my doctor that day and, after hearing my symptoms, they sent me to the ER. The ER was absolutely useless - I told the PA of my symptoms, EKG came back normal, he did a blood test to make sure I'm not anemic, etc. Before I left he asked if I have allergies and I said yes, but that they were seasonal. He left and prescribed me ZYRTEC. 

HOWEVER! I knew this was wrong, and at this point I suspected POTS. I was having constant pre-syncope episodes, could barely go to the bathroom without blacking out, and just wanted to sleep all of the time. I scheduled a followup with my PCP, who was shocked at my ER experience and said this sounds like classic POTS. Thanks to all of you, I had already downloaded the TachyMon app on my Apple Watch and had data to give her. She scheduled me for a holter for 48 hours, which was one week ago.

Today we met to go over my results - I was nervous because I had quite a few PVCs on my results (also LOTS of tachycardia), but she said she isn't worried about the PVCs and that she is ""extremely comfortable"" diagnosing me right then and there with POTS. So, now I am starting propranolol this week and hopefully getting in with a POTS-specialized physical therapist! 

I feel like I see so many very real and very difficult diagnostic stories here, so I thought I'd share a positive experience because I was *very* lucky to have a doctor that listened to me, knew about POTS, and was comfortable making a diagnosis without a tilt table. I'm endlessly grateful to this subreddit for providing me with resources about symptoms, doctors, and overall experiences - it made this last month and a half feel just a little bit more manageable. ❤️",4,1729555842.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

Tom sat on his porch, sipping a cup of lukewarm coffee. The sky was clear, and there wasn’t a cloud in sight. He glanced at the lawn in front of him, noting how the grass looked a little taller than the day before. It wasn’t anything too dramatic, just a subtle growth that had taken place overnight. He made a mental note to mow it later in the week, but not today.

The hours passed quietly as Tom sat there, occasionally shifting in his chair. A car drove by every now and then, but the street was mostly quiet. The leaves on the trees swayed slightly in the light breeze, but nothing much happened. Tom took another sip of coffee, realizing it had gone cold. He didn’t mind though, as it gave him something to do for a moment—walking inside to refill his cup.

Around noon, Tom noticed a few ants marching across the porch. He watched them for a while, observing how they moved in single file, disappearing into a crack near the steps. He thought about what they might be doing, but didn’t dwell on it for long. It was, after all, just another quiet day. The sun was higher in the sky now, casting longer shadows from the trees. The grass, still growing at its steady pace, was greener than ever.

By mid-afternoon, Tom found himself still on the porch, now flipping through an old magazine he had read several times before. The articles were familiar, but they filled the time. A bird chirped in the distance, but Tom didn’t pay much attention. Occasionally, he glanced at his watch, noting how the day was slowly slipping away. The grass, still growing, seemed to be at the same height as when he first noticed it.

As the evening approached, the temperature began to cool. Tom stood up, stretched, and looked at the lawn one last time. The grass was ready for a trim, but not today. He went back inside, thinking about what he might do tomorrow. It would probably be the same as today: sit on the porch, drink coffee, and watch the grass grow.

My new doctor wants to stop my prescription. 

I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP, which helped but not completely. I use my CPAP 100% of the time, even when napping. So my previous doctor put me on Modafinil and it was a godsend. It literally saved my job and lets me live a normal life. I no longer have to dose myself with 1000-2000mg of caffeine a day trying to stay awake.  Now I only have one cup of coffee a day, if that. I usually skip the pill on weekends per my previous doctor's advice. As far as I know I haven't had any bad side effects, it just works. 

My doctor moved so I have a new doctor now who seems to think that being on modafinil long term is Bad and that the goal is to get me off it. He insisted I needed a sleep study etc etc, which I have already done. I did the whole sleep-in-the-lab, wired up and on camera thing in 2016 and it was quite unpleasant and I really do not want to do that again. After a lot of back-and-forth messaging he finally found the records and saw it was legit and that I wasn't just making things up. (why would I?!?!)  I really don't want to go through a sleep study again for both cost reasons and because it was just a really unpleasant experience. I was barely able to sleep long enough to get enough data.

So New Doc has been making a fuss and threatening to not renew my prescription because ""it's not a long term solution"". But to me, it IS. It lets me function. 

If he pulls my Rx, I don't know what I will do. On workdays I've tried to not take it, I am groggy all day and crashing by afternoon even with caffeine. 

This doctor is very young, very new,  and seems like he's very gung-ho ""If you were healthy you wouldn't need any meds so it's your fault you're not healthy and on drugs."" He acts like it's some heavy duty controlled substance like fentanyl or methadone or something and it's my moral failing that I need it. But I'm NOT a young 20-something teetotalling vegan triathlete like he is, I'm a late 50s guy with some health issues that I need help with. 

What can I do to convince him I'm not some drug-seeking addict looking for my next high? I'm not snorting Adderall for the buzz. I just want to be able to work and pay my mortgage.

I believe I’ve had POTS since childhood, but my symptoms didn’t become disabling until I got COVID in October 2023. I obviously want to avoid a repeat infection, so getting a booster shot seemed logical. However, my cardiologist told me to hold off. He didn’t give me specific reasons, but just told me to wait on it. I assume it’s because there’s a risk for a flare up due to the vaccine mechanism. 

I’m no pharmacologist so I don’t know the intricacies of this stuff, but I read about the new Novavax vaccine and felt comfortable enough to go get it this past Saturday. I just wanted to report on my experience for anyone who wants a booster but doesn’t want to or can’t get an mRNA vaccine. 

I actually felt great after my booster. It may have just been the relief of not having an immediate reaction, but I just felt good that day. The next day, I felt a tiny bit sluggish but in good spirits and had energy again by evening. My arm was of course a bit sore but not unbearable. Day 3 (today) I still feel shockingly good, I have energy and my heart rate hasn’t been spiking nearly as bad as normal. On a given day, my HR can get up to 180 just from getting out of bed, taking out the trash, emptying the dishwasher etc. Today I was able to run errands (groceries from TWO stores), refinish a coffee table, and do a bunch of cleaning around my apartment. I don’t think my HR went above 120 or so. 

I’m willing to accept this as a fluke, but I am honestly just so happy I could get a vaccine without triggering a horrendous flare up like I was worried about. I do also know that my increased energy and positive effects is likely temporary. Obviously, everyone is different, but Novavax seems like a good option for people with POTS, anecdotally. 

Would love to hear from anyone else who got POTS from covid and has been vaccinated since then. Or just POTS vaccine stories in general! ",9,1729555215.0,POTS,1,1.0,False

I've been having issues for a while (nausea, abdominal pain/back pain, right side pain, vomiting) and went to the ER a few days ago for pain that wouldn't go away after several hours. They said it was likely gerd (which I have), but a CT scan they gave me showed I have gallstones. I followed up my my PCP and I'm getting an MRI in a couple weeks. Both doctors don't seem to think it's related to the gallstones because nothing appeared blocked on the CT. 

My mother recently had her gallbladder removed (gallstones) and said it sounds exactly like her issues. 

I guess my question is, is it possible my symptons could be caused by my gallbladder/gallstones even if the stones weren't blocking a duct? Not sure on size, but they said multiple. I haven't had a fever, jaundice, etc. I noticed I get pain when I eat fatty foods (cheese/dairy) or high caffeine (more than one black coffee), and not from my typical gerd triggers. This doesn't feel like past gerd experiences and I don't have any reflux. I mainly feel constant nausea, bloating, and lack of appetite (when not having pain at night). I tried a liquid diet for a day or so (doctors orders) and now I'm limiting fat/caffeine. I'm barely eating (small meals, nothing processed). 

Is there anything else I should be asking doctors? If this sounds like gallbladder issues, how do I get the doctor to accept it? The ER doctor basically said it wasn't possible to be be the culprit without signs of blockage and my PCP seems to agree. ",1,1729555208.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Hey fellow globetrotting Redditors! It’s Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and today I’m spilling the Seattle beans on why solo travel is the ultimate adventure jackpot. Buckle up as we ride through the quirks and quirks of going it alone in the Emerald City! 🌟

**🎭 Unique Experiences Await You!**
Ever stood atop the Space Needle feeling like Leonardo DiCaprio on the Titanic, minus the iceberg? The solo exploration of iconic spots like Pike Place Market means it's just you and the seafood. No forks in the way, just you and that luscious salmon – cue the discreet happy dance. Oh, and did I mention disastrously singing along with a street busker? I’ve since decided to keep my day job. 😉

**🌧️ Facing Challenges Head-On:**
In Seattle, you bring an umbrella or become über-friendly with awnings. I chose the latter, darting between cafes in drizzle-induced panic. Ending up in a Capitol Hill coffee hub, not only did I discover their creamy lattes, but I also emerged as a self-proclaimed rain-dodging ninja. Trust me, battling for the last piece of crab is nothing compared to self-tackling these tiny life puzzles.

**🤔 Solo Travel Perspective – Mindset Upgrade:**
Is there a moment more enlightening than standing in Kerry Park at sunrise, realizing those skyscrapers aren’t just views but metaphors for tackling fears? Solo travel really does prompt you to lift your own veil, revealing your latent capabilities. Who knew I could navigate like a local and manage to not lose a single sock in the hostel dryer?

**🔥 Pro Tips from u/solopassions:**

1. **Become One with the Culture:** Dive deeper than just the sights. Hit up the Museum of History & Industry—it’s like a time machine that takes you straight to Seattle’s heart.
   
2. **Stay Chatty, Stay Adventurous:** Some of my best tips came from casual chats, like the barista’s suggestion of Discovery Park. Best bike ride / best leg workout contest won—hands down!

3. **Pack Less, Live More:** Trust me, you’ll thank me when stuffing souvenirs becomes possible, and you're skipping down the streets unburdened.

4. **Embrace Random Adventure:** Seriously, some of the most fun I had was veering off the itinerary and letting Seattle surprise me.

Whether you're a history buff captivated by stories of Seattle’s pioneers or an adventurer hitting up those adrenaline-pumping rapids, Seattle has a slice (or a cup of coffee!) for everyone. 

So, solo traveler, it's your turn to pack that bag. Embrace Seattle’s zest and bask in the enchantment of its scenic cacophony. You never know what corners of yourself you'll discover between those tranquil mountains and vibrant cityscapes.

Happy exploring and may your adventures be ever bold,

So there’s this guy who’s been very vocal sa common friends and ibang kakilala namin na he likes me. 2 years ago nagpapa reto sya sakin through a common friend namin but I declined kasi I was just fresh from a break up noon and no interest in dating yet. And to be honest, he was not my type back then. Okay naman sya, may appeal din but hindi ko lang talaga type at that time. Since then, nagkikita kami sa get together ng friends namin pero yung interactions namin mostly hi/hello lang. Despite this, tuloy padin yung pag express nya sa ibang tao that he likes me. I found it weird na he can say things like dream girl nya ko etc. to other people without knowing me yet. Parang ang superficial lang ng basis nya to say that. Tsaka medyo off sakin yung ang dami nyang pinag sasabihan na he likes me but he’s not doing anything about it like make an effort to small talk pag nagkakasama kami sa get together with friends, or replying sa stories ko or messages sa social media to start a conversation. No nothing. I don’t know if nadiscourage na sya nung nag no ako sa reto 2 years ago or baka I came across too snob kasi sabi ng friends namin may ganong aura ako minsan. But ang malabo kasi even after these, he keeps on telling others na he likes me. Now, fast forward to a month ago, niyaya ako ng friends ko to play tennis. He’s playing tennis din. We had a chance to talk kasi we were planning for a despedida tennis match para sa isang friend namin. That’s the first time we had a chance na makapag usap ng matagal and okay naman pala sya. He even helped me buy my first tennis racket kasi wala akong idea what’s the best one to buy. Since then, he always checks on me kasi nagpapa coach ako and he was checking my progress, what I need, etc. We’d chat most of the time pero kadalasan madalas about tennis lang. When he comes home sa place namin, he’d ask me na maglaro together kaso palaging hindi nag mamatch schedules namin because of work (we were elementary schoolmates and he goes to Manila for work, ako naman still based sa area namin working sa family business and he goes home once a week or every two weeks). Nung last na invite nya sakin, I felt bad na I need to decline again kasi may other commitment ako so sabi ko if free pa sya later that day, we can have coffee nalang. Natuloy naman kami mag coffee and I’m glad we did cause we were able to talk about many things other than tennis. Nung pauwi na, he messaged me na mag ingat pag drive. I thanked him for the coffee. He even messaged me pa that night na nakauwi na sya and we chatted for a while pa. So sabi ko sa sarili ko if he asked me again to date, I’ll give it a chance. But now, 1 week later, we’re back to no chatting/talking for days. Balik sya sa dating style nya na puro react lang sa stories ko. Walang palya. I find it weird kasi I honestly thought I gave him signs already na I’m open to dating. Naiinis lang ako kasi I’m starting to see him in a different light tapos ang bagal padin nya mag make ng move or baka wala naman talagang balak. If it’s the latter, sana tigilan na nya kakasabi sa ibang tao that he likes me, na crush nya ko ever since, na kinikilig sya sa encounters namin, and stop liking my every single post sa social media. Tapos won’t act on it naman. Tigilan nalang nya kung ganon. Hahahaha. Yun lang rant ko 😂 ",1,1729554751.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False
1g94ilh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1g94ilh/im_exhausted_everything_is_never_ending/,I'm exhausted. Everything is never ending,"I've complained about this before but here I am again.

I'm exhausted. My husband and I both work full time but different hours. I work 900am-530am, he works 2pm-10pm. 

I get up in the morning and set everything up. I make coffee, I make sure the highchair is clean and ready to use, I make sure dishes are washed, I pick out an outfit for our daughter and lay it out on the changing table. I get baby up, give her a change and set her up to play. 

Then I finally get to sit down and suck back my coffee and some toast before work.

My husband feeds the baby breakfast, dresses her and puts some lunch in her bag and drops her off with the babysitter for 130.

I get off work at 530pm and immediately start cleaning. I clean the kitchen, wash the dishes, wipe the surfaces down, fold/put away laundry if needed, clean the livingroom (fold blankets, get the cushions back in order, pick up laundry/anything else on the floor) and make supper for baby who gets dropped off around 615pm. Once baby is home, I get her fed supper, get her washed up and into her jammies and let her play until 715-720 at which point she gets her last bottle and then bed.

I get her down before 8 most nights if she doesn't fight it too hard and then I finish whatever cleaning needs to be done. 

And then I cook supper around 930 so it'll be ready when he gets home at 10.

Today, I have to deal with the garbage. We have a big bin in the kitchen and got some bags that fit it finally. Well the bag got over filled and these new bags have no handles of any kind to tie off with so now I have to take garbage out of the bin and put it into a new bag so I tie off the one in the bin, so that husband can drag the bin to the road when he gets home.

It's nearly 9pm, I still have to go deal with the garbage and cook. I've had about 20 minutes of sit down, relaxing time since I got off work at 530. 

What does my husband do when he gets home from work? Take off his work clothes, Wash his hands/face and sit down with supper and tv/video games for the night.

I'd kill to get off work and be able to just simply relax. Have the food already done, the chores already taken care of. 

To just be able to sit and enjoy my time for a little while. But I can't because the list of things that need doing literally never ends and if I slack off, even for a night, the place basically falls apart.",3,1729554670.0,breakingmom,2,0.71,False

My name is David, a 28-year-old guy from New Jersey. I'm here in search of a meaningful relationship with a like-minded individual who shares my values and aspirations.

In terms of appearance, I'm of average height at around 5'10"". I'm bald but naturally blond with a stylish beard. You'll often find me rocking black band shirts and comfy sweatshirts. If you're into a laid-back and alternative aesthetic, we might just hit it off! Here are multiple pictures of me: https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G

When I'm not immersed in a game or exploring extreme metal music (mostly Black Metal), I enjoy the company of my friends. Together, we go on camping trips, visit museums, get dinner or treats, watch movies, play board games, and hang out. We've also visited the Renaissance faire a couple of times. I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pokémon. Recently, I've also gotten into building model kits. Outside of the game store, I'm trying some language learning, こんにちは. I would love to play D&D, but I don't quite have the time or people, unfortunately. One of my best friend's girlfriends has expressed interest, so don't be afraid to be nerdy with us.

Professionally, I am an IT Tech. I just started at a new place, and I've been learning new things and getting along great with all my coworkers. Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I'm a laid-back individual who doesn't partake in drugs or party scenes (yes, I even abstain from coffee!). I don't drink alcohol either, but I don't mind if you do. My friends have beers while I'm around. Apparently, I have an INTJ personality type. I maintain a positive and lighthearted atmosphere, constantly cracking jokes with my close-knit group of friends.

In terms of my ideal partner, I'm looking for someone around the ages of 18 and 25, preferably of East Asian or Caucasian descent. As someone who's reasonably skinny, I am also looking for someone who is slim, fit, or petite. I'm not the biggest fan of tattoos or piercings either, but that's not always a dealbreaker, so don't let that completely deter you.

My long-term goals involve building a future together and creating a life filled with meaningful experiences and shared adventures. If you resonate with my interests, values, and long-term goals, shoot me a message and a pic—I’m genuinely looking forward to getting to know you!",3,1729554573.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Oh, just a quick aside - I do tend to prefer the weird processes and fermentations for coffee, so my tastes are somewhat skewed. But if you are looking for honey process or anaerobic fermentation, Torque is more likely to have it than some other roasters. ",14,1729554562.0,FoodSanDiego,5,1.0,False

After the full time for a 12-cup pot, only 3-4 cups have been used (the reservoir indicator still shows ""8""). Also, there is much more steam being generated than usual, to the point that the surface of the machine is burning to the touch, and the steam is collecting under the machine and dripping down, causing the base and table around it to have puddles.

I descaled a couple of weeks ago, but tried again today. It had no effect. I called support, and was surprised when they mentioned they do not recommend using vinegar to descale (despite those being the directions in the manual), and could sell me their ""commercial descaler"". Otherwise, my options were to send it in for an inspection (and estimate for fixes) or 25% off a new purchase.

I know that having a kid can put a damper on things, but it has been *months*. When we originally got the green light from the doctor to resume intercourse, we did a couple times and she said it felt really good (if not better than before having a kid). 

Recently, it seems like something has shifted. Probably something in both of us. I know that after the baby is asleep from the night, I am kinda jumping out the gate, where she needs a bit more time to warm up. For her part, she is saying that I'm not doing anything to turn her on. But I'm doing everything I used to and more. 

I tell her how beautiful she is (in both romantic and more sexualized ways). I give her big praise on how great of a mother she is, and how much she does (even on the days where she does nothing around the house). I bring home flowers (I don't think it's sexual currency). I do things around the house that she wants done (granted I can't get to everything). I take part in family stuff like photos, and craft things. I make her coffee in the morning.

And yet she continues to tell me that I'm not doing what she needs to get turned on. I know I have let my appearance slide since we had the baby, I haven't gone to the barber as frequently, I haven't been able to break away to the gym like I used to.  I have no extra time in the day to do more than I'm already doing in hopes that she MIGHT want to have sex. 

I miss that connection with her. I don't know why suddenly she is so closed off to sex but it hurts like hell.

Anyone who suggests divorce or a thing like that, please GTFO.

More than happy but I‘ve got a question about the sizing of the coffee. So first of all I didn‘t change anything about the amount of coffee I‘ll get by pressing it either lungo or espresso. But when I opened the sample package some capsules have the recommendation either 25, 40 or 110 ml. So 110 ml is the lungo button? 25ml is the espresso button? But whats with the 40 ml though? 

And lets say a capsule is recommended for 110 ml (lungo size) and I only press the espresso button and then throw the capsule away. Would this be a waste? Like could I have gotten more espresso shots out of this one capsule or is the machine using all of the coffee in the capsule even though I pressed the espresso instead of the lungo button?

A little over 2000 square feet. We have this really awkward space right behind the couch. Honestly I’m struggling with how to decorate the house in the first place. It’s a beautiful home but it’s almost too YELLOW. The walls are this weird cream yellow and the carpets and tile match. I am in Arizona so the tile and wall color is pretty standard but it’s just the vibe that I’m trying to go for. I’m trying to go more for a “homey” vibe. Cottagy vibe. Again I’m in Arizona and the closest place you can find an “actual” cottage is where there aren’t any jobs. I am a real estate agent but I’m trying to come up with ideas with a lower budget. 

Please let me know of any ideas that might look good. Or if better or more recent pictures are needed. These pictures are from when we JUST moved in and the most recent ones that I took for this post.

In the kitchen alone the wall with the miller picture, I want to add floor to ceiling cabinetry and shelving. Almost like a “coffee bar” but not quite. Maybe more for decorations and old antiques. 

In the living room behind the couch we don’t even use the dog kennel. We only have it for when there are guests over so it can be folded up and put in one of the spare bedrooms. There’s still some loose stuff we haven’t figured out what to do with yet. I know we for sure want to make the house house hardwood, close to the color of the kitchen cabinets, so it will have a darker more comfy vibe but I have no idea what to do with the walls. I know I want to maybe do a crown molding and molding on the bottom that matches and switch out all of the switch covers and have them match. We are wanting more darker blue hues throughout the house as well. I’m hoping for any ideas that would sound good. And ESPECIALLY any ideas for behind the couch. We’ve got no clue what to do there. 

We don’t know what to do with the entry way either. It’s kind of just a box and the doors to the study make it impossible to actually do something big. We are planning on changing all double doors to French doors including the sliding door at some point as well. 

I would appreciate any ideas thrown at me. Also as you can see the yellow walls make everything thing yellowish. I’m all for a natural glow but it feels gross rather than comfortable.

I initially called a few marinas in Red Band (a favorite cruising destination of mine), but was told they were closed for the season. 

I then called up Atlantic Highlands Municipal Marina, who happily provided us a transient slip reservation. We cast off around 10:00am on Friday morning, and made our way across Raritan Bay. The weather was beautiful for mid-late October, maybe 60 degrees with a mild, 8kt wind. 

I had made this trip over a dozen times, so I was pretty much in autopilot for the first 40 minutes or so - although we did have to keep an eye out for lobster pots. Our course was set for the buoy indicating the restricted area surrounding the Earle Munitions Pier. For anyone who hasn’t navigated Sandy Hook Bay before, there is a munitions pier that you have to keep away from (a few hundred yards at least. It’s marked by white buoys which say that “the use of deadly force is authorized.” Definitely disconcerting for newbies, but cool nonetheless. If you happen to meander within that area, there is usually a police boat that will come up to you at full throttle and let you know you have to make your way out. 

After we passed the third (and final) buoy marking the restricted zone, we made our way to the entrance of Atlantic Highlands Municipal Harbor. The harbor is protected by a big jetty that serves as a breakwater, and you can enter through either end of said breakwater. We came in the north end, by where the Seastreak ferries are docked. 

Before going to our slip, we stopped at the fuel dock and put a few gallons on the tank. We also wanted to figure out where exactly our slip was located. The recon mission didn’t work too well, and we went up and down the piers until we found our assigned slip. The slips at this marina have a floating dock at the stern, but there are no fingers, so you have to tie your bow lines to two pilings. It’s a frustrating setup, given the 6ft tide swing, but we eventually got set up. 

After getting tied up, we took a walk through town, and had some coffee at Dunkin. We then walked back to the boat and killed some time, before deciding to go for a short bike ride on the Henry Hudson Trail. I honestly am not a fan of this trail, it has a whole bunch of intersections that make it impossible to get an uninterrupted ride in, and also has a lot of uneven spots caused by tree routes. We appreciated the attempt at cycling infrastructure, though.

After our ride, we dropped the bikes off at the boat, and walked back into town for dinner. We looked at a few menus, before deciding on the Atlantic House Diner. It was a good meal, and we were able to watch the last Mets victory of the season (game 5 of the NLCS). 

We then walked back to the boat, and settled on for a good nights rest. I was honestly a bit surprised that we didn’t need the heat, but it was honestly very comfortable. 

The following morning, we took the 2-mile bike ride to Huddy Park for the Highlands Farmers Market. I’ve been to this market before, but this particular day it was underwhelming. Not too many tents set up. We bought some extremely overpriced crumb cake, and made our way back to the boat for breakfast. 

After breakfast, we cast off the dock and headed home. The weather on Saturday was even nicer than the previous day: high 60s and no wind. There were a ton of boats on the water, especially for this late in the season. We had to weave around fishing boats with trolling lines out, and even came across my dad out fishing in his little Mako. 

We arrived back in our home harbor, knowing that it would likely be our last time doing so this year. 

Overall, this was a fun little getaway. The Highlands isn’t the nicest town in the world (like I said, I prefer nearby Red Bank), but it’s super convenient for us and really has everything you need for a quick overnighter. I’m happy we got to get out one last time before the dreaded winter! ",1,1729553224.0,SmallBoatCruising,0,1.0,False

Friday night was a blast, we went to the pub for some food and drinks. My friend slept in the spare bedroom which is currently being used to store extra clothing. I also have a makeup vanity in there with some of my makeup items on display, including my lipsticks (this is important for later). 

On Saturday morning when I went to bring my friend a cup of coffee, I noticed that one of my Tom Ford lipsticks was missing from my lipstick organizer and a different brand was put in its place. I am VERY type A and am very particular about how I organize my things, to the point of being obsessive. I always store the brands together and never would have organized it like this. I also applied this particular lipstick before we went to the pub last night, so I know for A FACT that it was there yesterday. 

I didn’t immediately say anything. I thought maybe there was an explanation for it? But the longer I thought about it the more it started to bother me because it’s an $80 tube of lipstick (please don’t judge, it’s something that brings me joy). 

So I started looking for it, not necessarily thinking she took it or anything, but noticed an immediate change in her body language and she started acting cagey. She tried to convince me that I didn’t wear lipstick on Friday night (even though I was clearly wearing it in the photos we took together), then tried to get me to leave the room. 

I got a weird feeling so I asked her directly if there’s any way she could have taken it. Maybe she accidentally thought it belonged to her? She said no, but I was firm and said that it was in its ‘proper’ spot when we left last night. 

Long story short, she started searching her backpack (I didn’t ask her to do this) and pulled it out of this tiny hidden pocket. It wasn’t in her makeup bag or in any other compartment where she put her things, but in this SMALL hidden zipper inside of a front pocket. She backtracked and claimed she must’ve thought it was hers. But if so, why wasn’t it with the rest of her makeup? She definitely tried to steal this right?

I tried to act normal for the rest of her stay but it was definitely a bit awkward. Now that she’s left and I’ve had more time to think about it, I am SUPER weirded out by this. First of all, who steals _lipstick_?? And how can I ever trust her in my house again? I feel like I need to go take inventory of the rest of my belongings. 

I’m thinking I want to take a step back from this friendship, but AIO? Can you think of any other reason why my lipstick would end up in a hidden pocket in her backpack?",2,1729553185.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

1g93wzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g93wzl/defending_cozy_fiction/,Defending Cozy Fiction,"Recently I’ve got into the habit of reading cozy fantasy – relaxing stories without violence and with little to no stakes. Travis Baldree, Becky Chambers etc.

I find cozy fiction to be a most welcomed break from reality, as well as from the traditional narratives of popular fiction: action, crime, mystery etc. It is understandable in that regard, that many people may find cozy fiction boring or pointless, because, why read a story that has no obstacles or action?

But I’d like to defend cozy fiction in that regard. We live in a world that is constantly moving, most of us in first-world capitalist societies, where the hunt for opportunities and for a better life is constant, and ends up eating people from the inside. Combine this with the various threats of modern life, like political polarization, climate crisis, social and economic instability, a crushing work culture, and I believe it is pretty understandable why people turn to a book like *Legends & Lattes* to relax and spend their evening.

Action and drama are great, but coziness and calmness should also be part of our daily lives and our reading culture. It is why many people play Minecraft or watch Miyazaki’s films. A story doesn’t need to have great action and/or violence to be compelling. Sometimes is better to take a step back and enjoy the small things in life: drinking a coffee at your favorite café, reading a book you like, or going in a stroll through the woods with your robot friend while talking philosophy. Our lives tend to be quite action packed and stressful – there’s no need for the entirety of our fiction to be the same.

Today cozy fiction represents a generally small part of the overall literary world I believe, and I hope it will expand in the years to come. We’ve seen enough stories about war, violence and apathy. It’s time to hear stories about sunshine, peacefulness and empathy. Because a human being usually needs both in order to properly exist in a civilized society, and we have given too much room to the first one.     ",23,1729552952.0,books,31,0.76,False

The espresso machine market here is quite limited. Someone I know who lives in the US is coming to Brazil in March 2025, so I’m taking this opportunity to buy a long-term espresso machine—something I can use for at least a decade. My budget is around $950 USD.

The options I’m considering are:

* MiiCoffee Apex v2 (I know it's not long-term, but it's budget-friendly).
* Rancilio Silvia v6.
* ECM Casa (refurbished from WLL).
* Profitec Go (refurbished from WLL).

By the way, I’d also get a PID kit for the ECM and Rancilio, even though I don’t plan to install it right away. Since we don’t have those kits available here, I might as well buy them now to save the hassle and cost of importing later.

Questions:

* Has anyone bought refurbished machines from WLL? Is it a good idea, or should I avoid it? I’d prefer a new one, but they have nice discounts on those used/refurbished that fit my budget.
* With Black Friday coming up, does WLL or any other site offer good deals?
* Should I wait for a new espresso machine launch or sale that might be worth considering?

Thoughts?","""Short"" Synopsis here (sorry for potentially trigger stuff but I legitimately am afraid to say anything and wanted some guidance)

I've been in almost 19 and am getting ready to hit the button.  Already have diagnosed sleep apnea, and some other issues but the one that bugs me the most...only the wifey and my friend knows about.

Way back in 09/10 I was deployed in a pretty non-standard position to a rather well known combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan.  We basically took direct and indirect every day.  I was young and dumb and thought it was cool and it was what I had signed up for--wanted to do my part (9/11 was partly why I signed up for...).  

About two months in I was manning a camera system and noticed folks (thermal) on a spur by us.  Told the captain and due to our ROE in the area we started firing artilliary.  Couple hours later we had the typical village elders at our ECP--instead of asking for payment in rice etc, this time we were told that we had just attacked a bunch of women and children...standard for them to say but apparently at least one kid had been hit.  And that was on me....or at least that's how I've internalized it.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we had a pretty significant event where we saw some locals moving a weapons cache...they were stopped and the patrol brought back some battle damage assessment photos...kid was probably 15. Something else that's stuck with me.

Mother passed away about 2/3 of my deployment so I came back via humanitarian and they just kept me back stateside.  I only remember bits and pieces coming home. Wife says I screamed in my sleep--I don't remember it. Friend says and continues to say that I've changed.

Got back to my base after the funeral and did my post deployment health assessment. As far as I remember I answered all the questions truthfully (see any dead bodies, experience combat, etc).... but I was never contacted by my PCM and just went on my way through my 20s. 

Fast forward to now:  I have a couple of amazing kids. Only..now that they are older I start to think back about that stuff quite a bit--more and more.  Seems like I'm having memory issues (despite finishing 2 degrees), I get antsy in public settings and have had a couple of, I guess, panic attacks after driving in some current work related convoys through the city. Thankfully? Nobody noticed, but it wrecked me for a couple of days.  Helicopters...yeah that's another that screws me up now.  We have police helicopters some nights around me and if I hear them at night--well, might as well just get some coffee and stay up. If it's a chinook from the local base, I'm royally messed up nervous wreck for days after.  If I see it flying in the day--I'm fine.. at night? Not so much.  I think it's because I used to fly on them at night to get from COP to COP.

Ive talked to the wife about this and it has helped immensely.  That being said, its not really ""gone away""...still there just under the surface. I have NOT talked to mental health...couple of reasons:

Stigma where I am of seeking help and getting removed from a position.  They say it wont, but I have had subordinates that had things go south for them.

Biggest reason? I'm afraid someone is going to call me a lier.  I have zero clue about how to get any witness statements from where I was at. I've not kept up with folks and the two that I could probably reach out to were..well..pieces of work. I wouldn't put it past them to just ignore me. Additionally, I don't have a combat related AFSC and the MH that we have at my unit are all Army. I don't have a CAB (we, USAF, weren't given them), I never sought my AFCAM because I was told that if I did I'd probably get an ART15 because I wasn't ""supposed to be doing ""Army"" things"".   I do have an ARCOM (I guess it's rare for a USAF SSgt to get one?) and a write up blurb in one of my evals about where I was deployed to.  A simple YouTube search of the place basically gives anyone a very vivid picture of what this place was like).

I'm stuck.  I think I need an assist because I want to get this documented, not only because of disability, but I'm legitimately worried that there is a potential of this getting worse as I go along. It's going to wreck me though if I get someone that doesn't listen.  

Any tips from someone that's honest through something like this?

Nicole:  Okay...  Bignuts the Barbarian kicks down the door.  He's there because Principal Lynn forced him to be there as punishment for giving you a swirly.

Jeffrey:  This isn't real life, Nicole.  It's fantasy.

Nicole:  I know.  In the fantasy world, it was a GUY who gave you a swirly, which is much less embarassing for you.

Jeffrey:  Fine, but there's no Principal Lynn in this world, so try again.

Nicole:  Who's the authority figure here, then?

Jeffrey:  Well, there's the demon king...

Nicole:  Big nuts throws a guy out of his chair, and addresses the whole bar.  He says, ""Listen up, I'm working for the demon king, now give me free booze and wenches or I'll tell him this shithole needs to be burned down!""

Nicole:  How do I do that?

Hunter:  Roll the big die, and add your deception modifier to the result.

Nicole:  Okay...  \*Rolls\*  Seventeen.

Jeffrey:  They believe you, I guess.  They offer you an empty table.  Anything else?

Nicole:  Nah, I'm good.

Jeffrey:  Okay...  \*Rolls\*  Jecka, you're up next.

Karen:  Why is Jecka here again?

Jecka:  I participated in the swirly.  \*Clears throat\*  Following behind Bignuts is Diane, a beautiful high elf maiden cleric who only wears the latest elven fashion.  She approaches Bignuts's table, before announcing that she's also with the demon king, and wants the most expensive coffee on the menu for free.

Jeffrey:  One more deception check...

Jecka:  Ooh, since I'm with Bignuts, can I roll that with...  \*Looks at her notes\*  Advantage?

Jeffrey:  Fine, go ahead...

Jecka:  \*Rolls\*  20, non natural!

Jeffrey:  As soon as you sit down, the owner of the tavern approaches your table.  ""Hey you two, we don't like the Demon king around here.  If you want to get out of here alive, you're gonna have to perform favors for everyone here...  With your bodies.

Hi all.

I took the 10 day course for the first time after having my own informal practice for a year and a half and I really got so much more than expected from this course. I felt like I learned how to work properly. I felt like I Dissolved some complexes and was aware of some other ones. I didn’t even know about before. I felt very ready to go back to the real world.

Now, fast forward to being in the real world. I just feel tired a lot. Equanimous  but still very tired. I have also tried my best to carry through some of the positive changes from the course and this is where I really wanted to hear some feedback or similar experiences from others.

I went from being a heavy coffee drinker to drinking only tea on day three and then haven’t drank tea since. It’s been 2 1/2 weeks since I’ve consumed caffeine.

I kept the vegetarian diet that is new for me, but I also feel like I am struggling to have a fully nutritious diet.

I am dedicating sleeping hours from 10 PM to 5 AM with two 1 hour meditation sessions before and after that.

these three changes are substantial and all happening at once and I could imagine it could contribute to why I’m feeling the way I am.

I just wanted to hear some feedback from the community whether it be some more stories or opposite stories or how to manage going forward.

It’s been over a week since I got out of the course and I’ve been sitting two hours a day as compared to 40 minutes a day and I definitely feel a lot calmer for sure. I also feel just a lot more tired. 

The last couple days, both morning and night sits have been very drowsy to the point where I feel like I’m gonna fall out of my meditation bench

My first batch of coffee roasted pretty well and it roasted shockingly evenly considering that it was just on a pan. Anyway, my 2nd batch i roasted larger however I got impatient with the degassing stage and i decided to try pull a shot on the same day that I roasted the beans. I do a 18 grams in to 36 grams out and do wdt, distribution and tamp. The shots have been coming out really quickly with a weak flavour. Is it possible that this is because i haven’t given them time to release the gas yet? I am properly dialled in.

One thing led to another, we started talking, he became good friends with my friend group, whenever I studied in the library—he will too despite saying that he “hated” that place, he tries everything I like from coffee to what I eat for lunch, we go on face time to read homework three times a week..sometimes he’d go 4hrs past his bedtime, he grabs every opportunity to sit beside me, we walk home together, etc. To the point that my classmates have been asking “are y'all together?” 

The thing is, I tried to “show” that I like him by holding his arm or rubbing his back/shoulders. He never showed discomfort and sometime Id test the waters by leaning my head on his shoulder—same thing..he would let me. 

My other guy friends have been bugging me to confess to him to which I declined. I'm scared of rejection lol. So one of them asked the guy that I like “who do you find prettiest in class?” and he said he found me pretty.

A golden-framed inscription on a stone on a island, where a laboratory used to be: *""This is an excerpt of Janes notes, a human from Terra, who had as little incentive or reason as the Kap'tan and the Kapt'an of the fleet-ship Theseus, to ""bring back our species""...and did it anyways out of the kindness of their hearts, fulfilling a promise made eons ago.*

""What kind of place even is this?"" I asked myself after the first weeks on FUSS, Terran planet. They hadn't even given the damn planet a name at all - it was just a matter of *since the Terrans live there, it's now the Terran planet for the time being.* The same happened to the Jyxiton planet as well as all other planets in this system. And then we have the issue of the freaking streets. Each one had a number, which would have somewhat made sense. But no. They call it ""Horizontal street 3"" or ""Vertical street 5"" and multiple times I have gotten lost since they insist that ""if it's a horizontal or vertical street depends on your matter of perspective"" and that ""if it's number 3 or number 5 depends on where you start counting"". Yes, the street names here *depend on the relative position of the explainer, and their bearing, when explaining.* This led to some ... interesting ... architectural and civil planning ""solutions"". At this point I'm divided between three hypothesis:

1. They are playing a very elaborate prank on me
2. This planet inhabits a population that collectively suffers cognitive malfunction
3. Both

That is not to say that they aren't nice people. They are. They've brought me almost everything requested - no matter how ludicrous or dangerous it may sound - and my request for a *demon core* was answered with the question: ""What kind?"". Upon further investigation they had asked if ""I wanted a 89 millimeter, 6.2 kilogram heavy ball of plutonium surrounded by tungsten carbide or the heart of a cosmic horror"", stating that ""the first would be easy to find in the demon core fields and the second was a bit harder to come by, as they don't know if cosmic horrors have hearts"". The apparent ease with which the former thing was acquired around here were almost as shocking to me as the people here. To my horror, when I went to investigate these fields, my Geiger counter went crazy and I decided to turn back. Playing with those things was apparently a past-time around here, which doesn't surprise me, considering their rather short life spans and the sheer amount of ridiculous and idiotic causes of death I read in the wall. First I thought they were exaggerating, as I thought nobody could be this stupid, but the longer I'm here the more I'm sure it's an actual, unfiltered, account of the truth. Somebody even went into the wall because they forgot to put their helmet on for a simple E.V.A. mission.

I once saw two neighbors arguing and was a bit worried, until I was informed that this happened. Every. Single. Morning. One of them had one flag on their property, the other one another, and apparently they *hated* each other. Only for the argument to end in ""Fuck you and see you tomorrow"". Whats even stranger is that sometimes they would borrow stuff from each other, insulting each other during the entirety of their conversations. I have since decided to either sleep in the lab, or to utilize the giant air-horn I requested be installed on my balcony, to shut them up (and wake up the entire neighborhood in the process). Yet, nobody ever complained. Upon closer inspection, I realized the flags were from some kind of science fiction series.

The laboratory they had made for me, however, was done with great attention to detail. All workspaces were of the correct height, the fume hoods installed better than in some that I've seen on Terra and there were seats that didn't ruin your back. The devices inside it - centrifuges, scales, fridges and the sort - were all not only new but *top of the shelf*. Building it must have cost them a fortune. The one thing that annoys me, however, was that they built it in the middle of a lake, meaning I had to take a boat there or hitch a ride on one of the many spaceships. And space ships they had enough - it was like a living museum. I've seen ships from every era of human space travel - even before space travel was a thing - including a so called ""*doodlebug*"", which looked neither like a doodle, nor like a bug. Somebody had taken ample inspiration from the design and built a space ship that looked somewhat similar, although it was a lot bigger. They had, of course, the Voyager One generational ship, claiming that ""if the original crew had boarded that ship, they all would've been dead within the first hundred years"" and that ""the original flaws were ironed out in the Voyager Two, which is the only reason these assholes survived"". Of course, they also claimed to have been the ones who informed Earth back then of the design flaws and how to fix them. Of course. They can't even decide what to run on their computers.

I soon got to work, after the mandatory ""vacation"" their Captains had forced upon me. Not that I'm complaining, getting some fresh air, good food and sunlight did improve my situation a lot. The pink guy came by, apologized profusely and left me a vial of blood claiming it was ""from one of the descendants of the original crew"". This was already weird, as the original crew was dead for far too long, just like the following generation. When asking about it, he evaded all questions and got annoyed, just saying ""It's legit, check it out for yourself"". After analyzing it and comparing it to more ... recent ... samples revealed he was telling the truth - although that would've required the crewman to have remained at an age of around twenty-seven for a small eternity.

They had also acquired samples from humans who, to their knowledge, never had any contact with the Squishies. For most it rang true and I do not want to know how they acquired said samples. There were, however, outliers that they could not explain.

I eventually was able to piece it together bit by bit, which took the majority of my time there. The other species must have had an advantage - something that was not denied by the planets inhabitants - in that they knew more about humans that humans did about themselves at that time. They must had mastered the editing of genes, although I am uncertain as why such a race would die out? Surely, they could've improved their situation on their own? Maybe they just didn't have the means to despite having the knowledge. Many of the planets inhabitants attempted to find the unknown races home world, but nobody did and eventually they came to the conclusion that ""there's only a dead star there"" and that ""their home planet didn't stand the test of time"" and ""that they left in a hurry after ignoring the obvious for too long, just like we did"". They had inter-weaved their genes with our own - which was already an accomplishment - but that they did it in a way that it would ensure the proliferation of life was even more interesting. Eventually, I was able to modify some cells to produce a few of those species eggs. When I asked for fertilizing material, Tay recommended to ask the pink guy, who declined as he had no trace of the Squishies in him, but he did offer me a *materials exchange some other time*. Pervert.

Eventually I found a donor with good material. The crew called his kind *the nocturnal*. His eyes were black, and there was something deeply unsettling about his teeth, to which he responded ""I don't drink blood"". For all intents in purposes, that's something that somebody who drinks blood would say. The first time some Terrans not affiliated with the Theseus or their acquaintances, they freaked out and called them all kinds of slurs. Some even drove stakes through their hearts, something about an ancient superstition of near-immortal monsters that feared the sunlight, drank blood and lived in the night. Meeting one of them at night for the first time (by chance) almost gave me a heart attack, but they turned out to be just as nice as the rest of the people here. The problem with the nocturnal was that they can't stand sunlight - they get sunburn rather easily, courtesy of their pale, slightly blue skin - and that they require much more iron in their diet than normal humans. Why exactly, I do not know. They tend to make a type of beverage, which is viscous and of a blood-red color, so I understand where the confusion comes from.  Anyways, I carefully made sure the eggs were fertile and incubated them. Then I turned to other matters, as there was nothing more I could do for the time being.

I decided to check out their messaging solution. It...was...archaic. They were currently discussing the name of their planet, of which there were many suggestions: ""Planet McPlanetface, Don't make a, Terra, Earth 2.0, Not-a-polluted-shit-world, Stay Out, Commonwealth Of Our Collective Human Interstellar Empire, Toll booth, Hell's reprieve, A Terran Municipality, ..."". None of them were particularly good. The pink perverts...perversions...were most...enlightening...in a way.

The Rakhar Tythor came by from time to time, making coffee and asking me how it went with my research. He was quite nice to talk with, although his views on the government I worked for were ... less than favorable. When I went to visit him once, I noticed a ""Resignation Letter"" directed towards the Galactic Senate printed out and framed on his wall - he insisted that this was for him what ""a title of academic achievement was for a Terran"". I wish it wouldn't have been censored, he must be quite creative with his insults. Of which there were a lot. I also came to know that he routinely stole the ship Captains best nutrient solution as a fertilizer for his coffee plant, of which he had grown another one, just to gift it to me. There was nothing wrong with the plant itself except for the fact that the solution had caused its berries to change color - they shimmered like a rainbow. Still, a nice house plant. I learned to roast it using the steam-rooms thruster from him and it made for the most delicious brew.

The clothes they had made for me - a wholly new experience, I couldn't ever afford a tailor nor did the government care enough to give me well fitting ones when I worked for them - fit very well. They did have a small itch to them in the beginning, but I got used to it. Tay insisted that ""the itch washes out after a while"". I have come to like this man, although his obsession with the pink guy was annoying. Sadly, each attempt at romance Tay failed for some reason. I guess he's happy with what he's got. A good cook, though. He took me once to some place in space, and it wasn't as dreadful as an experience as he'd told me it would be, but I did get a nice pipette out of it. Never made any mistake with it. The cosmic sentience that had gifted it to me said that ""it did exactly what had to be done"" and that ""mistakes were near impossible to make with it"" and was ""quite happy that I was one of the few humans to recognize it as a cosmic sentience, rather than a cosmic horror, without external input"". All it ask in return was to spread word of its divine being - something I agreed to since I believed it's claims unbelievable. I may have been wrong. I asked Tay on why they insisted on building the laboratory on a lake, to which he responded that ""it makes them sleep easier"" and ""they didn't want anything getting out, or worse, in"".

I checked on my experiments. Three of the eggs had fertilized and started to produce something that looked somewhat similar to tadpoles. Some of the planets inhabitants took a great interest in what I was doing and started helping where ever they could - even if they had absolutely no experience in the field. But they did learn quickly, doing nothing else but learning day after day.

Eventually, I asked their Captain, Süpö, what kind of political system there was on FUSS. After thinking for a while the Jyx responded that they were ""an autonomous collective, an anarcho-syndicalist commune, where everybody would take turns functioning an executive officer for a week with all the decisions made by said officer having to be ratified in a bi-weekly meeting via civil majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a 2/3rd majority in the case of more major affairs"". This didn't make any sense to me at all, as they certainly did have a rank of ""Captain"", to which the Jyx took great offense, insisting that it was pronounced ""Kapt'an"", or ""Kap'tan"" depending on which Kapt'an you were referring to. Each time a new ""Kapt'an"" was chosen, the apostrophe was to be shifted by one letter to the right. This meant effectively that Süpö was Kapt'an, the predecessor of which was Kap'tan, and the successor of which would be Kapta'n, with the procedure repeating from the beginning after the last letter was reached. Later on I learned that the Jyx was just parroting a piece of human media from long ago in order to prank me. The thing about the ""Captain"" and how they pronounced it, however, was true. Asking around I got conflicting results. While some claimed that FUSS was a monarchy (despite nobody being able to tell me who their king was), others were of the opinion it was a theocracy (despite there being a multitude of weird religions within the system, none of which was dominant, although something called ""Essixism"" was gaining traction), some said it was a democracy, while again others called it a ""conspiracy created in order to display to the galaxy a controlled opposition towards the Nation of United Terran States"", while again others called it an ""Utopia rooted in a classless society based on the ideals of communism"" only to be told that ""in actuality it was a form of socialism"", only to be interrupted and be lectured that it was a ""form of feudalism"" that was present on the planet...you get the idea. Nobody here knew anything about what they were actually doing, or how they ended up not only creating a society, but becoming a major independent system in the galaxy.

Hell's Retreat on the other hand does have a somewhat functional political system, however tribal it may be. They have elders, who they hold in high regards and skilled workers. They have hunters and Grrrooaakk herders. They have farmers, making something similar to flour back on Earth, and the delicious Ztarara or whatever it's called - plant that tastes like a potato crossed with a lemon. Strange, but not impossible to eat, especially if you know how to cook it. It grows above ground - like a lemon tree, but in the form of round tubers hanging from its stem, like a potato. They have a mixture of skilled medical professionals and shamans, the latter of which emerged when investigating the many plants on the planet, some of which were highly poisonous, some hallucinogenic and some just plain weird. I would, however, recommend not to go to a dentist on Hell's Retreat. They also tend to be the places *blacksmiths*, and being treated by them is about as painful as one may imagine, although they have plants against the pain. It's hit or miss if they work. I have a tooth made of Grrroooaakk tusk now. Generally, I prefer that planet, as the probability of accidentally suffering the consequences of somebodies stupid experiments is much lower.

When I asked Rakke, the perverted pink guy, what political systems were in place on FUSS, Terran planet, he simply shrugged and replied that he never much thought about it, as ""it seemed to work so far, so why change anything?"". Curiously, Rakke shared the rank of ""Captain"" with the Jyx Süpö - something that they had agreed on since some humans on board demanded a human captain. To my surprise the pink guy was pretty young when they made him captain and they only did so because there was nobody else around who wanted to be in that position at that time. His first official act as captain was ""trolling the Terran Federation"", the predecessor of the Nation of United Terran States. I then asked Rakke about his tendency to clothe himself in pink garments, to which he responded that ""it was a manly color"" before eventually admitting that the people of his family constantly washed his clothes wrong and they should actually be ""white, or a sleight beige at best"". He assured me they were doing this on purpose. Confronting Tay with this in private resulted in confirmation: Roxxa and him did so because they thought it was funny. Their daughter also found this to be most hilarious.

My experiments succeeded, and two of the tadpoles had matured. At first they looked somewhat similar to frogs, eventually maturing into a humanoid creature, with six fingers in total and the same amount of toes and blueish glittering skin. Some people on FUSS had started working on suits of these individuals, so that they may one day walk amongst the Terrans of the planet. I never did have the heart to tell them that first two successful experiments were to be terminated - I couldn't bear the idea *of the last/first two of a kind* being synthetically created, unable to mate due to their similarity. It would've been cruel and might have ended in incest, which would cause the species to degrade quickly. So I told the nice people of FUSS that they had died soon after their ""birth"", which wasn't a complete lie. The solution to this problem came when a rouge artificial intelligence from Terra contacted me through a variety of means. From the data I had provided it was able to come up with some novel solutions to the diversity problem - although I still do not understand how. Every time I asked it to explain it's findings, it answered with a new way to prepare an onion. Desperate for another success, I tried what it had suggested - Tay was more excited about the whole onion thing. Both worked - the recipes for onion preparation as well as those for genetic preparation - in most cases, anyways.

The new batch of experiments developed much slower than my earlier ones - the AI attributed that to ""the removal of most unnecessary human genetics"" - and they remained in their frog-like form for much longer. This time the AI actually gave me a sensible explanation: The Squishies used to live for far longer than humans, the time required for them to mature was much longer (around fifty human years to mature to an adult stage, then they lived up to 250 more years). When they combined their own with the humans, the Squishies must have made the decision to *give up the survival of their own species* as they knew they couldn't develop as fast as humans. This gave the humans aboard the Voyager One a better chance of survival, but would almost certainly result in their own extinction, aside from the few traces they left in the humans biology. *Why* they would do this I never found out, as they had absolutely nothing to gain from it. Maybe they knew they were doomed anyways and wanted their last act as a species be one of kindness. From the stories of the Theseus, I gathered that maybe they just wanted to repay kindness with kindness, that they had explained to the humans back then that their species was doomed to go extinct anyways.

The new batch of Squishies I let mature. However, I never did get to see the full extent of the fruits of my labor. The Squishies matured much slower now and stayed longer in their frog-like development stage. I couldn't return back to Terra, my last contact with my former boss *did not end well*. Once again, the pink guy had saved my life, that's all I have to say about that. That my previous research all burned up during the machine revolution is unfortunate, but maybe it's for the better. I heard the machines were *extremely mad* when finding the complex. I also heard they crucified my former boss against the laboratories walls before setting it ablaze, claiming that ""if he believed himself to be a savior by doing such horrible things, he should die a matyrer"", whatever that may mean. It wouldn't be until after many, many years later that a nocturnal would show up in the middle of the night, back at my new home on Hell's Retreat, where I had decided to stay after all that happened - I did like Tays food, and FUSS wasn't really my kind of place. The nocturnal came in the presence of a strange being. I recognized it as a Squishie, although not fully matured yet. It already had arms and legs, and could speak, although it had troubles with pauses between words, so it spoke rather slowly and monotonously. My nocturnal visitor seemed used to this, but to be honest it annoyed the hell out of me. Anyways, it was a being not unlike a human, although a good bit taller, with a head not dissimilar to a frog or a toad. The visitor also told me that ""the people of FUSS took good care of my children"", and that ""many adopted a Froggie, Toady or Squishie or whatever they decided to call them in order to watch over them until they matured"". I had left them all my research and was told the Squishies were eternally grateful and would continue my work in order to ensure the survival of their species.

Glububit read the inscription upon the stone. It was of a very dark color and it contrasted with the golden inlay that had been renewed often, almost as if the stone was placed there yesterday. Like many Shrrrebit, as the species came to call itself after the matriarch who had left the last traces of their kind many, many years ago, Glububit decided to do a pilgramage to their species site of revival. Then the Shrrrebit walked to the town square, where the inhabitants of the planet had erected the ""Statue of Tri-Unity"": A Shrrrebit holding a black sphere to the sky, while being gently embraced by a human. A human, who Glububit assumed to be no older than 28 human years, stood infront of it as well. Eventually, the human muttered: ""So...they finally did it. *Mother* would be so proud of us, don't you think?"".

""Mother?"" Glububit inquired.

""Yeah, *Mother*. Your kind called her Shrrrebit, but my brothers and sisters just called her *Mother*. She gave birth to us, in a way, you know? Anyways, I'm tired. Do you know how exhausting it is to keep up with language over more than a thousand years?"" the human smiled sentimentally.

Glububit looked at the human, then at the statue and back at the human. The similarity was striking.

""Are you...a descendant of that man?"" Glububit eventually asked, pointing to the human statue.

""Descendant? No..."" the human blushed, ""I am that man"".

""But how? I know your kind doesn't live that long!"" Glububit protested.

""I ... I decided to become a guardian"" the human began, ""*Mother* gave birth to us. Your kind has helped our ship(s) to persevere, at the cost of their own species. The only ones who knew about what your species had really done for us, how they sacrificed themselves so we may survive and continue our journey, were *Navigator* and *Skeman*. They never brought it over their hearts to tell the crew. Skeman died relatively soon after, but before Navigator joined him in the wall, he entrusted it all to me. Actually after he died, in a way. And I was lucky enough to survive long enough to meet the divine Essix, who kept me alive. Essix agreed to keep my secret, and over time, I'd seed the legend anew if it was about to be forgotten, when the fleet-ship came along. It was painful, you know? I've seen them grow up, have families and friends and then die. Over and over again. A luxury I could not afford. At first I had decided to forget everything each new day, but it drove me mad. So I came to an understanding with the divine. And then I had to learn to live with it. It was ... lonely, having no company but a cosmic sentience."" the human reminisced while Glububit became increasingly sadder, ""Then one day I met this Jyx. Not only the first Jyx Kapt'an of the fleet-ship, but as much a *world-builder* as a *world-eradicator*. I entrusted my knowledge to it. And, to my surprise, *it and it's human son actually did something, found Jane, and the rest is history*."".

""But why?"" Glububit asked holding back tears, ""Why sacrifice so much just to bring an exitinct species back to life?""

""Why sacrifice your own species to save another?"" the human rebuked, ""*Mother* and her people *raised us*. And we promised them. It may have taken a small eternity, but we did."".

""You took all of this upon yourself just to ensure the promise was kept?"" Glububit cried.

""Yes"" the human gently affirmed, ""our species potential does not lie in the fact that we're terribly good at waging war, or telling the gods themselves where to stick it, or any of that. *We just are*. Sometimes we're in the right place at the right time and sometimes we're in the wrong place at the wrong time for all the wrong reasons. The potential of our species is not that we were raised by 'a planet that, at every given chance, wanted to kill us'. I find this unfair to the planet, for it is bountiful and gives ample opportunity to survive."".

""Then what is it? Your potential?"" Glububit inquired.

""I do not know either"" the human admitted, ""I just did what I felt was right. Your species showed us *kindness* and I wanted to repay that. So did the crew of the fleet-ship Theseus. And we did. And now *you're here*. Your kind once thought to be extinct, yet you stand here, because some stupid human thought *that your species plight was unfair* and decided to do something about it"".

""So it's kindness?"" Glububit collected herself.

""Maybe, maybe not. Was it kindness that led Jane to kill the first two of her experiments? I do not know. Some would say what she did was highly unethical. I've had over a thousand years to think about this and I have not found an answer. All I came to conclude is that *we just are, and that's alright*."" the human responded humbly with a warm smile.

""I think *Mother* would be proud of what you accomplished. W-what will you do now, that you have fullfilled your task?"" Glububit muttered.

""I will *live*. I have around 60 more years in me, if all goes well. I will *explore places* like I intended to since I was a little kid. I will go to all those places the few select Theseus crew I spoke with have told me about. That's what I'm doing right now. Rakke told me of this place before he passed into the wall. And of Hell's Retreat, his home. What will you do?"" the human answered.

""I...I don't know"" the Shrrrebit admitted, ""I was hoping to find some purpose here, where my species was reborn. What's your name, by the way? I don't see it anywhere on the statue, and I have seen no mention of you in the memorial stone?"".

The human grinned. Before it could answer, Glububit said: ""Don't answer that. After all you've done, after you've watched over us for so long, I will call you *Father*."".

The human smiled again. It did that a lot. It looked upon Glububit and stated: ""Oh my, child, how much you have grown. I remember when your kind was nothing more than a bunch of frog-like things. Would you like to join me for some tea? We also have cookies. I wish to visist an old friend. And after that, if you'd like, we may go on an adventure together?"".

Glububit accepted the invitation, but wished to go to the wall first, to remember those who had made her existence possible in the first place. ""It's nice here"" she thought. Some of the more scientifically inclined Terrans had found a treatment that allowed her to breathe the planets atmosphere without a specialized device and had asked nothing in return.",2,1729551282.0,u_Frosty_Incident666,0,1.0,False
