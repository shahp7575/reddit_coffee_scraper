1hpiez2,https://www.reddit.com/r/paroxetine/comments/1hpiez2/mom_58_is_experiencing_dementialike_symptoms/,Mom (58) is experiencing dementia-like symptoms. Could this be Paxil?,"Full disclosure, dementia doesn’t run in my family but my mom doesn’t really take great care of herself. Diet is pretty standard for an American, she is overweight, doesn’t exercise, and is pretty sedentary. However, she started taking Paxil a few years ago and initially loved it. She described it as seeing the world in Technicolor for the first time - like in the Wizard of Oz.

A few months ago, however, she started exhibiting symptoms similar to early onset dementia. She has been burning herself while cooking, forgetting things, and says it takes her a half hour just to complete the steps to make coffee on some days. She brought this up with her doctor who promptly took her off it cold turkey (bad idea, but that’s the VA for you). Obviously she didn’t like that so she switched doctors who told her it couldn’t be the Paxil and put her back on it.

I’ve told her there’s a better way to quit Paxil through slow tapering but she’s pretty traumatized from the cold turkey incident and doesn’t want to. I’m torn; on the one hand, i’m so glad she’s finally gotten some respite from the depression she’s suffered from her entire life, but on the other hand, is this any better? I feel this drug is slowly killing her.

Has anyone else experienced this?",1,1735545770.0,paroxetine,0,1.0,False
1hpie1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1hpie1a/im_still_in_shock_from_this_conversation_and/,Im still in shock from this conversation and never thought I’d be posting here,"I never expected to be posting in this subreddit, and the conversation from a few hours ago with my MIL has got me so shaken up. I married my husband about a year and a half ago and we have an (almost) 1 year old (met about 2.5 years ago) a little background: my husband moved from Utah to South Carolina in 2022, we met within a month of him moving and we were an instant match, our first date lasted 6 hours and they had to kick us out of the restaurant at closing time because we couldn’t get enough of each other. In the summer 2023, we invited his mother for her second trip - but first to meet me - it was non eventful, we did typically things, hiking, zoo, bowling, dinner - she was quiet but seemed nice and a little awkward. Flash forward to January 2024, I had our daughter 2 months early and his mother flew in to visit us and our daughter in the NICU (besides being freshly postpartum and the scare of having a baby in the hospital) the interactions with MIL were uneventful as well. We had dinner a couple of times and she got to see our daughter - she didn’t get to hold her because she was still in an incubator and only 5 days old -  (my husband hadn’t even held our daughter yet) 
This current trip she has been visiting since December 26th and leaves January 1st. I thought this trip had been just a normal trip - visiting the aquarium, a museum, dinner and her FINALLY getting to interact with our daughter at almost a year old. Little did I know she has been as she said “biting her tongue the entire time” my husband went out earlier to get coffee and finish some laundry at a laundromat (our apartment has shared washers) and when she got to our apartment, instead of coming upstairs, she noticed one of cars was gone, tracked his phone and immediately went to the laundromat. That didn’t strike me as too weird, I just felt bad that she thought she couldn’t come upstairs if he wasn’t home. I was hoping she would feel welcome and feel like she could come whenever she pleased. (While she was driving to him, I called my husband and told him she just drove away and I didn’t know if she felt upset it appeared that we weren’t home or that she didn’t feel she could come to so I suggested he call her to sort it out and make her feel welcome) he calls me back and I ask if he apologized to her and expressed that she can come over and before he can respond she jumps on the call with her voice shaking but very aggressive and is biting my head off saying she wants to visit with HER son and she doesn’t need me to be interrupting their alone time talking. This threw me for a loop…that was not at all how she had been previously, she also never expressed wanting to be alone with him, he’s been off work all week and I work from home so we’ve been together spending time with her. I called my mom and explained it to her and just that I was confused and upset and she told me to go get a coffee and cool off once they arrived at the apartment (so MIL could see our daughter and I could clear my head) so they arrive and she’s acting completely bubbly and showing us a new stroller she had gotten our daughter and I quickly say I have to mail some packages and run out for a moment (something I actually had to do for my small business) so I’m polite and leave. When I come back, everything seems fine and we go to dinner, dinner is boring and fine. Then when husband & I are driving home he tells me about their conversation and says my MIL thinks I don’t do enough for our daughter and that I’m not pulling my weight, that me working at home is not a real job and I’m obviously confused and upset by this, my husband & I talked for an hour about all of it and then I asked if he wanted to go talk to her and squash this, I don’t like people being upset and I’d rather lay an issue on the table and resolve it. He suggested going to her Airbnb to resolve this tonight and when he called to let her know she’s clearly annoyed & bothered. Once we arrive she’s standing on the sidewalk and as soon as we walk up to her she starts going off saying that I’m clearly insecure, this was a private conversation between her & her son that had nothing to do with me, she’s worried for his wellbeing, I’m controlling & forced him to bring me to her to talk, I don’t have a real job, I’m faking feeling bad for a year as an excuse to be lazy (I’ve been having bad dizzy spells since I had my daughter and have gone to all kinds of specialists trying to find out why), she even said if I REALLY do feel bad then I am unfit to care for my daughter during the day, says her son is unhappy, we clearly need counseling oh and this threw me she said “it was a gut punch to learn I was pregnant” because as a teenager my husband expressed not wanting children (we’re 27 currently btw) this is so weird to me and I feel like she may just not like me because she contradicted herself a few times. I was a little hurt my husband didn’t interrupt and defend me or our marriage. But the worst thing is as soon as we got back in the car to go home my husband broke into tears, I’ve never seen him cry like that and seem so…broken I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to see her but is so afraid of her he can’t say it, I don’t want to be around her or have her around our daughter. We had no issues a couple of days ago except for normal stress like paying bills and wanting to move soon and I feel like she completely stirred the pot. Also I knew my husband had been physical and verbally abused my his dad growing up but I had no idea his mom was also verbally abusive and mean. What do I do moving forward? What does he do? Thankfully she’s going home to Utah Wednesday but I don’t think I can be around her again ever.

I was always skinny and naturally toned and then covid happened. I honestly didn't even realize I was gaining weight because I was working from home during the lockdown, mostly wore sweats, didn't really go anywhere, and never had to think about my weight. Even post-Covid I didn't think anything of it until I looked at old pictures and was like girllll, what happened? 😂

Anyway, I did 12 long laps around my complex. My legs were already dying after 2. By the 4th lap it seemed to be better, but in retrospect maybe it was because I couldn't feel them anymore 😂 So, here it is day two, I swing out of bed, stand up, and immediately fall to the ground like a puppet who lost its strings. 

And I'm just wondering...is that normal? I'm just sitting here at the edge of the bed, legs heavier than anvils, dangling like wind chimes. I want to go make coffee, but I think my only option is to fall to the ground and pull the useless cargo that is my bottom half.

1hpi9w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hpi9w2/how_to_choose_furniture_that_matches_your_homes/,How to Choose Furniture That Matches Your Home’s Aesthetic,"Your furniture is a reflection of your personal style and plays a significant role in shaping your home’s aesthetic. Choosing the right pieces not only enhances the visual appeal of your space but also ensures comfort and functionality. Whether you prefer timeless elegance or sleek modern vibes, this guide will help you choose furniture that perfectly matches your home's aesthetic.

# 1. Define Your Aesthetic Vision

Before you start shopping, it’s crucial to identify the style you want for your home. Here are some popular aesthetics to consider:

* **Modern and Minimalist:** Clean lines, neutral colors, and functional designs.
* **Contemporary:** A mix of trends with bold shapes and innovative materials.
* **Classic and Timeless:** Traditional designs with intricate details.
* **Bohemian or Eclectic:** Vibrant patterns, textures, and a mix of global influences.

Knowing your aesthetic helps you narrow down your choices and find pieces that harmonize with your vision. For example, [ivory sofas](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/christina-sofa-white) work beautifully in modern and contemporary spaces, offering elegance and versatility.

# 2. Focus on Key Furniture Pieces

Key furniture pieces like sofas, dining tables, and beds are the foundation of your decor. Invest in high-quality items that complement your style and stand the test of time.

* **Living Room:** A sleek **ivory sofa** is a versatile option that fits both contemporary and modern interiors. Pair it with a statement coffee table and textured cushions for a curated look.
* **Dining Room:** Look for [contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) like glass-top tables or minimalist wooden designs with clean edges to enhance your dining area.
* **Bedroom:** Choose a bed frame and nightstands that balance comfort and design. For a modern touch, opt for upholstered headboards and sleek bedside tables.

# 3. Balance Functionality and Style

While aesthetics are important, your furniture should also serve your practical needs. For instance:

* In small spaces, multifunctional furniture like storage ottomans or extendable tables is a great choice.
* For busy households, stain-resistant fabrics on sofas and durable finishes on tables ensure longevity.

When searching for the perfect piece, visiting a [home furniture shop near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) allows you to test for comfort and quality before making a decision.

# 4. Play with Colors and Textures

Color and texture play a crucial role in creating a cohesive look. Neutral tones like beige, gray, and ivory are versatile and timeless, making them a popular choice for furniture. A classic **ivory sofa**, for example, pairs beautifully with bold accent colors or metallic decor.

Mixing textures like velvet, leather, and wood can add depth and interest to your interiors, especially if you’re leaning towards a [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) aesthetic.

# 5. Incorporate Statement Pieces

To give your home a designer feel, include a few standout pieces. These could be a bold armchair, an intricately designed console table, or a sculptural coffee table. Statement pieces add character and can often be found in **contemporary furniture** collections that emphasize unique designs.

# 6. Adapt to Your Space

Scale and proportion are vital when choosing furniture. A small living room might feel overwhelmed by oversized furniture, while a large space needs bigger pieces to avoid looking sparse.

**Design Tip:** If you’re furnishing a compact space, consider light-colored furniture like **ivory sofas** and low-profile designs to make the room feel larger and more open.

# 7. Shop Strategically

Finding the right furniture requires some research. Start by exploring local stores by searching for a **home furniture shop near me**, where you can see and feel the pieces in person. For those who prefer the convenience of online shopping, many stores also offer virtual consultations and a wide range of styles.

**Why Choose Modern and Contemporary Furniture?**

Modern and **contemporary furniture** are ideal for those who value clean lines, innovative materials, and versatile designs. These styles often feature neutral palettes, making it easy to blend with other decor elements. For instance, pairing **modern furniture** like a minimalist dining table with mid-century chairs can create a chic and functional look.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing furniture that matches your home’s aesthetic doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By defining your style, focusing on key pieces, and balancing functionality with design, you can create a space that’s both beautiful and practical. Whether you’re looking for a statement **ivory sofa**, timeless **contemporary furniture**, or searching for a **home furniture shop near me**, the right choices will transform your house into a home.

1hpi8nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hpi8nc/my_new_neighbors_had_a_strange_tradition_of/,My new neighbors had a strange tradition of telling late night stories. I had no choice but to listen. ,"I moved to a neighborhood in a small town  North of Denver about a year ago. I had just gone through a pretty nasty divorce at the time, and I needed a house small enough that I could afford on a single salary and that was far enough away from my ex's family that they wouldn't come around bothering me.

The house itself was an 1100 square foot little bungalo, and it was the last house on the block before it turned into a dead end. Beyond that was a small forested area, densely packed with trees but still not fully concealing the sounds and lights of the expressway. 

My neighbors were a mix of young families and retirees, and I had no issues with any of them. 

One afternoon, a couple of weeks after moving in, I was unpacking the last of my boxes and trying to figure out the inner workings of my new steam cleaner when there was a knock on my door. 

Sweating, and with a homely bun on top of my head, I opened the door to see my neighbor, Sarah, smiling warmly and elegantly. She held the stems of two wine glasses between the fingers of one hand. In her other hand, a bottle of white wine. 

Sarah and I had hit it off the first day I moved in. She was sweet and hilarious. I welcomed her in, but we eventually settled into two folding chairs on the front porch, drinking wine and chatting about nothing of significance. 

Halfway through the bottle of wine, Sarah cleared her throat and mindfully crossed her legs into a criss cross position, rotating slightly more towards me. She smiled at me sympathetically, and it caught me a bit off guard. 

Laughing softly and awkwardly, I asked her what she was thinking. 

""I'm really hoping someone's told you already. Because if not, I have to tell you and...."" She trailed off, laughing uncomfortably and tucking her hair behind her ear. She stared at her hands for a moment.

""What are you talking about?"" An irrational thought that it had something to do with my ex intruded my mental space, and my heart began hammering in my chest as I fought to keep Sarah's gaze.

""Has anyone said anything to you about the knocking at night? Anyone from the HOA or another neighbor?""

""N-no. Knocking?"" I stammered, feeling a little tipsier than I'd planned to and swiveling a bit towards Sarah.

""It wouldn't have started yet, but soon. Somebody- people have been knocking on our doors late at night. Every night.""

""Who?"" 

She shrugged, meeting my eyes with another sympathetic look. 

""I mean, are they doing anything malicious?"" 

""No."" She said, keeping the shape from the word on her lips for a few seconds and avoiding my eyes. ""No, nothing like that. They... well- I guess they're *stories*? Like poems, riddles, confessions...""

""Sarah! What the hell.."" I laughed, truly feeling that she was messing with me. ""People are just opening their doors late at night, all willy nilly, and just listening to these random ass people's stories. Okay. Thank you for the heads up."" 

""No I- I *know* how it sounds. I really do. And if you don't believe it, okay. But I wanted to tell you because when you hear the knocking, probably tonight, you shouldn't ignore it. You have answer and you have to *listen*. Okay? You listen until they're done, no matter what they say.""

Sarah was... expressionless. I could see clearly that she was in fact *not* being  mischievous and silly and she was not amused by her account of the knocking. 
I began to consider that she may have had a mental difference and was experiencing a delusion or something similar. But I could feel that it was real to her. 

""Okay, Sarah. I'm sorry I laughed, and I hear you.""

She nodded and patted my knee softly, stood up and said she was headed home. 

My eyes wide in disbelief, I got up quickly and walked into my house as Sarah walked away towards her own, neither of us caring to retrieve the empty wine bottle or glasses.

I spent the rest of the evening stepping over boxes instead of moving them, snacking on various items straight out grocery bags, and watching true crime documentaries on YouTube. 

Halfway through a Dahmer body language analysis, I heard a soft rap on my front door, and my bloodstream filled with a moderate amount of adrenaline. 

*No way, no way, no freaking way*

I said aloud to nobody at all, hobbling over to the front door with my left foot asleep.

I looked through the small window on the front door and saw a relatively small and normal looking old woman peering back at me. She wore a lilac sweater and pearls around her neck. I opened the door, frustrated but curious. 

""Hello.""

""Hello, Miss. Welcome to the neighborhood. I'm sure you feel this is a bit unorthodox, but it happens to be time for our visit if you'll have me.""

I was about to *have* a heart attack. The lady herself was totally nonthreatening. But the circumstances had me feeling a strange numbness and shock about the situation.

 Had I moved into the neighborhood of a cult? Maybe it was a crazy tradition, but Sarah hadn't spoken about it the lovingly, slightly embarrassed way you might expect someone to talk about their weird home town traditions. 

She was...somber. 

""I'm not dressed, but I can listen from here.""

The lady nodded politely and began.

""I've written you a poem."" She looked quickly up at me with a girlish smile of pride. She reached into her sweater pocket and pulled out a small, folded paper. 

I nodded, trying to hide my anxiety and impatience.

""A small undertaking grows greater,
When idleness feeds the weight of later.
Each moment passes, a silent loss,
Stealing time, what is the cost?""

The woman peered past me into my living room, her gaze meeting a stack of boxes piled next to my coffee table covered in grocery bags and opened snack containers. 

""Sorry, just moved in."" I said, smiling.

""Five days ago, dear."" 

""Are you finished?"" I asked, no longer hiding my irritation. 

She nodded, her eyes meeting mine with what seemed like authority. 

I closed and locked the door, turning towards my living room and feeling the hot sting of anger and insecurity rise up my spine. I wasn't offended by the old lady's judgement, but triggered by it. 

Nolan used to walk in the front door, scan the house, and berate me for every unfinished chore. 

*lousy bitch. Sad excuse for a woman*

The little mantra of *he can't hurt you anymore* doesn't do much for the deep -seated learned belief that those things are, in fact, true. 

It didn't matter if he wasn't here to think these things about me. I believed them now. 

I fell asleep the same way I spent the day: on my couch surrounded by snacks and boxes with YouTube's algorithm crafting me an ongoing cocktail of educational and disturbing entertainment.  

I wasn't a procrastinator. Objectively, I was probably going through the natural ups and downs that come with moving. 

What I was, however, was extremely well versed in self-sabotage. If Nolan and that nosy old lady thought I was too messy, taking too long to unpack, I would be the **messiest** bitch they'd ever seen. I'd live out of these boxes forever.

I spitefully moved through the house the following morning, no longer stepping over boxes but forcefully pushing them out of the way with my feet. 

*I think I'll spend time in the garden today*

So I spent the entire day doing yard work. I pulled weeds. I swept away the gritty powder of leaves that fall left behind on my driveway. 

I pondered watering the grass, wanting to make the rest of the lawn more even with a large, much greener and healthier looking patch near the back gate. But it was becoming too cold, and it might all be different come spring. 

I worked all day because I wasn't going to unpack the boxes, and I didn't want to think about the next nighttime visitor.

One knock. One poem from a frail old woman and I was officially spiraling. I was fighting the delusion that these visitors had something to do with Nolan. I knew it couldn't be, and I yanked that belief out of my mind with every weed I pulled until my arms ached and sweat stung my eyes.

*Weird west coast hazing bullshit*

I finally came inside to shower and eat. I opened a fifth of whiskey I'd gotten as a moving in gift, downed half, and crashed on the couch. Boxes untouched. Dahmer's droning midwest accent playing over the silence, and container of spinach dip starting to smell sour. 

But the yard looked fantastic. And the rest of the lawn would catch up to that beautiful emerald green patch someday.


Around 1 am, there was a knock on my door. Expected, but startling nonetheless. 
I got up slowly,  the liquor sloshing in my stomach. So quickly accumulated that it didn't even have a chance to disperse. 


Again, I looked through the window first, squinting nauseously against the front porch light.

*The damn wine glasses and bottle are still there.*

Standing on my porch, slightly more intimidating than the nosy old hag was a young man who looked to be about 25. He was fit and tall and clasped his hands behind his back like a business grad at a job fair. 

As I opened the door, he moved a few strands of his dark hair away from his eyes and gave me a friendly looking smile.

""Mam."" He spoke in a lilted voice. 

Being half drunk, half sick, and half asleep, I skipped the pleasantries and gestured for him to share his story. 

He unfolded a perfectly neat piece of paper, looking a bit embarrassed and eager.

I almost kind of liked him. 

""A riddle. It's- it's a riddle"" he said, looking up at me and back down at the paper a couple of times. 

""I offer you escape when you feel pain.
I leave you empty, but you come back again. What am I?""

I squinted my eyes at him, unsure of how to read him and unsure whether he was reading me. 

""Jameson, apparently."" I said.

I don't remember the moment his smile went from nervous and friendly to full-blown contempt, but I felt it in my chest.

""It smells as if that's the case."" He spoke, his voice flat and disgusted. 

I slammed and locked the door, cursing the man and stomping back to my place on the couch. But I couldn't sleep. My mind raced with flash backs of drunken fights and broken bottles. 

A sinking feeling of shame pulled me down and exasperated my nausea. 

*How many sick days did you use for no reason other than being hungover?*

*That was when I first left Nolan, I was just trying to survive.*

I drowned my thoughts with the remainder of the fifth.


The following afternoon, I awoke to a pounding headache and an extreme case of agitation. The ice machine's sound was an ice pick in my temple, and the heat was up too high. 

I'd had enough of my own shit and pulled myself of the couch, opened every window, and clung desperately to tylenol and Gatorade as I finally unpacked every box and cleaned the house. 

I was sick and sluggish. My insecurities were burning on the surface of my skin, and my anxiety was screeching in my mind. But I pulled through and made the house look a little more like home.

I traded the true crime videos for an exceedingly more wholesome Bob's Burgers and repeated the mantras my old therapist had equipped me with. 

*I am enough as I am.*

*Their words are a reflection of them, not me.*

I took a break to make a cup of tea and stared out the kitchen window into my backyard. A growing sense of pride filled heart that the house was becoming as beautiful as it's outdoor counterpart.  

I cocked my head, again noticing the lawn.

*How is that damn patch even greener yet? Why is the rest browning so fast? It's no less than 40 degrees.*

*I trust that everything will fall into place in time.*

Midnight was upon me in no time, and I tucked myself into my little bed on the couch, stretching my legs out and embracing comfort and rest. I felt more at peace with myself and my home. 

Just as I began to nod off, I heard the inevitable knock on my front door. The whole thing was getting old, but i wasn't going to let it get me upset again. 

I set an intention to treat whoever the visitor would be with kindness. I didn't understand or agree with this ritual, but I lived here now. I wouldn't take it personally and I would respectfully listen and go back to sleep.

I opened the door gently, peering at my visitor with curiosity. 

Black hair. Blue eyes. Collared shirt. 

My heart hammered in my chest and the sickening familiar sense of floating invaded my body. Something between vertigo and the seventh layer of hell. 

I knew it wasn't actually Nolan. But damn he looked a lot like him, and PTSD is one hell of a trip. 

My mouth went dry and I held onto the door frame aggressively. I nodded with everything I had left in me, urging the man to tell his story. 

""Hi. I know it's extra late, I'm sorry. This whole thing is a little silly right?"" He said, sensing my discomfort and smiling sympathetically. 

""It's okay.""

""Want to come sit? Here-on the porch? You seem very tired."" He gestured gently towards the chairs and the table that still held the wine bottle and glasses.""

*I'm sorry, I forgot again.*

""No. No it's fine. I can stand here."" I said.

""Great, okay. I have-actually I have a confession. But that feels a bit heavy so I'm going to make it into a game. Cool?""

He seemed perfectly kind, but I felt half-dead in my body and I wasn't interested in playing along. I nodded, nonetheless.  

""Okay I start with a sentence or two and you finish it.""

I actively pressed into the four corners of my feet like that yoga teacher taught me. 

""Ok.""

""When I feel overwhelmed, I like to-""

""Cry"" 

He chuckled warmly. 

""Okay, nice one. Okay- it's only fair for abusers to be-""

""Held accountable""

""Right! Can't argue with that. You're doing great! Even at the expense of-""

A cringe inducing ringing in my ears nearly put me on the floor. 

""What is this? Just-Can you just tell me your thing, I'm not feeling well. Please.""

""Okay, no worries. Thats a tough one. Last one, and it's just like a little poem Okay? You'll like it.""

*Slow deep breaths. I did the best I could with what I had.*

""His transgressions running around in my head.
I'm a mangled mess of the words he's said. 
Tear stained cheeks and eyes stained red.
He can't be stopped, so he has to be-""

I gathered every bit of power I had to slam the front door shut, but the man blocked it with both hands, pushing firmly and gritting his teeth. 

""He has to be- He has to be-?"" He shrieked, eyes bulging as his two hands countered the force of my entire body on the door. 

""Finish it! Finish it, dammit and be done with it. You need to let this go!""

""DEAD!"" I screamed, my voice breaking and threatening to tear my throat. 

""DEAD, he had to be dead. He couldn't be stopped so he had to be dead! It was him or me, you don't understand!"" I sobbed and slid down the door to the cold ground, rounding my body into a ball.""

I don't know when the man left. I dont know how long I lay on the wood floor with the front door wide open. And I don't know how long it'll be until they take me away. 

I'm staring out my kitchen window, smoking a cigarette. I don't remember where the greener patch of grass was. It's all covered in snow.

1hpi5ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hpi5ch/recommendations_for_espresso_machine_and_grinder/,Recommendations for Espresso Machine and Grinder [~1500€],"Hi everyone👋
My husband and I, we are based in Austria, decided to get us a decent espresso machine and grinder. We are currently using a Nespresso machine (his currently favourite due to ease of use) and I use Hario V60 and Aeropress, as I do not like pod coffee. Now we are willing to spend around 1500€ for a set up which is suitable for brewing decent Italian espresso and cappuccino. We both do not like light roasts (although I enjoy them on my V60) for espresso and mainly drink 4-10 espresso a day. My husband is a trained barista but he wants to keep it simple and manual, although we do not want a lever machine, as we prefer double espressos. He worked for a decade in a cafe and is used to professionally grade machines. But we both agreed that we would like a classic E61 group machine and a good hopper grinder with less automation as possible. As we are not functioning properly without our coffee in the morning the machine should heat up in 20min. We also looking for a timed grinder which we can dial in and then use with the setting until we change beans and which is easy to maintain and to clean. 
We highly appreciate your advice and experience!",1,1735544662.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

First, I want to say hello and I want to thank you for deciding to read onwards. To start, I'd like to informally introduce myself, I'm Cheems and I'm looking forward to build a meaningful and genuine connection with someone who desires the same and intends to make it work. 

  
To tell you something about my past, I have dated people before, but have not been in an official relationship yet... WAIT-- NOT because I fear commitment, but because the people I dated f\*\*\*ed up before we got there haha

Anyway, for some years, I abstained from dating because I got sick of spending my time and wasting it with the wrong people... but this year (or as the year is about to end) I have decided that I'm ready to give it a shot again and open my heart to someone who really deserves it.... By this, I mean someone who is also ready, committed, and interested to form a wholehearted, genuine and worthwhile relationship.   
  
And as to the pacing of this potential relationship, I'd prefer na slow burn. If we start to get to know each other, let us establish our expectations first and be good friends. Once we build the trust, we can meet up and hang out, and if we're really for each other, we can exclusively date.

So I have my self a new job in retail. While pay is not same as nursing, I continue to bring home almost same amount of money.

My birthday is January 1st and as many with birthdays around Christmas, my bday was never celebrated.

We always go away for my birthday.  I save and scrimp so that whole trip is paid for in cash and this includes spending money.

I do not ski and honestly don’t mind if he takes a day to ski (I am introvert and love aline time).  This just happened and I feel so sad because, the deal i was able to get won’t be available in a month. Because I always pay (and it’s my birthday, I just said fuck it). I canceled hotel and canceled couples massage I booked (he doesn’t know - it was meant to be a surprise)

He went to bed and came down stairs while I am having coffee.  Tells me 199 times he loves me (I feel like this is gaslighting).  Then gets angry with me because “As someone who always cancels, (he) thought I would understand.

It’s currently winter break halfway through my freshman year of college, I was randomly assigned a roommate cause I couldn’t find anyone that interested me online to room with. It was a red flag from the start that she never checks her email and I had to search to find her Snapchat to contact her, she didn’t even know our room number or floor during move in, she was moving in earlier than me and was calling me an hour before arriving on campus early in the morning when I was sleeping claiming she doesn’t know which room we were in (I’m surprised she even know which dorm building) cause she apparently never go to email sent to every single student months ago, which also told you your roommate’s name.

She is a complete mess, I get struggling mentally I do too but she often uses this as an excuse to ignore taking care of the room and partying until 4am every couple nights drinking a ton. Then she would come back hung over and leave all her shoes on my side where I get changed infront of my dresser, then she gets mad at me for waking her up cause I tripped on her shoes and fell while getting ready at 6am in the dark (all of her classes are online at noon) and she was always already up when I fell and made noise cause I could hear her typing on her phone under the covers. I will admit a couple times I did slam a drawer that was stuck but most of the time it was me falling from her shoes she put on my side on my rug.

Her and her friends would be sitting on my side of the room taking selfies despite me telling them not too, I see them posted on Snapchat. I have straight blond hair, I keep finding dark curly black hair all over my side, especially all over my bed (her and all her friends have black hair).

When I was visiting home she went onto my side of the room without permission and used my tuberware (proving she was going through my side of the room despite not knowing where the tuberware was), I came back three days later and found my tuberware dirty on her desk filled with food and beverage that had been sitting out. She once left a glass of wine out for almost two weeks and only stopped cause she got sick of our room having flies (despite me mentioning it multiple times).

She got upset when I told her she left an apple on her bed after a week cause I thought she forgot it there, this was more recently and she now sleeps in a friend’s room every night drinking and gossiping. Claimed I shouldn’t even look at her side of the room and yelled at me for it (through text message all caps with a bunch of exclamations).

I get it, it’s college our rooms don’t have to be perfect. But that doesn’t mean you should have all your clothes and purses laying in between our beds so I’m walking around and slipping and falling after stepping on her shirt. I don’t let friends into our room cause it’s so bad, her friends scold her for this constantly, keeping your mess on your side is one thing, but it’s another if it also covers half of my side of the room.

When she came back from parties at 4am she would bring friends into the room while I was sleeping talking loudly shining phone flashlights all over the room (including directly in my face) knowing I had to wake up in a few hours.

Her and her cousin would vape in the room despite me being against it, I have several asthma and my respiratory system is underdeveloped, I find it very difficult to breathe if I inhale a lot of the stuff and I’ve heard the smoke can ruin fabric. If she gets cause with a vape or alcohol in the room, we’ll both be expelled, the only acception to this would be if I found the alcohol or saw her vaping and reported it to the ras before she was caught. She let her ex walk around the room with athletes foot and then changed her story about it three times to trick me and I had to clean the whole room so we wouldn’t catch it. She then with said ex later on that night chose to do it while I was sleeping (another night where I had a 6am alarm), then acted like it was okay cause “yous was sleeping”, then claimed “we went straight to bed we never did anything”, then changed the story to “I thought you left the room an hour ago for a party” why would I leave for a party the night before a test at 2am, just because she ditched her classes and pretends to be sick constantly and will literally curse about the professor knowing her online test is recording her camera and audio doesn’t mean I do the same. Finals week instead of studying for her tests she was pulling all nighters until 1pm partying.

Whenever I have a problem with her she twists and manipulates everything to make me seem like the bad guy making up things to attack her, making it seem like I’m hallucinating from the lack of sleep she was causing. I confronted her about posting pictures sitting in my desk chair and step stool leaning against my bed and she immediately deleted the picture from her snap story and started claiming I was hallucinating and that she would never go on my side of the room. She also makes plans to go to her friends houses/dorms whenever I try to take to her about problems in person, always avoiding me by pretending to be late to a party or starting a face time call whenever I start talking about an issue.

When she kept losing her tv remote she started accusing me of touching it.

Multiple times when I left for home I gave her 3-5 days to clean her side of the room and told her that my parents would be helping me bring stuff in and that if they see a messy room it would leave a bad impression of her to my parents. I came back to find her side of the room even worse than before, and she for no reason was on my bed and knocked over all my blankets and pillows and just left them there and I was then scolded for it and called a lazy slob by my family who I knew wouldn’t have believe despite me being in shock to find my side a mess once I returned. She used my lamp and left it on when she went home, it was on for three days until I got back to campus, she could have started a fire. This isn’t as big of an issue but we used to both have our own water and paper towels, she now goes to my side and uses mine instead of buying more of her own, I get a few but when you drink half of my large pack or use a whole roll of paper towels and don’t bother to replace it with one of your own (that I know you have) so I’ll have too then it’s a problem. We agreed I’d bring the coffee maker and she’ll bring the vacuum, she brought her own so thankfully there’s no rules about have two coffee makers so we wouldn’t have been fined, she never used hers once. She would always use mine, use up all the ice in my ice tray and just put the empty tray back in the fridge, would take up most of my side of the fridge along with her own side. When she used my coffee maker she always left her coffee bean cups in the machine and never put more water in, she would also take out the drip stop and never put it back on so I come back to see brown sticky residue on my coffee maker and desk.

Lastly, back when her and her ex were still dating she had him come over super late at night without asking me (cause I was sleeping). He was super loud, knocking bottles and stuff off of her desk for fun to make noise, banging her plastic reusable bowl together, shouting instead of whispering. While this was happening she also had the tv on and ran the microwave and I was pretending to sleep but was actually watching them with the covers pulled up high, she stood infront of the microwave watching until it stopped beeping to pull her food out. It was 2am, this went on until 4:30. She threatened multiple times to kick her (ex) boyfriend out of the room but wouldn’t go through with it cause I don’t think he even drives. I wish I got up and kicked him out instead of just laying there begging it to stop, I wish I went to get the ra, or went to my friends to sleep. When confronted (as always) she claimed none of it happened, said I was hallucinating or that it was all a dream, said that they watched the tv muted with captions and never made any noise and that she never ran the microwave or threatened to kick him out of the room. She sleeps until 5pm a lot so I feel like I can’t really go in the room, she claims it’s fine but I can’t turn a light on and working in a dark room with a desk lamp makes me very tired so I need to go to study lounges with uncomfortable old cheap couches with ac that doesn’t work.

Not as serious but she knows I do dnd and that I don’t like telling a lot of ppl about it, she met a bunch of people in our dorm, told them all about me, told them my best friend (who I have a picture with on my desk) as my bf, showed them all pictures of me so I have ppl I don’t know trying to talk to socially awkward me and ask about dnd. To make things worse she was still telling ppl my best friend was my bf knowing I recently broke up with mine for sa that she knew about. When I was still with my ex, her and her friend kept trying to peer pressure me into cheating on him with someone at college (he went to a different one) and wouldn’t stop sending me selfies of guys from our dorm shirtless trying to convince me to go on dates with them. I had to tell them to stop five times and stop taking to the irl until they actually started taking me seriously. She thought ive never drunken before and tried to peer pressure me into drinking with her and her cousin, she also is not trying to pressure me into getting tinder to get laid (I’m asexual). She also told all her friends I’m in the closet nonbinary and pan.

I don’t think she’d ever agree to a roommate agreement, she acts like we’re best friends but is super nasty when texting and does stuff like this a lot. I just have to push through and deal with her for another semester.

TLDR;
- shitty roommate,
- uses tuberware without permission and waited a whole week to clean it,
- leaves wine out for weeks and attracts bugs,
- waits until a week or two after I ask to only partially clean her side,
- makes herself super hungover drinking almost every night then pretends to be sick and makes her mess even worse,
- goes on my bed when I’m away,
- let bf walk around with fungal infection barefoot,
- did the dirty while I was sleeping in the room,
- keeps me up at night,
- giant piles of clothes covering the floor of both our sides,
- avoids any discussions about issues involving her or the room,
- parties until 4am very frequently and wakes me up every time she gets back,
- vapes in the room (I have very severe asthma and a very weak respiratory system from birth, the smoke also clings to fabrics and if she gets caught we’ll both be expelled with no exceptions),
- tried to peer pressure me to cheat on my ex,
- tried to peer pressure me into doing shots when she though I’ve never taken alcohol before,
- told all her friends about my private hobby (dnd) that I didn’t want others to know about,
- tells everyone my male best friend is my bf knowing I’m recovering from trauma from sa by my ex and that she is wrong,
- told all of her friends I was in the closet nonbinary and pan,

Did I ruin everything? I'm feeling miserable, please help!","Yesterday, my boyfriend(26m) and I(23f) had a huge fight because I told him I can’t keep giving him money all the time. He recently got a job a week ago. I knew from the beginning that he’s not financially stable, but that has never mattered to me because I believe time doesn’t remain the same for anyone. We’ve been together since 2020, but whenever there’s a topic of money, he starts acting weird—he stops talking to me, ignores my texts, and behaves coldly.

On December 24, we met because he came to my city for work. He was fasting, so I invited him for coffee because it was cold, and I wanted him to feel better and have some energy. While we were sitting at the restaurant, he asked me to show him my PhonePe balance. (Before this he said that he wanted a Casio watch, told me to order for him),  then I denied it at first because I knew if he saw it, he would spend it somehow. But he insisted, so I showed him. I had ₹3,500 left in my account. As soon as he saw it, he started saying loudly, “You’re not buying me this?” He wanted a T-shirt for the gym. I refused initially and tried explaining that I had saved that money, but he started creating a scene, saying, “You’re not buying it? Why?” People were staring, and I felt embarrassed. I asked him to talk slowly, but he said he only had one gym T-shirt and couldn’t keep wearing the same one every day. So, we went to a shop, and I bought him the T-shirt. He was happy and even said thank you then I went home.

Later on next day he asked me to pay for his tea, saying his account balance was in the negative, and I paid without saying anything  he sent me a number and asked me to transfer money for his tea , and I did that without questioning him. That night, he mentioned his birthday in January. He said he didn’t want anything special but then asked me to buy Ayurvedic ingredients like ashwagandha and safed mulethi etcto make a diet powder for him, which would cost around ₹1,500. He also mentioned that his grinder at home was broken, so he wanted me to prepare the powder at my place and give it to him. At that point, I told him it was too much because I had saved that money for myself and couldn’t afford to spend all of it on him.

What hurts me the most is that, in all these years, he has never made any special effort for me. He hasn’t given me a single gift on my last two birthdays, anniversaries, or even Valentine’s Day. His excuse is always that he doesn’t have money or that Valentine’s Day is a Western tradition and a waste of time. On his last birthday, I even asked him to at least stay awake till midnight, but he didn’t. I’ve never demanded anything expensive just his time, love, and effort.

On the same day, he sent me a picture of a hoodie in evening and asked if I was buying it for him?. When I didn’t reply, he deleted the messages. That night, I sent him a polite paragraph explaining that he should learn money management and that I can’t keep giving him money. I told him I’m not earning and can’t keep asking my parents for money every time he needs something. I thought he’d understand, but I was wrong.

He got upset and said, “What’s the point of saving if you can’t help someone in need?” He accused me of being selfish and greedy.
What hurt the most was when he compared me to his ex. He said his ex was better because, once, she gave him ₹800, which was all she had. He said she was “pure-hearted,” while I’m “clever and greedy.” This is the same ex who, according to him, used to abuse him. Now he says leaving her was a mistake. I couldn’t believe he was comparing me to someone from a one-year relationship when we’ve been together for almost five years.

Once, I gave him 3k, and he didn't pay me back for almost a year. When I asked him to return the money, he said, ""Why do you need the money?"" We had a fight, and I told him, ""Why should I tell you why I need it? I also have work to do, that's why I'm asking."" He then said, ""I gave you 3k before, remember?"" So, I sent him screenshots of all the payments. After that, he said, ""Okay, okay, now count it,"" and then stopped talking. He eventually sent me the money.

He said that he spent money too, that he’s always spent more than his means on me traveling 450 km, buying chocolates, flowers, and all that. I’m not saying he never gave anything, he did, but isn’t this just the bare minimum? He had to meet me too, right? My friend said these are just bare minimum things and I should know my worth. I’ve done so much for him and forgiven him so many times, but this time, he’s wrong, and all of this feels problematic from his side. But was I supposed to meet him alone? And flowers? I’ve only ever received two roses in all these years. Chocolates? That’s the bare minimum. He even said I should ask my parents to find me a rich guy because “all I care about is money.' 
I even apologized, thinking maybe I was wrong. But I’ve always helped him. I once gave him ₹2,000 to repay a friend for rent. I’ve supported him emotionally and financially, even when he lied to me multiple times.
But yesterday, he said so many hurtful things. He said I made him feel poor, that he hates me now, and that he doesn’t want to see my face ever again. He said he doesn’t want someone like me who helps just for show.
Now I’m questioning everything. Did I ruin my almost five-year relationship with that paragraph? Was it wrong of me to ask him to manage his finances properlu ? My friends are saying I’ve done nothing wrong and that he’s the problem. They think I’ve been giving him money to keep him emotionally available, but he’s not even emotionally supportive. They say if he doesn’t have money, he should learn to manage within his means instead of asking me repeatedly.I dont have any problem in helping in serious issues but this time he compared with someone One who used to abuse him I asked him then why did you left her he said it was a huge mistake and she was much better than me .

I love him, and I thought we’d enter 2025 together, I was ready to fight for him to marry him. But now, I feel completely broken.I don't hate him i wish best for him ,i hope he gets his US visa and everything he wished for , My mind is not processing this whole thing,Did I ruin everything by saying I can’t always give him money? Was I really wrong here?
I'm thinking if someone will ever truly understand and love me the way I yearn to be loved. I invested everything in this relationship, supporting him through thick and thin. Yet, the person I deeply loved now despises me, seemingly only caring about money.

All my efforts, all my love, seem to have been in vain, I'm sitting in class, struggling to hold back tears. We were supposed to meet today, but now everything is ruined.
I prayed for our marriage, did foolish things in the name of love, and what did I get in return? Accusations of being selfish and greedy. It's heartbreaking I thought he was the one, but once again, I was proved wrong!",7,1735543652.0,AskIndia,18,0.89,False

Whether you have a sprawling garden, a quaint balcony, or a spacious patio, the right furniture can help you design an inviting atmosphere for relaxation and socializing. With a wide array of options available at [outdoor furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), you can create a space that blends comfort, style, and functionality. Here's a guide to crafting the perfect outdoor living area using key pieces like [balcony furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), [garden furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), and [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan).

# 1. Start with a Vision for Your Space

Before diving into furniture shopping, envision how you want to use your outdoor area. Is it a peaceful escape for quiet mornings with coffee? A lively spot for entertaining guests? Or a versatile space that can accommodate both?

* **For Small Balconies:** Focus on space-saving **balcony furniture** like foldable chairs, compact tables, and stylish stools.
* **For Gardens:** Larger **garden furniture** sets, such as sofas, dining tables, and benches, are ideal for creating distinct zones for dining and lounging.
* **For Patios:** Opt for modular seating arrangements and statement pieces to balance functionality with aesthetics.

# 2. Choose the Right Furniture

The type of furniture you select plays a critical role in setting the tone for your outdoor space. Here's a breakdown of some popular options:

* **Rattan Outdoor Furniture:** Loved for its durability and timeless appeal, rattan furniture is perfect for adding warmth and texture. Whether it's a rattan sofa, a cozy armchair, or a chic coffee table, this style suits both modern and rustic spaces.
* **Garden Furniture:** From weather-resistant dining sets to stylish loungers, **garden furniture** should be sturdy enough to withstand the elements while offering maximum comfort.
* **Balcony Furniture:** Think multifunctional pieces like bistro sets or hanging chairs that save space without compromising style.

**Pro Tip:** Visit **outdoor furniture stores** for hands-on inspiration. Many stores showcase complete setups that can spark ideas for your own space.

# 3. Add Comfort with Textiles

Textiles are the secret ingredient to making your outdoor area feel cozy and inviting. Layer your furniture with outdoor-friendly cushions, throw blankets, and rugs in weather-resistant materials. Choose colors and patterns that complement your space and bring a sense of warmth.

# 4. Create Ambiance with Lighting

Lighting can transform your outdoor living space into a magical retreat once the sun sets. Here are a few ideas:

* String lights for a warm, romantic glow.
* Lanterns or candles for soft, flickering light.
* Solar-powered stake lights to highlight pathways or garden edges.

# 5. Incorporate Functional Decor

Functional decor adds personality and practicality to your space. Consider the following:

* **Planters and Greenery:** Add life to your space with potted plants, vertical gardens, or flower beds.
* **Side Tables:** Perfect for holding drinks, books, or decorative pieces.
* **Outdoor Rugs:** Define spaces and add a layer of comfort underfoot.

# 6. Protect Your Investment

Investing in high-quality furniture from **outdoor furniture stores** is essential, but maintaining it is equally important. Look for weather-resistant materials like aluminum, teak, or synthetic rattan, and invest in furniture covers to protect your pieces during harsh weather conditions.

**Why Choose Rattan Outdoor Furniture?**

Rattan furniture is a popular choice for outdoor spaces due to its lightweight yet sturdy construction. It’s perfect for both large gardens and cozy balconies, offering a sophisticated, natural look. Additionally, synthetic rattan options are highly weather-resistant, making them a practical choice for year-round use.

**Balcony Furniture Ideas for Small Spaces**

If you’re working with a limited balcony space, choose compact and multifunctional pieces:

* Foldable bistro sets for casual dining.
* Hanging egg chairs for a touch of luxury.
* Narrow benches with built-in storage to maximize functionality.

**Garden Furniture for Larger Spaces**

For expansive gardens, create separate zones with different furniture styles. Pair a dining table with chairs for al fresco meals, add a lounge area with a rattan sectional, and include a hammock or daybed for ultimate relaxation.

**Shop Smart: Outdoor Furniture Stores in Your Area**

Explore local **outdoor furniture stores** for high-quality options that suit your climate and lifestyle. Many stores now offer collections of **garden furniture**, **balcony furniture**, and **rattan outdoor furniture**, making it easy to find the perfect pieces for your space. Shopping in person also allows you to test the comfort and durability of each item.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a cozy outdoor living space is all about combining the right furniture, decor, and ambiance to reflect your personal style. Whether you’re furnishing a small balcony or a sprawling garden, prioritize comfort and practicality while making the space your own. With the variety of **garden furniture**, **balcony furniture**, and **rattan outdoor furniture** available at **outdoor furniture stores**, your dream outdoor retreat is just a few steps away.

At first it did not bother me because I had so much going on for me (school mostly) and I was so sure that at some point I'd meet someone. 

This year was particularly a hard one for me because in addition to my personal struggles, I witnessed a lot of friends get married, have kids, start a new relationship and find love. I was super stoked for them but I have noticed that friends tend to drift apart when they start new romantic relationships. All of these made me realize how empty my life really is and it's starting to affect me. I just wish I had my own person.

I'm surrounded by people who did as little as walk on the street, went to a coffee shop or attended some party and then boom! they met the one for them. Why hasn't the same happened for me?
For as long as I can remember guys have always approached me but for some reason they're never the type of guys I'm interested in. On the other hand, the guys that I find myself being attracted to don't feel the same way or there's always some issue that makes it impossible for things to move to the next level beyond just platonic friendship. 

I adore the concept of love, I can write epistles on the subject, that's how much I love LOVE, but sadly it has and still continues to elude me.

Yesterday, after a one wasted bag of coffee beans, I finally got a good shot of espresso and enjoyed it (with a size of 3 without changing the burr size). It was 19g and yielded 36g of espresso. Took 26 seconds of extraction time.

And today, I did make coffee with the same setting, and it was terrible. It was 19g, and yielded 26g of espresso. I changed the burr size to a 4, and grinder size to a 5. It yielded 28g. I took that shot and it had the aftertaste of sourness.

What could have gone wrong? I guess I could have gone wrong in tampering (too strong or too weak) but it just seems like too big of a change in taste and everything from tampering. Pressure is fine. I saw a suggestion that I could manually brew my shots by dialing in (as it took too little in extracting). I will try that tomorrow.

And also whenever I remove the burr, I first unlock the hopper, but I always struggle to clear all the remaining beans stuck in the burr before being able to taking it out. Am I supposed to empty the grinder by running it all out before taking the burr out?

Please help a struggling beginner out. As a coffee lover myself, been stressed out how hard it is to make a good shot of coffee.",1,1735542690.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Immensely grateful to the community, this is a mighty strong support group! as many, I have been lurking in this group for some months now, contributing just with the Congratulations! message, but definitely going through each of the failure and success stories and understanding what would be the kind of materials that will work for me.

As many have said, I had no idea how to exam was going, some easy questions, some tough questions and some questions I could neither make head or tail about.

Bit about me, 25+ years of experience, started out as a Systems Administrator and now working as IT Director. As many, I too found difficulty reading through the books, I preferred to read just to get more perspective on the areas which was difficult to understand or had limited explanations from the videos. I used multiple materials, not sure it was a good idea, as the steps for some of the processes were conflicting, but final say is OSG.

**Test Materials**

* QE – very significant investment in my preparation, I know its costly, particularly for exam candidates like me from India, but Quantum Exams completely changed how I read and comprehended each question. recommended, helps in building your analyzing skills. Many thanks u/DarkHelmet20 you are a blessing to many of us!
* LearnZapp – Did not buy, just did the 5 random free tests whenever I could, great to understand your weak areas and work on it. On phone and laptop
* PocketPrep – Did not buy, just did the free tests during free times, again both exams questions are not that hard as QE, but helps build your knowledge and identify weak areas, on phone.
* Thor Pederson - Udemy – Hard tests.
* Andrew Ramdayal - [50 CISSP Practice Questions. Master the CISSP Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbVY0Cg8Ntw) Good, some solutions are debatable, take a look though, recommended.
* Boson Exams - took multiple tests, wasn't happy with the interface, questions are too technical, and some questions feel out of domains but overall will enhance your knowledge.

QE, LearnZapp and Pocket Prep should be enough is what I think.

From my test experience, with proper preparation, perseverance, dedication this certification can be achieved. Experience also helps. Identify your weak areas and spend more time on those areas.

Either take the tests after studying one domain at a time and get to a good preparedness level or fully complete studying all domains and then start taking the test. I spend a few hours on test each day before completing studying all the domains, just couldn’t resist taking tests! I got a lot of low marks, but kept on it, whichever works for you, just sharing.

Many! Many! Many! thanks and love to each and every one contributing to this great community, I have immensely benefited by the many posts and messages in this group. **Namasthe!**

1hphmfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/theotherwoman/comments/1hphmfr/not_sure_how_to_proceed/,Not sure how to proceed..,"I (27F) met MM (39) online about 6 months ago. We started with just chatting and then moved to being on the phone with each other constantly. He would call me as soon as he was awake, making coffee in the morning, all hours of our work day, and pretty much any time his wife was not around. MM was always transparent to me about his marriage and children- he claimed that they got married a little over 15 years ago and mostly stayed together because of kids who are both under 18. Always had issues, went through counselling, just never resolved them and now live together cordially. They still share the same bed but MM says they no longer are intimate.

Fast forward to last week, I finally met with MM for the first time. He flew in for two days to spend some time with me while wife and kids were out of town. We talked for hours and of course, were intimate.. for hours. Not sure if it's completely relevant but there were times during our intimacy that he was unable to stay completely hard. He wouldn't ever go limp or stop pleasuring me but we had some difficulties downstairs. When the difficulties were resolved he finished almost immediately.

Now, things feel a little weird between us. When I bring it up, he says nothing has changed. He says he misses me a lot and can't wait til he gets the chance to see me again. I'm not sure if it's all in my head. He claims its the first time he's stepped out of his marriage but he has no regrets, and yet the energy is off. We still talk daily, though there hasn't been as many phone calls and the conversations fall a little bit flat.

I'm not sure what to do, how to approach him, or if I should just move on.

I need help because I'm not handling my emotions well and honestly am starting to feel like an obsessive ex girlfriend.

  
UPDATE: Since I attempted to post this last night, he's messaged me and said his feelings for me have grown stronger and he is anxious because he can feel me pulling away. This is my first experience with a MM so I'm not sure if I'm missing red flags or how to proceed with our relationship.

**Introduction**

As a broke college student, I dream of turning my ramen budget into a steak-and-lobster lifestyle. Achieving a 30% annual return on investments? Sounds like magic, but hey, Peter Lynch did it, and Warren Buffett’s not complaining. So, let’s unpack some strategies to supercharge long-term gains in the U.S. stock market—with a touch of student humor, of course.

# 1. Invest in High-Growth Tech Stocks

Tech stocks are like coffee for the stock market: they keep things buzzing. Think **NVIDIA, Tesla**, and **Apple**—companies that grow faster than my student loan interest rate.

[stock trends](https://preview.redd.it/xcnx0xpupx9e1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f2f693b5da5a278edf36ec477e886b5da81bd7)

* **Why it works**: These companies are at the forefront of innovation, dominating their sectors. NVIDIA, for example, delivered a **217% return over the last five years** (2020-2024).
* **Risk alert**: Volatility is high. One bad earnings report, and you’ll wish you invested in instant noodles instead.

# 2. Master the Art of Buy-and-Hold

""Time in the market beats timing the market."" If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in 2003 and held on, you’d be sitting on **$1.7 million** now.

* **Why it works**: Compounding is magical. Even **10% annual growth** turns $10,000 into $67,000 in 20 years. Imagine 30%.
* **Pro tip**: Patience is key. Diamond hands, folks.

# 3. Focus on Small-Cap Stocks

Small-cap companies are like underdog college startups—they have massive potential. Historically, small-caps have returned **12% annually**, outperforming large-caps.

* **Why it works**: They’re often overlooked, which means they’re undervalued.
* **Example**: Companies like **Cloudflare (NET)** and **Upstart (UPST)** have shown explosive growth.
* **Risk alert**: Some small caps crash harder than my GPA during finals.

# 4. Dive into Dividend Growth Stocks

Who doesn’t love free money? Dividend growth stocks like **Johnson & Johnson** or **Procter & Gamble** not only pay you but also grow in value.

* **Why it works**: Reinvested dividends can account for **40% of total stock returns** over time.
* **Pro tip**: Look for companies with a consistent **dividend growth rate of 8-10% annually**.

# 5. Leverage the Power of Index Funds

If stock-picking isn’t your thing, let the **S&P 500** do the heavy lifting.

* **Why it works**: Over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has averaged **\~10% annual returns**.
* **College hack**: Add a sprinkle of leverage (carefully!). Some ETFs, like **SPXL**, offer 3x exposure to the S&P 500. That’s 30% returns if the market rises 10%.
* **Risk alert**: Leverage is a double-edged sword. A 10% drop = a 30% loss. Yikes.

# 6. Explore Emerging Markets

While U.S. markets are great, emerging markets like **India** and **Vietnam** are growing faster than my caffeine consumption during finals week.

* **Why it works**: Higher economic growth = higher company profits.
* **Example**: ETFs like **VWO** or **EEM** give you exposure to these markets.
* **Risk alert**: Currency fluctuations and political instability can ruin the party.

# 7. Ride the Wave of Megatrends

Investing in megatrends is like being the first to show up at a dorm party—you get the best spot.

* **Current megatrends**: AI, green energy, electric vehicles, and the metaverse.
* **Example stocks**: **Tesla, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Unity Software (U)**.
* **Why it works**: These trends are reshaping industries, offering multi-decade growth potential.

# 8. Learn Options Trading (Carefully!)

Options are like Red Bull for your portfolio—lots of energy, but also potential crashes.

* **Why it works**: Leveraging options like covered calls or LEAPS can amplify gains.
* **Pro tip**: Start with strategies like selling puts or buying calls on stocks you already like.
* **Risk alert**: This strategy isn’t for the faint-hearted. Know your Greeks (Delta, Theta, Gamma) or prepare for a financial hangover.

[Stock Men](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockmen) **Conclusion**

Achieving 30% annual returns is no walk in the park—more like a sprint through finals week while dodging late-night pizza cravings. But with a mix of high-growth stocks, long-term patience, and strategic diversification, it’s not impossible. Just remember, the market is unpredictable, so keep some humor and humility handy.

ich habe seit ca. 2-3 Jahren diese Pads hier rumliegen und frage mich ob die noch gut sind. Auf den Dingern steht kein MHD und die Verpackung habe ich auch nicht mehr.

Da waren noch welche bei, die man vor dem einsetzen schütteln muss. Da da flüssige Milch drin ist, kommen die definitiv weg.
Bei denen, die auf dem Foto zu sehen sind bin ich mir nicht sicher.

Die Pads haben sich angesammelt, da ich keinen Kaffee regelmäßig trinke und mich die Maschine in ihrer Anwesenheit gestört hat. Dann ist alles in Vergessenheit geraten :D

I'm visiting Krakow from Canada on May 2025. One of our itinerary is to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. We are bringing our 1-year old child with us and I would like to ask for any recommendation/advices on the following:

  
a. I'm confused in getting a reservation for Auschwitz-Birkenau. It's indicated in [https://www.auschwitz.org/en/visiting/](https://www.auschwitz.org/en/visiting/) that the admission is free of charge but I have to make a reservation for the ""entry card"". I understand that the ""entry card"" reservation is for the guided tour but do we need to make a reservation if we opt for the ""unguided tour"" since the admission is already free? We don't mind paying for a guided tour.

b. In the website, it's indicated that ""Visits to the Museum by children under the age of 14 are not recommended."" and since we are bringing our 1 year-old child, we are planning to split our tour where my wife will start first in the morning (8:30) and I'll take the afternoon (12:30) assuming we can finish by 3.5 hours. Is there a walking distance coffee shop/restaurant that we can use while I or my wife wait? Any activities that I can do or visit while I wait for my wife?

c. We are staying in Old Town Krakow and this is the only practical transportation option going to Auschwitz-Birkenau that I found [https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/110994-auschwitz-birkenau-round-trip-bus-transfer-from-krakow/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult\_LIST&clickId=2adb3f7fc6](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/110994-auschwitz-birkenau-round-trip-bus-transfer-from-krakow/?spm=SearchResult.SearchResult_LIST&clickId=2adb3f7fc6) , is there any other options? Tour Package is not good for us since we need to take the tour individually and time constraint.

I know it’s not really that serious, but it’s still kinda upsetting to see. I got him a hot sauce sampler. He’s always buying different hot sauces to try out, so I figured it’d be a nice gift for him. Wrong. His face immediately scrunched up in disgust, saying that he wasn’t gonna try any of them. In other words, he thought all the flavors were gross. He didn’t even pretend to like it. Just a straight-up “I’m not even gonna try it”. It honestly did hurt to hear that, as I was excited to give it to him, thinking it’d be something he actually liked. That, along with all his other gifts, have been sitting on the coffee table since Christmas. He hasn’t touched a single one, not even to bring it to his room or put anything away. 

It’s pretty much like this every Christmas, birthday, and father’s day. He never seems to like anything we get him. My mom once got him both a hand massager and a really nice, high-end foot and leg massager, because he gets cramps quite often. We ended up just returning the hand massager because he “didn’t like it”, and he hasn’t touched the foot massager once. Maybe my mom and I are just really bad gift givers, I don’t know. But it still hurts to see just how obviously he dislikes or doesn’t care about nearly everything we get him. ",5,1735542059.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

A common pattern noted across all the Goa, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala, Andaman & Nicobar etc., tourist places is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a conference room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Le Meridian, Radisson, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with these membership offering fraud organizations, but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of most of their affiliated/partner properties are below 3/4-stars.

There is an annual fee on top of the membership fee and the exchange fee if you want to stay in any other properties apart from the listed ones on their portal. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation is incorrect.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be able to utilize it.",2,1735542041.0,u_Substantial_Sky_4927,0,1.0,False
1hphi43,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1hphi43/iddelete_ko_na_hindi_ko_na_gagamitin/,Iddelete ko na hindi ko na gagamitin. ,"Problem/Goal: Hi everyone. This is my first time to post here.
Long post ahead so please bear with me. I (F
20) was asked by my partner (M 23) to unfollow those guys that I am following sa instagram and I said d-delete ko na, hindi ko na gagamitin hindi na ako mag instagram and, he was so mad to the point na dinadabog yung wall and kahit anong mahawakan niya.

Context: Backstory: During early stage ng relationship namin, super okay kami and naging open na ako agad sa mga gusto at hindi ko gusto sa relationship para aware siva as well as with the traumas I had before and vice versa. He came from a 6 year relationship while 1 year and 10 months ako. So siya since HighSchool up to college yung long term partner niva at yung reason ng break up nila? I don't really know. Sabi niva lang na ayaw na niya. Yung saakin naman e because of cheating na ginawa saakin ng ex ko and I just decided na ayoko na ituloy yung saamin dabil sa mga trauma na nadulot saakin.. Going back, since galing siya sa long term relationship and for us to start fresh. asked him to cut all the ties na meron siva sa ex niva and i would do the same. We both agreed and noong una i thought ginawa niva.
Hanggang sa 2 months na kami at naka receive pa ako ng text message sa ex niva na winawarn ako about him. During those time, hindi na sila nag yusap (afaik) kasi every time na
Chinecheck ko e naka block siya sa ex niva and walang new convo. I told him about it and he just said told me to not mind it. As time goes by, sivempre may mga times na nattrigger ako and overthink lalo na at nag cheat saakin multiple times yung sa ex ko. So I asked him to unfollow those girls na puro thirst trap sa ig niva at sa facebook kasi kapag nakikita ko feed niva sunod sunod sa myday puro kita mga cleavage at thirst trap. He told me every reason that he could think of. That she was an old friend, ka churchmate before, kesyo andon na raw yun even before niva pa ako makilala, at least daw hindi naman na kinakausap matagal na or she's a friend of a friend, a family member of a friend, artista naman at ang iconic line na ""iddelete ko nalang instagram ko, hindi na ako mag iig kahit kailan"" card. llang beses namin pinag talunan yung about doon.
Kaysa i-unfollow niva, dinelete niva nalang ig niya. Kainis diba? Like hindi ko naman siya pinag bawalan mag fb or ig. Ang sinabi ko lang naman ay i-unfollow yung mga yun kasi meron nang ako. Hanggang sa ako yung nababaliktad to the point na ako pa nag ssound demanding

at toxic just because of it, kapalit ng peace of mind ko hindi pa magawa. Kaya Hanggang sa naniwala na lang ako na hindi na siya nag jinstagram pero may mga times na may kutob ako pero wala akong proof. I always had that gut feeling pero dahil nga sa wala naman akong proof at ako pa ang mag mumukhang paranoid at toxic. I brushed it off. Cinocomfort ko nalang sarili ko na baka wala naman kasi talaga at oa lang ako. Fast forward October this year, kung kallan bumabalik na tiwala ko sakaniya and umookay na kami.. Doon naman ako minessage ng ex niya asking if kami pa ba. lasked her why and she proceeds on sending me screenshots of his conversation with his ex's ate sa instagram. Nakikipag catch up, update and nagyayaya makipag coffee date.
Sinabi niya pa na wag mahibiyang mag sabi sakaniva kapag may need siya. Na kinagalit ko kasi, first is yung more than a year niya ako pinag sinungalingan na hindi na siya nag linstagram, turns out na kapag wala ake doon siya nag linstall or kung tulog ako. Second, nag uupdate siya tapos may vid pa ng motor niya.
Tapos magyayaya coffee date e samantalang ako hindi niva niyaya ni isang beses kasi hindi naman din siya mahilig mag kape? At ako ang gumagastos madalas pati pang gas niya kasi wala siyang pera. I know.. (working student kasi siya at siya sagot lahat sa sarili niya).
Meron din isa lang convo na sinend ex niya na nagchat sakaniya kasi akala sila pa, nag sumbong kasi tong partner ko nag rreply sa myday ng girlfriend nong guy. Nakakahiya.
Masakit sa part ko na ilang beses ko siya tinanong and i thought I made it clear na wala na dapat usap kahit pa sa family ng ex.. He begged and I accepted it. Pero hindi doon nag tapos, turns out, simula palang yun ng mga tinatago niya saakin.. December this year noong nag ka chance akong makausap mama niya ng kaming dalawa lang talaga kasi busy sa work and hindi ako palagi sakanila. Habang nag kkwentuhan kami, sinabi ko yung about sa ex niya, and ang sabi saakin ng mother niya, pumunta pala partner ko sa ex niya last year. Nag paalam kasi makikramay. Wala naman idea mother niya na hindi ko alam so hinayaan niya raw since kahit papano eh naka meet niya rin yun. Backstory: noong october nagkataon din na nag chat bigla saakin ex ko and he spilled na pumunta raw tong partner ko sa ex niya, again. Hindi ako aware. (I can make a separate part of this). 

Turns out, lahat ng mga nararamdaman ko ever since ay totoo. Nakaka disappoint and nakakagalit dahil sa pagiging sinungaling niya at kasama ko siya sa halos araw araw at never ko pinag higpitan pero magagawa niya pa rin yun. We are still trying. Bumabawi naman siya pero up until now hindi pa rin nag hheal yung sugat ng betrayal na ginawa niya. Wala pa ‘to sa mga iba pa naming away. So kanina I noticed na naka seen yung mga unread messages ko sa ig at fb. I asked him if inopen niya ba phone ko and he said yes. Then he proceeds with asking me about who’s this guy, kaano ano mo ‘to yada yada and gusto niya iunfriend ko sa facebook yung kaybigan ko na lalaki because he asked me kung may tg ako because ayun daw yung gamit niya pang chat sa friends and families. I simply answered no and wala naman na siyang angal. Then Napunta naman siya sa ig. Pinapa unfollow lahat ng lalaki. Mind you guys, never kami nag ka issue sa side ko about deleting conversations, flirt or cheating. May following akong mga lalaki but they are not my failed talking stages. They are my friends and classmates lang talaga kahit conversations about sa school lang and kapag maglalaro. So when he asked me “wala ka manlang gagawin sa relasyon natin?” I told him na wala naman akong maling ginagawa una palang. Siya ang meron at alam niya sa sarili niya yun. Binalik ko lang sakaniya yung iddelete ko na ig ko at hindi ko na gagamitin kahit kailan card. More than a year akong nag beg sakaniya about doon noon pero netong october niya lang ginawa tapos saakin, ako na Walang ginagawa o tinatago gusto niya gawin ko agad. I-unfollow ko agad? Ganon ganon nalang? He was so mad. Dinuro pa ako, sinisigawan at tinatakot na hindi na siya sasama saamin sa new year at pinapa uwi ako. (sakanila kasi muna kami mag sasalubong then saamin next). 

Any advice will be appreciated. Should I just go home? Or Should I just unfollow those people?

Ps. sorry kung may mga typo or magulo sa pagkwento. This is my first time to post about this huhu.

i was working in the drive through, handing out people's food at the window and wishing them a good day. we get an iced coffee on order, and my manager instructs me to make it. everything was going well, i was prepping the espresso shot, filled the cup with ice and the right kind of milk. it was only when i needed to add the sugar and caramel syrup that everything went down hill. 

there was a fat fly resting on the nozzle of the sugar syrup bottle. i noticed too late. i slammed the nozzle down and this massive fly got rocketed into the cup full of ice and milk. for a solid 10 seconds i stood there is shock, watching this fly struggle to stay afloat. after the shock wore off, the only choice i had was to simply grab the fly out of the drink so the coffee could get out in time. 

i felt it squirm in my fingers after i grabbed it. it was repulsive, but i quickly added the rest of the syrup and the espresso shot to hand it out. the lady i gave it to was lovely, which has only made me feel worse. in a moment of weakness i told my manager, who didn't care as long as i wasn't serving coffee that actively had flies in it. 

the memory has haunted me. i've worked at mcdonald's a long time and also do farm work at school and have volunteered at a zoo for two years, but this is still the most disgusting thing i can think of to ever happen at any of these. i can't get the image of the fly swimming in the milk out of my head. i feel so bad for the woman who unknowingly drank fly tainted coffee.

I, 27F, don’t have very many friends. For years I’ve felt like an outcast whenever I try to make new friends. I came from a very small, rural elementary school so I was always with the same people for the first 9 years of school(I’m talking like there were 15-20 kids in each grade level, my 8th grade class was like 12 kids). As I reached high school, it was a big change for me and I struggled since a lot of the kids I went to school with beforehand either found their own new friends or went to a different high school. I ate lunch alone outside and sometimes in classrooms. I even had my math teacher question why I always sit alone and where are my friends. It wasn’t until halfway through sophomore year that I had found a few friends to eat lunch with. And then it wasn’t until junior year that we became a somewhat solid friend group, and we graduated high school together. I picked up a few other friends along the way by meeting friends of my friends. Then college came and my two main friends went to other colleges and even though I reached out multiple times, the friendship pretty much dwindled down to us simply being acquaintances. I had two other high school friends that I went to college with and now they are technically the ones that I still keep in touch with. But one of them moved across the country with a new job and is enjoying their new life and new friends. That leaves me with one friend left in my area. However, the friendship is difficult to maintain and is frustrating. They never reach out first, so I was always the one to initiate messaging or Snapchats. For the past year, I have decided to minimize my efforts in being the initiator and it seems like I am an afterthought after all as I suspected. This individual will make plans with me (after I initiate, of course) and then bail last minute, so now I know to never get my hopes up. It’s every excuse in the book that comes up, yet I see them hanging out with their other friends multiple times. Like we will make plans to get coffee together (most of the time it’s their idea), and they bail. Then I see the next day they are traveling with their other friend to a place that is like 2 or 3 hours away. Then the cycle repeats. It’s so often that it’s comedic honestly. It’s really putting a damper on my self-esteem and I wonder why we are friends at all. And I know that I should just go out and make new friends somehow, but I have terrible social anxiety and there isn’t much to do in my area for socializing anyway. I would have to go to the next town over. So now I’m just trying to weigh my options. I just feel left out of things and I feel like I’m missing out on my life as a 27 year old.

1hph9f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Threads1984/comments/1hph9f9/uk_economic_prospects_1997/,UK economic prospects : 1997,"What would be the state of the UK in 1997, 13 years after the nuclear strike ? The movie didn’t translate the state of the UK through economic figures, so I decided to give it a try. To write this, I used several reports from 1983 about the UK, historical data related to medieval Britain and reports on similar disasters.

Here are the key figures and major outputs of the UK in 1983 : 
* 56 million people
* 223 people per square kilometers
* Major cities (political and economic centers) : Greater London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester
* 23 million working people as follows : 0,6 in agriculture, 8 in industry, 14 in other activities
* 33 million non-working people : newborn, elderly, children, students, jobless…
* GDP : 489 billion $
* Industry % of GDP : 18% or 88 billion $
* Agriculture % of GDP : 2% or 9 billion $
* Services % of GDP : 79% or 386 billion $  
* GDP per capita : 8700 $
* 22 million tonnes of cereal in 1983 (based on 1982 figures)
* 13 million cattles and calves in 1983
* 34 million sheeps and lambs in 1983
* 130 million poultries in 1983
* 119 million tonnes of coal in 1983, but by March 1984 the miners strike is ongoing and many coal stocks are already exhausted, despite the government having stockpiled 6 months of coal
* 2 million of barrels per day in 1983 (including NGL), to put in contrast with the fact that UK was probably consuming 1 to 1,5 million barrels per day in 1983

To estimate the economic figures of the UK in 1997, I use the following informations :
* Based on historical data depicting the consequences of the « Year without a summer » in 1816, we can safely states that the first harvest output following the nuclear strike drop is ranging from 50% to 85% due to the nuclear winter
* Even if the sun goes back the following years, available manpower has seriously diminished, the production is vulnerable to disease and there is probably no more fuel to use tractors and combined harvest, so the following harvest will only be a fraction of pre-war level
* Even if the livestock is not impacted by the lack of sunlight, it will be impacted by the nuclear radiation, we can estimate that same percentage for humans applies to livestock : 50% died in the year following the nuclear strike, and many more later due to lack of food diverted to feed the human survivors, care and because there survival depends on an industrial agriculture; and also because desperate people will probably prey on the livestock (dead or alive) like Ruth and Bob in the movie, further destroying what remains of it. The fact that the agricultural scenes in Threads set 10 and 13 years after the nuclear strike show no animals, except for the rabbit captured by Jane, allow for the assumption that the livestock of UK is nearly extinct or seriously diminished
* Due to the scale of the destruction, we can safely assume that the industry (as it was in UK before the war) has definitively ceased to exist, being replaced by run down factories like the one where Jane is seen collecting yarn from old fabrics
* The service industry has probably also disappeared as many trades from the past are not anymore relevant to the world following the collapse of the UK (leisure, hospitals, university, cinema, grocery store, coffee, pubs, supermarket and so on…), even if some sort of communal services exist like rudimentary schools, makeshift hospitals and food depots
* UK don't participate anymore in international trade
* Nothing is said about the North Sea oil fields, but it could be safe to assume that they are not functioning anymore or are difficult to reach
* UK has probably resorted to extract coal and use it with steam machine to produce limited electricity locally as depicted near the end of the movie, but without machinery and a diminished miners workforce the production will be far from pre-war level
* UK is probably inhabited by something like 8 million people as stated in the movie

So, here are the key economic figures and major outputs of the UK in 1997 refined with the help of ChatGPT. Note that these figures can’t really translate the fact that the economy will be a barter economy, as it’s difficult to capture non-monetary transactions in term of economic figures : 
* 8 million people
* 33 people per square kilometers
* No more major cities, but possible minor hub of population relying on precarious and local electric grid powered by coal if pit or pre-war stock available nearby, meaning that the local population could have salvage some pre-war technologies
* 6 million or more working people (including children) as follows : 4.5-5 in agriculture, 1-1.5 in other activities (mining, communal services, run-down factories, scavenging…). Note that it’s plausible for people in 1997 to work in a more “circular” fashion, implying that they switch from activities depending on emergencies or season for example
* 2 million or less non-working people : newborn, elderly, disabled and sick people, could also include potential wandering groups or individuals across the UK who are totally disconnected from surviving communities. These groups could be either hostile (like raiders) or neutral
* GDP: 1.6 billion $
* Agriculture: 70% or 1.12 billion $ 
* Run-down communal services, industry, and scavenging: 30% or $0.48 billion $ 
* GDP per capita: 200 $ 
* 2-3 million tonnes of cereal, an amount that can matches medieval Britain data on agriculture
* 0.5-1 million or less heads for what remains of the pre-war livestock, an amount fewer than what we know of medieval Britain but aligned with what I said earlier regarding the possible decimation of the livestock following the collapse of UK and the need for humans to feed themselves before the livestock
* 0.5-1 million tonnes of coal
* No fuel or only negligible remaining pre-war stock

A note on international trade and Northern Ireland : 
* If international trade has ceased for the UK, negligible exchanges are possible between what remains of Northern Ireland and mainland UK with the use of salvage boats. Some contacts could also have been established between Douvres and Calais with negligible people crossing the Channel, even if it’s unlikely due to the number of bombs that fall on the southern part of England, probably leaving it deserted. 
* Even though we speak here of the UK, the idea of an united country has vanished with the collapse of centralized governance and modern society. Knowing that Northern Ireland in 1984 was engulfed in a deadly civil war, we can guess that the collapse of order, communication with mainland UK and governance could have been worsened by the fights between armed factions in Northern Ireland.

He wants me to be his girlfriend but doesn’t communicate—does he even like me?

This guy (m/22) and I (f/22) have been friends for 3 years. I used to have feelings for him early on, but they weren’t reciprocated, so I moved on. Still, I’ve always had a soft spot for him. A few months ago, we kissed at a bar, and things progressed into us hooking up. I thought it was just a FWB situation until he said, “What do you think about working towards being in a relationship?”

Long story short, we live in different places, and right before winter break (a month apart, since we’re still in college), he asked me to be his girlfriend in bed—and he hadn’t even taken me on a date yet. I said no, partly because I wasn’t sure how I felt, and partly because I needed more effort from him.

Here’s the thing: he’s super sweet and affectionate in person. He tells me how much he likes me, calls me beautiful, smart, kind, and caring, etc. But when it comes to communication or effort, I feel like I’m carrying the relationship. I’m the one texting him, asking questions, sending him things that remind me of him, or even buying him coffees. I’m ready to give this my all because I feel like I have a lot of love to give—but he’s giving me almost nothing in return.

Over break, he doesn’t text unless I text him first. I’ve brought this up, and he says he’s just a “bad texter,” but he also doesn’t call me either. I can understand bad texting if we were seeing each other regularly, but when we’re apart for a month, shouldn’t I at least be on his mind?

I really want this to work because I’d like to explore what we could have together, but I’m starting to feel drained. I’m wondering if he just doesn’t like me enough, or if there’s a logical reason for him being like this. I love having conversations and I intend on just saying all of this to him on call soon, but when I keep asking at some point it starts to feel like I’m being needy / him then ‘fixing’ the problem is almost as if he’s doing me a favour / as an obligation and I hate that so much 

How should I approach this?

I (23F) work as a psych care worker at my local hospital, which is apart of a larger chain of hospitals in my county. I've been there for a couple months now, and have mostly enjoyed the job, mainly because it pays well. Surprisingly, the patients are the easy part. It's the lazy staff, the lack of communication from others, and the long hours (sometimes without even a bathroom break) that can make the job dreadful. I've put up with it since the good parts of the job make it worthwhile, but this came to a head a couple weeks ago.

This may make me sound like an idiot lol, but I hadn't realized that healthcare is essentially a corporation. After the assassination of the health insurance CEO (free my man luigi), and a coincidental rewatch of *Office Space* (such a good movie), I began to put two and two together. Despite everything I was doing to help my assigned patient each shift, it didn't make enough of a difference. Every patient I saw was still cycling through the same experience: not being given the amount of care they deserved, then being charged an exorbitant amount of money they didn't have.

This is when my plan began to form. About once a month, there aren't many psych patients in our unit, so I get assigned to assist on menial tasks in a different unit. Here's the kicker: this is not apart of my actual job, and the hospital doesn't keep track of this type of change. The hospital would never know if I actually went to a different unit to assist. So, when they told me there was no patient assigned to me this shift and to go to a different unit to assist, I just didn't do it. I punched into my shift as usual, then went to get a coffee. I stayed in the hospital while I was on the clock, but didn't actually work. I'm night shift, so there wasn't much to do, so I ended up just listening to *brat* in the bathroom lol.

On nights when I am assigned a patient, I don't engage in any quiet quitting type activities. I'm still attentive, and keep up with taking care of the patient, which I still enjoy doing. But it has now happened twice where I am not assigned a patient and just kinda bullshit around for my shift.

When I told my friends (23F, 22F) about this, they didn't disagree with my quiet quitting my job (they know how much stress my coworkers have caused me), but they didn't understand the method that I had taken. They know I have self-destructive patterns of behavior, and worry that I'll be reprimanded or fired because of my behavior. They didn't tell me to stop, but that I should consider a different method. I dismissed their worries, and they didn't want to continue talking about it, which I feel bad about now. Their opinions have kinda seeped into my head, and now I don't know what to do.

I have had sexual encounters before but i've never actually stayed the night with a guy before and i've only ever had two brief coffee dates in the last year ( not with this guy) so the whole dating scene as well as sleep over scene is completely new to me! i’m freaking out 🥲

We haven't really gone over a lot of the fine details yet, but he mentioned he would like to spend 3 nights in a little cottage ( a place that i’m familiar with, i've stayed there twice on my own and he loves the look of the serenity so much he would love to spend time together there)
I’m all ok with that.

1hpgxvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockmen/comments/1hpgxvz/tesla_stock_price_prediction_2025/,Tesla Stock Price Prediction 2025,"Hey there, folks! Let's dive into the crystal ball and take a humorous yet data-driven look at Tesla's (TSLA) stock forecast for 2025. Buckle up, because this ride is going to be as thrilling as a Tesla on autopilot (without the nap, of course)!

First off, Tesla's stock has been a rollercoaster of emotions for investors, skyrocketing from 30*in*2013*toover*200 in 2014 – a whopping 800% increase in just a year! Now, that's what we call electric performance. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; let's focus on 2025.

[TESLA CEO](https://preview.redd.it/lnren35cix9e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=930ea5e07847c413363d06ea850b8479ac5a5a6b)

According to various analysts, Tesla's stock price could be anywhere between 625*and*650 by the end of 2025. Some even dream bigger, like one bold prediction suggesting it could hit $1,000 per share! Imagine telling your grandchildren, ""I told you so"" when they ask about that investment decision.

Now, let's break down these forecasts with some juicy data:

1. **Production and Expansion**: Tesla's ongoing production hikes and expansions at its Texas, Shanghai, and Berlin factories are hinting at some serious growth. The gradual ramp-up of Model Y production in Texas and progress on 4680 battery manufacturing show Tesla's commitment to tech advancements and cost efficiency. By 2025, these efforts should translate into higher revenues and, hopefully, happier shareholders.
2. **Competition and Market Share**: While traditional automakers like Ford and GM are gearing up to launch their EVs, Tesla isn't sitting idle. It's aiming for a 20-30% sales growth in 2025, which might seem modest compared to previous expectations, but remember, this is on top of its already substantial sales base. Plus, with the rumored launch of a new Model 3 hatchback, Tesla's total addressable market (TAM) could expand into the global compact car segment, grabbing a 12-15% share. Now, that's what we call electric ambition!
3. **Autonomous Driving and AI**: The real magic lies in Tesla's autonomous driving capabilities. By 2025, its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is expected to hit a major inflection point, akin to the ""ChatGPT moment"" in AI. Some early adopters have already received the V13.2 update, which is like giving your Tesla rocket fuel – it can now start FSD directly from a parking lot without pre-setting navigation! Imagine the possibilities – from robot taxis to your Tesla driving you to work while you sip your morning coffee (hopefully, without spilling it).
4. **Market Sentiment and Valuation**: Currently, Tesla trades at a forward P/E ratio of 122 times for 2025, which is lower than its peak of 145 times in 2021. Despite the valuation, Wall Street remains divided. Some analysts, like Gary Black from The Future Fund LLC, predict that Tesla's stock could surpass its all-time high of $410, driven by new product launches and expanding markets. On the other hand, more cautious voices remind us of the intense competition and potential demand slowdown.
5. **Regulatory Tailwinds**: Let's not forget the policy environment. Governments around the world are pushing for greener energy solutions, which bodes well for Tesla. Whether it's subsidies, tax incentives, or infrastructure buildouts, these tailwinds could help Tesla soar even higher.

[TESLA stock price 1 year](https://preview.redd.it/boonuwomix9e1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=7044ee625169d6c590ac41f184efe608ffbbd253)

In conclusion, Tesla's stock forecast for 2025 is as unpredictable as a Tesla on Autopilot navigating a busy highway (but hopefully without any accidents). While some predict a smooth ride to 650,*others dream of a moonshot to* 1,000. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: Tesla's journey is as exciting as ever, filled with innovation, competition, and a whole lot of electric buzz!

Remember, investing is like riding a Tesla – it's thrilling, but always buckle up and keep your eyes on the road (or, in this case, the stock market). Happy investing, folks!",1,1735539736.0,stockmen,0,1.0,False

I currently own a v3 and after a rough year I'm considering a new coffee brewer, though I would like to be more conscious on my spending habits.  Would a v4 be a worthwhile upgrade due to its modular base design, or should I stick with the v3 and consider a different modular dripper ecosystem?

I currently use the v3 for my driver, with occasional deep 27 at night for decaf/small cups.

TIA.

Edit: should probably mention I'm still considering narrow vs. wide.  Not sure what the difference is between the two.

It was a brownish pink nude lip gloss from the early 2000s (but as late as 2006?) and had gold shimmer in it. If I recall, the cap was an iridescent white color and the tube was straight. I think it was bonne bell brand or a related brand, but not sure. Definitely something available at a drug store. Help!",1,1735539401.0,HelpMeFind,3,1.0,False
