I need to work 20 hours a week in order to pay my bills but there‚Äôs been a serious lack of hours. I don‚Äôt want to totally quit because I work from home, it pays pretty good and it‚Äôs flexible and is a good fit for me. However with the lack of hours I need to find a second job 

This happened last year and I got a 2nd job at coffee chain but that only lasted about 2 months. It was very stressful. I was given almost no training and training was inconsistent among different people. I was overwhelmed and it didn‚Äôt end well. 

I need a way to bring in that extra money. What part time jobs do you have experience with that will be less likely to lead to burnout? I don‚Äôt think a customer facing role is for me. I‚Äôm hoping to be able to work weekends. 

I also thought about possibly reopening my Etsy shop. It never brought in a lot of money and it was also stressful in its own way having to deal with social media, product listings; creating my new product, shipping things and going to post office multiple times a week. I would want to turn some of my designs into embroidery on shirts and sweatshirts but an embroidery machine is a very large upfront cost and idk if it would be worth it overall

Any tips or words of encouragement would be helpful, thank you

**Background**
I have a family history of heart disease, high BP, & high cholesterol. I was hoping to not need meds yet, but here we are. 

My BP has been erratic for the last few years. Very high when I'm sick (165/106 with RSV), but normal (110/80) when I'm not. It has slowly been increasing. I would sometimes get tremendously different readings within 10 minutes (185/114-130/90).  I have lifelong asthma that is controlled with maintenance medication but is aggravated when I get sick, often requiring nebulizer/albuterol use. 
. 

**Currently**
I just started taking amlodipine besylate, 5 mg once per day last week. I already feel much better (didn't realize I felt bad until I felt better).  I take my blood pressure 2x/day (AM & PM).  My blood pressure seems to be slowly lowering & stabilizing (177/133 & 148/113 on day 3 of meds, 146/100 & 131/90 on day 6 of meds).  

I understand that the medication works to prevent calcium from entering my veins to relax & soften them, which allows greater blood flow.  I understand that due to its half-life, it will take about 7 days for the medication to be at full load in my body, which is about a steady 12 mg.      I also know that it takes about 1 month for the medicine‚Äôs full effects & have a follow-up appointment with my doctor. 

My husband & I cook at home 90% of the time. We prefer to make things ourselves & avoid pre-packaged items as much as possible. We do not cook with salt or salt items (garlic powder vs garlic salt). We prefer fresh vegetables but keep frozen corn, string beans, & peppers on hand. We will even buy fresh vegetables & cut them up & freeze them ourselves. When using canned (last choice) we buy ‚Äúno salt added‚Äù when available. Almost all cooked meals contain fresh onion & garlic, plus a side vegetable (sometimes two). We do not fry anything.  When we eat ground beef it is always drained. 

I intermittent fast (generally 18:6).  I have lost 37 pounds over the last 2 years & have gone from obese to overweight. I am continuing to slowly lose weight. I have 1-2 cups of black coffee without sweetener per day & then drink water (about 70-80 oz per day) 99% of the time. I occasionally have herbal tea without sweetener or a hot toddy (1 oz bourbon, 1 tbs honey, 1 tbsp lemon juice, a cinnamon stick, & an anise star) about once every week or two. 

I am a teacher & on my feet pretty consistently from 8AM to 5PM. My commute is about 1.5 hours each way. 

**Questions**
1.  What is a reasonable expectation of how low my blood pressure will get?
2. Should I expect to see my blood pressure continue to lower after the first week?
3.  About when should I expect to see ‚Äúthis is as low as it's going to get with this dose?‚Äù",1,1736092916.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

","My (42F) husband (43M) and I are in the final stages of our divorce. We're still living together and, honestly, our day-to-day life hasn‚Äôt changed much since we made the decision. We‚Äôve always had a good relationship, and the divorce was entirely my choice because I don‚Äôt want kids, while he does. I didn‚Äôt want to hold him back from having the life he envisions or live with the guilt of not giving him what he wants. After a lot of processing, I felt it was better to part ways amicably before resentment could take root. It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but it felt necessary.

For New Year‚Äôs Eve, we celebrated separately for the first time in our 14 years together. I even encouraged him to go out with friends or find a party since he didn‚Äôt have plans. He ended up going to a singles party, and he assured me it wasn‚Äôt about meeting someone new ‚Äì he said it‚Äôs far too soon for him to think about dating.

But‚Ä¶ he did meet someone. They exchanged numbers at the party, and since then, they‚Äôve gone for coffee a couple of times. Today, he told me he‚Äôs going to her place for dinner and plans to stay over until tomorrow.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm struggling. At first, I thought I‚Äôd be okay with this. I truly want him to be happy, and I knew this was part of what divorce would eventually mean. But now, the more I think about it, the more I feel deeply hurt. I didn‚Äôt expect him to start connecting with someone else this soon, especially while we‚Äôre still living under the same roof. It feels disrespectful, even though I know we‚Äôre technically no longer together.

I‚Äôm conflicted because I pride myself on being reasonable, and I don‚Äôt want to come across as controlling or hypocritical. He has no interest in knowing if I ever start dating, but I told him I‚Äôd like to know if he does. Now that he‚Äôs met someone, it feels like a gut punch.

Am I overreacting for feeling this way? I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone I know about this because I‚Äôm worried they won‚Äôt understand, so I‚Äôm turning to Reddit for advice.

*His legend was based upon the 1991 murder of a little girl named Heather Dawn Church. When everything pointed to the family as the killers of their child, Lou refused to give up, complaining that the police would not look elsewhere for a suspect.* ***Smit matched an overlooked print on a screen that led to the real killer and emerged an absolute hero.***

*Soon after Smit was hired we went out for a cup of coffee, and he told me one of his personal commandments: ‚ÄúMurders are usually what they seem. Rarely are they perfectly planned,‚Äù he said. He was cautious and noncommittal, which I considered prudent,* ***since he had not yet had a chance to read the thousands of pages in the file****. He spoke at length about Heather Dawn Church, as if the murder of that little girl might be the blueprint for this case too.*

*Three days later at a detective briefing, Smit made his first appearance, greeting us all and taking a seat along the west wall. We went around the table to update our findings. Finally it was his turn.* ***He had been around only about seventy-two hours, not anywhere near long enough to devour the case material,*** *but we hoped he might have some initial insights. He did. Lou shifted the toothpick to a corner of his mouth, and his eyes twinkled with the excitement of a good bird dog on point. He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was the Ramseys.‚Äù He never budged from that position.*

I didn't know about Smit's other case until I read this book. What do you all think? Could he have been influenced from the start?

Yesterday, blood pressure rose to 160 yesterday night, triggered by a really bad quarell with a family member, causing really bad headache surrounding the back of her head. Headache was so unbearable, she started crying. 

Doctor only administered her with Paracetamol (2 tabs x 3 daily) at the family clinic. 

However, this morning we realised that after drinking coffee, the headache returned, along with shortness of breath and crying. Paracetamol helped soothe the pain, and she managed to get some rest. 

Throughout the day, she ate porridge with some red meat, drank hibiscus tea, blend of celery, beet, coconut water and banana. 

The headache and shortness of breath suddenly came back after she experienced a gagging feeling when cleaning her tongue. 

Beyond the episodes of bad headache, she is able to move around physically, talk and laugh.

For about 2 months I was living under a rock , happy that I was brewing a good cup and having really great coffee... oblivious to everything else.. 

I thought I was doing great! The shots were good  and I couldn't really get the stress on getting a good grinder and using fresh beans.. I knew it would make a difference but couldn't really understand how much!

But then the other fellow picopresso posts were making me anxious. I wasn't getting crema but I had attributed that to the pre ground beans and made peace with it... then I read about people jamming their pumps, equipment being too hot to handle, the arm workout because of pumping and on and on and I started getting fomo!!

That's when I took the plunge and got myself the K6 and dialed in my first shot!!! OMG was I blown or what... 

The shot was full bodied, syrupy and oh! the flavours. 

I finally feel I am utilizing the full potential of my equipments and the money was well spent. 

I am still learning and have a long way to go but the real fun has just begun for me. 

My family thinks it's too much taam jhaam for one cup of coffee but after I made my husband a cup today, he was impressed :)

It makes a world of a difference so really if you want to get the best out of your equipment and the money and time and efforts, get a good compatible grinder to go!!!

1hu9mct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1hu9mct/ken_korczak/,KEN KORCZAK,"This is a true mind-bending story of a Minnesota man who piloted a UFO across space- time.

So, I noticed that the Dean of Ufology, Grant Cameron, has been focusing for some time on a rare and peculiar aspect of the UFO experience.

It is abductees, contactees‚Äô and/or sundry experiencers who report that ‚ÄúThe Others‚Äù sometimes encourage or even insist that people try their hand at piloting a UFO. In all cases, this is accomplished by the melding of the mind of the person with the consciousness of the UFO itself.

Cameron explores this phenomenon in-depth in his new book, UFO Sky Pilots. In it, he shares the reports of ten experiencers, folks from all occupations, who have been granted the extraordinary privilege of flying a UFO. As it turns out, the greater implications that fall out of this scenario are far more profound and wide-ranging than you might imagine.

Kvande relates his lifetime of UFO and alien interaction in his book, they are two long-time Minnesota MUFON top investigators, Bill McNeff, and Craig R. Lang. Both McNeff and Lang said they consider Roger Kvande among the most credible UFO experiencers they have interviewed out of hundreds investigated over many years. Prolific and bestselling British author Nick Redfern judged Kvande to be a ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù example of a UFO phenomenon experiencer.

I have also had some communication with Mr. Kvande as well. I can tell you that he is not fake. In fact, he has enjoyed a decades-long and successful career in the electronics-computer sector. Before he retired, he was the Senior Scientific Programmer at Unisys, IBM in Rochester, MN. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial electronics at Bemidji State University. His skills have been in much demand over the years. He has worked for many of the biggest names in the industry.

Grant Cameron notes in his book that, among all the UFO pilot [experiencers]() he has interviewed, most say they flew the craft only once.

In Kvande‚Äôs case, however, he has ‚Äúflown the ship‚Äù multiple times.

¬†He began piloting a UFO from the time he was a child and into adulthood. Indeed, he developed an intensely personal relationship with a UFO he came to call simply, ‚ÄúShip.‚Äù Kvande describes Ship as an A.I. with its own intelligence. In some respects, Ship is like Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù or Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiri,‚Äù except a million times wiser, more knowledgeable, and more powerful. Ship is ever ready to answer Kvande‚Äôs questions and offer advice. For example, as Kvande was flying over the super-flat plains of the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota-Dakota, he casually wondered why the landscape was so flat.

Ship read his mind and instantly flooded his consciousness with a geological history lesson dating back to the last Ice Age. It showed him how various earth forces acted over thousands of years to create the pool table terrain of northeast North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and southern Manitoba. But Kvande also said this downloaded history lesson quickly became overwhelming. The amount of information poured into his mind was voluminous to the point of disorientation.

In Cameron‚Äôs book, most of the UFO pilots report flights into space, to other planets or sometimes to points on planet Earth, but in Kvande‚Äôs case, Ship can take him not only to the far corners of the universe but backward and forward through time. Furthermore, Ship can assist Kvande in interacting with his past lives and future lives as in reincarnation-type scenarios. Ship is a source of predictive information as well, such as showing or warning Kvande of [possible future]() catastrophic events. In one instance, for example, Ship shows Kvande a future day in which a supernova is blazing menacingly in Earth‚Äôs sky.

¬†‚ÄúMY COMMUNICATION WITH MR. KVANDE‚Äù

After I published a book review of Extraterrestrial Odyssey in 2017, Roger Kvande reached out to me to thank me for my positive comments. We then further engaged in a short dialogue after that. He provided me with some additional fascinating information about Ship.

‚ÄúWhen I flew Ship, I was within the body of the beast being fed oxygen, food I was protected,‚Äù Kvande said. Ship was designed to find a newly forming solar system and then help planets develop their environments.

It assists in life cycles that produce planets that hold water and can nurture new life.

¬†‚ÄúWHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF IT?‚Äù

I realize that many who read this, even UFO proponents, will find their belief systems stressed to breaking point by Kvande‚Äôs story. What helps his case, however, is that many witnesses, without a doubt witnessed what was certainly a significant and spectacular UFO event that occurred in Bagley in April of 1966. At the time, the story received some national attention.

For example, the Bagley incident was reported in Flying Saucers, a Chicago-based magazine edited by the once-famous Raymond A. Palmer. A significant and influential figure in the field of science fiction, Palmer was the former long-time editor of the pulp science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.

Raymond Palmer also was a co-founder of FATE magazine, at one time the largest circulation paranormal-topic magazine of its kind in the world. FATE is still published today. Anyway, Ray Palmer placed this blurb in the March 1967 issue of Flying Saucers magazine (which he also created and edited):

April 22, 1966, Bagley (Minnesota) Several people were said to have observed an object fly at low altitude and land outside Bagley. Four dwarfs [seemed to make]() repairs, then the craft flew away.

(Note: Kvande said that there were four gray aliens with him inside the UFO during his flying adventures).

Still, many of you might be saying: ‚ÄúYou know, Ken, a blurb in a low-circulation UFO mag from the 1960s is not much to hang your hat on.‚Äù

Well, there is a lot more information to suggest that the 1966 Bagley UFO flyover really happened.

This, in addition to the considerable recorded public record notations and the embedded lore of the April 1966 UFO event in Bagley, Minnesota, make this one of the most interesting cases in ufology. I return now to Minnesota MUFON investigators Bill McNeff and Craig Lang. They report a conversation with a certain Art Sampsel of Bunker Hill, Indiana.

Mr. Sampsel said that a friend of his was in the tiny town of Goodridge, Minnesota, attending a farm sale. Goodridge is about fifty miles from Bagley. At the farm sale, Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend reports that he overheard two local farmers from Bagley discussing the April 1966 UFO storming of Main Street.

They described the event as Roger Kvande said it happened, including the fact that the school bus, nearly collided with it before landing ‚Äúon the outskirts of town.‚Äù The two Bagley farmers added that the ‚Äúentire town was in a panic.‚Äù Finally, I can tell you this, as a NW Minnesota resident, have traveled through and stopped for a time on many occasions in the town of Bagley over the years. My brother lives in the nearby city of Bemidji. On one trip, back in the 1990s, I stopped at a convenience store gas station that was also a bait shop and there I overheard a conversation by some local elderly guys spending time together and drinking coffee. They were discussing the very same story as presented by Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend at the Goodridge farm sale, and the details of the bait shop guys were identical.

This is my first trip to the UK and I have reasons for staying where I am that I won‚Äôt go into here. However, I would love some input as I‚Äôm reading a lot of differing opinions regarding day trips. I‚Äôm going in Feb so I imagine the weather won‚Äôt be fantastic for a lot of outdoor exploring. 

Day 1- arrive in London (hopefully on time) before 9 am. Grab a coffee and the nearest sausage roll and catch bus to Bristol. I imagine I will be exhausted after flying all night so I was planning just to check into my Airbnb(in Clifton) and sleep a bit. Get up early evening and find some place nearby to grab food and a nice pint.

Day 2 - Thursday- considering a day trip from Bath to Stonehenge, Avebury, Lacock, Castle Combe and back to Bath. Stay in bath for a few hours (we‚Äôd arrive back at 5:30pm) for dinner/drinks and then make my way back to Clifton.

Day 3- Glastonbury and Wells- I‚Äôm meeting a friend in Wells - no real itinerary other than to possibly eat at Root. May do more exploring in Bristol? 

Day 4- travel to Cardiff for Six Nations game. I don‚Äôt have tickets yet but friends have assured me I can most likely get one day of the match-is this true? Even if I can‚Äôt get a ticket, I will hole up in a pub to watch the game hopefully(could use a recommendation here). Head back to Bristol. 

Day 5- check out of Airbnb early and make my way back to London. Short stop along the way in Swindon. My mum was born there so I promised. Leave bags at hotel in Kensington and hop tube to Camden (noonish). Do the market and pints at Hawley and food somewhere along the way. Head back to my hotel in Kensington. 

Day 6- this is my last real day in London so I‚Äôm not sure how I want to spend it. I‚Äôll be near Notting Hill and Chelsea.. could do at least one museum but still haven‚Äôt decided which- I am leaning toward the V&A.I have an afternoon tea scheduled that day at my hotel (Ampersand) Definitely want to hit up Churchill and possibly Devonshire?

Day 7- check out and make way back to Heathrow. I will not have a car for any of this so it‚Äôs all public transport aside from the day trip that I‚Äôd book with a tour company.

Initially, I thought it was suspicious, so I tried to call her out on it ...and then just accepted her explanation, like maybe that is how it happened.

1hu9kht,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hu9kht/coffee_might_not_be_helping_me_after_all/,Coffee might not be helping me after all,"I've been having issues with concentration, procrastination and have been in a war with my own brain for as long as i can remember. Although i have so many things i want to do, i just never seem to get around to it. Not that i don't want to, i really \*really\* do. I just can't sit down and make the conscious decision of starting. And if i do, its in bursts or never, pilling up and overlapping with other things that need to be done and as you can imagine, a complete chaos.

Today i decided to do an experiment and not drink coffee the moment i wake up. And holy shit i could memorize 2 whole history pages(i know rookie number but i'm trying ok) with terms and numbers within 2:30 hours with some pauses in between. For the first time in a while i felt relaxed and not anxious during examination, and i could recall all the details.

I love the taste of coffee so much, and there have been times where i cut it off a lot when i first started drinking coffee because of insomnia. On and off for months on end so i rarely get headaches when im not drinking coffee now. I can only suspect that my body is so used to the coffee, but not my brain. 

I don't want to cut it off my routine but it means that i have to get my work done before enjoying my lovely cup of coffee. I haven't tried decaf, nor do i really want to unless it does have the same taste, for that i am unsure. I know decaf coffee isn't completely decaf and has but a small amount that could satisfy that coffee feel, but it does have more chemicals than regular coffee. And again you may say well even the tomatoes you eat have chemicals, so why eat them? Fair argument but I don't want to have yet another thing in my list with chemicals. Plus it's expensive and with this years economic statistics, from where i am we had a 15% increase in coffee and some other products, and i'm trying to save money as much as i can. 

  
I am trying to slowly replace coffee with tea (sage tea is so amazing) but i just can hardly resist a cup of coffee. I guess i'll try to maybe consume a smaller dose and only after i've completely finished my work for the day. 

  
I don't know how to categorise this post, if it has any meaning at all but i want to know what are your observations and experiences with coffee. Anyways thank you for reading my post!

One reason why [scientists struggle](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241223-mushy-ice-and-lost-kit-the-scientists-studying-antarctica-as-it-melts) to study Antarctica as it melts is because mushy ice is bad for traveling to dive sites‚Äîtoo thin to go on land and too thick for boats. In some areas, there are only 5-10 days, per year, where scientists can safely access a site. And in the Arctic, [the growth of vegetation](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-arctic-trees-world-warmer.html) is said to be doing more harm than good because ‚Äúthe **warming effect of the lower albedo** of trees exceeds the cooling effect of the carbon they take from the atmosphere.‚Äù 

>‚ÄúIn northern boreal and Arctic regions, **tree planting results in net warming** due to increased surface darkness (decreased albedo), which counteracts potential mitigation effects from carbon storage in areas where biomass is limited and of low resilience. Furthermore, tree planting disturbs pools of soil carbon, which store most of the carbon in cold ecosystems, and has **negative effects on native Arctic biota** and livelihoods. Despite the immediate economic prospects that northern tree planting may represent, this approach does not constitute a valid climate-warming-mitigation strategy in either the Arctic or most of the boreal forest region.

The study‚Äôs lead author [explains](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-wildfire-surged-ice-age-abrupt.html): ‚ÄúIt probably went something like: Ocean currents slowed down or sped up rapidly, the northern hemisphere cooled or warmed rapidly, and then this caused abrupt shifts in tropical rainfall that lead to increased drought and fire.‚Äù

1hu9jeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/comments/1hu9jeq/ken_korczak/,KEN KORCZAK,"This is a true mind-bending story of a Minnesota man who piloted a UFO across space- time.

So, I noticed that the Dean of Ufology, Grant Cameron, has been focusing for some time on a rare and peculiar aspect of the UFO experience.

It is abductees, contactees‚Äô and/or sundry experiencers who report that ‚ÄúThe Others‚Äù sometimes encourage or even insist that people try their hand at piloting a UFO. In all cases, this is accomplished by the melding of the mind of the person with the consciousness of the UFO itself.

Cameron explores this phenomenon in-depth in his new book, UFO Sky Pilots. In it, he shares the reports of ten experiencers, folks from all occupations, who have been granted the extraordinary privilege of flying a UFO. As it turns out, the greater implications that fall out of this scenario are far more profound and wide-ranging than you might imagine.

Kvande relates his lifetime of UFO and alien interaction in his book, they are two long-time Minnesota MUFON top investigators, Bill McNeff, and Craig R. Lang. Both McNeff and Lang said they consider Roger Kvande among the most credible UFO experiencers they have interviewed out of hundreds investigated over many years. Prolific and bestselling British author Nick Redfern judged Kvande to be a ‚Äúpar excellence‚Äù example of a UFO phenomenon experiencer.

I have also had some communication with Mr. Kvande as well. I can tell you that he is not fake. In fact, he has enjoyed a decades-long and successful career in the electronics-computer sector. Before he retired, he was the Senior Scientific Programmer at Unisys, IBM in Rochester, MN. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial electronics at Bemidji State University. His skills have been in much demand over the years. He has worked for many of the biggest names in the industry.

Grant Cameron notes in his book that, among all the UFO pilot experiencers he has interviewed, most say they flew the craft only once.

In Kvande‚Äôs case, however, he has ‚Äúflown the ship‚Äù multiple times.

¬†He began piloting a UFO from the time he was a child and into adulthood. Indeed, he developed an intensely personal relationship with a UFO he came to call simply, ‚ÄúShip.‚Äù Kvande describes Ship as an A.I. with its own intelligence. In some respects, Ship is like Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù or Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSiri,‚Äù except a million times wiser, more knowledgeable, and more powerful. Ship is ever ready to answer Kvande‚Äôs questions and offer advice. For example, as Kvande was flying over the super-flat plains of the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota-Dakota, he casually wondered why the landscape was so flat.

Ship read his mind and instantly flooded his consciousness with a geological history lesson dating back to the last Ice Age. It showed him how various earth forces acted over thousands of years to create the pool table terrain of northeast North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and southern Manitoba. But Kvande also said this downloaded history lesson quickly became overwhelming. The amount of information poured into his mind was voluminous to the point of disorientation.

In Cameron‚Äôs book, most of the UFO pilots report flights into space, to other planets or sometimes to points on planet Earth, but in Kvande‚Äôs case, Ship can take him not only to the far corners of the universe but backward and forward through time. Furthermore, Ship can assist Kvande in interacting with his past lives and future lives as in reincarnation-type scenarios. Ship is a source of predictive information as well, such as showing or warning Kvande of possible future catastrophic events. In one instance, for example, Ship shows Kvande a future day in which a supernova is blazing menacingly in Earth‚Äôs sky.

¬†‚ÄúMY COMMUNICATION WITH MR. KVANDE‚Äù

After I published a book review of Extraterrestrial Odyssey in 2017, Roger Kvande reached out to me to thank me for my positive comments. We then further engaged in a short dialogue after that. He provided me with some additional fascinating information about Ship.

‚ÄúWhen I flew Ship, I was within the body of the beast being fed oxygen, food I was protected,‚Äù Kvande said. Ship was designed to find a newly forming solar system and then help planets develop their environments.

It assists in life cycles that produce planets that hold water and can nurture new life.

¬†‚ÄúWHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF IT?‚Äù

I realize that many who read this, even UFO proponents, will find their belief systems stressed to breaking point by Kvande‚Äôs story. What helps his case, however, is that many witnesses, without a doubt witnessed what was certainly a significant and spectacular UFO event that occurred in Bagley in April of 1966. At the time, the story received some national attention.

For example, the Bagley incident was reported in Flying Saucers, a Chicago-based magazine edited by the once-famous Raymond A. Palmer. A significant and influential figure in the field of science fiction, Palmer was the former long-time editor of the pulp science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.

Raymond Palmer also was a co-founder of FATE magazine, at one time the largest circulation paranormal-topic magazine of its kind in the world. FATE is still published today. Anyway, Ray Palmer placed this blurb in the March 1967 issue of Flying Saucers magazine (which he also created and edited):

April 22, 1966, Bagley (Minnesota) Several people were said to have observed an object fly at low altitude and land outside Bagley. Four dwarfs seemed to make repairs, then the craft flew away.

(Note: Kvande said that there were four gray aliens with him inside the UFO during his flying adventures).

Still, many of you might be saying: ‚ÄúYou know, Ken, a blurb in a low-circulation UFO mag from the 1960s is not much to hang your hat on.‚Äù

Well, there is a lot more information to suggest that the 1966 Bagley UFO flyover really happened.

This, in addition to the considerable recorded public record notations and the embedded lore of the April 1966 UFO event in Bagley, Minnesota, make this one of the most interesting cases in ufology. I return now to Minnesota MUFON investigators Bill McNeff and Craig Lang. They report a conversation with a certain Art Sampsel of Bunker Hill, Indiana.

Mr. Sampsel said that a friend of his was in the tiny town of Goodridge, Minnesota, attending a farm sale. Goodridge is about fifty miles from Bagley. At the farm sale, Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend reports that he overheard two local farmers from Bagley discussing the April 1966 UFO storming of Main Street.

They described the event as Roger Kvande said it happened, including the fact that the school bus, nearly collided with it before landing ‚Äúon the outskirts of town.‚Äù The two Bagley farmers added that the ‚Äúentire town was in a panic.‚Äù Finally, I can tell you this, as a NW Minnesota resident, have traveled through and stopped for a time on many occasions in the town of Bagley over the years. My brother lives in the nearby city of Bemidji. On one trip, back in the 1990s, I stopped at a convenience store gas station that was also a bait shop and there I overheard a conversation by some local elderly guys spending time together and drinking coffee. They were discussing the very same story as presented by Mr. Sampsel‚Äôs friend at the Goodridge farm sale, and the details of the bait shop guys were identical.¬†[https://extratraterrestrialodyssey.com/](https://extratraterrestrialodyssey.com/)

1hu9id8,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravelitinerary/comments/1hu9id8/first_draft_itinerary/,First draft itinerary ,"
This is my first trip to the UK and I have reasons for staying where I am that I won‚Äôt go into here. However, I would love some input as I‚Äôm reading a lot of differing opinions regarding day trips. I‚Äôm going in Feb so I imagine the weather won‚Äôt be fantastic for a lot of outdoor exploring. 

Day 1- arrive in London (hopefully on time) before 9 am. Grab a coffee and the nearest sausage roll and catch bus to Bristol. I imagine I will be exhausted after flying all night so I was planning just to check into my Airbnb(in Clifton) and sleep a bit. Get up early evening and find some place nearby to grab food and a nice pint.

Day 2 - Thursday- considering a day trip from Bath to Stonehenge, Avebury, Lacock, Castle Combe and back to Bath. Stay in bath for a few hours (we‚Äôd arrive back at 5:30pm) for dinner/drinks and then make my way back to Clifton.

Day 3- Glastonbury and Wells- I‚Äôm meeting a friend in Wells - no real itinerary other than to possibly eat at Root. May do more exploring in Bristol? 

Day 4- travel to Cardiff for Six Nations game. I don‚Äôt have tickets yet but friends have assured me I can most likely get one day of the match-is this true? Even if I can‚Äôt get a ticket, I will hole up in a pub to watch the game hopefully(could use a recommendation here). Head back to Bristol. 

Day 5- check out of Airbnb early and make my way back to London. Short stop along the way in Swindon. My mum was born there so I promised. Leave bags at hotel in Kensington and hop tube to Camden (noonish). Do the market and pints at Hawley and food somewhere along the way. Head back to my hotel in Kensington. 

Day 6- this is my last real day in London so I‚Äôm not sure how I want to spend it. I‚Äôll be near Notting Hill and Chelsea.. could do at least one museum but still haven‚Äôt decided which- I am leaning toward the V&A.I have an afternoon tea scheduled that day at my hotel (Ampersand) Definitely want to hit up Churchill and possibly Devonshire?

Day 7- check out and make way back to Heathrow. I will not have a car for any of this so it‚Äôs all public transport aside from the day trip that I‚Äôd book with a tour company. I have purchased a visitor oyster card which I hope will take care of most of my travel expense. I‚Äôm open to any and all suggestions. 

Previous posts have said to skip Stonehenge but I feel that I might kick myself if I don‚Äôt go. Seems silly to go look at a few rocks from a few hundred feet but as an American- it‚Äôs the stuff you dream of seeingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe day trip is the part I‚Äôm really waffling on mainly because of the weather. I can handle a little cold rain, but would I be better off saving it for a better time of year? ",1,1736091162.0,uktravelitinerary,0,0.99,False

A couple of days ago, I suggested we meet in person for a coffee. We connected during the holidays so schedules were a little hectic, or else I would have suggested a meet up much sooner then two weeks from the start of a tinder conversation. After I sent the suggestion, she went silent for the rest of the day, which I thought was a little odd but didn‚Äôt overthink. The next day, I sent her a casual ‚ÄúHey, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù message, and that‚Äôs when things took a turn.

She responded by saying things like:

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCoffee is an errand.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCoffee screams looking for a hook-up.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt makes sense in girl world, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to you.‚Äù

She then concluded by saying we‚Äôre not looking for the same things and ended it. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, am I missing something here? Is she just batshit crazy? ",5,1736090369.0,dating_advice,25,0.73,False

Let's be careful kahit saan tayo pumunta din. BGC ain't that safe anymore as what is portrayed since madami naman nakakapasok dyan since it's open for everyone. Madami security pero syempre di maiiwasan may masalisihan din or napagaralan na nila galaw at pwesyo ng mga guards all around. 
Lalo tuwing Gabi kasi dyan madaming tao and activities eh lalo kapag weekends. Sa dami ba naman ng mga walking distance na area around BGC na pwede pagmulan ng mga people who can do petty crimes. 
It's safe most of the time pero meron at meron makakasalisi talaga.
I remember one time may mga lumapit sa akin mga 5 people early morning sa High street trying to solicit (from a religious group daw) that's around 6:30am ng Saturday. Halatang bagong salta or nilagay sila doon para mag pwesto. Mabilis dumating ang guard since bawal gawin yun doon.

However she‚Äôs very hard to read and doesn‚Äôt really text at all between hang outs. Even on the app when we matched she barely texted anything. We just met right away, really not much banter on app. 

But yet, in person she‚Äôs very engaging, we talk, laugh,  and it‚Äôs nice. Then at the end of the first two dates, she was the one to ask ‚Äúhang out again?‚Äù  I was like F yeah! 

So, I would say she likes me, I‚Äôm not questioning that. I have not went in for a kiss, I don‚Äôt feel that I can, but I may ask her. We hugged at the end of dates one and two. 

Could be she‚Äôs still feeling it out and isn‚Äôt sure about me? Maybe date 3 is a turning point?
Or, maybe I am too anxious and need to just let things happen organically. 

I was thinking about broaching this on our date today.  Tell her how much I like spending time with her. And maybe say ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt seem like a texter during the week, what is your preferred style of communicating while we date?‚Äù   

What do you think?

I am especially anxious I guess because I REALLY like this one. I matched with a couple dozen women the past couple weeks but this one is special. I think she‚Äôs pretty amazing and unique.  I would jump over barrels to see her.

[$700.00]","Hello there! Just a beginner here that needs some help. I'm currently looking at 3 options to choose from and need a bit of feedback on what everyone would choose before I pull the trigger. 

A bit about my situation: I already have a few pourover setups with a v60, hario switch and fellow aiden with a baratza virtuoso as my grinder. This is my first venture into Espresso, I've never even used a machine before. I typically get 4 shots espresso americanos or lattes when I go to the coffee shop, and my wife drinks lattes and breves, so milk drinks are important. We do have two little ones so speed is nice.

The options I'm looking at:
1. Df64 Gen 2 and the Breville Bambino.
2. Df54 and the Breville Bambino Pro
3. Df54 and Gaggia Classic Pro (possibly evo pro?)

My thought process is if I go with the option 1, Df64 and bambino, I can upgrade the grinder later with the 64mm burrs, and the grinder is the most important.

If i go with option two, df54 and bambino pro, I'll get the 3 way solenoid valve on the espresso machine. The auto milk steamer would be nice to learn with but I do want to learn how for the future. 

If I go with option three, df54 and gaggia classic pro, I could use a smart switch for heat up in the mornings on the machine, I can upgrade the machine in the future. 

So essentially it comes down to upgrade the grinder or machine in the future.

I moved here from Spain when I had my daughter at 20 and now she is 10!! I always thought I‚Äôd have things more figured out by the time she started school, but here I am. 

Adapting to the culture and less social way of life was super hard and it still is. I have now had a boyfriend for almost six years, but living here is really dull. At 30 I have also realised that if I ever want to travel or do something I need to plan or save up now. 

For me to move or study abroad for instance would require a great deal and from my understanding the work culture is much harder. I have kind of settled for a three month trip to the places I‚Äôd love to go before my daughter starts high school. That way I can actually manage realistically, but also I get the feeling I don‚Äôt want to go home once I am there haha. 

I have brought up the idea of travelling for 2-3 months, but my bf isn‚Äôt very optimistic. He isn‚Äôt straight up negative, but he doesn‚Äôt see the point and says things like ‚Äúwhat would you do there for a month?‚Äù. So we are really on two different planets because to me it would be like finally living, meeting people, feeling warmth on my skin, eating great food and the culture! It‚Äôs like the only spice I‚Äôll probably get in this lifetime if I can never move. 

His way of travelling and looking at holidays is conventional and I have tried to embrace it or at least try it out. However, that also means that he wants to spend a lot of money for less than a two week trip. Usually it is one week at a fancy hotel and the amount of money is not worth it to me.. he has offered to pay before, but that doesn‚Äôt sit right either. If I‚Äôll ever have a chance to go for the 3 months I really can‚Äôt stop thinking about then I need to save up. I also might want to study more and all that is costly. I do however also appreciate more simple pleasures like coffee dates with friends or a weekend getaway, but I don‚Äôt need fancy holidays in a bubble. I want to much rather rent a space and live like I‚Äôm a local. 

I‚Äôm a little down because I feel like he just expects me to be exactly like him and usually it‚Äôs him wanting this exact holiday and asks if he should book it. He gets upset because he just wants us to have a good time, but I also believe that he has this need and not me. I struggle with different things health wise so for me to travel a lot back and forth for just a week is really exhausting. Longer stays gives me the opportunity to settle in while he gets bored..

I feel like this deserves a proper convo. Well anyway thank you for any input on this. Ready to be told I am unrealistic and I sometimes wonder why I am like this. It is like I miss home, but I also haven‚Äôt found it. For now I try to save money, and ask him about places he‚Äôs love to see as well.

I need your help! I recently tried Afnan 9pm, and while the dry-down was decent (that vanilla and sweetness finally showed up), the opening was way too synthetic and fresh for me. That pear and ambroxan combo felt like a cheap air freshener, and I was ready to write it off, until the dry-down saved it a little.

But let‚Äôs talk about Khamrah Qahwa. Oh. My. God. This fragrance is so delicious, I almost mistook it for a fancy coffee drink and considered taking a sip. It‚Äôs warm, spicy, sweet, and gourmand‚Äîlike a cinnamon-vanilla latte with a shot of amber and a sprinkle of magic. I‚Äôm obsessed.

I also enjoyed JPG Le Male Le Parfum, it gave me that same ‚ÄúI want to drink this‚Äù feeling with its creamy, spicy, and sweet profile. But Khamrah Qahwa is my true love right now.

So, I‚Äôm on the hunt for more fragrances that capture that same warm, spicy, and sweet vibe.

He decided to take the day off, daydreaming of what it would be like to have someone. He had always been fond of Grom despite them never talking.

I‚Äôm interested in a local, male-identified person over 30 who is single, politically progressive, non-religious and intentionally childfree. Bonus points if you're not allergic to cats, as [I have one](https://imgur.com/a/J2Yn3W2). :3 I am not looking for casual dating. My goal is developing a long-term relationship and a fulfilling DINK life.

I'm soon to be 47 in February and presently live in Raleigh, NC. My lease is up in May and I may move closer to my sister in the Charlotte area. When I say local, I mean within about a 2 hour drive of either of those locations.

A couple of deal-breakers: I am firmly childfree‚ÄîI have no children, don‚Äôt want any, and seek a partner who feels the same. I also follow a strict ketogenic diet (very low carb) for health reasons. While I don't expect you to eat exactly as I do, it‚Äôs important you‚Äôre comfortable with a meat-based diet that includes a variety of non-root vegetables (preferably cooked in butter, yum!) since that's a big part of my meals and I enjoy sharing them with a partner.

I‚Äôm an [ENFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality) with love languages focused on physical touch, quality time, and words of affirmation. Politically, I'm liberal/progressive, pro-choice, LGBTQ+ supportive and BLM-aligned. I‚Äôm an atheist who enjoys various Buddhist philosophies. I‚Äôm generally cheerful, expressive and optimistic, though I can be a bit cynical on certain topics. I love engaging, deep conversations on various topics and value emotional self-awareness and vulnerability. If you've done meaningful work in therapy, you're at the top of my list! I lean demisexual and prefer building emotional and mental connections before getting physical. I value a partner who takes care of their health and well-being. I want to enjoy our golden years enjoying what life has to offer together, not spend them caring for someone who neglected their health.

I‚Äôm enjoy daily walks outdoors, hiking, Miatas (I'm on my 4th!), meditation twice a day, Halloween, coffee, board games, TTRPGs, Renaissance Faires, ballroom and period dancing, working on cars, evidence-based science, cats, fireflies, socializing, psychology, Rock Band, audiobooks, Star Trek and historical tours at the local cemetery. I'm not into sports or anime, don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or use drugs, and my video game interests are as recent as XBOX360 (see: Rock Band).

I adult quite well‚Äîpaying bills, excellent credit score, keeping things clean, cooking at home, etc. But let's keep it real: I don‚Äôt have everything figured out. My career journey a winding road that I'm still trying to sort out. Like many xennials, I was told a degree would open doors, however, grad school was probably my worst financial mistake. I also grew up being told that housing was a good investment and that housing would be affordable; both of those cannot be true. With my luck, I'll use my first time home buyer's discount in a 55+ community long after I'm qualified to be in one. lol Like I said, I can be cynical on some topics, too.

A quick note: if you like having a TV on all the time as ""background noise"" or use fragrances (cologne, air fresheners, etc.), we probably won‚Äôt be a great match. The former is a personal preference and the latter is a medical issue.

If you‚Äôre interested, send me a chat message with your age, childfree status, and location, plus something we have in common and anything else you would like to share. I‚Äôm not interested in generic ‚Äúhey‚Äù or other low-effort messages. If we click, I'll suggest we move to Discord as my preferred reddit alternative.

As the name implies this will be a bit long. I can't keep a dream diary because most of my dreams are at least this nuanced. I hope to at least offload the weirdest ones here once in awhile. 

Hard to address how many people were in this dream, basically my entire graduating high school class with a few amalgamated teachers added in. Occasionally the class was separated during interactions by gender. This is hot on the heels of two other dreams regarding high school peeps, one a specific friend who mentioned the herbal remedy ""Bacopa"" and one also including the whole class in an ""assembly meeting"" dream. I rarely stay for the meeting. I seem to be reviewing past likes and dislikes and weeding myself and my choices out from those around me. 

The dream in question: 
I was at my ""fathers house"". This is a large 2 story structure made almost entirely of high strength glass and industrial steel beams held together with bolted plates, like a greenhouse; however it is not enclosed in most areas at least not by its own construction. It may be under a large tent of some kind. The entire structure surrounds a ""nice smelling"" cedar or other light/bright hardwood ""attic"", which appears to have a downstairs section and also contains a bathroom (yes this is a nice little dream bathroom that is basically a wooden porta John but incredibly modest as dream bathrooms go, especially considering rest of the house is glass)

I spend a fair amount of time exploring and being updated on the repairs needed to this house, as well as making foolish choices on where to sit and stand resulting in being dragged from the edge by excess dream gravity in a few situations. I expressed some distress but an old white haired woman chided me relating how I had been here before and should know better. I did not disagree. Apparently the house was rented to a pregnant couple who had managed to break some areas.

I snuck off after touring the uncomfortable part of the structure with a few male friends into the ""attic"". The space, like the rest of the house, I am familiar with, is always mysteriously sunlit by windows on the left side and consists of 5 or so mini rooms, separated by beams and rafters, and frought with spider webs so thick they look like fishermans nets. They are old and no longer sticky but we always avoid them when we crawl through the space out of respect. Finally we make it to the treasure room, which is a large room partially lined with big shelves, stacked with various antique games from pinball machines to scrabble. It's like an arcade, also covered by spiderwebs, but softer and the air is comfortable despite there no longer being windows. The dream changes scenes.

We are filing from the glass house. The whole high school class is going on a cruise as an optional field trip, including parents as chaperons. My mom and dad paid for me and them to go, even though I did not really want to; I had to log on to the ticket app and confirm my purchase still and contemplated not going. Some female acquaintances around me sounded excited and were incredulous about my trepidation. The class is walking in a neat file towards a big heathered field in a clearing near some woods, awaiting sundown. A pleasant mist rises from the ground. We seem to inadvertently form a circle in the field and smile at one another from across it, as if in agreement over our contented feelings. As the orange sun sets in the distance, we go to our homes and await the school's chartered buses to pick us up and gather some belongings for the 35 day cruise. 

On the way home i check the cruise/ticket page to confirm and still have these feelings of just not wanting to do it, but feeling like I must because the tickets were like $2000 each. 3 celebs, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and a pretty girl with black curly hair whose name I don't remember, had animated profile pictures because they would headline as the entertainment on the cruise. Gaga was arrogant and huffy, rolling her eyes over and over as if to say ""you know who it is"". Miley was disturbing mouthing ""hail Satan"" and apparently biting the flesh off human body parts. She was covered in blood and bruises. The black haired girl kept getting splashed by water, like a ""money shot"" by a super soaker, then shaking her head, water dripping from her wet curls, and making big doe eyes.

I decide to only take one bag with me, while others bring many suitcases. Standing outside my house I remember how empty it looked inside and worry that we will be leaving my brother at home alone, and hope he will not drink himself to death while we are gone. I reluctantly get on the bus when it comes and find the cold morning air exhilarating. I board the cruise ship anyway, and immediately regret it. I enter a dingey white galley where more boys from class are gathered. They are not thrilled about the early hour and are trying to make coffee. I feel uncomfortable so I exit the galley hoping to find where my mom and dad are staying. The ship has already begun to move

I navigate through several poorly lit corridors where someone appears to have aggressively attempted to remove the evidence of some survival horror type situation. Flickering lights show stacks of clean furniture blocking doors and alleys into the ship bowels. Clearly vacuumed floors with absurdly obvious old blood stains dappling the beige carpet. Additional attempts to remove them from the walls are evident. A double wooden door has a nasty clawed gouge/battering mark on the right side where a handle once was. The whole space has a very still aura. I enter the space beyond it and the ship is in a bit better shape, blue carpets and wood paneling on the walls and observation decks to my left and one floor above. I see others getting settled and ease my mind just a bit. Then I climb the flight of steps to open air observation to see the ship is skirting the cliffs in a known dream town preparing to ""shoot the gap"" for a speed boost. The ship does an about face and begins traveling at a high speed through an ""ocean rapids"" canal; a large basin that channels ocean force like a 2 sided lengthwise dam. Holding on for dear life, I have to duck so the highway overpasses don't take me or my head clean off the ship. 

That's all this time. The ocean rapids canal is not new to me. Much of the scenery in this dream is the same as others I have had except the scenario (whole class cruise) and celebs/survival horror details.

1hu8nph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Numerology4Millennial/comments/1hu8nph/can_numerology_tell_your_future/,Can numerology tell your future?,"Numerology doesn‚Äôt predict your exact future, but it can offer insights into potential patterns, challenges, and opportunities in your life. Think of it less like a crystal ball and more like a roadmap‚Äîit helps you understand the energies surrounding you so you can make better choices or navigate life‚Äôs twists and turns with more clarity.

At its core, numerology is all about the symbolism of numbers and how they interact with your personal life. Your **Life Path Number**, calculated from your birthdate, gives a broad picture of your personality and life purpose. For example, someone with a Life Path Number 5 might find that they‚Äôre drawn to adventure, change, and freedom. While numerology can‚Äôt tell you *what* will happen tomorrow, it can highlight the types of experiences or tendencies you‚Äôre likely to encounter.

Full Millennial Numerology guide [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1836861726).

A big part of numerology‚Äôs predictive aspect comes from **personal year cycles**, which align with the numbers 1 through 9 and represent recurring themes in your life. For instance, if you‚Äôre in a 1 year, it‚Äôs often a time for new beginnings, big changes, or fresh starts. Contrast that with a 9 year, which is about closure, reflection, and letting go. While these cycles won‚Äôt spell out exactly what‚Äôs going to happen, they can provide a helpful lens for understanding the phase of life you‚Äôre in and what might feel natural or rewarding to focus on.

For example, imagine you‚Äôre deciding whether to launch a new project. If numerology suggests you‚Äôre in a 1 year, it might feel like the perfect time to take that leap. On the other hand, a 7 year‚Äîfocused on introspection and planning‚Äîmight encourage you to spend time refining your ideas instead of jumping into action. Numerology gives you the tools to align your decisions with the ""flow"" of the energy around you, making life feel a bit less random.

Another interesting aspect is the role of repeating numbers or ""angel numbers."" Have you ever noticed the same numbers popping up in your life, like seeing 11:11 on the clock or 333 on a license plate? Numerology interprets these as signs or nudges, often encouraging you to pay attention to certain aspects of your life. While it‚Äôs not a direct ""prediction,"" it can feel like the universe is pointing you toward something meaningful‚Äîlike focusing on personal growth, relationships, or a specific decision.

Of course, numerology isn‚Äôt foolproof, and it‚Äôs not meant to replace practical decision-making or deep introspection. It‚Äôs more about giving you a framework to reflect on your experiences and align your choices with your natural tendencies. For instance, if numerology suggests you‚Äôre naturally ambitious (hello, Life Path 8), and you notice opportunities that align with leadership or financial success, you might feel encouraged to pursue them.

But does this mean numerology can ""see the future""? Not really. It‚Äôs not going to tell you that you‚Äôll win the lottery next week or meet your soulmate at a specific coffee shop on a Thursday afternoon. Instead, it provides context for understanding the bigger picture‚Äîlike why certain themes keep recurring in your life or why a particular phase feels especially challenging or transformative.

Some people like to pair numerology with other tools, like astrology, tarot, or journaling, to deepen their understanding of what‚Äôs happening in their lives. Together, these tools can create a richer, more intuitive way to look at the future. For example, if your numerology points toward a year of relationships and your astrological chart emphasizes Venus (the planet of love), you might feel extra motivated to work on strengthening connections with others.

The real magic of numerology lies in how you use it. By reflecting on the numbers‚Äô meanings, you can tune into opportunities, recognize patterns, and make decisions that feel aligned with your personal energy. While it won‚Äôt hand you a crystal-clear picture of the future, it can help you feel more connected to the path you‚Äôre on and more empowered to shape it.

So, can numerology tell your future? Not in a literal sense‚Äîbut it can help you understand the flow of life and the kinds of experiences that might resonate with you. Think of it as a guide, not a guarantee. The future is still yours to create, and numerology just offers a little extra inspiration along the way. üòä

I‚Äôve also gotten highest in my grade for Math (this year) And French

EC‚Äôs: Visited multiple farms and estates through high school, with great rec letters. I started a fundraiser to maximise positive socioeconomic impact through the purchase of new technologies for small scale farmers. I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc‚Ä¶). I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop websites to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month :).

School related EC‚Äôs: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired multiple committees in Model United Nations, i will also be applying for a position in the secretariat next year, hopefully I get in :). In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children. I also helped provide stationary for all the students at the school.

1hu8iz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodySwapMemes/comments/1hu8iz2/aitah_swapping_with_my_castmate/,AITAH - Swapping with my castmate,"AITAH?

My castmate (29, M) and I (F, 58) switched bodies before we got cast in a show at our local community theatre. I helped him get a role that he didn‚Äôt think he could get by swapping bodies with him, and now he‚Äôs upset because I want to be the one to perform that role for ALL the performances. 


Context below:

About six weeks ago, me and another member of our local theatre community, Zach, were auditioning for the play ‚ÄúDeath of a Salesman‚Äù. Now, Zach and I have known each other for a few years, and we recently did a musical together called ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù, which is a very popular show. I played the witch and he played one of the princes. Zach is a great actor and has a tremendous look, so he became a fan favorite of that show. And that was a bit tough on me, since the witch is really the most memorable character. 

When it was announced that our community theatre was going to put on Death of a Salesman, I was ecstatic. It‚Äôs a small cast, and there‚Äôs only one female role, but it‚Äôs Linda Loman, the wife of Willy Loman and the mother of Biff and Happy Loman. And the character is around my age, so I felt this was perfect for me. 

I spoke to Zach before the auditions, as he came into the coffe shop I own with his girlfriend, and we chatted about the show. He really wantted to play the male lead, Biff Loman. Biff is such a fascinating character, and it‚Äôs right up Zach‚Äôs alley, but he was nervous. Though I‚Äôm not sure why. Sure, other men would audition, but Zach is super talented and this would be great for him. He said he considered not auditioning but his girlfriend Crystal convinced him that he should do it. 

Then I got an idea. I asked him if he wanted to use the swap app to trade bodies with me. That way, I can audition for him, and he can audition as me. His face lit up. He really liked that idea. He thought it would be cool to audition for me, and felt less pressure since there was only one female part, and he trusted in my ability to get him the role he wanted more than he trusted in his own ability.

We met up the day of auditions, downloaded the swap app, and switched bodies. It was a wild experience to be a 29 year old again, let alone a 29 year old man! Zach seemed to do okay, though he looked a bit out of place. Still, he put on a smile, grabbed my purse, and went into the green room where all the other actors were waiting to audition.

After some time, Zach finally got called back to read for Linda Loman, and he was gone for a while. He eventually came out with a big grin on his face and nodded to me, indicating that it went well. He sat next to me and told me that they loved his audition piece, and asked him to read some sides from the script. 

So, he got a call back and it went well. I was pleased. I knew he‚Äôd do great, and I was excited to play Linda after we switched back. Then they called for ‚ÄúZach‚Äù, and I stood up and auditioned I front of the director of the play and the director of the theatre program. 

And it was the best audition I‚Äôd ever given. I felt energized and relaxed all at the same time. The play director then asked me to read for the part of Biff! I was estatic. I read for Biff and I could see I had both directors following my every word. They both turned to each other and gave each other a slight nod. At that moment I knew the role was Zach‚Äôs. 

I was giddy. I walked out of the greenroom and gave Zach a thumbs up. He looked so pleased. We chatted for a few minutes until the stage manger came into the greenroom and pinned the cast list to the bulletin board. 

Everyone gathered around and took turns looking before Zach and I could view it. And once we were able to see it, we were both thrilled. Our names were listed, his for the role of Biff, and mine for the role of Linda. 

It was great. Everyone congratulated us and we congratulated the others who were cast. Then we had a meeting with the director. The show would open in 6 weeks and we had a lot of work to do. 

As we left the theatre, Zach thanked me again and indicted that he was ready to swap back. 

Only, the problem is..that I wasn‚Äôt.

Look, I know it went against our agreement, but when I saw his name on that cast list, I felt a sense of pride. *I* auditioned for that role, so it should go to me‚Ä¶right? I mean, this was an opportunity of a lifetime. I‚Äôm a 58 year old woman and I‚Äôd be playing the role that only men get to play. I‚Äôd be going to a place where no woman has ever been. Heck, I was in a man‚Äôs body, and to my knowledge, only a few women had ever experienced that. So this was special. Especially since I‚Äôm older now and probably would never experience something this exciting ever again.

So, I thought of a new agreement. What if I keep his body for the six weeks and then play the part on opening night. THEN we can switch back. He can live my life in the meantime, and I‚Äôll live his. 

How fun!

I explained that to Zach who was taken aback. ‚ÄúBut..but what about our deal? I can‚Äôt just abandon my life for six weeks..‚Äù 

Shoot. I thought I had it figured out. So, I told him my honest thoughts: since I was the one that got him that role, I should be the one to play it. It‚Äôs only fair. I‚Äôll give him his body on opening night after the show, and then we can swap back.

Zach seemed really unsure about the situation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIts one thing to pretend on stage, but to have to live the life of an old lady?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I snapped at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not THAT old (and I look pretty damn good for my age, thank you very much).

Zach put his head down. Then looked back up at me. ‚ÄúWell, you DID land the part. And Crystal went back home yesterday, and won‚Äôt be back in town until the play, so‚Ä¶okay, sure. Let‚Äôs do it. We‚Äôre actors, right? We can impersonate each other. But you have to teach me how to run your coffe shop. And I‚Äôll have to show you how to do my job. Thankfully I work remotely, so if I need to take over, I can do so‚Äù, he gestured down at himself,‚Äùlooking like this.‚Äù

Oh, this was perfect! I‚Äôm glad he saw the light. So we went back to his place and then to mine, and we offered details about our lives and agreed to stay swapped until opening night.

Rehearsals began the next day and I was excited. I had never thought I‚Äôd be playing a man‚Äôs role before, but here I was. Zach showed up and he was ready to get started, too. When the director focused on his scenes, Zach made some great choices, and looked very convincing playing the role of Linda. He really did a great job and received a few compliments from the director and cast. 

Then it was my turn. We rehearsed the scene where Biff is in the restaurant with his dad and brother, and the scene where Biff doesn‚Äôt get hired. It was a great experience, and I really focused and brought it the best that I could. Everyone was stunned. The director was so excited at the results, and this was only day one.

As the weeks went on, I got to enjoy Zach‚Äôs life. I‚Äôd check up on him at the coffee shop and he‚Äôd be in the middle of taking orders and making coffee for customers. 

I‚Äôd have helped him but technically I wasn‚Äôt an employee, so I just watched him do his thing. He survived though! He‚Äôd then go to the back when it was slow and work off his laptop to submit certain data and reply to emails for his job. 

As we got closer to showtime Zach would make comments like ‚ÄúI sure can‚Äôt wait until opening night!‚Äù Or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre almost there. Can‚Äôt wait to not have to wear this bra all the time.‚Äù Uh huh. It‚Äôs been a month, Zach.  Men. üôÑ

So, we finally get to opening night, and he picks out an outfit that he wants me to wear and I help him pick out an outfit that he could wear as me after the show. I chose a black Cocktail Party dress with a flare silhouette for Zach to wear. I wanted him to look his best as me during the opening night reception, and I really like how that dress shows off my legs. 

And for what it‚Äôs worth‚Ä¶I liked the suit he picked out but I felt that he was really doing himself a disservice by not choosing the three piece navy suit he owned. So, I put that one in the garment bag when he wasn‚Äôt looking üòÜ

He‚Äôll be okay though. I‚Äôll make him look good and he‚Äôll thank me when it‚Äôs over. 

Or so I thought.

The show began and we all took our places and performed in front of a packed house. And it was incredible. I did just as I rehearsed and it was the best performance I‚Äôve given in years. Maybe ever. And Zach did an excellent job too! He played the role of Linda so well‚Äîhe‚Äôd probably give me a run for my money! 

When we went out for the curtain call, Zach gave me an odd look as we took our places to bow. He was up first, and got a great response from the audience. He curtsied in his dress (it was so cute üòÜ) and I got to come on last and bow like a man to a standing ovation! I was on top of the world. I looked over at Zach and he held my face in some sort of forced smile while he locked eyes with me. But, it appeared as if he wasn‚Äôt being genuine. And I could tell something was wrong. 

We then came out to the reception area and I found him chatting with some of the patrons of the theatre. They were all telling him what a great job he did. Then he turns to me and his smile completely dissapears. 

He demands to know why I‚Äôm wearing his navy suit when he had a different one picked out. I thought he‚Äôd like the change. I just told him he looks better this way but he stated that I didn‚Äôt have the right to change his attire without his permission. 

A bit of an overreaction, no? He looks better with the navy. I tried telling him.

And before he could continue, his girlfriend Crystal appeared and gave me a big hug. Zach looked completely insecure at seeing Crystal and I think was caught a bit off guard. 

Hey, it‚Äôs not my fault if he forgot she was coming ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We made some small talk and Zach hung around as long as he could but it was clear that something was off. Crystal wanted me all to herself, and Zach was a bit of a third wheel. I think he wanted to switch back but what were we to do? Tell Crystal, ‚ÄúHey, you know what? I‚Äôm actually not your boyfriend, he‚Äôs actually in my body. And I‚Äôm in his. Can you give us a few minutes to switch back, please?‚Äù üòÖ Ha! Get real. 

I looked at Zach and said, ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been great seeing you. You did a wonderful job playing Linda‚Ä¶I guess I‚Äôll see you tomorrow.‚Äù

Zach was not pleased. He gritted his teeth and put on a fake smile before turning to Crystal to tell her that he enjoyed seeing her.  She told him that she enjoyed seeing him, completely oblivious to the fact that she was actually talking to her boyfriend. Zach glared at me before he reluctantly shoveled off to watch us from across the room. 

I didn‚Äôt really want him watching us, so I suggested to Crystal that we go out to eat. Her face lit up and she loved that idea. We went out and I figured I‚Äôd just switch back with Zach later. 

Crystal and I went to a restaurant and I got to talk with her. She‚Äôs a sweet girl, and I did my best to impersonate Zach. However, Zach kept texting me asking where I was and when we could meet up to switch back. He was a little anxious. Poor guy üòÜ

So, after dinner, I told Crystal that I had a great time and thanked her for coming. She said she‚Äôd go visit her parents on the other side of town but wanted to see me tomorrow. 

And then it hit me. This was a great night. Hanging out with Crystal, looking snazzy in a sharp suit, and playing a role I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd get from a play I loved since I first read it back in high school? This was just too good. I couldn‚Äôt swap back YET.

Maybe we could swap back...when the show was over. The final show, that is. 

I mean, I successfully auditioned for the show, went to all the rehearsals, and nailed it on opening night. Zach hasn‚Äôt even rehearsed AS the character Biff, so could he really perform it the way the director wanted it? I mean, he might just screw it up. I‚Äôd really be better off finishing all the performances, which include NEXT Friday and Saturday.

So, I called Zach and he immediately answered, sounding quite nervous. He wanted to know how Crystal was and when I‚Äôm going to be coming over to switch back with him. I told him not to get his panties in a twist ü§£ and asked him why he seems so on-edge. 

He revealed that he had some reservations about staying swapped with me, but went along with it because he thought it would work out. But he went on to say that I haven‚Äôt really been responsible, as I let him do my job and his, without even attempting to help. Further, he said I acted like a bit of a diva backstage earlier tonight, which he believes will ruin his reputation and prevent him from getting cast at that theatre again. THAT‚ÄôS why he was looking at me sideways during the curtain call. 

I took it all in. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs really on point here. First, *I* secured the role. So, I‚Äôm entitled to it. And by extension, I‚Äôm entitled to live  his life. 

Second, He agreed to stay swapped, and in an order to maintain appearances, I couldn‚Äôt just help run the coffee shop. That would look wierd. Right?

So, anyway, point three: I wasn‚Äôt acting like a ‚ÄúDiva‚Äù, I was simply letting Dale (our wardrobe lead) know that my hair is better off parted to the side and not slicked back. I think it does more for the character (and adds a youthfulness to Zach‚Äôs face). I know Dale was just relating a note from the director, but our director is only 43, and I‚Äôve been doing this way longer than him. What does he know? üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I told that to Zach and the kid lost it. He shouted through the phone and demanded we switch back immediately. But..should we though? I get that it‚Äôs his body, but I kind of feel like he‚Äôs being selfish. And definitely a little jealous. He doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm actually better at playing a role than him, and it‚Äôs eating him inside. And with the way he yelled, I‚Äôm getting some misogynistic vibes. He probably hates being a woman because he hates women. This is actually a red flag for Crystal. 

Do you think I should tell her that we swapped? Maybe she needs to know. 

He then said that he‚Äôs coming over to my (his?) apartment to switch back. Before he hung up, he called me an Asshole. I think that‚Äôs going a bit too far. He‚Äôs on his way over here right now, but before he gets here, I want to know‚Ä¶

Am I the asshole here?

One of the primary considerations in such an upgrade is whether there would be a significant improvement in coffee quality and overall grinding performance.



SSP burrs are highly regarded in the coffee community for their precision and the superior materials used in their manufacturing, typically crafted from high-quality stainless steel or other durable alloys. This reputation suggests that upgrading to SSP MP burrs could potentially enhance your coffee experience in several meaningful ways.



Enhanced Grind Consistency: SSP burrs are designed to provide exceptional grind consistency, which can significantly improve flavor clarity and extraction. This can be particularly advantageous for espresso and pour-over methods, where precise grind uniformity is crucial for achieving the best results.



Customization of Flavor Profiles: The unique design and engineering of SSP burrs might allow you to better tailor the flavor profile of your coffee, extracting more nuanced and complex flavors from your beans. This could be especially appealing if you enjoy experimenting with different coffee varieties and brewing techniques.



Improved Durability: Given their robust construction, SSP burrs are built to last, potentially extending the lifespan of your grinder and reducing the frequency of replacements. This durability can lead to long-term savings on maintenance costs.



Investment Consideration: While SSP burrs do represent a financial investment, the potential boost in coffee quality and the pleasure derived from a refined brewing experience could justify the expense for serious coffee enthusiasts.



Ultimately, deciding whether to upgrade your TimeMore Sculptor 78S to SSP MP burrs depends on how much you value the potential improvements in coffee quality and grinding performance. If precision, consistency, and flavor optimization are priorities for you, and you are willing to invest in these enhancements, upgrading to SSP MP burrs could be a worthwhile decision that enhances your coffee experience significantly.",1,1736088306.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1hu8hda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hu8hda/not_sure_if_i_did_the_right_thing/,Not sure if I did the right thing.,"I‚Äôm a 20y female entrepreneur. Recently during a business event, a CEO of a pretty big company approached me and said that he was interested and asked if we could discuss a collaboration separately. I agreed and said I would meet him in the hotel lobby after the event was over (the event was inside the hotel).
I was super excited because if I could strike this deal, it would take my startup to the next level. I immediately told my parents and they were super happy for me.

Fast forward to after the event, I met him in the lobby and we started talking as we walked. I thought we would go to the coffee shop in the hotel, but I was so engrossed in trying to convince him about my product, that I didn‚Äôt realise he was taking me to his hotel room until I stood in front of the room door.

I was shocked. I know I should have had more spatial awareness, but at the time I was thinking about the deal. As soon as I realised I was in front of his door, I bolted out of there. I didn‚Äôt even listen to his explanation. I ran out of the hotel as fast as I can and went home.

I never told my family about what happened, just said that the business deal fell through.

I‚Äôm still not sure if I did the right thing. Up until we got to his room he was very nice and grandfatherly. Should I have heard him out? Maybe he just wanted to get something? I don‚Äôt know. 

Edit: Thank you all for replying on my post. Deep down I probably knew that I did the right thing but at the same time I wasn‚Äôt really sure. 
I am kind of dumb when it comes to stuff like this, as I grew up very sheltered and in a small town where everybody knew everybody and never had to deal with situations like these. 
My family moved to a bigger state after I finished highschool (was 17 then) and I do my college online, so I have never been put in that type of situation until now. My mom warned me about these types of stuff if I entered this industry, but I guess I never expected it to actually happen to me. 
It might be surprising to hear but even at 20, this business event was probably the first time I‚Äôve been by myself in my whole life. (I have a very big family so even when my parents were busy I was with my uncles family and my grandparents).
This is also the reason I didn‚Äôt want to tell my family because I know they would worry and not want me to go to these events anymore or tell me to find a way around it.",9,1736088238.0,Advice,15,0.84,False

My father also recently passed so all my symptoms and odd going on, me and my doctor chalk it up to that.

Three days ago, my teenage daughter looked at my tummy and asked was I pregnant, half jokingly I suppose, I‚Äôve eaten a lot of things I should over Christmas and have ibs so a swollen stomach is common and obviously Christmas weight gain.

Later that day, I got what I can only describe as intense round ligament pain, I stood up and was freaking out, it stopped after a few minutes but I haven‚Äôt felt that pain since my last pregnancy nearly 9 years ago. But again, just put it down to ibs üòÇ

Last night I felt tickles in my tummy, the same feelings you get before you feel actual movement. Again, just assumed it might be odd ibs pains, but it was so tickly that it was distracting me, so I pushed quite deeply into my lower stomach, where my ‚Äúgrowing womb‚Äù would be and felt intense tickles.

So I think I‚Äôm either insane or pregnant. I would 15/16 weeks on my 4th pregnancy so wouldn‚Äôt be uncommon to feel tickles at this time. 

Scared the doctor will think I‚Äôm insane, and just needed to share! Hope all your pregnancies are going well and you had a lovely Christmas üéÑ

Just finished the final touches on the final model in my first haul of 40K minis last night. I purchased these a couple months ago so figured I'd hop on here and post a few pics now that I've finished this little project of mine as well as talk a little bit about the journey so far. Fore warning this might be the longest reddit post I've ever typed!

A few months back in late August I ended up injuring my shoulder with a grade 3 AC separation which caused me to take a doctor ordered step back from outdoor activities as well as any gym time (Essentially turning me into a big ol' lazy bum ever since). I suffer from depression and PTSD from certain events that have occurred in my life revolving around the deaths of a few people I really loved - but we won't get into those details today! This is a post of positivity!

With that being said.. my outdoor activities are a life line for me and I don't do well sitting indoors for months at a time even though I work from home lol. At first - I had very little mobility in my right arm and my micro-movements were very sporadic and hard to control. I decided to pick up my old drawing and painting hobby to rehab my shoulder a little bit as I wasn't allowed to lift more than a cup of coffee for a few weeks. After a couple weeks they raised that weight limit to 5lbs and eventually 20lbs about 6 weeks into my healing process.

After getting a little bored with my pen and paper shenanigans I picked up another old hobby.. Gunpla! Really enjoyed the few models I put together but it seemed like I would finish even the MG models too fast (2-3 days with transfers and topcoat applied) and wasn't getting my money-time investment I felt like. I wanted something that was going to take me a little bit longer.. Something almost daunting.

As this thought process grew I found myself scrolling YouTube one day and seen this Jay guy (EonsofBattle) putting together what I know now as an Imperial Knight and I was like ""Woahhh! Edgy! Gothic even maybe!? COOL!"" but at the time I still felt like painting a whole model or getting into the hobby was too big of a pain in the ass. The algorithm got me through and recommended the opening scene from Space Marine 2 as well as the  well-renowned  Astartes video and I was hooked lol.

I began diving into the lore and did a little research on the 20 legions as well as the emperor and a little this and a little that. Ya know, 40K rabbit hole YouTube stuff. I was immediately drawn to Black Templars, Grey Knights, Dark Angels.. and you guessed it! Cue the 9th - Blood Angels!  Red being my favorite color my whole life they were the obvious choice. But who picks their legion based on color alone, right? I needed to relate to these guys. I needed to feel like I repped them like a KC native reps the Chiefs in the fall so I dug deeper in their lore. I found their rage and sorrow to be quite relatable based on my own personal conflicts. I found the red thirst and black rage to be even relatable in its own way. I know all too well what it's like to be haunted by visions of a loved one dying. After feeling like I had made the only choice fitting for me it was time to buy some MINIS! Luckily the new combat patrol was coming and I lucked out even more getting a nice 15% discount from CMOgames on a pre-order (You bet your ass I was on there right at 12am)

My local Warhammer store has been quite a help and very supportive of my overall journey. Almost have the battle honours program completed so looking forward to all those free goodies. Just need to learn how to play the game! If im being honest though it never really was about playing the tabletop game. More so just a depressed guy who suffered a debilitating injury and needed a world to dive into to help the healing process. This whole journey has helped me in more ways than one and felt like I just wanted to share with the world how 40K took a depressing past few months and turned it into one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

If you took the time to read all that then I thank you! Any constructive crisicism on my painting is welcome! Took these pics with an iPhone camera so color/lighting is a bit off but did my best to take the best pics I could but I do feel like they photos dull out some of my edge highlights. For reference: the rocky base guy is the first of 3 that I started with. Moving onto the not-so-shitty bases with sand AND rock are the ones I built and painted after my initial 3. Captain was the mini I spent the most time on other than the Dreadnaught. Sanguinary guard I did after my 10 intercessors and Captain. Dreadnaught was the  big finale and overall culmination of my skills acquired so far. First time working with cork but very satisfied with how the big cork rock turned out. Enjoy and thank you for reading/viewing!

It was a rough year and I was struggling both in grad school and coming out of a terrible relationship of sorts (SA and cheating and all sorts of bad stuff). About 5 months after moving I decided to try the dating scene again and matched with this dude on both Tinder and Hinge. Our parents were both from the same country (immigrant parents) and he really wanted to meet. I wasn't super amused with how he treated me: 30 min late to the first date, etc. but I think I was in a bad place and not thinking super straight. I also told him I was coming out of a really bad situation where I was SAed, gotten an STD, etc (that dude was a work of art). I was trying to treat this situation more like a hook-up and not get emotionally involved. I remember after the first time we hooked up, I was very insistent to go home and not spend the night at his place despite his protests. We continued to hook up for several months and he would more or less manipulate me into staying the night and make me coffee in the morning, but would also ghost me for weeks at a time. Lo and behold, about a few months in I was lurking on social media and found that he has a long-distance gf across the country. I called him out for it and he told me that I was crazy and controlling and treating him like a scumbag. He then proceeded to block me on social media and my number.

He moved across the country and his gf has moved in with him and I think they're planning on getting married soon. From what I learned on social media, the girlfriend's family loves him and they spend all the holidays together. Including posting very flattering things about them during the holiday season we were hooking up.

I met my current boyfriend a few months after this all went down and we've been dating for a bit now, however I still struggle with anger at this dude. Specifically about how I was characterized as the villain who accused him of cheating even though ""he's such a nice guy"" and that I was crazy and insane. I feel like I let myself be taken advantage of when I was in a really vulnerable spot and he got off scot free without any repercussions. I'm not sure what I expect to get from posting this on Reddit but I think it helps to internet rant.

When we change it, quite a few beans are left in the grinder (almost a whole cup worth... I scooped it out and weighed it). We can use the grinder purge, but this is so wasteful with us changing the hopper 2-3 times a day since I drink mostly decaf and my husband drinks mostly full caf.

Our workaround right now is using a spoon to scoop out as many of the beans as we can when changing the hopper, but this is tedious and I think defeats the purpose of the machine's automated simplicity. 

Of course I can use the bypass for ground coffee, but then one of us is missing out on the fresh grind and full use of the machine. 

Has anyone else found a better workaround for those who change the bean hopper frequently? I want to love this machine but this is really a design flaw in my opinion.

1hu81hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1hu81hv/contact_her_on_ig_directly_or_am_via_parents/,"Contact her on IG directly, or AM via parents?","Back in September I came across a girl who met a lot of what I was looking for on paper, so I asked one of my cousins (who knows her) to find out whether she was single and if he could get me an introduction. My cousin hadn't spoken to her since college, so he reached out to another mutual friend who confirmed back that yes she's single however not really looking to meet anyone at the moment.

Fast forward to beginning of December, I thought I'd try my luck by sending her a DM on IG (the only way I could of contacted her directly). It was a simple message essentially saying that I asked a mutual friend whether she was single a couple of weeks ago, heard she wasn't looking to meet anyone, however if that's changed then I'd like to give her a better introduction of myself and see if she'd like to meet for a coffee.

I wasn't expecting a reply given the standard success rate of IG DMs, however she ending up messaging back a fortnight later - essentially playing along with a bit of banter to be friendly and asking who the mutual friend was. So I replied back the next day with the backstory, and asked if she'd be up for a phone call or coffee sometime. To which I've been left on read for the past week...

Additionally since then, I've heard her parents have started looking for a groom via AM. So being in a position where I'd still like to pursuit her, I feel I have three options:

* **Option 1** \- Do nothing, and hope she replies back eventually to my last message. However I imagine this is unlikely since it's been over a week.
* **Option 2** \- Send another message on IG. However the challenge with IG is it definitely isn't my forte. I'm fortunate with looks, have an excellent career, and I'd like to think I've cultivated the right character desired of a life partner - however none of this is publicised on any of my social media. With IG I only have a few hundred followers/following, and a private profile so she can't see any pictures outside of my profile picture. She on the other hand has around 20k followers and also extremely good looking - so I imagine she receives plenty of attention from men, which I can understand also makes her cautious of the DMs she receives.
* **Option 3** \- Ask my parents to approach her parents via AM. My parents are wonderful, and we have a good family background. Getting in contact with her parents via social circles won't be too difficult, I'm confident I'll impress her parents, and as an added bonus our families are from the same community/region, same religion, and match in affluence. However I feel going via parents may not make the best impression with her given we've already had some contact.

At the moment I'm leaning towards Option 2. With the rationale that if I were a girl I'd definitely prefer a guy to say the right thing directly to me than to approach via parents - which I feel could be perceived as lacking effort/initiative. However I'm a bit stumped on what that right thing to say is.

I feel like if you make it, you owe it to the rest of the people to share how you did it.

So here‚Äôs how we got our first 100 users in four steps.

The [project](https://buildpad.io/?ref=Reddit) I‚Äôm writing about continued growing and is now at 3,000+ users after about three months since launching.

So this is exactly how we did it, without spending a dollar.

**I'll try to be as concise as possible because I know reading a wall of text is boring.**

I'll start from the beginning:

**1. Coming up with the idea**

How did we come up with our idea?

We experienced a problem ourselves that we wanted to solve.

We knew the pain of the problem and we felt the strong need for a solution ourselves.

We spent a few days on market research, head-scratching, and coffee drinking, then an idea for a solution began to take shape.

We wanted to see if others experienced the problem as well, to make sure building a solution for it would be worth our time.

To check interest, we created a survey and shared it on our target audience's subreddit.

To get people to respond we made sure to offer them something in return for taking the time. In our case it was giving them feedback on their projects. **Give something to get something.**

This can take a few tries so if you don't get many responses > improve post and try again.

**2. Building the product**

We got positive feedback on the idea so went ahead and built an MVP (minimum viable product).

We did this to test the market and to see if people liked the basic version of our product before we commit and spend all the time and effort building a full product.

I highly recommend building an MVP first. It allows you to ship faster, collect feedback, and use that feedback to shape your product into something the market actually wants.

After about 30 days of building, it was finished.

**3. Simple way to get the first users through the door**

To get our first users for it we shared the MVP with the survey participants and did a launch post on their subreddit.

This is a simple way to get your first users because you have already established contact with them, they experience the problem you‚Äôre solving, and they have expressed interest in your idea.

This gave us our first 3 users!

Not bad.

We need more.

**4. Growing from your first users to 100+**

To keep growing our initial user base, we kept posting in communities of our target audience for two weeks.

* Daily posts in the Build in Public community on X (sharing behind-the-scenes of launch, giving advice, connecting with founders).
* Posting every other day in¬†subreddits related to founders on Reddit

These were posts talking about subjects related to our project and would often end with mentioning our product.

Our total users after two weeks..

**100!**



Two weeks, 100 users. It felt amazing! We had never seen this type of hype for our previous projects.

This method:

* Doesn‚Äôt take too much time.
* Doesn‚Äôt take too much effort.
* Doesn‚Äôt cost any money.

You can do it too if you apply yourself.

At this point you've got an MVP and you have your first users. Now all you do is get as much feedback as possible and improve your product.

All the time we've spent improving our product based on user feedback has definitely made marketing easier for us, so I highly recommend it!

So me and my wife only been married about a year before our wedding she had a bachelorette party which is normal she told me that they where going to male strippers in the town i live in i wasnt comfortable with it but i said ok as long as you don‚Äôt go on stage or get pressured into doing anything to which she kinda snapped at me and said ‚Äúi cant believe you would think i would do anything like that you don‚Äôt trust me‚Äù

 she start sending me snaps while shes there of them doing their dances and stuff and i told her i dont want to see that and i dont feel comfortable so she stops she get home and was telling me about it and said the announcer guy invited her up and she layed on the stage and pretended to orgasm thats all she said 

A few days later it just wasnt sitting right how would someone clearly on there bachelorette not get invited or coxed up on stage so i look through her phone i never wanted to do that but i had a gut feeling there was about a dozen videos of her getting pick up by the strippers and her pretending to suck their d*cks with clothes on and her getting dry humped by then in their underwear 

I lied and I told her that one of my coworkers friends saw her there and what happened she admitted to it  and she said i have videos if you wanna see i said sure so she showed me one video i had already seen i have never left the house when i was upset we are really good at talking stuff through but i got up and walked out drove around for a bit got a coffee then went back home she was apologizing like crazy and kept asking do you even want to marry me still i said of course but i said is that all are you lying to me any more and can you delete everything to do with that night

She deleted it all and i said are you sure that everything she assured me that was all and she asked her friends to delete videos of her doing those thing they all promised everything‚Äôs deleted so since then i have had some trust issues cant really afford to go talk to a therapist or nothing so im suppressing everything and burying it down 

She works weekends and im home alone on the weekend so i have alot of time to think and the other day i was thinking about it i bought her a new phone for Christmas so her old phone was in her drawer i shoulda left it alone and trusted her but i looked trough it and in her chats with multiple friends i found the videos my heart sank all over again and i dont know what to do i love her i know she loves me but why can she not just tell me the truth we are starting a family together but it hard to trust her ",0,1736086637.0,Marriage,6,0.4,False

Summary: The finale to this fluffy, smutty Christmas story between ballet dancer Crowley and costume designer Aziraphale.

Excerpt:

Crowley was just finishing his black coffee when Aziraphale entered the kitchen, joining him at the small table, freshly showered, but back in the previous day‚Äôs clothes. He looked so sweet, Crowley thought, hair still all tousled and wet. Smitten as Crowley was from the beginning, he could tell he was now falling hard for him. His most recent past hookups hadn‚Äôt carried any of this easy, comfortable domesticity of mornings after, instead awkwardly saying goodbyes at first light with false promises to text again, or even slipping out while the other slept.

‚ÄúTea?‚Äù He nudged the mug toward Aziraphale, empty save for the tea bag. The water was boiled, but he‚Äôd waited to pour it until Aziraphale was out of the shower, not wanting to let it steep to the point of bitterness.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúUm, I dunno if you have any plans for the rest of the day, but you‚Äôre welcome to stay a while if you want,‚Äù Crowley suggested tentatively.¬†

‚ÄúI have no plans.‚Äù Aziraphale shrugged his shoulders with a small smile. ‚ÄúPerhaps we could take a walk to admire the shops‚Äô displays along Oxford Street. They‚Äôre lovely every year but I can‚Äôt stand the crowds. All the shoppers should be out of the way by now though.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds perfect. I‚Äôll shower, then we can go.‚Äù

35 two relationships over five years, and I'm just at a crossroads. Not to toot my own horn, but I believe I'm a rather handsome guy. In the summer, I have the body of a 20-year-old collegiate athlete. And I guess I just don't know how to build relationships really. Even my relationships move fast. They weren't hook ups, but we slept together on the second date on both of them actually. I guess at 35 I was hoping to be entering my wife phase, not my fuk boi phase, but I realize I don't know how to build relationship relationships with indifferent women.

I've been texting a woman for about five days now. She seems interested she's chatty when I message her. But she's never sent me a text first. 

I guess this is the exact thing I'm getting tired of. At 35 as a man, nobody has ever supported me in my entire life. I'm getting tired of carrying everything I guess. I'm lucky enough to have met this woman in real life. It's even worse on hinge.

Now I'm doing my first re-listen to season 1 of TMP and figured I'd collect some ways OIAR is and isn't a normal Civil Service office.

These may be plot points Jon and Alex have put in, they may be creative licence, they may be characters' ignorance. Also TMP does not take part in 'our' universe, probably.

\- The IT is scarily on-point. That's about as much as I'm allowed to say on that.

\- In-sourced IT is very unusual, but then Colin has to manage the bespoke software, so whatever.

\- However, we don't actually \*sign\* the Official Secrets Act these days. We just get mandatory training every year reminding us that we're bound by it, it goes in our contracts. In effect, we have the best NDA. This is potentially a plot point - would Alice know the difference between the Official Secrets Act and some spoopy contract?

\- The characters seem to have got their contracts before starting work. Everyone I know got their actual contract several weeks after starting. \*I think this one is going to be a plot point. I think there's mystical shit in their contracts\*

\- We do indeed bring our own tea/coffee.

\- Honesty is a Civil Service Value. Tea/coffee supplies do randomly go missing.

\- We do not get an alcohol budget for leaving dos. In fact, we don't get an anything budget for leaving dos. In fact a leaving do tends to be organised by the person leaving, and is drinks after work.

\- Those desks are way bigger than they need to be. And more spaced out.

Very speculative, but I was thinking about what grade the cast would be working at. To map these onto pay, slap these grades into [https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk), go to advanced search, select the grade, apply London weighting. They'll no-doubt get a antisocial hours weighting too.

[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles/success-profiles-civil-service-behaviours](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles/success-profiles-civil-service-behaviours) are what they'd officially be hired and have their performance reviews against, but this dept is more cloak-and-dagger than that.

For basic data entry, most the cast are probably working at an Administrative Officer (AO) level.

If that's the case then Lena is probably working at a HEO/SEO level, as the direct manager of about 5 AOs.

I can not overstate how unusual it is >!for the boss of the office to be in direct contact with the Minister, at that grade.!< Of course, everything about the OIAR is weird.",14,1736086417.0,TheMagnusArchives,0,1.0,False

Communion.
We are going to use the Communion now, and here every person can please use their preferred elements for the grape juice and the bread.
Communion Scripture: Mark.14:22-24
And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
Symbolic:
Bread that is broken‚ÄîJesus‚Äô Body on the Cross for our sins.
Grape Juice‚ÄîJesus‚Äô Blood that washes us clean from our sins, for us to stand clean before God.
(Parents with little children, explain carefully to the children the seriousness of the Communion: Jesus died on the Cross for our sins, and every time that we use the Communion, we remember that there was a Cross and that Jesus died for our sins.  We use the Communion to give thanks to Jesus and to always remember that He had died for our sins.
Every parent knows how much their children do understand about the Cross Death and how to explain it to them.  I would, however, invite everyone to allow their children to make use of the Communion, even if the little child only understands that there must be prayer and that there must be an atmosphere of respect.
Scripture: Acts 3:19; Col. 3:9-10; Rom. 12:2 & 2 Cor. 3:18
Message:
The New Year has begun, and there is the feeling of newness and freshness in the air.  There is also no better time than the New Year to start anew.  Many of us are embarking on a new project; we have good intentions to start the year off right.
We also have intentions to change in our spiritual lives.  We strive to be a new person, a person who looks more like the image of God.  We are like a butterfly when we break the cocoon and spread our wings.
Where will we start with the change then?
Acts.3:19
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.
We must repent and repent.  No change can happen if we don't know where or what to change.  What better way than to repent and repent?  We need to go and see what our mistakes are, confess our mistakes, fix them, and forget about them.  After that, we will be refreshed before the Lord can stand.
We must repent and convert.  No change can happen if we don't know where or what to change.  What better way than to repent and convert.  We need to go and see what are our mistakes, confess our mistakes, fix them, and forget about them.  After that, we will be refreshed before the Lord.
Col. 3:9-10
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
The truth will set us free, and we cannot hide the truth from one another.  We speak to each other the truth and nothing but the truth.  We speak the truth and act in the truth because we have clothed ourselves with the new man.  Our new man strives to carry out the image of our Creator, and the image of our Creator represents the Truth.
Rom. 12:2
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
We must not become conformed to this world.  It's one of the harder things not to do.  It's so easy to get carried away with the things going on in the world.  It's easier to get angry and upset about our water crisis than to stay calm.  We feel much more easily discouraged when there are problems with the electricity, instead of seeing the positives in the situation.  We must always remember that our minds are renewed and that we are willing to do the will of God, regardless of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.
2 Cor. 3:18
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
When we strive more to carry out the image of God, then we will experience more of the glory of God as in a mirror image.  It's like when we get ready for the day in the morning, we look in the mirror to do our hair, shave, or put on makeup.  Then, when we feel ready to take on the world, we are not the same image as we are when we just got out of bed.  We already have a cup of coffee or two, our face is washed, our teeth are brushed, we shaved or did makeup, so we have the courage and the will to take on the world.  However, when we just fly out of bed without first brushing our teeth properly, our day just feels badly messed up and upside down.  The closer we live to God, the more we change our image and the more we take on the image of Christ.
We can approach the New Year with so much courage; we can feel much more positive about life.  Today we can look at the year ahead of us and see 365 challenges, or we can see 365 opportunities.  We are not the old people who have to live in fear and worry; we are made new; our worries are only short-lived.  Every worry is just an opportunity to see God's greatness and proclaim it to the world.
Prayer:
Father, thank you for allowing us to be so quiet with You at the beginning of the New Year.  Lord, please help us to face the New Year with its challenges and look forward to the New Year with a positive attitude.  Father, please help us to face the day with a renewed image each day.  Lord, help us also to please do all that we undertake this year for Your glory.  Jesus, please forgive us our temptations.  Please Holy Spirit, guide us so that we can resist the temptations.  Father, please make us willing to do Your Will this year.  In Jesus name, Amen.
