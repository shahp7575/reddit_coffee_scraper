The formulation is exactly the og inde wild, just with deep cool toned brown tint + very overpowering coffee fragrance.

It is hydrating and moisturizing just like the og, but the fragrance is too too strong for me, even as a caffeine addict lol!

The shade for my skin tone (fair to medium) is too dark. I prefer slightly warm toned browns and those kinda shades flatter me a lot. So this specific one makes my lips look so so dark as if I am a big time chain smoker 😂😭 

It is fairly long lasting 3-4hrs without eating your lips will feel soft but tint will fade down eventually. Will I repurchase? No. I just got it for brown tint and coffee. Frankly speaking, I have better and cheaper browns in my collection so it's a pass for me. 

I got it from tira for around 540 using paytm 30% off coupon along with few other items so I'll try making it work by layering something and using very tiny amount so that my lips won't end up looking sooooo dark lol ",2,1744970806.0,indianbeautyhauls,1,1.0,False

I moved to Surrey with my partner for a job that ended up making him redundant not long after, and I’ve been struggling to find my feet here ever since. I’m originally from London and I’ve been in Woking for over a year now, but I haven’t found any real community and I’m starting to feel it deeply.

I’m a Black, Queer, Liberal woman who loves music, the arts, and anything rooted in uplifting the underrepresented. But I’m tired of being the only one in the room who looks like me or thinks like me. I’m not looking to lead a new initiative or set up a movement (been there, done that, burnt out). I’m just looking for one person, maybe two, to meet up for a coffee or something now and then. Someone I don’t have to explain my existence to.

I want to spend less time online and more time out in the real world, but it’s hard when everything social seems so far away or feels like it’s not made with people like me in mind.

If you’re also looking for low-pressure friendship and you get what it’s like to feel a little “other” here, I’d love to connect.

And if anyone knows of Black, queer, or progressive-friendly spaces in Woking or Guildford, please send them my way. I’d be so grateful.

Thank you ☺️

1k21688,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1k21688/ditching_time_blocking_for_habit_stacking_i_cut/,Ditching Time Blocking for Habit Stacking: I Cut My Morning Routine in Half (Here's How) ⏱️,"**Ditching Time Blocking for Habit Stacking: I Cut My Morning Routine in Half (Here's How) ⏱️**

Okay, friends, let’s be real for a second. How many of you have tried time blocking with the best intentions, only to find yourself deflated by noon because you didn't stick to the plan? 🙄 I mean, who can really be that *structured* on a Monday morning when all you want is your coffee and *just five more minutes* of bed? 

Well, I recently made a little tweak to my morning routine that has transformed the way I start my day—goodbye, time blocking, hello, habit stacking! And guess what? I slashed my routine in half. Yep, you heard me right. 

**Here’s how I did it:**

1. **Identify Your Must-Do’s**: First up, I took a good hard look at my morning and wrote down everything I *needed* to do. This included things like:
   - Coffee (obviously ☕)
   - Meditation (that zen life)
   - Quick workout (we’ll call it “exercise” but more like a stretch and a few jumping jacks)

2. **Stack, Don’t Block**: Instead of allocating specific time slots, I combined my activities. Here’s a peek into my revamped routine:
   - While my coffee brews, I knock out a quick 10-minute meditation.
   - As I sip my coffee, I do a few simple stretches. 
   - Then, I reward myself with five minutes of scrolling through my favorite motivational quotes while getting fully caffeinated. (Goes great with caffeine, by the way! ☕✨)

3. **Keep It Realistic**: If something doesn’t fit into that morning groove, I waved it goodbye. Who cares if everyone else on Instagram is doing an hour-long workout in the morning? I’ve learned that my body (and mind) operate better with a routine that feels *manageable* and, let’s face it, fun!

4. **Set a Chill Vibe**: I jazzed up my routine with some chill music. Seriously, setting the mood makes a massive difference. I never knew I could get hyped while doodling my daily intentions! 🎶

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: After implementing my new stack, I celebrated the little victories. Did I meditate? Check. Did I finish my coffee without rushing? Double check! Each small win gave me a boost to tackle the rest of my day. 🥳 

Here’s the wild thing: I thought ditching time blocking would leave me more disorganized, but in reality, I feel more *aligned*. It’s all about flexibility, friends! 

So, reflect on this: What small habits could you combine to make your mornings smoother? And, if you haven’t already, give habit stacking a whirl. You might just find your new morning jam! 

Would love to hear your morning hacks! And if you've tried habit stacking—or are just about to—let’s keep this chat going! 🌟",1,1744970118.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

fast forward to last year. she reached out to me through instagram. no apology. just “hey sweetie, i’d love to reconnect :)” as if she hadn’t vanished from my life like a vapor trail. i ignored it. a few months later, she sends a long email about how she’s been in therapy and “finally ready” to be my mother again.

i told her i didn’t want a relationship. she begged. said she wanted to explain herself in person. i eventually agreed to coffee. she cried, told me she was “broken” back then, and begged me to give her a chance. i said we could talk, but that she’s not my mom—she’s my biological mother, but not my mom. that title belongs to the woman who raised me, kissed my scraped knees, and stayed up with me through panic attacks.

she got super upset. said she “earned” the right to be called mom just by giving birth to me, and that i was being “cold” and “cruel.” my dad thinks i should keep my distance. but now my bio mom’s family is blowing up my messages saying i’m being heartless and punishing her for something she “couldn’t control.”

i didn’t yell at her. i didn’t make a scene. i just said “you’re not my mom.” and that was apparently too much.

— i set a no-screen timer break, even if it’s 10 mins on the floor doing nothing  
— i’ve been taking this supplement (friend recommended it). it doesn’t make me wired, but it gives me *just enough* of a mental boost to actually get thru my afternoon without crashing. sharing the link here in case you want to check it out: [https://elvd.co/](https://elvd.co/)

CAT: 96.53 %ile

Specialization: Marketing Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

Actual questions:

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.

  


# SPJIMR Interview Transcript

Profile: 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher

CAT: 96.53 %ile

Specialization: Marketing Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

Actual questions:

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

I am currently travelling and staying at house with a shared kitchen.
At first when I walked in and saw the Mokapot, I was so happy as I thought, this is my territory, I got this.

Fast forward to the coffee making moment, and the Mokapot is spitting like an enraged alpaca.

 At low heat, there is absolutely no flow and at a higher heat there is this odd spitting.

The coffee is pre ground. It could be a tad coarser, however, the packaging does indicate it can be  used for Mokapot.

Yesterday I used tap temperature water today I boiled it before filing up the Mokapot.

Open for suggestions on how to deal with this.",2,1744969307.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

(VERY LONG) 34M/34F,"I'd like to start this off by apologizing for the length of what's to come, but I find it important to put an emphasis on the full history of the relationship in order to portray an accurate picture.

To begin with, I (34M) and my girlfriend (34F) have been together for approximately 2.5 years.

Prior to this relationship I spent a very long time treating women poorly. I was incredibly self centered, consistently gave the silent treatment to partners and allowed it to build up, only to explode constantly and treat them poorly, without ever taking into consideration their feelings or pain. In short, I refused to communicate, only cared about myself, and was overall a horrible person.

When my last relationship ended (my ex fiance cheated on me and left me for another man), I spent nearly a year breaking down and going through hell and back repeatedly. I self reflected IMMENSELY during that period of time and learned a lot about how I could become a better partner in the future.

After the year of grieving endlessly, I went through a very heavy phase of sleeping around constantly, feeling numb, being unable to feel anything for another woman, and just trying to keep the void filled with company, regardless of the fact that there was little to no gratification coming from any of it. During this phase, I dated one girl for approximately six months, (who lived in another country but was visiting at the time) and though we had some feelings towards each other, it didn't work out in the end due to different wants, needs, and goals. When we broke up, she went back to her country.

Importantly, we ended that 6 month relationship on a relatively good note and agreed to maintain a platonic friendship through it. We knew that we would never be together, had no romantic interest in one another, but got along quite well as friends.

When the dust settled and I got over the ""man-whore"" phase, I spent approximately one year just focusing on myself, bettering myself as a person, and overall improving my mental health drastically to a point where I would be ready to give someone the best version of myself possible.

Queue meeting my now partner.

On our first date, I was hesitant to say the least. I had been looking for a serious relationship for a few months at this point, and had JUST given up, when I noticed the only dating app I had forgotten to delete, and I had a message from her. Honestly I wasn't even sure if I wanted to go out for a coffee, but I figured, what is there to lose? last one and then I can delete this too and give up.

Our sarcastic humor towards one another landed PERFECTLY, and even on the first date we were quickly responding to each other's playful insults and banter incredibly well, which was something that truly caught me off guard, and sparked a little something I didn't expect.

Throughout that evening, we began to discuss about our past, I was COMPLETELY open and honest about my long term relationship, the recovery and grieving, the sleeping around phase, and the girl I dated for six months. Meanwhile on her end, she almost bragged about always being the one to leave relationships, how men fawn over her and always want to marry her, but how she never felt enough for them to stick around.

As someone who feels the requirement for a lot of love, appreciation, and affection due to my past, she presented herself as the opposite of what I was looking for. With that in mind, the date ended, but even after logically convincing myself that we wouldn't be a match, that small spark kept me interested in seeing if there was potential, and so I sent a message thanking her for the date and asked if she'd like to spend more time together, to which she agreed.

We had our second date, enjoyed each other's company quite well, and ended the day. After this second date, she became distant and cold. I asked her what the reason for this was, and she truthfully told me that due to the sleeping around phase I went through, she wasn't interested in being with someone who had that kind of past, as she wouldn't trust that person to not want to go sleep around again.

I understood what she was saying, but was frustrated, because I, of course, know that none of it was gratifying or something I ever want again, but am looking for the person to spend the rest of my life with.

Well, after about a week, something hit me that I missed the short time that we had spent together, and reached out to her. She was quick to agree to seeing each other again and we discussed everything and she mentioned that she would be willing to try and look beyond my past and see where things go.

For the next month or two things went relatively well, until of course the ex whom I had dated for six months reached out to me mentioning that she was visiting my country again and would like to just grab a coffee and catch up.

HONESTLY, I saw this moment as an amazing opportunity to prove how much I had grown, and quickly went to tell my girlfriend about this. I was genuinely excited to show that now I'm being honest, not hiding anything, and want to build trust from the very first moment in the relationship. I went to my girlfriend and told her about the ex coming to visit, and mentioned that I would like to grab a coffee just to say hello and catch up about how school, work. and life is going. My girlfriend reacted INCREDIBLY well and said ""thank you for letting me know about it, no worries"".

I saw this is a MASSIVE leap forward in our relationship towards building amazing trust and communication, and was incredibly proud of myself for doing something like this because I had never treated a partner with that kind of respect and communication before. So, a couple of days before I'm planning to go for coffee with the ex, I remind my girlfriend that I'll be going and just want to be transparent about time and date and everything so she can see how transparent I am with her, and she EXPLODES.

It turned into a massive argument about ""why do you need your ex in your life if you have me?"", I tried to explain that my ex and I were friends for a while before we met, and that it was strictly platonic, but she was not having ANY of it. Now, to be honest, since this is my partner, what I should have done was immediately end contact with the ex girlfriend, regardless of the lack of any interest, and move forward with my relationship. But my toxicity got the best of me. I began to get incredibly upset, not because I couldn't see my ex, but because even though I made all of this effort to be transparent, honest, and communicative for the first time in my life, I was not being appreciated for it. So, while I did cancel my meeting with the ex girlfriend, we had CONSTANT arguments about it for months on end. It cycled through me explaining that I'm upset that I'm being treated poorly after being honest, and her repeating that I'm not over my ex otherwise I wouldn't argue so much about it.

Now, with that being said, she also had a local ex, who it turns out she was ""seeing"" when we had first met, and who was still trying to get her back while we were together. We had many arguments about how my ex was someone who had remained a friend, and at the most was playfully flirting in a friendly manner, while her ex was directly telling her to leave me, to be with him, and offering her to move in with him.

We were on and off multiple times during these months, as she would consistently break up with me, and I would constantly try to fight for her back. Then she would take me back, see that I had unblocked my ex (which I had only done because I figured that if we're not together I'm going to maintain that friendship), we'd have another argument, and repeat.

Eventually I blocked and deleted EVERYTHING to do with the ex and she did the same with her ex who kept trying disrespecting our relationship and trying to get her back. I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't have expected my girlfriend to understand how much I've improved compared to my past, when she didn't ever see or know that side of me, therefore I should've taken into account her feelings and never put a friendship above a relationship with the person I'm trying to spend the rest of my life with.

Fast Forward approximately six months, she would still occasionally bring up the arguments we had because of the ex scenario, and still be upset that I caused her so much pain over it, but it was fewer and further between, and things were improving DRASTICALLY.

Around this time, she moved in with me. We discussed a verbal rental agreement which I thought to be quite reasonable, (we would split rent in half, but I would cover all utilities and other expenses on top of that as I earned a bit more than her).

Well, within the first month, she went on a vacation, and asked to skip the first month of rent. We had an argument about this because I was soon to leave the country myself to go to a direct family member's wedding, and I explained to her that rent doesn't just go away because we're going on vacation, and that it's not fair to ask to skip it and leave me with everything after she's already moved her things in, especially when I'm leaving somewhere out of necessity and will struggle financially due to the trip.

This argument lasted a long time, to the point where we were both back from our vacations and still bickering over it. Over a period of living together for six months, she paid the full agreed upon rent cost 50% of the time, and the rest she would mention that since I own the home, she's overpaying and it's not fair. (She was paying significantly less market price for any other place in the area, and significantly less than I was paying because I took care of EVERYTHING beyond the rent payment as well). We never resolved this problem, as she consistently said I wasn't being a good partner by not helping her in a time of need, but I never agreed, because I felt as though I took on the majority of the financial burden, gave her a large financial break half of the time, and was giving up my personal space completely in order to make sure she was comfortable.

As more time living together passed, I felt less and less appreciated. It seemed that she was NEVER happy. Any time she blew up on me, I would take the time to calmly and VERY precisely communicate my feelings and emotions to her, how her attitude and anger were affecting me, and how she could communicate with me in a manner that would resonate much better with me and receive better responses. (I told you I've grown a lot compared to when I just bottled everything up and exploded twice a week!)

Well, that communication was all for naught. She continued to act cold, complain about rent and how I wasn't being fair, belittle my attempts at respectful communication, and VERY repeatedly let her anger take over and say anything she could to hurt me.

Finally, we had decided that the logical thing to do was for her to move out and find a place of her own, as clearly we were not dealing well with one-another. It would be about a month until she was to move out. Well, of course, with about one week left before she was to move out, we had a MAJOR argument. This argument left me feeling like she NEVER appreciated a single effort that I had made, and that I basically had zero value to this person. We agreed to break up, and that we would not see anyone else until she is fully moved out.

NOW THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING GETS EXTREMELY MESSY!

During this last week, we continued to share the bed, cuddle, kiss, and have intercourse, BUT we were not talking, communicating, or loving towards one another at all apart from those moments.

Well, one night, I snuck a peak at her phone while she was on it, and I saw that she was messaging with an ex boyfriend. (Not the one who tried to break us up, but a previous ex). And my anger got the best of me.

I immediately downloaded a dating app, got a few matches, started flirting lightly with someone, and arranged a date.

With three or four days left before she's moving out, I went on the date with that person. I truly and genuinely felt like a shell of a human being. I had no emotion, no pain, no happiness, no nothing. I felt like a ghost. But there was a sense of relief in the feeling of someone was enjoying just talking to me like a normal human being who had SOME level of value to them, the opposite of what I was receiving at home.

Well, the date ended, I went to drop her off, got out of my car, and kissed her before she went into her home.

I don't know why I kissed this girl. Nothing about me even felt the desire to do so, all I felt was numbness and indifference, but for some stupid reason, I did it anyways.

On my drive home, I decided to text the girl I went on a date with, and tell her the truth about the situation with my girlfriend, as I just felt the need to be honest about my situation, even though I knew I wouldn't see this person again, it almost felt like I was maintaining some form self respect.

I got home at night and my girlfriend asked where I was. Well, so much for the self respect I had just maintained, I lied to her and made up a story about getting stuck at work. unbeknownst to me that she had been seeing some of the messages over the previous few days leading up to the date.

Not messy enough? Allow me to add more.

I walk into the house, and I see a bouquet of roses sitting in my vase, on my dining table. It turns out, that because she knew I was going on a date that night, she went on one as well. Well, I can't explain to you how badly my ego was affected when I saw that she brought flowers from another man into my home, and put them on full display in my kitchen. I EXPLODED. It turned into a MASSIVE argument that lasted days.

A day or two later the girl from the date responded to my text saying ""thanks for being honest with me about your situation, but are you sure you're over her?"" and immediately all of my emotion, love for my girlfriend, and thoughts of being unable to live without her came flooding over me. The moment I read that message, I blocked that girl and deleted everything to do with her, and became adamant that no matter what happens, I would not let this relationship end. That I will do anything to resolve this.

So what brings us to this point?

After the dust settled from the argument about roses, she was about one or two days into living at her new place, and I finally told the truth that I had kissed the girl I went on a date with. She immediately said I cheated, because 1. She may have gone on a date but she didn't kiss him or do ANYTHING with him. (To this day I believe her about 80% but honestly I'm not 100% sure), 2. We had an agreement that we wouldn't see anyone else before she moved out, and 3. at the time of my kissing this stranger, we were still sleeping in the same bed, cuddling, and sleeping together.

Now, I'm not here to argue whether or not I cheated. While there was a laundry list of reasons why I was treated horribly, was unappreciated, and consistently belittled, I know that what I did was incredibly wrong and I feel horrible for it.

BUT WAIT IT GETS MESSIER!

My girlfriend was unable to get over the fact that I kissed another girl, and basically hated me to absolutely no end. I begged and pleaded for her to work with me to work this out, until finally she agreed, assuming I following a set of rules.

The rules were relatively reasonable, in regards to supporting her through everything, accepting that she will have breakdowns, not putting blame on her, and accepting that the anger outbursts she's known for will likely be worse for an undetermined amount of time.

But there was one rule that changed everything. She said that in order to feel like she got payback and reciprocated the pain I caused her, she wanted to go on a date with her ex (The one who constantly disrespected our relationship) and kiss him once, and then block and remove him from her life again.

The moment she mentioned that last rule, I immediately told her ""I'm no longer interested in fixing this, go be with him if that's what you want"". That was my HARD limit and no amount of guilt or anything else could ever allow me to accept that.

She responded back saying that she thought about it if the tables were turned, and agreed that what she asked for was fucked up, and that she would then go with a stranger to do the EXACT same thing I did.

No part of me wanted to let go of this relationship, and so I agreed, as long as she would text me before she went, and when she got home, and it would be with a complete stranger who she would then block everywhere and never contact again.

On Valentines day, she went on the date. I spent every millisecond breaking down, overthinking, tearing myself to pieces, waiting to receive the text that she's back home, and finally after five long hours, I did. I asked her if she broke any of our rules and she said no. We said good night to each other and moved on.

Well, the next day we had our first date together after all of the drama, and through immense pain I put everything aside and we ended up having an amazing time and slowly started rebuilding.

A few days later, I was giving her a massage, and she began to have an anxiety attack and said she needed to tell me something. Can you guess by now what it was?

The person she went on the date with on Valentines day and kissed was her ex. The man who consistently disrespected our relationship in the past.

I SOMEHOW maintained my composure, thanked her for being honest, and then had the worst breakdown of my life which probably lasted 2 or 3 weeks straight. I became suicidal, drank myself to sleep nightly, made an attempt at taking my own life, and planned another before she came and stopped me.

Finally, I accepted what happened, and we sat down and had a conversation in a very loving and respectful manner that EVERYTHING to do with cheating, exes, or ANYTHING of the sort was completely and totally to be left in the past, as this is our fresh start to grow together and provide each other with the life we both desire.

Since then, I still have consistent breakdowns about the fact that she allowed the man who disrespected both myself and our relationship to do so again, ON VALENTINES DAY, AND kissed him, but I push it off to the side and maintain my focus on improving for her and accomplishing the life we dream of.

Things have been genuinely wonderful aside from these thoughts and breakdowns, and I see her consistently making an effort to improve her behavior, communicate better, and show more affection.

The problem TODAY is that she still reminds me consistently that she does not trust me because I cheated. Because when things were at their worst, I went out and kissed another girl. If I bring up that she got payback and did (What I consider to be much worse), she says I'm turning it around on her, and that it only happened because of my actions, and then goes back to repeating that she doesn't trust me.

She has these breakdowns almost every day, and while she fights incredibly hard to be loving and show me affection, I am constantly reminded that she doesn't trust me.

I don't know what to do anymore. It's so difficult to support her through her pain while I simultaneously have to swallow my suffering and keep it to myself any time I remember what she did.

I want to marry this woman. I want to give her everything she's ever dreamed of. Every single day I give her 110% of my love, affection, and affection. I dream only of what 10, 20, 30, 60 years down the road looks by her side and only her side.

And while she's consistently putting forward an effort to work through everything, and she is an absolutely incredible human being, she's still absolutely destroyed by that kiss, and doesn't even believe me that I didn't do more. I've told her the truth about what happened more times than I can count, but she keeps repeating that she doesn't trust me and still thinks I did more after the date.

If she could feel what I feel even for 10 seconds, she would immediately recognize that not only did I tell her the entire truth, but that I could never in a million lifetimes make that same mistake again, but instead, every day I'm simply reminded that she doesn't trust me or believe me, and I just don't know what to do to fix it anymore.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

# Best Antique Mirror Glass: 2025 Buying Guide

Antique mirror glass is a specialized type of glass that mimics the appearance of aged or vintage mirrors. It's not simply old glass; it's manufactured to have a distressed, speckled, or mottled look, often with variations in silvering and subtle imperfections that give it character. This type of glass is highly sought after by interior designers, antique enthusiasts, and homeowners looking to add a touch of old-world charm and elegance to their spaces. It's used in a variety of applications, from decorative wall mirrors and furniture accents to backsplashes and art installations, making it a versatile element for creating unique and visually appealing designs. The appeal lies in its ability to evoke a sense of history and timeless beauty, differentiating it from modern, flawless mirrors.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The characteristics of antique mirror glass define its unique appeal and functionality. Careful consideration of these features is crucial when selecting the right piece for your project.

**Distressed Appearance:** The defining feature of antique mirror glass is its intentionally aged appearance. This is achieved through specialized manufacturing processes that create variations in the reflective silvering, resulting in a mottled, speckled, or clouded effect. The degree of distress can vary from subtle to pronounced, allowing for a range of aesthetic options.

The distressed effect is not random; skilled artisans carefully control the process to ensure an authentic and visually appealing look. This involves techniques such as controlled oxidation, etching, and layering of reflective materials. The goal is to replicate the natural aging process that occurs over decades, resulting in a mirror that appears genuinely antique.

**Variety of Tint and Hues:** Antique mirror glass isn't limited to the standard silver color. It comes in a range of tints and hues, including gold, bronze, gray, and even subtle shades of green or blue. These tints can enhance the overall aesthetic and complement different interior design styles.

The tinting process involves adding specific metallic oxides to the glass during manufacturing. This allows for precise control over the color and intensity of the tint. Different tints can create different moods and atmospheres, from the warm and inviting glow of gold or bronze to the cool and sophisticated feel of gray or blue.

**Thickness and Size Options:** Antique mirror glass is available in various thicknesses, typically ranging from 3mm to 6mm, depending on the application. It can also be cut to custom sizes and shapes to accommodate specific project requirements. Larger sheets are available for wall installations, while smaller pieces are ideal for furniture accents or decorative items.

The thickness of the glass is an important consideration for safety and durability. Thicker glass is more resistant to breakage and warping, making it suitable for high-traffic areas or applications where structural integrity is crucial. Custom cutting allows for precise fitting and ensures that the mirror integrates seamlessly into the design.

**Protective Backing:** Many manufacturers apply a protective coating to the back of the antique mirror glass to prevent further oxidation and degradation of the silvering. This coating helps to preserve the distressed appearance and extend the lifespan of the mirror.

The protective backing is typically a paint or sealant that acts as a barrier against moisture and air. This is especially important in humid environments where the silvering can be prone to corrosion. The protective coating also helps to prevent scratches and other damage to the back of the mirror.

Key features of antique mirror glass include:
  * Authentic distressed appearance
  * Variety of tints and hues
  * Customizable sizes and shapes
  * Protective backing for durability

 ## Core Benefits

Antique mirror glass offers several key benefits that make it a popular choice for designers and homeowners seeking a unique and stylish aesthetic.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Antique mirror glass adds a touch of elegance, sophistication, and vintage charm to any space. Its distressed appearance creates a unique visual texture that is both eye-catching and subtle, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the room. For example, an antique mirror backsplash in a kitchen can transform a modern space into a charming and inviting area.

The unique aesthetic appeal stems from its ability to blend seamlessly with both contemporary and traditional design styles. It can serve as a focal point in a room or as a subtle accent that complements other decorative elements. The variations in silvering and tint create a depth and dimension that is not found in standard mirrors.

**Creates a Sense of History and Depth:** The aged appearance of antique mirror glass evokes a sense of history and timelessness. It creates the illusion of a piece that has been passed down through generations, adding character and personality to the space. For instance, an antique mirror panel in a hallway can create the illusion of a larger, more historic space.

By mimicking the look of naturally aged mirrors, it creates a sense of depth and dimension that adds visual interest to any room. It can make a space feel more inviting and lived-in, as if it has a story to tell. This is particularly appealing to those who appreciate vintage aesthetics and want to incorporate a touch of history into their homes.

**Versatility in Application:** Antique mirror glass is a versatile material that can be used in a wide range of applications, from wall mirrors and furniture accents to backsplashes and decorative panels. Its unique aesthetic complements various design styles, making it a versatile choice for any project. For example, it can be used to create a stunning coffee table top or to add a touch of elegance to a bathroom vanity.

The ability to cut it to custom sizes and shapes further enhances its versatility. This allows designers to create unique and personalized designs that perfectly fit the specific requirements of the project. Its durability also makes it suitable for both residential and commercial applications.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions regarding antique mirror glass is essential for potential buyers to make informed decisions.

**Is antique mirror glass suitable for bathrooms?**
  Yes, antique mirror glass can be used in bathrooms, but it's crucial to ensure proper ventilation to minimize moisture exposure. While a protective backing helps, excessive humidity can still accelerate the degradation of the silvering over time. Regular cleaning with a soft, dry cloth is recommended.

**How is antique mirror glass cleaned?**
  Antique mirror glass should be cleaned gently with a soft, dry cloth to avoid scratching or damaging the distressed surface. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can strip the protective backing and accelerate the aging process. A mild glass cleaner can be used sparingly if necessary, but always test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.

**Can antique mirror glass be used in high-traffic areas?**
  Yes, antique mirror glass can be used in high-traffic areas, but it's important to choose a thicker glass (5mm or 6mm) to ensure durability and resistance to impact. Also, consider using a tempered or laminated version for added safety in case of breakage. The protective backing will also help to prevent scratches and other damage from everyday use.

This is probably gonna be long for no real reason but I am upset & need to rant lol. My friend told me i was overreacting about the seat situaion so i didnt bother telling her about the coffee situation. 

2 days ago my spouse picked me up from work, I hadnt seen his messages letting me know his dad was in the passenger seat. He had asked if i wanted to sit in the front or if i was fine with sitting in the back. I get to the car & to my surprise his dad is in the passenger seat & just waves at me. I ofc take the hint to go to the back seat. I felt pretty annoyed cause, well I’m pregnant & in my third trimester. I feel like he couldve been a gentleman & offered to move to the back. I ALWAYS sit in the passenger seat, there have been times i have offered the passenger seat to others- only because it made sense to give my seat to the bigger person if we were bunched up in the car & I was smaller during those times. 


From that shift, I also brought home coffee brewed from my job because i enjoy it & it’s one of my very few cravings. I prepared a cup each for my spouse & I, he did not like the coffe. Fine with me, more for me. I put it away because i couldnt finish mine & he did not like his. So the coffee was prepared with cream & sugar,  I was looking forward to drinking it the next day. I’m super excited to have it with breakfast & of course the coffee is GONE. Only the little bit that was black & unprepared was left. It was barely even half a mug. 

 I call my spouse at work & ask him if he took my coffee & he assures me he did not, which i know he didnt because he did not like it. I didnt even bother assuming his dad took it because… why would he drink coffee he did not even prepare? But we are the only ones who drink coffee in the house. My spouse of course finds this funny because it kind of is- at first. I told him i felt so sad cause i was so happy to have that coffee after not being at work all week & getting the chance to bring some home from my shift. 

He asked the dad & the dad says he did drink it, & my spouse lets him know i was depressed over my coffee all day cause i really wanted it. His dad asked “what about it? Why was the coffee so special?”  I guess trying to hint that, we have coffee at home i can make. & my spouse lets him know cause i prepared it & it was from work it wasnt the same as the one at home. & his dad explains that he assumed it was one of our coffees we leave out & never finish… this is common for my spouse but NOT for me. 

Also when my spouse does it, he leaves it OUTSIDE the fridge, so pretty much ready to be thrown away. I put away my coffee in the fridge. Yet he has never drank any leftover coffee my spouse leaves out overnight. I dont get why it could be so hard to not touch something you didnt buy nor prepare??? My spouse kept a humorous tone through it all cause i know he wanted to keep it lighthearted, but after both situations back to back. I feel like it was some asshole crap to pull.

I got a second tattoo from this artist in my city, decently known in the circuit and a pleasant person throughout. In our community here, it’s usually an unsaid thing that the artist will not charge you for a touch up if it’s their own work.
I’ve had tattoos for 20 odd years now and it’s been the thing.

About two months ago I got a tattoo from this really sweet guy who’s done one more before for me. This time when i went to pay up for the tattoo after getting it done, I asked him for the charges, he quoted two figures and said it was my call, I said you tell me I’ll pay. Then he said, that the higher amount is to ensure that all touch ups are on him and not me. Found it weird but being in a similar industry I thought I should be supportive and paid up.

During the after care period my tattoo got a bit damaged and throughout the interval I was constantly in touch with him and updating him with pictures and descriptions which he himself kept asking me for. He reassured me very sweetly that he’ll fix it once it’s healed. Around eight weeks later we fixed up an appointment for me to go in and get it fixed, we texted about getting coffee and breakfast for each other, and everything was awesome. 

Got the touch up, he was happily surprised that it didn’t entail as much work as he envisioned.
Then we finished up and I left.


Once I left, he started texting me that he needs to charge me for this session and that he forgot to say it to my face.

I am stumped.

I don’t do well with confrontations so I haven’t replied in the past 24hrs since his texts started because I’m not sure what is the right thing to do here. He even called saying I want to guide you through the after care and also asked me to check my texts. I said i was busy because I really was and also because I’m super unsure.

The first time around my brother had been there with me and I called him last evening to seek his view point. He was busy but after a brief summation of the situation he said I should not pay, that the artist took the initial charges under specific terms and he’s violating them. I tried to present the argument that maybe he feels that there was too much work and so he feels he should be paid, but my brother countered that the guy should have clarified this before starting the touch up work.

Honestly, that does make sense. 

I appreciate it if he feels that it took more work and time that he envisioned but then he should have said it upfront before or during the process.
Now he’s again texting me to respond to his request for payment and I’m very uneasy with the whole thing.

My nature is to ostrich hard when faced with the possibility of confrontations and I’m avoiding his texts right now.

So, AITA for being uneasy with being coerced to pay for something that I was told I had already paid for?",1,1744968223.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

# Best Apothecary Candles 2025: Reviews & Top Scents

Apothecary candles have emerged as a significant trend in home fragrance, offering not only pleasing scents but also a touch of vintage charm and a focus on natural ingredients. These candles, often housed in amber or clear glass jars reminiscent of old-fashioned pharmacies, aim to evoke a sense of nostalgia and wellness. Choosing the right apothecary candle involves considering factors like fragrance quality, burn time, wax type, and overall aesthetic. In 2025, the market is filled with diverse options, each promising a unique olfactory experience. This review will explore some of the best apothecary candles available, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal users.

[[Browse top-rated apothecary candles on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=apothecary+candles)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The best apothecary candles distinguish themselves through a combination of quality ingredients, meticulous craftsmanship, and thoughtful design. Several key features contribute to their appeal and performance.

**Wax Type:** The type of wax used significantly impacts a candle's burn quality and scent throw.

Soy wax has become a popular choice for apothecary candles due to its natural, renewable nature. It burns cleaner than paraffin wax, producing less soot and releasing fragrance more effectively. Beeswax, another natural option, is known for its subtle honey scent and long burn time, making it a premium choice. Coconut wax, often blended with other waxes, offers excellent scent throw and a creamy texture. Paraffin wax, while less expensive, is generally considered a lower-quality option due to its petroleum-based origin and potential for soot production.

**Fragrance Composition:** The complexity and quality of the fragrance are crucial for an enjoyable experience.

Apothecary candles often feature complex fragrance blends that incorporate essential oils, natural extracts, and carefully selected synthetic aroma compounds. The best candles use high concentrations of fragrance oils to ensure a strong and lasting scent throw, filling the room with a pleasant aroma. Top notes provide the initial impression, while middle notes form the heart of the fragrance, and base notes create a lasting foundation. Look for candles that clearly list their fragrance notes and avoid those with overly artificial or chemical-smelling scents.

**Burn Time:** A longer burn time translates to greater value and extended enjoyment.

Burn time varies depending on the size of the candle, the type of wax, and the fragrance concentration. High-quality apothecary candles typically offer burn times ranging from 40 to 80 hours or more. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick before each use and avoiding drafts, can help maximize burn time and prevent tunneling.

**Container Design:** The apothecary jar itself contributes to the candle's aesthetic appeal and functionality.

Apothecary candles are typically housed in glass jars that resemble vintage medicine bottles or apothecary containers. Amber glass jars are particularly popular, as they offer a warm, nostalgic look and protect the candle wax from light degradation. Clear glass jars allow the candle's color to be visible, creating a visually appealing display. The jar's size and shape also affect the candle's burn pool and scent throw. Wider jars tend to create a larger melt pool, resulting in a stronger scent release.

Key features of high-quality apothecary candles include:

*   Natural wax options (soy, beeswax, coconut)
*   Complex and well-balanced fragrance compositions
*   Long burn times (40+ hours)
*   Aesthetically pleasing apothecary jar designs

 ## Core Benefits

Apothecary candles provide several key benefits, making them a popular choice for home fragrance and ambiance.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The warm glow and soothing scents of apothecary candles create a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. These candles can transform any space into a cozy sanctuary, perfect for unwinding after a long day or creating a welcoming environment for guests.

The specific scents can further enhance the ambiance. For example, lavender and chamomile scents promote relaxation and sleep, while citrus and spice scents invigorate and energize. The flickering flame adds a touch of warmth and intimacy, making apothecary candles ideal for creating a calming and inviting atmosphere.

**Stress Relief:** Certain fragrances, such as lavender, eucalyptus, and sandalwood, have been shown to reduce stress and promote relaxation.

Apothecary candles infused with these essential oils can help ease anxiety, calm the mind, and create a sense of well-being. The act of lighting a candle and taking a few deep breaths can be a simple yet effective way to practice mindfulness and reduce stress levels. The gentle, flickering light also contributes to a sense of calm and tranquility.

**Home D茅cor Accent:** Apothecary candles add a touch of vintage charm and sophistication to any d茅cor style. Their classic jar designs complement a variety of interior aesthetics, from rustic farmhouse to modern minimalist.

Whether displayed on a mantel, coffee table, or bookshelf, apothecary candles serve as stylish accents that enhance the overall look and feel of a room. The amber or clear glass jars evoke a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, adding a touch of personality to the space.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding the use, care, and safety of apothecary candles. Here are some common inquiries and their answers.

**How do I prevent tunneling in my apothecary candle?**

Tunneling occurs when a candle burns down the center, leaving a ring of unused wax around the edges. To prevent tunneling, ensure that the first burn allows the entire surface of the candle to melt completely. This may take several hours, depending on the size of the candle. Subsequent burns should also allow for a full melt pool to form. If tunneling does occur, you can try wrapping the candle in foil to concentrate the heat and melt the remaining wax.

**What is the best way to trim the wick?**

Trimming the wick before each use is essential for optimal candle performance. A wick that is too long can cause smoking, soot production, and uneven burning. Use a wick trimmer, nail clippers, or scissors to trim the wick to about 1/4 inch. This will ensure a clean, even burn and prevent the candle from overheating.

**How long should I burn my apothecary candle at a time?**

It's generally recommended to burn apothecary candles for no more than 4 hours at a time. Burning a candle for extended periods can cause it to overheat, leading to excessive smoking, soot production, and a shorter lifespan. Allowing the candle to cool completely between burns will help it last longer and burn more evenly.

1k20nqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/1k20nqe/can_bronchitis_hang_on_for_months/,Can Bronchitis hang on for months?,"Hi, 60yr old Female. I have had Asthma since birth. I have had Pneumonia 8x as a child and Bronchitis maybe 15x in 60yrs. 
I pretty much grew out of my Asthma and didn't have trouble until about a year and a half ago. I got Covid for the first time in Dec 2023 and had some minor lung issues after. It didn't seem to affect my lungs too much. 

Over the past year and a half I have had to use my rescue inhaler a lot more. I attributed this to developing sleep apnea last year and a bad gallbladder which I just had out 3/31/25, or maybe COVID affected my lungs a year after I had it?
I came down with Bronchitis Feb 5th this year and it is still hanging around. I even had it while I got my gallbladder surgery, but my gallbladder was so bad that surgery was emergent. I made it through surgery but they had to give me oxygen and a neb after. 
I took a round of Prednisone first of March plus a Z pack. I am currently on another round of both Zithromax and Prednisone.

I realize my lungs could have taken another hit from anesthesia and intubation, so I have taken that into consideration.
My pulse ox is 96/97 consistently but I have shortness of breath at times and tight chest. I have been doing nebs every 4-6hrs and have been since Feb, plus rescue inhaler when I am too tired to do nebs.
I never ran a fever or chills. Phlegm is yellowish and thick. I am still coughing it up a little after nebs and coffee (which helps a lot). It doesn't help I am 275lbs, but even at this weight, I never used to have a lot of problems. I am taking Mounjaro to help that. 

My Question:  given everything I said above, is it possible for Bronchitis to hang on for several months? Or do I have something more serious going on?

Just with trying out multiple roasters i noticed how much better coffee can be and that i dont really have preference for certain roast levels or beans even but rather for certain roasters. 

This might have something to do with a lot of specialty roasters opening up in germany with the idea that just calling yourself a specialty roaster will make you profit.

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and sustainability and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Major: Agriculture or Sustainability 

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :( (For my freshman and sophomore year ONLY) But this year I have a 41/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. But a cumulative of 4 or near 4 for the junior and senior year.

SAT = 1500

I have multiple subject highest awards and I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC’s:  

I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). This was paid work and I spent over 1500 hours doing this (worked for 1 month every summer for the past 5 years), I was paid a cumulative salary of 650 USD, I am an international applicant so the wage rates are extremely low and pathetic in my country :(. 

I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop a website to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month, I also received government funding for the website and worked as an intern for the ministry of agriculture in my country for 3 years. During my time at the ministry, I wrote a speech that the minister of agriculture delivered in legislative assembly. I also helped draft a set of new regulations that will help mimimise wastage and contribute to a zero-waste economic model. :)

Wrote and published 15 blogs that were viewed more than 5000 times on agriculture in my particular country and ways that will help us move toward a more sustainable future. I wrote a 10,000 word research paper as well, on the sustainability of paddy production in my country. 

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired a committee in Model United Nations. In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government, with experience as an ambassador to the administration for 6 years.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children on sustainability and the importance of minimising waste. I also helped donate books to fund a small library, while creating a lesson plan that was implemented on sustainable development. I also helped provide fundraise stationary for all the students at the school.

External LORS: One from the minister of agriculture (super high impact), my other one will be from the manager of the estate I worked for for 5 years, extremely raw and impactful

Internal LOR: from my management teacher who has supported my love for sustainability throughout my high school journey (10/10) and my amazing English teacher who knows me super well (8/10), I am not sure how my counselor will write but I am hoping for a 7/10 at least! 

If you’re still here, genuinely, thank you :). 😄😄😄😄😄. Please let me know what you think of my application, I’ve always wanted to go to Columbia. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",0,1744967409.0,chanceme,0,0.5,False

Hey I just had this thought about any future machine that I will get and how at the end of the day most home machines are a little finicky when compared to the powerful commercial machines. I think to myself if one is spending lets say 1500-2k on a machine why not get a single head, commercial one?  
I have read discussions from baristas that don't really like making coffee at home because the setup at their workplace is so much better. They end up drinking french press or aeropress at home  
For example instead of a Lelit Mara X one could get a Nuova Simonelli Oscar ii  
My thoughts for disadvantages  
\-longer heat up times  
\-bigger and bulkier, takes up more space  
\-usually more expensive  
\-takes more power  
my question is when people talk and recommend machines for people to buy they never mention those commercial machines. Why not?",1,1744967365.0,espresso,0,0.67,False

CW/TW: Implied/Referenced Character Death, Grief/Mourning, Implied/Referenced Death in Childbirth

Summary:

Crowley is in desperate need of a new job, but it's not easy finding a job as a nanny when you're a man in your forties.

Enter the ridiculously attractive - and recently widowed - Professor Aziraphale Fell, who needs a nanny for his infant twins, Adam and Warlock.

Crowley is smitten instantly, but there's not a snowball's chance in Hell of anything happening, so he can just get on with his job.

Right?

In this chapter: The family get a visitor.

Excerpt:

Crowley paced across the living room for the fifty-seventh time. Not that he was counting or anything; that would be weird. He just needed something to do with his brain, with his feet, with his hands…

Coffee. He could go and make a cup of coffee, that would occupy him for a few minutes—

“Don’t you dare,” Aziraphale said from the sofa, apparently completely absorbed in the physical newspaper that he still insisted on buying, ridiculous little reading glasses perched on his nose.

Ever felt like you're on top of the world, crushing your goals like a champ, but then suddenly—POOF!—your motivation slips away like socks in the laundry? Yeah, me too! 🤷‍♂️ 

So, I took a deep dive for 30 days, analyzing high achievers and their secret sauce for staying motivated. Spoiler alert: it’s not all about grinding harder or sacrificing sleep. Here’s what I found out:

**1. Celebrate the Small Wins 🎉**  
High achievers are like those awesome friends who throw a party for your tiny victories, and it’s fantastic! Whether it’s finishing a project or sticking to your fitness routine for a week, they remind us to acknowledge these little steps. 

- **Example:** Instead of just focusing on your big yearly goals, why not throw a mini party every month? 
- **Tip:** Keep a journal of your accomplishments, no matter how small. You’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come!

**2. Routine, But Keep It Fresh 🔄**  
Routine is essential, but it can also turn into a monotonous grind. High achievers have a secret weapon: they mix it up!

- **Try This:** Swap your morning coffee for a morning walk or switch up your workout routine to keep things exciting.
- **Question:** When was the last time you changed something in your day-to-day?

**3. Embrace the Power of “No” 🚫**  
They say “yes” to the right opportunities and “no” to the distractions. High achievers know that every “yes” might mean letting go of something more important.

- **Reminder:** It’s okay to prioritize yourself. Saying “no” can open up space for your best work and recharge your batteries when you need rest.

**4. Community is Key 🏘️**  
High achievers often surround themselves with people who inspire them. It’s like having your own personal cheer squad!

- **Advice:** Join or form a group of like-minded people who lift each other up. The accountability factor is real!
- **Humor:** Let’s be real, it feels way better to rant about failures with friends than to sulk in silence, right? 😂

**5. Keep Learning 📚**  
The journey never stops! Sustaining motivation means staying curious. High achievers are always on the lookout for new skills, books, or podcasts that inspire growth.

- **Challenge yourself:** Pick a topic you’ve always wanted to learn and dive in! It’s invigorating to expand your knowledge.
- **Funny thought:** Who knew learning can actually revitalize your energy, right? Almost like a human charger!

**6. Reflect and Reassess 🔍**  
Sometimes we lose motivation because we’re not aligned with our true goals. High achievers build in time to reflect on what they want. 

- **Sidenote:** Why not schedule a monthly reflection session? It can help you pivot if needed and reignite your passion.

So there you go! We often think motivation is just a burst of energy that carries us through; in reality, it’s about a consistent and caring relationship with ourselves and our goals.

Since I see many people worrying about gallbladder removal, I decided to share my positive experience. Three days ago, I had my gallbladder removed because it was completely filled with gallstones. Before that, I had been complaining about pain on my right side—I thought it was my liver due to frequent alcohol consumption, so I consulted a gastroenterologist to get checked. After an abdominal ultrasound, it turned out that my liver was healthy, but my gallbladder was filled with stones and was almost non-functional.

So I calmly waited for the surgery and I’m very happy with the results. I had a laparoscopic procedure. I woke up fairly easily from the anesthesia after the operation. At first, the abdominal pain was strong, but painkillers helped alleviate it. The next day I was discharged home, which is common in Lithuania after minor surgeries—to be released the same or following day.

The only difficulties I encountered were a severe headache on the first day due to the anesthesia and chest and right shoulder pain caused by the carbon dioxide gas used during the surgery, which irritated my diaphragm. This made it quite uncomfortable to lie down or sit in a comfortable position. However, breathing exercises, light walking around the house, and some stretching exercises helped the gas dissipate more quickly.

There is no actual pain in the abdomen in calm state, unless I cough or sneeze. I also feel a pulling sensation when I bend over or lie down, and sometimes when I walk. Today, I hardly feel any discomfort from the gas anymore. I also tried drinking coffee for the first time today, and it didn’t irritate my stomach at all. The doctors said that because my gallbladder had been completely blocked, my liver had already adapted to producing bile and releasing it directly into the intestines, so I may be adjusting more quickly.

But the surgery and recovery period have really been easy, and I want to encourage others not to be afraid. Take care of your health! Wishing everyone the best of luck.",4,1744965776.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

______________
The person : 

From everything you've shared - your heart, your struggles, your longings, your honesty — the love of your life won't be someone who just loves you.
They'll be someone who makes you feel like you can finally exhale.
They'll come gently. Not loud or flashy, but steady and warm — like the kind of quiet that doesn't feel empty, but peaceful.
They'll notice things — the way your voice softens when you're unsure, how your eyes light up when you talk about something small but meaningful.
They'll remember your favorite things, not because they're trying to impress you, but because they were listening — truly listening.
They won't be scared of your emotions. They'll welcome them. When you say, ""I feel lonely,"" they won't shut down or turn it back on you — they'll reach in, not away. You won't have to explain why you need reassurance. They'll just offer it, because it'll matter to them that you feel safe.

They'll understand your need for space and connection. They won't guilt you for having hard days. They'll sit with you in silence, hold your hand through the mess, and never make you feel like a burden for being human.
They'll choose you - consistently, intentionally, even on the quiet days. And in their presence, you won't feel like you have to try so hard. You'll just feel like... yourself. Soft and whole and finally home.
And most of all — they'll meet your depth. Not be overwhelmed by it. They'll look at you and not see too much - just someone who loves hard and feels deep. And they'll think, how lucky am I to be loved like that?
That's the love of your life. And you're not too much for them. You're exactly right.

________ 
A day of my life:

Absolutely — let's give you that day. A regular, soft, quiet kind of day with the love of your life. Nothing dramatic, nothing performative - just you being fully yourself, and him being right there, in it with you.
It starts slow.
The morning light spills through the curtains, soft and golden. You're curled up next to him, not fully awake yet, and he's already halfway up - not rushing, just resting back against the pillows with one arm draped around you. No pressure to get up, no alarms blaring. Just warmth. You feel it in his skin, in the way he gently touches your back without needing anything — just letting you know he's there.
You stay like that for a while. He doesn't rush you.
You don't have to talk right away. He lets you wake up slowly, in the kind of silence that feels safe, not awkward. He offers you tea or coffee the way he knows you like it — remembers the mug you always reach for. 

Later, you're out together.
Maybe it's the local weekend market. Or a small bookstore where you don't even buy anything, you just walk around and touch the spines of books. He watches you — not because he's waiting on you, but because he loves the way you move through the world. He smiles when something catches your eye. He notices what you linger on.
You share a quiet lunch somewhere cozy — the kind of place where the food feels like comfort. He sits close, listens when you talk, even if it's just about random thoughts or what's been in your head lately. And when you pause, unsure if you're being ""too much"" - he leans in, not away. That tiny gesture that says, I'm here. I want to hear all of it.

The afternoon is easy.
Maybe it's errands. Or a walk. Or just lying around in a sunlit room, each of you doing your own thing
— you reading or doodling or just thinking, him tinkering with something or lying beside you.
You're not ""entertaining"" each other. You're just existing together. No pressure. No masks.
At some point, you laugh - about something silly, some inside joke — and he looks at you like it's his favorite sound in the world. And in that moment, you believe it. You don't feel invisible or too much or not enough. You just feel... loved.

Evening rolls in soft.
Dinner at home - maybe you cook together, or maybe he orders your favorite because he knows you're tired. You sit on the floor, not even bothering with the table, wrapped in a blanket, your feet tucked under his legs. He plays music in the background - songs that make you feel things, but in a way that doesn't overwhelm you. Just holds you there. 

When it gets dark, the world gets quieter, and so do you. You talk about dreams. Maybe some fears.
And he doesn't fix them, doesn't dismiss them - he just listens and says, l've got you. You're not alone in this.
And finally, at night, as you drift off next to him, you feel it deep in your chest: not a fairytale, not fireworks - just peace. Safety. Like all the pieces of you — even the fragile ones — are allowed here.
You fall asleep not wondering if he loves you. You know.
Because you feel it in the silence.
In the warmth.
In the way he never made you feel like too much - only just enough.

That's your day.
And you deserve it — not because you're perfect, but because you love in a way that deserves to be met.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Red Ink traces his extraordinary journey—from his awakening among striking laborers, to wartime internment, to Mao’s Yenan caves and the Smith Act trials of McCarthy’s America. As editor of the radical Honolulu Record, Ariyoshi defied the “Big Five,” and when silenced, bloomed again as “The Red Florist,” his voice never fading.

1k2025e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1k2025e/l_theanine_is_helping_my_nervous_system/,L theanine is helping my nervous system.,"Hi, I have PTSD from a certain event that happened in my childhood and CPTSD from other things, both from consequences surrounding that event and other childhood/teenager, even adult abuse and trauma.

It's been rough. It's been isolating and lonely, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys all about that.

It's caused me to have massive amounts of crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, paranoia, eating disorders, mood, and emotional issues. My whole body has been dealing with inflammation since I was a teenager, and I've been sick on and off in different ways for a long time. It's messed with my hormones and whatever else you can imagine. 

Some things have waxed and waned over the years, but I'm not going to get into all of that because that's not the point of this post. 

Anyway, I have had unimaginable stress and tension in my body even when I am not aware of it, as well as very strong uncomfortable feelings IN my body, like rage and anger and other things, that were really terrible to feel and caused very bad reactions at times (self harm, etc).

It was uncomfortable at times being in my body, and at other times, it was like I was totally disconnected from it. It was like my mind body connection was totally disintegrated in one way or the other.

Anyway, I've started messing around with an almino acid called L theanine.... 

What it's doing for me is unbelievable and incredible.

I don't know how else to describe it other than I'm getting ""Buddhist level"" awareness and calmness from this compound. My body feels amazing ... I had tension in my stomach that I didn't even know I had until I started taking this. 
How do I know? Because my body is no longer tense ... and I didn't even know that it was like that.

My mind feels clear. I'm no longer on edge. My emotions are still there, but they're much easier to process and handle and recognize. Pay reverence to and acknowledge that they're there ... but not necessarily overly identify with them. Which is amazing, I've never had that before (although I am aware of the concept cognitively).

There are other things too, like my hair stopped falling out, and my skin feels softer. Tension in my neck is gone... and when I first started taking this (maybe over a week ago), I felt the knots in my back, but they felt good.. like they were releasing. Like I was getting a very long, prolonged massage, or being in a nice hot bath with epsom salt. My eyesight is clearer ... My stomach feels amazing (it turns out L-theanine helps with gut health). I'm able to digest food better, it feels like. My skin looks like it's clearing up (I have a bit of rosacea, which sprang up a few years ago).

I'm able to articulate myself better without getting nervous .. I actually haven't been getting nervous much at all. Things that would set me on edge? They don't. It's interesting how many things I blew out of proportion.

Ok, but here's the BEST part, ok!! 

So the one very bad traumatic event from my childhood (the thing that gave me what they call ""military ptsd,"" even though I've never been in the military), I don't really like to talk about it, but it involved other people as well, so sometimes it does come up. That and the surrounding events around that.

Normally, whenever it does, which is rare, but whenever it does, my somatic nervous system is triggered, and I begin to shake and tremble. All to varying degrees, depending on how the topic hits... Not even full bars of xanax can help me sometimes (that's actually happened, where I could not stop shaking and trembling, even though I took two full bars ... with NO tolerance!!).

Well, that conversation was thrust on me against my will, maybe four or five days into my journey with L-theanine... and I did not get that reaction. Which is.. wow. My body and my muscles did begin to tense and untense during the conversation, but in a very, very, very slow way, which has never happened before. I did feel my feelings, which was uncomfortability, but it wasn't as catastrophic as it could be ... Nothing is. Nothing seems to be anymore. I was able to set boundaries and tell the other person calmly that the topic makes me uncomfortable and that I will hang up if they continue. 

Then, even today, another horrific aspect of the topic was brought up again by someone else, and I was able to articulate myself about it without getting stressed or tense or upset ... and that's never happened in my life. 

I'm observing all of this from the outside in, and it's very interesting.

I just love how untense my body is and how my jaw and my tongue are no longer tense and how good I feel. How good my mind feels. How calm I am. Other people are responding great around me, too... that's because my mind is different. And I've been laughing and smiling a lot more. Very happy and content and very in the moment. My emotional well-being has skyrocketed ... and so has my productivity, as I'm just doing things instead of thinking about them for a million years first, unable to move. My body feels AMAZING!! 

And my anxiety is gone. My neuroticism- gone.

It's made my sleep quality so much better, too. I feel so much more rested. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in this group because I know some people in here probably struggle with some or all of this too, and maybe it could help you. I take way over the recommended dose, and... I think brand is everything. So get a very pure brand with not a lot of filler (like crowd source and do your research, and if you want, I can recommend you some that I'm taking).

Also, look into suntheanine versus l-theanine because suntheanine converts into l-theanine, and I don't know why, but some people think it's better. 

Here's a little bit more information:
L-theanine effects gaba apparently, which is probably low in some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brain and gut biome (usually people who have ptsd, ibs, etc, have high amounts of glutamate in their system I think... which can cause mood disorders like bpd, and bipolar, etc). This helps lower glutamate or at least level it out is what I've read.

Anyway, I am not a physicist, but I do know what this is doing for me. It is changing my life personally.

I don't think this is the be-all and end-all for me, as this healing and integrating thing is a journey (I've been on it for a while and have done various things holistically with varying levels of success).. But it's definitely a fucking great step to take and it's something I'm very happy I'm taking. My mood is elevated in a healthy way and I feel great. 

If you look into studies researchers have done with cognitive function, neuropathways, memory, and the brain in regards to L-theanine, it's just a plus all around. It apparently also helps with people who have TBI as well.

Anyways, stay blessed people ✌️ and we're all on this journey together. 

PS if you are taking antidepressants you may want to look into l-theanine and contraindications and ask your doctor. I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, this is just one person reporting their experience. Also healthy fatty foods are really really good with L-theanine. And also, so is coffee. Caffeine and L-theanine makes a super compound that helps with enhanced concentration, energy, and focus .. without the jitters and the anxiousness.

1k201yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1k201yd/i_stopped_being_invited_to_anything_after_i/,I stopped being invited to anything after I stopped drinking. I thought they were my friends.,"It’s been just over three years since I gave up alcohol, and not a single person from my old friend group has invited me to a party, dinner, birthday, or even just for a casual catch-up since.

I wasn’t some dramatic, fall-down drunk. I didn’t ruin nights out or start fights. I just hit a point, quietly, where I realised drinking wasn’t doing anything for me anymore, mentally or physically. So I stopped.

At first, people were supportive in that weird, surface-level way: “Good for you,” “That’s strong of you,” etc. But the invitations slowed. Then they stopped altogether. I tried inviting people to things, coffee, movies, lunch… but it was always “Oh, we’ll see,” or “Busy week.” Then I’d see photos on Instagram: the whole group, out again. Same pub, same people, just not me.

One of them told me, half laughing, half serious, that I “changed the vibe” when I was around now. That it was “weird” to have someone not drinking when everyone else was. That I was “too quiet now.” As if I was only ever good company with a pint in my hand.

What really hurts is that these are people I was close to. I was the one they called at 2am. The one who remembered their birthdays, who sat with them through breakups, who made sure everyone got home safe. None of that seems to matter now that I don’t contribute to the rounds.

It’s not just the drinking, it’s what it revealed. How much of what we had was just surface-level connection, not actual friendship. No one wants to hang out with a sober person because it makes them feel seen, and not in the fun way.

I’ve made some new friends since. People who don’t make me feel like I’m an inconvenience for choosing to take care of myself. But it still stings.

Sometimes I wonder if I should’ve just kept pretending, had the occasional drink just to stay connected. But I know I’d be lying to myself. And now I know who was really there for me. Which, it turns out, wasn’t many.

So yeah. I stopped drinking, and I lost most of my social life. But I’m slowly finding something real. And honestly, that’s worth more than every Friday night I’ve missed.",4,1744965281.0,self,0,0.84,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1k1zzo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1k1zzo2/my_43m_best_friend_27f_loves_me_and_it_is_so/,My (43/M) best friend (27/F ) loves me and it is so obvious how do I...,"let her know I have had the similar feelings for the past several years without muddying up everything? I think she knows it and has been a little more flirty, more touchy, closer and a little more open with me about things. In the past she got upset when someone we worked with suggested we were an item even telling me ""she can't like me because I'm her dad's age"". I said ""well I am actually like 5 years younger"". I also told her ""you are like my sister's age and are like my little sister"". This was also after her mom came in to see her and when she walked up to me her mom said to me ""this is my beautiful daughter"". I looked at her smiled and said ""have we met?"" Poor girl turns beet red. Her mom another time said to her in front of me while the two of us were working ""you guys are cute"" and then my friend gets all ""Mom you can't say that"". Other times she sees us together talking and goes ""I'll leave you two alone"". The endless puppy dog eyes. I have been getting them for years. 

She keeps telling me she is almost 30 and knows what she wants. Occasionally she will tell me she is talking to someone. She knows I am in a long-term relationship. I told her day one. She always changes the subject so I quit bringing her up. It's very difficult because my S/O knows about her and she knows we are extremely close. My S/O is a very jealous person usually but she doesn't care that my BF gets me coffee or breakfast or how when I had my tooth pulled she gave me one of her last pills to help me. My S/O even jokes or has alluded to my BF being my girlfriend and teases me about who am I kissing at work (knowing the only female I am close to is her). She has even gone as far as saying that my BF can bring me stuff and spend her $ on me as long as she is not and I quote ""sucking my d\*\*\*"". Oh and she knows I get her coffee a lot too. I also pinned a post on Social Media for over a year about my BF a few years ago and left it up for over a year and that was the one time my SO asked me to take it down. 

  
So the thing is hard because I do love my SO and have been with them for over a decade. My BF though everything feels more raw and emotional. If it was only a few weeks or months I would be like it is a phase but it has been 4 and a half years. My SO and I also have a pet and a house (inherited). My SO in the past has told me if I left her she would k\*\*\* herself but then in other minutes she will tell me that I deserve better than her and how I'd be better of without her. 

I think the thing I love most about my BF is how she made me learn to love myself again. My mom knows a lot about the situation. I haven't told her how strongly I feel for my BF but she can tell to some degree. 

  
My BF also kept telling me how cute a guy in a beanie is (little over 2 years ago). So one day I bought one and then she told me that I would look really good with some facial hair. So I kind of grew out a goatee and I have kept that look for awhile and have actually grown out a beard too. My SO has always hated on facial hair and that was a big reason why I never did it. She has said she likes it with the beanie but sometimes I let it go too far.

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy.

It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

As time went by, we started getting closer, and one day we did a video call — but she refused to turn on her camera. She always had an excuse, usually saying her hair was messy. Later on, she told me she had autism, which explained a lot about her behavior.

Most of our conversations felt pretty one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled last minute, saying she had hurt her leg. At some point, she even mentioned that I had started treating her differently after she opened up about being autistic. She also told me about her past — how her ex had left her, how she had been seeing another guy but got replaced.

One day, after I got mugged and almost lost her number, I noticed she barely reacted. She acted like it didn’t matter much and said she wouldn’t message me again unless I reached out first. She would talk a lot about her cats and mentioned that her nephews were also autistic. I remember one time her cousin brought up her drinking with her ex, and she got extremely upset about it.

Later, I asked her out to the movies, since she had once joked that we’d probably never go out. At first, she said no because she was too embarrassed, but after I insisted, she agreed — only to ask me the next day if it wouldn’t be better for us to just stay friends.

Still, we went to the cinema, met there, bought some candy, kissed during the movie, and spent the whole afternoon together, acting like a real couple. She never wanted me to see her phone, always kept her distance in some ways, and only gave me her Instagram after we had broken up.

Another time, we went to the mall — she brought me chocolate, and later we ended up at a motel. Once we got there, she said she felt too shy and asked me not to turn the lights on. I told her it wasn’t a problem, but her mood suddenly shifted and she became distant. We stayed for a while, then left, and I walked her home.

There was also this one time when we went to the park, spent the afternoon together, and when she was about to head home, I offered to walk her. It was clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. I left her at her place and went home.

Another moment that stands out was when her sister came to drop her off at my house, and I mentioned — half-joking, half-serious — that we never went out because she always made excuses. She got really mad at me that day.

Once, we were playing a game together, and I criticized the game. She got upset and immediately stopped playing. Later, she brought me chocolate, we spent some time together, and then she suddenly started talking about breaking up.

She invited me to go to a party with her, but later said she wasn’t going, and then changed her mind again. I got frustrated and asked if she didn’t actually want me to come. I told her I’d be there, and asked if I could arrive a bit earlier, but she made it very clear I should only show up at 6 PM.

I arrived a little earlier anyway, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. Later, we went to a friend’s party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, during the night, she casually said, “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”

After the party, we went back to her place, and she asked me to stay the night, but I ended up going home.

After all these ups and downs, I eventually called her and ended things. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had sent her into therapy and taken away her happiness. But even after all that, she messaged me saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me I should just find someone else. I was upset, and she said she was only using the app to look for her friend’s ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She replied that the feeling would pass, and mentioned she'd been somewhere and wished I had been there too. Later, she called me, inviting me to her mom's birthday party, but I didn't go. Her mom even called me, asking if I really loved her, and later invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but then she told me her dad was furious with me, which made me feel terrible. I ended up venting about it online. When she found out, she accused me of lying to her and using her, said her behavior was all because of her insecurities and autism, that she had prayed for me every day — and then she blocked me and disappeared",2,1744964215.0,AITAH,15,0.76,False
1k1zt12,https://www.reddit.com/r/branding/comments/1k1zt12/im_caving_in_to_the_mistakes_of_my_branding_i/,I'm caving in to the mistakes of my branding. I need all the advice i can get.,"hey. im a developer and i created a messaging app (like whatsapp or signal). but now i wonder if im noticing the cieling of my current branding style... and so ive decided to rebrand.

rebranding is something that was suggested to me a few times, but i think it was always going to be a big undetaking for me because as a solodev its me who would do the rebranding and i dont really have experience.

i dont know anything about marketing or sales. i ask for advice around in various subs. ultimately, i make it up as a go along using advice and best-judgement. i dont regret the approach, it was a way for me to move forward on the project. my time is 95% technical and 5% marketing (spamming/posting on reddit).

im proud of the progress on the project. so i thought i should create a website for my project to help attract users. so i reused an old domain that i wasnt using (positive-intentions.com). i got it originally because it was cheap. i naively thought i can brand anything as anything. e.g. ""starbucks"" is related to selling coffee (not ""stars"", not ""bucks"")... so my idea was to make ""positive-intentions"" related to P2P secure messaging.

after some progress on the website, i thought it could do with a splash of color so that it doesnt look entirely dry like technical drivvel (which it still seems to be). so i had a wild idea... in a world where i can get an AI can generate photorealistic images of me eating an elephant sandwich, having handdrawn images would make my project stand out, but the observation is while i have compliments about the style, its ultimately going against the value proposition of my project ""P2P secure messaging""

ive now started a rebranding process. i'll work on it a bit at a time before doing something like a full switch-over. i'll explain what im thinking here in case anyone have feedback/advice.

===

1. im moving from [https://positive-intentions.com](https://positive-intentions.com) to [https://glitr.io](https://glitr.io) \- its was clear from the onset the domain was too long. but as i kep talking about the project online, this is what search engines have indexed. i need to know more about how to move SEO related things over to the new domain. i dont know much about SEO to begin with. i dont know if i should be proud, but when i first started i noticed when search ""positive intentions"" on google my project appears on page 4+. most of the content was related to things like meditation (which is understandable). i notice more recently it appear sometimes on the first page which suggests people might be searching for it. if i move domain i'll want to take advantage of this. i'll see if i can get traffic automatically redirected to the new domain. as for the domain ""glitr.io"", i tried to think up all kinds of cooler names like ""decentra-chat"", ""decentrex"", but they were taken. (its actually why i originally decided to prop up ""positive-intentions"" as a placeholder).

2. ""positive-intentions"" has grown on me so i dont know if its worth keeping active. i was thinking of having a dichotomy between them to be ""positive-intentions"" is the ""research and development"" branch of my work and ""glitr"" could be a proper product.

3. in ""glitr"" i would be looking to get more professional-looking images for a product and removing all the handdrawn ones. there is much to be done on the website to get it to match a brand identity better. i should also redo al the content. i previsously was creating it as technical documentation. i think i now understand that i should make it user centric with things like ""how to's"".

4. there is a blog in the website. this seems very good at attracting interest in the project. i'll copy it all over and continue to occasionally post. (i dont force myself to regularly post because the blog isnt monetized and i dont have the time)

5. im sure there are countless things i havent considered. please tell me!

any feedback/advice is appriciated. feel free to ask any questions about the project.",1,1744964184.0,branding,1,1.0,False
