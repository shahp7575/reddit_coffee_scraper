I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

I use to do a lot of comedy in the city. Would write my own sketch shows and produce/be in them. Some of the best times of my life. I'm currently working on a short horror movie script to hopefully film and enter in film fest next year. I'm a creative guy. Guarantee l'd find us the best dates.

I'm looking for my other half at this point. Someone who can push me to be the best version of myself, and someone I can do the same for. Someone who I can laugh with, take trips with and just enjoy the little things.
Shoot me a message if you're interested, l'll include pics of myself (and of course but most importantly, Buddy!)",1,1730210988.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1gevh3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gevh3c/i_know_who_put_bella_in_the_wych_elm/,I know who put Bella in the Wych Elm ,"My name is Henry Johnstone, and I have a confession to make. By the time you are reading this, I will be dead at the age of 98. My grandson, Jules, is helping me write this out as I am on my deathbed. I do not have a lot of time left, so I figured before I leave this world today, I will come out with the truth. 

You may have seen the title of this post and wonder who this is ""Bella"" I speak of. I am sure there will be some folks who recognise the phrase, ""Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?"" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy is WW2. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this ""Bella"" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a ""Bella"" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one ever knew. She was may be enigmatic when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish woman who fled her homeland by herself during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these crooked teeth when she smiled, and wore a golden wedding ring. She was never seen with someone. Kornelia was not an outdoors person, but when she would leave home, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would first look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It had not been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

""Oh hiya, Henry,"" she greeted in fluent English. 

""Good morning, ma'am,"" I replied. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps."" When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

""Is there something wrong I did?"" 

""No. Well, not that I say is wrong. I just wanted to talk.""

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. ""OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?""

""I'm fine thank you.""

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

""So, what is it you wanted to talk about?"", she asked as she smiled. She had a tooth missing at the bottom of her mouth. 

""Well, I don't want to come off as rude, but I have been noticing your habit,"" I said calmly. 

""My 'habit?'""

""Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night to do ‚Äòsomething.‚Äô"" Her smile faltered a bit. ""Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too.""

She stirred the tea again. ""Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret."" Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. ""Stay here,"" she told. ""I need to give something to you."" I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

""I want you to have this,"" she said. 

I looked at her, confused. ""Why?""

""For protection.""

""Protection from what?""

""Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?"", she questioned. 

I shook my head. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?‚Äù Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

""I don't know; not really I guess.""

""Good,"" Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. ""Still, I want you to have this."" I glanced at the item, and then the woman. I reluctantly took it.

""I still don't know why I should have this."" Then she came out with an odd explanation.

""Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!""

I squinted at her. ""But why? None of what you said makes any sense.""

""It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me. No matter what, do not go outside, Henry,"" Kornelia told me with this urgency in her voice.
 
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ‚ÄòIt?‚Äô‚Äù, I questioned. She did not answer. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt,‚Äô Kornelia.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I have said enough.‚Äù That is all I can remember of the conversation. But needless to say, I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn‚Äôt spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22¬∞ halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine when I saw it. Without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were about knee deep into the forest.

""Kornelia,"" I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

""What are you doing here,"" she hissed. ""Why did you follow me?!"" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. ""Do you have your cross?"", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty. Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lent her own crucifix to me, forced it in my hand. ""You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!""

""Why are you going to the woods at night?"", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it. Something hovered behind her with a pair of blinding lights like headlights. Only they were not just lights, they were eyes. White, menacing eyes that pierced right through me. I froze right there, like I was entranced by it.


Then I saw the hulking figure, and I felt all types of fear at that moment. I knew instinctively it was some kind of demon. They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. It was white, all white. Its ‚Äòbody‚Äô was a huge, draping blanket being blown in the wind. The demon‚Äôs head was a skull of some animal; I assume it‚Äôs from a cow. Its horns were long and curved.

It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream. Seeing that, I let out a high-pitched cry as I scurried away from it. That was when the demon flung the unconscious Kornelia to the side like some ragdoll. Its next target was me. 

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. But the thing? While yes, it looked otherworldly and frightened, it had this sort of holiness to it. Like a bastardised version of holiness. No, I don't think I can even consider it an angel. I wouldn't even dare.

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. I sprinted back home, and everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. The house she lived in was vacant. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, that thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I am some lunatic.

Then came the graffiti, and the infamous pseudonym that was the talk of the town. At first, it was ‚ÄòLuebella,‚Äô then it was the aforementioned ‚ÄòBella.‚Äô There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I have been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it is that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it is for a juvenile party or a late-night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. And if it happens that you find yourself outside, just know it will come for you as it came for me.

So, as I lay on my deathbed, I have given you the truth. I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some folks call it the '22¬∞ Angel.'

Any Advice on that or other gentler methods to deal with my situation?,"I developed a crush on a year long friend of mine a few months ago. I told her about it and while she didn't reciprocate at the time, she never told me to let it go or distanced herself from me.

In the time following months we grew closer, going out 1on1 and just generally being very emotionally intimate with one another. The vibe in these meetings is great. There is never a pause in our discussions and we laugh a lot together.

When I offered her my help a few weeks ago in preparing for a party she's hosting, she appreciated that dearly, but also added that we could just go for some coffee at her place instead.

However, for the most part it is me, that initiates our plans for meet ups. She does her best to accommodate since she is quite busy and she says herself that she is quite bad at keeping up with others, especially through text, but it still bugs me.

Last week I asked her for a meet up and she seemed really excited for it, even pushing for a potential early time slot. However due to her being out of town she asked me to remind her the following week. I did and she thanked me for it, but then she just kinda forgot about it again, I guess, I don't know. That's where I'm at at the moment.

I know she's busy and I also know that I'm quite invested in this relationship/friendship. I just fear that due to my feelings I might be coming off as needy when I'm generally not and don't intend to. I just wish there was more of a back & forth in our  remote communication to better judge our dynamic.

So yeah, contemplating if I should gain distance for some time to collect myself, however that works or if there is some other gentler way to deal with this as I do not intend to put her under pressure.

As you prepare for the arrival of your little one, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure you have the necessary items to make this transition as smooth as possible. From nursery essentials to on-the-go necessities, this guide will help you understand what to look for in a stroller, the best infant car seat choices, and how to set up functional high chairs from newborn. Let‚Äôs dive into these must-have items for your newborn!

**Nurturing the Perfect Newborn Room**

Before your baby arrives, you‚Äôll want to create a nurturing space. Decorating a nursery is more than just aesthetics; it should be a cozy haven for both you and your newborn. Here are some newborn room ideas to consider:

**Color Schemes**

Choose soothing colors that promote relaxation. Soft pastels, muted tones, or even monochromatic shades can create a calming ambiance. Make sure to have a mix of colors that appeal to your style while also being versatile enough as your child grows.

**Nursery Furniture**

* [**Crib**](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/cribs)**:**¬†A safe and comfortable place for your newborn to sleep is essential. Look for cribs that meet safety standards and have adjustable mattress heights.
* [**Changing table**](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/changing-tables)**:**¬†This makes diaper duty easier and more organized. Invest in a sturdy changing table with storage options for diapers and wipes.
* [**Glider or rocking chair**](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/nursery-chair)**:**¬†Having a comfortable spot to feed or soothe your baby can make a world of difference.

**The Importance of an Infant Car Seat**

One of the most critical purchases you‚Äôll make is an infant car seat. An infant car seat is an absolute must-have for safely transporting your newborn. Here‚Äôs what to keep in mind when selecting one:

**Safety Features**

When looking for an infant car seat, safety should be your top priority. Look for car seats that have passed safety tests and include features such as side-impact protection, 5-point harness systems, and easy installation options.

**Ease of Use**

Choose a model that‚Äôs easy to install. Many newer car seats come with a base that makes it simpler to secure the seat in your vehicle. Consider how easily you can remove the car seat from the base for those quick grocery trips or visits to the pediatrician.

**Comfort**

Make sure the seat has ample cushioning and support for your newborn. A snug fit is crucial, as your baby should feel secure without any excess movement.

**Invest in a Quality Stroller**

[Strollers](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/baby-stroller)¬†provide mobility and convenience, making outings with your newborn stress-free. But what to look for in a stroller? Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

**Weight and Portability**

Look for a lightweight and easily¬†[foldable stroller](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/venice-child-maverick-stroller-with-2nd-seat-eclipse)¬†that can be transported without hassle. This will make trips to and from the car much more manageable. The last thing you want is a bulky stroller that‚Äôs difficult to maneuver.

**Adaptability**

Choose a stroller that can grow with your child. Many models offer convertible features, allowing you to use it from birth through toddlerhood. Some will even accommodate a second seat or a buggy board for older siblings.

**Storage Options**

A good stroller should have ample storage space for diaper bags, groceries, and personal items. Look for strollers with easy-to-access compartments that allow for convenient storage while you‚Äôre on the go.

**Feeding Essentials: High Chairs from Newborn**

As your newborn grows, you‚Äôll need to consider eating essentials. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what to keep in mind when selecting¬†[high chairs](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/collections/high-chair)¬†from newborn:

**Adjustable Features**

Choose a high chair that can adjust in height and reclining position for comfort. This flexibility helps ensure your baby can sit comfortably as they grow and transition from bottle-feeding to solid foods.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Babies are messy eaters, so select a high chair with removable and washable covers. A model that can be easily wiped down will save you time during mealtimes.

**Space-saving Design**

If you‚Äôre short on space, look for a high chair that can be folded away or has a slim profile. There are plenty of designs that don‚Äôt take up much room but still provide all the necessary features.

**Diapering Must-Haves**

A well-stocked diaper station can save you countless hours of stress. Here are some essentials you must have:

* **Diapers:**¬†Stock up on different sizes as your newborn grows quickly.
* **Wipes:**¬†Choose hypoallergenic wipes for gentle cleaning.
* **Diaper rash cream:**¬†A good barrier cream can protect your baby‚Äôs delicate skin.
* **Diaper pail:**¬†A proper disposal system keeps odors at bay.

**Bath Time Gear**

Bathing your newborn can be more enjoyable with the right tools. Here‚Äôs what you need in the bath essentials department:

# Baby Bathtub

A specially designed¬†[baby bathtub](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/contours-oasis-2-in-1-comfort-cushion-tub-white-zn007-mnt1)¬†will help keep your newborn safe and secure while bathing. Look for a model that can be used in the sink or tub.

# Soft Towels

Invest in plush,¬†[soft towels](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/unique-love-design-bath-towel)¬†that are gentle on your baby's sensitive skin. Hooded towels can be especially helpful for keeping your little one warm and cozy after bath time.

# Baby Shampoo and Body Wash

Choose gentle, tear-free shampoos and body washes made specifically for infant skin to ensure a safe bathing experience.

# The Power of Baby Monitors

Keeping a watchful eye on your newborn is crucial, even when you‚Äôre in another room. A baby monitor can give you peace of mind:

# Video vs. Audio Monitors

Decide whether you want a simple audio monitor or a video monitor that allows you to see your baby while they sleep. Video monitors can provide added comfort but come at an additional expense.

# Range and Battery Life

Look for monitors with a good range and reliable battery life, ensuring you can hear or see your baby no matter where you are in the house.

# Clothing Essentials for Newborns

Having the right clothing is paramount for keeping your newborn comfortable and warm:

# Onesies

A handful of soft, stretchy¬†[onesies](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/unique-love-design-muslin-bodysuit-grey)¬†will be your go-to outfit for your baby. Look for easy snap closures for quick diaper changes.

# Pajamas

Sleep is key for newborns, so invest in¬†[soft pajamas](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/unique-love-design-muslin-bathrobe-oak-brown)¬†that allow for movement and comfort as they snooze.

# Layers

Since newborns are sensitive to temperature changes, layering options such as cardigans or¬†[lightweight blankets](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/unique-love-design-premium-cashmere-blanket)¬†can help regulate their body temperature.

# A Little Me Time

Being a new parent is rewarding but often overwhelming. Don‚Äôt forget to carve out some ""me time"" to recharge. Whether it‚Äôs indulging in a book, taking a short walk, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee while your baby sleeps, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your newborn!

With this comprehensive list of must-haves for your newborn, you can create a comfortable, safe, and nurturing environment. By investing in the right gear, you‚Äôll not only make life easier but also create lasting memories in those precious early days with your little one. Embrace this new chapter, as it holds the promise of beautiful moments just waiting to be created!

I read that descaling it may help? I‚Äôve recently moved and decided to try my luck again and see if it would work and again it leaked coffee from the bottom. Anyone have any ideas of what I could do? I heard trying to go through customer service is a long process and it was barely used so it should not have these issues so soon.

My (32F) husband (33M) says he‚Äôll vote for Trump again in this election (he voted for him in the past). 

I knew he was a Republican when we met and got married but he said he was not a total conservative and to be honest never saw anything indicating that, it was always pretty easy to talk about a lot of things that the usual conservatives hate. 

I should probably add that I‚Äôm an immigrant and I didn‚Äôt know much about politics in this country when I got here 5 years ago, but overtime I realized I am very much on the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù side. I believe in equality, freedom, respect and human rights. 

Things have gotten pretty tense between us these past few days because the subject of the election came up and he said he‚Äôll of course vote for him. I asked him why and he said because he did great things for our country, that he was a good president and he knows he‚Äôs what we need. I was shocked. I asked him about all the despicable things Trump has said over the years and the last few months, the way he treats others, the lack of respect for women, how he makes fun of disabled people (I worked with disabled kids for a while so this is something that really makes me angry), the way he talks about immigrants, how he doesn‚Äôt care about basic human rights and all the hate he spreads, and his response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with a lot of the things he has said but I do agree with how he ran the country before and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll do great things again‚Äù. 

I am so disappointed in him. Hearing him said that after all the things I said really hurt. I am an immigrant from a Latin American country and I feel like my husband is not only not standing up for me as that, but also as a woman, as his wife. It hurts that he doesn‚Äôt see how this man that he is voting for goes against pretty much everything I am and everything I believe in, and I thought we believed in, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

We were planning to have a baby and right now I‚Äôm a mess, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how we will raise our kids or what will I tell them when they ask who did daddy vote for before and how could he do that knowing all that he knew about how he talked and treated other people. 

I almost forgot to add this. His parents are MAGA, 100% idolize Trump. Their house is full of pictures of him, they have signs in their front lawn, the car, on their golf cart, their garage has a shrine to him, they wear his MAGA hats all day everyday no matter where we go, they have keychains with his name, shirts, coffee mugs, tumblers, you name it. I try not to go visit them much because is really frustrating, and I always said to myself ‚Äúthank God my husband isn‚Äôt like that‚Äù, but knowing he wants to vote for Trump now really makes me rethink everything and I hate it because he really is a good man, I don‚Äôt understand how he can vote for him. I‚Äôm heartbroken. 

I‚Äôm spiraling and probably rambling at this point but I have no one else to talk to right now and just needed to vent and see if anyone here has any advice or is going through the same thing. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice of kind words at this moment are greatly appreciated

ETA: The last thing he told me was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for ‚Äòhim‚Äô, I‚Äôm voting for the Republican Party and what they stand for‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really think that makes everything better, it definitely doesn‚Äôt make me feel better, but though I should mention it. ",0,1730210302.0,AskWomenOver30,9,0.29,False

1gev5zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1gev5zn/venice_was_amazing/,Venice was amazing,"Just spent five nights in Venice, thanks for all the advice in this sub. I was with my 68 and 71 year old parents. 

Day 1: Arrived at airport in afternoon. Took the orange line Alilaguna to Rialto. Was super simple to buy the ticket at the kiosk at baggage claim. Easy walk to the boat. Got off and walked ten minutes to our airbnb. 

Went for a walk around, holy crap Rialto is busy. While it was a convenient location, I didnt care for all the retail shops. 

We went for dinner at Muro Frari, had pizza, vognole and spaghetti seppia. I waa here for the marathon, so was searching for carbs first. The pizza was mediocre, the rest were passable, but the worst meal so far. 

Day 2. Bought the Museum Pass, which is a great deal for my parents with the discount rate. Walked right into Doge palace. Beautiful, and definitely worthwhile. Also went into Museo Correr which was interesting too. Had lunch at Pasta Pasta, which was better than Muro Frari. 

We bought the 3 day vaporetto pass, which is a must for exploring Venice. It was so easy to hop on and off. We must have taken over 20 trips while we were there. 

First stop was Giorgio. And we headed to the marathon expo at San Guiliano. Had dinner, more pizza at Dai Fioi, which was decent, but again below expectations. We get pretty good pizza with electric ovens in Vancouver so was a bit surprised. But its carbs and thats what I needed. 

Day 3. Went to the modern art museum, but first coffee in the beautiful cafe. The oriental museum was the best part, but Im not much of a modern arts person. 

We took the boat to Burano, and mostly walked around. Had some chichetti at Aqua Salsa, beautiful spot, decent eats, loved the baccaro? (white cod) and quiet. 

Dinner at Antico Gateleco. Fritto misto, seppia, seafood pasta were all delicious. Finally get closer to the good food. 

Day 4. Ran the Venice Marathon, which is an incredible race. Happy to share more about that. Parents cheered me on in San Marco at km41. 

Post race celebration at Cafe La Serra. Beautiful setting, decent ""toast""

We booked a ticket for the rooftop terrace, but it closed ""due to weather"" when we got there. Too bad as it was a beautiful evening. 

Dinner was at Nevodi, which was amazing. So good that we made a reservation for the next night. Our budget is in the 100 euro for 3 ppl, so we didnt seek out higher end restos. Walked around Punta della Dogana after (the vaporetto pass is so great). 

Day 5. 

Loved Museo Fortuny. Ate some tramezzino at Bar Alla Tolleta. Yum. Then a row with Row Venice, made a booking the night prior. Highly recommend for an authentic experience, we didnt want to just sit on a boat. We walked around some more, and then dinner again at Nevodi. No regrets. 

Day 6. 

Woke up early, walked around in the mist and caught sunrise at Accademia bridge. Wow. Had a cafe at Caffe Rosso, gelato at Suso. Walked with our rolling luggage from Rialto to the train station. They had large luggage, my mom was fine but I swapped my carryon sized with my dad. our 72hr ticket was expired and didnt feel like paying another 9.50 each. We spent that on cichetti at Osteria al Tappo, waiting for our train in the nice courtyard. 

Walked to train station too early, i had prebooked Italo tickets, checked the signboard and got on the train. Large baggage overhead no problem, pdf of my tickets were checked onboard later. 

Next stop Bologna! Ill be there for four nights, looking forward to more exploring! Any suggestions? two day trips to Ferrara and Ravenna are the current plans before we head to Florence then Rome.",9,1730210026.0,ItalyTravel,1,1.0,False

My name is Leigh (they/them), I‚Äôm a master‚Äôs student of anthropology at the University of Copenhagen, and I‚Äôm doing my thesis research on the lived experiences of genderqueer persons in Denmark. My research has two primary focuses: (1) practices of gender-affirming care‚Äìwhich I define very broadly as any care practices that affirm one‚Äôs gender, not limited to biomedical means, and (2) trans futures, and how they are imagined and invoked.¬†

I am looking for people who are willing to participate in research interviews, with the possibility of further involvement if interested (demonstrating practices of gender-affirming care, group interviews, or attending queer community events and sharing your experience). All participation will be anonymized unless you would like to be referred to by first name.¬†Participation is compensated with coffee, cake, and queer comradery.

Whether or not you have sought biomedical transgender healthcare within the Danish system, I am interested in learning about your experience as a trans person in Denmark, with regard to gender-affirming care, social life, personal life, and cultural values.¬†You do not have to be Danish to participate, just have lived in Denmark for at least 6 months. 

Ultimately, my research seeks to bring attention to trans people's experiences with gender-affirming care, how they navigate barriers to care, and how a more liveable future can be achieved. If you would be willing to help me in this pursuit, please reach out through my email [zgn666@alumni.ku.dk](mailto:zgn666@alumni.ku.dk) and I will provide further information. In an effort to keep this post short and sweet, there are certainly details missing, so if you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask.¬†

All the best,

Leigh W.

1gev1ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gev1ys/40_male_uk_extreme_weakness_and_worrying_lack_of/,"40, male, UK. Extreme weakness and worrying lack of dexterity upon waking in both hands, sometimes lasting several hours, making even basic tasks very difficult or even impossible in some cases.","6ft, about 215lbs.

History:

I've had a precious microdiscectomy at L4/L5 in 2016. It removed a good amount of the herniated disc, but not all, and I have scar tissue that seems to have encased the nerves in that area which still causes me some issues - still a lot of pain from the top of my bum down into my foot.

My overall disc health isn't great, they're quite dehydrated on previous MRIs. I had an MRI last week so I am waiting on the results as I'd been having back pain much higher up - in my thoracic spine area, at the shoulder blade height that was causing a lot of pain when breathing in, but was only really ever an issue in the morning and wore off during the day, which is similar to another issue that has developed below. Clots, cancer, and heart related issues had already been ruled out as my GP sent me to the hospital when I went in for a routine appointment about it.

Since then..

When I wake up, I very often feel extremely weak and have almost no dexterity in both of my hands/arms for a period of time. I woke up at 08:00 today and I didn't get normal strength/dexterity back until about 12:00 (mid day) . This is the longest it's ever lasted for, generally it's only an hour or so maximum.

To give some context to the lack of dexterity:

I had serious difficulty in buttoning the top button of my jeans and pulling the zip up. It feels like I also cannot make a fist and I have next to zero grip strength. Putting the car into reverse was difficult as I had to attend an appointment and even just lifting the button to apply the electric handbrake was extremely difficult. Even things like pulling a card out of my wallet is difficult. I wouldn't be able to grip/lift a kettle with water in it to make a drink and I would likely struggle to even hold a cup of coffee and drink from it.

It is only ever an issue in the morning, it's not every day, and it has happened in the past, but it seems to be progressively getting worse overtime.

The MRI might show some issue, but in the case it doesn't, I'd really like any opinions on what might be causing this. Not being able to properly use my hands for several hours is extremely worrying, especially when it's basic things like zipping up my jeans, holding a cup, turning a door handle knob, using my phone.

This is only ever an issue after sleeping and being immobile while I sleep.

Finally, it's probably unrelated but I seem to have developed Convergence insufficiency Disorder within the last few weeks. It came about when my partner was close to my face and noticed that my left eye was looking at her, but my right eye wasn't. I've been given exercises to do and hopefully it will go away, but thought it worth mentioning from a neurological standpoint.

I'd appreciate any input on this as not being able to use my hands very well at all is extremely concerning to me.",1,1730209706.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Profitec pro 300 (cheapest DB, and with the Profitec MOVE coming out, maybe the pro 300 will get discounted?) - 8.5 min heat up.

is a DB an overkill? I don't see much $ difference between the Classika and Profitec 300.

Should I stay on single boiler? If so, is the Classika worth the premium $ vs Unica? Should I just get the cheapest SB machine (Lelit Victoria) and then upgrade in a few years? 

is the E61 high maintenance and worth it? 

Is it worth waiting for Black Friday sales? if so, from your past experience what's the best online retailer that has good offers/door busters? What kind of discounts do they do? do they just throw in few bucks worth of accessories or are the machine significantly discounted?

Sorry for the many questions!

1geuhgs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1geuhgs,Alocasia Polly Help!!,"So I got this guy from my mom randomly a couple months ago, and I put it in my office. Have it set up with a plant light. Recently, I was out of work for nearly a week, and I came back to it looking like this. Two leaves are brown and droopy, quite soft, no crispyness. The other two leaves are doing okay, but one is slowly turning yellow at the tip.

I checked the soil once I got back to work and it seemed dry, so I watered it. I'm bad about forgetting to water my plants, so I have an alarm set to water this one every Friday. I give it maybe half of a disposable paper coffee cup of water.

Someone suggested to me (after I had watered it) that it might have root rot and that I should let it dry out some. So I took the cover pot off and let it sit outside for the day. It was an overcast day so there was no worry about direct sunlight. As a result it seems the soil has drained a little bit better, but it's still moist.

What are suggested next steps? I'm leaving the cover pot off of it, and it's currently sitting on a plate as shown in the photos. The soil that it's in currently is the soil that came with it, so I do have plans to change out the soil for a mixture of peat moss, local organic fertilized soil, and probably some perlite and sulphur. But I don't know how to deal with potential root rot, so suggestions are appreciated.

But should you go the traditional in-person route, or consider a virtual assistant (VA)? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why a VA might be the smarter choice for your business.

# 1. Save Big on Costs üí∏

Hiring in-person means overhead costs ‚Äî office space, equipment, taxes, benefits, you name it. A virtual assistant can eliminate many of these expenses. VAs work remotely, so you won‚Äôt need to pay for an extra desk, computer, or even coffee! And because most virtual assistants are hired on an as-needed basis (often hourly or per project), you only pay for the exact amount of work you need done, making this option way more affordable.

# 2. Flexibility to Work Around the Clock üïì

One of the biggest advantages of a VA is flexibility. Virtual assistants are available worldwide, meaning you can tap into a global talent pool. Have tasks that need handling in off-hours or overnight? A VA in a different time zone can handle it while you sleep. This setup is ideal for businesses with international clients or those with tasks that need near-constant attention, as you‚Äôre not limited by local office hours.

# 3. More Time for Core Business Tasks üöÄ

By delegating repetitive tasks ‚Äî like managing emails, scheduling, or data entry ‚Äî to a VA, you free up time to focus on your core business activities. This means more attention on the tasks that actually drive growth, whether it‚Äôs strategic planning, meeting with clients, or diving into your product development. With routine duties taken off your plate, your day-to-day workflow becomes streamlined, allowing for way more productivity and mental clarity.

Virtual assistants save you money, offer flexible hours, and free up time for the things that really matter. They‚Äôre a game-changer for entrepreneurs and business owners looking to scale efficiently without the usual overhead!

What do you think? Have you tried working with a VA, or are you considering it? Let‚Äôs discuss!

Today is the 90th edition of Open Interest and at the same time, a date which many, many of us - especially those of us here at Open Interest - have been waiting on for a long time. In light of these facts, today's edition is going to be a bit longer than usual. We're going to touch on our usual analytics, plus a deeper dive into yesterday's options activity, and some thoughts on the CATalyst for 10/29. Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/28 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/rak9ivzmfoxd1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e8d7e9012c9283bea5e6984af06bb765a752710)

As was likely palpable to anyone observing the Stonk yesterday, this was an uncommon day. I had mentioned in yesterday's post that MM gamma exposure structure duplicated that of our set up last week, which is to say that a gamma ramp was in place for some upward dynamism. In fact, you'll recall that for several weeks I've been writing about the formation and filling in of this very dense positive gamma bracket in the $20-$22 range for a number of weeks. Under low volume conditions, this produced a sensitive run-up last Friday, but one which ultimately ended in a Max Pain finish of $20.50.

Thus, as result of this, there was no reason to suggest - outside of the anticipation for the 10/29 CATalyst - that there would be a 10+% run-up yesterday, a Monday, that would run our full pre-market gamma ramp and then build it out up through $22.50 with sustained Bullish options flow into the close. That's exactly what we got, though.

So, why would I say this wasn't anticipated outside of the 10/29 CATalyst expectation?

You'll notice that our gamma squeezes over the past few months have come on Fridays. Why? As I have written here several times, this is the optimal time to launch a short-term gamma squeeze, that is very close to an options expiry. As time approaches options expiries - weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies, etc - options dealers shed their hedges through theta (time value) and charm (delta value loss over time) decay. Sprinkle in some trading range constriction and lower IV conditions, and dealers will be minimally hedged on the contracts of a given options expiry versus a day farther away from expiry.

By vaccuuming up cheap, depressed-value contracts close to expiry, then injecting demand into the lit market via shares or options flows, an institution or individual can quickly shoot the price into a positive feedback loop where MM hedging algorithms rush to hedge their short calls and long puts by buying shares. This slingshots the price up and causes long call positions to appreciate exponentially in a matter of minutes (which can then, on the flipside, can be exited and entered short on momentum hype into the close for another huge gain as the price cools off and OTM options expire worthless). Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

Institutions have frequently played this dynamic with our Stonk since 8/30, pumping the price on Fridays after carefully building out Long Call positions at the right strikes only to flip short and walk the price down in the following hours or days.

Sometimes, on Mondays, there is a run-up based on options assignment. Not everyone sells calls perfectly covered (like retail has to). MMs often anticipate the best time to purchase shares for delivery on expected ITM options obligations is Monday, their T+1 deadline, rather than buying on a Friday run when it could risk sending even MORE short calls into the money, require more purchasing, etc.

But last Friday was a Max Pain finish... they should've been perfectly hedged for that expiry - it literally couldn't have gone more favorably for them down to the penny. So yesterday's buying had nothing to do with covering settlement obligations.

We had a lot of dark pool volume, but not 'banner orders' to trigger a run on the options market. There were no crazy huge single options orders, no stupidly big lit trades, and CERTAINLY no news... not even a peep from the 'analysts' on a 10+% runup in the Stonk after weeks of low volume and heavily constricted sideways trading.

There was ONE factor and one factor ONLY that pumped yesterday's price:

Heavy. Bullish. Options flow.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

So what did this options flow look like? Well for starters, it was highly bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/sw76ktp2poxd1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cbcff34b05449dc4af5a9fe53a9e5f15704f287

53.29% is a highly bullish premium ratio, on top of the fact the the total options' premium value spent yesterday exceeded our daily average last week by more than 500%. It also looks like a familiar friend, with our largest single options order on the day, made a 'splash' ...

https://preview.redd.it/wu0ysoskpoxd1.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9101208d09455914c05315c9cdd3b4de9b6253a

That's right, Tactical Whale 688 is BACK in the game with 688 x $20 Calls for December!

[\\""Assaw, dude!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/t23mcrd1qoxd1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb50750c1c1f92eed1527c43d3d6224d25d255d2)

Now, all this hasn't moved any Max Pain strikes... yet. But it did LITTER our options chain out through November OPEX with new Call OI. Look:

[11\/1 OI Changes 10\/28-29](https://preview.redd.it/3rpx7y15noxd1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=c827cf481fcf59683f44e0b1868f7d21ecb1360f)

That's a lotta calls! Most of them at the ASK. Oh and those 1,000 Puts at $22? Yup. All short.

[11\/8 OI Changes 10\/28-29](https://preview.redd.it/j26lkr7cnoxd1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=9499b6048417363e7148fa36bfd0055d7b6806df)

This is also an uncharacteristically high number of calls for the following week - especially on no news or announcement expectations (that we know of). Again, this was all at the ask - actually even more heavily at the ask compared to the 11/1 new OI.

[11\/15 OI Changes 10\/28-29](https://preview.redd.it/wd1dsexnnoxd1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=9192d6910e30682a66fd79204f3f4664e0bca968)

The most conspicuous strike here for November OPEX is $25 for calls at 2200+. These were also mostly at the ask spread across a couple decent-sized orders throughout the day, the biggest being about 800 contracts at around 1pm.

[12\/20 OI Changes 10\/28-29](https://preview.redd.it/ku748sdsnoxd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=31f68fe12ce6c9bedb223985ce9e896da3f6d13c)

Here for Dec OPEX we see TW688's characterist 688 calls piled up at $20 with some extra cheddar and a Put OI expansion at $19. Is someone counterbalancing him with bearish expectations?

[Oh... no, not really.](https://preview.redd.it/pm4745vgsoxd1.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f4c27e0ecabbb98a0f8cf8bfd60db28ebc1c437)

For January we've got some interesting profit taking on Puts and Calls, plus some new OI positions at $18 and $25. The $18 Puts?

So, yeah. Safe to say, Options Market is excited right now.

**Gamma Exposure**

How bullish is this in terms of MM Gamma Exposure? Well we had an interesting value emerge in our total weekly GEX ratio trend:

https://preview.redd.it/vhbmfh24yoxd1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=a123805e2510f8f33f9b9e748857c066c6b2c89d

Yeah, in one day our P/C GEX ratio went from 1:2.5 to 1:4.5. That's a big jump. We've cracked 0.3 once before (.29) in September, but this was a gradual Call accumulation, nothing nearly as quick. And how low is that ratio? We've only had 5 days YTD where the premarket ratio value was equal or lower. Here they are:

https://preview.redd.it/xv1x9kf1zoxd1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=573e3a92d1d757b590af03aad4cb30f7dc17819d

Yeah, that's it. That's the only time. Now, keep in mind, correlation doesn't mean causation and historical performance doesn't necessarily predict future results, but these data are good to keep in mind and observe as we move forward. Let's look at our daily GEX by strike now:

https://preview.redd.it/73ujnjlkzoxd1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=400ffdd9e4fc4e11e7dac2bd29838b98c6634e3e

Yeah, as we can, MMs have basically NO net put exposure. Our $21-$23 is highly downside volatility suppressant, though $22.50 is a little light on the overall GEX so it's comparatively weaker than the strikes around it. It could serve as a good strike for intraday scrubba-dub on options market indecisiveness, but if Options buyers can continue to fill in Call GEX at $23.50 and $24.50 while sustaining volume and options demand, the price can grind higher. It was a very good sign that the price consolidated and held $22+  throughout the day yesterday after our initial reversal dip toward $21.75.

We'll have to see what comes, but holding our current price level, especially earlier in the week, is a strong possibility based on our 'mounting' of that thick gamma positive bracket. If Options Market sentiment does reverse and the price go with it, it'll take a fair number of days to move back down. There is too much suggesting this isn't a one and done affair.

**Technicals**

[8\/19-10\/15 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/cffri56j1pxd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c59fa7a8184012253ab1620a4ea775fd451da10e)

[8\/1-10\/28 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/pgtcjgl6foxd1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=310177a35ec6cf2ef85d6dbf8439f54e0ea0c47b)

Our closing price right now is still in line with our 50SMA $1 'over-extended' level, so we could stagnate and reverse here for a depreciation back to $21ish into November OPEX to keep the Dorito intact, but then our Ascending Triangle Dorito Paradigm is really done. RSI and IV are now just shy of our September OPEX pump levels.

Today is really a moment of truth in all this.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/b7znbh8a2pxd1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3db85a31e9b4cd59eef311f51b61ce6c314564

Yoinkity-Yoink, would you look at that! Volume and Call demand comes in and IV shoots right back up. Bearish IV trend broken and piss-missiling to about 75% of our Q2 EARNINGS report levels. This is responsible for all those call value appreciations, but it also does incentivize IV sales into this pump, which was responsible for our high bearish premium volume yesterday (though it was drowned by bullish premiums). Will desire to farm that IV overtake whatever CATalyst - technical, fundamental, mechanical, sentimental - that could be going on behind the charts? Or will the CATalyst drive desire higher? Let's find out...

**Synthesis**

So, f\*cq, everyboy's up right now! What do we make of this?

There are three (3) factors I can point to that could explain this activity. Let's go through them systematically:

1. Technical Breakout Begins:

The Dorito of Doom (TM) ascending triangle pattern has reached maturity and has telegraphed consensus breakout based on the undesirability of the continued $20.50-$21.50 trading range we spent all of October stuck within. The \*true\* market sentiment on the Stonk is that it is criminally undervalued (literally) and there are too many parties bullishly interested for bears to continue to contain the Stonk in its current technical paradigm.

2) The CATalyst:

So what really \*is\* the CATalyst? While it based on the 1-2-3 postings yearly of Avocado-in-my-A\*\*\*\*\*\*, it could be something much like Keith's other meme activities, namely that it is a symbolic signal to retail that some major behind-the-scenes BS activity is destined to take place on or around our current date. The only real lead I have in any of this is what went on with the AIMA (the Alternative Investment Management Association) Global Investor Forum in Toronto (which happened at the beginning of October) and the AIMA-APAC Conference in Hong Kong which kicked off last Thursday and concluded over the weekend. These events always happen in October.

I don't know if this has anything to do with the CATalyst, but this is to illustrate that something like this could telegraph behind-the-scenes catalysts to \*financial\* insiders. It could also be a 'two of them talking' moment with RCEO, who tweeted cryptically with possible partial symbolic gestures to Superstonk inside references.

My point here? We could be seeing options activity based on the expectation alone of this occurring on October 29 regardless of whether we get an Avocado post from Keith or not. And maybe that was his intent, all along knowing how the algos and FundFriends want to find ways to exploit everything he does on the internet to run cover for their derivatives plays.

3) Anti-CATalyst:

Okay, this one is 100% not FUD, so please don't take it that way. I am bullish on GME in the short, mid, and long terms regardless of this, but I have to put this out there.

This \*could\* \*COULD\* be a fake, a near term bull trap. When it comes to the options market, euphoria is the #1 retail demand driver and the #1 retail account killer. The entire options market (in fact, all casinos as well) is built on this fundamental truth with respect human psychology and our orientation toward the pursuit of potential value.

Just like we might be getting a 'reflexivity' pump here which appreciates the price based on the 10/29 expectation, this could be exploited by institutions who will rug pull the price and flatten us for another month to pocket off this big IV pump we just got yesterday.

Now, I think there is a lot more on the board here to suggest one or both of the first two more so than the latter, but in risk assessment, we need to consider all angles here. There is definitely plenty to suggest this is more than just a fluke pump in the context of a much slower move up, but it wouldn't be responsible or truthful to ignore a possible trick or trap waiting in the wings.

**Concluding Remarks + TA;DR**

So to recap, this can definitely run. Consolidation intraday yesterday was a great sign and bullish options sentiment was present in force yesterday. This could be CATalyst related, pertain to something behind the scenes, or be a bull trap in order to farm IV into November. It's unlike we get any MAJOR downside volatility in the short term, however, so some observation of the intraday circumstances is not risky at a hair's breadth.

Of course, we've also got everybody's favorite Keith to look out for....

Good luck out there!

Cheers

When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor.

The first 3 days I had a headache each day, and basically felt like I had a cold. Around noon I would get incredibly tired and take a nap, which I never took naps before quitting. After 3 days things got more tolerable, I had absolutely no desire to drink coffee or caffeine. It actually made me feel sick to think about.

Well now I‚Äôm 2 weeks in and I am really feeling tired and have an extremely high desire for coffee. I never used to drink espresso besides trying it once, but right now a triple shot espresso sounds amazing. I‚Äôm still planning to tough it out.

Here are the things I‚Äôve noticed, not anything I‚Äôm directly tying to stopping caffeine but just things I‚Äôve noticed:

Bad:
- Felt sick first few days
- Extreme anxiety days 2-5 
- Insomnia from 2am - 4am first 3 nights (weirdly consistent)
- Mid day naps (arguably good)
- 2 weeks in and definitely more tired/craving caffeine

Good:
- I fall asleep faster than I ever have. It used to take 15mins to hours to fall asleep before. Now it‚Äôs under 5 minutes
- It does seem like I have less brain fog
- Blood pressure has gone back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù

My Lelit Anna has finally run its course over six years of service and I'm now in need of an upgraded replacement. 
After some research I landed on either the Profitec Jump or 600.
I did have a lot of issues with my Anna, so my priorities are
1. Dependable machine (that can last at least 5 years hopefully up to 10)
2. Strong steam wand. The Anna had a small boiler that if I make a mistake with my milk steaming I'll have to wait for it to come back 
3. Ease of use. I wake up groggy and want to make a solid milk drink.

Other info 
I'm the only coffee drinker at home and I mostly only make 1-2 milk drinks a day but I want to make them count!

I rarely drink espresso but I do love lighter roasts. 
I'm more happy paying $2000 with tax but can go up a bit but wondering if it's really worth it for my use case?

I don't mind buying open box but I don't want to buy used. I'm also based in the US.
Would love to know the opinion of those who have either machine or similar machine. I know HX machines aren't loved by this sub but the price of the Jump with those wooden touch points are so good! 
Are double boilers more durable than HX machines?

While no one is perfect, I think the key to a successful relationship is built on mutual understanding, patience, honesty and growing together.

I'm at a point where I know I have a lot to offer. I'm affectionate, kind, sensitive, loyal, financially and mentally stable (most of the time I promise). My favourite way to show love is cooking, spending quality time together, touch, cute pet names and sharing inside jokes. While I'll always be on your team, I'm not the type to sugarcoat things when life throws us challenges. I've been told I can be a bit direct at times but I do my best to be sensitive so I hope for the same kindness in return.

In my free time, I enjoy yapping about my day, after dinner walks, pilates, coffee, travelling and spending time with my friends. While I enjoy most weekend in, I do like going on the occasional road trip to break up my monotonous routine so a homebody would not be a good fit.

I'm asian, dark hair, short, fair, college educated, drug free, not big on drinking, partying or smoking. I'm not into gaming, anime or cosplay.

I'm looking for someone who's emotionally available, shares a similar values and lifestyle. I do want kids and a family one day. We don't need to have the same hobbies or like the same things but I want a relationship where we feel safe to express ourselves, work as a team to solve challenges together, learn from each other and grow together. None of that silent treatment or being abusive or revengeful stuff. Please, if you're fresh out of a long term relationship or indecisive, leave me alone!

I'm attracted to guys who know what they want, reliable, responsible, able to lead and takes care of themselves mentally and physically. Ideally, you work in an office setting, college educated or at least curious about the world. I travel about twice a year often to explore new places, visit my friends and family who lives all over. While attraction is important, I value someone who wants the same things as me even more.

**Potential deal breakers: Be 27 and above, no smokers, drugs, big drinkers or people who are way into partying/ raves. Please be located in Australia or willing to relocate here eventually. Please introduce yourself, age, location etc.**

P.S. Not sure if this is a deal breaker for the atheists out there but I do believe in some ""woo woo"" stuff like law of attraction, power of the universe and manifestation. However, I don't see myself as religious as I believe religious institutions to be corrupted, judgmental and controlling but I can see their place in society to provide support and community for those who don't have it.",0,1730207576.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.25,False

1geua7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mikrofon/comments/1geua7j/ive_worked_as_a_crime_scene_investigator_for_25/,I've worked as a crime scene investigator for 25 years. This is my weirdest case.,"On the 25th of November 2018, the victim pulled into a budget motel in the early hours of the morning. He booked room 12 for a three day stay, and on the fourth day the owner of the establishment sent his son to check on the victim. What he found was something that someone his age should never have witnessed. Or anyone for that matter.

By the time I arrived at the scene, it had already been cordoned off. Members of the county police department had swarmed the area and in the absence of the sun, it was the blue and red flashing lights that cast their glow over the building. I made my way past the tenants who were half-asleep, doing their best at giving witness testimonial.I stepped by a particularly shaken forensic pathologist who was trying to call his mother and entered room 12.

Now, I've been working as a crime scene investigator for more than twenty years. I have dealt with some truly confounding scenes before. In 2006, a body of a missing hiker was found in the woods just on the county line. It had been burnt to a crisp, but only the upper half. Below the waist was completely untouched, as was the surrounding area.

More recently, a farmer reported a break in just after New year's eve. Presumably, someone had broken into his warehouse which housed an industrial animal carcass shredder. It had been used in the night and a pile of jellied flesh was found clumped at its mouth. Horrifically, it was eventually proven to be human, although couldn't be identified beyond that. Only one other thing was found at the scene. Within the remains was a small steel plaque, about the size of a business card, with the number 0002916 engraved in it.

I say all this for simple context. I am no stranger to the unexplainable, but what I saw in Room 12‚Ä¶ it still keeps me up at night. The following are excerpts from the crime scene report I filed that day.

Incident Number: 24-0711

Date of Incident: November 29, 2018

Time of Arrival: 11:54 PM

Location: Room 12, Sir Sleep-a-Lot Motel, Yellow Smoke County

Reporting Officer: Detective Arthur Graham, Yellow Smoke County Police Department

Victim name: John Doe (Name yet to be confirmed through fingerprint or DNA)

Gender: male

Age: estimated to be mid-40s

Occupation: unknown

Suspects: none at present

The victim checked into the ‚ÄòSir Sleep-a-Lot‚Äô Motel on the morning of November 25th, 2018. He informed the motel owner, Mr. John Kelly, that he would be staying for three days. No known associates or visitors during the stay.

Victim was found laying on bed in supine position. Victim had skin removed crudely. Patches of flesh hang loosely, revealing bone in some areas. Teeth indents on right part of pelvic bone will be examined. The victim's head is absent from the scene. Notably, the body had been dressed in what appeared to be women‚Äôs undergarments, specifically a pair of lace stockings and a torn satin slip. Neither items of clothing belonged to the victim. The body was likely dressed post-mortem.

Addendum: Marks on right part of pelvic bone were positively identified as being from a human juvenile, estimated as between the ages of three and six. No dental record have been traced.

Blood covers every inch of the room's four walls and carpet. The blood spray appears to be inconsistent with splatter from traumatic injury, possible use of pressurised device. The amount of blood was determined to be approximately two gallons, or 135% of the victim's total volume.

Teeth were found on the room's desk, thirty-three in total arranged into a circular pattern ten inches in diameter. The careful arrangement appears to be ritualistic. The teeth are currently assumed to have been belonging to the victim. The location of the victim's head has not been identified.

Addendum: The findings of the forensic odontologist have determined that thirty-two of the thirty-three teeth belonged to a person matching the victim's description; a caucasian male in his forties. One of the teeth matches a younger caucasian female. It was eventually connected through dental records to be from twenty-four year old Alyssa Hadland, reported missing in 1997. The Hadland case was archived in 1999 due to absence of evidence.

The victim‚Äôs tongue was discovered in the bathroom sink, exhibiting a complete severance at the base. The incision appeared clean and precise, suggesting the use of a surgical-grade or extremely sharp cutting instrument. Notably, the tongue was found in isolation within the sink, devoid of any other biological material, indicating that it may have been intentionally relocated post-excision.

First responders noted signs of tampering on the coin-operated television in the room, which intermittently activated to static approximately once an hour. The television will be deconstructed for forensic examination to recover latent fingerprints and other trace evidence related to its manipulation.

Addendum: Both of the victim's eyes were recovered from the interior of the room's coin-operated television. The television screen had been removed and the eyes were placed within the cavity where the cathode ray tube was situated. This positioning suggests deliberate placement, indicating a possible symbolic motive.

The only item of clothing found at the scene belonging to the victim was one pair of denim jeans, which witness John Kelly recalls being worn by the victim the morning he checked in. The jeans were contaminated with the victim's blood. In the pockets were found a one-way bus ticket from the towns of Cosgrave to Mayor's Income, one packet of apple flavoured gum and a button. No other possessions of the victim were found. A pair of small, leather lace-up shoes were found at the foot of the bed. From the lack of blood stains, we can assume the shoes were placed there after the homicide.

Addendum A: A shirt likely belonging to the victim was found three weeks later partially buried in a field in San Tommaso, a small town 240 miles south of Yellow smoke. The shirt matched the description given by John Kelly of the victim. Blood samples taken from the shirt were a strong match to those taken from the crime scene, although without the identity of the victim a definitive link is challenging to corroborate.

Addendum B: The small shoes found at the crime scene were dated to 1909 and determined to have some value among antique dealers. Due to their small size they can be assumed to be children's shoes.

The room showed no obvious signs of damage. The furniture appeared to have been undisturbed although a Bible was missing from the bedside cabinet. Neither John Kelly nor his son David, lead witnesses of the case, recall seeing the victim with any luggage. For this reason, it is unclear if his possessions were taken or if he simply had none to begin with. The motive of this homicide remains unclear.

I'll save you the rest of the procedural formalities. I've lost track of how many nights I've spent awake, staring at my computer screen reading and rereading this report. It's stayed with me for the past six years, constantly at the back of mind. At my personal behest, the case remained open despite insufficient evidence and a complete lack of any leads. When it was finally shelved at the beginning of this year, they were no closer to solving it than we were the day we found him.

Earlier this week, I learnt that it had been reopened by the FBI. I assumed that there must be someone else in this department who felt the same way about the case as I did, strong enough to reach out and request assistance from the feds. I was tasked with compiling any and all digital evidence we had on the case onto a USB flash.

I felt weird combing through all the reports, files and forensics. It felt like I was visiting an old friend. I added the documents I wrote up on the day, the dozens of crime scene photos and witness statements. I've studied them all meticulously myself. I doubted some Yale boy with a corner office could do any better.

I kept trailing through the earmarked files, checking and double checking if there was anything I'd missed. It was dark now. I spent the day working from home, hunched over my computer in my sorry excuse for a library. That's what my job mostly consists of now. I couldn't wait for retirement. Maybe then I would have the time to read some of these books I have lying around.

I decided I was finished for the night. I'd squeezed every piece of relevant information I could find onto that hard drive. It was up to the FBI now. I only hoped that if our victim left any family behind, they could one day get some closure from this. I was about to shut my computer down when something caught my eye.

Witness_1.mp3

It was an audio file. Somehow I hadn't noticed it before. Hell, I don't think I had even listened to it before. To my knowledge, all the Witness statements taken that night were written. I clicked on it, figuring it must've been taken from David Kelly, the kid who'd found the body.

I took a sip of my last dregs of coffee and sat back in my chair, jacking up the volume. The audio wasn't the best quality. It was shrouded in the static of an analogue recording and to my shock, the supposed ‚Äò1st witness‚Äô had a woman's voice. The following is a transcript of what was on that file.

First responder: ""What were you doing in the area before you discovered the body?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúI'm staying in Room 14, the room next door to where it happened. Been there for the past two weeks, thereabouts. I've come on hard times recently, you know how it is. I was living out of a van until this, but it wasn't exactly reliable.‚Äù

First responder: Apologies ma'am, I meant what were you doing immediately before discovering the body.

Witness 1: Right‚Ä¶ Well, I came back from work around nine. I clean at the elementary school in town. I came back and spent the rest of the day in my room. I had dinner and I was just catching up with the news before I went to sleep.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you describe how and when you found the body?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúGee, it must've been around ten. I was turning in for the night when I heard a banging noise from next door. I guessed he must've brought a lady friend over so I tried my best to ignore it, but it kept getting louder. It didn't sound like a headboard neither, more like someone chopping wood. It was too much for me to ignore so I got up to go complain. I found the door unlocked and it opened wide up when I knocked. That's when I saw him that poor, poor man.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCould you please describe the scene you came across as detailed as you can?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúIt was terrible, just terrible. I saw my neighbour kneeling in the corner of his room. His head had been cut off! Can you imagine that? There was blood covering everything around him. I almost vomited there and then. Then I saw the man in the bathroom.‚Äù

there's a pause

First responder: ‚ÄúCould you please go on? You said there was someone else at the scene?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ a real weirdo. I didn't notice him at first. He was just peeking out from behind the bathroom door, watching me. When I did finally notice him, we just stared at each other for a moment or two. Then he just strolled out from his little hiding place.‚Äù

another pause

First responder: ‚ÄúPlease continue, I assure you everything you have to say will be of some importance to our investigation. Start by describing this man you saw.‚Äù

Witness 1: OK then. He was a freak, I'll say it. When I got a good look at him I saw that he had this great bulbous head. He was bald as a newborn and the entire back part of his head was all deformed and sagging down. I think he had this disease. Oh what's it called? A boy I went to school with had it‚Ä¶‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAre you thinking of hydrocephalus?‚Äù

Witness 1: Yes! Yeah, that's it. Hydrocephalus. But it was much worse than that kid I knew. Sorry if i'm coming across as rude but It looked like some horrible octopus. And the front part of his head was far too thin. He has this pointy chin and cheekbones. His eyes were as bulging as his skull. All yellow and white, I think he had cataracts. Oh, and he must've been around seven feet tall, at least. He was hunching over where he met the ceiling.

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you describe what he was wearing?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ he had this battered old duster coat on. It was black, but he was covered in these stitched rags of red and green. The coat hung down to the floor, but I could make out the tips of brown leather boots poking out from the hem.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you-‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh! Pardon my interrupting, but the man, he was holding this‚Ä¶ Well I don't know what it was. It looked like a lobster pot with a handle and must be two dozen blades sticking out of it. Knives mostly, and razor blades, axe heads, chains, that sort of stuff. Anyway, go on.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúRight. What did you do when he came closer to you?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúWell I ran. I just ran. Out of the motel and down the road until I realised everything I owned was in my room. I didn't fancy having to start over from nothing for a third time so I came back, and that's when you bumped into me.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAlright, and how long was it from discovering the body until you called 911?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh I didn't call 911, honey.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ didn't?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh no, by the time I came back from my little jog the place was already crawling with police. I still haven't been allowed back in my room.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAre you aware that-‚Äù

I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I‚Äôm too big a LotR nerd.

**Moms**, when you think of¬†**Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the¬†***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.¬† But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes,¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was secretly a¬†***business mastermind***?¬† That's right, and if you‚Äôre a¬†**mom**¬†looking to dominate the¬†**entrepreneurial world**, there‚Äôs one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that¬†**MJ magic**¬†into¬†**your empire**,¬†***‚ÄùMomPreneurs‚Äù***¬†a very serious well thought out¬†**business guide for moms**.¬†¬†

Yes, you read that right.¬† Forget the¬†***‚ÄôThriller‚Äô***¬†album; the real thriller was how¬†**MJ**¬†ran his¬†***business empire***¬†from¬†**Neverland**.¬† And what was¬†**his greatest secret**?¬† Multitasking ‚Äì something¬†**moms**¬†have been doing since the dawn of time.¬† He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings,¬†*(probably)*.¬†¬†

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ**¬†wasn‚Äôt just the¬†***King of Pop***¬†‚Äì he was the¬†***Smooth Criminal***¬†of branding.¬† Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?¬† He wore ONE glove.¬† Genius.¬† Just like that,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it‚Äôll leave your competition asking,¬†***‚ÄúAnnie, are you okay?‚Äù***¬†¬†

**Moms,**¬†you don‚Äôt need to be the best at¬†***everything***; you just need to be memorable¬†***in your business niche.***¬† And hey, who better to teach you that than¬†**Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?¬†¬†

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland***¬†wasn‚Äôt just a place for frolicking around with¬†**Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was¬†**Michael‚Äôs**¬†dream world.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of¬†**Neverland**¬†‚Äì a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that‚Äôs your thing).¬†¬†**MJ**¬†knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you‚Äôll do the same ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a¬†***mom-run empire***¬†from your kitchen table. ¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of**¬†***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn‚Äôt just an accessory but a statement?¬† Well, in¬†***MomPreneurs***, you‚Äôll learn how to create your own ‚Äúglove moment‚Äù in the¬†**business world**.¬† Every¬†**successful entrepreneur**¬†has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.¬†¬†**Your business**¬†needs a ‚Äúglove‚Äù ‚Äì and no, it doesn‚Äôt have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be¬†***fabulous***.¬† Whether it‚Äôs a signature service, product, or your personal flair,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will help you find it.¬†¬†

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you‚Äôre a man) of Your Business**

Much like¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was crowned the¬†***King of Pop***,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to become¬†**the Queen of your business.**¬† Don‚Äôt let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.¬† In fact, if¬†***Michael Jackson***¬†could write¬†***Billie Jean***¬†while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can¬†**build a six-figure business**¬†while managing playdates.¬†¬†

So, do you want to learn¬†***MJ‚Äôs real secrets***¬†**to success**¬†and apply them to your¬†***MomPreneur***¬†journey?¬† Then grab a copy of¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†today.¬† It might not teach you how to¬†***Moonwalk***, but it¬†***will***¬†teach you how to hustle like the¬†***King of Pop***.¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

***\*Disclaimer:***¬†*While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.¬† However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.¬† But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

- power, water, internet.. fluctuating lagi masisira appliances ko then ang water minsan marumi ang net konting hangin wala na 

- commuting, ang mahal ng tricy sila pa galit pag magreklamo ka mas mura pa fair ng boat going to basilan and bus going to province. 

- cost of living, parang ang mahal dito (comparing to salary rate here in the city) sometimes when i check for prices mas mura pa mag lazada or shopee including the shipping, kaysa dito the price its not close really far. parang ang taas mag mark up and i do understand also the businesses ang taas ng overhead ng item dito

- driving, grabe ang counterflow normal na lang alam may salubong ikaw pa magadjust para di lang mabangga kahit wala na sila sa lane nila.. and if sabihan mo galit pa parang ang hirap ng discipline dito ng people for the city to progress if attitude will not change.. 

And by observing our culture here just notice this recently

- food, is it me or people here doesnt explore new cuisine, i saw some restaurants here fail because of their cuisine too complex.. here basta chicken wings no pork buhay ka tapos presyo sobra baba magtataka ka din sa store paano kumikita atleast advantage pag kakain abot kaya ng budget.. yehh almost all restaurant same yung menu nila not like sa other cities like davao or cebu wide variety na ang food hinde nakakasawa same menu.. i think people here doesnt like to risk their money too try new dishes kung saan comfortable sila and within their comfortzone dun sila. And if trending sila after a few months mahina na sila like di na binalikan ng tao its just a one time to eat at the resto. 

- businesses, i also notice here if what business is doing good or trending people copy like coffee shop and inasal chicken or wings, lahat gagaya not just franchising and also local versions of it and pop up booths will also show up along the road.. then overly saturated na sila.. i guess its like that business competitions.

...*<smiles softly>*... You know, I find it funny how everything always comes back to balance. ...*<sits back with coffee>*...

Take hedonism; seeking pleasure and happiness first and foremost. Sounds really good and, to be honest, quite tempting. And yet, if we let ourselves go completely, our hedonistic actions may actually work against  it.

...*<thinks>*... Okay, take eating. If you *only* go for pleasure, you may create a health situation which is *not* pleasant. Or, if we overindulgence in certain recreational drugs, we may cut our life span short -- which means we *shorten* the hedonistic experience. Neither are what we had in mind.

And so, here too, we have to strike a balance. Walk the middle path. Not too much, not too little.

What do you think?

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

I use to do a lot of comedy in the city. Would write my own sketch shows and produce/be in them. Some of the best times of my life. I'm currently working on a short horror movie script to hopefully film and enter in film fest next year. I'm a creative guy. Guarantee l'd find us the best dates.

I'm looking for my other half at this point. Someone who can push me to be the best version of myself, and someone I can do the same for. Someone who I can laugh with, take trips with and just enjoy the little things.

You are talking and getting along when the  topic of ‚Äúwhat do you do for fun‚Äù comes up. They mention video games as one of several things they enjoy. They probably aren‚Äôt a 16 hours a day type given the fact that you met them out in public doing something that wasn‚Äôt gaming.

Would you think any less of them because of it and be less likely to continue the friendship or relationship?

Would you try to convince them to stop playing, give them advice on how to quit, and tell them how it changed your life?

Do you set a boundary that gaming isn‚Äôt a common interest that you do or talk about together because it could lead to relapse? They can game on their personal time, you just don‚Äôt want anything to do with it.

Basically a month back I accidentally ordered coarse grind roasted coffee from coffeeza instead of my normal instant coffee. Yesterday I ordered a moka pot after doing some research by which I mean that all I know is you can't dissolve this kind of coffee in milk like instant milk and that there are different methods for brewing it. So yesterday I put milk in the lower compartment of the pot (I don't think you are supposed to) and coffee in the upper one after it boiled on stove I mixed sugar and drank it, tasted nice ig. Today I watched a 3 min video about all this shit and made another coffee (also the lower compartment was greasy smelled after regular washing so i had to soak it in hot soap water). I boiled the water in a kettle because the video said that if I put cold water in the lower compartment it will take longtime to boil which will cook the coffee and make it bitter. So Iputb boiled water in there and coffee in the filter type shit. After it finished cooking/brewing/boiling whatever it is, I mixed warm milk which I tried to froth in a mixi blender, I added sugar and tasted it. It tasted weird and very watery and overall not the greatest like it wasn't total undrinkable but not nice at all, did have some taste of normal milk coffee I drink but yep not good. 
Was it supposed to taste like this? 
What things did I do wrong? 
Please give general advice too as a newbie in the coffee world. 
How else can I make it and what methods are there overall?
I'm a teen and have been drinking instant coffee (nescafe) for a long time after which I switched more expensive brands like sleepy owl but still instant coffee.

## Quick Summary

I've tried plenty of weight loss supplements, so I know my way around these things. LeanBean has a good lineup of ingredients, and while it won‚Äôt work miracles, it can be a solid addition if you're already on the right path with diet and exercise. I‚Äôd rate it at 3.5 / 5.

If you‚Äôre weighing your options, I recommend [**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) (3000 mg glucomannan, best non stimulant fat burner) and [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq2.php) (More focus on thyroid, multiple angles of appetite suppression & weight loss, blood sugar management) over **LeanBean**, both rated at **4.5 / 5**.

**Where LeanBean helps:**

The **glucomannan** is a standout ingredient. This is a natural fiber from konjac root that swells in your stomach, making you feel fuller, so you naturally eat less. I've personally used glucomannan before, and it really helped curb my hunger when I was trying to cut down on snacking. But keep in mind, it‚Äôs not magic‚Äîif you‚Äôre not eating right, you‚Äôll still struggle.

If you‚Äôve got a lifestyle in place where you‚Äôre eating in a calorie deficit, this can help make that process easier. Plus, the studies support that glucomannan, combined with a proper diet, can lead to weight loss‚Äã.

Then there‚Äôs **green coffee bean extract**. It‚Äôs got chlorogenic acid, which is thought to reduce fat absorption and improve how your body uses glucose. It‚Äôs not super strong, but it might give you a slight edge when it comes to metabolism. Again, this is one of those ingredients that can provide a _small_ boost, but it‚Äôs not going to make the pounds melt off unless you're putting in the effort‚Äã with workouts etc.

I‚Äôve also seen **turmeric** popping up in a lot of supplements lately, probably because of its anti-inflammatory properties. It‚Äôs not directly related to weight loss, but it can help if inflammation has been holding you back in terms of recovery or metabolism. If you're into holistic health, turmeric could be a nice bonus.

**Where it‚Äôs lacking:**

LeanBean markets itself toward women, but there‚Äôs not much here that‚Äôs specifically gender-focused. **Garcinia Cambogia** is one of those ingredients I‚Äôve tried in the past and honestly didn‚Äôt see much difference. It‚Äôs supposed to block fat production, but most of the hype around it is pretty inflated. I wouldn‚Äôt rely on it too much if you're looking for a major fat-burning effect

The dose of **green coffee bean** and **turmeric** here is also on the lower side. Based on what I‚Äôve read and seen, these doses are more about supporting your overall wellness rather than directly causing significant weight loss.

**Acai berry** is nice for antioxidants, but at 6.67 mg, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúfiller‚Äù than a powerhouse ingredient.

Overall, if you're looking for a natural supplement to _help_ you stay on track, LeanBean might be worth a shot, but don't expect miracles. I‚Äôd rate it about 3.5 out of 5. It‚Äôs good for suppressing appetite and giving you some energy to stay motivated, but it won‚Äôt replace a solid workout routine and proper diet.

If you're considering this, just know that your results will still mostly depend on the work you put in.

**What I recommend**

If you‚Äôre weighing your options, I‚Äôd recommend giving HourGlass Fit or PhenQ a shot over LeanBean.

[**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) stands out as the one of the best non-stimulant fat burners, thanks to its whopping **3000 mg of glucomannan**, which helps control hunger better than LeanBean's dose. It‚Äôs perfect if you want something effective without the jitters.

On the other hand, [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq2.php) takes a more well-rounded approach, targeting multiple angles of weight loss, including boosting thyroid function and managing blood sugar, which can help with energy levels and fat burning.

Both of these options are more powerful, offering more comprehensive benefits than LeanBean, and I‚Äôd give them a solid 4.5 out of 5.

**Pros of LeanBean:**

- **Natural appetite suppressant**: Uses **glucomannan**, a fiber that swells in your stomach to help control cravings and keep you feeling full longer.
- **Non-stimulant**: No jittery caffeine crashes, making it ideal for people sensitive to stimulants.
- **Tailored for women**: Specifically designed to target cravings and support metabolism in women, which can help with long-term weight management.
- **Energy support without overstimulation**: Contains ingredients like turmeric and green coffee bean extract that support metabolism without overloading your system.
- **Vegan-friendly**: Made with all-natural, plant-based ingredients, suitable for a wide range of dietary preferences.
- **Money-back guarantee**: 90-day money-back guarantee, offering a risk-free trial period.

**Cons of LeanBean:**

- **Low dosage of some ingredients**: Ingredients like **turmeric** and **green coffee bean extract** are present in low amounts, which may limit their fat-burning potential.
- **Glucomannan-dependent**: While glucomannan is effective, results largely depend on how well your body responds to this fiber.
- **Limited fat-burning impact**: Doesn't contain strong thermogenic ingredients, which may not be ideal if you're looking for rapid fat burning.
- **Requires consistent use with diet**: Works best when combined with a calorie-controlled diet and regular exercise; it won‚Äôt work alone.
- **Not a miracle solution**: Like most natural fat burners, it won‚Äôt replace a healthy lifestyle‚Äîdiet and exercise remain crucial for results.

## How to use appetite suppressants like LeanBean, Hourglass Fit, PhenQ

If you're trying to lose weight using appetite suppressants like LeanBean, HourGlass Fit, or PhenQ, there are a few key tips to make them work for you. First, focus on eating high-protein meals and avoiding simple carbs, which can cause blood sugar spikes and make it harder to control your hunger.

These supplements, especially with ingredients like glucomannan, help you feel full, but you'll need to combine them with a diet rich in protein and vegetables to maximize their effectiveness. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is crucial too, as sometimes hunger is actually thirst.

It's also a good idea to **try intermittent fasting** or **reducing your caloric intake** in the morning, allowing you to save more calories for the evening, which can prevent **late-night snacking.** Supplements like these can be more effective when paired with a consistent routine that includes daily activity, whether it‚Äôs intentional cardio or simply walking more.

For extra appetite control, consider adding fiber powder before meals or even using stimulants like caffeine in moderation to suppress hunger and boost energy‚Äã

1. **LeanBean** versus **PhenQ**

- In contrast, **PhenQ** targets weight loss from multiple angles: it boosts metabolism, supports **thyroid health**, and helps regulate **blood sugar levels**, making it a broader solution. PhenQ includes ingredients like **Œ±-Lacys Reset** to promote thermogenesis and fat burning, while also working on **fat storage reduction** and **energy enhancement**.

2. **LeanBean** versus **InstantKnockout**

- **LeanBean** focuses on women, using a **1000 mg dose of Glucomannan** to control appetite, alongside natural, low-stimulant ingredients like **Green Coffee Bean** for energy without the jitters.
- **Instant Knockout**, originally designed for athletes, combines a higher **1800 mg Glucomannan dose** with a powerful **300 mg of caffeine**, providing a stronger energy boost and fat-burning potential. While LeanBean is ideal for those seeking a gentle, stimulant-free approach, **Instant Knockout** offers a more intense fat-burning solution for high-energy users.

3. **LeanBean** versus **Capsiplex**

- **LeanBean** is a low-stimulant option designed for women, relying on **natural ingredients** like **Glucomannan** and **Green Coffee Bean** to suppress appetite and boost metabolism without heavy reliance on stimulants.

- **LeanBean** contains **1000 mg of Glucomannan** along with appetite-suppressing and metabolism-boosting ingredients like **Green Coffee Bean** and **Turmeric**, focusing on steady energy and natural weight loss.

- On the other hand, **Burn Lab Pro** is ideal for workout enthusiasts, featuring **1500 mg HMB**, **375 mg Forslean**, and **75 mg Capsimax**, which support **fat loss** while **preserving muscle** and boosting performance. If you're looking for a fat burner for workouts, **Burn Lab Pro** offers stronger exercise-related benefits.

## Risks and Side Effects of LeanBean

While **LeanBean** is marketed as a natural, low-stimulant fat burner, it‚Äôs important to be aware of potential risks and side effects, especially if you have specific sensitivities or conditions.

- The main ingredient, **Glucomannan**, is a natural fiber that can sometimes cause **digestive issues** such as bloating, gas, or discomfort if taken without sufficient water. It‚Äôs essential to stay hydrated when using LeanBean to avoid any unwanted digestive effects.
- Though LeanBean is designed to be **gentle**, some people might experience minor side effects from ingredients like **Green Coffee Bean Extract**, which still contains small amounts of caffeine. While it‚Äôs not a high-caffeine product, those who are particularly sensitive to stimulants may feel **slight** **restlessness**.
- LeanBean is generally well-tolerated, but if you have a history of **digestive problems** or **food sensitivities**, it‚Äôs a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before starting.

Overall, LeanBean‚Äôs **all-natural formula** minimizes the risk of harsh side effects, but like any supplement, it‚Äôs essential to use it correctly and monitor how your body reacts.

I am a 22-year-old girl, and my male friend, who‚Äôs about to turn 23, and I have grown close overtime and have strong feeling for each other. Although we live in different countries due to school, we‚Äôve met up for coffee when we‚Äôre in the same city. We both want to marry each other and are committed to doing things the halal way (our parents do know about our interest in being potential spouses but it‚Äôs not super serious). University and finances are our only obstacles right now so we decided to remain friends with the intention of marriage until we are in a place in our lives to actually do so.

When we first discussed marriage, he mentioned that if I had a past, he‚Äôd rather not know, but it would be a dealbreaker if I was not a virgin as he has preserved his own chastity and never been close to a girl before. Until I was 20, I had never been close to a guy. Then, a friend introduced me to someone and it quickly turned into a haram relationship. I felt pressured into dating because ‚Äúfriends‚Äù would comment that I was ‚Äúbehind‚Äù and should get some experience. I was a bit of a people pleaser so I ended up being with him for about 2 months, we kissed a few times, but I never enjoyed being with him and felt guilty afterward. I take full responsibility for my actions, I feel ashamed and have repented every night since then. 

Recently, when discussing dealbreakers again, he mentioned that if I had done anything with another guy at all, he would most likely end things and maybe cut me off. 

I believed that if someone truly repented and quit that sin, their past wouldn‚Äôt matter. But I‚Äôve started seeing posts mentioning if someone has done something that‚Äôs on another‚Äôs list of dealbreakers, they should end things but make an excuse as to not reveal the sin.

I‚Äôm conflicted. I want to be with him, we have both never felt this way about anyone, and I know me leaving would hurt us both. But I don‚Äôt want to do anything that might upset Allah or lead to something worse if we do end up together. I don‚Äôt know if this situation is a punishment, a lesson, a test, but I want to make the right choice that‚Äôs best for us both.

I‚Äôm working hard to strengthen my relationship with Allah and become a better Muslim. Am I in denial, should I just end our friendship now? Any advice on how to proceed would be deeply appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1730204956.0,SistersInSunnah,0,1.0,False

Some of you may have heard of me in the past, my name is Clement and I am the guy behind [Oversliders Drift Works. ](https://www.instagram.com/clement_oversliders/)

Over the years in the hobby, I have created a lot of 3D printed parts for all types of chassis, specifically weight shift systems. 

[Yokomo YD2 Weight Shift Frame System](https://preview.redd.it/lu70qxketoxd1.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b07f5fb7c805cbfdaa70b6af42098a09931a7fce)

After taking a hiatus for a few years, I have upgraded my printers and I am now back in the hobby. 

My first goal is going to put all my models available for you to download through my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Oversliders?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink). All my previous existing models will be free to access and print and you are free to buy me a coffee if you appreciate the work.   
  
I also have been tinkering on launching an ""open RC"" chassis which I will start work on as soon as all my old models are up on the Patreon. The idea is that if you have a printer, you can basically print (almost) your entire chassis and go drift.   
  
For those who do not have printers and would like some of my parts, you can reach out to me via either [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Oversliders?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink) or my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clement_oversliders/), and I can commission the prints for you. Luckily, with today's printing technology, the quality of my prints has increased drastically, so for those who remember my products, be ready for much smoother and nicer products.   
  
I look forward to interacting with you all and getting some sideways action.

I use topical Minoxidil, my hair grows but then it falls out.

I've done all the tests possible (to the knowledge of my doctors). It's not iron deficiency, it's not alopecia, it's not hormones, it's not thyroid. 

Today my doctor looked at my, once again, perfect blood test results and said that the last guess is my medication. 

I take wellbutrin and ritalin. When I look at the timeline of my hair, I can notice how my hair started thinning after I started taking ritalin. I dismissed this because this side effect is listed as very rare and I wanted to rule out all the obvious options before I jump to quitting my meds.

Has anyone experienced their hair growing back after stopping these meds? I have some other unexplained symptoms like sweating, fatigue, heart palpitations after drinking coffee and some other stuff. These sound like the typical adhd medication side effects, so I am considering stopping my meds.

It does suck, because I don't want to give away the positive effects. But man, my confidence has plummeted.

Symptoms are loose stools/diarrhea but only in the mornings. Also lots of gas which is usually getting worse in the evening. If i have to poop in the evening, then the stool is firm but usually pretty thin. 

I have lately been more anxious about this and for some reason looked at my poop with my phones flashlight. I noticed that there is a slight oily looking film on the toilet water every time after loose stool. Doesn't really happen with the more firm stool. So the question is, is this normal or should i be super concerned about this? Can ibs-d people check if you have this also when you have looser stool :D? 

I have been battling with serious health anxiety for all of my adult life and it feels that i always have something and now ofcourse this feels a new super big worry in my mind. I quess my fear is i have pancreatic insufficiency (epi). 

Edit: more info, the stool usually sinks, sometimes floats for a while and then sinks. I guess its about air in the poop. The film looks similar than what a cup of black coffee has on it",1,1730204541.0,ibs,1,1.0,False

Gf said she deleted all her dating apps once we started dating. Which i believe is true(atleast on her phone) 

We been dating about 8 months. Slept at her place, she woke up and left to work. She left the house keys for me to lock up for when i leave.

Saw her ipad, was curious and looked at it. The ipad is locked and i didn‚Äôt know the code but i saw siri suggestions. It suggested the dating app Coffee meet bagel. Although idk her passcode i was able to type and search for other apps. I found she also had bumble and hinge

I made a fake account on bumble and hinge to see if i can find her. Put filters on to narrow my search for her age, and miles. Ran out of profiles and couldn‚Äôt find her. Didn‚Äôt check coffee meet bagel

it also aggrevates my fibro pain.
I take vitamins, eat healthy, work out,...  

I am a bit fed up right now. 
so this post is to rant... and maybe ask if you have some special thing to help you in those cases? I take anti inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin), nose spray, lozenges for throat pain, chicken soup, balm to put on skin, coffee, pro biotics, vitamins, minerals, colostrum powder, ...

I feel great and don't hate the mirror anymore. :) I am noticing a change in my daily numbers the past couple of weeks. I still have the dawn effect, and my overnight numbers could be a bit better. My days are going like this now. 

Overnight I am mostly just above 100 or a bit below until I start to wake up around 4am. Really depends if I eat my after dinner almonds or cashews. I'm addicted.

Morning dawn effect hits me pretty quickly to about 120 to maybe 130 after morning coffee with half and half. I only hit it for minutes and it settles down to 110 to less than 120 very quickly.

By mid-morning or noon I am below 100, but the change now is I get into the 80's to high 70's until I eat dinner. That's new for me. Getting into the 80's and 70's 

Most the time if I eat something that pushes me to 140 or 150 (not very often unless I'm testing a food to see what it does to me) I hit it only for minutes and then drop below120.

I see an endo for the first time tomorrow and today I seem my regular doc about my weight loss and will get an  in office A1c test. Hoping I'm still at 5.5.

Back to the 80's. When my glucose drops I get anxiety just seeing it drop. What number do you decide it's time to correct without waiting? ",2,1730204025.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

I'm British but Ive been based overseas for almost 20 years. When I'm in the UK I love old man pubs, walks, charity shops, cafes, local food etc.

I've booked a short break next month: one night in Boggle Hole and one night in York. All using public transport. This is my rough plan:

Day 1: am train to Scarborough. Anything to see or do there? I'll want a coffee at least. Bus to Robin Hoods Bay, mooch around there. Are there supermarkets there or should I stock up in Scarborough? (Staying in a hostel with a kitchen plus I want packed lunch things/snacks)

Day 2: coastal walk from boggle Hole to Whitby. Ive been to Whitby before and will be perfectly happy pottering around the shops and maybe having lunch at the magpie. Is there anywhere I could leave my bag so I don't have to carry it round all day?

Coastliner bus to York. I know it takes ages and I don't really mind.

Stay in York that evening, find a nice pub to spend some time at.

Day 3: nothing is fixed but I have a train home in the evening from Harrogate, so I'll need to get there (is bus or train best?) I've been to York before but it was during the pandemic so almost everything was closed. Id like to go to the railway museum and the tap pub in the station.
