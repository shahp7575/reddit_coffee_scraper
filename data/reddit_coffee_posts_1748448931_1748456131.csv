1kxo69j,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kxo69j/i_quit_starbucks_with_no_notice_no_backup_and_i/,"I quit Starbucks with no notice, no backup — and I don’t regret it","When I got hired, the onboarding was a disaster — it took three whole months to sort out my clock-in issues, system access, and basic training. I was just tossed on the floor, figuring things out as I went as a rehire. Meanwhile, everyone’s attitude was garbage because of how poorly shifts were handed off and how certain SSVs weren’t pulling their weight, leaving the rest of us to clean up the mess.

The breaking point? I was scheduled on a family member’s birthday. I worked hard trying to get that shift covered before it hit me: why am I bending over backward for this place? I realized they didn’t deserve me or the work I provided. no amount of coffee, or green apron spirit could cover how bitter and drained I was becoming. I never answered anyone (ik that’s bad) but I didn’t even feel the need to, just drained.

I was only working four or five short shifts a week, but even that had me so anxious I was vomiting before shifts, mentally psyching myself up to deal with a senior partner who openly did 25% of the job, blocked up the workflow, and was passively mean-spirited on top of it. 

I walked away with no notice, no backup, just the clarity that I deserve better — and now I have strong leads for two back-of-house retail roles paying $2 more an hour.

If you’re sitting there questioning whether you should stay at a job that’s draining you dry, making you anxious, and killing your spirit: I’m here to tell you, sometimes quitting is the reset you need.

No regrets.

Hello. While driving to work today, I pulled into the coffee shop to grab my coffee. I turned into the parking space kind of quickly and it almost felt like it was going to die for a split second. I left the car running because my husband was in there, came back and we headed towards work. As soon as I got to the first red light and was idling, the car was idling pretty rough. Asked my husband if he felt it, and he said felt normal to him. Kept driving and came to a stop for traffic and when I went to drive, the car wouldn’t move. All the dash lights and radio were on, but I couldn’t move. The battery, oil, and engine lights came on. I put the car in park, back into drive, nothing. Put into park, shut off, turned on, and then I could drive. Anytime I came to a stop or a slow roll, the same thing would happen. I had to get us both to work so I kept trying to cruise, avoiding stopping as much as possible. I dropped him off and turned the car off for about a min. I started it back up and drove the 2 miles to my work, stopping about 10 times and it didn’t happen again. I got to my parking garage, placed it in park, and let it idle for about 10 min and it’s running completely normal. It’s not shutting off and the idling is smooth. 

I am SO confused. AI is saying that it could be a few things, but before I go out and spend all this money trying to get this fixed, can anyone give me some insight on what could be happening?

Knowing a little bit about cars, I have a theory, but I don’t even know if it’s plausible. Gear slipped when pulled into parking space and braked too fast. When idling, it wasn’t in the right gear so it would stall. I don’t know if that sounds possible or crazy 🤣",1,1748455900.0,MechanicAdvice,1,1.0,False

Turrns out starting your day by cramming random internet garbage into your head isn't great for focus. who knew?

So i tried something different. not some crazy routine, just basic stuff to help my brain actually function:

* keep my phone in the bathroom so i have to get up to turn off the alarm
* splash cold water on my face (sounds dumb but it works)
* eat an apple or banana before coffee (stops the jittery feeling)
* look outside for like 30 seconds (natural light helps wake you up apparently)
* write down the ONE assignment i absolutely have to finish that day
* do some neck rolls and shoulder shrugs (helps with all the computer hunching)
* make my bed (gives me one win before the day starts)

nothing fancy. no meditation apps or journaling for an hour. just treating my brain like it needs a few minutes to boot up instead of immediately overloading it.

the difference is wild. my first study session used to feel like trying to read underwater. now i can actually focus without fighting my own attention span for 20 minutes.

I just thought I’d share my experience of a cerclage which I just had today on the NHS in the UK (state healthcare system). Hopefully it will be useful and reassuring for those who are considering.

1. Had my 12 week scan and had an appointment with a consultant afterwards. In my case I had a previous preterm birth and damage to my cervix during a late stage c-section for my daughter. Surgeon at the time said I’d need a stitch in my next pregnancy. Consultant initially wanted to try watch and wait and carrying out a cervical scan every two weeks. I pushed for cerclage and they booked it.

2. They booked an appointment for today (Wednesday) and I am 15w5d.

3. A midwife called me on Monday to talk pre-op advice and gave me the time of the cerclage.

4. An anaesthetist called me to talk me through the spinal block. Very kind and reassuring.

5. I was not allowed to eat from 6AM today, but I was allowed to drink clear, flat liquid (water, black tea or coffee or squash).

5. Arrived 11AM today and was sent to three different places until we got the right one 🤣 I was then taken to a waiting room, given scrubs and stockings (not sexy ones) to get ready. The surgeon came to see me and talked through the procedure.

6. I arrived in theatre at 13:30. 

7. The anaesthetist came and numbed my back and inserted the spinal block which numbed me to just below my boobies. It worked very quickly and was painless. He gave me local anaesthetic before putting the spinal in.

8. They put my legs in stirrups (which made me laugh hysterically as I couldn’t feel my legs and kind of disassociated from them, it looked like they were throwing around a pair of fake legs 🤣)

9. The procedure took about 20 mins and I felt NOTHING no pressure or anything. Just felt like someone kept pushing me up the bed. Once all was done, the very kind surgeon debriefed me and explained everything in detail which I appreciated a lot.

10. My blood pressure spiked but that was controlled by the anaesthetist. I did feel a bit wobbly and weird at points but that passed. I was also given antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection. 

11. I left theatre at 14:15.

11. I was sent for recovery then onto the ward. I had a pretty achey lower back and some cramping but paracetamol controlled it. They also gave me something a bit stronger too. 

12. I will be discharged around 21:00 this evening, they just want to check my pain levels before doing so. 

And that’s it, just enjoyed a healthy hospital dinner of potato and cheese bake with a side of roast potatoes and two lovely sugary cups of tea! Oh and the NHS toast and plenty of butter (if you know you know). 

Anyway, all of this to say it wasn’t so scary in the end. And a big thank you to the ladies in this community who have me advise to push for the cerclage. Please don’t hesitate to dm me with any questions ☺️

I’ll update on the rest of my journey as and when ❤️❤️

1kxnwvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/panamaexpats/comments/1kxnwvn/el_valle_de_antón_panamas_bestkept_secret_for/,El Valle de Antón: Panama’s Best-Kept Secret for Expats?,"When expats talk about where to live in Panama, El Valle de Antón often comes up as a peaceful, scenic alternative to the hustle of Panama City or the expat-heavy towns like Boquete. But is it just a weekend escape for city dwellers—or a viable long-term home for expats?

Here’s a deep dive into what life is really like in El Valle, who it’s best suited for, and what to expect if you’re thinking of making the move.

🧭 TL;DR
El Valle de Antón is a lush, cool-weather town nestled in the crater of an extinct volcano. It’s ideal for retirees, nature lovers, and anyone seeking a slower, more peaceful lifestyle. Expect stunning scenery, a small but welcoming community, and a strong connection to nature and local culture—but also limited services, slower internet, and a quieter social scene.

🌿 Why El Valle Appeals to Expats
Cooler climate – Temperatures range from the mid-60s to mid-70s °F year-round. No A/C needed.
Natural beauty – Surrounded by cloud forests, waterfalls, hiking trails, and exotic wildlife.
Relaxed lifestyle – Quiet, safe, and perfect for those looking to unplug.
Proximity to Panama City – Just 2–2.5 hours away by car, making it accessible for errands or weekend trips.
Small but active expat community – Regular meetups, yoga classes, and volunteer opportunities.
Eco-conscious vibe – Many residents are involved in conservation, gardening, and sustainable living.
🎉 Culture & Community Life
Though small, El Valle has a rich cultural identity rooted in nature, tradition, and community. It’s not a party town—but it’s far from boring.

El Valle Market – The town’s central market is a hub of activity, especially on weekends. You’ll find local produce, handmade crafts, orchids, and traditional Panamanian goods.
Festival de las Flores y del Café – Held in January, this flower and coffee festival celebrates the region’s biodiversity and agricultural heritage with music, food, and artisan stalls.
Semana Santa – Holy Week is observed with processions and community gatherings, blending religious tradition with local customs.
Artisan culture – The town is known for its handwoven baskets, carved tagua nuts, and locally made soaps and jewelry.
Outdoor lifestyle – Residents often gather for group hikes, birdwatching, or thermal spring visits. There’s also a growing wellness scene with yoga, massage, and holistic health offerings.
🏘️ Where Expats Tend to Live
Town Center – Walkable and close to shops, restaurants, and the market.
El Hato & La Reforma – More rural, with larger lots and mountain views.
Altos del Maria (nearby) – A gated mountain community about 30–40 minutes away, popular with expats seeking privacy and amenities.
💰 Cost of Living (Estimates)
Rent (1–2 BR home): $500–$1,000/month
Utilities: $50–$150/month (lower if no A/C is needed)
Dining out: $6–$15 per meal at local restaurants
Groceries: Local produce is cheap; imported goods are pricier
Transportation: No Uber; most people drive. Buses to Panama City are available and affordable
✅ Pros
Pleasant year-round weather
Stunning natural surroundings
Peaceful, safe, and community-oriented
Close enough to Panama City for convenience
Great for hiking, gardening, and outdoor living
Strong eco-conscious and wellness culture
❌ Cons
Limited healthcare (nearest major hospital is in Coronado or Panama City)
Fewer dining and entertainment options
Slower internet in some areas
Can feel isolated, especially during the rainy season
Not ideal for nightlife or fast-paced living
👥 Who It’s Best For
Retirees looking for peace, nature, and a mild climate
Nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts
Remote workers who don’t need ultra-fast internet
Families seeking a safe, small-town environment
Expats who want to integrate with locals and live simply
🧳 Final Thoughts
El Valle de Antón is a special place—lush, peaceful, and full of natural charm. It’s not for everyone, but for those who value tranquility, community, and cooler weather, it could be the perfect home base in Panama.

But, I did find a couple unique mugs at a yard sale and I'm uncertain how or where to price/sell them.

An old, out-of-business calculator company coffee mug. No ebay sales data in the tool. One on worthpoint. I am assuming that website is a database of older sales data than the ebay tool. I'm not signing up for something over one item.

A mustang ranch ""where quality keeps. . ."" coffee cup? There is some sales data for bigger mugs, tshirts, etc on eBay. Mine has a flared lip and is less volume than a regular coffee mug. Not sure what to do with this one. Cup? Mug? Does it matter? 

Anyway, what's your plan when you find somewhat unique things? General or specific to my objects advice is welcome.

1kxnpi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTArabs/comments/1kxnpi1/arab_guy_kinda_hurt_my_heart/,Arab guy kinda hurt my heart,"I met someone the other day from a dating app. An Arab guy from the gulf. By comparison, I am a 23 year old westerner. Our encounter was short and sexual, yet he left an impression in my mind. I didn’t fall in love, but I love all that he possesses: he is young, handsome, intrepid and full of vitality. He spoke about the things he enjoys with great enthusiasm, he is passionate about horse riding and his patriotism allowed him to share so many interesting facts about his country. He is gifted with friendship too. Somehow in his three months in my city, he has a network of friends, mostly Arab, that he did not know before, whereas I haven’t managed to make any friends in my two years here. When he sat with me, his phone constantly pinged, so many notifications from his friends. It seems that the cream of life is his, his horizon is broad and so many opportunities lie in wait. He is free and innocent, and already he is making a good start and is liked by so many. In him, I recognise things that are slipping away from my own life like spontaneity, joy, attention, and possibility. 

Now I wonder why he did not speak with me much after our meeting. What qualities did I lack? Could he sense my decay, that my youth is slipping away from me (I am a few years older so maybe I am being dramatic). Maybe he found me unattractive. Can you believe after I met him that I laid down on my bathroom floor and hysterically cried… I never cry. 

Maybe he didn’t see much of anything at all… not because I was not worthy, but because he wasn’t looking deep. People as radiant as he was often move quickly, skimming the hearts of delicate people like me.

I must admit I feel intrigued by Arabs. I see plenty in my city, yet I cannot access their circles. I see them gather in groups at coffee shops, like a pride of lions, loyal to each other. The conversations seem to flow effortlessly. What are they talking about I wonder? I sense the majority of them who sway towards homosexuality will never allow this to become a sentimental part of their life, only allowing fleeting discreet moments with guys like me 😭 

What do you guys think? You have similar experiences. Sorry I appreciate I am not Arab but this place felt like a good place to share",2,1748454838.0,LGBTArabs,1,1.0,False

1kxnoje,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1kxnoje/small_business_problems/,Small Business Problems,"Hi all,

I was wondering if you could me sound out some ideas. 

I own a small coffee shop that does well in summer and terrible in winter. I was thinking of selling bags of our coffee online to try and level out our sales throughout the year. As we are a small business we won't be as cheap as bigger companies and we would be looking at around £12 for 350g. It feels expensive but we can't afford to do it for any cheaper.

I am reaching out to air bnbs about buying items from us to make a welcome basket but haven't got any of them interested yet. Our shop is a bit remote, we're in a village of around 400 people, so tough to stay open.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

All the best

1kxno72,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafebrasil/comments/1kxno72/será_essa_a_melhor_opção_no_momento_na_minha/,Será essa a melhor opção no momento na minha situação?,"Do começo: nunca fui o apreciador de cafés, achava amargo, sempre colocava açúcar e era cerca de 90% leite, com muito pouco café. Até que descobri que existem diferenças para os cafés mais caros, não somente qualidade, mas gosto também. Não sou exatamente alguém com muita experiência, mas gosto muito de cappuccino (embora admita que eu faça daqueles caseiros e faça sempre com bastante leite e às vezes uma mistureba com iogurtes), já provei os cafés do lanche feliz lá (gostei do Moca Mix inclusive, mas é bem mistureba com chocolate, chantilly, mesmo), provei alguns do Mais1 café também (gostei de alguns, outros nem tanto). Agora, eu queria partir para cafés melhores, mas dar um passo de cada vez, principalmente considerando que atualmente o máximo que tenho é um coador normal. Com isso, atrelado com um cupom do ML que ganhei e armado com um vídeo do canal do Café Gerações sobre como fazer no coador comum, pensei em pegar os 3 cafés de 250g do Coffee++ com os sabores que prefiro (o tradicional, o arara e o último fica em dúvida entre o sul de minas e o caparaó). Queria opiniões se, visando a qualidade e tudo mais, é uma boa escolha para ""começar"" da forma que eu consigo. 

Para deixar anotado: pagaria 88 reais por juntar o valor deles + o frete (frete de supermercado só é de graça a partir de 199 no ML) - o cupom (considerando que eles são 10 reais mais baratos que no próprio site, mas obviamente devido à data de torrefação), e escolhi eles por uma questão preço + vídeos do Não sou barista (um que eles comparavam alguns em grãos dos que se acha no mercado e eles foram os melhores). Queria comprar pelas próprias torrefações (como da Astral com a questão do sub, mas juntando o cupom com o fato de ter só o coador normal, não sei se vale)",1,1748454751.0,cafebrasil,0,1.0,False

1kxnmmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxnmmz/i_27f_need_advice_and_help_in_this_mess/,I (27F) need advice and help in this mess,"Okay, I’ll start. This guy called Frank, I met him at Uni, in 2019. It’s 2025 and I’m 27 years old right now. I was born in April 18 of 1998. I think he is one or two years younger than me. 
He showed me interest by asking me out for drinks. I had a great time and I started liking him. But I noticed that he took a few hours before texting be back. I also discovered that he did hard drugs at the time - Weed, Ecstasy, Acid, mushrooms… and other things. 
That turned me off a bit, but not enough for me to stop seeing him. 
There came a point where I questioned him: “why do you take so much time to text me back?” To which he would reply “I have a ‘hands off’ approach when it comes to relationships”. And I didn’t quite understand that… 
Time passed, and I had sex with him. As a way to establish “more connection” with him. 
One time, when I asked him to hang out, he told me he couldn’t because his “turtle had died”. (He had a turtle as a pet). It turned me off, obviously. But I still kept trying.
He would always invite me over to his place (I met his parents). We always had sex. My dad would drive me to his house, and then he’d pick me up. Frank would never come and pick me up from my house. He didn’t have original “plans” for other outings. 
My parents wouldn’t allow me to stay the night at his house. Frank hated this.
I remember we went out for drinks one night. I asked him “What are we?” And I remember him getting so nervous, he had to take off his sweater. He was super nervous and he told me “I just go with the flow”. I didn’t know what to say.
One day, while we were having sex at his house, he was on top and I was at the bottom. He lightly slapped me, súper súper lightly. And then, he closed his fist, and at first he appeared to be about to hit me in the face, but then he didn’t. His face was angry, pressing his lips against each other, looking at me with kind-of crazy eyes. 
It wasn’t violent it was very subtle, and I didn’t react and we kept on having sex.
He never apologized for that. Because he saw nothing wrong with that. 
He never punched me in the face, but I saw that it was “about to happen”.
The day after I felt weird and isolated because he didn’t text me. 
He was living his life and I was “after him”, because I was in love with him.
There are positives: he would be romantic sometimes, he would hug me tightly, and he would be responsive with texts. And sweet. Cute, he would caress my face and make me feel warm. 
But he never asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend. He told me he “didn’t believe in labels”. 

Since 2016 I had social anxiety/social phobia. 
When I met this guy I saw it as a big achievement to go out on dates even though I was terrified of turning red. 
I had all these fears/insecurities inside of me. 
When I saw that this guy just wouldn’t go “official” with me, as in giving me a label of “girlfriend”, I was more and more anxious and I felt more and more insecure. 
I lost a lot of weight during this time because of all the stress.
And also I was showing up as someone “weak”, and he noticed that. 
I was timid, shy, and he seemed to dislike that. Maybe he thought I was “weird”. 
I should add that I am extremely attractive. I am a very good looking woman. I have blue eyes and I’m blonde. 

During December 2021, we were seeing each other more often. I really liked that. I remember going to a voice coach near his house one day, and I texted him “hey! We could see each other since I’m close to your house” (I remember being desperate to see him because he wouldn’t initiate and was busy with his “life”). He told me “of course!”.

When I went to that singing lesson, the teacher told me “oh, didn’t Frank tell you?” (He went to that same teacher because I recommended her to him) “Frank is going on a long trip… a vacation. Exchange I think”. 
I was upset because he told the teacher before me! 
When I finished that singing lesson, and went to see him to his house, he told me.

He revealed to me that he was going to go to Slovenia for an exchange program that our University provided. 6 months. He warned me “It’s your choice. You decide if you still wanna see me. I’m leaving for 6 months, so I leave it up to you.”. He was making me decide if I still wanted to see him, knowing that he would go away for six months.

Of course, I said YES. 
When he came over to my house, I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He looked at me and told me he didn’t believe in labels. I had to insist and he finally said “yes, ok…”. 
He also revealed that he had thought about moving to Brazil. 

I felt defeated that day. Because I had to insist for him to become my boyfriend. 

We started seeing each other more often, and I was feeling happy and content. We would have sex all the time and I felt a strong bond to him.

But everything went downhill before he left.

Ok. My parents noticed my changes and I would always complain to them about Frank. 
They started to… hate him. 

Something terrible happened on February. In February 2nd, 2022, my grandfather died of cancer. I saw it coming, sadly, and that also added up to all the stress and the weight loss.
I saw my grandfather the day before he died: He barely recognized anyone, and he had a terrible cough.  
He was my favorite grandpa. He was like a second dad to me. He would tell me that I’m like sunshine and that I always looked prettier than before 🥹🤍

A week later, Frank’s best friend invites me to his surprise farewell party (for his exchange program). I don’t remember exactly the date that he was leaving, but I think it was around February 15, 2022. 

I went to that party, but I felt weird. He was barely speaking to me. And also I was grieving two losses… my grandfather and the fact that he was leaving so far away. 

I told him: “we could do something for Valentine’s Day…”, and he replied “I have, like, two birthdays…”. I felt like he didn’t want me around. 

Maybe I was overly sensitive, maybe I read things that weren’t there, maybe I overreacted. But I started drinking a lot and got drunk. And I wanted to leave. I texted my dad asking if he could please pick me up.

I told Frank that I was leaving. He asked me “are you ok? Do you feel good? I wasn’t ignoring you. It’s just that I’m with all my friends that I won’t see for a long time and I wanna talk to them. I can see you afterwards. After this”.

I told him that I was sad and I left. 

When my dad picked me up, he saw me crying and he smelled the alcohol. He got super angry at me and he yelled: “You aren’t allowed to see this guy anymore! He’s an idiot!” Which added to my sadness and desperation. I was so desperate. 

It’s hard for me to write this because I feel as if it’s happening right now. I am sorry, it’s just too much for me. And the worst stuff hasn’t even happened yet.

Ok, so my parents decided that I wasn’t allowed to go to his house, he could only come to mine. It’s like they “grounded” me.

Frank, 3 days before leaving to Slovenia, texted me inviting me to dinner at his house. I had to explain that I was grounded because my parents saw me drunk, and they didn’t like that (I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, so my parents prohibited me from drinking). I was like “I am sorry! I can’t! My parents grounded me and they don’t allow me to leave my house! You can come to mine!”

He got so upset. So. Upset. He told me “They treat you like a little kid.” I was so sad and desperate. He told me “If you really love me, you’re gonna escape your house so you can come see me”. I told him “are you crazy? My parents will get even angrier and things will turn terrible and I will be in trouble”. But still, he didn’t understand me and stood on his position “if you really care about me, you would just escape to see me. You’re my girlfriend, and you’re telling me I’m not allowed to have dinner with her before I leave? I think we’re old to be grounded. It’s not like you crashed your car. You got home drunk. Thats all”.
I had to explain to him that I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, and that’s why my parents don’t like it when I drink.
He still didn’t get it.
He told me “They don’t let you drive, the thing that happened with the ‘day after pill’, the fact that they don’t let you stay the night at my house… do they hit you?” 
I don’t drive my car because my father didn’t see that I was completely ready, so he drives me places and picks me up from places. Also I got hit by a car and I’m just lazy, so that’s why I wasn’t driving.
The day after pill… one day I had to take it because the condom broke. My mom got really mad at me for that, and I was scared of her. He was scared of my mom too. Because it happened at my house. 

I told him “no, they don’t hit me. My mom is abusive and controlling sometimes”. He told me “well, that’s shitty too though”. I responded with “I have social anxiety which I suspect is from my mom… I feel so good telling you this because I feel like a weight had lifted off my shoulders” and he told me “I am sorry, this is too much for me. I can’t do this”. He basically left me.

Meanwhile, I was entering a crisis and I thought about suicide. My mother has always been abusive and controlling, and that day… she was terrible. She yelled at me so much… she told me “how can you cry for THAT clown?” My father didn’t defend me and he just supported my mom. 

My mom has a history of being manipulative, dangerous, narcissist, and abusive. She mistreated me many, many times. My sister moved away to Belgium because of this. And the worst part is, Frank told me that. “Your sister moved away because of your mom, right?” And I was like, Yes… 

Thank you. 
When he told me that it all was too much, I told him “that’s okay. I get it”
The day after, he texted me saying “I can come to your house today if you want to”.
He did. He came, but my parents didn’t allow me to be with him in my room. I had to tell him this, so we stayed at another part of the house. We still had sex. 
He asked me “why? Why did this happen? Why couldn’t you escape?” And I told him “I am sorry, my mom is like this and she’s really harsh and I can’t go against her”. 
I asked him if he had told his parents what happened. He told me that he did. When I washed him to tell me what his parents said, he was like “I better not tell you…” It’s like he didn’t want me to know what his parents thought…
He left, and the day after my parents allowed me to go to his house.

We had sex. And it was my way to say goodbye to him. 
Before he left, he asked me for “a break”. I was so heartbroken. I agreed, but as days passed, he starting posting photos being affectionate with other women.

He was in Europe posting photos and videos flirting with other women

After seeing those photos, and videos of him flaunting and hugging other women, I replied to them. I sent him “Are you really posting photos hugging other women while I’m here?” And he replied with “I am happy. Can’t you stand me being happy?” And then he hid his stories from me. 

When I confronted him about this, he told me “Ahh, I forgot to show you my stories again. I’m sorry.”

This happened a few years ago, so I don’t have the same clarity of the memories. But I remember him texting me “I am here for whatever you need”. I decided to stop texting him and forget about him.

I had blocked him, but when he came back (the 6 months had passed) he sent me a text via SMS. He was asking to meet for coffee. 

I declined.

I remember periods of having him blocked, then unblocking him, and then blocking him again… such a rollercoaster…

And I also remember being so angry at my parents. Why ground me when I was suffering so much? They added to my suffering. I feel suffocated and like nobody cared about me. They wanted to see me dead. It was so hard and so difficult for me to overcome this.

I am going to EMDR but this one is tough. 

And there are a thousand more memories I may have forgotten or repressed about all the mistreatment my parents made me endure - especially my mother. She yelled at me so hard to my face at one point telling me “you don’t love us!! You don’t love us!!” 

I still don’t know how I’m still alive after all of this.

After time passed, I saw him again and I did fall again and had sex with him. But he still rejected me: he told me that I wasn’t independent enough from my parents, and that’s what he disliked from me.

I asked him if he wanted to be with me, he said: no, and with anybody else.
I asked him if he wanted to get married and have kids some day: he said no.

After that I blocked him. Everywhere. From social media, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, even SMS. Even Snapchat. 
I think I blocked him in December 2023. 
2024 passed and I was so healthy. 

Started going to the gym and being stronger physically. Even went out with other guys - they treated me like shit.

Now it’s 2025. And I saw him again two days ago.

I acted totally… mean to him. 
At first when he arrived, I said hello to him but then I ignored him. I wouldn’t look at him in the face while talking, and I would totally ignore him if he made jokes or anything.
I even insulted him and mistreated him. I told him he looked like a rat. That the drugs would end up destroying him, that I had sex with someone that had it big (20 cm…), and I even ended up flirting with another friend, right in front of him. I bullied him some more then. 

I’m not proud, I have to say. At the end of the night, he offered to drive me home…

I actually felt horrible the next day.

Yes. I accepted the ride home. He started asking me “are you driving?” I told him I’m taking driving lessons (I lied). He asked me “are you still at uni?” I told him yes, that I’m studying for a final. He asked me if I’m working or something and I told him I’m unemployed, but looking for a job.

Then he asked me “Did I make you feel uncomfortable by being here tonight?” And I told him “no, not at all. Did I make you feel uncomfortable” and he told me “you did make some comments to insult  me”. And I told him “no, no, that’s not correct”.

I still have him blocked everywhere.

I feel a little bit better, yes.
Another thing that happened during the drive home, he told me he was going to his mom’s house. I asked him if his parents were divorced, and he said yes. He told me his dad moved a few months to the USA (we’re all from Argentina) and now he came back and they are separated.
I told him I didn’t know they were separated. I mean, yes, his mom lived in another house but, when I used to go to his house, the mom was sometimes there…
And I told him “well, before you went to Slovenia, I went to your house and your dad was still there”
And he told me “yes, but we saw each other again in December 2024” and I said “yes, your dad wasn’t there…” and hes like “yeah, because he had left to the USA”. And I was like ahhhh. True. Sorry, I just get things mixed up in my brain and I can’t remember things right…

He had the GPS on to get to my house. I told him “ah! You don’t remember where I lived. I guess we’re even”. And he told me “it’s not the same…”

When we got home, I told him “thanks for the ride! Let me know when you return safe…” (but then I remembered I have him blocked even in SMS). And he told me “yeah, I can’t…” and I was like “yeah. Sorry.”

I feel like he hates me and he doesn’t wanna see me again.

The most likely scenario is that he likes that I mistreated him and I have him blocked, and he still wants access to me and have sex with me? He doesn’t hate me?

Tl;dr I’ve been through a lot. I suspect my ex is manipulative and a bad person, but I don’t know for sure. ",0,1748454652.0,relationships,1,0.5,False
1kxnl6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1kxnl6e/science_based_productivity_optimization/,Science Based Productivity Optimization,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been diving into deep work and time-blocking lately — heavily inspired by Cal Newport & Andrew Huberman — and it got me thinking:

**Is there an app that actually combines structured planning with automatic focus protection and feedback loops?**

Here’s what I imagine:

🧠 **Multi-layered planning (as in Deep Work)**  
\- Quarterly goals (bachelor thesis, big projects, etc.)  
\- Weekly scheduling in 30–90min time blocks  
\- Daily focus: exact tasks + refining the day’s structure

📵 **Automatic app blocking during focus blocks**

Using the Screen Time API, the app would block distracting apps/sites the moment a deep work session starts

📊 **Personal productivity analytics**  
This one needs some explanation. After each Deep Work session, you should be able to give yourself a focus score and track specific habits, like how often you were distracted to get the following output:

\- “Phone in the room? → –10% focus”  
\- “Coffee before session? → +15% output”  
\- Track your personal patterns & optimize based on real behavior

The goal is to gain insight on how YOU can optimize your productivity.



👉 **Does anything like this already exist? Would you use something like this?**

If yes, please share it and I'll use it. If not, I’m thinking about building a prototype. Appreciate any thoughts, links or brutal honesty 🙏",1,1748454557.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

This guy called Frank, I met him at Uni, in 2019. It’s 2025 and I’m 27 years old right now. I was born in April 18 of 1998. I think he is one or two years younger than me. 
He showed me interest by asking me out for drinks. I had a great time and I started liking him. But I noticed that he took a few hours before texting be back. I also discovered that he did hard drugs at the time - Weed, Ecstasy, Acid, mushrooms… and other things. 
That turned me off a bit, but not enough for me to stop seeing him. 
There came a point where I questioned him: “why do you take so much time to text me back?” To which he would reply “I have a ‘hands off’ approach when it comes to relationships”. And I didn’t quite understand that… 
Time passed, and I had sex with him. As a way to establish “more connection” with him. 
One time, when I asked him to hang out, he told me he couldn’t because his “turtle had died”. (He had a turtle as a pet). It turned me off, obviously. But I still kept trying.
He would always invite me over to his place (I met his parents). We always had sex. My dad would drive me to his house, and then he’d pick me up. Frank would never come and pick me up from my house. He didn’t have original “plans” for other outings. 
My parents wouldn’t allow me to stay the night at his house. Frank hated this.
I remember we went out for drinks one night. I asked him “What are we?” And I remember him getting so nervous, he had to take off his sweater. He was super nervous and he told me “I just go with the flow”. I didn’t know what to say.
One day, while we were having sex at his house, he was on top and I was at the bottom. He lightly slapped me, súper súper lightly. And then, he closed his fist, and at first he appeared to be about to hit me in the face, but then he didn’t. His face was angry, pressing his lips against each other, looking at me with kind-of crazy eyes. 
It wasn’t violent it was very subtle, and I didn’t react and we kept on having sex.
He never apologized for that. Because he saw nothing wrong with that. 
He never punched me in the face, but I saw that it was “about to happen”.
The day after I felt weird and isolated because he didn’t text me. 
He was living his life and I was “after him”, because I was in love with him.
There are positives: he would be romantic sometimes, he would hug me tightly, and he would be responsive with texts. And sweet. Cute, he would caress my face and make me feel warm. 
But he never asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend. He told me he “didn’t believe in labels”. 

Since 2016 I had social anxiety/social phobia. 
When I met this guy I saw it as a big achievement to go out on dates even though I was terrified of turning red. 
I had all these fears/insecurities inside of me. 
When I saw that this guy just wouldn’t go “official” with me, as in giving me a label of “girlfriend”, I was more and more anxious and I felt more and more insecure. 
I lost a lot of weight during this time because of all the stress.
And also I was showing up as someone “weak”, and he noticed that. 
I was timid, shy, and he seemed to dislike that. Maybe he thought I was “weird”. 
I should add that I am extremely attractive. I am a very good looking woman. I have blue eyes and I’m blonde. 

During December 2021, we were seeing each other more often. I really liked that. I remember going to a voice coach near his house one day, and I texted him “hey!

Of course, I said YES. 
When he came over to my house, I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He looked at me and told me he didn’t believe in labels. I had to insist and he finally said “yes, ok…”. 
He also revealed that he had thought about moving to Brazil. 

I felt defeated that day. Because I had to insist for him to become my boyfriend.

He still didn’t get it.
He told me “They don’t let you drive, the thing that happened with the ‘day after pill’, the fact that they don’t let you stay the night at my house… do they hit you?” 
I don’t drive my car because my father didn’t see that I was completely ready, so he drives me places and picks me up from places. Also I got hit by a car and I’m just lazy, so that’s why I wasn’t driving.

\- Quarterly goals (bachelor thesis, big projects, etc.)  
\- Weekly scheduling in 30–90min time blocks  
\- Daily focus: exact tasks + refining the day’s structure

📵 **Automatic app blocking during focus blocks**

Using the Screen Time API, the app would block distracting apps/sites the moment a deep work session starts

📊 **Personal productivity analytics**  
This one needs some explanation. After each Deep Work session, you should be able to give yourself a focus score and track specific habits, like how often you were distracted to get the following output:

\- “Phone in the room? → –10% focus”  
\- “Coffee before session? → +15% output”  
\- Track your personal patterns & optimize based on real behavior

The goal is to gain insight on how YOU can optimize your productivity.

These timeworn treasures do more than simply occupy space; they carry stories, heritage, and a sense of artistry that modern pieces often lack. Whether it's a weathered wooden armoire passed down through generations or a carefully selected vintage chair from a flea market, antique furniture can transform your home into a sanctuary of style and soul.

**What Defines an Antique Piece?**

Before diving into decorating tips, it's important to understand what makes a piece truly ""antique."" Generally, furniture is considered antique if it is at least 100 years old. This includes styles from periods such as Georgian, Victorian, Edwardian, Art Nouveau, and early 20th-century design movements. These items often exhibit superior craftsmanship, solid wood construction, and intricate details that set them apart from their modern counterparts.

**Why Choose Antique Furniture?**

**1. Character and Charm**

Antique pieces have a lived-in quality that adds depth and warmth to any room. Their imperfections—a worn corner, a faded patina, or a hand-carved detail—tell stories and evoke nostalgia.

**2. Sustainability**

Opting for antiques is a sustainable choice. Reusing and repurposing existing furniture reduces waste and consumption, making it an eco-friendly alternative to buying new.

**3. Investment Value**

Unlike mass-produced furniture, antiques often retain or even increase in value over time, especially if they are well-maintained and rare.

**4. Craftsmanship**

Antique furniture often showcases a level of craftsmanship that is hard to find today. From dovetail joints to hand-carved designs, these elements add unmatched quality and beauty.

**How to Integrate Antiques into Modern Decor**

You don't need to live in a Victorian-era home to enjoy antiques. The beauty of antique furniture lies in its versatility and ability to blend seamlessly with modern design.

**1. Mix and Match**

Pair an antique coffee table with a sleek modern sofa. The contrast between old and new creates visual interest and tells a more layered design story.

**2. Use as Statement Pieces**

Let an antique armoire or dresser take center stage in a room. These pieces can act as focal points and conversation starters.

**3. Functional Art**

Many antiques are as functional as they are beautiful. Consider using a vintage writing desk as a stylish home office setup or a classic sideboard as a bar station.

**4. Balance is Key**

To avoid a room looking like a museum, balance antique pieces with modern elements. Neutral walls, minimalist lighting, and contemporary artwork can help anchor the look.

**Popular Antique Pieces to Consider**

**1. Armoires and Cabinets**

Often handcrafted and richly detailed, antique armoires can serve as storage or a unique wardrobe.

**2.** [**Dining Tables**](https://www.truegether.com/category/antiques) **and Chairs**

A farmhouse table or Queen Anne dining chairs add elegance and charm to any meal.

**3. Desks and Writing Tables**

These pieces are perfect for creating a sophisticated workspace with vintage flair.

**4. Accent Chairs**

From Victorian balloon-back chairs to mid-century modern armchairs, these pieces offer both style and comfort.

**5. Mirrors and Frames**

Ornate gold-leaf frames and bevelled-edge mirrors add glamour and can make a room feel larger and more inviting.

**Tips for Buying Antique Furniture**

**1. Do Your Research**

Familiarize yourself with styles, periods, and makers. This will help you make informed choices and avoid overpaying.

**2. Inspect Carefully**

Check for signs of authenticity, such as dovetail joints, solid wood construction, and maker's marks. Be wary of reproductions.

**3. Consider Restoration Needs**

Some antiques may need minor repairs or restoration. Factor this into your budget and be sure the piece is structurally sound.

**4. Measure Your Space**

Antiques are often larger than modern furniture, so ensure they will fit well in your intended space.

**5. Negotiate Wisely**

Antique dealers often expect a bit of negotiation. Don’t be afraid to haggle, but do so respectfully.

**Caring for Antique Furniture**

To preserve the beauty and value of your antique pieces, proper care is essential.

* **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Prolonged exposure can fade finishes and weaken wood.
* **Control Humidity:** Wood expands and contracts with moisture. Keep humidity levels stable to avoid warping or cracking.
* **Use Gentle Cleaners:** Avoid harsh chemicals. A soft cloth and mild soap are usually sufficient.
* **Regular Dusting:** Dust with a soft, dry cloth to maintain the finish.

**Creating a Cohesive Look**

While antiques can stand out, they shouldn't stick out. Here are a few ways to integrate them seamlessly:

* **Create a Theme:** Choose a common color palette or material to unify the space.
* **Group Similar Items:** Display collections together, such as vintage clocks or ceramic figurines, to create impact.
* **Layer Textures:** Combine wood, leather, glass, and fabric to add richness and depth.
* **Add Modern Accessories:** A modern lamp or contemporary rug can keep the look current.

**Real-Life Success Story**

Consider the case of Sarah and James, a young couple in San Francisco who inherited a set of antique dining chairs from James’ grandmother. Instead of storing them away, they refurbished the chairs and paired them with a glass dining table. The result? A stunning blend of heritage and modernity that became the highlight of their home. Guests frequently comment on the unique setup, and the couple loves the sentimental value those chairs bring.

**Embracing Cultural Heritage Through Antiques**

Antique furniture also allows you to celebrate cultural history. For example, a hand-painted Chinese lacquered cabinet or a Moroccan inlaid side table doesn’t just elevate your home—it brings with it centuries of tradition and artistry. By incorporating such items, you give voice to global craftsmanship and invite storytelling through design.

You can also explore heritage pieces unique to your own culture. A carved Indian jhoola (swing), an old English secretary desk, or a rustic Appalachian bench reflects regional identity and design evolution. These items often hold a deep cultural context, making your décor rich in meaning and beauty.

**How to Tell If a Piece Is Truly Antique**

While some pieces may look old, not all are genuinely antique. Here are a few quick ways to identify authentic antiques:

* **Construction Techniques:** Look for dovetail joints, wooden pegs, or hand-planed surfaces—all signs of older craftsmanship.
* **Wear and Patina:** Natural signs of use, such as slight warping, uneven coloration, or oxidation of hardware, are good indicators.
* **Provenance:** If possible, get the history of the piece. Items with documentation or family stories often carry higher value.
* **Hardware & Fastenings:** Nails, screws, and drawer runners can help date furniture. Hand-forged iron nails, for example, predate machine-made ones.

Understanding these details helps you make informed purchases and builds appreciation for the authenticity and value of antique furniture.

**Decorating by Room: Where Antiques Shine**

**Living Room**

Use an antique trunk as a coffee table or a Victorian settee as a statement couch. Accent the room with a grandfather clock or an aged mirror to tie the space together.

**Bedroom**

Think antique vanities, carved bed frames, and side tables with ornate handles. A weathered armoire can bring elegance and ample storage.

**Dining Room**

Antique buffets and sideboards are great for function and display. Pair them with a table that mixes eras—like a mid-century dining table surrounded by antique chairs.

**Home Office**

A roll-top desk or a vintage lawyer’s bookcase adds character and helps differentiate your work-from-home environment from standard corporate décor.

**Creating Contrast and Harmony**

It’s a common myth that all your furniture must match. In fact, combining antique and modern furniture creates a curated look, as if your home evolved over time rather than being furnished in one shopping trip. Here are a few tricks to achieve harmony:

* **Stick to a Consistent Color Palette:** If you have an antique dark wood cabinet, balance it with other dark wood or neutral pieces.
* **Repeat Materials or Shapes:** If your antique piece features brass hardware, echo that in light fixtures or curtain rods.
* **Use Rugs to Anchor Furniture:** An antique Persian rug beneath a modern coffee table, or vice versa, can create a unified look.

**Incorporating Antiques in Small Spaces**

Worried that your small apartment or condo can’t accommodate antique pieces? Think again. A compact antique writing desk, a small chest used as a side table, or even vintage wall-mounted shelves can bring that old-world charm without overwhelming your space. The key is choosing pieces with scale and proportion in mind.

**Antique Décor as a Personal Expression**

Your home is a reflection of your personality. While modern décor trends come and go, antiques offer a sense of timeless identity. They’re conversation pieces that reflect your values—whether that’s sustainability, heritage, or artistry. Plus, they can be styled in endless ways: rustic, regal, industrial, or eclectic.

**Final Thoughts**

Decorating your home with antique furniture is not just about aesthetics; it's about preserving history, celebrating craftsmanship, and expressing individuality. These pieces carry stories that connect us to the past while enriching our present. Whether you're a seasoned collector or a curious beginner, there's always room for a little old-world charm in today’s modern homes. You can also buy some of the grand and valuable antique furniture from TrueGether, the best [eBay alternative](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html).

So, the next time you walk past that dusty old dresser in a thrift store or consider discarding your grandmother’s rocking chair, think twice. That piece might just be the highlight your home has been waiting for.

1kxnheu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kxnheu/looking_for_other_peoples_perspective_on_this_mess/,Looking for other people’s perspective on this mess,"Okay, I’ll start. This guy called Frank, I met him at Uni, in 2019. It’s 2025 and I’m 27 years old right now. I was born in April 18 of 1998. I think he is one or two years younger than me. 
He showed me interest by asking me out for drinks. I had a great time and I started liking him. But I noticed that he took a few hours before texting be back. I also discovered that he did hard drugs at the time - Weed, Ecstasy, Acid, mushrooms… and other things. 
That turned me off a bit, but not enough for me to stop seeing him. 
There came a point where I questioned him: “why do you take so much time to text me back?” To which he would reply “I have a ‘hands off’ approach when it comes to relationships”. And I didn’t quite understand that… 
Time passed, and I had sex with him. As a way to establish “more connection” with him. 
One time, when I asked him to hang out, he told me he couldn’t because his “turtle had died”. (He had a turtle as a pet). It turned me off, obviously. But I still kept trying.
He would always invite me over to his place (I met his parents). We always had sex. My dad would drive me to his house, and then he’d pick me up. Frank would never come and pick me up from my house. He didn’t have original “plans” for other outings. 
My parents wouldn’t allow me to stay the night at his house. Frank hated this.
I remember we went out for drinks one night. I asked him “What are we?” And I remember him getting so nervous, he had to take off his sweater. He was super nervous and he told me “I just go with the flow”. I didn’t know what to say.
One day, while we were having sex at his house, he was on top and I was at the bottom. He lightly slapped me, súper súper lightly. And then, he closed his fist, and at first he appeared to be about to hit me in the face, but then he didn’t. His face was angry, pressing his lips against each other, looking at me with kind-of crazy eyes. 
It wasn’t violent it was very subtle, and I didn’t react and we kept on having sex.
He never apologized for that. Because he saw nothing wrong with that. 
He never punched me in the face, but I saw that it was “about to happen”.
The day after I felt weird and isolated because he didn’t text me. 
He was living his life and I was “after him”, because I was in love with him.
There are positives: he would be romantic sometimes, he would hug me tightly, and he would be responsive with texts. And sweet. Cute, he would caress my face and make me feel warm. 
But he never asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend. He told me he “didn’t believe in labels”. 

Since 2016 I had social anxiety/social phobia. 
When I met this guy I saw it as a big achievement to go out on dates even though I was terrified of turning red. 
I had all these fears/insecurities inside of me. 
When I saw that this guy just wouldn’t go “official” with me, as in giving me a label of “girlfriend”, I was more and more anxious and I felt more and more insecure. 
I lost a lot of weight during this time because of all the stress.
And also I was showing up as someone “weak”, and he noticed that. 
I was timid, shy, and he seemed to dislike that. Maybe he thought I was “weird”. 
I should add that I am extremely attractive. I am a very good looking woman. I have blue eyes and I’m blonde. 

During December 2021, we were seeing each other more often. I really liked that. I remember going to a voice coach near his house one day, and I texted him “hey! We could see each other since I’m close to your house” (I remember being desperate to see him because he wouldn’t initiate and was busy with his “life”). He told me “of course!”.

When I went to that singing lesson, the teacher told me “oh, didn’t Frank tell you?” (He went to that same teacher because I recommended her to him) “Frank is going on a long trip… a vacation. Exchange I think”. 
I was upset because he told the teacher before me! 
When I finished that singing lesson, and went to see him to his house, he told me.

He revealed to me that he was going to go to Slovenia for an exchange program that our University provided. 6 months. He warned me “It’s your choice. You decide if you still wanna see me. I’m leaving for 6 months, so I leave it up to you.”. He was making me decide if I still wanted to see him, knowing that he would go away for six months.

Of course, I said YES. 
When he came over to my house, I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He looked at me and told me he didn’t believe in labels. I had to insist and he finally said “yes, ok…”. 
He also revealed that he had thought about moving to Brazil. 

I felt defeated that day. Because I had to insist for him to become my boyfriend. 

We started seeing each other more often, and I was feeling happy and content. We would have sex all the time and I felt a strong bond to him.

But everything went downhill before he left.

Ok. My parents noticed my changes and I would always complain to them about Frank. 
They started to… hate him. 

Something terrible happened on February. In February 2nd, 2022, my grandfather died of cancer. I saw it coming, sadly, and that also added up to all the stress and the weight loss.
I saw my grandfather the day before he died: He barely recognized anyone, and he had a terrible cough.  
He was my favorite grandpa. He was like a second dad to me. He would tell me that I’m like sunshine and that I always looked prettier than before 🥹🤍

A week later, Frank’s best friend invites me to his surprise farewell party (for his exchange program). I don’t remember exactly the date that he was leaving, but I think it was around February 15, 2022. 

I went to that party, but I felt weird. He was barely speaking to me. And also I was grieving two losses… my grandfather and the fact that he was leaving so far away. 

I told him: “we could do something for Valentine’s Day…”, and he replied “I have, like, two birthdays…”. I felt like he didn’t want me around. 

Maybe I was overly sensitive, maybe I read things that weren’t there, maybe I overreacted. But I started drinking a lot and got drunk. And I wanted to leave. I texted my dad asking if he could please pick me up.

I told Frank that I was leaving. He asked me “are you ok? Do you feel good? I wasn’t ignoring you. It’s just that I’m with all my friends that I won’t see for a long time and I wanna talk to them. I can see you afterwards. After this”.

I told him that I was sad and I left. 

When my dad picked me up, he saw me crying and he smelled the alcohol. He got super angry at me and he yelled: “You aren’t allowed to see this guy anymore! He’s an idiot!” Which added to my sadness and desperation. I was so desperate. 

It’s hard for me to write this because I feel as if it’s happening right now. I am sorry, it’s just too much for me. And the worst stuff hasn’t even happened yet.

Ok, so my parents decided that I wasn’t allowed to go to his house, he could only come to mine. It’s like they “grounded” me.

Frank, 3 days before leaving to Slovenia, texted me inviting me to dinner at his house. I had to explain that I was grounded because my parents saw me drunk, and they didn’t like that (I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, so my parents prohibited me from drinking). I was like “I am sorry! I can’t! My parents grounded me and they don’t allow me to leave my house! You can come to mine!”

He got so upset. So. Upset. He told me “They treat you like a little kid.” I was so sad and desperate. He told me “If you really love me, you’re gonna escape your house so you can come see me”. I told him “are you crazy? My parents will get even angrier and things will turn terrible and I will be in trouble”. But still, he didn’t understand me and stood on his position “if you really care about me, you would just escape to see me. You’re my girlfriend, and you’re telling me I’m not allowed to have dinner with her before I leave? I think we’re old to be grounded. It’s not like you crashed your car. You got home drunk. Thats all”.
I had to explain to him that I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, and that’s why my parents don’t like it when I drink.
He still didn’t get it.
He told me “They don’t let you drive, the thing that happened with the ‘day after pill’, the fact that they don’t let you stay the night at my house… do they hit you?” 
I don’t drive my car because my father didn’t see that I was completely ready, so he drives me places and picks me up from places. Also I got hit by a car and I’m just lazy, so that’s why I wasn’t driving.
The day after pill… one day I had to take it because the condom broke. My mom got really mad at me for that, and I was scared of her. He was scared of my mom too. Because it happened at my house. 

I told him “no, they don’t hit me. My mom is abusive and controlling sometimes”. He told me “well, that’s shitty too though”. I responded with “I have social anxiety which I suspect is from my mom… I feel so good telling you this because I feel like a weight had lifted off my shoulders” and he told me “I am sorry, this is too much for me. I can’t do this”. He basically left me.

Meanwhile, I was entering a crisis and I thought about suicide. My mother has always been abusive and controlling, and that day… she was terrible. She yelled at me so much… she told me “how can you cry for THAT clown?” My father didn’t defend me and he just supported my mom. 

My mom has a history of being manipulative, dangerous, narcissist, and abusive. She mistreated me many, many times. My sister moved away to Belgium because of this. And the worst part is, Frank told me that. “Your sister moved away because of your mom, right?” And I was like, Yes… 

Thank you. 
When he told me that it all was too much, I told him “that’s okay. I get it”
The day after, he texted me saying “I can come to your house today if you want to”.
He did. He came, but my parents didn’t allow me to be with him in my room. I had to tell him this, so we stayed at another part of the house. We still had sex. 
He asked me “why? Why did this happen? Why couldn’t you escape?” And I told him “I am sorry, my mom is like this and she’s really harsh and I can’t go against her”. 
I asked him if he had told his parents what happened. He told me that he did. When I washed him to tell me what his parents said, he was like “I better not tell you…” It’s like he didn’t want me to know what his parents thought…
He left, and the day after my parents allowed me to go to his house.

We had sex. And it was my way to say goodbye to him. 
Before he left, he asked me for “a break”. I was so heartbroken. I agreed, but as days passed, he starting posting photos being affectionate with other women.

He was in Europe posting photos and videos flirting with other women

After seeing those photos, and videos of him flaunting and hugging other women, I replied to them. I sent him “Are you really posting photos hugging other women while I’m here?” And he replied with “I am happy. Can’t you stand me being happy?” And then he hid his stories from me. 

When I confronted him about this, he told me “Ahh, I forgot to show you my stories again. I’m sorry.”

This happened a few years ago, so I don’t have the same clarity of the memories. But I remember him texting me “I am here for whatever you need”. I decided to stop texting him and forget about him.

I had blocked him, but when he came back (the 6 months had passed) he sent me a text via SMS. He was asking to meet for coffee. 

I declined.

I remember periods of having him blocked, then unblocking him, and then blocking him again… such a rollercoaster…

And I also remember being so angry at my parents. Why ground me when I was suffering so much? They added to my suffering. I feel suffocated and like nobody cared about me. They wanted to see me dead. It was so hard and so difficult for me to overcome this.

I am going to EMDR but this one is tough. 

And there are a thousand more memories I may have forgotten or repressed about all the mistreatment my parents made me endure - especially my mother. She yelled at me so hard to my face at one point telling me “you don’t love us!! You don’t love us!!” 

I still don’t know how I’m still alive after all of this.

After time passed, I saw him again and I did fall again and had sex with him. But he still rejected me: he told me that I wasn’t independent enough from my parents, and that’s what he disliked from me.

I asked him if he wanted to be with me, he said: no, and with anybody else.
I asked him if he wanted to get married and have kids some day: he said no.

After that I blocked him. Everywhere. From social media, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, even SMS. Even Snapchat. 
I think I blocked him in December 2023. 
2024 passed and I was so healthy. 

Started going to the gym and being stronger physically. Even went out with other guys - they treated me like shit.

Now it’s 2025. And I saw him again two days ago.

I acted totally… mean to him. 
At first when he arrived, I said hello to him but then I ignored him. I wouldn’t look at him in the face while talking, and I would totally ignore him if he made jokes or anything.
I even insulted him and mistreated him. I told him he looked like a rat. That the drugs would end up destroying him, that I had sex with someone that had it big (20 cm…), and I even ended up flirting with another friend, right in front of him. I bullied him some more then. 

I’m not proud, I have to say. At the end of the night, he offered to drive me home…

I actually felt horrible the next day.

Yes. I accepted the ride home. He started asking me “are you driving?” I told him I’m taking driving lessons (I lied). He asked me “are you still at uni?” I told him yes, that I’m studying for a final. He asked me if I’m working or something and I told him I’m unemployed, but looking for a job.

Then he asked me “Did I make you feel uncomfortable by being here tonight?” And I told him “no, not at all. Did I make you feel uncomfortable” and he told me “you did make some comments to insult  me”. And I told him “no, no, that’s not correct”.

I still have him blocked everywhere.

I feel a little bit better, yes.
Another thing that happened during the drive home, he told me he was going to his mom’s house. I asked him if his parents were divorced, and he said yes. He told me his dad moved a few months to the USA (we’re all from Argentina) and now he came back and they are separated.
I told him I didn’t know they were separated. I mean, yes, his mom lived in another house but, when I used to go to his house, the mom was sometimes there…
And I told him “well, before you went to Slovenia, I went to your house and your dad was still there”
And he told me “yes, but we saw each other again in December 2024” and I said “yes, your dad wasn’t there…” and hes like “yeah, because he had left to the USA”. And I was like ahhhh. True. Sorry, I just get things mixed up in my brain and I can’t remember things right…

He had the GPS on to get to my house. I told him “ah! You don’t remember where I lived. I guess we’re even”. And he told me “it’s not the same…”

When we got home, I told him “thanks for the ride! Let me know when you return safe…” (but then I remembered I have him blocked even in SMS). And he told me “yeah, I can’t…” and I was like “yeah. Sorry.”

I feel like he hates me and he doesn’t wanna see me again.

The most likely scenario is that he likes that I mistreated him and I have him blocked, and he still wants access to me and have sex with me? He doesn’t hate me?",1,1748454310.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Since 2016 I had social anxiety/social phobia. 
When I met this guy I saw it as a big achievement to go out on dates even though I was terrified of turning red. 
I had all these fears/insecurities inside of me. 
When I saw that this guy just wouldn’t go “official” with me, as in giving me a label of “girlfriend”, I was more and more anxious and I felt more and more insecure. 
I lost a lot of weight during this time because of all the stress.
And also I was showing up as someone “weak”, and he noticed that. 
I was timid, shy, and he seemed to dislike that. Maybe he thought I was “weird”. 
I should add that I am extremely attractive. I am a very good looking woman. I have blue eyes and I’m blonde. 

During December 2021, we were seeing each other more often. I really liked that. I remember going to a voice coach near his house one day, and I texted him “hey! We could see each other since I’m close to your house” (I remember being desperate to see him because he wouldn’t initiate and was busy with his “life”). He told me “of course!”.

When I went to that singing lesson, the teacher told me “oh, didn’t Frank tell you?” (He went to that same teacher because I recommended her to him) “Frank is going on a long trip… a vacation. Exchange I think”. 
I was upset because he told the teacher before me! 
When I finished that singing lesson, and went to see him to his house, he told me.

He revealed to me that he was going to go to Slovenia for an exchange program that our University provided. 6 months. He warned me “It’s your choice. You decide if you still wanna see me. I’m leaving for 6 months, so I leave it up to you.”. He was making me decide if I still wanted to see him, knowing that he would go away for six months.

Of course, I said YES. 
When he came over to my house, I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He looked at me and told me he didn’t believe in labels. I had to insist and he finally said “yes, ok…”. 
He also revealed that he had thought about moving to Brazil. 

I felt defeated that day. Because I had to insist for him to become my boyfriend. 

We started seeing each other more often, and I was feeling happy and content. We would have sex all the time and I felt a strong bond to him.

But everything went downhill before he left.

Ok. My parents noticed my changes and I would always complain to them about Frank. 
They started to… hate him. 

Something terrible happened on February. In February 2nd, 2022, my grandfather died of cancer. I saw it coming, sadly, and that also added up to all the stress and the weight loss.
I saw my grandfather the day before he died: He barely recognized anyone, and he had a terrible cough.  
He was my favorite grandpa. He was like a second dad to me. He would tell me that I’m like sunshine and that I always looked prettier than before 🥹🤍

A week later, Frank’s best friend invites me to his surprise farewell party (for his exchange program). I don’t remember exactly the date that he was leaving, but I think it was around February 15, 2022. 

I went to that party, but I felt weird. He was barely speaking to me. And also I was grieving two losses… my grandfather and the fact that he was leaving so far away. 

I told him: “we could do something for Valentine’s Day…”, and he replied “I have, like, two birthdays…”. I felt like he didn’t want me around. 

Maybe I was overly sensitive, maybe I read things that weren’t there, maybe I overreacted. But I started drinking a lot and got drunk. And I wanted to leave. I texted my dad asking if he could please pick me up.

I told Frank that I was leaving. He asked me “are you ok? Do you feel good? I wasn’t ignoring you. It’s just that I’m with all my friends that I won’t see for a long time and I wanna talk to them. I can see you afterwards. After this”.

I told him that I was sad and I left. 

When my dad picked me up, he saw me crying and he smelled the alcohol. He got super angry at me and he yelled: “You aren’t allowed to see this guy anymore! He’s an idiot!” Which added to my sadness and desperation. I was so desperate. 

It’s hard for me to write this because I feel as if it’s happening right now. I am sorry, it’s just too much for me. And the worst stuff hasn’t even happened yet.

Ok, so my parents decided that I wasn’t allowed to go to his house, he could only come to mine. It’s like they “grounded” me.

Frank, 3 days before leaving to Slovenia, texted me inviting me to dinner at his house. I had to explain that I was grounded because my parents saw me drunk, and they didn’t like that (I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, so my parents prohibited me from drinking). I was like “I am sorry! I can’t! My parents grounded me and they don’t allow me to leave my house! You can come to mine!”

He got so upset. So. Upset. He told me “They treat you like a little kid.” I was so sad and desperate. He told me “If you really love me, you’re gonna escape your house so you can come see me”. I told him “are you crazy? My parents will get even angrier and things will turn terrible and I will be in trouble”. But still, he didn’t understand me and stood on his position “if you really care about me, you would just escape to see me. You’re my girlfriend, and you’re telling me I’m not allowed to have dinner with her before I leave? I think we’re old to be grounded. It’s not like you crashed your car. You got home drunk. Thats all”.
I had to explain to him that I once came back home so drunk that I was almost hospitalized, and that’s why my parents don’t like it when I drink.
He still didn’t get it.
He told me “They don’t let you drive, the thing that happened with the ‘day after pill’, the fact that they don’t let you stay the night at my house… do they hit you?” 
I don’t drive my car because my father didn’t see that I was completely ready, so he drives me places and picks me up from places. Also I got hit by a car and I’m just lazy, so that’s why I wasn’t driving.
The day after pill… one day I had to take it because the condom broke. My mom got really mad at me for that, and I was scared of her. He was scared of my mom too. Because it happened at my house. 

I told him “no, they don’t hit me. My mom is abusive and controlling sometimes”. He told me “well, that’s shitty too though”. I responded with “I have social anxiety which I suspect is from my mom… I feel so good telling you this because I feel like a weight had lifted off my shoulders” and he told me “I am sorry, this is too much for me. I can’t do this”. He basically left me.

Meanwhile, I was entering a crisis and I thought about suicide. My mother has always been abusive and controlling, and that day… she was terrible. She yelled at me so much… she told me “how can you cry for THAT clown?” My father didn’t defend me and he just supported my mom. 

My mom has a history of being manipulative, dangerous, narcissist, and abusive. She mistreated me many, many times. My sister moved away to Belgium because of this. And the worst part is, Frank told me that. “Your sister moved away because of your mom, right?” And I was like, Yes… 

Thank you. 
When he told me that it all was too much, I told him “that’s okay. I get it”
The day after, he texted me saying “I can come to your house today if you want to”.
He did. He came, but my parents didn’t allow me to be with him in my room. I had to tell him this, so we stayed at another part of the house. We still had sex. 
He asked me “why? Why did this happen? Why couldn’t you escape?” And I told him “I am sorry, my mom is like this and she’s really harsh and I can’t go against her”. 
I asked him if he had told his parents what happened. He told me that he did. When I washed him to tell me what his parents said, he was like “I better not tell you…” It’s like he didn’t want me to know what his parents thought…
He left, and the day after my parents allowed me to go to his house.

We had sex. And it was my way to say goodbye to him. 
Before he left, he asked me for “a break”. I was so heartbroken. I agreed, but as days passed, he starting posting photos being affectionate with other women.

He was in Europe posting photos and videos flirting with other women

After seeing those photos, and videos of him flaunting and hugging other women, I replied to them. I sent him “Are you really posting photos hugging other women while I’m here?” And he replied with “I am happy. Can’t you stand me being happy?” And then he hid his stories from me. 

When I confronted him about this, he told me “Ahh, I forgot to show you my stories again. I’m sorry.”

This happened a few years ago, so I don’t have the same clarity of the memories. But I remember him texting me “I am here for whatever you need”. I decided to stop texting him and forget about him.

I had blocked him, but when he came back (the 6 months had passed) he sent me a text via SMS. He was asking to meet for coffee. 

I declined.

I remember periods of having him blocked, then unblocking him, and then blocking him again… such a rollercoaster…

And I also remember being so angry at my parents. Why ground me when I was suffering so much? They added to my suffering. I feel suffocated and like nobody cared about me. They wanted to see me dead. It was so hard and so difficult for me to overcome this.

I am going to EMDR but this one is tough. 

And there are a thousand more memories I may have forgotten or repressed about all the mistreatment my parents made me endure - especially my mother. She yelled at me so hard to my face at one point telling me “you don’t love us!! You don’t love us!!” 

I still don’t know how I’m still alive after all of this.

After time passed, I saw him again and I did fall again and had sex with him. But he still rejected me: he told me that I wasn’t independent enough from my parents, and that’s what he disliked from me.

I asked him if he wanted to be with me, he said: no, and with anybody else.
I asked him if he wanted to get married and have kids some day: he said no.

After that I blocked him. Everywhere. From social media, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, even SMS. Even Snapchat. 
I think I blocked him in December 2023. 
2024 passed and I was so healthy. 

Started going to the gym and being stronger physically. Even went out with other guys - they treated me like shit.

Now it’s 2025. And I saw him again two days ago.

I acted totally… mean to him. 
At first when he arrived, I said hello to him but then I ignored him. I wouldn’t look at him in the face while talking, and I would totally ignore him if he made jokes or anything.
I even insulted him and mistreated him. I told him he looked like a rat. That the drugs would end up destroying him, that I had sex with someone that had it big (20 cm…), and I even ended up flirting with another friend, right in front of him. I bullied him some more then. 

I’m not proud, I have to say. At the end of the night, he offered to drive me home…

I actually felt horrible the next day.

Yes. I accepted the ride home. He started asking me “are you driving?” I told him I’m taking driving lessons (I lied). He asked me “are you still at uni?” I told him yes, that I’m studying for a final. He asked me if I’m working or something and I told him I’m unemployed, but looking for a job.

Then he asked me “Did I make you feel uncomfortable by being here tonight?” And I told him “no, not at all. Did I make you feel uncomfortable” and he told me “you did make some comments to insult  me”. And I told him “no, no, that’s not correct”.

I still have him blocked everywhere.

I feel a little bit better, yes.
Another thing that happened during the drive home, he told me he was going to his mom’s house. I asked him if his parents were divorced, and he said yes. He told me his dad moved a few months to the USA (we’re all from Argentina) and now he came back and they are separated.
I told him I didn’t know they were separated. I mean, yes, his mom lived in another house but, when I used to go to his house, the mom was sometimes there…
And I told him “well, before you went to Slovenia, I went to your house and your dad was still there”
And he told me “yes, but we saw each other again in December 2024” and I said “yes, your dad wasn’t there…” and hes like “yeah, because he had left to the USA”. And I was like ahhhh. True. Sorry, I just get things mixed up in my brain and I can’t remember things right…

He had the GPS on to get to my house. I told him “ah! You don’t remember where I lived. I guess we’re even”. And he told me “it’s not the same…”

When we got home, I told him “thanks for the ride! Let me know when you return safe…” (but then I remembered I have him blocked even in SMS). And he told me “yeah, I can’t…” and I was like “yeah. Sorry.”

I feel like he hates me and he doesn’t wanna see me again.

The most likely scenario is that he likes that I mistreated him and I have him blocked, and he still wants access to me and have sex with me? He doesn’t hate me?",1,1748454260.0,EMDR,0,1.0,False

I’ve been dating my partner for about a year. We’re both food lovers and enjoy going out to eat. I also love cooking, and one of the main ways I express affection is through acts of service and gift-giving—especially when I make something myself. So it’s natural for me to show love by preparing meals or taking her to interesting restaurants and coffee shops.

We both take care of our bodies in different ways. She goes to the gym several times a week, and I do mountain biking. Fitness and health are important to both of us, but food is still a big way we connect and enjoy time together.

Recently, though, things have shifted a bit. A few weeks ago, she got upset because some of her clothes weren’t fitting the way she wanted. She mentioned feeling like she was gaining weight and immediately started worrying about her diet. A couple of days later, she had a craving for a specific kind of food, so we went out to get it. Afterward, she said we shouldn’t be eating at places like that anymore because it could make her gain more weight. I reminded her she had suggested it, and she told me that instead of just agreeing, I should help her make healthier choices.

Later that same day, she kept pinching her waist and saying she felt fat. I tried to be supportive, but I wasn’t sure what the right response was.

More recently, we visited a coffee shop she loved. The drink she ordered was very sweet, but she didn’t complain about it at all and even talked about how much she enjoyed it. The next day, she wanted to go back, but the shop is kind of far, and with how expensive gas is right now, it’s not a trip we can make often.

This morning, I decided to surprise her by making French toast and recreating the drink she liked. It took me about an hour while I was juggling work, and I even decorated everything to make it special. I knew it wouldn’t be exactly the same, but I was proud of the effort and thought she’d be happy.

Instead, she started asking how much sugar and milk were in it, and whether it was too indulgent. She didn’t really acknowledge the gesture or the time I spent trying to make something thoughtful, especially when we’re trying to save money by staying in more.

I didn’t say anything at the time, but it kind of stung. I understand she’s worried about her weight, and I want to respect that. But it’s also been making me feel like I can’t express love in the ways that come naturally to me. Now I’m questioning myself and feeling insecure about even trying.

**How can I bring this up with her without invalidating her feelings or coming off as unsupportive? I want to respect her concerns and still feel comfortable showing affection in ways that feel meaningful to me.**

**TL;DR:**  
My partner is becoming more focused on her weight and health, which I respect, but it's making it hard for me to express love through cooking and thoughtful food-related surprises—my main love language. I feel hurt and unsure how to talk to her about this without dismissing her concerns.",1,1748454258.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Recipe: 95 clicks on K6, 10g in

30g bloom, wait 30 seconds

Pour to 60, 90, 120, 160 waiting for it to stop draining every time to start the new pour. Total drawdown time 2:10. Pour method was close to the bed, with as little disturbance to the bed as possible.

  
Smell: Weirdly, this smelled both fruity but also like mini m&ms. Not sure how else to describe it.

Taste: Juicy, somewhat tea-like since it was on the Deep 27, but still nice juiciness. If I had to name a fruit I would say mango. Something tropical, at least. As it cooled, it got sweeter and had some pleasant notes of sugarcane.

Overall rating, 10/10. One of the tastiest coffees I've had in a long time.

Location: Monterey Park, CA 

My neighbor is insane. And I don’t say that lightly as I take my meds for my own mental health. But she has a couple of screws loose. 

This all started back in February (only lived at this apartment since June ‘24) when my husband and I filled some holes with dirt and covered them with grass seed in the common area of our quadplex apartment. We did this so our toddler, who was learning to walk, wouldn’t trip in them. I disgress, I shouldn’t have to make excuses for minor landscaping. After the holes were filled, her and her two teenage boys called them “weird” several times in the common area where I could hear them. So, I finally said something from my porch to her on her steps (where she could clearly hear). “Hey, it’s just a little landscaping, I thought everyone would enjoy the holes being gone.” She ignores me and continues into her apartment. The next time I see her from my porch, she yells “WEIRD!” right before she goes inside and slams her door. 

A few weeks go by, and we get a complaint from our landlord from said neighbor. Everyone in the quadplex was putting their cans in front of her garage slots. That would normally be a problem, right? But here’s the thing - she doesn’t use the garage slots. She has one car, and always parks it on the street by our front door. The landlord told us to do this on move in. So week one, she complains and we take them in. Week two, she complains again - the garbage truck put them in front of her slots. Week three, she complains specifically about our cans - but here’s the thing, we didn’t put them out! At this point, our landlord lets us know she’s a “mean lady”, “abrasive”, and ran off a tenant living below her. She then begins to clean all the junk out of her garage slots (important later). So that’s March. 

April comes around, and our “abrasive” neighbor takes to playing music at 65-70 decibels (10-15 over the city daytime decibel limit) and singing loudly along with it. It wakes up my toddler from her nap, so I let the landlord know. He says there’s nothing he can do about it. It happens again, and I let it slide because it doesn’t wake up my kid. Third time it happens my kid is down for a nap again and my husband is trying to work from home on the porch. During her first song (an appropriate title called “Guess Who’s Back” by Eminem), she comes out to her porch to water her plants. When she’s finished and turns back to walk to her front door, I call up and say, “Hey, my kiddo is asleep, do you mind turning your music down?” She ignores me and slams her front door. At this, as I don’t want to deal with her attitude and I don’t know how she’ll react to me… I call the cops. They can deal with her instead. So they show up, and she makes an ass out of herself. Calling the sheriff’s department to complain about them in front of them, following them back to their patrol car, asking them if they need to see her Social Security card, and blatantly lying about me in front of me (said I smoke cannabis around my child, I almost exploded). She also admitted to the cops that she heard me, ignored me because it wasn’t “decent” (we live super close… it’s Cali. Maybe 40-50 ft?) But the biggest snafu of hers in this situation was that she started openly filming us on our fenced patio (she lives upstairs), which is illegal in California without my consent. I let the landlord know. He informs us she is annoyed by my husband’s persistent cough that he’s had since a child (also yes sometimes we cough when we smoke weed on the porch) and a tapping sound made when we knocked out the bowl. 

A few days later she started filming us again, so I took a picture of her recording us and sent it to my landlord, asking for help. He tells us to “get a pillow or go somewhere like the park” to cough. We had also mentioned that she gets upset at the bubbles from our small bubbles machine we used in our enclosed porch for the enjoyment of our toddler. Our landlord also said we “should” call the cops if she filmed us again, and that it was “creepy”. 

She then goes to the City and has an inspector come out to cite code violations. She does this at this particular time to seek revenge on us. I think because she was previously cleaning out her garage slots that she had already planned to do this, but to me the timing is suspect, especially when our landlord told use she was going to the City after talking with him about the coughs. 

Our landlord then begins to try and police what we do on our rental property, saying we cannot smoke out there. It’s never been a problem before, because her downstairs neighbor smokes weed, and he’s lived there years before us. Neither has the noise of a cough, because Unit D informed us that the older gentlemen who lived here before us would wake up and cough, smoke cigarettes, and play loud music on the porch frequently. She has it out for us for some reason. 

Also, the day he forbade us from smoking, he sent us screenshots from the nuisance neighbor that she was in the hospital - she has an auto- immune disorder, and the stress of our harassment i.e. us existing on our porch caused her to go to the emergency room. 
The morning after our landlord forbade us and only us from smoking cannabis on our porch and the hospital texts, we got two texts from him at 2AM. These texts were screenshots of the neighbor’s text to him about a “glass-on-glass tapping noise” that woke her up. We were asleep - it wasn’t us. She’s clearly having hallucinations. 

This morning, I was sitting quietly on my porch drinking coffee, and a repairman came by. He needed into the laundry room, which was locked with a code. I didn’t have the code, but right as I’m saying that out comes my nuisance of a neighbor. She starts telling the poor repairman about what’s been going on with the code violations, so I walk out into the common area and start filming her. And at the end of the video, she has the hall to suggest AGAIN that I smoke cannabis around my toddler. 

Oh! I also talked with another neighbor yesterday, and he told us that about four years ago her kids almost burnt the complex down. And confirmed that she ran off his roommate.

I think that’s all the insanely petty shit we’ve been dealing with. We have almost all of this documented thru texts with our landlord, two police reports, and a video of her slandering me from the common area this morning. What can I do to make all this stop? We don’t want to move because the spot and location is great for us and especially the kiddo. ",1,1748454060.0,legaladvice,0,0.67,False
1kxncay,https://www.reddit.com/r/KneeInjuries/comments/1kxncay/oats_procedure_recovery/,OATS Procedure Recovery,"I (28F) recently went through an OATS procedure to fix an 8mm defect in the cartilage and bone on the medial femoral condyle in my right knee. Leading up to the surgery, I felt like there wasn’t a lot of information on the procedure online and the information that was available made recovery seem brutal. I thought I’d keep notes on my recovery and share my experience through the first 3 or so months post-op. Overall not fun (as all knee surgeries go), but very much bearable and doable! I’ve included all of my brain dump notes and benchmarks below. I hope this helps anyone trying to find info online!

Pre-Surgery items:
- had to shower with hibiclens 4 times over the course of three days
- Ordered an ice machine off Amazon
- Ordered a shower stool off Amazon. I got one that swiveled which ended up being a big help getting in and out of the shower. Also, I was able to use the stool to sit at the bathroom sink to wash my face/brush my teeth/etc.
- Had a CPM machine ordered by my doctor and delivered to my apartment the day before the surgery

General tips:
- Scope out how you’ll be able to sit on the toilet and in the shower with your leg straight out so that you aren’t trying to figure it out for the first time while you’re in pain. Make sure you have something to prop your surgical leg up on or else it will be extremely uncomfortable to have it hovering. We have a squatty potty which turned out to be the perfect height for my foot to rest on while I used the toilet. For the shower, I just propped my foot up on the edge of the tub.
- Have a bag of ice on hand to help with ice production - you’ll go through a lot of it!
- This sounds silly, but my Owala water bottle ended up coming in clutch in massive ways. Having a water bottle you can drink from without having to sit up and you can leave laying next to you without leaking is huge when you wake up in the middle of the night in pain and need to take meds. Plus, the latch made it easy to carry with the crutches. 
- I was parked on the couch for most of the first few days and kept a “snack and meds” box that slid under the couch so I could easily access my meds and snacks to coat my stomach any time I needed to take them.
- Have an idea of what shorts and pants you’ll be able to wear. The brace is very bulky and if you’re wearing pants, you’ll want to be able to pull your pants leg up to your upper thigh for when you need to ice, adjust the brace, etc.
- I have a desk job and took off a full week before I started working remotely again. I went into the office for the first time three weeks post op for just one day and slowly ramped back up to my typical three days in office by week 5.


Day 1: Surgery Day

Check in time was 9:45am. Surgery was scheduled for 11:15 but ended up being closer to 11:45. I was in recovery by 1pm and in the car headed home by 2:30pm.

I arrived at the outpatient surgery center around 9:45am. They had me change into the hospital gown and then took me to a pre-op area where they started an IV and took my vitals. After the IV they let my wife come back and sit with me for a while. The surgeon stopped by and chatted. They asked if I was prone motion sickness and I am, so they put a patch behind my ear to help with nausea after anesthesia. As far as I can tell, the patch worked. I didn’t have any issues with nausea following the surgery. The anesthesiologist came over and introduced herself and gave me a run down of the anesthesia I would be getting as well as what happens during the nerve block. I had gotten a little woozy when they did my IV earlier (I have terrible veins and was dehydrated) so they pushed something through my IV to chill me out a little (I’m not sure what it was) for them to do the nerve block procedure. The anesthesiologist injected the nerve block into my hip. The procedure for the nerve block wasn’t painful, just weird. They use ultrasound to locate the nerve they’re going to block (femoral nerve in my case) then they use a needle to inject the nerve block around the nerve. I only felt a slight pinch at first like any other shot followed by some growing pressure as they injected the medicine. After a few minutes my leg was completely numb and they wheeled me back to the OR. After they transferred me onto the operating table, I was awake for maybe a minute until they put a mask on with anesthesia and I was out immediately. I woke up in the recovery area. I slowly came to and they brought me water, graham crackers, and coffee. After a little while my wife rejoined me. They offered pain meds, but I only felt like I needed Tylenol for a little pain at the back of my knee. After more waiting my wife helped me get dressed. They made me putz around on the crutches a bit. The orders were to restrict to 0% weight bearing on my surgical leg while it was still numb from the nerve block and then I could increase to 50% weight bearing once it wore off. Once I proved I could use the crutches they wheeled me down to the car in a wheelchair.  I sat in the back seat with my surgery leg stretched across the seat. I had some mild discomfort but no major complaints for the 45min drive home. I started with only advil and Tylenol and took my first oxycodone around 8pm (8hrs post-op). Once home I started icing. Because of how thick the ace bandages are, it’s difficult to ice the knee, but I would rotate ice packs around the skin on my leg that was exposed (upper thigh, ankle, back of the knee).  I was able to sleep 2-3hrs uninterrupted between oxycodone doses every 4hrs. Around 3am i woke up to my leg feeling really warm, so I iced then. I set an alarm to wake me up to take meds to stay ahead of the pain. I would rate my worst persistent pain at a 4.

Day 2:
I woke up in the morning with a noticeable increase in discomfort. Since the nerve block had worn off I was able to start 50% weight bearing on my surgical leg while using the crutches. Sitting wasnt necessarily painful, but because of the swelling/ace bandages/brace I felt a huge amount of pressure especially along the large incision over my knee cap. Moving the leg around caused some pain, but was bearable. After my oxycodone dose in the morning I was able to get up to do most of my typical morning routine (brush teeth/wash face/put contacts in/etc). Pain got worse throughout the day. Mid-afternoon I tried the CPM machine for the first time. I had it set to 0°-30° and only for 30min. While in the machine I didn’t experience much pain, but had my worst pain by far in the few hours afterwards. When it became clear that the pain wasn’t going anywhere, I did my best to get comfortable and sleep it off. I slept relatively well again that night. Would rate my worst persistent pain at a 7. 

Day 3:
I woke up in even more pain than day 2 plus feeling woozy from the pain meds. I took a zofran that I happened to have for the nausea but remained dizzy through the afternoon. Around midday I could finally take the dressing off my knee and I was excited to shower. I unfortunately was still too woozy from the oxycodone to shower, but just taking the super tight wrapping off relieved most of the pain I was feeling. I had minimal pain the rest of the day managing through Advil and Tylenol. I did two sessions on the CPM machine to 30° with no pain. I had the ice machine on at the same time and the only weird part was feeling the tightness from the sutures and steristrips. I stuck to just Advil and Tylenol through the night. The morning had been my worst part of recovery so far between the wooziness and pain with the worst persistent pain at probably an 8. The afternoon through the night was much better at maybe a 4.

Day 4:
Despite only taking one dose each of Tylenol and Advil during the night, I woke up pretty comfortable. The ace bandage I put back on my knee after taking the dressing off felt a little tight and I had some discomfort from swelling that set in overnight, but overall was greatly improved compared to how I woke up day 3. I was able to shower comfortably. I took an excursion out to get lunch which was my first time out of the house. Getting in and out of the car was still pretty uncomfortable on the incision. Before bed I took Advil and ended up sleeping with my leg flat because I couldn’t get comfortable with it propped up. I woke up around 3am with some mild discomfort from the swelling so I took some Advil and elevated my leg and went back to sleep. Highest persistent pain (excluding the car ride to and from my lunch excursion) was maybe a 3. At this point it’s mostly just the incision that feels tight and kind of burns, no real joint pain.

Day 5-6: 
Mostly still just a burning/stinging from the incision. None of the steri strips have fallen off despite two showers since surgery. I’m up to 60° on the CPM. I’m able to do quad sets (have been since day 3), but still can’t lift my leg. 

One Week Post Op:
I slept for 8 uninterrupted hours for the first time since surgery going into day 7. I woke up with some discomfort around the incision, but it was very bearable. Getting around is getting easier. I have been withstanding 50% weight bearing with crutches since day 3 with no joint pain while walking. The biggest discomfort continues to be the stitches and the incision. I have been persistent with the CPM machine and have reached 80° without any pain aside from the stretching/tightness around the incision. My muscles are slowly starting to fire again and every day I notice I can move my leg a little more without having to pick it up with my hands and move it. I can sit in the shower or at the table with my leg straight down for a decent amount of time before it gets uncomfortable. 

Day 10:
Post op appointment. Started by taking xrays (just 3 pictures). It turns out that I had dissolvable sutures. They removed the steristrips (only one had fallen off on its own) and got rid of what was left of the sutures. The surgeon checked the fitting of the brace. He adjusted the range of motion on the brace to go to 90°, but ordered that when I am up and walking around I keep it locked at extension until I can do a leg lift. He said that I should maintain 50% weight bearing until the 3 week mark and then I can lose the crutches. I was also cleared to stop wearing the brace while sleeping.

Day 12:
First PT appointment. Measured my balance and strength on my non-surgical leg. Did some light massaging for scar tissue around the incision and moved my knee cap a bit. My quad still isn’t firing, so we tried the TENS machine and it didn’t do much. Did a few light exercises and sent me on my way.

Day 14 (Two Weeks Post Op):
I woke up on day 14 and miraculously could finally do a full straight leg raise. It was still very painful to do the leg raise, but this meant I could finally unlock my brace while I was up and moving around. The incision is healing nicely, but is still a source of discomfort. It doesn’t actively hurt or sting like it did, but it mostly just feels tight/restrictive. The scar is also still sensitive to heavy blankets or pants rubbing against it. I have decent range of motion back and am getting around pretty easily. I am sleeping through the night without any major discomfort aside from being stuck on my back when I am typically a stomach sleeper. 

Day 21 (Three Weeks Post Op):
Range of motion continues to improve and I can bend to close to 110°. My quad still has not fired back up, but it flexed in PT when we used the TENS machine. I still have a lot of pain when trying to do a leg lift laying on my back, but can do leg lifts in the other 3 directions no problem (on each side and on my stomach). My incision is healing really nicely and I no longer have any issues with blankets or pants rubbing against it. I went into the office for the first time this week and mostly did ok. By the end of the day I was squatting in conference rooms to have a second chair to prop my leg up on, but otherwise didn’t have any issues. Because I’m still having trouble controlling my lower leg, I haven’t been able to start driving yet. I’m able to lay on either side or my stomach for a few minutes at a time, but am still stuck sleeping on my back.

Day 28 (Four Weeks Post-Op):
Biggest milestone this week has been walking without crutches. I’m very slow and very much have a limp, but it’s getting better by the day. I finally had enough range of motion to pedal a stationary bike a full rotation. My scar is significantly less sensitive. I’m still very aware of it, but it’s not painful to touch. I tried driving for the first time and still couldn’t swing it. I have the range of motion, but picking up my leg with my knee bent is still very painful on the inside of my knee where the procedure was performed. I can tell it’s only a matter of days until I can comfortably drive. One of the bigger improvements I’ve seen this week is that I now have the range of motion to be able to sit straight down on most chairs rather than having to move my surgical leg out in front first. It seems small, but it’s one less thing to be aware of.

Day 42 (6 weeks post-op):
I had a follow up with the surgeon at the beginning of the week. After checking my strength and range of motion he told me I could stop wearing the brace. I am still walking with a bit of a limp, but I’m able to walk longer distances comfortably. Driving is no longer painful. I have continued swimming for exercise and am able to do some limited kicking while I swim. PT has intensified to really start building strength. My scar is still sensitive, but I’m able to wear jeans without it getting too irritated. Going up stairs is slow but very doable. It is still painful to go down stairs so my PT has recommended going one stair at a time on my non-surgical leg for the time being.

Day 56 (8 weeks post-op): 
My day to day life is so close to being back to normal. My knee will get stiff, achy, and swollen after any significant walking (at the end of most days). I am walking and swimming mostly painless otherwise. It no longer hurts to get in and out of the car or drive. Going up stairs is relatively easy. Going down stairs is still slow going, but the pain has mostly subsided. My range of motion is also very close to matching my non-surgical leg. PT has advanced to include weights and machines.

Day 84 (12 Weeks Post-Op):
My day-to-day life is back to normal. I am back to walking my dog and walking to work normal. My range of motion matches my non-surgical leg. My knee still feels odd in that it will get sore, stiff, and swollen after a lot of activity, but I think that will be the case for a while. I can go up and down stairs pain free. My PT sessions are now mostly just workouts to improve strength. At my 3 month check in with my surgeon he recommended waiting another 2-3 months before I start doing any impact exercises (running/jumping). My scar isn’t sensitive anymore. I can’t kneel on my knee, but that’s pretty much the only complaint that affects my daily life still.

After a lot of trial and error, here are the 5 key things that finally made my tumbler work like it’s supposed to:

1. Always feed dry browns with your greens
For every bowl of veggie scraps or coffee grounds, I toss in a handful of shredded cardboard, paper egg cartons, or dry leaves. If you don’t balance your carbon:nitrogen ratio (ideally ~30:1), it turns into sludge fast.

2. Spin it 3–4 times every other day
Tumbler bins are aerobic systems they need oxygen. Turning every day just cools it down too much. Every other day worked best for me to keep the heat up and oxygen flowing.

3. Check the moisture it should feel like a wrung-out sponge

Too dry = slow breakdown. Too wet = stinky soup. If it’s too wet, add browns. Too dry? A light spray with the hose does wonders.

4. Add used coffee grounds to boost heat naturally
Coffee grounds are a great nitrogen source and help raise the internal temp of the pile. Just don’t overdo it they’re powerful.

5. Stop adding new scraps once it’s 2/3 full
At some point, you’ve gotta let it finish. Once the bin is around 2/3 full, I start a second tumbler or a holding bucket. That gives the first one time to fully break down without being constantly restarted.",8,1748453936.0,composting,7,1.0,False

A few cousins and uncles and some old army buddies as well.  An uncle called a few weeks ago and asked if his daughter (Gretta, 25) could stay with us for a week because she was coming to town to visit some uni friends.  I wasn't really onboard with the idea for a lot of reasons but I didn't totally object.  My husband only remembers her as a little kid from years ago and hasn't had any contact with her since.

Her flight landed late at night so we picked her up from the airport, brought her home and showed her her room along with showing her how to find things in the kitchen and her bathroom.  She immediately complained about our two dogs and I reminded her that we had told her father we had dogs and he said nothing.  She said it was ""assumed"" that we would board the dogs during her stay and I said that was totally unrealistic and if the dogs made her uncomfortable she could go to a hotel.  My husband and I just looked at each other.

My husband works all day and I work with horses so I'm away from the house frequently.  The following morning my husband had already left for work and I was getting ready to leave for an appointment.  Gretta walks into the kitchen and asks what we are having for breakfast. I told her we don't eat breakfast and she was free to make whatever she wanted, there was plenty of food in the fridge.  She then told me she doesn't know how to cook and her mother cooks for her all the time.  I told her throw some microwave sandwiches in to cook and I left.

When I got home three hours later all I could smell was smoke. She had managed to literally blow up the microwave by putting a metal pie plate in there and she burned the coffee pot.  She showed no remorse and blamed me for not fixing her breakfast.  I then found my dogs locked outside!  I had a fit and yelled at her about how she needs to learn to respect others' property and animals.  She stormed off to her bedroom like a two year old and called her father to complain about how we were treating her whereupon her father immediately began to berate me for not ""taking care of his daughter because that was my job"".  ???

I explained to him that she is 25 and shouldn't expect to be treated like a baby, and that I had no time to be ""taking care"" of her.  The agreement was she could stay with us for a week because she wanted to hang out with some old college friends.  I asked how she planned to go meet up with those friends - was she going to rent a car?  I'd be happy to take her to the local Hertz counter.  Then he tells me ""She doesn't know how to drive!  We assumed one of you two would take her wherever she wanted to go!""  Gretta then grabbed the phone and began screaming at him in German and then slammed her bedroom door.

I called my husband to reiterate everything that had transpired and even though he sounded shocked his only opinion was, ""Well, do the best you can.  I don't know what to say.  I'll be home later.""

A few minutes later Gretta came into the kitchen where I was trying my best to clean up the mess she made and she announced she had just talked to one of her friends who is expecting her to come over ""now"" so they could go out to lunch.  I told her I had a lot of cleaning to do and I also needed to go out to buy a new microwave.  I told her to take an Uber and explained what that was in case she had never heard of it.  I asked where the friend lived and almost fell over when she told me - it was 120 miles away!  I told her there was no way - at any point during the week - that I would be driving a 240 mile round trip and asked if they had even done research to see how far away these friends lived from me and she said, ""it shouldn't matter"".  

I asked her if she had a credit card and she did so I ordered her an Uber and put it on Daddy's card. He was less than pleased!

My husband got home before she did and I told him there was no way my nerves can take her for one more day.  He agreed but was a bit hesitant to call his uncle to tell him her trip is being cut short - but he did.  He changed her return flight and we were able to get her on a plane that night.

 Her dad was pissed though.  ""That's no way to treat a child! You can't possibly be a mother!""  I told him ""I am a wonderful mother - I brought my kids up to be totally self reliant.  They learned to drive, finish college, cook, and take care of their finances.  They each own their owned their own home before the age of 27. My son is an excellent cook and his house is immaculate.  My daughter can do electrical work and fix her own car. She is finishing her MBA. Look, I don't know how you bring up kids in Germany, but at 25 that kid should be able to take care of herself.""

Over the course of the next few weeks we were inundated with calls, emails and texts from other family over there who were ""shocked, dumbfounded, astounded, in total disbelief, and sadly dismayed"" at how this ""poor child"" was treated here.  

Believe me, I understand how to treat guests.  We have a large house and frequently have weekend guests.  But they are adults who don't expect to be waited on 24/7 and don't damage property.  However, the family concensus is that I was a horrible hostess and I'm even starting to doubt myself.

Was I really an a\*\*hole?

If you’ve been struggling with low energy, poor focus, or declining vitality, **you’re not alone**. I was in the same boat—tired, stressed, and simply surviving. That is, until I discovered **MITOLYN**, a breakthrough supplement that truly **changed everything** for me.

Today, I’m writing this detailed MITOLYN review not just as a satisfied customer—but as someone who finally feels in control of their life and health again.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ✅ Week 1:

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

Friend trip FROM H*LL… I don’t know if it’s me but I just CANT HAVE A FRIEND. 
Me and my friend met on Bumble FRIENDS Oct 2024. Went on small trips since then, but none overnight. We’ve had like one hiccup. But it was on her and she apologized and we moved past it. We had our girls trip this Memorial Day weekend. Exciting right?… I knew it was a sign when I got a kidney infection the week before, hurt to stand for too long and was living on pain killer just to make it through the day. 

So, my main thing I wanted to get a mouth grill on the trip, she decided she wanted one too I was so happy she wanted one w me. 
That’s all we had planned the arrival day of the trip and then just go out to a bar for food. 
When we picked it up, mine didn’t fit right and I had to get it adjusted and she literally had an attitude and was acting irritable. Like what, am I not suppose to make sure it fits?! Anyways, So we ended up going out, wore heels(bad idea) and she decided to recruit these girls and basically we followed them around all night. They were Spanish, they only went to Spanish clubs and it was $20 for every club we went in. Well after so many clubs I got tired of paying money to hear the same song BASICALLY because we both like r&b and the clubs were spaced out my feet were killing me and here too. But she wanted to, so I was like whatever cool. So, then she says I have an attitude, which I told her I didn’t but my feet were hurting and so were hers I told her I want her to enjoy herself and she seemed really into the other girls(no hate, I’m an introvert mostly but I do party). 
So next day (10 am we got up) she was grouchy as hell like a kid she says “you had an attitude and your vibe was off” I swear I repeated 4 times my feet were hurting and I was ok with staying just wanted to sit or not walk to so many bars. I was dancing, twirling, twirling her, dancing w the other girls and all. That night she even stuck sticks her lips out to kiss me, I decline and play it off and we continue w the night. Didn’t think there was an issue. 

We went to brunch she had an attitude the whole time. Complained about the prices, menus ($15-30 which is normal where we are). I started talking to the waitress on cool places to go, she had an attitude? But she talks to EVERYONE. 

We went to see the butterflies, mind you I hate bugs, and didn’t wanna pay $15 to hold in a scream because I don’t do bugs 😂 but I did it for her. She likes nature. She was tired/grouchy on the way there and even while there! It was a 20+ min walk to get there and it was silent, awkward and I got tired of asking her if she’s ok, felt like I was babysitting. I tried to make the most of it. We were done in like 10 mins but went back through. I asked for pics and she would act like she was bothered. But I willingly took her pics and even offered and told her were to stand and helped her pose. We left in silent, she asked me to take her to get coffee, I said ok. Whole time she is huffing and puffing and atp I’m so irritated. 

She said she wanted to take a nap, I’m thinking “ugh we on vacation let’s make the most of the time” but then I’m like she need to be in a better mood before I really get unbearably irritated. So, we napped. Went out that night, we went in a club, I told her I had to use the bathroom (mind you I’m recovering from a kidney infection and possibly have a kidney stone one night I was in such pain I was sweating) she gets irritated and says you always have to go to the bathroom.. ok? So I come out and ask her if she wants to take a pic, music so loud I can’t hear her response and she rolls her eyes at me. ATP, I said “look I don’t know what your problem is but it’s not with me, so fix it” eventually she did. We continue, I let it go. We go to a club, and dance she sticks her lips out for a kiss. I laugh it off. She swears I’m brushing up against her breast/private area  on purpose, I never noticed.  I was like “girl HAHA no I didn’t” 
When we get out the club, a guy looks at me and she got upset basically saying “omg the way these men are looking at you are bugging me, their so thirsty like your a piece of meat” and she said it in a jealous way as if we are together. I said “I think your the only one who notices that, I don’t even be paying attention I came to have a girls trip not to find a man” She would talk to guys the whole time out there and flirt, keep saying she wanna hook up, I told her “do you if that’s what you want but I know something quick isn’t what you want truly”. I just wanted her to make sure her head was in the right place before having a one night stand. When men would talk to me I’d look at her to check in and she would roll her eyes. She told me I was too shy and when I tried to step out of my comfort I got rude, cold shoulder vibes. She made a comment that I was too tipsy in the moment to catch fully but said if I ever tried anything  her she would be like “omg yes, please”. And she did “try” to get me to kiss her 3-4 times over the weekend. 

I’m not sure if she felt rejected, jealous or just wanted to be hateful and difficult. I’m learning towards ALL THE ABOVE!! She was unpleasant 90% of the time when I think about it. She was huffing and puffing all day, snappy. I got so tired of asking her if she was ok because HER mood was off. I feel like I over accommodated her. I paid $100 in parking for the 3 days we were they. Never complained, she only gave me half($18) once. She said we had to slow down the spending, I never complained about the prices of where we ate/did. She gets paid 3 times a month and told me that. I really felt like a big girl this trip because I wanted to pop her in the mouth, call me a bad friend but I was a great friend. I thought maybe because she was on her period but as grown adults who can manage and somewhat understand our feelings AND moods, that’s ridiculous.",2,1748453722.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

But then, I discovered **MITOLYN** — and everything changed.

# 🌿 Why I Tried MITOLYN

Like many others, I was dealing with **fatigue**, mental fog, poor digestion, and an overall lack of motivation. I wasn’t ""sick"" per se, but I certainly wasn’t thriving either. Coffee had stopped working, and no amount of diet changes or workouts helped for long.

I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** through a recommendation in a health forum. People were raving about it. Not influencers. **Real people**. That got my attention.

# 🔍 What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average multivitamin or caffeine-loaded pill. It’s a **mitochondrial support supplement**—designed to rejuvenate your cells, boost energy production, and restore biological balance at the **deepest cellular level**.

It uses advanced ingredients that work synergistically to support **mitochondrial health**, which is the **core power center** of every cell in your body. If your mitochondria are tired, **you’re tired.** MITOLYN fixes that.

# 🧪 The Ingredients: Science-Backed & Potent

I did my research before trying MITOLYN. I was blown away by the ingredient list. It's packed with:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** – a rare compound proven to stimulate new mitochondria growth.
* **CoQ10** – boosts energy and heart health.
* **NAD+ precursors** – essential for anti-aging and cellular repair.
* **Magnesium, Zinc, and other vital minerals** – for metabolic function and nervous system support.

These are not filler ingredients — these are the real deal. The dosage is optimal, the blend is synergistic, and it’s **100% natural and free from GMOs, soy, gluten, or artificial junk.**

# Week 2:

I was sleeping deeper, my digestion improved noticeably, and my brain fog started to lift. Tasks that felt heavy were now easy. I was **more productive** without caffeine or sugar.

# Week 3:

I started going for walks again. My body felt **lighter**, more capable. My motivation came back. I also noticed I wasn’t getting my usual afternoon crashes. MITOLYN was now part of my daily routine.

# 🤔 Is MITOLYN a Scam?

And unlike many sketchy supplements online, MITOLYN has **transparent labeling**, third-party testing, and an **iron-clad money-back guarantee**.

Hi! I’m Elle. I LOVE roleplaying romance, but I prefer playing MxM. However, I am willing to play MxF, where I play the male, if the plot is good enough :) (Warning, though, I have very little experience with it lol)

Something about me:

•I’m under 18, so if you contact me, please be under 18 as well

• I enjoy fantasy roleplays as well as slice of life, but mainly enjoy more realistic roleplays 

• I usually write 1-3 paragraphs, but I can write more to match you!

•I roleplay mostly on discord!

• I am in the GMT+2 time zone and I would consider myself as a relatively active person, since I am able to respond quite often throughout the day

• I tend to match the writing style and length of my roleplaying partner, meaning if you write 2 sentences or two paragraphs, I’ll match you!

• I want to have fun! If you’re not constantly online, no worries! Please just let me know if you’re gonna be gone for a while

•this should be fun for both of us. I want to get to know you and get along with you so that we can roleplay better together :)

• I really enjoy all types of romance tropes! Feel free to make suggestions for the roleplay and let your imagination run wild! My favorite tropes are enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, slice of life or things similar to that

• please don’t feel pressured to write long or detailed responses, I know life can be busy, but do try to at least write a few sentences at the minimum


We can create our own plot or use one of the following short ideas and add onto it!

**apocolypse au**

In a world where a deadly disease is spreading all over the world, very few people are left alive. Our two characters meet each other and decide to try and work together in order to survive while falling in love in the process. 

**royalty au**

A war between two kingdoms bring two princes together. They have to work together to find a way to end the war and fall in love as they spend more time together 

**slice of life**

A slice of life roleplay with one of the following tropes:

• bodyguard x celebrity
•coffee shop owner x regular customer
• friends to lovers
•forbidden love
•enemies to lovers

And anything else you can think of, we can discuss!

Those were just a few short ideas, but I’m willing to listen to any idea you may have! We can discuss adding on things and making our own world together as well :)

After sharing my earlier thoughts about wanting to experience life as my feminine self (born male) in a new, judgment-free city, I've been feeling even more inspired to make that dream a reality.

Now, I’m looking to take a small but meaningful step: I’m hoping to connect with a kind-hearted woman who would be open to being friends with me and helping me explore and express the feminine side of myself in real life. I am single guy! Open for relationship. Whether that means going shopping together, helping each other navigate life, giving fashion or makeup tips, just chatting over coffee, or offering guidance on presenting more femininely- I'm deeply appreciative of any support.

I’m totally open to this being a friendly connection, but I also understand time and energy are valuable—so I’m even open to compensating someone for their time if that makes this more comfortable.

This is a really vulnerable but exciting step for me, and I’d love to do it with someone who’s kind, open-minded, and maybe even curious to share in this journey.

I tried everything you can imagine—expensive supplements, detox drinks, gym memberships, meditation apps… nothing worked long term.

That was until I stumbled upon something that would completely flip the switch on my health, focus, and energy.

I’m talking about **MITOLYN**.

And if you’re reading this right now, I want you to pay attention. Because this isn’t just another overhyped product. MITOLYN delivered real, tangible, life-changing results for me—and it might do the same for you.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average health supplement. It’s a scientifically formulated mitochondrial enhancer that works at a **cellular level**. While most supplements only mask the symptoms of fatigue or brain fog, MITOLYN goes straight to the root cause—**your mitochondria**, the energy factories of your cells.

When your mitochondria are sluggish, you feel sluggish. When they’re powered up, you become unstoppable.

MITOLYN is designed to **optimize mitochondrial function**, restore natural energy, sharpen focus, and improve overall vitality—without caffeine crashes or artificial junk.

# 🔬 What Happened When I Started Taking MITOLYN

Let me walk you through my personal experience, step by step.

**Day 1-3:**  
I honestly didn’t expect much at first. I took 2 capsules with my morning water. Within a couple of hours, I felt… a little clearer. A slight lift in my brain fog. I was cautiously optimistic.

**Day 4-7:**  
This is where things got exciting. I was waking up before my alarm—**without the usual grogginess**. I didn’t crave afternoon naps or extra caffeine. I actually wanted to work. I was productive, focused, and surprisingly calm under pressure.

**Week 2:**  
My body started to feel lighter, more agile. My mental clarity was through the roof. Even my digestion improved. Friends noticed I looked “fresh” and asked if I was doing something different. The **confidence boost** that came with this transformation was priceless.

**Week 3 and beyond:**  
I became a different person. **Motivated, balanced, full of life**. The fatigue that once held me back was replaced by a flow of energy that made every day feel exciting.

MITOLYN didn’t just help me feel better—it helped me perform better.

# 💡 Why MITOLYN Works (When Other Products Fail)

I’ve taken dozens of supplements over the years. Most are filled with empty promises. But MITOLYN is **backed by real science**. Here’s what makes it stand out:

* **Mitochondrial Support Formula** – It works at the cellular level, restoring the very source of your body’s energy.
* **Clean Ingredients** – No fillers, no sketchy chemicals, no artificial stimulants. Just powerful, natural compounds.
* **Zero Crash** – The energy boost is clean, consistent, and long-lasting.
* **Brain & Body Benefits** – It improves not just physical energy, but also mental clarity, mood, and focus.

The results weren’t “overnight magic,” but within days, I could tell something inside me was waking up.

**Why This Pick?**

I’ll be frank: I don’t love either pitcher on the mound today. Mariners starter George Kirby (12.27 ERA) had a rough season debut, and the Nationals are rolling with Trevor Williams this evening who’s boasting an ERA of 6.39. The reason for this pick? I know the Nationals haven’t scored more than 6 runs over their last 4 outings, but something tells me they’ll be able to put more than a few on the board against Kirby. In addition, the Seattle offense is wide awake, and should have no issue bagging runs with Williams on the mound. I say both teams contribute to this total and the Over cashes.

1kxn5p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1kxn5p8/a_beautiful_day_begins/,A Beautiful Day Begins,"**with a Beautiful Mindset**

Every day offers us a fresh canvas, waiting for our brush to paint it with the colors of our thoughts and emotions. When the sun rises and casts its warm glow upon the world, it's more than just the start of another day—it’s an opportunity, a privilege, and a moment to embrace life. The adage ""A beautiful day begins with a beautiful mindset"" encapsulates the essence of how our perceptions influence our experiences.

### The Power of Perspective

Imagine waking up, the soft light filtering through your curtains, the chirping of birds outside your window. Instead of jumping straight into the rush of daily tasks, take a moment to breathe. Reflect on the simple yet profound reality of being alive and healthy. This simple act of gratitude can shift your entire perspective. When we acknowledge the privileges we often take for granted—our health, our relationships, the changing seasons—we begin to cultivate a mindset of appreciation.

Research in positive psychology consistently highlights the benefits of gratitude. Embracing a grateful mindset not only enhances our emotional well-being but also enriches our relationships and even our physical health. Acknowledging life's blessings reminds us that every day holds potential, and with that recognition comes the power to transform ordinary moments into extraordinary memories.

### Shifting from Routine to Ritual

Taking a moment to acknowledge our privilege can change how we approach our day. Instead of viewing your morning routine as just another task, treat it as a cherished ritual. Whether it’s a hot cup of coffee, a leisurely stretch, or a few moments of meditation, approach these activities with mindfulness. 

This mindful practice allows us to fully immerse in the experience, enhancing its significance. You might find joy in the aroma of your morning beverage, the stillness of the early hours, or the sheer beauty of nature as it awakens. When we engage in our morning rituals with intention, we set a positive tone for the day—a tone that resonates with appreciation and joy.

### The Ripple Effect of Positivity

When you start your day with a mindset focused on beauty and gratitude, you not only elevate your own experience but also impact those around you. Positivity is contagious. A smile, a kind word, or an act of gratitude can create a ripple effect in your community. As you interact with others, you may find that your optimistic energy shines through, uplifting not only your spirit but also that of colleagues, friends, and family.

Consider this: when you meet each day with appreciation, you become a beacon of hope and positivity. Your mindset can inspire others to recognize their own privileges and blessings, creating an environment where mindfulness and appreciation flourish. 

### Embracing Challenges as Opportunities

Life is not without its challenges. However, a beautiful mindset allows you to perceive difficulties as opportunities for growth. When faced with obstacles, instead of succumbing to frustration or despair, ask yourself, “What can I learn from this? How can this challenge elevate my understanding or strengthen my character?” 

This shift in thinking transforms setbacks into stepping stones. It fosters resilience, allowing you to navigate the complexity of life with grace and determination. Ultimately, viewing challenges through this lens can deepen our appreciation for the journey—reminding us that even the tough days have their lessons, contributing to an enriched life experience.

### Concluding Thoughts

In conclusion, a beautiful day truly begins with a beautiful mindset. By waking each morning and recognizing the privilege we have to be alive and healthy, we unlock the door to a life filled with appreciation and joy. Time spent living is indeed time worth appreciating. Each moment harbors the potential for beauty, if only we choose to see it.

As you begin tomorrow, I invite you to take a moment to acknowledge your blessings. Embrace the day with an open heart and a grateful spirit, for in doing so, you will find that life is not just a series of routines, but a beautiful tapestry of experiences waiting to be appreciated fully. **Let each day be a testament to the beauty within and around you.**

1kxn5kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1kxn5kd/how_to_deal_with_friendships_growing_apart/,How to deal with friendships growing apart?,"Hi, first time posting in this sub but needing some advice. Mainly for the last couple years (26F) I’ve been feeling as if my friendships have been lacking. My friendships have had a wean/wane process. Sometimes we talk consistently whether that’s every other day, once a week etc to not talking at all for months. I totally understand that going through hard times and becoming an adult and dealing with all those struggles can cause you to be not as present. For the longest time, this was okay with me. Sometimes I would even do it too, especially if life was getting really rough. So I have been partially complicit in that. However if you want me to be honest, I honestly am feeling like I was only ever okay with that type of friendship dynamic because I sincerely thought that’s the only way adult friendships had to be. But if I’m being honest, I grew up watching my mom call or hangout with her friends weekly, while she was married with 3 kids. Even if they didn’t hang out physically, they were communicating with each other by a phone call or message. I don’t think the excuse of marriage/long term relationship, having kids or being too busy is an excuse anymore. For some period of time sure, we all go through rough patches in life and may not be the best at communicating but I feel if my friendships were actually adequate currently, I wouldn’t constantly feel so lonely and like I don’t have anyone to talk to. I shouldn’t be feeling this way almost the whole entire year, right? I remember my mom would have conversations with me about how you make time for who and what you want to make time for. I’m not okay that my friends don’t make any time for me. With one of my friends we tried to set up weekly phone calls on a certain day of the week. That worked for maybe about a month and then we would only ever talk if I was the one to call. No initiative from the other friend to call even though we had a scheduled/set day in time. I don’t get invited to birthdays, I don’t really know what’s going on in their life half the time, except for when we finally catch up a couple months later and they tell me. Most of my “friends” live 30min-1hr away from me (metropolitan area so that’s not long/far where i’m from at all) my daughter is 2.5 and most have never met her, just came to my baby shower. I have said outright that we should plan time to get up to meet together, make time to hang out, have brunch dates, lunch, literally anything and the usual response is convincing me that’s something they’re wanting to do but it never happens. I’m tired of making excuses for them. Most of them were some of my best friends or closest friends years ago, but I’m tired of lying to myself and trying to convince myself I’m still important to this people. If I were to explain my friendships dynamics to most people, they would ask me if I’m sure these people are my friends lol. They may love me, but I’m not any type of importance in their lives anymore. You outgrew people and that’s okay, but I have absolutely no idea how to make new friends. Like at all, I’ve had the same “friends” for years. I don’t need a friend that talks to me every day or needs to be all up under my ass. But maybe a friend that talks or checks up on me at least once a week or two weeks and I can do the same for them. Someone who I can ask if they’d want to get together occasionally for brunch, lunch, coffee or drinks. Even if it’s only for an hour or less lol. I just don’t want friends that I am constantly feeling disconnected from, you know. Am I wrong? Am I asking for too much? I feel closer to the old versions of them and not the current versions. Usually when I try to initiate these things, I get told or hinted something along the lines of expecting too much or them being “too busy” for those types of things but they still care about me. I know all friendships aren’t long lasting but most of mine have seem to outgrown me (and I guess I’m just now catching on) Is that really how it is? Am I expecting too much from friends?

We used to be really spontaneous—last-min plans, road trips, late-night hangouts, all of it. But she had twins 2 yrs ago and obv her life changed, which I totally get. I’ve tried to be there—babysat, brought food, always tried to work around her schedule.

Lately tho, it feels like everything is on her terms. She’ll text me like “can you come over now?” cuz her husband’s running late or she needs help with the kids. Or she’ll say “let’s have coffee!” but only if it’s at her place during nap time—then gets interrupted a million times. Anytime I suggest meeting up outside her house or planning ahead, she just says it’s impossible.

Last weekend I had plans to visit my parents. The night before, she texted that her sitter bailed and asked if I could come watch the twins “just for a few hrs.” I told her I couldn’t—I was packed and leaving early the next morning. She hit back with “Seriously? You’re choosing your parents over helping your best friend in a crisis? Some friend you are.”

Now I feel super guilty, cuz I know she’s overwhelmed. But I also feel like I don’t matter unless I’m available at a moment’s notice. And when I’m not, she makes me feel like crap for it.

Her family thought this was a terrible idea and that was precisely why she knew it was a good one.

It was surprisingly inexpensive to acquire one—but after that the real work began. Supplies, repairs, figuring out how the hell to make bread. But that first loaf that came out perfectly…

“I am crone, and I am free!” she shouted to the wind.

She hiked down to the village every other day and gradually crowded her cottage shelves with teacups in every colour along with trinkets that served no purpose but to please her. She filled her pantry with everything she needed by week, made glorious soups and greeted every morning sunrise from her bath near the largest window.

Then she started to paint.

She had collected every colour, her true purpose in coming to this little cottage life. Now the colours needed out.

The hours alone, colour her only companion, made her feel just as she had imagined they would.

She had just one neighbour, Hal, a salt-and-pepper fellow of five words or less. This suited her just fine. She had not come all the way up a mountain for company.

“I have a freshwater spring on my side,” he informed her on their first meeting. “Had a deal with the last tenant to bring some over every other day. You interested?”

She was. Hal treated it himself. It was a luxury to replace the boiled tap water she currently endured.

“I am not the tenant,” she informed him. “I’m the owner.”

Hal looked at all the half-started repairs, then at Sophie with her graying bun and sniffed, “I give you two weeks.”

The next time he came he caught her on the phone. It was not easy to operate a phone this far from civilization. Sophie had hoped it would be more of a deterrent then it was proving to be.

“I hear you, yes,” she said, trying to wrap it up as Hal quietly waited on her tiny veranda. “But the *point* is for you not to know where I am.”

She listened patiently to the complaints of several people on the other end.

“I’m sure you’d like to visit, but I don’t wish to be visited.”

Then she hung up the phone with a firm click. The window was wide open. She knew Hal heard everything. He said nothing about it as he put the water on her counter with strong arms. Then he slowly took stock of the sink repairs she was attempting.

“You’ve got the elbow upside down,” he said.

He picked up the spare she had on the counter.

“It goes like this,” he showed her, turning it upside down.

She quietly swore. She had tried everything but that.

“Would you like some soup?” she asked him. “With bread?”

“You made bread?” he asked then seemed to regret blurting it, his enthusiasm for bread out before he could stop it.

She smiled and cut them both a slice, then ladled them each a nice bowl of soup.

He sat down across from her at her counter, pushing the pipe repair pieces aside and took in the rest of the cottage. Today was a red day. She had her little red teacup out and a teapot with strawberries on it, wore a red sweater over her dress and had the sofa cushions, blanket and flowers in her place all red as well.

His eyebrows gave away the expression his beard tried to hide.

“Is it always going to be red now?”

Sophie laughed.

“No, just today.”

“What will tomorrow be?”

“I let the sunrise decide,” she told him.

Those eyebrows lifted.

“Free to change colours,” she murmured into her red teacup. “Do you ever change yours?”

He gave a huff of almost laughter, “A source of complaint in my previous life was that I never do. I am as you see me, and nothing more.”

Sophie studied his colours as he trekked the narrow, winding path away from her cottage and back to his. Hal was firm, solid, forest neutrals, as solitary as the trees around him and as plain as the stone. The way he belonged to the mountain made him peaceful to be around. That was his colour, she decided. His colour was peace.

Soon the cottage was crowded with paintings: teacups and skies, flowers and trees, pies and bread. Sophie painted everything, every treasure the mountain and her life here brought her. The steam from a good cuppa. The clouds after a storm. The little vines on the rockface of the mountain.

Hal stayed every other day for lunch, sometimes reading a book while she painted. He wore green on a green day some weeks later and laughed in delight.

“Well, lookee here, I match the day, do I?”

Sophie shook her head at him as she ladled soup into two green bowls.

“Why are you up here?” he asked her as they ate. “There’s a lot of places a person could escape to,” he added cautiously.

He didn’t ask much, honestly. His comfortable silences had come to be one of her mountain treasures. They shifted colour to match whatever day she found herself in. That peace a neutral that belonged to every colour.

“Back home I lived in grays,” she said simply. “And not just around my family. Being crowded…it doesn’t suit me. Up here I can be every colour, as often as I please.”

Hal said nothing to this but invited her to hike around to his side sometime and watch the sunset. His cottage was very like him, stoic and minimal with a solid wood veranda looking out to the horizon. The woodwork all done by hand.

He fussed and cursed as he walked her back around through the dark.

“Don’t push it—”

“Sophie, mind the edge—”

“For christsakes it’s *dark* Sophie—”

And Sophie realized she had made a friend.

Her mountain life was all very peaceful until the day she took some of her paintings into town to see if anyone wanted them. They turned out to be quite popular and she returned to the cottage empty-handed, thrilled to tell Hal her cherished hobby had given her some pocket money and brought a little joy.

But the next day, Deidre Green hiked all the way up the mountain from the village, holding one of Sophie’s paintings of a teacup and banged down the door to be let in. She barged in, ignoring Hal’s, “Only *you* would think it’s your *right* to be let in Deidre Green!” and propped the painting in a chair.

“Watch this!” Deidre declared.

Then she reached her hand *into the painting,* and retrieved the cup of tea, pulling it out steaming and very real. She took a sip.

“It’s delicious! Your paintings are *magic*!”

The idea of magic had always delighted Sophie, but she had never seen any real magic of her own—just the suggestion of it in beautiful things. This irrefutable proof was absolutely wild.

The magic seemed to last as long as the paintings did. Sophie was inundated with requests: gorgeous beaches, stunning ballrooms, highly specific cakes, jewelry, clothes. The villagers wanted it all. Hal watched her paint until she was exhausted, and his grump since the discovery of her magic intensified.

“They can *wait,* Sophie,” he growled one particularly bad day when an unexpected downpour set her back on her latest beach painting before she hurried it inside. “Don’t lose your joy of it.”

She burned a soup and ruined a bread and forgot to pick a new colour one morning. She was quite flush with cash, which was unexpected. Hal caught her counting it one morning, her mouth hanging open in disbelief.

“Oh, well, counting up your *earnings, are you*?” he barked. “I supposed you will head off to be rich and famous now with your new *gift*!”

Sophie gaped at him in surprise.

“What on earth? No. I thought I might improve the pipes though. Get some reliable plumbing at last. Improve that big window I love.”

“You can’t be serious,” he scoffed.

“Are you saying you’d miss me?” she teased.

“I said no such thing.”

But he had. He had. Sophie gave him a sidelong look.

“Why haven’t *you* asked me for a painting?”

“Why haven’t you made *yourself* a painting?” he countered.

Sophie sat back in her chair, “The real art is *being here*,” she said. “I want the real thing, not an imitation of it.”

Hal hesitated, his steaming coffee in his hands. He rarely hesitated about anything.

“That’s why I’m up here,” he said quietly. “I want the real things—not the imitations.”

That understanding, Sophie realized, was a treasure she didn’t know she needed.

The next day, she finally caught up with her long list of commissions. She flopped down on her sofa—yellow everything today—and took a nap. When Hal hiked over, she had no lunch ready, but he surprised her with a travel container of piping hot stew.

“I’m no chef,” he warned. “But I had a feeling you wouldn’t cook today. You had, what, fifteen left?”

She nodded, exhausted.

“I’m taking a break,” she said. “Actually, a full hiatus, possibly retirement.”

“Good.”

She waited until the stew was cleaned away and their cherished comfortable silence had soothed all her nerves. Hal often brought a book. His cottage was full of them. They were his treasures. He was reading one now, his glasses low on his nose, his feet on her coffee table.

“I made you one,” she said.

“Made me what?”

“A painting.”

He looked startled.

“Why?”

“I want you to have this one.”

“You shouldn’t have,” he said gruffly, his beard hiding his real feelings.

“It’s a bit big, I can help you carry it home if you like.”

She walked out with it and watched him study it long and hard.

“Is this a joke?” he asked.

“It is not,” she confirmed.

“Sophie, it’s blank.”

“It’s not blank.”

“There are no colours,” he said. “Is that how you think of me?”

“I want you to hang it up when you get home,” she said.

He looked very offended. Snatched it from her hands.

“Fine.”

He accepted no help carrying it awkwardly the long hike back around to his cottage and all Sophie could do was wait. And hope.

The time passed that was Hal’s usual hike home. Sophie went to the little hall between her rooms where she had hung a matching canvas to the one she gifted Hal. She waited. And waited.

Finally, the canvas shifted, just as she’d hoped it would when she painted it. A moment later Hal was staring back at her through the painting, as though a door had opened between their cottages, as easily as if they were a room apart.

Sophie grinned.

“You didn’t…” Hal gasped.

“I did,” she confirmed. “Now you can come whenever you like. Watch the sunrise *and* the sunset. Match whatever colour takes my fancy—if you want to?” she finished uncertainly.

Maybe she’d gone too far.

But Hal’s face slowly bloomed into a delight his beard could not hide. She had made more than a friend. The best surprise of this cottage life. A better magic than her colours becoming enchanted paintings. This was a colour with no name.

“I want to,” he said, and stepped through to meet her.",1,1748453469.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

One day, without warning, a very famous currently living celebrity — an A-list actor, global pop star, legendary supermodel, etc. — is completely wiped from public memory. Their fame, influence, and career? Gone. Never happened. There’s no scandal or cancelation — it’s like they were never famous in the first place.

But you still remember everything.
Now they’re just a regular person living in their country of origin or home state, doing whatever they might have done if they’d never gotten famous — maybe working retail, teaching school, or bartending. They’ve even got a barely followed Instagram account, just like any ordinary person.

Because you were a big enough fan, you know where they’re from. You know how to find them — maybe their new IG has a selfie tagged at a local coffee shop, or a friend’s page shows them hanging out at a dive bar you could casually visit.
 
So here's the question:
Would you go out of your way to meet them? Would you try to strike up a conversation, become friends, or see if something more could spark — all while they have no idea, they used to be world-famous?

1kxms4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/immunitysupplement/comments/1kxms4l/sumatonic_vs_coffee_which_kept_me_alert_without/,SumaTonic Vs. Coffee: Which Kept Me Alert Without The Crash?,"**SumaTonic Vs. Coffee: Which Kept Me Alert Without The Crash?**

In the quest for maintaining high energy levels throughout the day, many people turn to coffee. However, I've recently explored an alternative: SumaTonic. Both of these energizers are popular, but how do they compare in terms of alertness and the dreaded post-consumption crash?

Coffee, a staple in many households, is well-known for its caffeine content. A single cup can jolt you awake, providing that quick burst of energy needed to kickstart your day. However, as effective as it can be, coffee often comes with a downside—an energy crash after a few hours. This crash can lead to feelings of fatigue and irritability, making it necessary to reach for another cup or sugary snacks for a pick-me-up.

On the other hand, SumaTonic promises a more sustained energy boost, thanks to its adaptogenic properties. Made from a blend of natural herbs and nutrients, SumaTonic is designed to enhance endurance, reduce fatigue, and support mental clarity. Many users report a more gradual onset of energy that lasts throughout the day without the jittery feeling often associated with coffee.

When I tried both, the differences were palpable. Coffee initially provided a sharp increase in alertness, making it easier to tackle morning tasks. However, about two hours later, I felt somewhat drained. In contrast, SumaTonic kept me alert without excessive stimulation, and I found myself more focused over a longer period.


Coffee: Quick energy boost, high caffeine, potential for crash.
SumaTonic: Gradual energy release, natural ingredients, sustained alertness.


Ultimately, for those looking to maintain alertness without the highs and lows, SumaTonic may be the superior choice. Its natural formulation provides a smooth energy curve, making it an attractive alternative for anyone hesitant about the jitteriness and subsequent crash that coffee can bring.

Alright, friends, let’s be real for a second. How many times have you found yourself trapped in a meeting that could’ve been an email? 😩 You show up, sip your lukewarm coffee, and wonder why you even bothered putting on pants for this. If meetings had a slogan, it would probably be “I'm here, but I have no idea why.” 

Not too long ago, I was in the same boat. My calendar looked like a game of Tetris gone wrong—total chaos! Then I discovered something that changed everything: **the 10-Second Rule**. I know, it sounds simple, but hear me out! 

### Here’s how it works: 

1. **Before every meeting, ask yourself: “Is it necessary?”**
   - If it’s just a catch-up, can you do it over coffee or a quick chat?
   - Consider the *real* purpose of the meeting. Is it just a “status update” that could be emailed instead?

2. **Set a timer for 10 seconds.**
   - When it starts feeling pointless, hit pause. You’d be surprised at what you can cut out in those 10 seconds. This is your mental reset button!

3. **Identify the key players.** 
   - *Who really needs to be there?* If a person’s presence isn’t crucial, don't feel bad about leaving them off the list. Fewer people = more meaningful conversations. 

4. **Introduce the “5-minute rule.”** 
   - Since we're all busy bees, kick off any meeting with an agenda and stick to it. If you find yourself drifting off-topic, bring it back! 

5. **Use “stand-up” meetings.** 
   - Literally. Get everyone to stand. You’d be shocked how quickly you can wrap things up when no one’s sitting comfortably. 😄

I started using this rule about three months ago and *wow*, my calendar has shrunk significantly! I traded in hours of pointless conversations for quality work time. What a wild concept, right? 

### Why does this work? 

- **Focus:** You’re not just *attending*—you’re actively participating. 
- **Awareness:** You start thinking critically about your time and where it goes. 
- **Freedom:** Less time in meetings = more time to relax or tackle those daunting to-do lists.

But here’s the kicker: it’s not just about cutting down your calendar. It’s about MAKING every minute count. Ask yourself: *can I bring this energy into other areas of my life?* 🤔 

So, have any of you tried something similar to regain your time? Maybe you have your own tricks to combat meeting overload? Let’s hear them! 💬",1,1748452480.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1kxmpih,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1kxmpih/to_the_city_that_held_my_heart/,To the city that held my heart❤️,"I don’t usually write things like this, but today my heart’s full and I feel the need to let it out somewhere. So here’s a letter, not just to a city, but to a memory. A dream. A “what if.”

I’m just a boy from Kerala. I came to Hyderabad to chase a career, to work, to grow. I never imagined I would end up falling for someone or for the city itself.

She was from here. A Telugu girl with a heart so pure, it left me stunned. She was the one who proposed to me first. To this day, I don’t know what she saw in me. Maybe she saw the quiet in me and felt safe there. She was the most genuine soul I’ve ever met. Innocent, kind, thoughtful just… love in human form.

And I? I was scared. Scared of commitment, scared of the differences between us, scared of giving her hope I wasn’t sure I could keep. So I stayed silent, even as my heart screamed. I didn’t tell her how I felt not in time.

But we shared moments that I’ll never forget. Long talks over coffee. Random evening breaks that became the highlight of my days. And one unforgettable visit to Chowmahalla Palace, dressed like royalty, standing side by side. She looked like a princess. And for a moment, I dared to feel like her prince. Just for a moment.

But life has a way of pulling people apart, even when they fit. She’s with someone else now. She moved on. And I left Hyderabad a year ago.

Still, not a day goes by when I don’t think of her or of that city that made me feel things I’d never felt before. Hyderabad was more than a city to me. It was where I smiled the most, and where I hurt the deepest.

To her thank you for loving me even when I didn’t know how to love you back. You were magic, and I hope you’ve found someone who sees that every single day. I’m happy for you. Genuinely.

To Hyderabad thank you for holding our story. For the palace, the coffee, the quiet laughter, and the bittersweet silence. You may no longer be my present, but you will always be my favorite chapter.

Sometimes, we don’t get to keep what we love. Sometimes, we just get to remember it.

Hey, MaximizeMe friends!

Ever feel like you're on top of the world in the morning, only to crash around 3 PM like you just ran a marathon? **Me too!** 🥴 That notorious afternoon slump can be brutal. But guys, what if I told you there's a super simple hack that resets your nervous system and helps you beat that nasty crash? Enter: Box Breathing. 🟦

**Wait, what's Box Breathing?**  
Good question! It’s this neat technique Navy SEALs swear by, used to calm nerves and stay focused. Basically:

1. **Inhale** for 4 seconds.  
2. **Hold** that breath for 4 seconds.  
3. **Exhale** slowly for 4 seconds.  
4. **Hold** again for 4 seconds.  
*Repeat.* 

Sounds simple, right? But wow, what a game-changer! 🙌

**Here’s how my week went:**

- **Day 1:** Felt weird. I mean, who knew breathing could feel like such an Olympic sport? 😅 But once I got past the initial awkwardness, *there it was* – brief moments of clarity amidst my usual foggy brain.

- **Mid-week:** By Day 3, something clicked. I didn't just avoid my dreaded slump; I felt rejuvenated, like a shot of espresso without the jitters. ☕️

- **Day 7:** Let me tell you, friends, I didn’t just *survive* the week; I actually thrived. By now, I’d turned Box Breathing into a sort of mini escape during my breaks, and holy moly, my productivity soared. Shareholders meeting? Passed with flying colors! 🎤😎

**A few things I noticed:**

- It’s like hitting the *reset button* on your mind.
- You'll suddenly realize you've been shallow breathing your whole life. 🤯
- My energy levels? Stable AF. I didn’t reach for that second (or third) cup of coffee!

So, why does this matter? Our bodies produce cortisol when we're stressed or tired, and that pesky hormone plays a big role in how we feel during the afternoon. Box Breathing seems to regulate it, at least for me, which helps in getting through the day focused and energized.

Look, I’m not saying it’s a magic pill – it takes practice. But if you're battling the afternoon zombie apocalypse like I was, give Box Breathing a shot (or breath?) for a week and watch what happens.

Who knew the *secret weapon* could be lurking right under our noses? 😏

They work directly with producers like Edilson Cifuentes and source through the LaREB cooperative in Colombia, ensuring transparency and a high return to the farmers.

I was going really well for almost 4 months. Then I took a sip of my girlfriend's coffee. Then I convinced myself one cup a day was fine and something I could manage. Then it became two cups but only if before 12:00, then 13:00, then 14:00...

Now I drink however many, whenever.

And all the symptoms are back. Insomnia, tension, stress, anxiety, crashes...

So I wanted to ask people here: How many times did you fail and restart? Because this has happened before too. That one lasted about 3 weeks. I thought this time it was for good, but apparently wasn't.

The most significant thing I find hard to deal with are the mornings. Specifically, I don't know what to do when I wake up if I am not drinking some hot coffee. I don't know what to replace it with. I need to replace it because mornings feel so ""empty"" without coffee.

Anyway, just thought I'd ask here, cause many of the posts here had helped me keep going while I was off it. I'm just wondering if this has happened to people who successfully quit.

They went exceptionally well. First round was a simple leetcode medium that I had solved before followed by a ""choose your own design"" round. I received positive feedback after it was over, and went to the final rounds. The final rounds went even better. One high level design round where I had to design a a scalable object store, and a coding round where I was asked a leetcode hard (Regular Expression Matching). I was able to flesh out a good design AND I solved the coding problem without \*any\* hints. At the end of the design round, the interviewer even said ""This was really fun"". At the end, I also had a coffee chat with the team lead. After all of this, they rejected me saying it was an ""extremely tough decision"". 

This is not my first rejection and I've been preparing for a long time now.

1kxmfok,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kxmfok/abyssal_829/,Abyssal 829,"“829, you copy?” The voice crackled through the speakers on the console in front of me, pulling me back from the drowsy lethargy that I’d been enjoying for the last hour. I reluctantly sat up in my chair and dropped my feet from where they’d been resting atop the workstation to the dirty metallic floor with a hollow thud. It’d been a long night; I hadn’t slept very well, and when my alarm woke me this morning, I felt as if I hadn’t slept at all.

That damned wind. It seemed like it never stopped, but last night had been exceptionally noisome after night fell, howling and whistling across the exterior of the station, like it was searching for a way in. If I used my imagination just a little, it almost sounded like a hundred fingernails scratching at the hatch.

I tried not to use my imagination too much.

It wasn’t much better this morning. It sounded like a hell of a blow out there, but that was to be expected this time of year, I suppose.

“Abyssal 829, this is Central – respond. *Crawford, pick up if you’re there*,” the voice hailed again, this time with the distinct coloring of urgency. It was slightly distorted, sounding strangely artificial mixed in with all that static.

I took a sip of my lukewarm coffee with a grimace and switched on the microphone.

“Yeah, this is Crawford. That you, Wilks?” I asked, as if it could have been anyone else out here in this frozen wasteland.

When Wilks replied, I heard the unmistakable tinge of relief in his tone. “Jesus, Mike, I’ve been hailing you for ten minutes. Where the hell have you been?”

*Ten minutes? I hadn’t heard a thing*. Maybe I’d dozed off after all, I thought, resolving to lay off the whiskey for a while.

“Yeah, sorry, Jack – I was in the head,” I lied. “What’s up?”

“515 went offline this morning at around 05:40,” he said. “Last transmission was at their oh-two-hundred scheduled check-in. Nothing since then. They’ve missed two check-ins since then.”

Now I sat up straight in my chair, the last vestiges of sleepiness dissolving in an instant. I punched a few keys on the console, bringing up my OpStat displays. “*Offline?* Are you sure? Storm’s pretty bad out here on the south rim; I’m getting a lot of distortion from your end. Maybe there’s just too much interference.”

Jack Wilks paused a moment before speaking again. “Corporate radioed me a little while ago. Their telemetry for 515 was reading some low-level seismic activity for forty-three minutes before all feeds went dead. Last status update from the station officer was, and I quote, ‘confused and agitated’.”

“Geller? She’s as strait-laced as they come,” I said with a frown. “I’ve never heard anybody describe her as confused *or* agitated.”

“I know,” Wilks said. “That’s what worries me. Especially with what happened last month.”

He didn’t need to elaborate; the memory of what happened to Abyssal 524 was still fresh in all our minds.

“That was an anomaly,” I said, echoing the official corporate findings. “Geological surveys were rushed and incomplete when 524 was deployed.” I tried to sound as resolute as I could, but Jack knew me better than that. It was more for my benefit than his.

“I know,” he relented, though I knew he didn’t believe it any more than I did. “But still, it makes me uneasy. Geller’s tough – as tough as they come. Hell, she’s been on station for what, sixteen months, all by herself?”

“Something like that, yeah,” I replied. My fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating the status screens until I found the one I was looking for – a listing of all the rim monitoring stations. My eyes scanned the list of amber text as I paged through the screens. I stopped when I found it – Abyssal 515. It stood out on the page like a beacon. Unlike the other station listings on the screen, the status metrics for 515 were empty, just dashes where the abbreviations and numeric values should have been.

“*Shit,*” I said under my breath, my mind already sifting through possible explanations that *weren’t* worst-case.

I didn’t come up with too many of them.

“So, what’s the plan?” I asked, though I had a sick feeling in my gut that I already knew what it was.

“We need to check it out and see if Geller’s okay,” he said carefully. “It might just be a communication disruption, like you said, but we need to make sure.”

I knew where this was heading, and I was already shaking my head. “No way, Jack. Uh-uh. There’s no way I’m going out there in this weather. One good gust will blow the mule right over the edge and I’m not getting paid enough for that. Rescue operations are not part of my contracted responsibilities.”

“Mike, listen – it’s not about the company or the monitoring station. If Geller’s hurt, we can’t just leave her out there. She could need help.”

“So, send someone else,” I argued. “Hell, send a response team or check it out yourself – I don’t care. I’m a monitoring tech, not a rescue operator.”

Wilks paused a moment before he spoke again. “The nearest response team has already been mobilized, but they’re hours away. I’m even farther, you know that. Mike, I can’t compel you to go check it out, but if Geller’s hurt or in need of help, you might be the only chance she has. What if it was you out there?”

I pushed myself away from the console and stood, running a hand through my scruffy hair and pacing anxiously, thoughts spinning. Wilks had fallen silent – he knew that there was nothing else he could say to convince me, but he also knew he’d already set the hook. If something *had* happened to the monitoring station, it was likely already too late for Geller. But if she *was* still there, she would need help, and soon. If nothing else, she would need an evac, and 829 – *my* shack – was the nearest option. I wondered how long a person could last outside in this weather, especially if they didn’t have shelter.

I heard Wilks’ words again in my head and I wondered what it would feel like if it were me.

Alone, in the dark. Huddling in the cold and the wind.

Listening to those sounds all around me. Maybe seeing dim shadows in the blinding mist.

 Just waiting for someone – *anyone* – to come for me.

*Damn it.*

“You’re an asshole, Jack,” I said finally.

“I know, Mike. I’m sorry,” was all he said.

“I’ll contact you when I have something to report.”

“Thanks, Mike. I’ll be standing by. Central out.”

\*

Fifteen minutes later, I was bundled in my foul weather gear – heavy coat and pants striped with reflective material, with thick gloves and boots. A pair of weather-worn goggles hung around my neck as I buckled myself into the enclosed cabin of my mule. The thing looked like one of those industrial snow cats, with rusted caterpillar tracks and a rotating emergency beacon on the roof. The yellow paint was faded and chipped, and the windscreen was scratched and in desperate need of replacement. Only one of the wipers still remained, and it barely worked well enough to leave grimy streaks across the glass.

I could hear the raging wind thrashing against the exterior of the heavy steel roll-up door, but it sounded subdued, removed from where I sat. The garage was large enough to accommodate two mules parked abreast, with room to spare, but it felt claustrophobic inside the cab.

“*What the hell are you doing, Mike*?” I asked myself for probably the hundredth time as I pressed the ignition switch. The powerful engine lurched to life with an angry roar, reverberating against the cold steel of the walls. The vibrations shook the gear shifter with a rattle as I worked my way across the illuminated control panel, turning on the various systems. Interior heat, air filters, comms, exterior lighting, navigation – I activated each of the subsystems in turn, verifying their statuses on the main display. When I was satisfied that all was working as expected, I took a deep breath and keyed in the command to raise the heavy roll-up door.

A red strobe near the door began to flash, joined by a muted warning alarm, and then the door lurched into motion, rising from the concrete floor with a squeal of protest. The gray light of day washed in as it rose, and I felt the raging of the wind as it swirled into the garage area, buffeting the mule as it came.

I lifted the headset from its hook and placed it over my ears, adjusting the boom mic in front of my mouth.

“Central, this is Abyssal 829 for radio check, how copy?” I said.

Wilks replied immediately. “829, this is Central. Read you five-by-five.”

“I’m heading out now, Jack. I’ll stay in contact and I’ll advise as soon as I have anything.”

And with that, I engaged the gear lever and throttled up, easing the mule forward, out of the shelter of the station and into the fury of the storm.

The monitoring stations were all connected by a paved roadway marked with bright yellow strobe lights to guide our way. The low, dense cloud cover overhead and the chaotic winds did their best to make it damned near impossible to see more than twenty feet, and that was only because of the efforts of the high-intensity exterior lights of the mule.

Within a minute, I glanced over my shoulder to find that my station had been swallowed up by the dim light and charcoal-colored dust. The muted white exterior lights were only just barely visible and fading quickly as I went.

All around me on either side of the road, the terrain was rocky and uneven – foreign, almost alien. Though it was barely past noon, the daylight was so subdued that it might as well have been late dusk. I pushed along, watching the rock formations pass by on either side. They seemed closer, somehow, as if the road had narrowed, dragging the terrain with it as it collapsed inward.

How long had it been since I’d been out here? A month, at least. Probably closer to two. That had been late summer, though, and the storms hadn’t really started yet.

On my right, what seemed like an endless hellscape of jagged rocky outcroppings and uneven, upturned ground stretched out beyond sight.

But it was to my left that I kept my eyes strained and focused. *It* was there; close but still hidden by the dust and the wind. That made it all the more unsettling, I thought – not being able to see it, but knowing it was there.

I straightened my course, having unconsciously drifted to the right side of the roadway, as if my hands were trying to keep me as far away as possible.

The wind rocked the mule on its tracks and strained at the doors, trying to pry them open to get inside. At one point, I thought I felt the steel treads scrape and slide across the gritty pavement as the heavy vehicle fought against a sudden gust, but that was probably just my imagination.

As unnerving as it was being away from the station in the storm, my rational mind knew there wasn’t really any chance of being blown over. The winds were strong, to be sure, and I wouldn’t want to be walking around outside, but the mule was twelve thousand pounds – six tons of anchor – with a massively overpowered engine driving the tracks. Outside was hell, but I was safe enough in here.

From the storm, at least.

I had traveled a mile, perhaps two, when I reached a spot where a sheer vertical wall of rockface rose a hundred feet in the air to the right of the roadway. It served as a windbreak, providing a temporary respite from the worst of the gale.

It also allowed the first view of the rim, only fifty feet away. I throttled back, bringing the mule to a halt in the shelter of the cliffside, and my eyes swept out over the vast empty space we knew simply as *the pit*.

It was twenty miles across, a ragged circular shaft punched into the solid rock of the ground. The walls of the pit were brutal and abrupt, as if the thing had been formed by some unimaginably massive bore.

We had no idea how deep it was, or if it even had a bottom, despite how insane that may sound. Nothing sent down into those depths ever returned. Manned vehicles, remote drones, even tethered cameras and sensors – they all just vanished without a trace, without warning. Even radar pulses and laser measuring devices were left blind by that immense black void.

No idea how it had come to be, or why. There was so much we didn’t know about it.

All we knew for sure was that thirty-seven years ago, in the middle of an active winter storm season, the lonely weather outpost that had been operating out here in this wasteland had gone silent. No alerts, no distress calls.

Nothing.

A month later, when the weather subsided enough to allow teams to investigate what had happened, all they found was the pit, a stygian maw larger than anyone could have imagined.

A doorway to hell, maybe.

Monitoring stations were built around its rim, to observe and document anything they could. Still, we knew little more about it now than we did all those years ago.

And everything we did know was bad.

I tore my eyes away from the swirling clouds of dust and mist that seemed ever-present as they rolled over the edges of the rim, hiding whatever lay below.

With a quiet curse, I put the mule back in gear and continued my travel. I was close to 515 now – not more than a few hundred yards, I estimated. The navigation screen jumped and changed, sometimes showing me right on top of the station, and at other times miles away yet. It might have been disconcerting if not for the fact that this was yet another of the occasional anomalies that surrounded the pit – the effect it had on radio and electromagnetic signals.

That’s one of the reasons I hadn’t been too concerned about radio communication loss with 515 initially. It wasn’t uncommon and typically remedied itself within an hour or two.

Telemetry loss was something different, though.

Telemetry from each of the monitoring stations was transmitted in real time via fiber optic cables carefully buried beside the roadway in a massive ring around the pit. They weren’t as easily disrupted by whatever was going on in there. If the company had lost the telemetry stream, that implied something bad had happened.

I pushed the thoughts from my head as I drove the mule along, focusing on the roadway ahead and already feeling the beginnings of a tension headache working at the back of my skull.

Soon, I came to the offshoot of pavement that veered left of the roadway and served as the approach to Abyssal 515. I released the breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding as the mule pushed stubbornly through the dust and damp mist. The wind had dropped significantly for the moment, and the air was almost still now.

That happened sometimes during these storms – the calm could last a minute or even an hour before the winds returned suddenly and without warning. God help the person caught in the open when that happened.

I was so focused on trying to pierce the veil of grimy fog that I almost didn’t notice that the paved drive ahead of me suddenly dropped away into the gaping abyss of the pit. I slammed both feet on the brake and the heavy vehicle rocked to a sudden halt, throwing me against the safety harness painfully.

I could almost imagine the ground beneath the mule’s treads beginning to give way.

“*Shit shit shit*,” I cursed, throwing the gearbox into reverse and carefully backing away from the edge. I’d come within feet of driving right over the rim and into whatever terrible oblivion lay below. Even with their grip on the controls, my hands were shaking as adrenalin flooded my senses and narrowed my vision.

When I’d backed away to a safe distance, I set the brake and took the mule out of gear, willing my hammering heartrate to slow and hoarse breathing to calm. I felt lightheaded, but that soon passed.

I repositioned the microphone in front of my lips. “Central, this is Abyssal 829. How copy?”

Nothing but static answered my hail. The suffocating feeling of remoteness and solitude crowded my thoughts, and I pushed them away as best I could.

I tried hailing Jack again with no better luck. The damned storm was blocking me. Isolating me from everything else.

I knew I needed to investigate further. I’d come this far, after all. I couldn’t leave without at least confirming my fears.

I waited a few seconds for the feeling of panic to subside, and I was able to unbuckle my harness. I removed the radio headset and positioned the goggles over my eyes to protect them from the scouring effect of the windblown dust and grit. We’d learned from those who came here before us; we knew it could blind a man in seconds.

Raising the filtered gaiter to cover the rest of my face, I unlatched and pushed the door of the mule open, stepping out onto the exposed steel tracks and then carefully climbing down to the rock-strewn ground.

The air out here was frigid – colder than it should have been, but my gear protected me. Even so, the icy air found even the most miniscule of gaps in my clothing and penetrated to my bare skin beneath, drawing from me a shudder and raising gooseflesh across my body.

I hated it out here.

Arming myself with a high-intensity torch from the cab of the mule, I carefully made my way across the paved drive, keeping the brilliant white beam scanning the gray and black terrain ahead of me.

Strange sounds surrounded the pit – it was one of the things I found the most unsettling about being out here. Deep and almost ethereal, like the whale-song of some displaced and cosmic leviathan, it rolled through the air, vibrating the ground beneath my boots. It wasn’t loud enough to be uncomfortable, but there was no denying the psychological effect it had on a person out here all alone.

Most deployments out here were only two-month stints; that’s about what the average person could handle before they started having…*issues*. Some others, like me, were able to stay longer. I’d been here for eight months so far and wasn’t planning to rotate out for another thirty-eight days.

Macy Geller was different, though. With four years in the marines and more than sixteen months on-station here, she was a goddamned legend. I had no idea how she’d persisted for so long, but I knew one thing for sure – Macy Geller was going to retire a very young and very rich woman.

At least, that was my sincere hope.

I made my way cautiously along the edge of the rim, making sure to keep as safe a distance as my search would allow. The rock that abutted the edge hadn’t crumbled away or eroded – the terminus was smooth and knife-sharp where it dropped away.

Pushing on a bit farther, I came upon what I had been dreading since I arrived – the steel and concrete foundation of the monitoring station itself. Of the building, there was no sign – it was simply gone, replaced by that menacing and unending nothingness that it had bordered. The foundation was twisted and torn, as if it had been riven by some great claw. Bundles of sheared wires hung exposed and swaying over the edge, and the fine white hair of fiber optic cables lay snaked out from their junction box nearby.

“*Holy shit*,” I muttered, staggering back a few steps from the devastation. What had happened to 515? What could have done this?

I was finished here. I needed to get back to the mule and back to my station. I needed to report what I’d found. Maybe I’d even request an early extraction. I’d done my time – let them find someone else to keep watch over this fucking hole.

As I turned, my boot found an unseen rut that cut across the rocky ground and I nearly fell before catching myself. I realized that I was looking at the distinct tracks made by another mule, leading away from where the station had stood.

Maybe she’d managed to get away, after all…

“*Macy! Macy Geller!*” I shouted as loud as I could, swinging my flashlight beam across the whole area. Once again, the lack of visibility was frustrating, making my search a nearly impossible task. She couldn’t have gone far, especially in the direction the tracks led. There was nothing but broken and rocky terrain that way, with boulders the size of houses crowding the landscape.

“*Geller! It’s Mike Crawford from 829! If you can hear me, call out!*” I shouted, my voice sounding pitifully small out here.

When I found Geller’s mule, it emerged from the mist like a wounded animal, its nose driven disastrously into the sheer edge of a rocky shelf twenty feet high. Even from here, I could tell it probably wouldn’t ever move again from where it now rested.

I rushed to the cab, painfully aware that the wind was starting to pick back up again. I was just thankful that it was giving me some uncharacteristic warning instead of simply springing up and blowing me over the rim and into the pit.

The blunt nose of the mule had taken the worst of the impact, and even though it hadn’t been moving with any great speed when it found the rockface, twelve thousand pounds of steel in motion wasn’t inclined to stop on a dime.

I twisted the handle and pulled on the hatch, but the twisted and bent frame held it fast. I could see a form inside, in the driver’s seat, but the glass had been frosted over by the windblown grit and was nearly opaque, so I couldn’t make out any details. I didn’t miss the lack of movement, though.

Still, there was a chance now.

With renewed urgency, I rushed around to the rear of the mule, to where I knew the equipment storage was. Inside the weather-beaten compartment, I found the wrecking bar I was looking for – a heavy pry-bar with a pointed tip on one end and a thick flattened wedge on the other.

I came back around to the hatch and slammed the wedge into the gap between the door and the frame. The bar found purchase and I heaved against it with all my weight.

The metal groaned and fought, but then the door released with a screech and burst open so abruptly that I nearly fell on my ass.

I dropped the heavy bar to the ground with a ringing clatter and scrambled up onto the steel tracks of the mule, leaning into the cab. The nightmare I found there caused me to lurch backward, almost off the edge of the tracks.

Geller, the woman I’d known mostly through radio contact and whom I’d only met face-to-face on a few occasions, was still harnessed into her seat. Her heavy jacket had been thrown on in a hurry and wasn’t even zipped. Her goggles still sat securely over her eyes, but everything beyond that was a mess.

It took me longer than it should have to process exactly what I was seeing, and when I did, I still couldn’t make sense of it.

Drying, sticky blood covered everything in a tacky coating. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream that spoke of the terror that must have filled her final moments. Her skin was gray and splotchy, with what looked like open sores all over, weeping thick fluid and giving her the obscene appearance that the flesh was melting away from her skull.

I looked away from her face and saw her hands still wrapped around the controls, even in death. For a moment I wondered why they hadn’t released their grip. When I looked closer, I saw that they weren’t really *clutching* the hard plastic at all, but had somehow become adhered to it, sinking obscenely into the surface and… melding with it.

The veins of her exposed skin stood out in stark contrast, snaking just below the surface like black tendrils, spiderwebbing beneath her thin gray flesh. I forced myself to reach for her goggles and found them fused to her face. Looking through the scratched lenses instead, I found myself staring at two milky-white orbs, wide and filled with horror, but thankfully still and lifeless.

I’m not sure what I would have done if they’d blinked just then.

A sudden howl of wind rose as it wound through the rock and over the rim of the pit behind me. That was enough to draw my attention and spur me to motion.

I had to leave, and *now*. I couldn’t be caught outside my mule when the storm returned in earnest, or I might be blown right over the edge – just another soul lost to the darkness.

I’m still not sure why the storm had paused its fury long enough for me to complete my search; perhaps it *wanted* me to find Geller, to show me what it had done to her.

Maybe it wanted to show me what it was going to do to me.

I raced back to the safety of my mule, the engine still idling as I’d left it. Hurriedly securing myself in the cab, I turned it around and rushed back to my station, pushing the throttles farther than I should have. The aging engine protested and the black roadway passed beneath me in a blur as I returned to the only haven I knew – Abyssal 829.

Miraculously, fifteen minutes later, the dim exterior lights of my station appeared before me, emerging from the wind-driven detritus of grimy and damp grit like a lighthouse of old. I slowed as it came fully into view and keyed the exterior door of the garage as soon as I was close enough.

The hellish storm had returned with all its fury now, and I could even see the muted flashes of distant lightning from somewhere over the pit.

That was new.

As soon as I had the mule inside and the door closed securely behind it, I quickly shut it down and leapt from the cab, rushing into the station and to my control room. I shed off the heavy jacket, letting it fall to the floor as I reached for the communication controls. I had to let Jack know what I’d seen – what had happened to Geller.

He’d know what to do; that was his job, after all. This was all above my pay grade.

But then my hand froze, hovering over the console as my eyes settled on the OpStat screen I’d been looking at before I left.

The list of monitoring stations was still waiting patiently for my return, but something was wrong. I felt my mouth go dry as I saw their telemetry feeds begin to go offline, one by one, blinking out like candles being snuffed.

Outside, the wind howled, and I heard that haunting moan sweep over the station, louder than ever before – maybe closer – and now sounding less like the ethereal whale song I’d always equated it to.

Now it sounded more menacing. Threatening.

I came across an interesting ask and thought it might be worth discussing here.

The goal: find a travel coffee cup or tumbler that *isn’t* insulated, has a traditional coffee lid (no straw), and fits in a car cupholder. It also needs to be safe for pouring hot coffee, but not designed to keep it hot for long—ideal for someone who prefers their coffee lukewarm. Bonus if it can be customized with a business logo (think Etsy or similar options).

Has anyone found a cup like this? Any creative workarounds, custom solutions, or lesser-known brands worth checking out?

1kxme5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNightTales/comments/1kxme5e/abyssal_829/,Abyssal 829,"“829, you copy?” The voice crackled through the speakers on the console in front of me, pulling me back from the drowsy lethargy that I’d been enjoying for the last hour. I reluctantly sat up in my chair and dropped my feet from where they’d been resting atop the workstation to the dirty metallic floor with a hollow thud. It’d been a long night; I hadn’t slept very well, and when my alarm woke me this morning, I felt as if I hadn’t slept at all.

That damned wind. It seemed like it never stopped, but last night had been exceptionally noisome after night fell, howling and whistling across the exterior of the station, like it was searching for a way in. If I used my imagination just a little, it almost sounded like a hundred fingernails scratching at the hatch.

I tried not to use my imagination too much.

It wasn’t much better this morning. It sounded like a hell of a blow out there, but that was to be expected this time of year, I suppose.

“Abyssal 829, this is Central – respond. *Crawford, pick up if you’re there*,” the voice hailed again, this time with the distinct coloring of urgency. It was slightly distorted, sounding strangely artificial mixed in with all that static.

I took a sip of my lukewarm coffee with a grimace and switched on the microphone.

“Yeah, this is Crawford. That you, Wilks?” I asked, as if it could have been anyone else out here in this frozen wasteland.

When Wilks replied, I heard the unmistakable tinge of relief in his tone. “Jesus, Mike, I’ve been hailing you for ten minutes. Where the hell have you been?”

*Ten minutes? I hadn’t heard a thing*. Maybe I’d dozed off after all, I thought, resolving to lay off the whiskey for a while.

“Yeah, sorry, Jack – I was in the head,” I lied. “What’s up?”

“515 went offline this morning at around 05:40,” he said. “Last transmission was at their oh-two-hundred scheduled check-in. Nothing since then. They’ve missed two check-ins since then.”

Now I sat up straight in my chair, the last vestiges of sleepiness dissolving in an instant. I punched a few keys on the console, bringing up my OpStat displays. “*Offline?* Are you sure? Storm’s pretty bad out here on the south rim; I’m getting a lot of distortion from your end. Maybe there’s just too much interference.”

Jack Wilks paused a moment before speaking again. “Corporate radioed me a little while ago. Their telemetry for 515 was reading some low-level seismic activity for forty-three minutes before all feeds went dead. Last status update from the station officer was, and I quote, ‘confused and agitated’.”

“Geller? She’s as strait-laced as they come,” I said with a frown. “I’ve never heard anybody describe her as confused *or* agitated.”

“I know,” Wilks said. “That’s what worries me. Especially with what happened last month.”

He didn’t need to elaborate; the memory of what happened to Abyssal 524 was still fresh in all our minds.

“That was an anomaly,” I said, echoing the official corporate findings. “Geological surveys were rushed and incomplete when 524 was deployed.” I tried to sound as resolute as I could, but Jack knew me better than that. It was more for my benefit than his.

“I know,” he relented, though I knew he didn’t believe it any more than I did. “But still, it makes me uneasy. Geller’s tough – as tough as they come. Hell, she’s been on station for what, sixteen months, all by herself?”

“Something like that, yeah,” I replied. My fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating the status screens until I found the one I was looking for – a listing of all the rim monitoring stations. My eyes scanned the list of amber text as I paged through the screens. I stopped when I found it – Abyssal 515. It stood out on the page like a beacon. Unlike the other station listings on the screen, the status metrics for 515 were empty, just dashes where the abbreviations and numeric values should have been.

“*Shit,*” I said under my breath, my mind already sifting through possible explanations that *weren’t* worst-case.

I didn’t come up with too many of them.

“So, what’s the plan?” I asked, though I had a sick feeling in my gut that I already knew what it was.

“We need to check it out and see if Geller’s okay,” he said carefully. “It might just be a communication disruption, like you said, but we need to make sure.”

I knew where this was heading, and I was already shaking my head. “No way, Jack. Uh-uh. There’s no way I’m going out there in this weather. One good gust will blow the mule right over the edge and I’m not getting paid enough for that. Rescue operations are not part of my contracted responsibilities.”

“Mike, listen – it’s not about the company or the monitoring station. If Geller’s hurt, we can’t just leave her out there. She could need help.”

“So, send someone else,” I argued. “Hell, send a response team or check it out yourself – I don’t care. I’m a monitoring tech, not a rescue operator.”

Wilks paused a moment before he spoke again. “The nearest response team has already been mobilized, but they’re hours away. I’m even farther, you know that. Mike, I can’t compel you to go check it out, but if Geller’s hurt or in need of help, you might be the only chance she has. What if it was you out there?”

I pushed myself away from the console and stood, running a hand through my scruffy hair and pacing anxiously, thoughts spinning. Wilks had fallen silent – he knew that there was nothing else he could say to convince me, but he also knew he’d already set the hook. If something *had* happened to the monitoring station, it was likely already too late for Geller. But if she *was* still there, she would need help, and soon. If nothing else, she would need an evac, and 829 – *my* shack – was the nearest option. I wondered how long a person could last outside in this weather, especially if they didn’t have shelter.

I heard Wilks’ words again in my head and I wondered what it would feel like if it were me.

Alone, in the dark. Huddling in the cold and the wind.

Listening to those sounds all around me. Maybe seeing dim shadows in the blinding mist.

 Just waiting for someone – *anyone* – to come for me.

*Damn it.*

“You’re an asshole, Jack,” I said finally.

“I know, Mike. I’m sorry,” was all he said.

“I’ll contact you when I have something to report.”

“Thanks, Mike. I’ll be standing by. Central out.”

\*

Fifteen minutes later, I was bundled in my foul weather gear – heavy coat and pants striped with reflective material, with thick gloves and boots. A pair of weather-worn goggles hung around my neck as I buckled myself into the enclosed cabin of my mule. The thing looked like one of those industrial snow cats, with rusted caterpillar tracks and a rotating emergency beacon on the roof. The yellow paint was faded and chipped, and the windscreen was scratched and in desperate need of replacement. Only one of the wipers still remained, and it barely worked well enough to leave grimy streaks across the glass.

I could hear the raging wind thrashing against the exterior of the heavy steel roll-up door, but it sounded subdued, removed from where I sat. The garage was large enough to accommodate two mules parked abreast, with room to spare, but it felt claustrophobic inside the cab.

“*What the hell are you doing, Mike*?” I asked myself for probably the hundredth time as I pressed the ignition switch. The powerful engine lurched to life with an angry roar, reverberating against the cold steel of the walls. The vibrations shook the gear shifter with a rattle as I worked my way across the illuminated control panel, turning on the various systems. Interior heat, air filters, comms, exterior lighting, navigation – I activated each of the subsystems in turn, verifying their statuses on the main display. When I was satisfied that all was working as expected, I took a deep breath and keyed in the command to raise the heavy roll-up door.

A red strobe near the door began to flash, joined by a muted warning alarm, and then the door lurched into motion, rising from the concrete floor with a squeal of protest. The gray light of day washed in as it rose, and I felt the raging of the wind as it swirled into the garage area, buffeting the mule as it came.

I lifted the headset from its hook and placed it over my ears, adjusting the boom mic in front of my mouth.

“Central, this is Abyssal 829 for radio check, how copy?” I said.

Wilks replied immediately. “829, this is Central. Read you five-by-five.”

“I’m heading out now, Jack. I’ll stay in contact and I’ll advise as soon as I have anything.”

And with that, I engaged the gear lever and throttled up, easing the mule forward, out of the shelter of the station and into the fury of the storm.

The monitoring stations were all connected by a paved roadway marked with bright yellow strobe lights to guide our way. The low, dense cloud cover overhead and the chaotic winds did their best to make it damned near impossible to see more than twenty feet, and that was only because of the efforts of the high-intensity exterior lights of the mule.

Within a minute, I glanced over my shoulder to find that my station had been swallowed up by the dim light and charcoal-colored dust. The muted white exterior lights were only just barely visible and fading quickly as I went.

All around me on either side of the road, the terrain was rocky and uneven – foreign, almost alien. Though it was barely past noon, the daylight was so subdued that it might as well have been late dusk. I pushed along, watching the rock formations pass by on either side. They seemed closer, somehow, as if the road had narrowed, dragging the terrain with it as it collapsed inward.

How long had it been since I’d been out here? A month, at least. Probably closer to two. That had been late summer, though, and the storms hadn’t really started yet.

On my right, what seemed like an endless hellscape of jagged rocky outcroppings and uneven, upturned ground stretched out beyond sight.

But it was to my left that I kept my eyes strained and focused. *It* was there; close but still hidden by the dust and the wind. That made it all the more unsettling, I thought – not being able to see it, but knowing it was there.

I straightened my course, having unconsciously drifted to the right side of the roadway, as if my hands were trying to keep me as far away as possible.

The wind rocked the mule on its tracks and strained at the doors, trying to pry them open to get inside. At one point, I thought I felt the steel treads scrape and slide across the gritty pavement as the heavy vehicle fought against a sudden gust, but that was probably just my imagination.

As unnerving as it was being away from the station in the storm, my rational mind knew there wasn’t really any chance of being blown over. The winds were strong, to be sure, and I wouldn’t want to be walking around outside, but the mule was twelve thousand pounds – six tons of anchor – with a massively overpowered engine driving the tracks. Outside was hell, but I was safe enough in here.

From the storm, at least.

I had traveled a mile, perhaps two, when I reached a spot where a sheer vertical wall of rockface rose a hundred feet in the air to the right of the roadway. It served as a windbreak, providing a temporary respite from the worst of the gale.

It also allowed the first view of the rim, only fifty feet away. I throttled back, bringing the mule to a halt in the shelter of the cliffside, and my eyes swept out over the vast empty space we knew simply as *the pit*.

It was twenty miles across, a ragged circular shaft punched into the solid rock of the ground. The walls of the pit were brutal and abrupt, as if the thing had been formed by some unimaginably massive bore.

We had no idea how deep it was, or if it even had a bottom, despite how insane that may sound. Nothing sent down into those depths ever returned. Manned vehicles, remote drones, even tethered cameras and sensors – they all just vanished without a trace, without warning. Even radar pulses and laser measuring devices were left blind by that immense black void.

No idea how it had come to be, or why. There was so much we didn’t know about it.

All we knew for sure was that thirty-seven years ago, in the middle of an active winter storm season, the lonely weather outpost that had been operating out here in this wasteland had gone silent. No alerts, no distress calls.

Nothing.

A month later, when the weather subsided enough to allow teams to investigate what had happened, all they found was the pit, a stygian maw larger than anyone could have imagined.

A doorway to hell, maybe.

Monitoring stations were built around its rim, to observe and document anything they could. Still, we knew little more about it now than we did all those years ago.

And everything we did know was bad.

I tore my eyes away from the swirling clouds of dust and mist that seemed ever-present as they rolled over the edges of the rim, hiding whatever lay below.

With a quiet curse, I put the mule back in gear and continued my travel. I was close to 515 now – not more than a few hundred yards, I estimated. The navigation screen jumped and changed, sometimes showing me right on top of the station, and at other times miles away yet. It might have been disconcerting if not for the fact that this was yet another of the occasional anomalies that surrounded the pit – the effect it had on radio and electromagnetic signals.

That’s one of the reasons I hadn’t been too concerned about radio communication loss with 515 initially. It wasn’t uncommon and typically remedied itself within an hour or two.

Telemetry loss was something different, though.

Telemetry from each of the monitoring stations was transmitted in real time via fiber optic cables carefully buried beside the roadway in a massive ring around the pit. They weren’t as easily disrupted by whatever was going on in there. If the company had lost the telemetry stream, that implied something bad had happened.

I pushed the thoughts from my head as I drove the mule along, focusing on the roadway ahead and already feeling the beginnings of a tension headache working at the back of my skull.

Soon, I came to the offshoot of pavement that veered left of the roadway and served as the approach to Abyssal 515. I released the breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding as the mule pushed stubbornly through the dust and damp mist. The wind had dropped significantly for the moment, and the air was almost still now.

That happened sometimes during these storms – the calm could last a minute or even an hour before the winds returned suddenly and without warning. God help the person caught in the open when that happened.

I was so focused on trying to pierce the veil of grimy fog that I almost didn’t notice that the paved drive ahead of me suddenly dropped away into the gaping abyss of the pit. I slammed both feet on the brake and the heavy vehicle rocked to a sudden halt, throwing me against the safety harness painfully.

I could almost imagine the ground beneath the mule’s treads beginning to give way.

“*Shit shit shit*,” I cursed, throwing the gearbox into reverse and carefully backing away from the edge. I’d come within feet of driving right over the rim and into whatever terrible oblivion lay below. Even with their grip on the controls, my hands were shaking as adrenalin flooded my senses and narrowed my vision.

When I’d backed away to a safe distance, I set the brake and took the mule out of gear, willing my hammering heartrate to slow and hoarse breathing to calm. I felt lightheaded, but that soon passed.

I repositioned the microphone in front of my lips. “Central, this is Abyssal 829. How copy?”

Nothing but static answered my hail. The suffocating feeling of remoteness and solitude crowded my thoughts, and I pushed them away as best I could.

I tried hailing Jack again with no better luck. The damned storm was blocking me. Isolating me from everything else.

I knew I needed to investigate further. I’d come this far, after all. I couldn’t leave without at least confirming my fears.

I waited a few seconds for the feeling of panic to subside, and I was able to unbuckle my harness. I removed the radio headset and positioned the goggles over my eyes to protect them from the scouring effect of the windblown dust and grit. We’d learned from those who came here before us; we knew it could blind a man in seconds.

Raising the filtered gaiter to cover the rest of my face, I unlatched and pushed the door of the mule open, stepping out onto the exposed steel tracks and then carefully climbing down to the rock-strewn ground.

The air out here was frigid – colder than it should have been, but my gear protected me. Even so, the icy air found even the most miniscule of gaps in my clothing and penetrated to my bare skin beneath, drawing from me a shudder and raising gooseflesh across my body.

I hated it out here.

Arming myself with a high-intensity torch from the cab of the mule, I carefully made my way across the paved drive, keeping the brilliant white beam scanning the gray and black terrain ahead of me.

Strange sounds surrounded the pit – it was one of the things I found the most unsettling about being out here. Deep and almost ethereal, like the whale-song of some displaced and cosmic leviathan, it rolled through the air, vibrating the ground beneath my boots. It wasn’t loud enough to be uncomfortable, but there was no denying the psychological effect it had on a person out here all alone.

Most deployments out here were only two-month stints; that’s about what the average person could handle before they started having…*issues*. Some others, like me, were able to stay longer. I’d been here for eight months so far and wasn’t planning to rotate out for another thirty-eight days.

Macy Geller was different, though. With four years in the marines and more than sixteen months on-station here, she was a goddamned legend. I had no idea how she’d persisted for so long, but I knew one thing for sure – Macy Geller was going to retire a very young and very rich woman.

At least, that was my sincere hope.

I made my way cautiously along the edge of the rim, making sure to keep as safe a distance as my search would allow. The rock that abutted the edge hadn’t crumbled away or eroded – the terminus was smooth and knife-sharp where it dropped away.

Pushing on a bit farther, I came upon what I had been dreading since I arrived – the steel and concrete foundation of the monitoring station itself. Of the building, there was no sign – it was simply gone, replaced by that menacing and unending nothingness that it had bordered. The foundation was twisted and torn, as if it had been riven by some great claw. Bundles of sheared wires hung exposed and swaying over the edge, and the fine white hair of fiber optic cables lay snaked out from their junction box nearby.

“*Holy shit*,” I muttered, staggering back a few steps from the devastation. What had happened to 515? What could have done this?

I was finished here. I needed to get back to the mule and back to my station. I needed to report what I’d found. Maybe I’d even request an early extraction. I’d done my time – let them find someone else to keep watch over this fucking hole.

As I turned, my boot found an unseen rut that cut across the rocky ground and I nearly fell before catching myself. I realized that I was looking at the distinct tracks made by another mule, leading away from where the station had stood.

Maybe she’d managed to get away, after all…

“*Macy! Macy Geller!*” I shouted as loud as I could, swinging my flashlight beam across the whole area. Once again, the lack of visibility was frustrating, making my search a nearly impossible task. She couldn’t have gone far, especially in the direction the tracks led. There was nothing but broken and rocky terrain that way, with boulders the size of houses crowding the landscape.

“*Geller! It’s Mike Crawford from 829! If you can hear me, call out!*” I shouted, my voice sounding pitifully small out here.

When I found Geller’s mule, it emerged from the mist like a wounded animal, its nose driven disastrously into the sheer edge of a rocky shelf twenty feet high. Even from here, I could tell it probably wouldn’t ever move again from where it now rested.

I rushed to the cab, painfully aware that the wind was starting to pick back up again. I was just thankful that it was giving me some uncharacteristic warning instead of simply springing up and blowing me over the rim and into the pit.

The blunt nose of the mule had taken the worst of the impact, and even though it hadn’t been moving with any great speed when it found the rockface, twelve thousand pounds of steel in motion wasn’t inclined to stop on a dime.

I twisted the handle and pulled on the hatch, but the twisted and bent frame held it fast. I could see a form inside, in the driver’s seat, but the glass had been frosted over by the windblown grit and was nearly opaque, so I couldn’t make out any details. I didn’t miss the lack of movement, though.

Still, there was a chance now.

With renewed urgency, I rushed around to the rear of the mule, to where I knew the equipment storage was. Inside the weather-beaten compartment, I found the wrecking bar I was looking for – a heavy pry-bar with a pointed tip on one end and a thick flattened wedge on the other.

I came back around to the hatch and slammed the wedge into the gap between the door and the frame. The bar found purchase and I heaved against it with all my weight.

The metal groaned and fought, but then the door released with a screech and burst open so abruptly that I nearly fell on my ass.

I dropped the heavy bar to the ground with a ringing clatter and scrambled up onto the steel tracks of the mule, leaning into the cab. The nightmare I found there caused me to lurch backward, almost off the edge of the tracks.

Geller, the woman I’d known mostly through radio contact and whom I’d only met face-to-face on a few occasions, was still harnessed into her seat. Her heavy jacket had been thrown on in a hurry and wasn’t even zipped. Her goggles still sat securely over her eyes, but everything beyond that was a mess.

It took me longer than it should have to process exactly what I was seeing, and when I did, I still couldn’t make sense of it.

Drying, sticky blood covered everything in a tacky coating. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream that spoke of the terror that must have filled her final moments. Her skin was gray and splotchy, with what looked like open sores all over, weeping thick fluid and giving her the obscene appearance that the flesh was melting away from her skull.

I looked away from her face and saw her hands still wrapped around the controls, even in death. For a moment I wondered why they hadn’t released their grip. When I looked closer, I saw that they weren’t really *clutching* the hard plastic at all, but had somehow become adhered to it, sinking obscenely into the surface and… melding with it.

The veins of her exposed skin stood out in stark contrast, snaking just below the surface like black tendrils, spiderwebbing beneath her thin gray flesh. I forced myself to reach for her goggles and found them fused to her face. Looking through the scratched lenses instead, I found myself staring at two milky-white orbs, wide and filled with horror, but thankfully still and lifeless.

I’m not sure what I would have done if they’d blinked just then.

A sudden howl of wind rose as it wound through the rock and over the rim of the pit behind me. That was enough to draw my attention and spur me to motion.

I had to leave, and *now*. I couldn’t be caught outside my mule when the storm returned in earnest, or I might be blown right over the edge – just another soul lost to the darkness.

I’m still not sure why the storm had paused its fury long enough for me to complete my search; perhaps it *wanted* me to find Geller, to show me what it had done to her.

Maybe it wanted to show me what it was going to do to me.

I raced back to the safety of my mule, the engine still idling as I’d left it. Hurriedly securing myself in the cab, I turned it around and rushed back to my station, pushing the throttles farther than I should have. The aging engine protested and the black roadway passed beneath me in a blur as I returned to the only haven I knew – Abyssal 829.

Miraculously, fifteen minutes later, the dim exterior lights of my station appeared before me, emerging from the wind-driven detritus of grimy and damp grit like a lighthouse of old. I slowed as it came fully into view and keyed the exterior door of the garage as soon as I was close enough.

The hellish storm had returned with all its fury now, and I could even see the muted flashes of distant lightning from somewhere over the pit.

That was new.

As soon as I had the mule inside and the door closed securely behind it, I quickly shut it down and leapt from the cab, rushing into the station and to my control room. I shed off the heavy jacket, letting it fall to the floor as I reached for the communication controls. I had to let Jack know what I’d seen – what had happened to Geller.

He’d know what to do; that was his job, after all. This was all above my pay grade.

But then my hand froze, hovering over the console as my eyes settled on the OpStat screen I’d been looking at before I left.

The list of monitoring stations was still waiting patiently for my return, but something was wrong. I felt my mouth go dry as I saw their telemetry feeds begin to go offline, one by one, blinking out like candles being snuffed.

Outside, the wind howled, and I heard that haunting moan sweep over the station, louder than ever before – maybe closer – and now sounding less like the ethereal whale song I’d always equated it to.

Now it sounded more menacing. Threatening.

Trigger warnings ⚠️: Pregnancy-related stress, mention of abortion/miscarriage, suicide ideation, possible boundary violations

I’m (27) writing this because I honestly feel like I’m at the edge of my emotional rope, at my very wit's end, and I need outside perspectives. I’m not even sure if him (27) and I are still “in” a relationship right now —it’s all in a grey area to me— but we’ve been on and off for almost two years.

The reason it's a grey area right now is because two days ago he asked me to be girlfriend again and less than 24 hours after shit hit the fan because he insisted on wanting to talk to my dad, but when the time was there he was too anxious to do it. This has happened before. He initiates conversation with my father, insists that HE wants to talk to my old man about me, creates chaos by also wanting to bring his own father into things (without discussing anything with me by the way) and then backs out last minute. This second time my father actually got mad because he doesn't understand what he's on, wanting to talk to my father then to change his mind last minute because things aren't going his way.

Anyway, It’s been an intense ride from the very start. It’s been a rollercoaster full of emotions and feelings. And now, I’m also pregnant, and everything is crumbling under the weight of what I believe should be bringing softness and unity.

**To give some background**

I’ve been diagnosed with BPD around 4 years ago, when I was 23, and I’m very self-aware of it. I know my (unhealthy) patterns, I know my triggers, and I’ve worked hard to be mindful of how I respond to situations as best possible when intense emotions are triggered. Specialists I’ve seen since my diagnosis have told me that, for someone with BPD, my level of self-awareness is unusually high and I struggle to shift blame off myself, even when I was in the right. Two psychologists, who I've seen late December 2024 to early January 2025, have wondered if my symptoms were more due to untreated depression instead of BPD itself. My current psychiatrist, who has been treating me since January, is even considering rediagnosing me because he believes it's untreated depression that has affected me more than an actual personality disorder. Irregardless, I was never ashamed of having BPD. The diagnoses has, in fact, helped me learn about myself a lot over the past few years.

Moving on, I've been on antidepressants for six months now, too, and I have made a lot of progress. Friends and family all tell me that I'm calmer and softer than I was before, some even saying that I'm more myself again. I smile more, I'm less cynical, I am open to do more, I make decisions not based on emotions but out of a logical place now compared to before. I personally also feel more emotionally balanced now, and I believe I've grown so much, being able to actually *name* my emotions and take a step back before being reactive. I still struggle with being defensive and being offended on occasions, but I believe that's more a deep rooted personality trait that I am not proud of and am trying really hard to unlearn. This is a trait of that leads me to cut someone off or retract from a conversation, though I have been teaching myself to take a few steps back before I react based on these feelings. I'm not perfect, I never will be, but I do want to be better. Especially when it comes to communication.

But there’s one person who brings out a side of me, especially these traits that I'm trying to unlearn, I thought I had grown beyond and that’s my partner. I am not blaming him, my reactions and behavior are my responsibility, but I did notice a pattern, however.

Our relationship has been rocky, even unhealthy at times. We’ve broken up a few times before on his behalf. Fought countless of times, with small arguments escalating to really big ones that would easily drag out for two days despite me apologizing and owning up for my (rightful) reactions after emotionally overextending myself. Now I believe in intent vs. impact, but I also strongly believe in cause and effect — the latter usually being dismissed by the other party.

The love was there, and it still is, but it's constantly being undermined by how conflict is handled. Especially him. I’ve found that with him, I’m always walking on eggshells to prevent arguments to escalate, and even ***when*** I do it still manages to happen. Not because I don't know how to de-escalate, though I am guilty for not knowing when to shut up sometimes (I have the bad habit of ranting out loud when I am mad and feel unheard and wants me to shut up). But things usually also escalate because if I speak too openly about my emotions, I’ll trigger something in him that leads to him becoming anxious or saying that I'm going to trigger a panic attack. It usually leads to us having to focus on his anxiety (to prevent the panic attack) and it's caused because I didn't express myself kind or soft enough for his liking. Or I said something at a time that didn't work for him (e.g. he came from work and I would think out loud, even telling him that I don't need a reaction, but some light reassurance would be nice).

During arguments that I have 'caused' for the reasons mentioned above, he'll deflect and avoid responsibility, or turning everything back on me, by saying things like my body language not being right, or my tone triggering him, or my facial expressions making him feel uncomfortable. All of these can, if not will, trigger anxiety or a possible panic attack. If not handled right away or correctly he might have an emotional break down towards me and I'd be at fault for it because I didn't stop talking or I wasn't emotionally safe for him by consoling him in the moment. There have been many moments in which he used my words against me, too, taking my intentions and words the wrong way, which leads to me over-explaining myself as a way to prove that I didn't mean it the way he took it. Then I'd spend minutes, if not hours, trying to convince and reassure and convince him of my true intentions, re-tracking my words, apologizing and rephrasing myself until it's good enough for his liking and for him to believe.

And, no, I am not trying to put him on blast here. I am no angel either. During arguments I can be sharp, say (mean) things I don't mean and regret right after. There has been an incident where I threw my phone, not at him, but at the floor out of frustration. It ended up ALMOST hitting my glass coffee table. In many instances, though, while being so frustrated I would lock myself in the bathroom and hit myself. And last but not least: when angry, I raise my voice and talk over him. Though, many times it's because I was still talking and he cut me off or talked over me. I also have the tendency to completely shut down and shut him out emotionally when I am overwhelmed and trying to self regulate while trying to be there for him by remained emotionally available as best as I can. I have been checking myself on this behavior and am anything but proud of it.

**Fast forward to recently: I found out I was pregnant, a steady week after we broke up again about a month ago**

When I first found out I was pregnant, I got a call from my GP after the sac they had seen was mistaken for a fibroid. I will save you guys the boring details, but long story short is that I reached out to him after a week of no-contact. At first I was hesitant, but due to us having had an abortion in November 2024 that we both ended up regretting, I figured I'd tell him about this. So I did.

We called, after I told him the news over text since I didn't if or when I was going to hear from him, and he agreed to come over. At first he suggested we meet on neutral ground (which would be outside my place) but after hearing how upset and distressed I was, he agreed to coming over to mine. Thinking I was going to be met with some compassion or empathy, I was met with stoicism, apathy and indifference. I pushed through that, despite being as emotional as I was, and we spoke about the situation. That was the very first time ever that he threw my BPD in my face. He said that, since I was torn between keeping the baby or having another abortion, he wants me to have an abortion. His reasoning being that he has read and seen (with a family member of his) what it's like to have a child with someone with a personality disorder. That right there broke me in ways I have yet to recover from.

I told him that that was a hurtful thing to say, he didn't seem moved by it, and just kept talking about how having a child with me would possibly affect him. We somehow also started talking about things between us and he, while I was already feeling so fragile, went on to talk about how free and at peace he feels without me having been in his life for the past week. How great and amazing he was doing, finally being able to hang with friends without having to think about me. Without having to think about my feelings (lol), that he was now free to sexually explore himself and have the threesome he has always wanted (which he always condemned me for because I had one with two women when I was 18-19ish, which was years before I met him). Asking him how he felt about me, he said that he no longer had any feelings for me, no longer felt a connection with me, but I was also the best woman that has ever happened to him. That he would never ever meet a woman as good as me. That he meant it when he said that I was it/the one for him.

He ended up leaving about an hour later, leaving me all alone with these burdens, but something also clicked for me in that moment. All I could think was ''fuck this, I'll do it my damn self if I have to.'' He ended up calling me about 10 minutes after leaving my place to apologize for the things he said to me. I cut him off and told him ''thank you for helping me lose feelings and letting go off this connection.'' and I hung up on him. The next day I woke up to at least 18 missed calls, several text messages in which he apologized but also told me that if I wanted to keep the baby, he'd fully support me. Then I received a voice note in which he apologized to me as well for how he spoke to me the day prior. A second voice note followed in which he told he wants to step up and be there for his child if I keep the baby, that he wouldn't want to do this (raising a child, co-parenting) with anyone else but me. Praised me for how good of a mother I'd be and that he shouldn't have said what he said. I ignored his many calls for a while, needing some time still too, but I eventually texted him back saying that he can keep his apologies, that I don't want or need anything from him, that I got it, and for him to enjoy his freedom and that I hope he finds what he's looking for. He quickly deflected, telling me that none of this is about us but it's about the baby. That he's the father and that he has rights as well - which is completely true. I would never ever in my life try and sabotage or keep a child away from its father. That is unless the father is obviously unstable and unsafe, but I don't have a reason to do so, right?

Anyway, I told him ''May I decide to keep the baby, it will have a father.'' and he took that as me raising the child with another man. That's also how those, who he showed our text exchange to took it as. I told him that due to medical reasons I wasn't even sure yet if it was viable and I didn't know whether I wanted to keep it yet because, come on.. Look at us. He decided that he'd reach out to me in 2 weeks, I told him that I'd appreciate it if he would keep the pregnancy to himself and for him to leave me alone. He said he'll hope to hear from me when the time is right and that I keep him the loop. He then told me to never joke about ''the child will have father'', he is the father. To which I responded with ''it was never a joke because ain't nothing funny, anything else?'' He didn't text me back. I took it upon myself to count back the weeks to see how far along I was and from my calculations I was 5 weeks along. I told him this, but he never texted back.

**After nearly 3 weeks I reached out to him again**

I reached out to him through text with a light message, not wanting to come off the wrong way, asking him if he'd be open for a phone call, or preferably a meet up. I had made my decision and wasn't going to do this over text. He texted me back about an hour later, asking me if I had made my decision. I told him that I did, which is why I reached out to him. We called and I told him that I was keeping the baby. I'm 27, have had an extremely traumatic miscarriage at 12-13 weeks, and an abortion I deeply regret and still mourn to this day. And I also didn't want to go through another abortion in less than 2 years. I am having my baby that I've been actually wanting for so long.

He sounded shocked, but also... Happy? There wasn't any anger or frustration, to my own surprise. Believe it or not, but we started talking like we usually would. What should have been a quick phone call ended up being a 2-hour phone call of us catching up, cracking up with each other, admitting that we miss each other, reminiscing and eventually meeting up. I went over his. We're all adults, everybody probably knows what happened. I ended up staying over at his for nearly an entire week, from Monday to Friday. We made love, we talked about things, we admitted that we cannot leave each other alone, we wanted to work on this between the two of us for the sake of our baby, we argued - all that. But he also demanded a paternity test after the baby is born because of me saying ''may I decide to keep the baby, it will have a father.'' Not only that, but he also kept telling me that he needs to see at least two pregnancy tests turn positive with his own eyes. Mind you, I had shown him the two pregnancy tests I took on the day I told him because that's what my GP asked me to do.

While we were intimate he would tell me how much he loves me, that I'm the only one he wants, that I need to stop pissing him off because he only wants me and nobody else. You know... All the things everybody wants to hear to feel wanted. Unfortunately his behavior towards me during the week I was with him would sometimes contradict his words. I would many times tell him to be kind to me, treat me as an individual instead of making me feel like I'm a human incubator and s\*x doll. His excuse was that he still had some issues with me due to the argument we had before we broke up. Because of this he wanted to sit down with me and my psychiatrist as a neutral third party for us to work through things. I agreed and made an appointment. I wanted to work on things as much as he did. Despite having multiple arguments, we also talked things out right away. We really wanted  to work on this for the baby, and also for us, that was my impression. There had been times where I wanted to leave, and I said so during arguments, I didn't. I had to remind myself that I can't always run when things become too much, especially not when a baby is involved or not to hurt the other person. So I stayed every time because I am teaching myself to stop leaving. Now I also need to learn that when I say ''I'm leaving'' I take it back and say ''That was a thought, but I'm not really going to. I want to talk things out.''

That Friday we argued, too. I ended up leaving at 12:00 a.m. because I had to go to my mother, but I also left because I didn't want to be around how him anymore. Not after the way we argued - I had asked him why he was so hellbent and commanding me about taking a pregnancy test in front of him. I don't mind, but he's been demanding it rather than asking me. He needs to see a form of confirmation to become calm about all of this, though he could have also asked for my medical report. However, I had yet to fully warm up to him too before I started fully sharing medical reports.

Anyway, I ended up becoming unwell at the train station once I arrived in the city my mother lives in 30 minutes. Paramedics had to tend to me because I almost fainted, and they ended up calling him to tell him what had happened to me. During that phone call he told them I was pregnant, which is something I didn't tell them myself. This led to an ambulance being called and after being examined in the ambulance, it turned out my blood sugar was extremely low and my blood pressure was a little higher than they had prefered. While talking to the paramedic, she had been asking me questions to know why I was out so late, why I didn't tell them about the pregnancy right away, if everything was okay between my boyfriend and I. I didn't want them to think badly about him or our dynamic, so I said we were fine. But I eventually slipped up and admitted that I was stressing and hadn't really eaten much because my boyfriend and I had been arguing. She said that that's not good and I really need to start thinking of myself and my baby. When he showed up at the ambulance, the paramedic really pressed him that I need to eat more and keep stress levels as low as possible.

Once I was good to go, he hugged me when we were outside and he told me to never scare him like that ever again. Also that I should know that he really loves and cares about me, to never question it ever again because he spent nearly 90 bucks on a taxi to come to me. We went back to mine and in the taxi he told me that, due to him going to work an hour away soon, he needs to tell at least someone that I'm pregnant. Preferably my dad. I didn't want to but I understood where he was coming from, so we agreed to do it the next day or he would call in sick. I told him not to call in sick, but let's do it on Sunday when he doesn't have to work. He insisted on the day he had to work, which I was opposed to, but I gave in. He assured me that we were going to tell my father (who I have a really close bond with btw!) together because I was anxious about it. I actually didn't want to do it, but he convinced me with his reassurance.

That night he asked me to be his girlfriend again. I had pretended to think, but I said yes. I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend again, too, to which he said yes as well. But he had a few conditions: I start eating more, stop stressing less, we see a psychiatrist at least once a month to work through our issues and I tell my dad that I am expecting. We shook and pinky promised on it and were officially back together.

**The next day was an absolute shit show, which is why we are where we are now**

He wanted to talk to my father. After waking me up at least three times (I fell asleep around 6 a.m. but even so, I'm pregnant and extremely tired and also coming down from the previous night) to see if I had  spoken to my dad, I texted my dad. He wasn't up yet around the time I texted him, but my partner kept asking if my dad had texted back yet. If I had heard anything back. Every time I would tell him no, that my dad tends to wake up around 12-1 p.m. He insisted I call him or we just go over to his place unannounced. Now I know my dad — he does not like unexpected visitors (neither do I btw) and he also isn't the type to answer his phone when he's sleeping. My partner kept asking me and telling me what to do in regards of getting in contact with my father, and I kept reassuring him that he will get back to me. His reasoning being that he was behaving like that was because he had to go to work. Something I completely understood.

My dad eventually got back to me and I told him we'd call him around 2 p.m. He said he wasn't home and he'd call me when he did. I agreed with him, told my partner this, but that wasn't good enough for him because he needed/wanted to talk to my dad when it was convenient to *him* only. However, that wasn't going to happen. Time passed, we were intimate, the energy had settled and we were just cuddling. 2 p.m. struck and my partner started becoming restless because my dad had yet to call or reach out. A few minutes later I received a voice note from my dad telling me that he's still on his way home, but that he'd call me as soon as he was inside. I told my partner this after he asked me if I heard anything from my dad. That didn't necessarily calm him, leaving him to still be anxious. As a way to relax he asked if I wanted to have s\*x to which I kindly turned him down because I was extremely nauseous and tired as well. He said: ''Alright, I'll deal with my anxiety myself then.'' and turned his back to me to lay. Me being me, I cuddled up to him, stroke and kissed his back, as a way to help him calm down. In less than 10 minutes he jumped up saying that he's too anxious and he has to go. That he has only been back at mine for less than 24 hrs and he's already anxious being here. This caught me of guard and I reminded him that he can't leave because he promised we would tell my dad together.

Somewhat of a light argument ensued, in which he kept saying he's going to go, he has to leave. I kept reminding him of his promise, but he didn't seem to care for any of that, just his anxiety. I told him to just go then because he's starting to make me worked up, that I'll tell my dad myself because ''I do everything my damn self all the time anyway.'' He doubled down saying that he didn't want to leave but all of this was making him anxious because we HAVE to tell my dad and my dad was taking forever.

It turned out that my dad's cousin, who is staying with him, was home and to preserve my privacy my dad hadn't called me yet. To calm things down for my partner, I texted my dad and told him the news (not how I wanted to do it, btw) along with an explanation that my partner is really anxious and also has to go to work, all this waiting is making him restless. My dad was quick to say that he already sensed that I'm pregnant but he was waiting for me to tell him myself. I told my partner this and for a moment he seemed to calm down. I sat down next to him because he asked and we talked for a little. Then he became anxious again. I tried to calm him down, even telling him to call in sick from work by telling them that I have a medical emergency, but he insisted that he couldn't. He kept saying that it was too late for him to call in sick now, that I should have told him the night prior or this morning (I was sleeping) because I know he takes things literal. I told him that it's not my responsibility, but I am telling him to do so now. He kept repeating himself, even saying that he knew that this was going to happen. That he can't trust my words. Then doubled down saying that he's lashing out at me because of my dad's behavior, that the anxiety isn't my fault but my dad's.

Once my dad finally called, instead of staying my partner decided that he can't do it and he left. He literally left right as my dad called and left me to do something I didn't want to do and he promised we would do together. Disappointed would be an understatement. My dad tried calling him personally a few times, but he didn't answer. When he finally called my dad back they made plans to meet up the next day, on Sunday, to talk. Mind you, my partner is the one who initiated to talk with my dad. I called to check in on him, see if he spoke with my father and he did. BUT then he told me he's trying to reschedule this 'talk' to two weeks later because his father wants to be there, too. WHY? Because they believe that he, a grown ass man who initiated this conversation ABOUT ME with my own father, shouldn't be having the conversation without his father. That where I asked him what the H\*ll he's doing and nothing is being discussed with me. **Also that this is ridiculous since we're 27 and not 15 or 16 year olds!!!!!** He quickly deflected telling me that if the phone call is going to be a one way conversation or that is the tone (a firm one to set boundaries..) I'm going to talk to him in before work that he's going to end the call. I hung up, took a breather and called back trying to have the conversation again. He tried to justify his actions by saying that if he's going to be talking to my father, his father should be there too, which really agitated me because my autonomy seemed to not be respected. And this is NOT the first time he has done something like this. Out of frustration, hurt, defeat, stripped from my autonomy, I screamed: ''You know what I'm just going to have an abortion at this point. I'll call the clinic on Monday. I can't do this anymore.'' I ended the call and called my father crying.

My father, of course, was not pleased with any of this. Mind you, I actually really want this baby and have yet been able to let any of it sink in so I can be happy. I told my dad all of this too, and that he (my partner) had already told family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances that I am expecting. He did this without my consent, without my knowledge and far before I was even sure about my choice. Not only that, but I was only 5-6 weeks at most at the time. I haven't even marked 9 weeks yet as I'm writing this... So please understand why I was so frustrated and hurt about my autonomy OR privacy not being respected. His reasoning being, again, ''People could tell I was going through something, I couldn't hide it. I was too anxious.'' Mind you, again, all these weeks and days I have been dealing with all of this alone. Nobody, except my best friend who I haven't even told my final decision because I wanted to surprise her with the news, knows!

Anyway... I spoke to my dad most of the day, telling him how I don't want an abortion again. How I'm hurting. I even reached out to his father to clear the air, especially when it comes to this big misunderstanding that our fathers and him need to sit with each other. And I also made it very clear that I do not like that fact that our parents are getting involved in this. Despite me kindly asking his father to get back to me to talk about this (also so I could apologize for this chaotic mess that his son has created), his dad never did. It has been 4 days or so. Yet it was a problem when my dad couldn't call us quick enough.

I ended up needing medical attention again that night. I fainted again due to stress and a low blood sugar from not eating enough. The conversation I had with the paramedics was emotionally intense because, upon looking in my medical file and seeing that I needed medical attention the night prior as well for the same reasons, they were worried. Again I didn't tell them about what happened between him and I earlier, but with how kind and persuasive they can be, I ended up opening up. They said that I was in an emotionally unsafe environment (again) and that I might consider seeking a form of help for this. And also that I needed to really start taking care of myself better for the sake of my baby. They didn't say it's emotional abuse, but they did say that I am exposed to someone who is emotionally unsafe for me and that other licensed professionals might consider this something more serious. Especially after I opened up about our phone call and showed them a few text exchanges.

After they left I was left in shambles and I reach out to him. He was at work, but I took it upon myself to approach him with transparency and respect about all of this. We ended up calling the next day, despite me prefering to do it face to face. He said he was too tired to come to my place and I could have suggested coming to his. That's true, but that didn't cross my mind nor did I feel like I was welcome.

I’ve always believed in fairness, and I never want him to feel like I'd use the system being in the mother's benefit or our current situation against him may it have to come that far. I even went as far as sharing with him what rights he does and doesn’t have legally — especially considering we’re not married. Also because there have been moments that have been documented in my medical file, prior to the pregnancy, that arguments between us have led to severe emotional distress for me. On one occasion with me even harming myself due to how I was spoken to by him and needing psychological crisis intervention. Me harming myself was not his fault, however the way he spoke to me knowing where I was and how I was doing mentally was a big trigger for me. I made sure he knew these things in detail so he wouldn't be caught off guard, may he choose to continue treating me as he is or even distancing himself from the pregnancy.

I told him that under the law in the country we live in (I do not know about other countries yet), I would be the primary caregiver, but I also made it clear that I wasn’t trying to take advantage of that. I wanted him to be informed, to be part of the pregnancy from the very start — because that’s what equality looks like to me. Also because I always knew how important the role of being a father is to him. I also want things to be fair and transparent between us for both of us and the child in the healthiest way possible.

I told him everything. From what the paramedics discussed with me up until his rights (I did some deep research due to how he kept talking about his rights multiple times). He listened and thanked me afterwards for being honest with him. He knows that I didn't owe it to him. Then he asked what I needed from him during this time.

I told him the truth: I need him to stop causing me stress, to start being kinder to me, and to stop sharing private things about my pregnancy with others without my consent. I said it starts with the mother — if I’m not okay, the baby isn’t okay. And if he continues to be a source of distress, that’s not just harmful to me and the baby, but it can work against him in the long run if this ever ended up in court. Which is something I really do ***not*** want. I also asked him to stop making my pregnancy a public topic in his circle before we’ve even had space to figure things out ourselves, since that was our initial goal as the weeks went by.

During that phone call, I also asked him what he needed, what he wanted. I was trying to keep things open and mutual. But he kept saying he was afraid to tell me anything because he didn’t trust me, that anything he said might be used against him. That he felt like I’d weaponize his words. That really hurt. I was trying so hard to be transparent, to keep him in the loop, to honor both our perspectives. I even said — look, I’m telling you things I don’t even **have** to tell you, I’m going out of my way to make sure you’re informed and involved, and you still think I’m going to blindside you?

Eventually, the call ended kind of awkwardly, if I say so myself. Then about 15–30 minutes later, he called again. He said he needed to be honest and if he could without me being reactive. I told him that I'd love to, I'm here for him. He told me he felt like I was taking away his freedom. That he couldn’t be himself because of me. That by asking him not to share details about the pregnancy with others (yet), I was making him feel like he had no outlet, no voice. And then, almost casually, he dropped that he was “looking at bridges” — implying he was suicidal. My boundaries, once again (since this isn't the first time), were making him uncomfortable and suicidal.

I froze. I started becoming upset because that is NOT a position I want to put anyone in for the sake of my emotional safety. That completely broke me. I said, fine, just talk to whoever you need to talk to. Do what you need to feel okay. I lifted the boundary I set, despite it being there to protect my own peace and privacy, just to ease his discomfort. I ended up being the one crying, getting worked up, feeling torn to shreds, but somehow I was the one to soothe him again. To make sure he was okay. He even said that he wasn't sure whether we were still together, he assumes we weren't with the way I had spoken to him the day before, that it was very unclear to him. I became even more upset over that. In a bit of an indifferent voice he soothed me, telling me that he's there and that he's not going anywhere. For me to calm down and stop stressing.

Once the realization settled that I lifted the boundary for him he said he felt lighter. He thanked me and started talking to me in a warmer and kinder voice. That came after he told me that the way I told him to go talk to whoever he needs to talk to was unkind of me. That if I wanted him to be kind, I should be doing the same thing to him. So I ended up apologizing for what I said at least five times, and rephrasing myself entirely.

Later that night, I ended up checking in on him (because of course I did). I asked how he was doing, if he had managed to talk to anyone. He replied that he hadn’t yet, but was just processing everything that had been said and done. No “how are you,” no checking in on me, no acknowledgment of my breakdown. Nothing.

Then on Monday, we were supposed to meet up — I had agreed to take the pregnancy test in his presence, so he could be involved and finally feel a sense of mental calmness. Last minute, the morning of, he canceled. After commanding, demanding, pushing for me to do this for him. He texted me that he had thought everything over, and in with everything that happened the previous 72 hours, he decided that he didn’t want to see me that day. That he needed two weeks of minimal to no contact to “process everything and figure out for himself how to move forward in the healthiest way for all parties.” He signed the message “sincerely yours” and his name, like it was some formal resignation letter.

I didn’t reply. I just sat with it.

**And I realized something I’ve been avoiding for a long time:** this man will never change. Not even if a child is involved. No matter how beautiful and sweet he sells his words. That emotionally immature, self-centered, emotionally manipulative version of him is always going to show up eventually. Even when I only see the good in him — how sweet, kind, sensitive and thoughtful he is as well. But I also know I can’t keep sacrificing my needs and my peace just to keep him stable.

I, too, am still processing all of this while being pregnant still. I’m grieving so much. I feel betrayed, exhausted, emotionally depleted. I don’t even know what to expect from these two weeks of space because I don't even know where we stand. All I know is that I can’t keep breaking myself to hold him together. Not us, but **him**.

Thanks for reading. I don’t even know what I’m asking for — maybe just your thoughts whether is my BPD possibly effing things up, maybe some clarity or advice on the situation, or validation that I’m actually not losing it. Even if you think I'm totally in the wrong, call me out on it please so I can learn from this. Anything, really. I need to have conversations with people from outside each our circles.

TL;DR: I’m about 8 weeks pregnant and shared the news with my partner, who then told his family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances out of anxiety despite me asking him to keep it to himself as I decide whether I'm keeping the baby or not since we were broke up. He wanted to tell to my dad about the pregnancy after I needed medical help, which caused tension between us. There were delays and miscommunications with my dad for him, and my partner struggled with waiting and felt overwhelmed. This left him bailing on me despite promising to tell my dad together. Despite my efforts to be transparent and set boundaries, he felt like his freedom was being limited, and shared that it was causing him to struggle emotionally. After a tough 72 hours for the both of us, he asked for space for the coming two weeks to process everything, and I’m left trying to balance my own needs while navigating this complicated situation. I’m trying to figure out what’s best for all of us moving forward.",1,1748451440.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I dated someone in my grad cohort on a casual basis for 5 months. She alternated between emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility (she is a “party girl” who told me she enjoys playing mind games with guys she hooks up with at the club, whereas I am shy and can’t imagine deliberately sowing confusion in another’s life) early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, I inquired as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision. She was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun exploring options, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years. She had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt infatuated, despite my misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a text to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive and like an attempt to isolate me from our peers.

Why do you think she would do something like this? Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus?",2,1748451350.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

The control room didn’t have windows. No one who worked there needed them. What it had was light—cold, clinical, never blinking. And screens. Dozens of them. Rows of cameras, street overlays, biofeeds, sensor readouts. Surveillance had long stopped pretending to be hidden. In Safe Zones, it was part of the landscape.

Joe sat in his chair, a molded seat that conformed to his spine a little too well, as if to say: “You live here now.”

His eyes scanned five feeds at once while another six floated in his periphery. A boy chased a dog with a plastic bat. A woman argued with a trader over the price of synthetic grain. A garbage drone stalled on 7th and had to be rebooted remotely. Minor things. Background noise.

But Joe wasn’t bored. He’d learned not to be. It was always the background noise that turned loudest.

He sipped lukewarm coffee from a metal mug etched with the Control insignia: a perfect black circle flanked by two stylized wings. Beneath it, the slogan that had come to define the post-collapse legal system: *Observe. Evaluate. Decide.*

“Console 3, this is Violet on 6. You getting bioflag on Sector 14-B?”

Joe tapped his mic. “Copy, Violet. Got it. Child tag. Sending zoom.”

The screens shifted, three feeds converging on a dusty courtyard where a group of kids played in the dirt. Most were laughing. One wasn’t.

The boy in question—tagged as Milo-43B—was holding a length of rebar and circling another child. His face was flushed, expression taut. The other child had backed up against a wall, arms raised.

“Threat level yellow,” Joe muttered. “Monitor’s calling up his history.”

A small window opened beside the feed. Milo had one previous flag: verbal aggression, no physical contact. No prior adult intervention. No record of trauma.

“He’s about to swing,” Violet said.

“Drone is holding position,” Joe said, more to himself than to her. “Awaiting caller decision.”

The drone hovered above the courtyard like a silver wasp, triangular wings humming quietly. Its red eye pulsed once, then again, awaiting command.

Joe leaned forward.

He tapped a key.

“Runner requested. Need eyes on scene.”

While the drones and screens did most of the work, there were still people who went outside. Runners, they were called now, but in another world, they might’ve been detectives, counselors, or social workers. Out here, their job was simple: confirm the emotional truth of what a drone could only measure.

Cass was one of the best.

She arrived at the courtyard seventeen minutes after Joe’s request, dressed in plain synthweave and a vest marked with the Control emblem.

Milo was sitting on a bench now, the rebar at his feet, head down.

The other kids had scattered.

Cass looked up. The drone acknowledged her with a chirp and drifted higher.

“Tell me what happened,” she said, sitting beside him.

Milo didn’t answer at first. He looked about ten, maybe eleven. Dirt-smudged, skinny, all knees and elbows.

“He called my mom a Null,” he said finally.

Cass nodded.

“And what’s a Null?”

“A nothing. Someone who wasn’t registered. Someone who doesn’t matter.”

“Is your mom untagged?”

He hesitated. “She was. She got tagged last year. Took us forever.”

Cass took a slow breath. “So you felt like he was insulting your family.”

Milo nodded.

“Did you mean to hurt him?”

“No. Just scare him.”

She stood, scanned the area, then tapped her wristpad. “Runner report filed. No sustained threat. Recommend de-escalation protocol.”

The drone blinked green once and silently flew away.

Back in the control room, Joe read the report and leaned back. Cass’s assessment matched his. Threat level downgraded. Incident filed.

He closed the feed.

“Console 3, you good?” Violet’s voice came through.

“Always.”

“Good, because we’ve got a 20-4 near downtown. Package left on bench, no ID trace. Want to tag it?”

Joe was already pulling the feed.

The object in question was a black case, rectangular, sitting neatly on a broken bench beside a bus shelter. Too clean. No dust. No wear.

Drone-9 circled above it in slow, patient loops.

Joe called up chemical sniffer data. No explosives detected. No radiological spikes. The case wasn’t hot.

“Runner en route?”

“Yeah, Darren. Two minutes out.”

Joe flagged the case as low-priority suspicious and moved on.

It was like that every day. Watch. Evaluate. Decide. Most things were harmless. But sometimes...

Sometimes the worst things looked completely ordinary.

Joe had been a caller for six years. Before that, he was a street tech, climbing poles to fix camera drones, patching fiber lines beneath broken sidewalks. He’d seen what the world was like before Safe Streets—back when armed gangs ran trade routes, when settlements rose and burned like kindling, when everything felt *temporary*.

He didn’t miss those days.

But he missed the *choices*.

Because now, decisions didn’t feel entirely human.

Every judgment Joe made was reviewed by others—callers like him in other buildings, other cities. They watched the same feeds, read the same reports, voted. The system preferred consensus.

When the decision was close—three to two, or worse—the AI made the final call.

And AI never explained itself.

“Console 3, I’ve got a priority flag,” Violet said, voice suddenly tight.

Joe tapped into the new feed.

A man was dragging a child—screaming—down a side alley.

Drone overhead, weapons cold. Awaiting caller input.

Joe pulled bio data. The man was tagged as Gordon Reeve. No priors. Registered guardian of the child. But the child’s ID—Anya—was triggering stress markers off the chart. Elevated heart rate. Microfractures in the wrist from how tightly she was being held.

“Runner ETA?” Joe asked.

“Eight minutes. Too far.”

Joe’s heart rate ticked up.

He reviewed facial analysis. The man’s expression was unreadable. Too flat. Could be dissociation. Could be routine parenting. Could be abduction.

“Do we act?” Violet whispered.

Joe looked at the screen.

Then he pressed the red button.

“Immediate intervention. Drone, non-lethal stun. Target: Gordon Reeve.”

A soft click acknowledged his command. The drone dipped, hissed, and released a thin arc of electric current.

Reeve crumpled. The child ran.

Later that night, Joe reviewed the footage again.

Turns out Gordon Reeve was the child’s father. He hadn’t intended harm. Anya had run into the alley after a lost toy. Gordon had panicked, grabbed her too hard, said nothing.

The AI downgraded the incident to ""overreach."" No charges. Counseling ordered.

Joe was not reprimanded. His actions were within standard margin.

Still, he stared at the screen long after the file closed.

Sometimes, people asked him if he felt like a judge.

He didn’t.

A judge could speak. A judge could ask questions, wait for answers.

Joe’s job was different. Quieter. He sat in a chair, behind a wall of screens, and tried to see through the blur of humanity.

He tried to be fair.

But even fairness felt mechanical some days.

The drone feeds didn’t show backstories. They didn’t show fear or shame or context. That was why the system still needed humans.

But it needed *many* humans. No one caller had absolute power. Even Joe’s decisions were washed in the collective—sanded down by committee, polished by AI.

“Console 3,” Violet said as the night rolled on, “you ever wonder if we get it wrong?”

Joe looked out across the glowing city feeds, street after street lit with sterile safety.

“All the time,” he replied.

But he stayed in his chair.

Because Safe Streets weren’t perfect.

But they were safer than what came before.

I used to eat only processed food. Then I did big weight cuts (lost 100lb in global) mostly by cutting carbs hard. During those phases, I barely had **1g of salt/day**. Since then, I’ve had:

* Slow digestion, food stays in my stomach
* Constipation (sometimes severe)
* Fatigue, heavy legs, dizzy when standing
* Anxiety, especially with coffee (I drank 3 cups/day)
* Excessive sweating during workouts (1h every 2 days)

Recently I started fixing things:

* **400mg magnesium**, **3g salt**, **3g potassium/day**
* **Less fiber**, **less coffee**
* **2L water/day** (before I peed all the time — now much better)

Results: anxiety and fatigue are better, better sleep, digestion improved \~50%, but it’s still slow. I think I have **low stomach acid**, food sits too long.

**Questions:**

1. Can low electrolytes mess up stomach acid or dry out the gut?
2. How long to fully recover after years of poor electrolyte intakes?
3. Any tips to improve digestion further? Are these amounts enough?

1/2 tsp salt
__________________________________

Wet ingredients. 

1/2 cup quality olive oil 

1/2 cup dark brown or coconut sugar

4 very ripe Bananas 

1/2 cup plain yogurt, I use Kite Hill plant based, either Greek or Almond milk yogurt.

1 tsp real vanilla extract 

1/4 to 1/2 cup walnuts 

Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl

In another bowl mash the Bananas and all wet ingredients really well.

Add dry to the wet and fold it in until all wet and mixed thoroughly but don't over mix, just fold it in.
Add walnuts.

Put a strip of parchment paper into a cast iron loaf pan and pour in batter, poke it down and shake a little to get rid of any bubbles.

Put into preheated oven at 350⁰ for about 75 minutes until tooth pick come out clean.

Optional, you can add 4 tablespoons of pea protein if you want to up the protein and amino acids.
Overall this is a fairly healthy desert as deserts go, its high in numerous nutrients plus fiber from and protein from FMF and flavanols from the cocoa, the worst ingredient is just the half cup dark brown or coconut sugar.

Then there's the option to sully it up which most of the time I do by adding frosting.

For frosting I take about 1/2 cup powdered sugar, add a tsp cocoa and at least 2 tsp of Ceylon cinnamon,  a splash of vanilla extract. 
I take a couple spoonfuls of that and mix it thin, can use whatever I usually use my coffee creamer,  make it pretty thin.
Poke holes with a bamboo skewer all over the top and spoon the thin icing on while cake hot out of oven to let it sink in.

Then after cake has cooled mix the rest thicker to make more of a icing and spread on top.

Even with the extra 1/2 cup sugar this is healthier than most deserts.
Its plant based if you want it be or just use regular yogurt etc.

Hope you are all managing as best as you can during these situations.

I have posted before about my spouse and I going from separated with talks of reconciliation to them telling me that they don’t see us working out and our marriage has reached its end. We had started marriage therapy and had a few sessions, eventually had a falling out as I came to terms with them having an emotional affair and some of the nasty things they said to me in our last talks before hand and before our first session as a separated couple, and less than a month separated, I was told they were done.

I felt a bit blindsided because I understood people checking out long before and if someone doesn’t want to continue together then I wouldn’t fight to keep someone where they no longer want to be, but I wasn’t the one who insisted on this all being temporary and that couples need space to grow individually before being able to be stronger. 

I think I could have handled them telling me that as hard as it is, they were done and not interested in coming back especially since we barely interacted in the month or two before in efforts to do our own thing.

Now they keep saying how things don’t have to get nasty, that they want this to be as amicable as possible, and how splitting things 50/50 without legal is how they would like to address it all. Someone mentioned that it could be guilt from either asking for the end or from betrayal. Even until this past week they aren’t one for taking much accountability if any and after confronting them with the betrayal they basically said it was my experience and I had many opportunities to bring it up if it was true. Which I had addressed only to be shutdown or told it wasn’t relevant.

Still after talking to my therapist, she has advised me to get a good lawyer, minimize contact and separate funds. After describing their behavior to them, my therapist is almost certain they have been checked out for a long time before we even started joint counseling.

For the legal part or ownership,

We have been married less than 5 years, only have our house in our names, no kids, a cat which they are taking, they have a degree and make about 15k more than I do and I am in the service. We obviously have furniture, appliances and decorations though many have been bought on my cards and then sorted out later.

I’ve been paying the mortgage off one of my two monthly paychecks since the start of our marriage while they would deposit about 300$ to a joint account a month. They claim the majority of the decorations, couch, table, coffee table, fireplace and our office couch. 

Any advice for this? It’s been less than a week since told they were done. Someone suggested not immediately telling them that I am getting legal and many say to take lead and try to get it done as fast as possible. ",7,1748451106.0,Divorce,5,1.0,False

Naps have been resorted to contact naps at this point, as she scream cries as soon as I put her in her crib for a nap and won't settle.

Bedtime is still going smoothly, but now she isn't sleeping through the night consistently anymore. In the last 2 weeks she has woken up 4 times screaming at like 1:30 a.m. I go in to comfort her but she does not go back down and I always resort to sleeping on the floor of her bedroom so she'll go back to sleep. We had another episode of this last night and I am so freaking tired and my back hurts from sleeping on the floor.

Google is telling me it's normal for a sleep regression to happen around this age, but I am so over it already. It gives me anxiety when she doesn't sleep well and I have disrupted sleep. She's also so clingy to me (mom) and only wants me. So my husband can't even take a shift.

The control room didn’t have windows. No one who worked there needed them. What it had was light, cold, clinical, never blinking. And screens. Dozens of them. Rows of cameras, street overlays, biofeeds, sensor readouts. Surveillance had long stopped pretending to be hidden. In Safe Zones, it was part of the landscape.

Joe sat in his chair, a molded seat that conformed to his spine a little too well, as if to say: “You live here now.”

His eyes scanned five feeds at once while another six floated in his periphery. A boy chased a dog with a plastic bat. A woman argued with a trader over the price of synthetic grain. A garbage drone stalled on 7th and had to be rebooted remotely. Minor things. Background noise.

But Joe wasn’t bored. He’d learned not to be. It was always the background noise that turned loudest.

He sipped lukewarm coffee from a metal mug etched with the Control insignia: a perfect black circle flanked by two stylized wings. Beneath it, the slogan that had come to define the post-collapse legal system: *Observe. Evaluate. Decide.*

“Console 3, this is Violet on 6. You getting bioflag on Sector 14-B?”

Joe tapped his mic. “Copy, Violet. Got it. Child tag. Sending zoom.”

The screens shifted, three feeds converging on a dusty courtyard where a group of kids played in the dirt. Most were laughing. One wasn’t.

The boy in question—tagged as Milo-43B—was holding a length of rebar and circling another child. His face was flushed, expression taut. The other child had backed up against a wall, arms raised.

“Threat level yellow,” Joe muttered. “Monitor’s calling up his history.”

A small window opened beside the feed. Milo had one previous flag: verbal aggression, no physical contact. No prior adult intervention. No record of trauma.

“He’s about to swing,” Violet said.

“Drone is holding position,” Joe said, more to himself than to her. “Awaiting caller decision.”

The drone hovered above the courtyard like a silver wasp, triangular wings humming quietly. Its red eye pulsed once, then again, awaiting command.

Joe leaned forward.

He tapped a key.

“Runner requested. Need eyes on scene.”

While the drones and screens did most of the work, there were still people who went outside. Runners, they were called now, but in another world, they might’ve been detectives, counselors, or social workers. Out here, their job was simple: confirm the emotional truth of what a drone could only measure.

Cass was one of the best.

She arrived at the courtyard seventeen minutes after Joe’s request, dressed in plain synthweave and a vest marked with the Control emblem.

Milo was sitting on a bench now, the rebar at his feet, head down.

The other kids had scattered.

Cass looked up. The drone acknowledged her with a chirp and drifted higher.

“Tell me what happened,” she said, sitting beside him.

Milo didn’t answer at first. He looked about ten, maybe eleven. Dirt-smudged, skinny, all knees and elbows.

“He called my mom a Null,” he said finally.

Cass nodded.

“And what’s a Null?”

“A nothing. Someone who wasn’t registered. Someone who doesn’t matter.”

“Is your mom untagged?”

He hesitated. “She was. She got tagged last year. Took us forever.”

Cass took a slow breath. “So you felt like he was insulting your family.”

Milo nodded.

“Did you mean to hurt him?”

“No. Just scare him.”

She stood, scanned the area, then tapped her wristpad. “Runner report filed. No sustained threat. Recommend de-escalation protocol.”

The drone blinked green once and silently flew away.

Back in the control room, Joe read the report and leaned back. Cass’s assessment matched his. Threat level downgraded. Incident filed.

He closed the feed.

“Console 3, you good?” Violet’s voice came through.

“Always.”

“Good, because we’ve got a 20-4 near downtown. Package left on bench, no ID trace. Want to tag it?”

Joe was already pulling the feed.

The object in question was a black case, rectangular, sitting neatly on a broken bench beside a bus shelter. Too clean. No dust. No wear.

Drone-9 circled above it in slow, patient loops.

Joe called up chemical sniffer data. No explosives detected. No radiological spikes. The case wasn’t hot.

“Runner en route?”

“Yeah, Darren. Two minutes out.”

Joe flagged the case as low-priority suspicious and moved on.

It was like that every day. Watch. Evaluate. Decide. Most things were harmless. But sometimes...

Sometimes the worst things looked completely ordinary.

Joe had been a caller for six years. Before that, he was a street tech, climbing poles to fix camera drones, patching fiber lines beneath broken sidewalks. He’d seen what the world was like before Safe Streets—back when armed gangs ran trade routes, when settlements rose and burned like kindling, when everything felt *temporary*.

He didn’t miss those days.

But he missed the *choices*.

Because now, decisions didn’t feel entirely human.

Every judgment Joe made was reviewed by others—callers like him in other buildings, other cities. They watched the same feeds, read the same reports, voted. The system preferred consensus.

When the decision was close—three to two, or worse—the AI made the final call.

And AI never explained itself.

“Console 3, I’ve got a priority flag,” Violet said, voice suddenly tight.

Joe tapped into the new feed.

A man was dragging a child—screaming—down a side alley.

Drone overhead, weapons cold. Awaiting caller input.

Joe pulled bio data. The man was tagged as Gordon Reeve. No priors. Registered guardian of the child. But the child’s ID—Anya—was triggering stress markers off the chart. Elevated heart rate. Microfractures in the wrist from how tightly she was being held.

“Runner ETA?” Joe asked.

“Eight minutes. Too far.”

Joe’s heart rate ticked up.

He reviewed facial analysis. The man’s expression was unreadable. Too flat. Could be dissociation. Could be routine parenting. Could be abduction.

“Do we act?” Violet whispered.

Joe looked at the screen.

Then he pressed the red button.

“Immediate intervention. Drone, non-lethal stun. Target: Gordon Reeve.”

A soft click acknowledged his command. The drone dipped, hissed, and released a thin arc of electric current.

Reeve crumpled. The child ran.

Later that night, Joe reviewed the footage again.

Turns out Gordon Reeve was the child’s father. He hadn’t intended harm. Anya had run into the alley after a lost toy. Gordon had panicked, grabbed her too hard, said nothing.

The AI downgraded the incident to ""overreach."" No charges. Counseling ordered.

Joe was not reprimanded. His actions were within standard margin.

Still, he stared at the screen long after the file closed.

Sometimes, people asked him if he felt like a judge.

He didn’t.

A judge could speak. A judge could ask questions, wait for answers.

Joe’s job was different. Quieter. He sat in a chair, behind a wall of screens, and tried to see through the blur of humanity.

He tried to be fair.

But even fairness felt mechanical some days.

The drone feeds didn’t show backstories. They didn’t show fear or shame or context. That was why the system still needed humans.

But it needed *many* humans. No one caller had absolute power. Even Joe’s decisions were washed in the collective—sanded down by committee, polished by AI.

“Console 3,” Violet said as the night rolled on, “you ever wonder if we get it wrong?”

Joe looked out across the glowing city feeds, street after street lit with sterile safety.

“All the time,” he replied.

But he stayed in his chair.

Because Safe Streets weren’t perfect.

But they were safer than what came before.

In the city of Praxelia, progress doesn't knock - it overwrites.

A year after the Human Threshold Accords divided society by flesh and circuitry, tensions between the Ascendents and the Purists is quickly reaching a boil. When  routine procedures begin to end in catastrophe, Ascendent leadership blames Purist sabotage - but the truth is buried in encrypted data and dead minds.

Nova Cale, an Ascendent engineer with a knack for solving problems no one else sees, is unexpectedly elevated for a breakthrough she didn't know had consequences. Her innovations catch the eye of Lucius Ward, the enigmatic visionary at the helm of the Ascendents, and architect of a secret project called the Echo Protocol.

As Nova is drawn deeper into a web of synthetic philosophy, buried guilt and ambition, she begins to uncover the true purpose of the Echo Protocol, Sovereign City, and those both brave and unfortunate enough to join her on this journey of transhumanism and ideological warfare.

When the line between memory and identity begins to fracture, Nova must decide whether the future Ward offers is salvation... or erasure.

The clipboard flicked back into the arms of the attending drone, which floated away without a word, its halo of biometric sensors flickering with greens and blues. A soft tone pinged through the room: ""*consent recorded.*"" The procedure was officially scheduled, nerves irrelevant.

Jaren Solas took off his pre-surgery cover as he stood. Beneath the fabric, from the skin of his elbow to his shoulder, had already been prepped - shaved, sterilized, marked with the faint grid lines used for a neural graft. It was real, he reminded himself. This was happening, and that was supposed to be good.

""You'll be fine,"" came a voice to his left. Calm and measured, too practiced to be comforting.

The attending physician - Ascendent, no doubt - glided forward with that same weightless confidence all of them seemed to carry. Her coat was sleeveless, woven from some self-cleaning polymer that glistened like static. Her eyes were soft, but modded. He could tell from the subtle shimmer in the irises. Depth-scanning overlays, he guessed. Probably could see the heartbeat in his neck.

""It's a simple graft,"" she said, smiling as if she'd said it a thousand times. ""A basic neural graft to interface with future arm modifications to better connect with your augmented spine. No different than getting a vaccine. You'll be asleep for the worst of it, and afterward... ""

""I'll be better,"" Jaren said automatically. ""Faster, calmer, more efficient."" He didn't know where he'd read the line. Probably on one of Praxelia's ambient ads.

The doctor nodded faintly, clearly satisfied. ""Exactly.""

But as she spoke, Jaren noticed the flicker in the overhead lights. Not a full outage, just a stutter. As though the building had hiccupped. None of the staff reacted, but maybe they were used to it. Perhaps it was part of the rhythm.

He tried to let it go.

They walked him down the corridor, which was seemingly piped with an orchestra of ambient sound that simulated wind through pine trees. Another classic Ascendent touch. Nature, prepackaged - delivered intravenously through nostalgia.

He entered the surgical chamber with slow steps, each one rebounding a little too clearly in his ears. He tried to think of anything but the machines; sleek, silent, all silver arcs and carbon arms. He tried not to look at the chair at the center. Reclining, exposed, anatomical.

As he lay down, the metal was already warming to his body temperature. A nice touch, luxury meant to calm the nerves. It didn't.

""You said you were nervous earlier,"" the doctor said, now masked, her voice filtered through a gentle aural modulator. ""That's normal. We like to think of the neural mesh not as an intrusion, but as an invitation. A handshake to your future self.""

Jaren chuckled. Thin and cracked, he asked, ""That some kind of Ascendent thing?""

""It's a truth thing,"" she replied, prepping the syringe. ""It's the future. And it's very polite.""

The sedative burned faintly as it entered his system. Not painful. Just...present. His limbs began to drift, vision blurring at the edges. His heart slowed.

But before the ceiling gave way to sleep, he saw it again.

A flicker.

This time, the lights didn't recover. There was a delay in the anesthesia sequence. The robotic arm on his right - meant to administer the graft paused mid-air. Not like a machine waiting for instruction, but more like a confused waiter forgetting where the tray should go.

A strange sound followed, not mechanical. Not organic - a hum, low underneath his ears. Then, a voice not from the staff, but from somewhere in the walls, spoke in what sounded like an Ascendent command-line that had burst. Jaren couldn't understand it, but he felt it behind his eyes.

""I - I think something's... "" he tried to sit up, but the chair refused to release. Straps clicked down automatically. Restraint and safety protocol, unfortunately standard. The doctor didn't flinch. But Jaren saw it in her eyes. That moment where certainty cracked.

""System override?"" she said, turning toward the console. ""Level-three system failure? No contingency? ""

No response.

He began to feel heat.

Not pain yet.

Just warmth. Spreading from the back of his neck.

""Stop,"" he said, voice rising. ""I didn't - I don't consent - ""

His vision pulsed red. Not externally, but inside. Like his optic nerves were being overwritten with code he couldn't read. His heart rate tripled. An alarm began to scream, but it sounded wrong: too low, too slow, as if someone had dropped the pitch of the world.

The last thing he saw was a nurse sprinting toward the emergency panel. Then her body arcing backward as if pulled by invisible hands.

The graft activated.

**Explosion.**

Not fire.

Sound.

Light.

Then silence.

Deep below the public levels of Praxelia - an adjacent sister metropolis to Sovereign City - the R&D facilities upper echelons pulsed with soft white light; engineered calm for a place where the consequences of failure were often lethal.

Lucius Ward stood before a console, his arms clasped behind his back, gaze steady on the dockets of biometric data unraveling across a suspended holopane.

His engineer - a gaunt man named Kreel - flicked through the same telemetry with trembling fingers. ""We lost all twelve subjects,"" he said quietly. ""Including the attending staff. When we attempt a neural graft on the subject, their mesh has premature synchronization with the systems responsible for housing our mainframes Echo lattice, despite the dampeners. It literally plugs them into our hardware. That shouldn't even be possible.""

Lucius didn't speak.

Kreel pressed on, voice sharpening. ""I told you the graft wasn't ready. Echo's mainframe link doesn't stabilize fast enough. They... the connections bleed, sir. From the *inside*. Some of them screamed before they lost verbal function. Others just... stopped.""

The images danced like ghosts: cortical spasm maps, heat fractures, arterial rupture patterns from twelve subjects. Behind him, Kreel paced.

""I warned you,"" Kreel said, voice taut, eyes sunken from too many sleepless weeks. ""I said the prototype wasn't ready. The mainframe sync in particular is unstable at the cortical level, every attempt forces a cascade failure in the patients limbic system.""

Lucius remained still.

Kreel flung a data slate onto the nearest surface. It clattered with an obnoxious rebound. ""Do you understand the scope of what just happened?""

Lucius exhaled slowly. Not weary - *patient.* ""They volunteered,"" he said softly.

""They volunteered to evolve,"" Kreel snapped. ""Not to be *erased*.""

More silence.

Lucius turned, slowly. The lighting caught the silver arc of his facial plating, throwing half his expression into gleaming abstraction.

""They gave their lives for something greater than survival,"" he said. ""They were part of this proving ground.""

Lucius stepped toward the center console, hand brushing its edge. The readouts reconfigured, filtering through encrypted overlays. Strategic feeds. Public channels. PR assets. He paused before beginning again.

""Spin it on the purists. Say they sabotaged our clinics. After what we've seen this year? They're primed for it. Besides, they've been too quiet lately. You can say they corrupted the mesh interface. That they weaponized our own technology against us. They need a reminder of what chaos looks like. What happens when 'purity' resists progress. This... incident, tragic as it was, offers them that reminder.""

""They were *Ascendents*,"" Kreel shot back. ""And now they're fuel for propaganda. Do you really expect the public to believe it was a Purist attack?""

""They'll believe what they *need* to believe,"" Lucius replied. ""A tragedy is only as useful as its framing.""

""You're going to use this to escalate,"" Kreel said quietly. ""As if the Human Threshold Accords weren't enough.""

Lucius nodded, gaze cold and calculating. ""Exactly one year since the Accords were signed, and already the world's divided by math. Tick below the percent line? You're a citizen. Tick above it?"" He smiled faintly. ""You're policy.""

Lucius paused, voice low. He looked over his shoulder, one eye reflecting the mesh-embedded readout still blinking **FAILURE** in a dull crimson loop.

""As for escalation? No,"" he said. ""I'm going to use it to *accelerate*.""

He tapped twice on the interface. A new data file queued - classified under Echo Protocol, Tier 3.

""Assign Nova Cale to lead diagnostics on the graft stabilization trials,"" he said. ""She cracked the cascade issue last quarter, but we didn't deploy her method. Do it quietly, I want to see how she handles pressure.""

Kreel hesitated. ""She's not high-clearance. Not even Ascendent tier.""

Lucius didn't blink. ""Then it'll be her baptism.""

Kreel's voice was hoarse. ""You're going to feed her to the experiment, aren't you?""

Lucius smiled. ""No, Kreel. I'm going to let her understand it. The way *I* understand it.""

Even deeper underground on the other side of the city, the hum of the fabrication console was steady, but Nova's jaw was not.

""This data's garbage,"" she muttered, tossing a diagnostic slab onto the table. ""Run it again.""

Her lab partner, a wiry older tech named Haen, rolled his eyes. ""That's the third re-run. The results are consistent.""

Nova pointed to the neural lattice schematics. ""Consistently *wrong*. The reactive mesh is spiking on biofeedback, which means it's either broken or someone doesn't know what they're building.""

Haen scowled. ""Or maybe the math's above your pay grade.""

Nova's eyes sparked. ""Or maybe you're scared I'm right and Ward picked the wrong engineer to supervise his miracle.""

The silence that followed made its own gravity.

Nova grabbed her tools and turned back to the bench. ""Let's test it again.""

She changed her inputs, and began the test runs again, but the mesh didn't respond. Not to the recalibrated node sequencing. Not to the temperature changes. Not even to the soft curses Nova muttered under her breath, which she was starting to believe had more scientific merit than half the automated suggestions the console kept spitting out.

She squinted at the reactive mesh laid out across the scaffold: thousands of microscale fibers suspended in a fractal grid of alloy tracery, each one designed to channel not electricity per se, but intention. All part of Ward's neural graft augment, clearly still experimental. Manufacture intention. Or that was the theory, anyway. Neural prediction. Subconscious sync. Cognitive osmosis.

Right now, it looked like a glitch wrapped in silver thread.

""You calibrated the relay tolerances backwards again,"" Haen said from across the bench, not looking up. ""The input signal's getting bounced into the pattern buffer instead of the lateral cascade.""

Nova didn't even flinch. ""No, I didn't. That was your patch, remember? You pushed for a feedback loop before verifying that the cascade was connected.""

He frowned, stepped around her shoulder. ""Yes, but that was because I ran the stabilization at default like the computer suggested.""

""Which would be fine,"" she snapped, ""if we were *still* working with the previous lattice array. But this mesh changes phase at the quantum level, so the buffer's interpreting any fluctuation as feedback.""

""So... turn it off?""

Nova gave him a look. ""Yes, let's disable the one thing that makes it revolutionary. Brilliant. I'll be sure to name the Nobel after you.""

Haen grunted, stepping back. ""I'm going on break.""

""Don't come back until you've read the schematics. Twice.""

The lab door hissed closed behind him, and for a moment, there was nothing. Just Nova and the mesh.

She leaned over it again, brow furrowed, breath held. The interface pulsed under the lens like it was breathing. Even inert, the material felt... aware. Not sentient, just unsettling.

She tapped into the console's override. Began isolating the signal scatter on microsecond intervals. One by one, she disabled every extraneous routine. Reducing the product back down to its basics. Trimmed noise. Rebuilt the load sequence from scratch.

Then on impulse, she added a modification that wasn't in the specs.

A frequency she remembered seeing once. Not in a manual, but rather in a dream. Perhaps a memory. Its hard to tell the difference when half your brain is talking to an empty room.

The mesh fluttered, then stopped. No anomalies.

She froze.

Nova stared at the scaffold, watching the threads align in real time, glowing faintly as they adapted to the newly mapped carrier frequency she'd introduced - a modulation vector, custom-forged and entirely unverified. The mesh had never behaved like this. Not after five cycles. Not after fifty. It shouldn't have worked.

But it had.

The resonance held steady. No signal collapse. No polarity drift. The predictive sync - *the one that always failed* \- was not only stable but refining itself, drawing cleaner inputs from her feedback loop than anything that was in the standard calibration suite had recommended previously.

She hadn't just duct-taped a workaround. She'd solved it.

The patterns from the buffer were integrating into the mesh in a way the Ascendent templates had never accounted for; layering, adapting, syncing at the quantum level with zero bleed. Zero.

She ran the test loop again. Once. Twice. Ten times.

No decay.

Nova sat down slowly, like someone who wasn't sure gravity still worked.

She tapped the console to start logging the new sequence into the database. Timestamped, source-coded, annotated with her operator ID. The auto-save flickered for a moment before confirming upload.

Confirmed.

*Mine,* she thought.

The breath that left her body was quiet, almost reverent. Not just a fix. Not just a lucky anomaly. A working solution. A cornerstone for the neural graft to finally stabilize in real-world conditions. She stood there for a while, just watching the mesh breathe under its containment field.

""You're not conscious,"" she murmured. ""But you're closer than you were an hour ago.""

The glow of the mesh reflected faintly in her eyes. For the first time in months, she felt something besides frustration pulsing beneath her ribs.

Pride.

The kind no one would probably notice.

""The bastard's going to love this,"" she said under her breath, smiling wryly. ""If he even knows I exist.""

She doubted Lucius Ward had ever stepped foot in this lab. But she had read his papers. Every broadcast. Every transcript. She'd even freeze-framed one of his interviews to analyze the reflection in his metal cheek, just to get a closer look at what kind of console he was using.

Nova knew he hadn't designed the mesh himself. Visionaries rarely did. They sketched dreams and threw them to the ones like her, buried beneath the weight of them. But this - *this* \- was a result he'd want to hear about.

And it had her name on it.

She sat down at her bench, alone again. The silence of the lab was no longer oppressive, it was earned. The calm after so many, many storms. Her tools lay where she'd left them. The stims still sat untouched in her drawer. The cold synth-coffee at her side tasted like recycled coolant, but she drank it anyway.

For the next hour, she tinkered in silence, cross-referencing the new waveform alignment, double-checking tolerances, layering backups.

Every five minutes, the mesh pinged back: **STABLE.**

After a while, Nova leaned back in her chair and let herself drift. Not to sleep; she didn't trust that much comfort - but to memory. She thought of her first circuit board, built out of desperation in a community school with parts older than her shoes. She thought of her brother's modder friends, the ones who used to trade bootleg code and grilled soy cakes under blown-out streetlights. She thought of her father, once, briefly, and then chose not to.

Instead, she stared at the ceiling and whispered:

""One hurdle down.""

Then, quieter:

""Only about a thousand to go.""

The lab was quiet again. Just the hum of containment fields and the faint tick of her coffee's reheat cycle. Nova leaned back in her chair and rubbed her eyes, the retinal haze of too many hours with light fields still ghosting in her vision. She gave the ceiling a lazy glance and muttered:

""System. Check messages.""

The ambient display pulsed awake - soft blue against dark steel. A synthetic voice responded, warm but indifferent. ""One new message received. Flagged priority: internal channel.""

Nova straightened slightly. *Internal?* ""Sender?"" she asked.

""Kreel Varn. Senior Systems Engineer, Tier 3.""

Her brow furrowed. Kreel? She hadn't interacted with him directly since her onboarding cycle. He usually hovered somewhere three floors above, invisible and omnipotent like the rest of the core engineers. ""Dictate message,"" she said.

The system hesitated. That was rare. ""Unable to comply. Message flagged for secured clearance, content classified due to sensitive criteria.""

Nova's chair creaked as she sat up fully. ""Seriously?""

""Seriously,"" the system replied, without irony.

She scowled. ""Override with engineering credential Cale-Nova-One-Zero-Four.""

""Override denied. Insufficient rank.""

Of course.

Intrigued now, Nova gave the room one last glance, like someone checking the street before crossing a quiet intersection - then shoved herself across the floor on her chair with a kick. The wheels hummed softly on the concrete as she glided over to the wall-mounted terminal.

The console recognized her approach and spun to life. She keyed in her local access ID, then tapped the message icon. There it was. A black envelope icon, outlined in gold filament.

**Sender: Varn, Kreel**

**Subject: Profile Flagged for Review – Tier Consideration**

**Encryption Status: Internal Only**

She tapped to open it.

*Nova,*

Nova stared at the screen for a long moment, lips pressed into a thin line. A promotion? Or a test. Either way, someone had finally looked her way...and she wasn't sure yet if she liked that.

* 16th March - broke my ankle (Tibia/Fibula) - incredibly lucky as was a clean break - went into A&E 3.30pm and was out by 9.30pm with X-rays taken, leg up to knee in plaster, and some painkillers/blood-thinners - opted for the zimmer frame as more stable than crutches.
* WEEK 1 - A lot of pain, hard to fall asleep (but when I did it was deep) and took forever just to get from the bed to the bathroom and vice versa. My partner basically turned our bedroom (in a house on 4 levels) into a mini apartment - with a fridge, tea and coffee making supplies, and the microwave - so I could mostly look after myself when he was at work. We also bought a wheelchair off Amazon (just over £100), got a ""grabber"" and I got him to put a dining chair in the bathroom for moving to after using the toilet so I could sit at the sink to brush my teeth/do skin-care etc. 
* WEEK 2 - The depression really kicked in and I just felt so down about barely being able to move. I also started to get insomnia due to just resting and not really tiring my body - I took it as a blessing and got wrapping birthday and Christmas gifts to benefit my future self! had my first Trauma Clinic appointment where I had a new flexi-glass cast, fresh X-rays and a consultation. There were concerns I may still need surgery, so rest and elevation were prescribed. This was the start of spending a fortune on Ubers to get me to the hospital as I'm the main driver - and my bf and mum do not drive. Will not miss that expense - sometimes £75 to the hospital and back. Maybe TMI but was able to have sex very carefully - missionary with my leg on some cushions. 
* WEEK 3 - This is where I started to feel more positive and Had another Trauma Clinic appointment where I had a fresh cast. First time full weight-bearing and they wanted me to go up steps for the x ray - hard when the cast is not smooth on the bottom and the steps are slippy metal! All healing well - but again - still not out of the woods for surgery so more rest and elevation. The cast was a little harder this time as they had to force my foot more into place than I could do myself - so had gas and air and it was a breeze!
* WEEK 4 - Again - I started to feel a bit more agile, able to move around with more ease and less pain. Had another Trauma Clinic appointment where I was just told to keep the cast on again - had more x-rays and consultant said looking good - hopefully next appointment would be cast removal and air boot. 
* WEEK 5 - More resting but able to get in my home office to start building up time spent on my office chair, ready for when I was able to return to work. At this point there was a lot of swelling when the ankle was down/or normally sat in a chair. 
* WEEK 6 - Another Trauma Clinic appointment - X-rays first and all looking good. I was given the all-clear and no surgery required. I cried from relief! I had the cast removed and was given an air boot which felt so uncomfortable and didn't feel like I could walk on it. I realised my heel was not all the way down, and it wasn't pumped up enough - made such a difference. I take a few tentative steps on it but am cautious as we were staying at a hotel/going to a comedy gig that evening so mostly got pushed about in a wheelchair by my bf! Turns out we got special access because of the chair and had amazing seats - one win for the broken ankle! However - I was struck down with excruciating tooth pain which but a bit of a dampener on the night. 
* WEEK 7 - 10 - This is where I really came on leaps and bounds - but only after 2 weeks of agony with my tooth, leading to emergency double extraction due to 2 x abscesses/infections. I think it hindered my progress as my body was fighting that, and the week after I stopped taking all the painkillers I was so sick! I also started an exercise programme with chair workouts, floor exercises and daily walks along my hallway! End of week 8 - took my first unaided steps in the boot (and eventually found wearing one of my platform ankle boots almost balanced the chunkiness of the airboot.) Week 9 - took my first walk on the boot with crutches (not zimmer); first solo walk outside the house up and down a 10 metre flat part for 20 mins to get some sunshine; first times up and down stairs on my own (bum scooting for most); then I took my first walk for about 10 mins with the airboot, no crutches or zimmer. We were able to stay overnight at a hotel at the end of week 9 and I could move with crutches and airboot to go get cocktails across the road and move about the hotel - though was tiring. Week 10 I took my first walk UP the stairs stood up, holding on with my hands; my first walk barefoot wearing ankle brace and using crutches; walking wearing normal shoes and crutches. At the end of week 10 I had my final trauma clinic appointment where I was discharged to physio - and just waiting an appointment. I had x-rays full weight bearing barefoot, and had an initial physio discussion about my fitness levels prior to the accident and where I want to get to. Finally - the best thing is a full 10 weeks after my accident - I was able to drive 45 minutes, stop and eat food, and drive 45 minutes home!

Hopefully that may help someone who is in the earlier stages. My advice would be - you know how your body feels, so don't push things too early; stack up lots of TV/films the first couple of weeks; when able to move more I found crafts and hobbies I usually don't have time for really made the time pass nicely (as it got a little lonely); if you can take the time off work - do it - although I'm lucky my employer is fantastic and occupational health have recommended I go back end June/July; if you're used to working out, definitely check out you tube chair workouts and the like as it helped me feel normal; I kept up my skincare regime and tried my best to make my bed daily - as it was form of self-care for me.

Chapter 1  
  
My mate cheated on me.  
  
On my birthday, Alice sent me a video—it showed a high-end bar where a man in a suit and mask was ""training"" a sexy woman dressed in a bunny outfit.  
  
The bunny girl had a seductive figure, wearing a ball gag, following his directions to perform one sultry pose after another.  
  
My blood ran cold instantly.  
  
After the video, a voice message popped up.  
  
""Elara, I know this isn't right, but I thought the dominant guy looked like your Alpha... Is he with you right now?""  
  
Alice was right. Even with the mask, I could recognize my mate...  
  
His magnetic voice came through our mindlink.: ""Ela, darling, I'm too busy to come home today. I've added you to my card—go buy yourself something nice.""  
  
His voice sounded languid, with a hint of breathlessness.  
  
""Is he mating with someone else?!""  
  
My wolf growled with fury.  
  
Our matebond began to ache.  
  
I tilted my head back, wiped away my tears, and called Ms. Mercer.  
  
""I'm willing to sever the mate bond with him, but all the conditions I proposed are non-negotiable.""  
  
The voice on the other end sounded excited, agreeing immediately: ""Done!""  
  
The next day.  
  
I stood outside his office.  
  
Just as I was about to knock, I detected an unusual scent.  
  
I took a deep breath, raised my hand, and knocked.  
  
""Come in,"" his magnetic voice came from inside.  
  
I gripped the documents in my hand tighter, placed my other hand on the doorknob, and as I entered, I put on a faint smile. I walked to his side and gently placed the documents in front of him.  
  
""Busy? These papers need your signature.""  
  
He signed his name hastily without even looking at them.  
  
Then he stood up and embraced me. ""Sorry, darling. I was on a business trip yesterday and couldn't celebrate your birthday. I noticed you didn't spend any money on the card. Nothing you liked? There's a new jeweled ring collection—I'll have Ronan send one over later.""  
  
I pushed him away subtly. ""No need.""  
  
I gathered the signed documents and asked one final question: ""Were you really on a business trip yesterday?""  
  
His expression didn't change at all. ""Of course. You can ask Ronan.""  
  
""Alright, I'll be going then.""  
  
I left with the documents, my smile already cold, transformed into a contemptuous sneer as I turned away.  
  
Just as I reached the door of his office's adjoining rest area, I heard a slight noise from inside, like a small creature jumping from the bed to the floor.  
  
I instinctively stopped, glanced sideways, and saw stockings scattered on the coffee table by the sofa, with a pink bra nearby. Clearly, they had been quite passionate.  
  
""She's still in there? Go in and tear her apart!""  
  
My wolf was furious, already trying to control my throat to emit a growl.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Back in my office, I nearly collapsed into my chair. My chest was filled with something—acid, grievance, humiliation—mixed with my wolf's rage, almost overwhelming me.  
  
I pulled out the thinnest document from the stack—the divorce agreement.  
  
I flipped to the last page, staring at that familiar yet pale handwriting, my finger gently tracing over the strokes. The same hand that once held mine and solemnly promised ""I will marry you"" had now decisively signed our divorce papers.  
  
His business trip was a lie; the affair was the truth. He even brought her to the company, into his office, making love right under my nose!  
  
And he still had the audacity to pretend to be nice to me. My stomach churned.  
  
I photographed the signature page and sent it to Mercer: ""He signed it.""  
  
This was the outcome we had already negotiated. She would provide a billion-dollar settlement, on the condition that I never revealed our secret marriage.  
  
I had one more requirement—she would help me leave completely, making it impossible for Rowan to ever find me again.  
  
""Knock, knock.""  
  
There was a knock at the door.  
  
I closed the divorce agreement. ""Come in.""  
  
It was his personal Beta, Ronan.  
  
He placed a dark green velvet jewelry box in front of me. ""This is from the Alpha for the Luna.""  
  
He still respectfully called me Luna, even though I was no longer Rowan's only one.  
  
I casually opened the box to find an expensive set of moonstone jewelry. At that moment, what flashed through my mind was the image of a girl in a half-wrapped bathrobe, proudly placing this necklace around her neck under ambient lighting, the kiss marks on her chest like a mockery.  
  
Nausea rose in my throat.  
  
""She's defiling our bed, Elara. We shouldn't forgive this.""  
  
Suppressing my wolf's anger, I looked up and smiled at Ronan.  
  
""Thank you, Beta.""  
  
Ronan tensed at my gaze.  
  
He awkwardly added: ""The Alpha personally selected this set. It's one of a kind, worldwide.""  
  
""Is that so? How thoughtful of him to remember to send me a gift despite his busy schedule. How touching.""  
  
Ronan's expression froze, clearly guessing something, and he quickly left the office.  
  
I swallowed my discomfort and took out my phone to call the werewolf orphanage directly.  
  
""Sell this jewelry set for me and buy food for the children.""  
  
At five in the afternoon.  
  
I walked to the underground parking garage. Just as I opened my car door, I looked up and saw that car not far away—Rowan's car.  
  
He sat in the back seat, and that girl... that girl with short hair, a round face, and youthful, almost flawless beauty, was leaning on his shoulder.  
  
Their scents intertwined, drifting through the car window gap. I stood motionless.  
  
""Alpha—!"" Ronan's alarmed cry came from inside the car, accompanied by a sudden brake.  
  
I finally looked up, and through the glass, Rowan and I locked eyes.  
  
Did he even remember who I was? His Luna.  
  
The wolf inside me growled softly, grief and anger intertwined.  
  
His eyes were ink-dark, as deep as the night sky before a storm.  
  
Mine were like dead water, completely still.  
  
The air in the garage seemed to solidify, each breath mixed with the scent of metal and desire.  
  
The girl saw me. But instead of restraining herself, she seemed to flaunt it, clinging to his neck even more brazenly, whispering something against his ear, her face full of triumphant satisfaction.  
  
My wolf howled inside, its claws repeatedly pounding against my ribcage: ""Tear her apart, Elara! She touched our mate—""  
  
""He's not ours anymore.""  
  
My eyes felt like they were burning. I lowered my head, turned around, got into my car, started the engine, and left in one fluid motion, without giving him another glance.  
  
My wolf churned inside my mind—anger, shame, abandonment—all washing over me at once. I could barely maintain control.  
  
When I got home, I didn't sit down but went straight to the closet.  
  
Before I could move, a wall of burning flesh pressed against me from behind.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
His scent swept over me like a tide, familiar yet repulsive. The Alpha's smell enveloped me completely—it was the mark we once shared in fusion, but now it nearly made me sick.  
  
""Are you angry?"" His voice was hoarse against my ear.  
  
I didn't look at him, just calmly put the necklace away, my tone cold: ""Angry enough to kill. You'd better be careful, or I might lose control.""  
  
He was silent for a moment. The air's scent became tense with our emotional clash, as if a single spark could ignite the entire space.  
  
""Ashenford pack wants to collaborate with us on the North Star project. Moira is their most beloved princess—this is a negotiation tactic.""  
  
""So?"" I slowly turned to face him. ""If you don't entertain his sister, he won't sign the contract?""  
  
His eyes suddenly went cold: ""Elara, I'm explaining to you. Don't be so passive-aggressive.""  
  
""Explaining?"" I laughed, cold as a knife. ""Rowan Mercer, if you're bored and want a new Luna, just say so. I don't have to keep this position.""  
  
His face instantly darkened: ""What did you say?""  
  
""I said—we can get divorced.""  
  
I pushed him away, preparing to leave. But he moved faster, suddenly grabbing me, his fingers digging into my chin with such force I could almost hear my bones creak.  
  
His Alpha aura fully released; the pressure of his dominant presence made even my wolf whimper submissively.  
  
""You'd better not even think about that.""  
  
""Not only is she thinking it, she's doing it. She doesn't love him anymore.""  
  
That night, he was called away by another phone call. I sat by the bed and heard a sweet female voice on the other end, crying and calling him coquettishly: ""Rowan...""  
  
The next morning, my friend and lawyer sent me a screenshot.  
  
Rowan's girlfriend had posted a selfie from the mountaintop last night. In the photo, a large hand and a small one formed a heart against the background of sunrise, with the caption: ""Feeling each other's heartbeats in the gentle embrace of dawn.""  
  
I immediately recognized his hand.  
  
I sat still, clutching my water glass for who knows how long, until my palm was cold and wet, my knuckles white.  
  
When I finally put the glass down, it hit the table with a sharp sound.  
  
It seemed... at that moment, a corner of my heart also broke.  
  
For several days after that, he didn't come home.  
  
We only saw each other once at a high-level meeting.  
  
He sat at the head, while I sat with other executives on either side. Throughout the meeting, he didn't say a word to me directly, nor did his eyes ever linger on me.  
  
I didn't go upstairs to find him.  
  
In my free time, I was busy looking at houses. I also cleared out all the gifts he'd given me over the years: anniversaries, birthdays, Valentine's Days, wedding anniversaries... I even sold my wedding ring.  
  
If I didn't want the person anymore, what was the point of keeping these things?  
  
We don't need mementos. We'll have a new den.  
  
My wolf muttered softly, surprisingly calm. I knew she'd had enough too.  
  
Late at night, Isabella—the owner of the private club ""Moon Dome""—sent me a message inviting me for a small gathering.  
  
Close to eleven, I had already changed into my nightgown, but thinking about how I'd need to rebuild my network after divorcing and leaving the Mercer pack, I ultimately chose an Armani haute couture suit and went out.  
  
As soon as my black Maybach stopped in front of the club's gilded doors, Isabella came out to meet me, walking on Jimmy Choo stilettos.  
  
""Darling, I'm so glad you could come."" She affectionately took my arm, a hint of Chanel No. 5 wafting past. ""Let me take you upstairs. The newly renovated VIP level can be confusing.""  
  
I smiled: ""Actually, a waiter could have shown me the way...""  
  
The mirrored elevator took us straight to the top floor, where she pushed open an ornately carved walnut door. A Venetian glass screen divided the private room into two sections. From the other side came the rich aroma of cigars and the sound of deep laughter. But Isabella only led me to a chair near the door.  
  
The woman sitting there looked somewhat familiar—I think she was the companion of one of Rowan's friends. She seemed to recognize me too, her expression a bit unnatural, though she still forced a smile and nodded.  
  
After Isabella left, I accepted a drink from a server and took a small sip, planning to rest a bit. But my thoughts were completely interrupted by voices from the other side of the glass door.  
  
""Speaking of which, Rowan doesn't bring Elara to gatherings anymore.""

1kxlr5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1kxlr5g/praying_for_my_husband_and_gods_working_on_me/,Praying for my husband and God’s working on me.,"Hello all, 

I just wanted to share my own little ray of hope that’s been shining through my marriage lately. God really does have a sense of humor. 

My husband and I have been married for almost 8 years. We’re both Christians, grew up and raised in faith-filled homes, etc.
However, I’m a lot firmer in my faith than he is. I think I just grew up more dependent on God. 

Earlier in the year I was feeling really resentful of how laxed my husband is towards his relationship with God. (But honestly, I don’t know what his relationship with God looks like and I haven’t really been able to coax it out of him.) I’ll bring up ideas on how we can strengthen our relationship with each other and with God together, but I don’t want to lead. (Please feel free to offer any advice). 

So I’ve been bringing it to God because there was just so much going on my life (mostly temptations) that I was feeling worse and worse in my marriage, with my husband specifically not seeking God and not leading our family. I was beginning to imagine myself falling into these temptations, but God very quickly allowed me to see and feel the damage that would follow if I did. It was a good “snap out of it,” God’s mercy really is more. Since my “snap out of it” encounter, I’ve been kind of unknowingly serving my husband all the more. God has lit this fire and desire in me to make him coffees and lunch for work in the mornings. I’m finding joy in keeping our house tidy for our kids and us to enjoy. He is an amazing husband and father and I’ve always known that, but lately I have just been so much more excited by him and all he does for me and us. 
Even though he isn’t leading our home in the Godly way I imagine, I know the Lord is working on him and me and that we’re not alone in this marriage. 

I just wanted share a “win” because I really was feeling so lost earlier this year and even though things are virtually the same the Lord has brought me through it and I’m JOYFUL!!!

What do I do?,"I (M29) met someone (M29) through a dating app two years ago. I didn't intend to go for anything serious with him. It was supposed to be a one coffee date and then that was it. Just to make the date a tad more fun for myself, I faked my past about where I came from and stuff about my family. Then we didn't have a romantic relationship but we became really good buddies. He is one of my best friends now.

For the past two years, he introduced me to a lot of his friends to me and his friends introduced to a few people to me. Because I lied to him on our first date, I had to stick with that ""persona"" with all the other people. It never felt like the right time to be honest about it. But now I feel too tired to carry on this persona.

Or a few months ago a relative of mine passed away and I needed someone to join me to drive to the funeral, but I couldn't ask anyone because none of my relatives was supposed to be here, or if they had met my family, they would have known all the lies I've told for the last two years.

I don't want to lie to them anymore. Sometimes I have nightmares where all my lies are exposed and I feel too ashamed. But I can't fix it now.

She still lives with her parents. I do work and Im more financially stable. I have my own place and she is pretty much over on weekends and sometimes even on weekdays. The only reason she has not moved in with me yet is because i just got promoted to a new role and im waiting for my orientation period to be completed at work so that i feel more comfortable. I pay for the rent and basically for everything including dates and food. Additionally I send her about $240 a month to help her whenever she wants to buy some small things for herself like coffee or snacks between classes. Additionally part of this helps cover one of her monthly dental bills as she recently had to have a root canal. Despite all of this sometimes i feel inadequate as a boyfriend because i can tell there are times where she is running low on funds and is too embarrassed to ask me for more money. Im considering just giving her access to my bank account and telling her to use it if she needs something. I just want her to feel supported. But maybe this may backfire?

**Trigger warning:** Self-harm, suicidal thoughts, Depression and mental illness, mention of trauma and emotional abuse, bullying & explicit language

I better hurry—I got work tomorrow. But I really hate this. This fucking sucks. It’s so miserable it almost becomes funny again. Actually, I’m laughing. Like a maniac. Not a cute giggle, but a hysterical, crying laugh.

How the fuck did I end up on this bathroom floor, bleeding all over the place, laughing the last breath out of my lungs?

When I was 4 I asked myself why humanity was so incompetent. They lie and kill and rob, yet they want to sleep in their warm beds, fed and safe. Why do they say it’s for the best? What the fuck does “the greater good” even mean?

At the ripe age of 6, I first thought of death as a pleasant break, rather than an untimely end. At 13, I held a gun up to my head and pulled the trigger. It was empty.

Flash forward to 15. THERAPY. Not bad but not great either. Many years of self-harm and talking to a very nice but strange lady, I finally understood that I, in fact, am not suicidal. I don’t actually want to die. I just want to never ever even have existed in the first place. If it were possible to erase my existence, I would. Immediately.

I was 20 years old when I finally finished the horrors called school. I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I should go next. I applied to many jobs, but of course, none of them worked out.

After months of depression and anxiety, I was desperate. I took a simple job. 4–6 hours of sorting mail. At 4:30 in the morning.

It was absolutely destroying what little mental health I had left, but I needed money. Badly.

I had started losing my mind much earlier though. Maybe when I was 4 or 6.

Maybe I killed my brain with imaginary bullets. Maybe I bled out all my strength or starved away my will to live. Maybe it was all the shitty TV shows or getting slapped by my mom. Maybe getting bullied did the trick? Or maybe it’s just fucking destiny.

All I know for sure is that after the first week of work, I knew it was over. I flipped a switch. I turned it off. Myself, that is.

No more thinking. No more feeling. Just getting up. Going to work. Smoking a cigarette. Going home. Eating. Sleeping. Repeat.

I just remember seeing numbers. I remember hearing a distant voice, but I forgot what she said. I don’t remember faces or names. I actually don’t remember anything. All I told you before is what I have been memorizing for my goodbye letter. I could talk about that in my sleep. Maybe I do.

Regardless, one day I just woke up staring out my window. I saw something so beautifully bright I wanted to kill it. It was a single star out in the sky. Had it always been there? Impossible. I would have seen it. It’s unbearably bright. Turn it off. It is aggravating me. Why is it bothering me so much? I keep looking at it. I stare. I stare until I can’t see it anymore.

And at that moment, I started to feel again. This feeling, if I remember correctly, is called anger. But words cannot describe what I truly felt on that early morning. Rage filled my bones. My eyes were burning. My mind was screaming. My entire body was ready for war.

That’s what the world was asking for, wasn’t it? Lies. Deceit. Fear. Anger. Hunger. Lust. Selfishness. Humans are rotten. Children are born out of the will to be more than what one is. Pets are kept to hide from the truth that humans don’t deserve to be loved. Love is a foolish concept. Humanity is an imaginary term. We are nothing but mere animals with a few too many brain cells and a mutation we call emotions.

And that star, that one stupid sun somewhere out there, light-years away, reminded me of that. Yes, I remembered it all. The pain in my cheeks and the redness after being slapped. The words my bullies spat so hatefully at me. The eyes of those who watched and giggled. The cries I heard in my dreams. The tightness in my chest after the teacher told me that I was fat. The itch in my hands when I held that gun. The twitching in my left eye when I held the knife. My grin when I finally understood that a life can be ended quicker than it can be given. I remembered.

And that day, I wanted everyone else to remember too.

The coffee tasted horrible. The bread was disgusting. The air smelled foul. It was a cold winter morning. The stars were my only light, and the drive went by in a blink.

I arrived without a single good morning. No smile or wave. I stared in the distance as I started my work. The mail felt heavy, much like my breathing.

Then I realized something. My vision got blurry, my heart rate increased. It didn’t seem like the typical panic attack, so what was it now? A heart attack maybe? My chest did hurt like shit. I looked around, and the room was spinning. I was laughing, I think.

The routine kicked in. I had done this a million times before. Lock yourself in the bathroom. Back against the wall. Slide down. Breathe. Count your fingers. Are they all still there? Great. Look at all kinds of stuff to stay distracted and calm your breathing. That is some beautiful woodchip wallpaper alright.

After calming down, I went for my desperately needed smoke break. This might be the day, I thought. My last day in existence. The last time I have to endure the stupidity of humanity.

But no, I just zoned out while fantasizing about how I would change the world. How I would make them see and understand. How I would finally be okay.

Before I even knew it, everyone had already left. I was the last one here. I don’t remember clocking out or driving home. What I do remember is looking in the mirror and staring into my own soul. Or the lack thereof.

The abyss that was my pupil seemed endless. I got lost in it for too long. I saw myself, back when I was a kid. The first time my mother’s hand destroyed my dreams. The red handprint on my burning cheek. A tear running down and a face that seemed to ask “Why?”

I opened the drawer, containing my “souvenirs”. Glass shards. They reminded me of myself. They looked so pretty in the right light. I chose the smallest one, a greenish shard of an old bottle. I gripped it firmly in my right hand.

One fine line.

Two fine lines.

The most beautiful ink started to drip down my arm. It looked so pure. So fresh. Not rotten or broken, not sad or mean. It looked so peaceful, dripping down to the floor.

Remember the routine. Back against the wall. Slide down. Count the lines. Look how pretty the shard looks.

A life can end so easily. One hit to the head. A bullet to the heart. A deep cut. A rope. One jump. Stairs could do the trick. Or a bottle of pills? Maybe a long bath.

Or maybe I just sit here and wait.

It’ll be fine.

It’s going to be okay.

Tomorrow will be another day.

Just take a nap.

These pills will help.

Have you tried yoga?

Maybe you should call your therapist again.

I heard eating ginger helps.

Oh.

Well, this is rather unpleasant.

I didn’t cut deep enough. Again.

I made a mess.

I’ll have to clean this up.

Where did I put those new bandages?

Okay, I am 23 and still living at home hence my expenses are quite low so I do not pay for groceries. I am saving up to move out in maybe a year or two. The only “credit” that I have is from my student loans and I am wanting to get a credit card to build some credit.

I am interested in the Capital One Savor card but I do not eat out THAT often, maybe once a week. I don’t get coffee or fast food, just the occasional restaurant once a week. One of benefits of the card look very restaurant focused so I don’t know if it would be a good one for me since I don’t eat out often nor do I grocery shop myself (yet, I know I will eventually). 

I am also not a big traveler just because I am broke. I take one vacation a year that is usually just a long weekend, not a week or anything. In my future maybe I would take more?? 

I spend the most amount of money on just things like weird items and collectibles and my hobbies and the occasional concert. So a card that is like 2-3% on everything if that exists may be better for me as it covers a lot of bases but nothing super specific, but I don’t have enough credit probably to be approved for it.

So this is completely insane and I'm still processing everything that happened. My life went from normal suburban mom to absolute chaos in the span of six months and I honestly don't know if I'm the villain here or just someone who made terrible decisions when everything fell apart.

Last spring my husband got pulled over for speeding on his way home from work. Nothing major, just going 15 over on the highway. The officer who stopped him was this guy in his early thirties, really professional, kind of had that confident cop thing going on. My husband came home ranting about getting a ticket and how the cop was ""probably on some power trip"" but I didn't think much of it.

Two weeks later I'm at the grocery store and I see the same officer in line behind me. He recognized me somehow, maybe from pictures in my husband's wallet or something, and struck up a conversation. Asked how my husband was doing with the ticket, made some joke about how he hoped there were no hard feelings. I laughed it off and we ended up talking for like twenty minutes in the parking lot.

Here's where it gets complicated. My marriage had been pretty rocky for about two years. My husband worked constantly, we barely talked anymore, and I felt like I was just going through the motions. This officer, let's call him Mike, was actually listening to me talk about my kids, asking about my job, being genuinely interested in what I had to say. It felt like I hadn't had a real conversation with an adult in months.

Mike started showing up at places I went. The coffee shop near my work, the park where I took my kids, always with some excuse about being in the neighborhood. I knew what was happening but I didn't stop it. The attention felt amazing after feeling invisible in my own house for so long.

The first time we kissed was in his patrol car after he ""happened"" to see me leaving the gym. I felt terrible but also more alive than I had in years. We started meeting regularly, always during his shifts, always in his car or some secluded spot. The whole thing felt dangerous and exciting and completely unlike anything I'd ever done.

After about three months of this affair, my husband got arrested. Mike called it in as a domestic disturbance after a neighbor complained about shouting from our house. The thing is, we weren't even fighting that night. My husband was just frustrated about work and raised his voice while on a phone call with his boss. But Mike showed up, said he smelled alcohol, which was a lie, and arrested him for drunk and disorderly conduct.

My husband spent the night in jail and came home the next day furious and confused. He kept saying something felt off about the whole thing, that the cop seemed to have it out for him. I played dumb and comforted him, all while texting Mike about when we could see each other next.

The arrest gave Mike access to all kinds of information about our household. He knew my husband's work schedule, when he traveled for business, everything. He started getting bolder, sometimes coming over when my husband was at work, always in uniform, always with some excuse about following up on the arrest or checking on neighborhood security.

My husband became paranoid after the arrest. He was convinced someone was watching the house, that his phone calls were being monitored, that he was being followed. I kept telling him he was being crazy, but honestly, Mike was doing exactly those things. He'd drive by our house multiple times during his shifts, he had run background checks on my husband's friends and coworkers, he even pulled over my husband's brother once for no reason.

The breaking point came when my husband lost his job. Mike had been calling his workplace anonymously, reporting that they employed someone with a criminal record who might be unstable. My husband couldn't prove it, but he suspected the harassment was connected to his arrest. He started drinking more, became increasingly angry and suspicious, and our marriage completely fell apart.

During all of this, Mike was talking about our future together. He had excellent benefits through the police department, a pension plan, job security. He painted this picture of the stable life we could have together if I just divorced my husband. The problem was, divorce would mean splitting assets, paying lawyers, disrupting my kids' lives.

So Mike came up with this plan. We would get married quietly at the courthouse, I'd get on his insurance and benefit plans, but I wouldn't tell my husband right away. I could keep living in the house, maintain stability for my kids, and slowly transition out of my marriage when the timing was better.

I know how this sounds. I know exactly how messed up this is. But I was so deep in this situation and Mike made it seem like the most logical solution. He said lots of couples have unconventional arrangements, that we were just being practical about a complicated situation.

So we did it. Got married on a Tuesday afternoon with two strangers as witnesses. I wore a dress I bought at Target that morning. Mike wore his uniform because he was on duty and had to get back to patrol. The whole thing took fifteen minutes and felt completely surreal.

Going home to my husband that night was one of the hardest things I've ever done. He had no idea I'd just married another man. He made dinner, helped our kids with homework, complained about his job search, all while I sat there wearing another man's ring hidden under my wedding band.

This went on for two months. I was legally married to Mike but still living with my husband like nothing had changed. Mike would come over during the day when he could, always careful about the neighbors, always in and out quickly. My husband was still dealing with the fallout from losing his job and had no idea his wife was married to the cop who destroyed his life.

The whole thing unraveled when my husband found paperwork from Mike's insurance company in my car. He confronted me and I broke down and told him everything. The affair, the marriage, Mike's role in his arrest and job loss, all of it.

My husband didn't scream or throw things like I expected. He just looked at me like I was a complete stranger and said, ""You married the man who ruined my life and you've been living here like nothing happened. Do you understand how sick that is?""

He moved out that same day. Stayed at his brother's place and filed for divorce immediately. Mike was thrilled because now we could be together openly, but I felt horrible about how everything went down.

The worst part is my kids. They loved their dad and now they barely see him because he can't afford his own place and child support. They ask me why daddy doesn't live here anymore and I don't know how to explain that mommy destroyed everything.

Mike acts like we're this perfect couple now, but I'm starting to see him differently. The way he manipulated the situation with my husband, how he abused his position as a police officer, the fact that he seems proud of what he did rather than guilty. Sometimes he talks about other people in town like they're beneath him, refers to civilians in this dismissive way that makes my skin crawl.

I'm realizing that I'm trapped in this new marriage with someone who might be genuinely dangerous. If I try to leave him, he knows where I live, he has access to police resources, he could make my life hell the same way he did to my husband. Plus I signed up for all these benefits through his job, so leaving would mean financial disaster.

My family won't speak to me. My former friends think I'm horrible. My ex-husband tells our kids that mommy made some very bad choices and they'll understand when they're older. The only person in my corner is Mike, and I'm starting to understand that might not be a good thing.

The thing that keeps me up at night is wondering if Mike targeted my family from the beginning. Did he really just happen to recognize me at the grocery store, or had he been planning this whole thing since that first traffic stop? Was I an easy mark because of my unhappy marriage, or did he somehow engineer my marriage problems too?

I destroyed my family, ruined my ex-husband's life, and married a man who might be a sociopath, all because I was lonely and wanted attention. My kids are going to need therapy, my ex-husband is still struggling to rebuild his career, and I'm stuck in this marriage that feels more like a prison every day.

So reddit, am I the asshole here? Because honestly, I'm starting to think I might be the victim too, but everyone in my life seems to think I'm just a selfish cheater who got what she deserved. How do you even come back from something like this?",2,1748449457.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

Short Bible Study with me about Matthew 26:26

Introduction
------------

In the busyness of life, we often forget to pause and reflect on the deeper meanings and spiritual truths found in the Bible. Today, we’ll embark on a journey into Matthew 26:26, exploring the profound significance of this verse. Whether you’re sipping your morning coffee or winding down your day, take a moment to connect with the wisdom that has guided countless generations before us.

The Bible is more than just a book; it’s a living testimony of faith, hope, and love. As we delve into the teachings of Jesus, we open our hearts to transformative insights that fuel our spiritual growth. Let this study inspire and uplift you, encouraging you to embrace the power of faith in your everyday life.

Bible Verse
-----------

“While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ‘Take and eat; this is my body.'” — Matthew 26:26 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Matthew 26:26 captures a pivotal moment during the Last Supper when Jesus instituted the sacrament of communion. As Jesus breaks the bread and offers it to his disciples, He symbolizes the offering of His own life for the salvation of humanity. This gesture embodies grace, sacrifice, and divine love.

The act of breaking bread signifies more than a meal; it represents unity and community. Jesus invites us to partake in this sacrament, reminding us of the profound connection we share with Him and with each other as believers. Through the breaking of bread, we remember the sacrifice Jesus made and the new covenant it established.

This verse calls us to reflect on our spiritual nourishment. Just as bread sustains our bodies, Jesus sustains our souls. When we partake in communion, we recommit ourselves to living a life that reflects His teachings and love.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Participate in a communion service at your local church to deepen your understanding and connection with this sacrament.

– Reflect on the ways you can embody Jesus’ love and sacrifice in your daily interactions with others.

– Create a gratitude journal specifically for reflecting on your spiritual journey and the blessings in your life.

– Share a meal with friends or family, using the time to discuss and reflect on your faith journey together.

– Commit to regular Bible study to continually nourish your spirit and grow in understanding.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. How does the act of communion enhance your personal relationship with Jesus?

2. In what ways can you offer love and sacrifice to those around you?

3. What does spiritual nourishment mean to you, and how do you seek it in your life?

4. Reflect on a time when you felt particularly connected to your faith.

5. How can you foster a sense of community and unity within your own life?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of Your love and sacrifice. Help me to understand the depth of Your grace and to live a life that reflects Your teachings. May I always remember the significance of communion and find ways to emulate Your love and generosity in my daily interactions. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

Conclusion
----------

As we conclude this study on Matthew 26:26, let’s carry the lessons of communion, sacrifice, and grace into our daily lives. Each time we gather with loved ones or partake in the Lord’s Supper, we have an opportunity to deepen our faith and strengthen our community.

I (26F) met Donny (30M) on Bumble a few months ago, and things moved fast — mostly because he was the one pushing for it.

Our first date was dinner and a spontaneous comedy show. It was fun, but I was still keeping my options open.

Second date, he made me steak and potatoes at his place and then took me to a live music event. He later told me he had *never* made anyone dinner on a second date before and called it the best date of his life. At the time, I wasn’t feeling a strong physical connection, and I considered backing off, but we kept texting daily. He was away for work, and I was on a trip, so we didn’t see each other again for almost a month.

On our third date, he wanted to take me to a fancy dinner for my (late) birthday, but I said that was too much, so we kept it casual. I ended up spending the night for the first time, and something shifted. He was coming across as emotionally available and genuinely interested in me. My feelings started to change.

A few days later, we met for coffee, and he told me he wanted us to be exclusive. That was technically only our fourth date. I told him I wasn’t ready yet but wanted to keep seeing him and see where it went. He said he was fine with that and willing to wait.

Throughout April, we kept getting closer. I stopped seeing the only other person I’d been dating casually and focused on Donny. He made significantly more money than me and would regularly pay for meals, drinks, Ubers, etc., which I appreciated. He kept making comments about wanting a relationship but always said he understood that I needed to take things slow. I had been burned before and was trying not to rush anything.

At the end of April, I felt ready, and we made things official. We were boyfriend and girlfriend.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my graduation family dinner. I even told him he didn’t have to come — he insisted on joining. He met my whole family. It seemed to go well.

After making things official, I started noticing things that gave me pause. I began to feel unheard, talked over, and generally dismissed. He made comments like “I like to spend money like an asshole.” He would throw away six to eight plastic water bottles a day without recycling. He often spoke poorly about friends he claimed were close. His entire lifestyle seemed focused on maximizing convenience — and that started to show in how he handled the relationship too. I was commuting two hours from outside the city to see him (and for work/friends), and he never once came to me.

Then, completely out of nowhere, he sent me a text saying my *hygiene habits* were a “showstopper” for him, and he was feeling “overwhelmed by the pace” of our relationship and wanted to take a step back.

This was confusing on multiple levels.

1. **He set the pace.** He was the one who pushed for exclusivity, pushed for official status, gave me a key to his apartment, invited me to a wedding at the end of the year, and made future plans.
2. **I gave him outs.** When I stayed over three nights in a row (which was a first), I told him I could stay with a friend one night — he told me not to. When I invited him to my family dinner, I said he didn’t have to come — he insisted.
3. **The “hygiene” thing came out of nowhere.** For context: he showers and uses mouthwash multiple times a day. I typically shower every other day (but also sometimes daily) and have never in my life once been told I smell, have bad breath, or am unhygienic. He had bought mouthwash for me to keep at his place, and I thought it was a sweet gesture at the time — not a sign of judgment.

After he sent the breakup text, I called him, and we talked for 30 minutes. He said his “OCD” made my hygiene habits difficult for him. He also said, “I know I’m very difficult to be with” and admitted the breakup was “90% his fault.”

A week before all this, I had met his parents. We had made future plans. I was starting to settle into the relationship. I thought he was genuine when he told me I deserved to be treated well and that he could see I hadn’t been in the past.

Now, looking back, all those words feel empty. It feels like the rug was pulled out from under me.

I’ve never felt so confused and caught off guard. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

**TL;DR:**  
Started dating someone who pushed for commitment early, gave me a key, met my family, and said all the right things. A month into being official, he dumped me via text over my “hygiene” (despite them falling well within normal habits). He later admitted he has ""OCD"" and said it was mostly his fault. For reference, I am a mental health therapist and know he does not have clinical OCD. Feeling incredibly blindsided and hurt.",2,1748448998.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.75,False
