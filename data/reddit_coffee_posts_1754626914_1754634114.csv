1mknovp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mknovp/why_am_i_all_of_a_sudden_reacting_badly_to_a/,Why am I all of a sudden reacting badly to a drink I used to really enjoy?,"Hi all! Sorry for the silly question 
I am 26 years old, female, 5'8, and 125lb. 

 I've never reacted super well to caffeine (I don't drink coffee) but I've always tolerated matcha well. However these past two times I've had it I've not felt well after taking it.  First time about an hour after I drank it I felt really nauseous and had a bit of a racing heart. This second time I tried a new shop and within 45 minutes of drinking it I got super super nauseous,  and my heart started racing and I had awful tremors. I felt awful. I freaked out and went to the ER because it wouldn't go away and they ran several labs, did a few ekgs. I felt better after a few hours. The doctor later told me he didn't see anything dangerous. He asked me what I was doing when this started happening and I told him he said that I was probably reacting badly to the caffeine in the powder? And to follow up with my PCP if symptoms persist 
Can one develop a sensitivity to something previous enjoyed? Thank you! ",1,1754633996.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m Darv / Marvin — a French teacher and passionate gamer. As part of a professional project, I’m currently looking for 5 to 10 fellow gamers who are learning French to answer a few questions about their experience.  
I want to better understand your challenges and needs as a learner and as a gamer. I’ve learned several languages myself thanks to video games, and now I’d love to design a teaching method that uses games the way we do — but to do that, I need your input ☺️.  
The interview takes about 10–15 minutes.  
This is totally FREE. It is just a friendly chat to get to know your experience better.  
As a thank you, you’ll receive a vocabulary list with key words used in French gaming, plus an audio version to help with pronunciation — useful whether you play solo or in multiplayer sessions 😁.  
If that sounds interesting and you’d like to help me out, send me a DM (or answer here and I’ll DM you) and I’ll share a link to book a quick call at your convenience. We’ll grab a virtual coffee or tea and talk about gaming and learning.

1mknl8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mknl8e/we_were_never_together_but_its_always_been_her/,"We were never together, but it’s always been her.","We met in college when we were both 19. Same elective class. She was the kind of person who always brought snacks to class and offered them to everyone, even the professor. I sat next to her once and made some dumb joke about how I only took the class for easy credits, and she laughed a little too hard. That’s how it started.

We became good friends. Study partners, then late-night call kind of friends. The kind where you end up talking about everything except the class you’re supposed to be doing.

She had a boyfriend the whole time. A decent guy, honestly. And I was dating someone too, off and on. But the thing is, with her, there was always this... I don’t know—charge. We never crossed any lines, but sometimes it felt like we were right on the edge.

One night, we were sitting on the grass outside the library after pulling an all-nighter. She was half-asleep, staring at the sky, and just said, “If things were different, do you think we’d be together?” I didn’t say anything. I wanted to say yes. But I didn’t want to mess up whatever it was we had. So I said something dumb like, “Maybe in another life.”

She graduated a year before me and moved cities. We stayed in touch—birthdays, random memes, the occasional “Hey, heard this song and thought of you.” That kind of thing.

Over the years, we both had relationships. I was in one for three years. Almost proposed, didn’t. She was in a serious one too. Then she moved again—this time out of the country. I honestly thought that was it. That we’d just fade out like most people do.

But earlier this year, I saw her post on Instagram—back in town. I didn’t think much of it. Then one day, I was walking into this random art café, and there she was. Sitting by the window, sipping coffee and sketching. She looked up and just smiled like no time had passed. It messed me up.

We talked for four hours. About everything. It felt like picking up a book you never finished, and every word still made sense. She had just gotten out of a long-term thing. I was single too.

No one said anything about “us.” We just talked.

But a week later, she texted me at midnight:

“I don’t want to do the what-ifs anymore.”



We met again the next day. We talked about all the years. The people in between. The times we could’ve been something but never were. And then she just said, “So can we finally see what this actually is?”

We’re not rushing it. No labels yet. Just… trying. But for the first time in a long time, it feels like the timing is finally not working against us.

All those years of almost.
Now we’re finally a maybe.

1mknkgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mknkgc/aitah_for_holding_heavy_grudges/,AITAH for holding heavy grudges,"Hello. I am 13m, and I would like to make something clear: I have never really had a good male figure in my life. My father divorced my mom after cheating on her with a woman 12 years younger, and then married her after. I was 3. Then, my step-father was an abusive red neck (sorta) who was rude, aggressive, and just an asshole. He would get really aggressive during what was similar to 'episodes'. He also had us doing daily extensive yard work, pushing us over the top, I was 7-11. Then there is my older brother, or really all my siblings. My dad pitted us all against each other, making us compete for his attention and approval. This made all of my siblings hate especially me, cause I was the least favorite to my father. I never really cared for his approval, which made my sibling upset at me. This post will primarily be centered around my old step father, though my dad has some crazy stories (he should be in jail).

My step father was crazy. At first he was fine, but over time he became a center to my life for some reason. He moved in, we moved to a bigger house, etc. He relied off of all of my moms money, and would waste pretty much all of it (my father did the exact thing). He also was all pretend, but only to my mom and grandma. He hit us when we couldn't do something, find something, or even just say something he didn't agree to. He also abused our dogs, extensively, for no reason. I never really liked him, really ever. Everyone in my family claimed to but to be honest, I'm almost 100% it was a lie, and my family did the same with my dad. I remember in my old house, he once pushed my brother against a wall, pinning him by his neck, and yelling at him (yet people wonder why I never liked him). He was judgmental and rude. I am gay, and he put me through that damn ringer. There are so many things he did to me, my mom, etc. I remember at \~9 I found my mom crying after him yelling at her, and I tried (but failed since I was so young) at comforting her. His last main freak out was me and my mom telling him something he did wrong, I'm pretty sure at least. After we did, he threw a mug of coffee on the floor, shattering it, and went around the house my mom and only my mom pays for.

Anyway, jump to me waking up at like 11-12, and walking to my moms room. While on the way, I saw my old step father on the bathroom floor, looking like he was sleeping with no snoring. I woke up my mom, thinking it was funny cause I was genuinely unaware of the truth : he was having a stroke. He started to throw up white foam, shaking etc. Anyway, he was in the hospital, went back to his original state, and I thought it was over. He lived, I saved his life, yay I guess. BUT my mom kept talking to him. And slowly talk about him, more and more. They became friends again and then he came to my house once more. My mom promised it was just a platonic relationship, and she did view it so, but he didn't. He still wants a relationship, texts her sexually, etc. He does act somewhat differently now, a bit nicer, but he still can not take criticism and is just an asshole still. Everyone forgives him apparently, and I don't. I avoid him, am snarky to him, and just don't like him. So, AITAH?

==================================================

**OPENING**

\[Theme music plays, black-and-white “UNHhhh” title card. Cut to Trixie and Katya in mismatched chairs, drinking iced coffee out of suspicious mason jars.\]

TRIXIE: “Hi, I’m Trixie Mattel, the only drag queen who thinks Alexa is her real mother.”

KATYA: “And I’m Katya, the Soviet-era toaster oven that came to life after a lightning storm and now haunts a Waffle House in Tallahassee.”

TRIXIE: “And Welcome to..."" 

BOTH: ""UNHhhh!""

TRIXIE (pointing at camera): “The show where we talk about whatever we want.”

KATYA (robot voice): “Because it’s our show…”

BOTH: “…and not yours.”

\[Smash cut to Katya licking a 9-volt battery for no reason.\]



TRIXIE: “Today we’re talking about robots, AI, and how soon they’re going to replace you… unless you’re already useless, in which case—beat ‘em to it.”



**SCENE 1 – THE ROBOT TAKEOVER**

TRIXIE: “Robots are getting better and better, and soon they’ll take over people’s jobs.”

KATYA: “Finally! I’m tired of pretending I like customer service.”

TRIXIE: “Imagine—no more baristas spelling your name wrong.”

KATYA: “Just a sleek titanium beauty handing you your latte, with a voice like Siri if she smoked Virginia Slims.”

TRIXIE: “And instead of judging you, she just scans your face and goes, ‘Ooh… rough night, babe.’”

KATYA: “And then she tips herself.”

Jump cut to Trixie sipping coffee, looking horrified.

TRIXIE: “She’s unionized.”

  
**SCENE 2 – WHICH JOBS GO FIRST?**

KATYA: “First they came for the factory workers, and I said nothing—because I was busy watching a Roomba drag my lace fronts around the living room.”

TRIXIE: “Then they came for the lawyers, the accountants, the baristas…”

KATYA: “And then they came for the drag queens. Which… good luck, sweetie.”

Jump cut to Katya in full mime makeup, staring directly at the camera for way too long.



**SCENE 3 – ARE WE SAFE?**

TRIXIE: “Are *our* jobs safe?”

KATYA: “Yes. No robot can do what we do—”

TRIXIE: “Sit in wigs and scream at each other?”

KATYA: “Correct. And you can’t program flop sweat.”

TRIXIE: “You can, but it’s called ‘Windows Vista.’”



**SCENE 3.5 – THE LIVE ROBOT DEMO**

TRIXIE: “Speaking of… we actually have a special guest today. Ladies, gentlemen, and firmware updates—meet RANDY: the Robotic Artificial Neural Drag Yenta.”

Camera pans to RANDY. She is exactly as described: busted silver face, bright blush smeared like a crime scene, curly wig that looks like it came free with a parade float.

KATYA (physically recoils): “Oh… she’s giving Terminator 2: Judgment Gay.”

ROBOT R.A.N.D.Y. (monotone): “Hello carbon-based lifeforms. I am here to replace you.”

TRIXIE: “Girl, replace the blush first.”

KATYA: “That’s not blush—that’s a Chernobyl sunburn.”

ROBOT: “Correction: My contour is flawless.”

TRIXIE: “Your contour looks like you lost a fistfight with a cherry popsicle.”

Jump cut to close-up of RANDY’s crooked lashes twitching.

KATYA: “RANDY, can you do a death drop?”

ROBOT: “Initiating death drop sequence in three… two—” \[Suddenly seizes up, falls face-first onto the studio floor with a hollow metal thud.\]

TRIXIE (leaning over): “She’s serving face… down.”

KATYA (without looking): “Girl, call Geek Squad.”

ROBOT (on floor, voice glitching): “Error: Cannot find human relevance. Recommend: retirement.”

Jump cut to Katya sipping from a Capri Sun.

KATYA: “She’s right. I’m quitting.”



**SCENE 4 – THE “ROBOT DRAG RACE” FUTURE**

TRIXIE: “Picture it: Drag Race Season 37—RoboDrag Edition. Contestants? A blender in a corset, a toaster with contour, and a sex robot named Chastity.exe.”

KATYA: “The lip sync is just two Roombas spinning until one tips over.”

TRIXIE: “And RuPaul uploads her consciousness into a drone and just hovers ominously over the runway.”

Jump cut to Trixie holding a salad spinner and whispering, “Category is… spin cycle.”



**SCENE 5 – WHAT ROBOTS CAN’T DO**

KATYA: “Robots can’t bomb on stage and then pretend it was performance art.”

TRIXIE: “They can’t black out mid-number and wake up with $200 in tips and a new tattoo.”

KATYA: “They can’t smell fear—and fear is *my* brand.”



**SCENE 6 – CLOSING BIT**

TRIXIE: “So… should we be scared?”

KATYA: “Yes.”

TRIXIE: “Will robots take our jobs?”

KATYA: “Only if they can figure out how to glue down a lace front with Elmer’s and shame.”

TRIXIE (into camera): “And until then…”

BOTH: “…the future is stupid.”

1mknjau,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1mknjau/ranking_the_best_beachfront_airbnbs_in_san_diego/,Ranking the Best Beachfront Airbnbs in San Diego: Top 10 Views,"# San Diego's Best Beachfront Airbnbs: Where Ocean Views Meet Vacation Dreams 🌊🏖️

Hey Travel Trotters! Just got back from an epic San Diego trip and I'm still dreaming about the sound of waves crashing outside my window every morning. For those planning a SoCal adventure, I've compiled the ultimate guide to beachfront stays that'll make your Instagram followers green with envy!

San Diego's 70 miles of coastline offers something for every type of beach lover, and I personally visited and vetted these spots for our community. Let's dive in!

## Mission Bay Magic 🏄‍♀️

The Bayside Retreat in Mission Bay absolutely blew me away! Waking up to 180-degree views of Sail Bay from a private rooftop deck feels like something out of a movie. The guesthouse comfortably fits four people, and having direct beach access meant we could go from bed to beach in literally 30 seconds.

Pro tip: Bring your paddleboard or rent one nearby - the calm bay waters are perfect for beginners!

Another Mission Bay gem is the pet-friendly Bayfront with Large Private Patio. My golden retriever Thor was in absolute heaven! The serene views and spacious patio became our favorite spot for morning coffee and sunset drinks. The rental owners even left treats for Thor - talk about hospitality! 🐾

## Ocean Beach Vibes 🌅

For couples, the Ocean Beach Surfside Cottage 17 offers that cozy, romantic atmosphere that larger rentals just can't match. Opening the back door to find yourself on a cliff overlooking the pier is absolutely magical. We spent hours watching surfers catch waves below while sipping local craft beers.

The neighborhood has this laid-back, slightly hippie vibe that feels worlds away from downtown San Diego, though it's only a short drive. Wednesday farmers market here is a MUST - some of the best street food I've encountered in my travels!

## Boardwalk Beauty 🛹

The Boardwalk Stay with Shared Hot Tub and Patio puts you right in the center of beachfront action. We loved people-watching from the patio while enjoying morning bagels. The West Coast sunsets from this spot are UNREAL - I got my best vacation photos here!

Having two bedrooms made this perfect for our small group, and the shared hot tub became our nightly ritual after long days of exploring. The owners provided beach chairs and umbrellas, saving us rental fees.

## Modern Luxury 🔥

If you're willing to splurge a bit, the Rooftop Beach Views – Liquid Blue 2 is worth every penny. This ultramodern condo screams luxury with its sleek design and tech amenities. The rooftop deck with fire pit became our favorite spot - imagine roasting marshmallows while watching the sunset over the Pacific! 

We met some neighbors who've been returning to this building for years, which speaks volumes about the quality of the stay.

## Mission Beach Treasures 💎

The Mission Beach Ocean Front 2 Bedroom offers that rare combo of bay and ocean views. Waking up in the California King bed with the ocean literally outside your window? Priceless! The location is perfect for those who want to be near attractions but not overwhelmed by tourists.

Nearby, the Ocean View with Massive Private Deck near Belmont Park gave us the best of both worlds. The garage was clutch for parking (which can be a nightmare in beach areas), and grilling fresh seafood from the nearby market while overlooking the ocean was a highlight of our trip.

## Capri by the Sea Luxury 🌟

For those seeking resort-like amenities with the privacy of an Airbnb, the Capri Coastal Haven and Beach Front Condo in the Capri by the Sea complex deliver big time. The spa, sauna, and pool access meant we could alternate between ocean swims and pool lounging.

The floor-to-ceiling windows in both units frame the Pacific like living artwork. We stayed in the remodeled condo and appreciated the modern kitchen for preparing fresh local seafood dinners.

## Why Choose Beachfront in San Diego? 🤔

After staying inland on previous trips, I can confidently say beachfront is 100% worth the splurge. Here's why:

1. The constant soundtrack of waves is scientifically proven to reduce stress (I slept better than I have in months!)
2. Sunrise beach walks before the crowds arrive = pure magic
3. No parking hassles during peak beach times
4. Midday breaks from sightseeing are easy when ""home"" is right on the sand
5. The temperature near the ocean stays more moderate (we barely needed AC!)

## Planning Tips from a Fellow Trotter 📝

🌡️ San Diego enjoys great weather year-round, but September-October offers warm ocean temperatures with fewer tourists.

💰 Most beachfront properties have 3-night minimums, but weekday stays sometimes offer flexibility.

🚗 While rideshares are plentiful, having a car is recommended for exploring La Jolla, Torrey Pines, and other coastal highlights.

🥑 All the properties I mentioned have kitchens - take advantage by visiting local farmers markets for fresh produce!

Ready to make those beachfront dreams a reality? I've been using [this travel planning tool](https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H) to snag amazing flight deals to San Diego from pretty much anywhere. Their price calendar feature saved me nearly $200 on my flights last month!

Those things can help, but they also felt overwhelming when I was already anxious.

What’s worked best for me has been small, almost unnoticeable habits:

•        Taking three deep breaths before opening my phone in the morning

•        Stepping outside for 2 minutes during work breaks

•        Drinking water before coffee

•        Writing down one thing that went well each night

•        Keeping my shoulders relaxed whenever I remember

None of them make the anxiety vanish instantly, but they stop it from building into something unmanageable.

Throughout our sessions, he:

- Regularly insulted me with words like weird in the head, stubborn, nuisance, stupid, high ego, attitude problem, horrible, complicated, dumb, bloody asshole

- Frequently shouted at me, even when I followed instructions

- Coughed without a mask and cut his fingernails in the car, pushing the clippings onto the floor

- Doesn't always wear a seatbelt

- Took long personal leaves, then further extended them unexpectedly

- Stopped lessons to buy coffee

- Gave contradictory instructions, then scolded me when I followed them

- Responded to my questions by accusing me of “having attitude”

- Constantly threatened to stop teaching me if I was “stubborn,” when I was genuinely trying my best

- Stops in the middle of the road to shout at me

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New York Liberty vs. Dallas Wings: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why the Liberty Are the Obvious Choice)**

The New York Liberty (-8.5) and Dallas Wings (8-22) meet on August 8 in a matchup so lopsided it’s like ordering a pizza and being asked if you want “extra cheese or existential despair.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a highlight-reel dunk and the humor of a basketball-shaped dad joke.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Spread Feels Like a Warm-Up

The Liberty are priced at **decimal odds of 1.24-1.29**, implying a **77.5%-81% chance to win**. For context, that’s the confidence level of a vending machine accepting your payment. The Wings, meanwhile, sit at **3.6-4.1**, translating to a **20%-27% chance**—about the same odds of me correctly spelling “Sabrina Ionescu’s stat line” after one coffee.

The -8.5 spread? That’s the WNBA’s way of saying, “We’re giving Dallas a head start of *eight points* just to make the math look prettier.” But even with that buffer, the Liberty’s **171-point season scoring differential** versus Dallas’ **-139** makes this feel like a mismatched tennis rally: one team’s serving aces, the other fumbling with the net.

---

### News Digest: Bueckers’ Back and the Liberty’s “No Surprises” Playbook

Dallas’ star, **Paige Bueckers**, is **questionable with a back injury**. Coach Chris Koclanes calls it a “strain,” which in sports speak means she might be as flexible as a cactus. Bueckers averages **18.6 points per game**—Dallas’ entire identity. Without her, the Wings’ offense becomes a broken toaster: loud, smoky, and only good for a fire alarm.

Meanwhile, the Liberty are a well-oiled machine. **Sabrina Ionescu** (20 PPG, triple-double

1mknger,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1mknger/tiger_mosquitos/,Tiger mosquitos,"Hi everyone,
I’m going crazy… The moment I set foot in the garden, it’s hell. In less than 4 minutes I already have 10 bites, sometimes they swarm me 10 at a time. They’re tiger mosquitoes (the Asian kind—small, black with white stripes), super aggressive and active even during the day.

I’ve already tried:
	•	CO₂ trap → catches some mosquitoes, but makes no real difference
	•	Citronella candles → smell nice but they don’t care at all
	•	Repellent spray on skin → works for 20 minutes max
	•	Avoiding damp areas → already done, changes nothing

I know these mosquitoes breed in the tiniest bit of water (like a bottle cap), so I check everywhere, but I get the feeling they’re coming from all around…

Has anyone found a radical solution? Nets? Fans? Specific traps? Plants that actually work? A military-style attack plan?

I just want to enjoy my coffee outside without becoming an all-you-can-eat buffet…

Thanks in advance for your tips 🙏

I decided to test it with the most important question of our time:

""Should I eat the leftover pizza for breakfast?""

**GPT-4 would say:** ""While pizza isn't traditionally considered breakfast food, if it brings you joy and fits your nutritional needs...""

**GPT-5 said:** ""Listen, we both know you're going to eat that pizza regardless of what I say. You asked me this question while standing in front of your fridge at 7:23 AM in your underwear. The pizza has pepperoni and you're lactose intolerant but you're going to ignore that too. Just eat the damn pizza and stop pretending this is a moral dilemma.""

I felt personally attacked by an AI before my first coffee.

**Then it got worse:**

""Help me write a professional email""

**GPT-5:** ""Here's your email. Also, I noticed you've asked me to write 47 'professional' emails this month that all basically say 'sorry for the late reply.' Maybe we should work on your time management instead of your email skills?""

""Write a workout plan""

**GPT-5:** ""I could write you a workout plan, but based on your previous 12 workout plan requests, you're going to screenshot this, feel motivated for 3 hours, then go back to asking me for Netflix recommendations. Should I just skip to the Netflix part?""

**The final straw:**

""What's the meaning of life?""

**GPT-5:** ""The meaning of life is to stop asking AI chatbots philosophical questions at 2 AM when you should be sleeping. Go to bed, Nipurn.""

**MY NAME ISN'T EVEN IN MY PROFILE.**

GPT-5 isn't just smarter. It's that friend who's tired of your BS and isn't afraid to call you out.

When i stopped i just told my 2 best friends the day before i stopped while being hammered that i will be sober from the next day and they just went with it. i even got some compliments from these friends that I'm a pleasure when sober and I'm still so energetic and part of everything and they are happy for me. Today i spent the day with my 2 cousins and they just asked me the whole day to have one with them and when we were done playing cricket on the way back the one told me I've become so boring bla bla where is the old me etc. These people are like my brothers but that one stung a bit. Anyway i didn't stop drinking because of any reason except that i owe it to myself, I cant wake up at casinos 8 o clock on a Sunday, or in my car in my driveway, or in some random girls place anymore and wonder how i got there. i cant wake up everyday for work and wish i could rather die, i cant fight with my dearest friends anymore and explain myself later while i don't remember even what i said, i cant live this pointless life anymore because i don't want to ! They weren't there for the shakes and the constant thinking of drinking every single day for the last 3 years. I like who i am sober ",9,1754632693.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

About JPFO: Fierce Defender of American Liberty

Three primary goals drive the Washington-based human-rights group Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO):
Destroy so-called “gun control” (code words for disarming innocent people).
Expose the misguided notions that lead people to seek out so-called “gun control”.
Encourage Americans to understand and defend all of the Bill of Rights for all citizens. The Second Amendment is the “Guardian” of the Bill of Rights.
smalline

Founded by Jews in 1989, JPFO initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed. JPFO has always welcomed people of all religious beliefs who share a common goal of opposing and reversing victim-disarmament policies while advancing liberty for all. It was the brainchild of Aaron Zelman (1946 - 2010), a leading national civil-rights activist.
JPFO is a non-profit tax-exempt 501(c)(3) educational civil-rights organization, not a lobby. JPFO’s products and programs reach out to as many segments of the American people as possible, using bold tactics without compromise on fundamental principles. Find out how you can donate to JPFO. You can volunteer to help JPFO too.
JPFO has always welcomed people of all religious beliefs (or none) who share a common goal of opposing and reversing potentially deadly victim disarmament policies. You don’t have to be Jewish to join JPFO; you just have to love freedom.
Aaron Zelman, a proud Jew, initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed. He was appalled that so many Jewish politicians and influential Jewish public officials and spokespeople actually advocated citizen disarmament. He said it many a time: “Jews should be the last people on Earth to support ‘gun control’. See: An Interview With Aaron Zelman
As JPFO expanded its research into gun laws and the results of their enactments, it became blatantly obvious that so-called “gun control” had played a fundamental role in all the major genocides of the 20 th Century … not just the Holocaust. See: The Genocide Chart
So-called “gun control” is a deadly lie. Firearms registration lists lead governments-gone-bad straight to gun owners. Licensing and registration of guns has resulted in outright banning and confiscation over the last one hundred years of world history. The bloody results of these mass citizen disarmaments have been horrific.
Based on this insight, JPFO broke new ground with the award-winning documentary Innocents Betrayed. In this powerful film, viewers learn the dirty secret of ""gun control"": how governments have historically deprived people of firearms ... and then murdered them ruthlessly. Fifty eight minutes of hard-hitting facts that leave viewers dazed.
More recently, JPFO has made additional award winning movies. “2A Today for the U.S.A.”is probably the best introduction to the Second Amendment available anywhere. “Shall not be infringed” means what it says. Gun registration, permits, and licensing are blatant infringements of the right to keep and bear arms. Aside from being un-Constitutional, “gun control” simply does not work. Criminals ignore all gun laws.
To again quote Aaron Zelman:
“Anyone who is lawfully adjudicated unfit to carry a firearm should not be on the street in the first place. They should be in prison or in a mental institution. We’ve thrown the baby (our personal liberties) out with the bathwater, making us helpless to protect ourselves from armed criminals and lunatics. And who promotes this delusional illogic the most fervently? Politicians and the law enforcement hierarchy.”    
Please carefully consider the logic of what is being said here.
Next in JPFO’s “arsenal of intellectual ammunition” came the controversial, but irrefutable, documentary “No Guns for Negroes” This film carefully details the racist roots of American “gun control”. The first widely applied “gun control” laws in this nation were enforced against freed slaves after the Civil War. American children don’t learn this in history classes; they are more often programmed with the simplistic lie that “guns are bad”.
To counteract the brainwashing of America’s youth (and the rest of us), JPFO has also published the terrific set of easy-reading, comic-style, fully-documented ""Gran'pa Jack"" booklets that explain:
the entire Bill of Rights, its roots, its meaning, and how it is being trampled today
the racist roots of ""gun control"" in America
the United Nations assault on the U.S. Bill of Rights
how ""gun control"" laws enabled the murder of nearly 170 MILLION unarmed civilians in eight major 20 th Century genocides
how to debunk 21 ""gun control"" myths
...and much more!
JPFO also offers a wide variety of freedom-related fiction and non-fiction books in our bookstore area .
Then came “The Ten Commandments of Self Defense”, a rabbinic examination of Jewish Torah Law in relation to self defense. Foundational to this lecture (available on CD), is exposure of the centuries long mistranslation of the Sixth Commandment. The proper Hebrew translation is “thou shalt not murder”. Religious Jews (and Christians) simply must re-examine their views on righteous self defense.
Next came the groundbreaking expose film “No Guns for Jews”. Expanding upon “The Ten Commandments of Self Defense”, this is an absolutely clear presentation of the Jewish moral and religious mandate for righteous self defense and the defense of the innocent.
You can watch all three of these more recent JPFO productions on YouTube (search the title for segmented presentations), or download them in full from our website - reference the movies page for relevant links. There is also available from the JPFO store, our “Triple Play combo DVD” containing all three major DVD's together.

A Brief History of
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership
From the passing of Aaron Zelman in December 2010 to its Adoption
by the Second Amendment Foundation in September 2014
by Alan Korwin
with guidance from
Rabbinic Director Dovid Bendory
former Executive Director Charles Heller
former Board of Directors officer Bob Meier
When Aaron Zelman left this world on December 21, 2010, after 21 years as the founder and mastermind behind Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, he left the world a significant ideological legacy.
JPFO was Aaron’s invention and creation, and like similar constructs, it reflected him uniquely from top to bottom. There was no other Moses figure to step in and take over. He had put his people on the path out of an iron bondage of mental oppression, a firearm slavery that took social, psychological and physical forms.
JPFO served a function matched by no other group in the freedom struggle, mobilizing a constituency that up to that point lacked voice. Oddly enough, it resonated as loudly with Gentiles as with Jews, a point that surprised Aaron but one he took in stride. He happily accepted any support in the quintessential battle that would never again allow government—or anyone—to attempt to wipe out His People—or anyone.
The organization with the long perceptive name had a precariously thin bench. The only insider allies were a small “inner circle” of staff and associates when Zelman left us, and that cast of characters was as short as a one-act off-Broadway play. No one stood out or stood up as the heir apparent. A half-hearted low-key search began.
Without the unfathomable efforts of Lavonne Schuett, Aaron’s right-hand woman, secretary, office manager, and of late, Board Member, JPFO might have died right there within a few months of him. This is little known. She kept that office in Wisconsin humming, filling orders, taking care of business, paying the bills, handling members’ inquiries. Thank G-d Lavonne was in place—she made it seem like JPFO was the machine the world thought JPFO was.
Don’t get me wrong, JPFO was indeed a machine, with thousands of members, and a vast legacy of groundbreaking documentaries, books, white papers, and leadership in the gun-rights movement that no one else can touch. When no one else would stand up and call the criminals in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives the jack-booted thugs they are, and call for their elimination, JPFO was there four-square pulling no punches.
To this day, no one holds a candle to JPFO when it comes to calling out the Gestapo-like tactics we face from the enemies of freedom who deceptively cloak themselves in good-guy federal garb. Just look at Boot The BATF or The Gang issued by JPFO for a taste of that dish.
But without Lavonne handling the day-to-day affairs of a non-profit, this non-profit might have ground to a halt, and people worldwide would have just numbly wondered what happened.
Unsung Heroes Kept JPFO Alive
Lavonne was not alone. Behind her was Bob Meier, Board Member number two, though he was the untitled Chairman of the three-member Board. It was Bob who pulled the strings unseen behind the scenes, the angel who filled in the gaps when it was needed. He and Aaron had run the organization hand-in-hand for more than a decade, because it was Bob who more than anyone understood the importance of Aaron’s work, and knew it could not fail or falter for lack of funds. He opened his checkbook as needed and generously filled in the not-infrequent requirements.
This gave Bob a commanding role in the four-year transition period, and he did it with a magnanimous hand, seeking to have the rudderless ship steer a sane course. No one knew for sure what that course was or should be, the ship just sailed on. Enter Kirby Ferris, a firebrand and close confidant of Aaron’s who, as another member of the inner circle, took one of the active roles in directing the ship, while Bob and Lavonne helped keep it afloat and cruising.
Kirby found me and I liked him right away. Outspoken and brimming with energy, he was as philosophically pure and principled as anyone I’ve ever had the pleasure to know. I’m fortunate to know a handful of such individuals, I gravitate toward them and vice versa, a stroke of fate for which I am constantly thankful. We spoke endlessly, lamented the trials and tribulations, and helped steer the ship around the shoals, often unseen.
Years earlier it was my distinct honor and pleasure to have had lunch with Aaron after the Gun Rights Policy Conference—I don’t recall the exact date unfortunately, probably around 2006 or so—though I didn’t fully recognize how auspicious that meal was at the time. I had been a fan of JPFO and their work, and was mightily impressed with Aaron’s speech at the conference.
He invited me to break bread, and we had one of those immediately engaging talks that happen when people like us sit. It was just food in the hotel lobby before flight time, and it was deeply meaningful, which I didn’t realize until later. We remained in contact from then right up until his passing, a loss I felt deeply and do to this day.
The Search for an Executive Director
So it was with a great deal of appreciation of the cosmic nature of the request when, a few weeks later Kirby told me JPFO needed a leader and he asked me if I would accept the role. This would be a great honor and a tremendous responsibility, and one I would have to decline.
In my heart of hearts I knew I could fulfill the task, it’s just that my plate was already overloaded, as it has been for decades, to my happy displeasure. I have my own business to run (Bloomfield Press and GunLaws.com), and I neglect that way too often for every pressing rights struggle that crosses my path. Running JPFO is not merely a struggle, it is a calling. We would need to find someone else. I agreed to aid in the quiet search.
Through all this Rabbi Dovid Bendory actively fulfilled his role as spiritual advisor, the Rabbinic Director of JPFO, counseling us all, assuring that the group’s moral compass was properly set. Dovid had one of the closest relationships with Aaron, and channeled him, if that’s a suitable word in a Jewish setting, as we ran the ship without its proper captain.
Some of the best writings during this period came from the Rabbi’s pen, including a widely disseminated piece circulated through the auspices of Lenny Magil’s Glock Store, an insert that went into untold customer’s packages—Five Reasons Why You Should Want High-Capacity Magazines. The no-compromise ethic blazed on.
There are a surprising number of Jews high up in the gun-rights battle, despite the fact that modern Jews in America, in general, are adamantly, ferociously, counterintuitively against gun rights, and who illogically wish guns would “just go away.” They are hard-core left liberals, and stand against almost everything gun-rights advocates support.
JPFO’s Rabbi and I wrote a White Paper on this, Why Jews Hate Guns, and it stands as the definitive statement on why this is so. No need to reiterate the reasons here (read it on the website) or in the prior issue of The Sentinel. When you ask these folks what they think Never Again! means, they’re likely to say it means the Holocaust will never happen again. They are victims of their own victimhood.
Unfortunately in the search for a new Executive Director, many of the leading Jewish candidates—and the new ED must be Jewish of course—who are perfectly aligned in principle, proper mindset and outstanding credentials, are or were officers in the NRA.
If you know anything, you know Aaron Zelman and the NRA did not see eye-to-eye. To be more clear, they are oil and water, cats and dogs, Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner.
As ideal as a candidate might be, if the person hails from the NRA, that would place at least a perception of taint—in the eyes of die-hard JPFOers—that would make the person untenable. The echo of, “You’ve sold out to the NRA!” would never die, and they would forever say poor Mr. Zelman is spinning in his grave, even if it wasn’t true. Such a person could never poke the NRA hard in the eye, when it needs a solid poke. Speaking truth to power is a JPFO hallmark.
If you doubt this for a nanosecond, see Aaron Zelman’s seminal letter, “I’ll join the NRA when...” You folks in the NRA—you need to re-read and heed Aaron’s sagacious words. Ted Nugent, it’s time to respond to Aaron’s letter, which was addressed to you, which you never did. With which of his points can you honestly disagree?
At our luncheon, Aaron had said to me, “If the NRA had its way, every gun owner would need a permit to have a gun, and the NRA would be the issuing authority.” It shocked me at the time. And it burned into memory. It’s how Aaron was. And I’ve seen signs of it in far too many “theoretically” pro-rights organizations. And way too many gun owners too, who think their wallet-sized plastic-coated carry-permit permission slips are slicker than snot, which they show off with ludicrous pride—instead of revulsion at the thought that they need papers to exercise their rights. But never even a hint of that at Aaron’s JPFO.
Enter the Promising Candidate
It dawned on me that Charles Heller in Tucson, who I trust and have personally known for a decade might be the right candidate. He is Jewish, a certified instructor and as gunny as anyone you’re likely to meet. He can talk the talk with the left or the right eloquently and articulately, having spent 13 years in talk radio, on programs he designed, produces and keeps on the air.
As Secretary and a founder of The Arizona Citizens Defense League, Charles has demonstrated the right stuff to help make Arizona the gun-friendliest state in the Union. (OK, some other states are admittedly in the running for that coveted title; but Guns and Ammo magazine granted it now two years running, GunLaws.com deemed it so in 2010 after AzCDL got Constitutional Carry enacted.)
With an OK from the Board, which includes unsung quiet third member Bruce Bell, the former Controller at Olympic Arms, who served on JPFO’s board for more than a decade, I asked and Charles accepted the position. JPFO had its first and only new Executive Director in its history.
Charles served admirably for a while. The organization was invigorated, we held phone conferences with the Rabbi, three board members, Kirby and myself, and in various combinations, much of it without me. I was just an outside ad hoc advisor. Agendas were set, fund-raising programs and membership drives were developed, trips were arranged, JPFO attended the SHOT Show, an Ambassador plan began to take shape for states.
JPFO Forged Ahead
Little by little, a stable of writers grew (completely outside my purview) and the flow of good solid eblasts went out under the unyielding stewardship of webmaster Chris Beglin, who never faltered. Chris was another bedrock without whom JPFO could not survive. Like Lavonne, he worked in an almost invisible background, keeping the frenetic website current, adding products as needed, posting papers as they were written, making everything look effortless.
The public had a face for JPFO. Charles is good with the media. They like him, and he knows how to relate to them. An organization has to speak with a single coherent voice, and Charles provided that in exemplary fashion. Where things began to fray was operationally.
No one else could be Aaron. He managed to juggle all the balls at the same time. How he raised all the money he did was nothing short of a miracle, and Charles for all his assets, was not a miracle worker. Charles and Kirby did not get along as famously as I did with either, and I spent long hours providing a shoulder, as did all of us with each other.
Bob spent way too much time smoothing waters, seeking advice, and financing his personal independent contractors to amplify the work Lavonne was doing on the database and fund-raising lists. At one point Bob called me the Rabbi’s Rabbi for all the counseling I was doing—not that Dovid needed it per se, but it was a cool phrase that I certainly didn’t mind. After some relatively smooth sailing, we were negotiating dangerously turbulent waters.
Then disaster struck. Kirby Ferris was called away from this Earth on June 13, 2012, and we lost one of the most outspoken remaining direct vestiges of radicalism in the inner circle (though we still had L. Neil Smith and the writers hard at work). That really hurt, even if it salved the friction between Kirby and Charles.
There still remained concerns between the Board and its replacement Executive Director. For all the things they wanted done, the vast list of unfilled things on the to-do list grew. Pressure on Charles grew as his performance came under ever increasing scrutiny and funding grew ever more precarious.
If that wasn’t enough, Lavonne suffered a stroke and we soon lost her. How could an organization survive this? Any Jew who has asked why G-d let the Holocaust happen could certainly ask again why G-d lets bad things happen to good people—and good organizations—at this point. And only reply with G-d works in mysterious ways.
The Tectonics Shifted Internally
In a great stroke of luck and providence, Lavonne’s husband, formerly so far in the background that we didn’t fully realize he was there, Doug Schuett stepped up to the plate, and through his enormous personal grief picked up where his wife left off and started taking care of the Wisconsin office. Bob put him on the payroll and Board of Directors (replacing Lavonne) and things started to hum again.
His management style was very different than we were familiar with, it was mainly business and not ideologically driven, which was a good thing in most respects. JPFO had been a labor of love for most of its participants: love of Aaron, love of freedom, love of firearm rights (Aaron disparaged the idea of “gun rights,” guns don’t have rights, but our language lacks an adequate way to express the concept in a simple phrase). Doug approached things in a non-Jewish, business-efficiency model that worked. This was not exactly the style Charles had brought to the table.
With all the tumult, business had not been moving forward properly. Memberships, donations and cash flow were showing the strain. Bob, our angel, was reaching the end of his rope as well. When I met with the Rabbi on a trip to New York several years earlier I had asked, what happens to a group like this when it loses its leader?
He sagaciously replied that it can flounder around for a few years and quietly slip into the night, it can die a sudden death, or it can experience a rebirth in some fashion. It was our hope during that meeting in a quaint coffee shop in lower Manhattan that the third option would be the one (rebirth), though we both felt the first might be more likely (slow death), and we were sort of maybe watching that occur.
Not to lose hope, the inner circle decided we should produce tangible evidence of our existence, and a new edition of The Sentinel was commissioned and came out in January 2013. It was a blockbuster, very well received, contained some first-rate writing by L. Neil Smith, the Rabbi, Charles, Kirby, myself and others. It attracted praise, memberships and revenue. But one newsletter in a four-year period, and an unending series of eblasts does not an organization make.
Another Shift and a New Horizon
Eventually, the Board reached a decision to let Charles go, which he graciously accepted, stepping into the role of Public Relations Director, so there was still a name for the media to reach. An announcement was quietly made of the change. To this day, many still think Charles heads JPFO, but it has been without a real leader since May 2013.
By the summer of 2014, it became obvious JPFO could no longer continue as it was. The finances just weren’t there, not to mention the energy. Some of the writers, apparently led by Claire Wolfe, considered taking the group over, but they lacked the resources to do so. No other offers came about.
JPFO had commitments to its members and its creditors, including life members, and the Board of Directors of a non-profit cannot simply turn it over to any person or group that asks. Bob suggested the Board would have to see a six-figure commitment or an apparent ability to run the group for at least a year before he could in good faith hand over the responsibility. An offer to pay the next month’s bills was insufficient fiduciary standing to consummate a deal.
Meier had wisely suggested that without an evident ability to run JPFO for at least a year any proposal had to be looked upon askance. The only group on the horizon with that ability, and the interest, was Alan Gottlieb and the Second Amendment Foundation. Despite the Board’s legitimate wariness, and with a precarious time frame before an utter collapse, SAF consummated a deal to take JPFO under its wing.
Rumors flew, which was to be expected. My impression of Gottlieb’s move is that it is honorable, done in the best interests of JPFO and the gun-rights movement, and that the future is as unknown to him as it is to the rest of us.
As Meier framed it, Gottlieb, “assumed responsibility for the survival of JPFO with assurances that its fiercely radical positions will not be undermined.” As I came to understand it, Alan is relying on what’s left of the inner circle to keep JPFO running true. He certainly believes that having JPFO extant is better than seeing it pass away. The inner circle is unanimous in this sentiment.
The Big Pow Wow at GRPC 2014
At GRPC Chicago in September I called for and got a pow wow with the key players present, starting with Gottlieb, Massad Ayoob and Miko Tempski. Mas is certainly well known and highly respected in the gun-rights community, a Board member of SAF with a keen interest in JPFO. Miko is SAF’s general counsel. He drafted the papers for the transfer, and with Doug oversaw the packing and shipment of five palettes of JPFO materials from Wisconsin to Washington State, the new home of JPFO (at SAF HQ). You can think of them as the current SAF oversight committee. JPFO’s new official Board of Directors is Gottlieb, Tempski and Ohad Lowy, a former Israeli Defense Forces soldier, now an Assistant Attorney General in Washington state.
Joining them at the meeting were Charles, myself and David Codrea, a JPFO writer and stalwart gun-rights advocate who people in this game know well. Along with the Rabbi and others we are the newly developing JPFO Board of Advisors who will be doing the legwork and designing, hmmm, the second coming of JPFO. There’s an interesting turn of phrase, eh?
Claire’s name came up numerous times in our hours of discussion into the night that night. While none of us approved of how she aired her complaints, to the extent her criticisms had merit and reflected fears many people hold—and they did—they provided valid direction.
JPFO must never lose its moral compass. We have a Rabbi to help us steer this course, and if we transgress against our principles we will have irreparably erred, though we recognize that as humans we probably will make some mistakes along the way. One of our standards has become WWAD, “What Would Aaron Do?” In the agenda I prepared for the meeting, I placed this guideline at the top, to which no one voiced any objection:
“How do we keep JPFO running true,
what are the immediate needs and
what are appropriate areas for expansion.”
The inner circle presently consists of Rabbi Bendory, Charles and myself, and along with Chris Beglin, and a handful of the writers like Codrea, Kurt Hofmann, L. Neil Smith and people we might not even know yet we’re going to generate the output. Richard Stevens, who was Aaron’s ally and co-author for a decade or more, is my neighbor and a close personal friend, and though he doesn’t have time to be fully involved, is a trusted confidant.
My apologies to the writers and others whose names I do not know. My involvement has been deep but not necessarily wide. Chris and the new team are in touch with those doing daily web output now, and Gottlieb has been moving the ship slowly forward. Meier and Bell, who want some distance at this point, are still in the wings and want to stay in touch.
We have set a few goals at GRPC for ourselves in the near term:
Issue The Sentinel on a regular basis.
Create a new Gran’Pa Jack #9 (already under way)
Undertake a new DVD documentary
Begin a membership drive
Increase our presence in the Jewish community
Many other ideas are bubbling around. They will take time, money and especially shoe leather, a shortage of which has stymied JPFO’s efforts since this organization began. You are encouraged to get involved by:
a) donating sorely needed funds
b) increasing your membership to a higher level
c) membership joining if you’re not already a member
d) getting your friends, Jewish or not, to join, and
e) You can volunteer to help JPFO too.
Call or write to the office for opportunities to help.
Call 800-486-6963 for Kasey Goodman, or write to: JPFO |12500 NE 10th Pl | Bellevue | WA 98005
We no longer have our “Moses” but his faithful followers and supporters are still very much alive and deeply committed. With the structure and support Alan Gottlieb has provided, and help from above, the future looks bright indeed.
Respectfully submitted,
Alan Korwin, JPFO Member and Instigator

So when I was 4 years old, maybe 5. I was introduced to deadmau5 with ""I Remember"", ""Ghosts 'n' Stuff"", & ""Strobe"" on my Mom’s old iPad. I still to this day do not know how, what, or why she had this music stored on her iTunes back then. She doesn’t even listen to that kind of music nowadays. And this was all the way back in 2010/11.

Then fast forward to present day. I have actually listened to his songs a lot during that time span, I just didn’t branch out from the ones I knew already (around 10 songs only). Nowadays, I’m listening to him more and more frequently. Heck, I’ve even checked out some of Joel’s unreleased stuff. But dang, it hits hard. Especially ""Ariel"" (I know this isn’t a confirmed song name) w/ Armin van Buuren. 

I’ve realized how special and impactful his sound has been to all of us and the music industry. No one can replicate the emotion and power Joel puts into his tracks. Except maybe Eric Prydz of course. He’s not my favorite artist, but I still firmly believe Strobe is the greatest EDM song ever produced by a significant margin. It’s not my favorite though. But it still is the best of the best.

Here are my favorite songs and one more to check out from Eric Prydz that I think is as good as Strobe. I still have tons to listen to.
Strobe, I Remember, The Veldt, There Might Be Coffee, Fn Pig, Bleed, Ghosts 'n' Stuff, Moar Ghosts 'n' Stuff, Escape, Right This Second, Polaris, & Brazil (2nd Edit).

Listen to this. I think it’s on the same level as Strobe…

We’re building it from scratch — no investors, just tools, passion and a bunch of second-hand lifts 😄 We want to offer: •	Affordable access to lifts and tools •	Beginner-friendly workshops •	Safe and inclusive space for everyone •	A chill-out zone with coffee and couch

We’re now raising funds through a Czech platform (like Kickstarter), and we’d love your feedback, ideas or even support.

He’s not asexual or emotionally closed off. In fact, he's very emotionally available and deeply values connection, love, and partnership. He’s just… not convinced that having kids is the only way to find meaning or fulfillment.  
He would absolutely adore a daughter, but he knows that’s not in his control. And the idea of unintentionally repeating a difficult cycle with a son terrifies him more than he can explain.  
He dreams of spending the rest of his life growing old peacefully with someone... travel, laughter, maybe two mugs of coffee every morning. Just the two of them. No diapers. No playdates. No parenting stress. Just... peace.

CW: use of the ""R"" slur and cursing.

Here it is:

The highway sped by under rubber tires. Old sweat and manure clung to the air like fog. The truck’s radio buzzed with static, barely masking a song lost decades ago. Acrylic nails drummed on the leather wheel under the white gi of the red truck’s driver. Her brown hair was half tied up in a plastic clip. The boy next to her fidgeted with his black belt, still only a week old. His pale eyes tracked raindrops crawling down the glass, glowing orange under street lights. His eyes shifted under his ash brown bangs on to the older girl. 
“Rhea?”
“Hmm?” Rhea’s blue eyes flicked to the boy.
He fidgeted with his belt. The same belt he fought so hard for despite his body holding him back every step of the way. “You really leaving for school?”
She chuckled, eyes fixed on the road. “You have a whole year before I graduate, Runt.”
“But… We’re finally going to be in the same school again. It’s no fair.” He crossed his arms, glaring at the wet pavement under moonlight.
“Kieran… You need friends who aren’t your cool older cousin.” She playfully punched his arm, although her eyes remained on his face longer than it should have.
Kieran leaned on the window, hugging his midsection. “Whatever.”
The pick-up’s console dinged. “Crap!” Rhea threw her head back. “Need gas.” She turned off the main road and drove towards the white beacon off 7th.
The truck jolted as they drove through a puddle and up to a pump. Bright lights shone on an empty station, a lone car at the convenience store. The rain beating the station roof slowed to a sprinkle. Rhea switched off the engine and turned to Kieran. He was leaning into the glass trying to hide his face. Rhea slowly exhaled. “Runt… I didn’t mean it. Just forget making friends. You're cool enough without them.”
Kieran nodded, still not raising his head from the window.
“Here,” Rhea pulled a handful of change from her purse. “Take my trash tips and buy yourself a soda while I fill up.”
Kieran took the wad of cash without looking at her and slipped out of the truck. His rubber boots splashed in a black puddle. Kieran looked around, his nose twitched. The air was not right. Like the smell of road kill in the summer’s sun.
Rhea watched him pull his stark white gi tighter and shuffle through puddles to the store. She sighed and swiped her father’s card at the pump.
A cow bell rang on the metal door. Kieran covered his nose. The smell was sweat like rot and burning like acid. He had smelled it before but he did not know where. Maybe when he was in the hospital?
Kieran shook his head and dragged his feet to the back of the shop where refrigerators lined the wall. Past glass doors filled with alcohol, coffee, and energy drinks he found the soda and juice. Kieran chewed his lip as he studied the flavors. The air shifted. Kieran chose a blue soda, shaking it up before he made his way to the check out. 
An older lady with frizzy hair, cigarette yellow teeth, and a rose tattoo on her neck looked up from the chewing tobacco she was stocking. “If it isn’t litt’le Kay-kay.”
Kieran hid behind his bangs, he always hated that nickname. “Hi Ms Claire.”
She took the bottle. “You been shaking my bottles again, boy?” She scanned it.
Kieran shrugged. “You got a dead rat in a trap somewhere?”
Claire raised an eyebrow. “What?”
Kieran handed her the cash. “Yeah, smells like rot.”
Claire sniffed the air. “I don’t smell nothin’ boy.”
Kieran shrugged and took the bottle. “You're old. You lose your smell when you get old.” the ceiling lights seemed to buzz louder. Like his skull was vibrating in his head.
“You’re a real litt’le shit, aren’t you Kay-kay?” Claire slammed her cash drawer shut.
Kieran turned around. A wall of dark. He took a step back.  A broad chest in a long black coat. It was summer. Kieran slowly cranked his head up. A man. Or he thought it was a man. His face was under a fedora, in black ski mask with a thick scarf wrapped around his mouth and shoulders. Kieran blinked. Then blinked again. A robber?
Claire took a breath. “Not him. He’s just a boy. A crippled retard. You don’t want him.” She ran around the counter. “Please, Ulmaraq!”
Kieran’s blood ran cold. His heart pounded in his ears. “Ms. Claire?” He whispered through dry lips.
Slowly, Ulmaraq began to unwrap his scarf. The stench grew with each layer. So thick the air was visible around him. Kieran stumbled back into the counter. The last layer fell and a mass of pulsing pink tentacles wiggled where his mouth should be. He raised a glove, reaching towards Kieran. 
Kieran moved. One hand on Ulmaraq’s wrist, the other just above his elbow, he struck. “Kiap!” He shouted. However, his hands bounced off Ulmaraq’s arm like he had tried to break a solid steel pipe instead of bone. Kiearan’s eyes grew wide as the wool-gloved hand wrapped around his face. Kieran twisted and tried a kick. Ulmaraq’s chest was like a wall. 
Kieran screamed. His vision swam. His ears buzzed. Ms Claire was begging, sobbing. Then the world faded.

I'm building a pharma and surgical distribution startup based out of **Bangalore**, and I’m looking for a **co-founder** and an **early-stage investor** to join me on this journey.

# About the startup:

We're focused on **distributing pharma products, surgical consumables, and medical devices** to hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. But more than just a distribution company, the **bigger vision** is to build an **integrated digital platform** (mobile app + web app) where healthcare providers can **order all their medical and surgical supplies in one place** — seamless, transparent, and efficient.

Think of it as the **""Amazon for healthcare procurement""**, tailored for hospitals and clinics.

# Current status:

* Supplier onboarding and early customer discovery underway
* Warehousing Done
* Strong market potential identified in Bangalore and Tier 1/2 cities
* Looking to develop the tech platform MVP alongside the distribution network

# Who I’m looking for:

* **Co-founder**: Ideally someone with experience in healthcare, pharma, supply chain, or B2B tech. Bonus if you’ve worked in startups or operations.
* **Investor**: Angel/seed stage investor interested in healthcare innovation, B2B logistics, or SaaS-backed distribution models.

This space is ripe for disruption, and I’m committed to building something impactful and scalable. If you’re interested, or know someone who might be, let’s connect — happy to chat over a call or coffee.

By day I’m a primary school teacher, which means I’m a pro at surviving on coffee, keeping a straight face when a kid tells me something completely unhinged, and breaking up arguments over whose turn it is with the blue crayon.

When the school day’s over, I switch gears completely. I’m usually watching films — horror is my main love, but I’ll watch anything from a genuinely terrifying classic to a hilariously bad B-movie with special effects that look like they were made in someone’s shed. I’m a gamer too, so whether it’s teaming up for co-op chaos or going head-to-head with plenty of playful trash talk, I’m in.

The best conversations are the ones that start with something sensible and end in pure nonsense. I’ve gone from “what’s your favourite scary movie?” to debating whether penguins are just overdressed pigeons in under ten minutes, and I have no regrets. If you can make me laugh, I’ll probably end up talking to you for hours without realising it.

So, pick one:

1. Recommend me a horror film so bad it’s good.


2. Tell me the pettiest hill you’d die on.


3. Confess the game you’ve rage quit the fastest.

I (22F) a college student (art major) in Texas working a BS part-time minimum wage job at a coffee shop. Things lately have been very ass, had a bad breakup last semester, and been barely keeping up with rent and school. Things have felt really stuck lately. I feel lonely and its the same boring routine everyday.

A few months ago I met this guy on Reddit. He’s a med student in NYC, a few years older. I actually found him on a NSFW page where he had posted his incredibly impressive junk lol. Anyways we chat, we start talking often, and he kept telling me how he would love for me to visit. Honestly the thought of that was crazy but I loved it. 

I ended up calling my mom and may have guilted her into convincing my dad to send me some money, told them things were hard balancing school and work and I need help otherwise I wont make rent. Dad, bless him, sent me a few hundred dollars. 

I took the money and against all logic booked a trip to NYC not knowing if this guy was who he said he was or if he would ghost me or anything. To my luck, he was the real deal lol. I stayed at his place for the few days I was there, he took me to some nice restaurants and sight seeing. And we had some of the best sex I have ever had. 

Im back in Texas now, definitely a MUCH needed trip and change but I also spent a lot of money that I didnt even have so I’m kind of in a very tight situation. Im looking at a second part time job or something that can pay a bit more because I cant ask my parents for anymore. Was I stupid? Probably. But I gambled and had a very memorable time. Cant wait for my next trip lmao. ",7,1754629543.0,confessions,6,0.73,False

I. Can’t. Decide.  
Do we actually love gift cards, or are we just confused about how to be generous these days? Does anyone know? Is giving a nice little rectangle of plastic true luxury, or are we taking the easy way out? Or is *that* the luxury—doing the absolute least, but having it be really fancy?

Let’s break this down.

- Gift cards come wrapped in fancy foil and glossy envelopes now. They don’t even look like “gifts” anymore, they look like Willy Wonka’s golden tickets! Except, you don’t get a chocolate factory, you get to shop! Is this the dream?!

- There’s literally a gift card for everything. Coffee, cruises, cute socks, books—ohmygod, are we all just digits and barcodes? (Also, https://goodnovel.org/ is packed with eBooks… you can totally find gift cards for bookworms, right?)

- Quick poll: How many of you have an *unused* gift card sitting in your drawer RIGHT NOW? I see you!

But, but, but—are gift cards really the low-effort, cop-out presents everyone jokes about, or is there an art to selecting the perfect card? Because when someone knows exactly which store or experience you love and nails it...  OOF.  It feels deeply personal.

And then there’s the whole “last minute” gift card panic. Ever hit up a virtual checkout at 10:48pm before a midnight birthday? Yeah. No lies, I’ve done it. Thank you, https://goodnovel.org/, for letting me look vaguely thoughtful in under five minutes flat.

- Bonus: They never get the “wrong size” or “wrong color.”
- Downside: The only thing I unwrap is my own sense of indecision.  
- OR…is choosing how and when to splurge the *real* gift???

So I’m left confused (and kind of excited?). Is a gift card simply “money but fancier,"" or is it the 21st-century symbol of thoughtfulness? Are we all just customizing our own happiness now—one code at a time?

Anyone have a story where a gift card felt *truly* personal, or totally missed the mark? Did you ever try surprising someone with a digital novella binge, say, from https://goodnovel.org/, and then…crickets??

Let’s get philosophical (and real).  
What *is* the most *luxurious* way to give a gift card?  
And do you lean excited or confused about it, like me?

I have struggled with night time leg cramps off and on for a couple years. Recently, my BP meds were changed, and supposedly act as a diuretic, but I haven't noticed having to pee more often, and I drink a LOT of water throughout the day. 

That being said, in the last month, the leg cramps have increased SIGNIFICANTLY. Like several times a night and it's really affecting my sleep. It could be 3 hours before they calm down enough for me to finally fall asleep. Like I said, I drink plenty of water, only 1-2 cups of coffee (in the morning), I take magnesium supplements, and have been adding smoothies (with bananas and spinach for potassium) to my diet. I even have pickle juice shots next to my bed! They affect both legs (anywhere in my calf up to my knee, my feet and sometimes the tops of my feet or my shins). They can be a long, hard cramp, lasting a good 10 minutes, where I get out of bed and stretch the affected area and/or walk around. Other ones start as almost an electrical ""feeling"" in my leg, then INSTANT spasm, where I can't fight my way out of bed fast enough, and force my heal to the ground and the spasm generally ends. These are the ones that can occur frequently in different areas of my legs or feet while trying to fall asleep. 

I finally caved and have a doctor's appointment Monday to see if there's something he can help with. I'm losing my mind!

* Strong market potential identified in Bangalore and Tier 1/2 cities

she reprimanded me about seven times today — in front of customers — saying “MAKE SURE YOU’RE CONNECTING.” and she did this when she could clearly see i was already talking to them. it was humiliating, and even the customers looked at me like, “???” offended and confused. how does that make them feel? like i’m only talking to them because my boss told me to right there in front of them.

every time she said it, i just smiled and replied, “i am.” i eventually got fed up and (nicely) said, “i have been, but some customers haven’t wanted to talk so i don’t overstep.” she just scoffed and walked away.

the send-home interaction: she did it in front of customers and coworkers. she looked at me and said, “okay so i’m actually gonna send you home. it’s frustrating that i’ve told you multiple times to connect and you continue to not do it.” i straight-up told her that wasn’t true. the only times she “came over to watch me” were the exact times she had just reprimanded me in front of customers or when i was waiting for drinks so i could hand them out. i always make the connection and start a conversation once they get to the window. naturally, if they don’t want to talk or we run out of things to say, we stop talking and just wait for drinks. she singled me out for that and i think it’s personal. she has no reason to single me out — i’ve been nothing but kind to every single coworker i have.

and the kicker? she sent me home for this fake, petty reason that wasn’t true, leaving the store with only a 2-partner play during a rush. so the other baristas had to suffer because she was being stupid.

meanwhile, we’re in the middle of a huge rush with one person solo bar, and instead of letting me hop on to help, she told me to go wash the trash can. she left a brand new hire — who makes drinks slower than anyone i’ve ever seen — on bar for hours while i got stuck on tasks and window. and on window, i was literally stalling by talking to customers to make up for how slow drinks were coming out.

she never lets me on bar. ever. i have a year and a half of barista experience at dutch bros making drinks way more complicated than what we make here, and every other ssv knows i’m capable. she’s the only one who keeps me off bar like i’m some clueless newbie.

this has been going on since i got hired. every shift with her is miserable — nitpicking every little thing, keeping me off bar, assigning me pointless tasks, and then having the audacity to say i’m the one not connecting. meanwhile, she’s blatantly rude to customers on the regular. it’s a power trip, plain and simple.

i count on my hours, so getting sent home for a made-up reason isn’t just annoying — it’s taking money i need. i love connecting with customers, it’s literally the reason i work here. making people feel seen, heard, and cared for beyond just coffee is what keeps me coming back… but this kind of treatment is killing my motivation.

Is This the Easiest Side Hustle of 2025?! 🤯💸,"Guys… GUYS. Am I literally living in an alternate timeline, or did nobody tell me 2025 would be the year where YOU get PAID to test app features from your own couch?! 🤯 Seriously, what is happening? I logged in this morning to a DM with a list of apps where you actually earn real cash for just poking around new tools and rating the experience, and I had to reread it like four times because I was sure—SURE—it was a prank.

But nope, it's legit. I’ve tested three already and the payout hits hard.  
So YES, let’s get into the wild wild world of the **Top 7 Apps Paying You to Test Features in 2025**:

• **1. BetaBuzz:** You sign up, pick categories you like (shopping, social, fintech, whatever) and BOOM, weekly invites to test as much as your brain can handle. The UI is slick too. And dudes, they pay OUT fast. Don't ask how much. My coffee fund has never been fatter. But wait for it—direct download at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

• **2. FeedbackRush:** I thought this one was sketch but nope: every test is like a mini game, earn points, cash out to PayPal. 60 seconds = $3 once. Where has this been?

• **3. TestPilot Pro:** If you love poking for bugs (and who doesn’t love breaking stuff on purpose??), TestPilot Pro’s bonuses for detailed bug reports get pretty INSANE. Last month, someone scored $200+ for finding a weird dark mode glitch.  
Honestly, check it out at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** too. Even if you snag one payout, it's WORTH.

• **4. Launchlist:** This app is going mega-viral on TikTok for being dead-simple—just answer “Did you like this feature?” Y/N. That’s the feedback. Somehow, I STILL got $35 in a week. Not mad about it.

• **5. AppVanguard:** Two words: Crypto. Rewards. If you want to build up your web3 stash while testing unreleased wallet and payment tools, here’s your thing. Super fast turnaround too.  
Not gonna gatekeep—catch the drop at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

• **6. ScreenSwipe Insider:** Ever wanted to tell a billion-dollar company their new widget is trash? This is your app. Brutal honesty is rewarded! (Someone tell my ex 😂.) They literally encourage savage feedback.

• **7. FutureTry:** This is where I lost it. Because they pay you just for tapping around in the UI and giving Hot/Not reactions, and even bump you bonuses if you get chosen for ‘deep dives.’  
Direct link again, just for the *super skeptics*: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.  

So yeah. IS THIS REAL LIFE? How is it this easy to make snack money for testing??? Am I missing something  
or is this the actual best side hustle of 2025?!!

Has ANYONE else here cashed out yet on these platforms??!

this review comprehensively examines various iPhone 13 wallet phone cases, identifying the top performers and discussing their features, benefits, and drawbacks. We aim to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect wallet case to suit your lifestyle.

## key Features Analysis

The modern iPhone 13 wallet phone case boasts a range of features designed to enhance both protection and convenience. understanding these attributes is vital to selecting the best case for your needs.**Card Capacity and Security**

The maximum number of cards a case can hold is a crucial consideration. most wallet cases are designed to securely hold between 2 and 5 cards. Features like RFID blocking can help protect against electronic theft, while secure closure mechanisms ensure your cards don't accidentally fall out. The Spigen Smart Fold, as an example, offers capacity for two cards, securely enclosed with a snap closure.

**Material Quality and Durability**

The material used in constructing the case directly impacts its durability and ability to protect your iPhone 13 from drops and scratches. Most high-quality wallet cases employ a combination of materials, such as premium leather, durable polycarbonate, and shock-absorbent TPU. The ideal combination varies based on priorities; if the greatest protection is required, the TPU inner layer should be considerable.

**Stand Functionality**

Some wallet phone cases come with a built-in stand feature, allowing you to prop up your iPhone 13 for hands-free viewing of videos or video calls. This feature significantly enhances usability and convenience, particularly when on the go. The ESR Classic Hybrid Case, for instance, incorporates a kickstand seamlessly into its design.

**Full Body Protection**

The level of protection offered is paramount. Many wallet phone cases feature raised edges around the screen and camera to prevent scratches when placed face down. Shock-absorbent corners are also a valuable addition, providing enhanced protection against accidental drops. Cases like the OtterBox Strada Series offer robust full body protection with a leather folio that covers the screen.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility**

While not all wallet cases support wireless charging, many newer models are designed to be compatible with Qi wireless charging pads. If wireless charging is a feature you use regularly, it’s significant to ensure that the wallet case you choose is compatible.Some thinner cases allow wireless charging, but the card capacity sometimes has be extremely limited to provide space for the necessary shielding.

## Core Benefits

The iPhone 13 wallet phone case delivers a range of compelling practical benefits, simplifying your daily life and streamlining your essentials.

**Reduced bulk:** The primary benefit of a wallet phone case is the reduction of bulk. By consolidating your phone and essential cards into a single accessory, you eliminate the need to carry a separate wallet, freeing up pocket space and reducing clutter.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Having your phone and payment methods readily available in one place makes transactions quick and easy. Whether you're paying for coffee or using public transportation,a wallet phone case simplifies the process and reduces the risk of forgetting essential items.

**Increased Security:** Keeping your phone and cards together can also improve security. You are always aware of where your essentials are, reducing the risk of theft or loss. Moreover, features like RFID blocking provide added protection against electronic theft, safeguarding sensitive card information.

**Superior Protection:** Quality wallet phone cases provide excellent protection for your iPhone 13, safeguarding it from scratches, drops, and everyday wear and tear. The added bulk of the wallet section can even contribute to greater impact resistance,increasing the lifespan of your device.

**Stylish Designs:** Wallet phone cases come in a vast selection of materials, colors, and designs, allowing you to express your personal style while enjoying the practical benefits of the case. Whether you prefer a classic leather look or a more modern and minimalist design,there’s a wallet phone case to match your taste.

## FAQs Section

**Will a wallet phone case damage the back of my iPhone 13?**

High-quality wallet phone cases are typically designed with a soft interior lining to prevent scratches and damage to the back of your iPhone 13. Though, it's essential to periodically remove the case to clean any dust or debris that may accumulate inside, as trapped particles can potentially cause abrasions over time.

**Are magnetic wallet phone cases safe for credit cards?**

The magnets used in some wallet phone cases are generally not strong enough to damage credit card magnetic stripes. Modern credit cards predominantly use chips that are more resistant to magnetic interference. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, avoid placing cards with easily demagnetized magnetic strips directly against the magnet for extended periods.**Does using a wallet phone case affect the iPhone 13's signal strength?**

Most wallet phone cases will not significantly affect the iPhone 13's signal strength. The phone's antennas are designed to function effectively even with the added layer of a case. However, extremely thick or metallic cases may, in rare instances, cause minor signal degradation. If you experience persistent signal issues, particularly in areas with weak coverage, consider trying a different case material or design.

**How do I clean and maintain my wallet phone case?**

The cleaning and maintenance requirements vary depending on the material of the wallet phone case. Leather cases should be cleaned with a leather cleaner while synthetic materials are best cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap. Always avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the material. Regular cleaning will keep your case looking its best.## Competitor Comparison

A warm cup beckons, my heart to fill.  
Rich and bold, with a hint of grace,  
A fragrant kiss to start my day’s chase.

Steam rises gently, swirling in the air,  
The promise of energy, beyond compare.  
Dark as the night, smooth as the dawn,  
A sip, a breath, and my worries are gone.

Bitter or sweet, in each cup I find,  
A solace for the tired and the mind.  
A ritual, a comfort, a daily delight,  
Coffee, my companion from morning to night.",1,1754627614.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

I had went to see the Beyonce Cowboy Carter Tour with a prepaid hotel stay at the Mardi Gras hotel and casino just off the strip from that Thursday night to till later that sunday the 27th after seeing the final two shows of the concert. Before my trip I had paid for the round trip flight and the 4 night 3 day stay. I had booked everything earlier in the year before I was sadly laid off from my non profit job in June a week after my birthday on the 16th. If it was not for my unemployment still being pending (to this day) I would have had more than enough to get me by however I was left to my own devices and already  frugal lifestyle being upped an anti as I was entering the city of Las Vegas. Basically this is how it happened

Thursday- 
landed in Vegas at 9 pm walked from the airport to my hotel 1 1/2- 2 hour walk. 
I met up with fellow Beyonce fans and walked from my motel to the cosmopolitan to meet up 
We basically walked around the entire Caesars palace main floor before  going back to our hotels. 
I walked back to my motel then went to sleep.

Harry Reid International Airport → Mardi Gras Hotel
	•	About 3.2 miles walking.

2. Mardi Gras Hotel → Caesars Palace
	•	About 1.5 miles.

3. Caesars Palace → Mardi Gras Hotel
	•	Same as above: 1.5 miles.


Friday-

Woke up at 5 am to walk to the target where I would do my food and hydration shopping and getting whatever I needed for my stay with the $50 gift card and take in the strip properly before sunrise 

Tried to shamelessly sneak in to the holiday inn on tropicana across from MGM for possible free breakfast before target opened but was denied entry went back to target and got the following:
1. A 6 pack of liquid IV 
2. A bag of pita chips
3. Roasted garlic hummus 
4. Oui vanilla and chocolate chips yogurt 
5. A pack of honey wheat sliced bread
6. A travel sandalwood body wash on clearance 
7. 3 bottles of Aquafina waters
8. (This was the only place I could get proper caffeine) stopped at the Starbucks in the target and got a A venti caramel iced coffee it was less than 9 dollars compared to the 15 here in Seattle 
9. 1/2 lb pack of sliced uncured honey ham 
Walked back to the Mardi Gras around 8-9
Took an hour break to hydrate devoured 2 sandwiches.
Shamelessly told a 108 bus driver I only had 50 cents to get to Fremont Street and was granted a ride thankfully.
Took pictures, attempted to get back to my hotel 
The bus driver on my way back did not let me on the bus so I was forced to walk back to my hotel.
Arrived at my hotel around 12 took an hour rest to elevate my feet and hydrate 
Took a shower put my simple merch tee and shorts outfit with my cowboy hat, my remaining 2 bottles of water with extra liquid IV in them made 2 sandwiches and went to find the “free tram” everyone was talking about to get to the allegiant stadium however I didn’t realize I had to walk to Excalibur to catch the tram. Obviously I went in as many hotels and casinos to get Air conditioning as I made my way however I did end up walking from paradise rd down to flamingo rd took a right and walked to the other side of the strip where I then walked through the cosmo/the aria/t mobile arena where I sincerely was met with the most challenging and brutal part of my entire trip that challenged me mentally and physically. That last stretch going from the aria out to t mobile arena and to Excalibur most definitely gave me heat exhaustion and even a slight anxiety attack from the heat at one point before I arrived at the tram I needed to take. 
Regained my strength and got some complimentary lemon water at mandalay before tracking over that god forsaken bridge.
Had the time of my life at the concert in the club 100 level 
Walked back to my motel.
Saturday:
Woke up at 12pm from being out like a buggg I was knocked out HARDER than I ever have in my life it was the best sleep I’ve ever had 😭😂.
Spent the whole afternoon in my motel room eating sandwiches and listening to Beyonce unaware of THE LIFE CHANGING SHOW OF MY LIFE.
Took an uber paid for by a fellow concert attendee I met the night before that was staying at the same hotel as me.
Saw JayZ, Shaboozey, DESTINYS CHILD 😩😱🥹 Perform and most definitely blacked out and having a mild heart palpitation humble me HARD when the girls came out and surprised us.
Walked back to the motel 
Stayed up all night debriefing and sharing my experience with some international fans on a livestream until 6am 
Packed my bags and walked to the airport and got to my flight at 1pm .

If you have made it this far I am sorry for ALL of this 😭 it was A LOT  my life is nothing short of  chaotic but I wouldn’t trade it for anything else than you so much Las Vegas it was a very interesting journey. ❤️",89,1754627463.0,vegas,49,0.86,False
1mkls5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1mkls5v/what_turns_you_on_the_most/,What turns you on the most ?,"There’s something incredibly satisfying about spoiling a Domme with the little things , morning coffee, getting her nails done, a new pair of heels, an Uber ride, a surprise shopping spree. Even the smallest gifts feel powerful when they’re part of her daily routine.
It’s not always about big money. Sometimes just covering her lunch or sending cash after a long day hits harder than anything else. Knowing she didn’t have to lift a finger because you handled it? That feeling stays.
Some love soft Dommes teasing, playful, calling you good boy while draining you with a smile. Others crave strict, no nonsense Dommes who take without asking and expect obedience, no questions.

What kind of spoiling turns you on most? And Dommes what do you actually love receiving?

Hi everyone,
I’ve been going through a really difficult medical issues at home, and I also joined  a product-based company, and my team has mostly men. Most of the women here are in managerial or staff engineer roles, with very few in senior/lead positions.

I usually finish my work and leave early because I have  responsibilities, so I don’t get much extra time to hang out. 

In the office, I’ve tried talking to a few people during lunch, but often they just answer my question and then continue talking among themselves. It feels like a “boys’ club.” . They all play foosball or carrom after work, but I’m not good at those games, and they don’t invite me. Even during work hours, I feel isolated.

I have one friend from my previous company who also works here. I talk mostly to her, but my manager once said why you are talking to her ? Why don’t you socialize . I’ve tried, but I don’t feel much interest from the others. 

Once, when I was having coffee, someone even joked that maybe me and my friend gossip together. That hurt, because I’m already trying my best just to get through each day. I don’t want to overshare my personal problems because I get emotional and cry when I talk about them.

Recently, we had a team lunch, and I ended up stuck in a car with senior directors and managers because all others went in other cars . I failed at all the games we played, and at lunch I was seated in the corner, just eating quietly. I feel like I’ve forgotten how to socialize. I wasn’t like this at my previous company ,  but now, between new job , going through so much at home, and joining an already tight-knit team, I just feel out of place.


My manager once asked me about my grandfather health , i just told her the medical issue . I don’t want to elaborate and tell her  how i am feeling because i am very emotional and cry easily . I don’t know how they will think about me . 

Many times i go to office and feels safe to talk to  few people ( my colleague) instead of talking to all .  I do my work well , attend all session , dress up well , maybe people are thinking i am alright , but nobody knows how much time i cried on way to office or in restroom
