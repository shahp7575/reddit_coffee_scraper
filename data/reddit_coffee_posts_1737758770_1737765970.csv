I’ve lived here for several years and have a good sense of the city but would love to hear your favorite places and activities. I enjoy hiking and cycling (although I rarely do either anymore). Hit me with your favorite trails, favorite coffee shops, places to road bike, other things to do, etc etc etc. Looking for things that take as little as 1-2 hours or day trips to take from Portland.

1i9askv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHApeaceRP/comments/1i9askv/end_event_the_raid_cut_4/,[ END EVENT ] [ THE RAID ] [ CUT 4 ],"the aftermath of chaos leaving Kazuyuki alone in the rubble-strewn corridor. Shadows stretched like skeletal fingers across the walls as emergency lights flickered, casting his hunched silhouette into jagged fragments. His breath hitched—a sound too loud in the suffocating silence—as he registered the two figures lingering nearby: the boy who’d cheated death, and the healer whose quirk stank of antiseptic and desperation. *Leftovers*, he thought bitterly, his throat tightening around a laugh that felt like broken glass.

“The guy who ‘died’ and the healer quirk…” Kazuyuki’s voice dripped with a mockery so sharp it could flay skin. He tilted his head, his smile a grotesque mimicry of warmth, cracked at the edges. “Not bad for a pit crew.”

The words curdled in the air. Ewan flinched, his fingers twitching toward the raw, peeling skin around his nails—a compulsive dance of pain and distraction. Kazuyuki didn’t miss it. He never did.

“Man. I just realized something.” Kazuyuki’s voice dropped, the bravado crumbling as he leaned against a shattered concrete pillar. Its rough edges bit into his palm, grounding him. Or maybe punishing him. “I’m not cut out for this bullshit. This place *fucking* sucks.” His laugh was hollow, echoing down the corridor like a ghost. “I’m getting beat up left, right, center. My whole group left me, and… and now I’m stuck with…” He gestured wildly, the motion jerky, unhinged. “A schizophrenic patient and the only student who can heal everyone. What the *fuck*? I didn’t sign up for this. Why *me*? This whole fucking…”

He choked. The flicker of a memory seared his mind—*cold steel tables, the whir of bone saws, Hakamura’s eyes glinting like a scalpel under surgical lights*—and his fist slammed into the wall. Dust rained down, bitter on his tongue.

Then, stillness.

When Kazuyuki turned back, his smile had warped into something feral, unsteady. A marionette’s grin with its strings half-cut. “Hey guys…” He stepped closer, boots crunching over debris. “You wanna take down something even better than a villain?”

Ewan’s stomach lurched.  Kazuyuki’s gaze pinned them—not a request, but a dare. A plea.

“I… I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Ewan whispered, his voice fraying at the edges. His fingertips dug into a raw cuticle, the sting a feeble anchor against the tsunami of *wrongness* crashing through his skull. “But… I don’t want to be left alone. So I guess… I’ll just come.”

Kazuyuki’s eyes narrowed. For a heartbeat, Ewan saw it—a flicker of something fractured in those pitch-black irises. Then Kazuyuki closed the distance, his hand clapping Ewan’s shoulder with a force that bordered on violence. But the grip softened, trembling, as he yanked both students into a bruising embrace. The healer stiffened; Ewan froze. Kazuyuki’s voice vibrated against them, low and raw:

“I *understand*. That feeling of being stranded… all alone…”

***\[Flashback: The Lab\]***  
*Cold. Always so cold. The fluorescent lights buzzed like flies feasting on rot. Kazuyuki’s small hands pressed against the observation glass, fogging it with each shallow breath. Behind him, Hakamura in a white coat murmured numbers, cold and clinicaas the restraints bit into his wrists. “Please,” he’d begged, voice splintering. “Don’t leave me here.” No one answered.*

***\[Flashback: Hakamura’s Glint\]***  
*The doctor’s smile. Always the smile. A crescent moon of cruelty as he adjusted his glasses. “Remarkable resilience,” Hakamura had purred, fingers trailing the scalpel’s edge. “Let’s see how much more you can endure.”*

***\[Flashback: Letting Go\]***  
*The last monitor flatlined. A shrill, endless beep. Kazuyuki’s hand fell limp against the lab floor, his vision blurring. I’m sorry, he thought, not knowing who he was apologizing to. I’m so sorry.*

Kazuyuki jerked back from the embrace as if burned, his breath ragged. A single black tear streaked down his cheek, viscous and iridescent—a relic of Morphie’s corruption. He swiped at it furiously, his teeth bared in a snarl.

“…Things don’t exactly go our way,” he spat, the words jagged. His gaze locked onto the horizon beyond the broken windows, where the sun bled crimson into the sky. “But that’s life. Nothing really goes our way. We adapt. We *survive*.”

He turned, his shadow stretching long and monstrous across the floor. “So let’s go wild.”

The healer hesitated. “Where… are we going?”

Kazuyuki’s laugh was a serrated thing. “A lab.” He didn’t look back as he strode forward, each step cracking the silence like gunfire. “To take down a man who’s got nothing but insatiable greed in his rotten chest.”

The words hung, a guillotine’s promise.

Ewan stared at Kazuyuki’s retreating figure—the tremors in his hands, the way his shoulders hunched as if carrying the weight of every scalpel, every scream. *He’s not okay*, Ewan realized. *None of us are.*

But he followed anyway.

  
Dangers’ boot slammed into the wall, cracking the plaster. His scarred hands trembled—not from fear, but from the white-hot rage simmering in his veins. Kazuyuki’s monologue about labs and “taking down a man” buzzed in his skull like a wasp. *Pathetic*. He spun on his heel, teeth bared, and roared:

**“Bullshit—**!”\*\* The word tore through the room, guttural and raw. **“I don’t listen to** ***anyone*****.”**

He stormed toward the exit, his leather jacket reeking of smoke and old blood. Halfway there, he paused. Glanced back. His voice dropped to a venomous growl: **“But you’re right about one thing. I’m leavin’ this damned place and—**”\*\*

A spike of pain lanced through his skull. Dangers staggered, clawing at his temple. Behind his eyes, the world shifted—foggy, muted. There, cross-legged in the void of his mind, sat Lam Lee. The kid’s single arm rested on his knee, fingers curled in a meditative pose. His braid hung neatly over his shoulder, untouched by the chaos outside.

**“...Just like the old man taught me,”** Lam Lee murmured, eyes closed.

**“The** ***fuck*****?!”** Dangers snarled aloud, shaking his head as if to dislodge him. **“You lost the bet, kid! I take the body for a day—you** ***said*****!”**

Lam Lee’s eyelashes fluttered. When he opened his eyes, there was a weight to his gaze—a sadness that made Dangers’ stomach churn. **“You’re right. I did lose.”**

**“Then** ***shut it*** **and let me—”**

**“But Dangers,”** Lam Lee interrupted, his voice steady as a blade pressed to a throat, **“I can’t let you leave that place.”**

***Something is trying to break free.***

The walls of Dangers’ mind shuddered. Cracks spiderwebbed through the mental landscape. He laughed—a harsh, broken sound. **“The** ***fuck*** **you care what I do?!”**

Lam Lee rose slowly, his braid swaying. **“That door you were at earlier… the one you couldn’t break. Even** ***I*** **sensed it. Someone’s inside. They need our help.”**

**“Listen, you sanctimonious little—”** Dangers’ fist smashed into the concrete wall, splitting his knuckles. Blood dripped, but he barely felt it. **“I don’t** ***give a damn*** **what you say! You lost the bet. Now I’m.** ***Leaving*****.”**

Lam Lee inhaled deeply. The air in the mental space smelled of incense and rain—memories of the old man’s hut. *“You’ve got to focus on your self. Not your personalities,”* the old man had said, calloused hands adjusting Lam Lee’s posture during training. 

***Something is about to break.***

Lam Lee’s throat tightened. He thought of Astra— the way she’d thrown herself in front of danger tosave a stranger. *Heroic*. *Foolish*. A tear slid down his cheek, hot and shameful.

**“I’m sorry, Dangers,”** he whispered.

**“The** ***hell*** **you—”**

Lam Lee’s hand—his *only* hand—snapped upward. A golden thread glinted between his fingers, taut and humming. 

**“I’m sorry for you both.”**

He pulled.

The thread *sang*.

***LAM LEE DELETED DANGERS.***

***\* Lam Lee Has 1/6 Selflessness.***

**Kenta** tilted his head back, the sky a bruised purple-gray above him. His laughter died in his throat, replaced by the metallic tang of blood on his tongue. The ground beneath him felt like broken glass—every pebble digging into his spine a reminder of *him*. His twin’s face flickered in his mind: that same mocking smirk, the way he’d turned his back. *Shitty memory. Shittier ending.*

He gritted his teeth, forcing himself upright. ""You should probably text your class,"" he barked, voice roughened by cracked ribs. ""Tell ’em not to trust anyone who’s been kidnapped. We’ve got less than a minute before the adrenaline wears off… and we *really* start hurting.""

**Uzuki**’s jaw tightened. He fished his phone from his pocket—the screen spiderwebbed with cracks, reflecting his own battered face. His thumb hovered over the class group chat. *Monaco’s smirk. The way his punches had felt… wrong. Too controlled. Too cold.*

\[Monaco betrayed us. Don’t trust anyone. There could be more traitors. Stay together. I’ll meet you soon.\]

He paused, then added: \[Monaco was acting weird. Something’s off. Be careful. He tried to kill me.\]

The *send* button clicked like a gun cocking. Uzuki stared at the sky, his fist clenching until his knuckles blanched. ""...Why is he so *strong*?"" he muttered, the words ash in his mouth.

**Makito** skidded to a halt, his healer’s gloves already glowing faint gold. The students on the ground groaned, their uniforms torn and bloodied. Rage boiled in his gut—*Who did this?*—but he swallowed it, channeling the heat into his palms. ""Who did this to you?"" he asked softly, though he already knew.

**Uzuki** coughed, crimson spattering his chin. ""Monaco Knox. Class 2 rep. He… betrayed us.""

""Ah. Makito. Pleasure."" The healer’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. ""Doubt brought me here. These injuries…"" He gestured at Uzuki’s shattered collarbone. ""If I heal you, will you rush back? This’ll drain me. Don’t expect miracles.""

**Yu** rested a hand on Makito’s shoulder, his voice calm as still water. ""After healing, we hunt Monaco."" He turned to Kenta and Uzuki. ""Is he tired? Injured?""

**Uzuki** raised his palm, heat rippling faintly. ""He is… but someone might heal him."" His eyes narrowed. A cold, flickering signature pulsed in his senses—*wrong*, like ice in a furnace. ‘*That’s…*’ His frown deepened. ‘*I know that chill.*’

**Kenta** hauled himself up, wincing. ""I saw where he went. Bad idea, but I’m following."" He glanced at Uzuki. ""Heal me. Once I’m up, we double-team. I’ll need fire. Just… don’t make it weird if you can’t.""

**Yu** closed his eyes, steadying his breath. ""He went up. We act *now*. React later.""

**Kenta**’s gaze locked on Monaco’s abandoned sword. ""I can track him. If he’s with another, split them. Four of us—me vs. Monaco, you handle the rest. Can’t use Genbu, but I’ve got options. Or swarm him if he’s alone.""

**Uzuki**’s tail lashed, snagging the blade. He tossed it to Kenta. ""Here. Return it when done.""

**Kenta** shredded his torn tracksuit top, fashioning a makeshift sheath across his back. Metal scraps clinked as he swallowed them, jaw working. ""Almost time to hunt,"" he growled, crouching in a runner’s stance. ""You three keeping up?""

**Uzuki** snorted. ""*I* should ask *you*."" His golden ring glinted as he pointed northwest. ""Liam’s there. Class 2’s heat signatures… close. Yu—copy my quirk. Burn his ice. Makito—stick with Kenta. Heal Class 2.""

He hoisted Makito with his tail, ignoring the healer’s yelp. ""Time to be heroes

Hiroto stared at the shadowy figure clad in a karate gi, its face obscured by the dim light filtering through cracked windows. The voices in his mind hummed like a swarm of wasps, low and commanding: *This is it. A sin. Stay calm. Don’t fight. Convert.* His throat tightened, but he forced his voice steady.

“You must be a sin… well, my name is Hiro—”

The clatter of footsteps interrupted him. Rin burst onto the scene, human again but still panting from his sprint, his golden eyes wide with urgency. Hiroto’s pulse spiked.

*OH MY GOD, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. DO THESE IDIOTS HAVE A TRACKER ON YOU?!*

*HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW!!!* Hiroto snapped back internally.

The voices hissed, colder now: *Whatever. You know what to do. The moment is here. CONVERT NOW.*

He exhaled sharply, fleeting images of Class 4’s camaraderie—shared jokes, victories, Rin’s easy grin—flashing behind his eyelids like dying embers.

“Rin. Stand with me,” Hiroto said flatly, though his fists trembled at his sides.

Rin stepped forward, shoulders squared.

In a blur, Hiroto spun and drove a backkick into Rin’s jaw. The impact echoed off the walls as Rin crumpled, clutching his face.

“Sorry for the interruption,” Hiroto said, voice devoid of warmth as he turned back to the figure. “As I was saying… my name is Hiroto Yamazaki.”

Rin staggered upright, blood trickling from his split lip. “What the hell—?”

Hiroto’s front kick slammed into Rin’s stomach, hurling him into the concrete wall. A gasp tore from Rin’s throat.

Seven and Taiyou froze at the stairwell, eyes wide.

*TAKE THEM OUT NOW. KILL, KILL THEM!!!*

Hiroto lunged, fists flying. A double punch sent Seven and Taiyou skidding down the steps.

He turned to Rin, hands shoved in his pockets, face a mask of indifference. Inside, the voices cackled.

*YES, YES HIROTO! GOOD JOB. YOU’RE SO CLOSE. CONVERT!!!*

“The voices inside my head told me to do this,” Hiroto said, tapping his temple. “And I know I made the right choice.”

*YOU’RE DAMN RIGHT YOU DID. WOOOHOO!*

He let the voices’ cheers hang in the air before continuing, tone clinical: “Let me explain. I’m not here to take you or the sins out. I’m here to destroy the heroes. You and I share the same goal. I don’t consider you my enemy… because I’m betraying the heroes. I’ve decided to convert. Embrace the dark side. So I hope you… and the others… will welcome me.”

*FINALLY, YOU DID IT HIROTO. LET’S GOOOOOO! LET’S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.*

Rin groaned, pushing himself up. Hiroto’s gaze locked onto him, eyes glacial.

“Rin… because of you… I had to concede to that *bitch*.” His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. “Do you remember that fight? Do you realize how much I’ve suffered because of you?”

*YES, KILL, KILL THAT BASTARD!*

Hiroto’s fists clenched until his nails drew blood. “I’m going to get my revenge… and then fucking kill you.” He glanced at the figure. “Are you going to stand there and observe… or join me?”

Rintaro wobbled to his feet, glaring at Hiroto’s hollow stare before turning to the figure. “You. What did you do to him? Is it mind control? Turn him back. *Now.*”

He faced Hiroto, pity softening his tone. “I had no idea you felt so strongly about the fight. We’ll settle this once you’re back to your senses. But until then…”

Rin yanked Hiroto closer and smashed his forehead into Hiroto’s nose. He staggered back, wiping blood from his brow, and squinted into the darkness.

“Seven… is that you?” Rin panted, gesturing to the figure. “Deal with him. He must be controlling Hiroto. Food’s on me if you do.” His gaze hardened as he turned to Hiroto. “While you do that… I think I’ll be having a rematch.”

Seven and Taiyou exchanged glances. Taiyou tilted his head, innocently holding up a bread roll. “Wow, your class is full of strange people.”

Seven scoffed. “Tch. You better be of help, Bread Kid.” His six tentacles erupted from his chest, writhing like serpents as he glared at Ryumon. “These guys have their troubles to fix… and I have food to get.”

Taiyou blinked. “I have bread.”

Seven snarled, “Shut up and follow my lead,” before lunging at the figure.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hiroto’s head snapped back from the headbutt, blood trickling from his split lip. He grinned through the pain, teeth stained crimson, and lunged. His fists became a blur—feinting a punch at Rin’s bruised face before driving his knee into the boy’s unprotected stomach. Rin doubled over, gagging, and Hiroto pivoted, a spinning heel kick cracking against his ribs. Rin crumpled, wheezing.

“I *am* in my senses, you stupid animal man,” Hiroto sneered, rolling his shoulders. The voices cackled in his skull, their approval warm and intoxicating. “Why wait? Let’s settle this *now*.”

*‘Okay, guys, let’s do this. It’s showtime!*’ he thought, bouncing lightly on his toes. For the first time in weeks, the ache in his joints was gone, replaced by a buzzing, electric clarity.

*‘GET HIM, HIROTO! SHOW THEM WHAT YOU’RE MADE OF!’*

He dropped into a taekwondo stance, fingers twitching. “Bring it on, animal man. Let’s end this shit.”

Rintaro dragged himself upright, every muscle screaming. His vision swam—Hiroto’s cheap shots had shattered his guard, his ribs, his focus. Blood pooled under his tongue, metallic and thick. *Last time… I beat him. But this isn’t him.*

His nails elongated into claws, canines sharpening as a feral snarl ripped from his throat—but it died halfway. The hyena’s wildness faded from his eyes, leaving only resolve. He let his claws retract, though patches of fur still bristled along his arms.

“I can’t… I *won’t* hurt you again,” Rin panted, swaying. He raised a trembling, half-transformed hand. “I’ll bring you back. *Believe it.*”

Hiroto scoffed, tensing to strike—

A body slammed between them.

Taiyou sprawled on the concrete, blood seeping from his temple. “G-gah…” he choked, fingers scrabbling weakly.

The two froze.

Up the stairs, Ryumon stood motionless. Seven writhed against the wall, impaled not by his own tentacles—but by a pitch-black one that pulsed grotesquely, its surface slick with his blood. Beside Ryumon, a figure stepped forward: tanned skin, green eyes glinting like frost, black hair tousled by an unseen breeze. Indifferent. Hungry.

The black tentacle retracted, slurping back into the stranger’s chest. Seven slumped, gasping.

“I should introduce myself,” the man said, voice smooth as oil. “To my friend’s schoolmates.”

He tilted his head, smiling faintly.

“My name is… Shinji Nakamura.”

**SHINJI NAKAMURA.**  
**SIN OF ENVY.**

Monaco’s wings shuddered as he plucked two sword-feathers from his plumage, their edges glinting like fractured obsidian. Blood seeped from the gashes on his arms, mixing with tears that streaked his pallid face. He stepped forward, each footfall crunching against the frostbitten ground.

“I’m sorry… but you all can’t go any further.” His voice cracked, raw and ragged. “For the sake of the world.”

Hina’s eyes narrowed, her stance coiled like a spring. “I don’t know *who* the fuck you are,” she spat, pacing in tight, predatory circles. “But if you’re a hostage, now’s our chance to get the hell out of here.”

Her boot slammed into the ice, fracturing it. “But if you’re *not*—” She dropped into a fighting stance, knuckles whitening. “—then I won’t show mercy. *Hellhounds*, be careful!”

Liam exhaled slowly, his breath crystallizing in the subzero air. Energy pulsed around him in glowing, accelerating rings. “I suppose I can be considered a hostage,” he drawled, smirking. “But before we discuss that… *hellhounds*? Seriously? That’s corny as hell.”

Hina’s jaw twitched. “You little *bastard*!!! What’s your name… Ryumon? Mugen? *Liam*?” Her eyes widened—*Liam Grace. Terrorism suspect.* She tensed, ready to strike.

“Don’t call me a bastard, ya bastard,” Liam sneered, energy swirling faster. “Be polite and introduce yourselves first.”

“You’re *stalling*, bastard! Thought I wouldn’t know?!” Hina lunged, her body blurring as **DEAL: Agility for Physical** activated. Muscles bulged unnaturally beneath her skin, veins throbbing—a five-second surge before the crash.

Liam flicked his wrist. **\[Absolute Frostbite\]**. The air plunged to -200°C, ice erupting across the floor. He skated backward effortlessly, taunting: “Were you so angered by the hellhound comment? Acting like a hurt little puppy.”

“Why am I so angry…?” Hina snarled, smashing her fists into the ice. **DEAL: Taste for Touch**. Her palms split open, blood sizzling against the frost. “Because. They are my *friends*.” She glanced at Touji, Yuuki, and Nam, her grin feral. “And I may be a little puppy… but at least I’ve got my *pack*!”

“How very touching,” Liam mocked, pirouetting on the ice like a dancer. *That window…*

“Touji!!! Smash this ice!” Hina barked, pointing. “Yuuki, Nam—flank him! *Go!*”

Monaco’s wings flared, stone feathers slicing through the air like shrapnel. “He’s not your problem. Your fight’s with *me*.”

Hina froze. “Monaco? *Why?*” Her voice dropped, venomous. **DEAL: Eye for Ear**. The world muted as she lunged, relying on sight alone.

Monaco recoiled, wings cocooning around him. “I’d say it’s good to see you… but that’d be a lie.”

“Bastard, stop *fucking* talking!” Hina’s fist cracked against his armored feathers. She grinned wildly. “Promise not to go easy on me, motherfucker.”

Monaco crouched, crossing his arms in an X. “It’s a deal, then.”

“By the terms… Monaco Knox won’t go easy on me. In exchange, I gain—”

**“PREZ, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!”** Touji barreled past, fists slamming into Monaco’s guard. Ice splintered underfoot.

The trucker—a chain-smoking man with a *Godzilla vs. Megalon* tattoo—had only grunted when they’d climbed into his rig. Forty minutes of stale coffee fumes and staticky radio later, he dumped them.  
  
The truck’s headlights vanished into the rain-soaked Tokyo, leaving Kazuyuki and Ewan shivering under the flickering neon sign of the abandoned hospital. *Tokyo Municipal General*, the letters read, half-eaten by rust. The building loomed like a skeletal hand clawing at the sky, its windows shattered, ivy strangling the walls.

“...This is it, Ewan,” Kazuyuki muttered, his breath a pale ghost in the freezing air.

Ewan nodded, fingers digging into the straps of his backpack. The smell hit them first—antiseptic rot, stale blood, and something sweetly chemical. They stepped over broken glass, their footsteps echoing through corridors lined with rusted gurneys and peeling posters warning of contagion. A single fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering like a dying pulse.

***Crunch.***

Ewan froze. Something shifted in the shadows ahead—a skittering, like rats… or scalpel blades dragged across tile. He latched onto Kazuyuki’s arm, his voice a squeak: “D-Did you hear—?”

“He’s here,” Kazuyuki whispered, staring into the dark.

A gleam of light caught glass. First, the reflection: a lab coat, pristine white. Then the man himself.

**Naoki Hakamura** emerged, his smile a crescent moon in the gloom. The jar in his hand sloshed faintly, its black goo writhing like a living thing.

“Kawasaki! *Kid!*” he chimed, voice dripping with paternal warmth. “What brings you here?” His gaze slid to Ewan. “I see you brought a friend.”

Kazuyuki stepped forward, fists clenched. Hakamura tilted his head, the smile never faltering.

“But Kawasaki…” He raised the jar, the goo pressing against the glass as if hungry. “Tell me…” His voice dropped, syrupy and lethal. “…why do you seem… so...”

The goo *thumped*.

***“…Hostile?”***

The stairs groaned underfoot, each step exhaling a century’s worth of dust. Loki swiped a hand through the air, but the particles clung like cobwebs, thickening with every breath. Mahito coughed into his sleeve, eyes watering. “The fuck *is* this?” he rasped. “Asbestos? Ghost dandruff?”

Loki didn’t answer. His head swam, the corridor ahead warping as if underwater. The dust wasn’t just dust—it *pulsed*, alive with a faint, sickly shimmer. Mahito staggered, bracing himself against the wall. “Yo… this shit’s laced,” he slurred, squinting at the motes glittering in the dim light. “Like… fucking *fairy poison* or somethin’.”

At the corridor’s end, a figure materialized.

She leaned against a rotted doorframe, her silhouette backlit by a cracked stained-glass window. The gown clung to her like liquid silk, translucent enough to reveal the curve of her hip, the shadow of her collarbone. Her hair cascaded in ink-black waves, framing a face that belonged on a Renaissance canvas—all full lips and heavy-lidded eyes.

**“Loki, dear…”** Her voice was smoke and honey, curling around them. **“You came to see Mommy for yourself?”**

**“Poor thing,”** she purred, reaching to brush dust from Loki’s shoulder. Her nails gleamed venom-green. **“You look… parched.”**

Mahito swatted her hand away. “Save the MILF act. We ain’t here for a wine-and-cuddle sesh.”

Komari’s smile sharpened. **“No?”** She traced a nail down Mahito’s cheek, drawing a bead of blood. **“But you’re** ***exactly*** **my type. All that…** ***anger*****. It’s** ***delicious*****.”**

**CRASH.**

The door exploded inward, smacking Mugen square in the temple. He stumbled, blinking rapidly—and then *grinned*, wild and unhinged.

“**HELL YEAH!**” Mugen whooped, shaking off the hit like a dog shedding water. “TWO ON ONE? *NOW* WE’RE TALKIN’!”

**Martin** (red eyes blazing, flame sword in hand) and **Lam Lee** (braid whipping, single arm coiled) exchanged a glance. *Something’s off.*

Mugen lunged first—not with martial arts precision, but a haymaker aimed at Lam’s jaw. Lam ducked, his braid lashing out like a whip to wrap around Mugen’s wrist.

“You’re *enjoying* this?!” Lam snarled, yanking Mugen off-balance.

“**DUH!**” Mugen laughed, using Lam’s pull to swing himself into a cartwheel kick at Martin. “Fightin’s *FUN*! C’MON, FLAME-BOY—LIGHT ME UP!”

Martin parried with his sword, flames licking Mugen’s shin. Instead of recoiling, Mugen *howled* with glee. “**HOT HOT HOT!**” He ripped a leg off a broken chair, twirling it like a baton. “MY TURN!”

“Why’s he… *laughing*?” Lame hissed, dodging a wild swing.

Lam’s braid snaked around Mugen’s ankle, tripping him mid-charge.   
  
  
“Possession wore off,” Martinrealized. “This is just… *him*.”

ed, his red eyes narrowing. “Wait—*Vin’s gone*? You’re… just *like this*?!”

“**BINGO!**” Mugen lunged, grabbing both their heads and *smashing* them together. “JUST **ME**, MY FISTS, AND YOU DORKS!---- though i can't seem to quite remember what happened.”

Lam spat blood, wiping his mouth. “You’re insane.”

1. AM: At most a water wash and rosehip oil moisturise then makeup straight on.

Every 5 or 6 months I'll do a 30% glycolic acid peel at home which just causes mild flaking for 4 days. 

My skins is clearly dehydrated or my barrier damaged. I didn't know it even really existed or could be damaged. 

I have orange peel texture, dull and tired looking skin, regular dryness on cheeks and nose. Lips always look dry and pale. 

I eat well and drink lots of water. 
My blood tests all come back fine except for chronically low ferritin that doesn't seem to affect my energy levels. 
My skin type seems to be DSNW.

There's a lot of potential change here so please offer up any advice you have.

What would you do?,"We've been together for almost 2 years and recently started talking about moving in together. I like where we are going together as a coupe and I say our relationship has been strong and steady. But something that's been bothering me since day 1 is not getting worked on and I'm tired of bringing it up.

He's always late. He's late to work (his workday is 9-5 but always gets in at 11 at a startup), he's late to flights, and he's late to our dates. A few instances:

\- We were supposed to pick his parents up from the airport one day. I kept checking the traffic because they were arriving around rush hour at the end of a workday and I noticed the time getting longer and longer. Knowing it takes him a while to get ready and actually head out, I figured that 45 min drive to the airport with him spending 15 minutes getting ready, an hour was going to be perfect. I let him know a little over an hour before that we should leave at X time. He said ok I'll get ready. We're 5 minutes into that hour and he was still scrolling on his phone so I said we should leave soon since the traffic is getting crazy and I know how his parents hate waiting. He said ok again and didn't move. After giving him 20 minutes to get ready, he didn't move an inch so I said I'm going to the airport by myself and I'd appreciate it if he'd be ready to go to dinner as soon as we get back. He said 'Noooo baby why are you going by yourself?' and when I explained how I gave him 30 minutes to get ready and head out but he didn't do anything, he blamed his depression (he's never been diagnosed) and said he needs to brainrot to wind down from his long day. His long day? He went to work for lunch and came home right away. He watched TV for a few hours. We got to the airport 2 hours later than we expected to.

\- For my birthday and our anniversary, he made a dinner reservation at a place we both have been dreaming to go to. Without traffic, it's 30 minutes away from where I live but given street parking is needed, I'd say 35-40 minutes. He was going to come pick me up and go to the restaurant together. Dinner was at 8, he left his apartment at 7:45, got to me at 8, and we arrived at 9. The restaurant had a 15 minute grace period and because he did not respond to his texts and calls about the reservation, our table was gone.

\- We were out of town for his friend's wedding. Wedding ceremony was at 4pm and our hotel was 10 minutes away on foot. I told him we should get there around 3:30 to say hi to our friends who also attended the wedding and he said ok let's leave at 3:15. While he was putting his clothes on, he checked his email and found out his favorite brand was having a sale. He didn't move one bit and started browsing the sale. I said we can call a Uber and head to the wedding if he wants to browse the sale to save time. He said no I need to do this now since things are going to be sold out when I have time later. He spent 15 minutes standing in the bathroom browsing the sale, didn't buy 1 shit. When I told him we should head out soon, he said he still needs to finish dressing up and put his shoes on. We left the hotel at 3:40, and halfway to the venue, he said he forgot his tie clip. I said he looks great and I don't think he'd really need it, but he said he needs it and said he's going to run back to the hotel and that I should just go. This was HIS friend's wedding. I said I'd go back with him and we can take a car back so we don't have to walk in a hurry. He said fine let's head back, so we hurried back to the hotel and because he was sweating, he said he needed to shower. I was out of words. I was devastated and disappointed. He eventually was ready to go at 4:30pm. By the time we got to the wedding, the ceremony was over and everyone was gathered around for drinks.

Just this morning, we were supposed to meet up for lunch and go see an apartment together at 2. We chose a lunch place near the apartment opening and were supposed to meet at 1. Instead of 1, I told him we have a reservation at 12:30 so I can just be there at 1 and I don't have to wait. He said he was leaving at 12 and arriving at 12:20 so I hurried and got to the lunch spot right at 12:30. He wasn't there and he didn't leave any messages so I called him to see where he was, and he said he had to get gas and he had to pee so he stopped by at a cafe and couldn't just use the bathroom so he got a cup of coffee and a pastry. He never showed up to lunch. I ate by myself and he came to the apartment showing at 2:30.

He blames him being late on ADHD, depression, and me being pushy with our schedule. But if I don't give him a set schedule to do certain things, he never does it. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and I'm starting to wonder if he values me or my time. I tried to talk to him about this so many times but every single time he said I need to chill and not get uptight with schedules. Sure if it's just the two of us getting coffee that's fine but he's always late to our appointments for apartments, weddings, meeting my parents, and pretty much everything in his life.

I tried to be nice and understand that sometimes people take a while to get mentally and physically ready for things, but maybe I shouldn't have. What would you do?

  
Edit: He once told me during our argument about this, that he's the type of person who'd be late to his own wedding.",2,1737765539.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1i9anmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1i9anmj/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

My partner says they love me but I'm not stupid, I can tell they're waiting for the perfect exit point. They care enough that they think if they left it would devastate me. It wouldn't, it's expected at this point and I wish they would just tell me the truth. I'm a miserable cunt and there's no reason to stay with me. 

The harder I try to be happy and positive and the things that people want, the harder it feels I fail when the happy mask backfires. I don't understand how other autistic people are happy and I can't get anyone to understand me. 

I want to be successful. I want to start my own coffee shop. I did coffee for 5 years before the place was bought and I got booted. I can't plan a business though. I don't know what I'm doing. I only got a GED. I'm stupid, but I've got people fooled, they tell me I am intelligent but I can't even figure my own self out.

1i9acbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9acbv/4_months_breakup/,4 months breakup,"It’s been 4 months since the breakup and 1 month since last contact. I just need some advice from people who never met me or my ex so can be objective. 
We started dating 3 years ago having been friends for 1 year before. I was in a different relationship when we first met, an incredibly abusive one, so I eventually ended it. 
We remained friends and it did seem like he wasn’t all that interested in me. I got the job but couldn’t find an apartment straight away so he let me stay with him rent free and it was fun for both of us. He was quite lonely and I think enjoyed my company. While I lived with him he said he wanted to ask a Starbucks barista out and that there was a French girl he is interested in. So I thought he clearly wasn’t interested in me. I then managed to rent an apartment and moved out. Several days later he told me he finds a prospect of a relationship with me appealing. I said I do too and asked him if he wanted to stay for tea and he said he had work the next day. 
It was quite lovely afterwards - he would meet me at the train station (I used to commute for work), cook dinner and we would frequently hang out. He would send me flowers on Valentines fay and text me throughout the day. He was always busy two days a week when he was playing computer games with his friend and I was fine with it. He would also go meet his friend for tennis once or twice a week and it did upset me a little that he didn’t play with me and we used to play a lot. Then he started meeting another friend once a week so I started feeling a bit left out but decided to just work on my social life and meet my friends / catch up with my parents in the meantime. 
I met his friends and it was going okay at first although there were several occasions where I didn’t feel comfortable and he didn’t say / do anything. When I organised a birthday party for my ex, his friend started moaning the place I booked was too expensive and there was nothing to eat there (even though I shared the location and the menu in advance to make sure everyone would be happy) and we actually left the place and went to a cheap italian cafe across the road which I saw as a disrespect towards me. His friend also made this ongoing joke that I am an alcoholic after I confided in his girlfriend that someone in my immediate family had issues with alcohol. 
I didn’t say anything at the time although I probably should have. In hindsight, I think I should have communicated my concerns more clearly to him but at the moment I didn’t want to ask for his attention, I thought if he wanted to be with me he would make time. On weekends we would go to his friends where he would play tennis with the guy and I would stay at home with the girlfriend which I didn’t find very fun as she just wanted to watch TV and I work in TV so I wanted something different from a weekend. I also felt excluded as they would always discuss their past experiences and I felt I couldn’t really add anything. But main thing was we just didn’t connect so I didn’t really enjoy spending time with them and I think the feeling was mutual. But it was still civil at that point. 
I am from Ukraine so when the war began, I was deeply affected by it and obviously made every possible effort to get my mom and brother into the UK, where I lived with my ex. I think I was surprised by the lack of support he provided as it was a very black and white situation for me and I thought it would be natural for my partner to support me unconditionally. His friend sent me a ""supportive"" message in which he said that basically he hopes my family is okay and he is confident russia didn't come to destroy Ukrainian cities, especially big ones. It offended me but it wasn't on my list of priorities at the time so I didn't do anything about it. When my mom arrived my ex was acting a bit defensive - not sure why, but possibly because he didn't feel comfortable with my mom being so close even though we never shared accommodation or even a building. So the tension was there and I felt torn between him and my mother - there were instances when he would suggest my mom shouldn't have let our family dog play with his dog cause for some reason he thought our dog might have rabies. That upset me because I felt it was unfair of him to suggest that and also I was surprised he would put additional pressure on me in a time like that. His friend unfollowed me on Instagram and apparently the reason was because he didn't like my post about the war because he uses Instagram for fun and also he disagrees with me blaming russia. Yet, he would continue watching my stories which meant he would have to manually find my account every day. When I told my ex I though it was creepy, he just dismissed of it. 
My priority was my family and I shifted from my ex towards them which, I understand, upset him. But then he would clearly prioritize his friends over me so in my mind he shouldn’t be too upset with me. I felt that my mum clearly needed my support and that I had to be there for her. He found my 10 year old brother loud and annoying and didn’t like my mom either. I felt like he didn’t have to add this additional pressure and could be a little more empathetic. What my mum was going through was living hell - with my dad being left in a city that was being bombed, no certainty in the future, she didn’t need my ex’s comments about how loud my brother was and all that. He even called them gypsies once but he probably didn’t realize I heard him.
I understand that this was challenging for him as well - he chose to date me, not my whole family and my anxiety but I had no control over this situation and I think if he was more supportive we would have grown closer. 
His main concern was that I didn’t get on with his friends. I organized a surprise party for him and invited all his friends and even got him a certificate for an experience he could enjoy with his friend. 
But our relationship didn’t improve - there were occasions where they invited him over explicitly telling to come with his dog but without me. His friend’s mother posted on social media that she is proud to be russian and I said I don’t want to be around her which offended his friend. I found it upsetting that my ex would happily have dinner with his friend’s mother but not mine. As a Ukrainian I take any pro russian comments were personally and want nothing to do with people who support or find excuses for the war. 
All while my mum was taking care of his dog while he was away and helped us out numerous times. 
I didn’t feel comfortable around his friends and didn’t want to spend time with them - I was already dealing with a lot and while they are probably not evil, they did make me feel bad about myself and I just couldn’t afford that. I never prevented him from spending time with them but he wanted me to be there and be friends with them. 
I agreed to go on holiday with another group of his friends only to find out that the girl has been going on solo trips to russia (she’s not from there, doesn’t have family there and is just an admirer). I was frustrated but felt I couldn’t afford to have a problem with yet another one of his friends so didn’t say anything. It did upset me that his social circle was like that though. 
My mom decided to return to Ukraine which made my ex very happy and he didn’t even hide that and it made me anxious because I knew they would not be safe. 
This was two years into a relationship and I felt unheard and betrayed. I started second guessing the relationship but couldn’t build up the courage to do anything.
I think I still loved him but I didn’t feel like myself any more. And we still had our moments of closeness. 
I started doubting our financial arrangement - he earned way more than I did but we paid for everything 50/50. He worked from home , I worked from the office but all the bills were 50/50, even the monthly extra payment for the dog was 50/50. He would do things like pay for the coffee and then request £2 back, on one occasion I was really anxious and couldn’t eat the food I’ve ordered so he’s eaten it and then request money for it and told me to take pregnancy test so that he’d be calm. 
We were living like flatmates as I didn’t really feel emotional connection any longer and he said his only problem with me was that I didn’t get on with his friends. While I felt betrayed by his lack of empathy. I frot trapped and unhappy. 
Eventually I reached a point where I couldn’t be around his friends anymore. I thought they really treated me poorly and who are they to treat me that way. We went to a festival with them and I probably came across as a bit rude and hostile, I was so annoyed so I decided to just remove myself from a situation before I say anything. I spent time with my friend although I did come to say goodbye and we did exchange some words when we saw each other there. He found that unacceptable and left the next day. He said he consulted his friends and they agreed. I didn’t protest and said I was about to offer a similar scenario as I was drained. He quickly found a flat to rent, didn’t let me have a dog for a few days and would frequently reach out about practical matters. I asked him for a closure chat and he agreed and was genuinely upset and even crying saying it was a good relationship and the external factors ruined it. I gave him a list of things I was unhappy about and asked what he was unhappy about in return. He said it was the friends situation and I had too many clothes and there wasn’t enough space for his new motorbike uniform. 
It’s been 4 months and I still can’t let go. He still follows me on insta and sometimes watches stories / likes posts. I think friendships and relationships can exist in parallel and don’t have to cross. I miss him and sometimes catch myself thinking I should reach out. What is wrong with me?

For example, if we had sex when we saw each other I just notate it as a number in that entry. I’m 3 months into this relationship. I’m debating:

-should I tell her now?
Or
-should I keep this to myself?

1i9a4gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1i9a4gl/the_reflection/,THE REFLECTION,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

would like to start I am currently seeing licensed therapist, just looking for advice/others experiences

theres so many layers to this, but i swear I am trying to make a long story short.
Ive (f28)been with my boyfriend, call him Matt(m30)for about a year and a half. I found out he was emtional cheating with one girl, then sexual cheated with a different girl, a few months ago and we have been going to couples therapy.  last week, after a therapy session that was very triggering, first time we really talked about the cheating, I am super passive, hate confrontation. - side note,  my childhood growing up with my family, we would get into a big argument and then acted like nothing happened, never talked about that. - so I did what I know best, and didn't bring up any of the cheating until therapy.

this was all in a matter of a few hours:
I went through his phone after the said triggering therapy session when he was sleeping and found him talking to another female(sabrina) about meeting for coffee, and lying about the shitty best friend, let's call him jake, he was hanging with. - which he told me a few hours before in the therapy session, he had no contact with jake. (another side note, Jake sent my nudes around  school when  I was 16.  Jake also did this to another girl. not sure how he got away with it twice. AND matt met the two girls he cheated with me through Jake.)So I obviously hate his fucking guts and Matt knows this. to the point he lied in therapy that he was talking to Jake because he knew how upset I'd be - last therapy session I was crying so much I couldn't breathe. 

so Matt wakes up to me going through his phone and I asked who tf is sabrina was. at this point he had gotten up from where he was sleeping and went towards me. I ran around the table and was screenshooting the messages with Sabrina and said you can have your phone when I  send my these to myself so I don't run back to you AGAIN. he said okay and then lunged at me and grabbed my throat and pushed me against the door. I screamed stop and he automatically let go.  I started to get dressed to leave, the whole time hes saying sorry and following me. I scream get the fuck away from me you just had ur hand around my throat. he starts breaking down, more upset than I ever seen him, literally crying on the floor. 
even after him being physical, I couldnt leave someone i love so much so upset, so I was consoling him and we're both crying and he had to be the one to tell me to leave. 

at this point it's 3am. I left his house. I currently live with my parents with my 2 dogs who will bark at anything. so I felt like I couldnt go home, so I 'slept' in my car in a well lit gas station parking lot for about 5 hours.

We didn't talk about it, besides in therapy 6 days later. in those 6 days I felt so connected to him, we were having great sex , which has been a problem a good part of our relationship. delusionally I thought we were good - as good as this situation could be. 

Jump to yesterday, I was really turned on all day and I was texting Matt about it throughout the day and we talked we would do it later after dinner. 
we had dinner, then he got really tired after a long day at work. Which is totally valid, happens to everyone. so when he started falling asleep, I was very surprised because he always wants to have sex, especially since our sex life was lacking. I was surprised and hurt so I tried conveying that and was silently crying while laying with him. When we got up so I could leave, his shirt was wet from me crying and he said ""Jesus christ. drink some water, half your intake is on my shirt."" with a look of disgust, said he had to change and left me to change his shirt. At this point I grabbed all my stuff and was still visibly upset and walked to my car. I've told him in the past to please just stand at the door and watch until I'm safely in my car. and he closes the door. he says he watches through the curtains but it still hurts he can't wait at the door for the minute it takes me to walk to my car. 
I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt so I waited in the driveway for 10 mins. seeing if he'll come out or text or call or something. he doesn't,  so I leave crying late at night and I have bad eyesight to being with, let alone at night.  I blocked him seeing my location . that's when he started calling and texting repeatedly for about 15 mins. 
I text him 45 mins later saying ""I am home safe and I would never leave you high and dry and not answer, and I'd hope you'd do the same. 
his response was im glad your safe. doesn't comment on other message. so I say you really have nothing to say to this? - doesn't answer, I try calling, doesn't answer 

this morning he texted saying he needs space and if I need my stuff from his house I could get it.
we texted a few times back and forth and I asked him if I could come by for a few mins  to explain last night. he said he's not available and anything I wanted to say I could text him.

I went today to my therapist and she suggested I tell my family about everything that happened and maybe that will make me not go back to him once everyone knows the whole 
truth. I know my parents aren't going to let him come to family events or anything like that after I told them what happened. well telling them did not go well, they seemed like they were pissed at me , I don't have the best relationship with them , but I did not expect it to go the way it went. didn't blatantly say this , but was asked what I did to piss him off before he got physically. I grabbed my keys and left sobbing. for almost 2 years mike has always been my person, I could go to him about anything and I felt comfortable crying with him, which i do with very few people.
  it took everything in me to not call him after the interaction with my parents. but the way he was talking this morning, I don't think he would have answered and then I'd feel even more broken. 

ive just never felt more alone than I do right now. I feel like my heart is being ripped out and there's nothing I can do about it. I saw such a future with him and it makes me sick to think of him not being in my life. he was my person and now everyone expects me to cut him out of my life. and they aren't wrong, but it's not that easy. if it was i would have left months ago. 

Please be kind with comments,  I don't even know what to think, i feel like my whole world has been flipped. ",1,1737763777.0,Advice,0,0.99,False
1i9a3u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1i9a3u5/my_incest_cat_has_neurological_problems_that/,my incest cat has neurological problems that cause him to be the literal bane of my existence and i cannot take it any more,"
on my birthday in August of 2023, i was walking to my car in my apartment complex to go visit my parents when my ex noticed this little tiny black cat with crusty eyeballs sitting on the sidewalk. at the time, i already had a cat, my sweet old lady Sugar, whom i had adopted at 8 years old while i was in undergrad; she and i were very content with our new life in a new apartment after i had graduated, and while i had always thought about maybe getting another cat, i would always remember the woman working at the cat cafe i bought Sugar from telling me that she was glad Sugar would ""get to live out her golden years in an only-cat household"" and as an ""ESA"" (i use this term loosely bc in reality i am *her* ESA, but that's neither here nor there).

when he saw this little cat, my ex, who was visiting me for the weekend at the time, immediately crouched down and beckoned the kitten over, who of course scampered right over to him. said ex was ecstatic, as he said he 'had always wanted a black cat,' and i could see that the kitten was visibly weak and sick, so, against my better judgement, i sighed and told my him to scoop him up and bring him inside.

i immediately got this little guy set up in the bath tub with an extra litter box, Sugar's old carrier, towels, food, and water. judging by the size of him, he was about a month old when we found him, and possibly the runt of the litter. we took him to the vet the next morning, where they gave him medication for the mild upper respiratory infection he had, and eventually we could bring him back for his shots. 

his eyes were blue, as all kittens are, and he was found on my birthday, a 'new blue moon,' so we decided to name him Bleu (like the cheese because every animal i own is food themed xoxo). my ex ended up leaving that sunday as planned, and of course couldn't take his new, beloved cat with him (as he was/is literally still living with his parents), so there i was, stuck with a 1-month-old kitten and an 11-year-old cat. we ended up breaking up literally two months later - if that - and no, i have never once received a child support check </3

the first few months were as expected, he was a crazy little kitty with a lot of energy - but he was initially too small to do too much damage. he stayed in the bath tub/bathroom for the first month or so, as he had to be treated for fleas and i wanted Sugar to be properly introduced to him. as time went on and he began to grow, he could soon jump out of the bath tub on his own. eventually he was traversing the couch, the coffee table, and finally, the kitchen counter. he was nefarious at best, but this was something i attributed to his kittenhood; i convinced myself that maybe he would grow out of it.

he did not. i have had this cat for over a year now (Aug 2023-Jan 2025), and as much as i have wanted to give him to another family or even just drop him off at the humane society, i haven't been able to bring myself to do so because he LITERALLY thinks i am his cat mom. as obnoxious and just flat out bad he is, i could never do it (i even made him a profile on an adoption website that i could never bring myself to actually publish).

it has gotten to a point where i just don't know what to do anymore. NOTHING is safe from him, no matter where is it placed or how well it is hidden or how many times it is wrapped - he will get to it and he will most likely try to eat it. as much as i want to say that this is just his personality as a black cat, i truly do think that there are neurological issues at play here. in doing research, i found that it seems like he has some sort of early onset cat dementia; he is CONSTANTLY making noise, chirping, meowing at nothing/everything, and screaming for food. he went through a phase where he would just pee on the couch whenever he pleased (for a while i couldn't tell if it was behavioral or if he literally just could not control his bladder). he is consistently hunting Sugar the cat, pouncing on her when she least expects it (aka all the time bc she is so oblivious) and taking out chunks of her fur. my current gf has come home and found him wrapped up in string lights, literally hanging from his neck (standing on two paws on the ground, but still) after trying to eat Sugar's food. 

to further my point, here’s a list of questionable things he does that i can think of off the top of my head:

* he doesn’t know he has a tail. for probably the first year of his life his tail would just drag behind him, limply. if it were accidentally caught in something or stepped on, he had absolutely no reaction. sometimes we’d find him chasing his tail like it wasn’t attached to him. now he will at least lift it slightly when playing 
* he has been found with an ENTIRE, WRAPPED baguette in the litter box with him after being left alone with it on the counter for approximately 12 minutes. he ate approx 1/4 of it in that time
* we have found whole onions in the litter box on two separate occasions. bro is literally trying to poison himself
* he has ripped into multiple bags of perler beads overnight and trailed them all around the apartment. we were cleaning perlers out of the litter box for days before just dumping it
* to this day, he does not know how to properly clean himself. on top of this, he also cannot use the litter box properly without getting used, wet, clumpy litter CAKED onto him (usually the same back foot), which in turns gets tracked everywhere. it gets to the point where i will have to wipe him down after using the box because there is litter embedded in his paw/leg fur. i sweep at least once a day and, if it was plausible, i would after every time he uses it. 

i really think that because of where he came from he was most likely born from incest, as it seems like many of the cats roaming around my complex are (i’ve always seen the same few cats/kittens ever since moving in). this is the best explanation i can come up with because he is literally anything other than a normal cat. 

sadly, i am truly at the end of my rope. it’s extremely stressful leaving him home alone knowing that anything could be broken, Sugar could be getting tortured, or he could simply be dead after doing some dumb shit. as a last resort, i currently have a big “play cage” coming in the mail as i type this. i feel really defeated, but i just can’t have him free roaming with Sugar when no one is home or while we are asleep.

all this is to say, **does anyone else have a cat similar to my stupid bleu guy?** what do i do with this dodo to make his and our lives easier? IS there anything i can do other than crate him when unsupervised? at the end of the day, i am most concerned about Sugar and her happiness/wellbeing during her old age.

ty for reading if you got this far lol much love to you and your pets! i’ll post any updates on whether or not the crate situation ends up working out, but i have quite a strong feeling he will be screaming every minute he is in it <3

UPDATE: about to finally post this novel, but just wanted to say that the crate has been built and honestly, he seems to kinda like it in there! i'm at work right now, but my gf just got home and said that he seems okay in there still!! lfg ",1,1737763755.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
1i9a3m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1i9a3m0/the_reflection/,THE REFLECTION,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

1i9a399,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1i9a399/vyvanse_unexpectedly_weak_effects/,Vyvanse: Unexpectedly Weak Effects,"I'm in my mid-20s, a student living in Europe and was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago. Since then, I've tried a number of treatments, including Elvanse (known as Vyvanse in the US), which I've taken up to the maximum dose of 70mg, and even accidentally took 140mg once. I'd like to share my experience and would be very interested to know if anyone else has had similar experiences?

**Vyvanse (Lisdexamphetamine aka. LDX) – My Experiences:**

* **Weak effect compared to methylphenidate:** Compared to Methylphenidate, I found the effects of Vyvanse to be very mild, even at high doses. It was comparable to a strong coffee or black tea.
* **Improved mental focus:** LDX helped me to concentrate better on one thing and to reduce the 'mental clutter' in my head.
* **Insufficient effect on inner restlessness:** Although my mental concentration improved, the inner restlessness that constantly drives me to move remained. I wasn't more fidgety than usual and didn't feel the need to exercise excessively, but to others I seemed just as restless as I had been without the medication.
* **Long-lasting effect, but difficulty getting up:** The effects of LDX lasted all day. However, I had extreme difficulty getting up in the morning. If I didn't have the dose right next to my bed, I often overslept and even dreamt of getting up and taking the medicine, only to realise that it was still next to me.
* **Suspected inadequate metabolism:** I suspect that Lisdexamphetamine was not sufficiently converted to the active d-amphetamine in my body. This may be related to my recurrent anaemia (iron deficiency) as I regularly take iron supplements. Could this be related to red blood cell problems?



**Comparison with Methylphenidate (MPH having a overall very much more noticable affect):**

* **I feel less anxious and more relaxed:** When I start taking it, I feel less anxious and more relaxed.

* **Improved reading and concentration:** My eyesight is sharper when I read and I understand the content immediately without having to reread paragraphs. I can concentrate for hours without being distracted by the urge to move.

* **Positive effects on social interactions:** Both Methylphenidate and Vyvanse have helped me in social situations. I feel less introverted and can interact normally with others without being socially awkward. I can even study productively in groups and participate in conversations at the same time.



**Open questions and search for similar experiences:**

Adderall is not available in Europe, but it is possible to get a prescription for Dextroamphetamine or a D/L-amphetamine mix. I would like to try that. However, my main question is whether anyone has had similar experiences with Vyvanse, especially regarding the weak effect compared to Methylphenidate and possible links with anaemia or red blood cell problems. I haven't been able to find any information on this in studies or publications, but there seem to be reports from others where Vyvanse doesn't work as well as it should and they also suffer from anaemia.

I am grateful for any input and shared experiences!",2,1737763710.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1i9a2wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1i9a2wg/the_reflection/,The Reflection,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

1i9a28g,https://i.redd.it/pl2zynbg71fe1.jpeg,Timemore S3 Review,"Received my new Timemore S3 from aliexpress all in costing me around £77. 

I have been using a timemore C2 and thanks to some very helpful redditors was given some good upgrade advice.

Build Quality- 9.5/10: Feels absolutely excellent, very solid throughout and by no means light so not something I'd want to travel with, but for home use (which this exclusively is) it is perfect.

The inside of the grinder looks really nice too, there is a very cool red bearing visible at the top when you load the beans and the burrs are visible and they look much beefier than the C2s because they are.

The handle feels solid, and similar to the C2 it folds which I love. The bottom of the grinder is not magnetic but screws in/out and also has rubber on it so it sticks nicely to the surface. 

Adjustability-9/10: Very nice and easy to adjust external click mechanism with red marker to signify the position. Has wide range of clicks, I'm only using it for pour over on setting 5.5 at present. If I'm being really picky it is slightly hard to read the number of clicks you're on, but it's really not that bad.

Ease of use- 9/10: Very easy to use as are most high quality hand grinders. This timemore S3 grinds 15g of coffee beans very quickly at pourover setting 5.5, we're taking roughly 15-20 seconds it's insane.

One small thing I've noticed is I need to RDT the coffee beans slightly otherwise I get a fair bit of static buildup around the catch cup and bottom of the grinder, but this may be more to do with my environment rather than the grinder itself.

Grind Uniformity-10/10: So far I can't fault it grinding on a fairly fine setting for pourover the grind uniformity is excellent and way above my C2. There are minimal fines, but I'm fine with that and it's expected.
 I have heard this grinder is not ideal for espresso but I don't brew espresso so can't comment on this. 

Taste on V60 and Kalita Wave- 9.5/10: I'm not expert on this but this S3 definitely opens up more flavour, clarity and sweetness compared to the C2. So far it doesn't feel significantly different, but the flavour is very well rounded and full bodied which I personally love.

I have only tried this grinder with medium roast Brazillian coffee beans so far so take this as you will. 

Overall Impression: Extremely happy with this grinder it looks and feels very premium and is most likely my end game grinder for pourover for me personally. 

Buying it off aliexpress made me a bit nervous but it came fairly swiftly and I saved a lot of money compared to buying it off amazon so happy days. 

I would highly recommend this grinder to anyone looking for a ""mid range"" pourover grinder. If you're looking for a grinder which also does espresso it might be worth broadening your horizons though. 

Thanks for reading my review 😀.

Does anyone have any good resources for reading about cold pressing?

When I google I can only find stuff on Cold Brew coffee which is not want I want at all.

Firstly, there was a queue all the way out the door with a sign saying up to 6 hour wait to see a doctor & 2-3 hours just for the nurse triage - okay have to suck it up because he could have a broken arm. 

Once we give details etc we sit & the waiting room is standing room only. There’s probably 200 people in there. 

Now, I don’t want this to turn into an anti-immigration thread or anything like that, but there was honestly, maybe only 20 English people in the waiting room. 

Not an issue, everyone is welcome & entitled to care etc BUT - most of the people of Asian seeming backgrounds, seemingly had their entire family with them? Taking up the entire waiting room. 

There was one couple with 4 kids, and two other adults with them. Having coffees, going out to smoke, chatting & watching stuff on their phones etc. 

Lots of others in groups of 4+ too. 

Now, my issue is - of everyone in that waiting room - only 2/3 people seemed to have had an actual accident & none seemed in a state of emergency. 

I was always brought up knowing it was a stretched service and to only go up there in an actual emergency or after an accident. 

Why/how is it allowed that so many people seem to be up there just hanging around maybe feeling unwell? 

A couple told us they’d been waiting 7 hours, were sitting laughing & joking, watching TikTok, smoking, eating, play fighting…and when we got seen within 40 minutes they got annoyed!? Yes because he’s been in an actual accident and needs urgent care. 

I know it’s largely in part to nobody being able to see a GP, so people are just sitting up there all day to get seen - but surely there should be a separate service for that & leave the A&E for actual emergencies? ",1,1737763444.0,AskUK,20,0.57,False

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1737763245.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Hey, language learners! I've had my fair share of teaching Italian, and let me tell you, explaining **time expressions** is a bit like trying to herd cats. It's all over the place, but when it clicks, it's magic!

**The power of adverbs**

Just like in English, Italian uses adverbs to give a **temporal context**. Picture this: you're chatting with a friend, and you want to tell them about your weekend plans. You'd say something like, ""I'm going to the beach *domani*"" (tomorrow). Easy peasy, right?

**Days of the week**

Now, let's talk about the days of the week. They're not just nouns, they're your trusty sidekicks for planning! Imagine you're setting up a coffee date. You'd say, ""Let's meet *lunedì*,"" and boom, you've got your temporal context sorted.

**Prepositions: *tra*, *fa*, and *in***

Here's where it gets a bit tricky. Italian prepositions are like those friends who can wear multiple hats. Take *tra* and *fra*—they mean ""in"" when talking about future events. So, if your friend asks when you're leaving, you might say, ""I'm heading out *tra* due giorni"" (in two days).

On the flip side, *fa* is your go-to for past events. Picture this: you're reminiscing about that epic concert you went to. You'd say, ""It happened due settimane *fa*"" (two weeks ago).

And then there's *in*, which is all about **duration**. If you finished a book *in* due giorni (in two days), you're basically a reading superhero!

**Let's chat!**

I’m 19 weeks pregnant and still at full time work for now. I used to have quite a bit of caffeine before becoming pregnant and immediately cut out all energy drinks and stuck to 1 instant coffee before work per day to wake me up and 1 soda based drink with dinner. So I’m definitely under the recommendation of caffeine per day. Today I had a cup of instant coffee and whilst at work my co worker offered to buy me a coffee on our break, I didn’t think much of it as it was only 1 extra cup and people seem to drink way more caffeine then I am. But after drinking it 2 hours later I couldn’t stop shaking and ended up in hospital with heart palpitations I thought it was a coincidence and all my results came back normal. I’ve ended up researching the brand of coffee this cafe uses and it’s double the caffeine of normal coffee shops and it wasn’t even advertised. So what I thought was 50mg-100mg was a whopping 250mg. I felt disgusted in myself for not checking beforehand and so stupid to think all coffee brands have the same amount of caffeine. It’s a lesson learnt and after a few hours of rest I feel a lot less shaky. I’m super worried I’ve put my baby at risk for not reading more into it at the time. Now I’m panicking that bubba was under all the stress and I’ve accidentally overdosed. It’s made me want to give up caffeine for good. I feel so awful and I wouldn’t forgive myself if anything happens to my baby. ",1,1737763127.0,pregnant,7,1.0,False

# Introduction

Selling on Amazon can be a game-changer for your business, but only if people actually see your products. Getting more clicks on your Amazon listings is crucial. It's what drives sales and helps your business grow. With millions of products on Amazon, standing out is tough. You need smart strategies to grab shoppers' attention and get them to click on your listings.

# 1. Understanding Amazon's Ecosystem

# Amazon as a Search Engine

Think of Amazon as Google, but for shopping. When people want to buy something, they often start their search on Amazon. They type in what they're looking for, and Amazon shows them a bunch of products that match.

Here's the thing: Amazon tries to show shoppers the products they're most likely to buy. It looks at the words people use to search and tries to find products that match those words. It also considers how well products have sold in the past and how happy customers were with them.

# A9 Algorithm Basics

Amazon uses something called the A9 algorithm to decide which products to show first in search results. It's like a recipe with different ingredients:

* Keywords: The words in your product title and description
* Sales history: How well your product has sold before
* Customer reviews: What people say about your product
* Price: How your price compares to similar products
* Stock levels: Whether your product is available to ship

The A9 algorithm mixes all these factors to rank products. If you can nail these elements, you've got a better shot at showing up higher in search results.

# 2. Optimizing Product Listings

# Title Optimization

Your product title is like a headline. It needs to grab attention and tell shoppers exactly what you're selling. Here's how to make it work:

* Put your most important keywords first
* Keep it under 200 characters
* Make it easy to read – use spaces and capitalize the first letter of each word
* Include key details like brand, product type, color, size, or quantity

For example, instead of ""Blue T-Shirt"", try ""Men's Cotton V-Neck T-Shirt, Blue, Large, Pack of 3"".

# Bullet Points and Descriptions

Bullet points are your chance to quickly show why your product is awesome. Focus on benefits, not just features. Instead of ""100% cotton"", say ""100% cotton for all-day comfort"".

In your product description, tell a story. Help shoppers imagine using your product. If you're selling a coffee maker, describe the perfect morning brew it can create. Use natural language and sprinkle in keywords without overdoing it.

# Images and Videos

Great photos can make or break your listing. Use high-quality images that show your product from different angles. Include lifestyle shots of people using your product. If you can, add a video. It helps shoppers get a better feel for what you're selling.

Remember, Amazon has rules about images. Your main image should show the product on a plain white background. No text or extras in that first photo.

# Pricing Strategies

Price matters a lot on Amazon. If your price is way higher than similar products, fewer people will click. But don't just race to the bottom. Instead:

* Check competitor prices regularly
* Use repricing tools to stay competitive
* Offer bundle deals to increase value
* Use Lightning Deals or coupons to attract bargain hunters

# 3. Leveraging Organic Traffic

# Keyword Research

Finding the right keywords is like striking gold. You want words that lots of people search for, but not too many other sellers are using. Here's how to find them:

* Use Amazon's search bar suggestions
* Look at competitor listings
* Try tools like Helium 10's Magnet to find high-volume, low-competition keywords

# Backend Search Terms

Amazon lets you add ""hidden"" keywords in the backend of your listing. These don't show up to customers but help Amazon's search engine find your product. Use this space for:

* Common misspellings
* Related terms
* Synonyms

Don't repeat words or use competitor brand names here. It's against Amazon's rules and could get you in trouble.

# Amazon SEO Best Practices

To rank well on Amazon:

* Use your main keywords in your title, bullet points, and description
* Keep your content relevant and helpful
* Update your listings regularly with fresh content
* Encourage customer reviews (the right way – no bribes or manipulation)

# Customer Reviews and Ratings

Good reviews do more than make you feel good. They help your products show up higher in search results and make people more likely to buy. To get more reviews:

* Use Amazon's ""Request a Review"" button
* Provide great customer service
* Follow up with buyers (within Amazon's rules)
* Make sure your product description is accurate to avoid disappointed customers

# 4. Driving External Traffic

# Social Media Marketing

Social media can be a powerful way to send people to your Amazon listings. Here's how to make it work:

* Share eye-catching photos and videos of your products
* Tell stories about how your products solve problems
* Use hashtags to reach people interested in your niche
* Run contests or giveaways (following Amazon's rules)

On platforms like Instagram and TikTok, short, fun videos can really grab attention. Show your product in action or share quick tips related to your niche.

# Google Ads and PPC Campaigns

Google Ads can help you reach people who are ready to buy. Here's a quick guide:

1. Set up a campaign targeting keywords related to your product
2. Create ads that highlight what makes your product special
3. Send people directly to your Amazon listing
4. Track which keywords bring sales and focus on those

Remember, you're paying for each click, so make sure your listing is top-notch to convert those visitors into buyers.

# Email Marketing

If you have an email list, use it! Let your subscribers know when you launch new products or have special offers. But don't just sell – share helpful content too. Maybe tips on using your products or industry news. This keeps people engaged and more likely to buy when you do promote something.

# Influencer Partnerships

Working with influencers can get your products in front of new audiences. Look for influencers who align with your brand and have engaged followers. It's not always about finding the biggest names – sometimes smaller, niche influencers can drive more targeted traffic.

# 5. Running Amazon Advertising

# Sponsored Products Ads

Sponsored Products are ads that appear in Amazon search results and on product pages. They're a great way to boost visibility for new or underperforming products. Here's how to make them work:

1. Start with automatic targeting to see which searches trigger your ads
2. Use that data to create manual campaigns with specific keywords
3. Adjust your bids based on performance – spend more on keywords that drive sales
4. Use negative keywords to avoid wasting money on irrelevant clicks

# Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Display Ads

Sponsored Brands let you showcase your brand and multiple products in one ad. They appear at the top of search results, making them great for brand awareness.

Sponsored Display Ads can appear on and off Amazon, including on competitor product pages. They're good for retargeting shoppers who've viewed your products but didn't buy.

For both ad types:

* Use clear, attractive images
* Write compelling headlines that highlight your unique selling points
* Test different versions to see what works best

# Amazon DSP (Demand-Side Platform)

For bigger sellers, Amazon DSP offers more advanced advertising options. You can reach shoppers on and off Amazon, including on popular websites and apps. It's powerful but complex – consider working with an agency or experienced marketer if you want to try DSP.

# 6. Building Brand Awareness

# Amazon Brand Registry

Enrolling in Brand Registry gives you access to more tools to promote your brand on Amazon. It helps protect your brand from copycats and unlocks features like Enhanced Brand Content and Amazon Stores.

# Enhanced Brand Content (EBC/A+ Content)

EBC (also called A+ Content) lets you add more images and text to your product pages. You can:

* Tell your brand story
* Explain product features in more detail
* Compare different products in your line

This extra content can help convince shoppers to buy and can improve your search rankings.

# Amazon Stores

An Amazon Store is like having your own mini-website within Amazon. You can:

* Showcase all your products in one place
* Create a branded shopping experience
* Use custom URLs to drive traffic directly to your store

A well-designed Store can boost brand loyalty and make shoppers more likely to buy multiple products from you.

# 7. Analyzing Traffic Data and Metrics

# Amazon Seller Central Reports

Amazon gives you lots of data about your listings. Pay attention to:

* Search terms report: See which keywords are bringing you sales
* Detail page views: How many people are seeing your listings
* Unit session percentage: How many views turn into sales

Use this data to spot trends and improve your listings.

# Key Metrics to Track

Focus on these numbers:

* Conversion rate: The percentage of page views that turn into sales
* Click-through rate (CTR): How often people click on your listing when they see it in search results
* Impressions: How many times your listing shows up in search results

If your CTR is low, your title or main image might need work. If impressions are low, you might need to improve your keywords.

# Testing and Iteration

Always be testing! Try different:

* Titles
* Main images
* Pricing
* Bullet points

Make one change at a time and give it a week or two to see the results. Keep what works, change what doesn't.

# 8. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

# Keyword Stuffing

Don't cram your listing full of keywords. It looks spammy and can turn off potential buyers. Use keywords naturally in your title and description.

# Ignoring Mobile Optimization

More and more people shop on their phones. Make sure your images look good on small screens and your bullets are easy to read. Keep sentences short and break up text into small paragraphs.

# Neglecting Customer Feedback

Bad reviews can tank your sales. Address customer concerns quickly. If you see a pattern in complaints, fix the issue. Good customer service can turn a negative review into a positive one.

# 9. Introducing Helium 10

# Why Helium 10 Is a Game-Changer

Helium 10 is like a Swiss Army knife for Amazon sellers. It's packed with tools that can help you find profitable products, optimize your listings, and boost your sales.

# Highlighting Keyword Research Tools

Most days I went out of my way to get two espressos while I was out. I was staying near the Gaslamp district and stuck near the touristy spots, so that's definitely reflected in my choices (especially considering I didn't want to rent a car). I also fear the list is basic because I got all of my suggestions from Reddit haha.

Favorites:

• Bird Rock: I had 3 espressos at the location near the Maritime Museum, 2x single-origin and 1x the house blend (the Monkey Bite) and each one REALLY impressed me. I wish I knew what beans they used for that first single-origin I had (they swap out their beans regularly), the second one was Bombe Natural which although was flavorful was just a little too sweet for me!

• Goldchild Coffee Roasters: These are people who *really* care about their espresso! It's not only the actual cup of coffee (which is fantastic) but the staff, ambience, decor... definitely worth a visit or two!

• Mnemonic Coffee: People rave about Mnemonic online and I think it is worth the hype! The staff were also super pleasant, if you're around Balboa Park you need to visit just be aware they have slightly more limited hours than other places.

• Bonjour Patisserie: I only ended up here because I wanted to go to a bakery but their espresso really surprised me.

• Scoops La Jolla: They use Bird Rock beans!

• Iconic Coffee Club: Just down the street from Mnemonic, I stopped in because Mnemonic was closed and this spot is definitely worth a look! There isn't much seating but despite that this spot had a really great atmosphere.

• Bay Books in Coronado: Fun to visit on account of it being a bookstore and the staff were really friendly and passionate about books.

Off the top of my head I visited at least 12 places and these are the ones that stood out to me. The only genuinely bad espresso I had was at the zoo... but it's the zoo and I only really needed caffeine then. Overall, I had a great time in San Diego.

Since then it has grown, fairly modestly, but it has lost some of the “real neighborhood” elements like the laundry mat. 
It had a couple of restaurants, a small grocery called Fresh Plus that Bestway reminds me of, an ice cream/coffee/liquor place and a couple of funky shops. 

I wonder sometimes what The Corner will become. It’s been unchanged in the 6 years we’ve lived here and I kind of hope it stays that way. I’d welcome a couple more businesses but not too many and not so “hipster” as to change the neighborhood feel of the place. ",1,1737762958.0,gso,8,0.67,False

I'm resisting the urge to upgrade anything else for a while - figure I should hone my technique before I jump into the world of bottomless portafilters, precision baskets, and all the other silly toys that you see on YouTube.

For now I'm sticking to basic WDT and those puck screen seem to be too thick to use with the stock double basket using 16g. Short term, they just look pretty, long term, just help to keep the group head cleaner.

1i99jht,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1i99jht/positive_dealership_experiences/,Positive Dealership Experiences,"I know the norm here & elsewhere online is for car buyers to post about their negative dealership experiences. There's a ton of youtube videos & even other sub-reddits bashing dealerships and car salespeople

However, as someone who grew up in a car sales family (my father has sold cars for 40 years and my brother has sold cars for almost 20 years) I know that not all car salespeople are bad. Indeed the majority are normal average people who're just trying to earn their daily bread

So I want to counter the negativity spewed by others with positivity. If you've had a positive dealership car buying experience or just any positive dealership experience, please share it below in the comment section

I'll start by sharing two positive dealership experiences that I've had very recently

1. Just in the past week, I helped my neighbor buy a very high demand low supply vehicle i.e brand new gasoline 2025 Toyota Corolla LE sedan in the highly sought after Celestite exterior and black interior color combo (because it's low maintenance and aesthetic). We live in Houston but dealership is in Spring. The dealership initially quoted $32k OTD but after I aggressively negotiated on my neighbor's behalf, they brought the price down to $27.5k OTD. This includes floor mats, tints, and mud guards. They also agreed to deliver the car to my neighbor and the dealership is an hour away. The dealership even ate the $150 credit card processing fee so that my neighbor can earn $55 cash back by making a $5000 deposit by credit card. I know the dealership didn't make much profit, especially since my neighbor paid cash, bought no extended warranties, and no trade in. Yet both the salesman and finance manager were friendly and not pushy. My neighbor conducted his entire car buying experience from the comfort of his home, not even one visit to the dealership! No test drive, just leave it up to Jesus! He was worried because he wired a huge sum of money to the dealership before getting the car but the dealership confirmed in the end they received it! 

  
2. Recently, I helped my friend buy a brand new fully loaded top trim 2024 Nissan Versa SR. The car had $3000 in accessories and an OTD asking price of $26,000. I negotiated the price down to $21,000 OTD and the dealership agreed as long as my friend financed with them, which he did. So he received a fantastic deal! On top of that, the Nissan dealership treated my friend and myself like we were Kings! Premium coffee, delicious snacks, and chilled mineral water gratis at the lounge area! Free tank of gas and another free tank as long as my friend returned in a few weeks and did the manufacturer survey with the salesman.  Free pen and keychain! Everyone from the salesman to the sales manager was friendly! The finance manager became cold when we refused all the extended warranties but that's to be expected from finance managers. Everyone was cheering us on and congratulating us on our smart purchase! We both left with huge smiles on our faces and drove away into the sunlight in a fancy shiny new Versa with tons of luxury features that even a Mercedes Benz wouldn't have 20 years ago! 

Now your turn. Please share your positive experiences! ",2,1737762150.0,askcarsales,10,1.0,False
1i99j8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i99j8w/culver_streets_trash_bins_are_always_empty_this/,Culver Street's trash bins are always empty. This terrifies me.,"I never paid much attention to garbage trucks. They’re like punctuation marks in the long, messy sentence of urban life. Always there, always unnoticed. But I live on Culver Street, and if you live here, you know one thing: no garbage trucks pass. Ever. Not once in the three years I’ve lived here.

It wasn’t a problem at first. Culver Street isn’t exactly the heart of civilization—more like its left lung, full of stale air and waiting for a good purge. There are only six houses, all set back far enough from the cracked asphalt to feel disconnected from one another. No sidewalks, no streetlights, just a stretch of road that curves into trees so thick they swallow the horizon.

The thing is, my trash bins are always empty.

Not empty in the “I forgot to put them out” kind of way. Empty like: I drop a bag of egg shells, coffee grounds, and leftover takeout into the bin at night, and by morning, it’s gone. Not a trace. No smell, no liner smeared with grease or crumbs. The bags disappear. Every single time.

At first, I figured it was some weird service the landlord never told me about. An eccentric, off-the-books operation. Culver Street vibes like that—quiet, private, no questions asked. But when I brought it up to the neighbors, they all looked at me like I’d confessed to killing their dog.

“You’re not supposed to talk about it,” said Martha, who lives in the blue house at the end of the road. She spoke like someone testing a loose tooth, afraid to apply too much pressure. “The less you notice, the better.”

“Notice what?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Just walked back inside, muttering something about “rules.”

That’s when I started digging around. I called the city’s waste management office to ask why garbage trucks didn’t service Culver Street. The woman on the line paused for so long I thought we’d been disconnected.

“Culver Street, you said?”

“Yes.”

She cleared her throat. “That’s, um, outside of our service area.”

“Outside your service area? But it’s in the middle of the city.”

“It’s… complicated.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, like she was worried someone might overhear. “Listen, if you’re getting your trash taken care of, just leave it alone, okay?”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

But she hung up before I could get an answer.

I should’ve stopped there. Everyone told me to stop, even the guy at the library who helped me dig up old zoning records. He handed over the map without looking me in the eye and muttered, “You’re not gonna like what you find.”

The map was weird. Culver Street was there, but it was shaded differently, almost like it wasn’t supposed to exist. The zoning codes didn’t match the surrounding area, and there was a note scrawled in the margins: “Do not service – 1978.”

I dug deeper. Found old newspaper clippings about garbage workers refusing to enter the street after three of them went missing back in the ’70s. No bodies, no truck, no nothing. Just gone. The city blamed a sinkhole, but nothing was ever found. They rerouted the trucks after that, and Culver Street was officially marked as “off-limits.”

One of the articles mentioned that a group of residents petitioned the city to resume collection services in the ’90s. The city sent an investigator to assess the situation, but he disappeared too. The petition died. So did the story.

It wasn’t just the city, either. A woman named Carla tried to report what was happening to her trash to the police in 2002. She claimed she saw “something” in the street one night, something that took the garbage but wasn’t human. The cops wrote her off as crazy. She moved away a week later.

I thought about moving, too. But Culver Street does this thing to you—it pulls you in. You start to feel like you’re part of it, like leaving would be some kind of betrayal.

Then the dreams started.

They were always the same. I’d wake up at 3:00 a.m. to the sound of wheels scraping pavement, but when I looked out the window, the street was empty. Except for the shadow.

It wasn’t shaped like a truck. Or a person. It was just… wrong. Like a smear of oil on the fabric of reality, sliding soundlessly past my house.

The next day, I’d find my trash bins sparkling clean, as if nothing could ever stick to them.

This went on for weeks. I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating properly. My house felt wrong, like it was pressing against me from all sides. One night, I decided I had to know.

I stayed up, sitting in the darkened living room with the curtains pulled back just enough to give me a sliver of a view. At 3:07 a.m., I heard it—the scrape of wheels.

The street was empty.

No, not empty.

The shadow was there, oozing up the road. It didn’t glide or roll; it moved. Like it was alive. I couldn’t make out its shape, but I swear it had eyes. Not glowing or anything dramatic, just dark holes that locked onto me the second I looked.

I froze. It stopped.

And then, slowly, it moved toward my bins.

There was no sound. No rustling of plastic, no clatter of lids. Just a wrongness that made my teeth ache. The shadow enveloped the bins, and when it pulled away, they were empty. It didn’t take the bags. It took everything else.

I don’t know how I stayed quiet. I don’t know how I stayed sane. When it was gone, I stumbled to bed and didn’t leave for two days.

Now I follow the rules. I don’t look out the window at night. I don’t ask questions. I bag my trash, put it in the bins, and pretend I don’t notice when it’s gone in the morning.

But sometimes, when I’m half-asleep, I hear the scrape of wheels. And I wonder: what happens if it decides I’m trash too?",9,1737762130.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

February 2nd, 1973. 35,000 feet in the air. 20 miles northwest of Sydney. 4 miles off the coast. In this position were two F-14A Tomcats from US Naval Squadron 181, nicknamed Jolly Roger.

Inside the lead aircraft a pilot named Lieutenant Santana was flying. On his helmet was a decorated version of his callsign, Greenhawk. On the dashboard was a black and white photograph of his wife and son.

The joint Japanese-American invasion of Australia was happening. This was it. The final campaign of the Second Great War. Santana was on standby waiting for orders.

Finally the orders came. “Greenhawk, this is Nimitz command, we have received word that Australian armored reinforcements are moving to assault Marine positions, are you able to take them out?”

Santana replied, “Yes, I can, over.”

“Roger, coordinates are...”

Greenhawk tuned out the coordinates as he had noticed an unidentified aircraft approach on radar. “Uh, Nimitz Command, this is Greenhawk, I’ve got 3 boogies on my three, over.”

“Roger that Greenhawk, checking if they're friendly or hostile, over.”

Unfortunately for Santana he would get his answer before Nimitz Command could respond. Two missiles slammed into his wing mate and then his plane before either could respond.

The F-14 barreled towards the ocean, Santana unconscious and unable to eject.

Just before it hit the ocean the pilot woke up, took one last look at the picture of his wife and said, “I’m sorry Maria.”

Then the aircraft slammed into the water.

**Introduction**

51 Years later. At North Rooseveltville High School. 7: 51 AM. Just before the start of school.

Sue Williams was sitting in her seat, looking around. For the first time ever everyone had shown up before the bell rang. The only expectation was the teacher, Mr. Santana. Who was presumably getting coffee. On his desk was an old and visibly beat up fighter pilot helmet with “Greenhawk” on it.

Sue looked up at the wall, seeing the clock and the portraits of the “Great Four” presidents. George Washington. Abraham Lincoln. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Robert F Kennedy. There was also a portrait of the current president, Joe Kennedy III. These portraits were required by law.

Sue turned her attention to the rest of her classmates. Mike and Lucy were making out in the back of the classroom. Daisy was browsing her phone. Paulo was watching gay porn on his phone...

The door then opened and Mr. Santana walked in, a coffee in his hands, and sat down at his desk.

Two minutes later, the bell rang signaling the start of class. They went through the standard motions, the pledge of allegiance, the principal gave out some announcements over the intercom, and the teacher took attendance.

Once Mr. Santana had finished taking attendance, he stood up and with a solemn look on his aged face, cleared his throat. Speaking with authority he said, “Good morning everyone and welcome back from Thanksgiving Break, hope everyone had a good time.”

With the pleasantries out of the way the teacher switched topics. “For the last three weeks before midterms we will be studying the Second Great War. This war was without a doubt the largest and most consequential in Human history, everything since this war has just been an aftershock of this conflict.”

Mr. Santana then picked up the helmet on his desk and lifted it up. “I have a personal connection to this war. My father was a fighter pilot in the US Navy, having fought during the Caribbean, West African, and Irish campaigns...”

He trailed off for a moment as what he was going to say was going to cause much emotional distress to him. “He was one of the 750,000 Americans who did not return home from the war. He was shot down over Australia at the start of the invasion. This helmet was all that was recovered from his plane.”

“Millions of young men like him gave their lives to stop the barbaric ideology known as Fascism and by the end of these three weeks I want you to understand their sacrifice.”

Mr. Santana then sighed and said, “With that out of the way, let's get started.”",1,1737762125.0,AlternateHistory,1,1.0,False

I’m still sad from yesterday. I know I shouldn’t be but I’ve started to realize maybe in my mind he was the last hope I had for getting married. Plus I really liked it when he touched me. And I’m not gonna get touched for a long time unless I get on bumble which I don’t want to do. Cause who wants to date the girl who’s obsessed with some random guy she doesn’t know. 

I feel bad about HA. I feel like I held him back. I didn’t realize it at first but it all makes sense now. All those times he talked about wanting to get into dating again was him baiting me to leave. All the standards. The control. All of it was to get me to leave. But deep down I didn’t want to cause I guess he just felt like safety net for me. I actually thought we’d end up together but he told me we’re incompatible in many ways and I can’t fight that. I don’t have the looks he wants. He wants things in bedroom I don’t want. He’s busy but I need attention. It makes sense. I just still wanted him ig. He was my safety blanket. 

I wonder if he’s gonna read my account anymore. I kinda hope he’s over it and I’m assuming he is cause he wanted me gone. Cause like I don’t want him to come back just cause he found I’m sad and lonely. Or i say the above. 

I don’t know. I just want physical intimacy. And I can’t ask classroom guy for it. I would if I knew there was chance he’d say yes but I know he doesn’t see me like that. Womp womp. 

Gonna do a lot of self care this weekend (rotting in bed) cause I need it. I don’t know. I’m still sad. Classroom guy is gonna leave soon. I just feel it. But at least it’ll get the pain over with. Then I can learn to live without him sooner rather than later. 

I can’t decide if I wanna cut him sooner rather than later. But I’m starting to feel I just bother him. I know he said he likes what we have but maybe he only meant the coffee experience and not our friendship. He left me on delievered for over 12 hours. And he never said when he was free next weekend so I think I’m gonna play it safe and just not mention anything. I don’t know what to do. I’m not ready to lose him but maybe his life would be easier without me. I just feel like I bother him. Like he’s only around to keep me happy. And I don’t want it if it’s that way. I want him to be happy and satisfied and fulfilled. I don’t think I help him feel that. I just am emotional burden I feel like. I know it’s not true and he doesn’t feel this way but I just do. 

I really wanted to talk him today. But he’s been busy. Some part of me hopes he calls but I know he won’t. 

I think I’m just gonna be alone. For the weekend at least. I’m turning on dnd. Speaking of I might turn it back on. No one’s gonna text or call me anyway.

I haven’t weighed it yet—I’ll do that tomorrow—but I wanted to ask the coffee experts here: is it normal to get a 34-second espresso shot at grind setting 38 using a double basket? Isn’t that too long? Shouldn’t that be achievable somewhere around grind setting 4-8?

I’m hesitant to adjust the screw on the tamper due to my previous bad experience with this machine’s tamper, so I’m not sure if I should even touch it. I’ll weigh the dose tomorrow to see if it’s within the recommended 18-22 grams.

My MIL is so nice, but she annoys the ever loving hell out of me. She is for sure a helicopter parent and is entirely too dependent on her son. My partner luckily pushes back and agrees with my concerns, but it is just a constant battle of us vs them to get her and his father to listen.

We all had to go to the embassy before going to the airport for a trip because my partner needed to renew his passport (not a US citizen). She went with him while I ran to get coffee. When I picked them up, she was complaining that they wouldn’t let her go back with him for his appointment. Uh… he’s a nearly 30 year old man. Duh. 

Today, she started talking about how strong the bond is between mother and son. He rolls his eyes at this, but I can’t stand that this woman can’t understand that when your child gets a partner, you’re no longer the most important woman in their lives.

This woman is an incredibly successful businesswoman. She travels internationally for work constantly and has more degrees than I can remember off the top of my head. She’s not helpless. But she doesn’t have many hobbies (that I’m aware of) so she hyper focuses on work and her son. I struggle even more with this because my parents and my stepparents aren’t like this at all. They all have hobbies, jobs, friends, and other kids to focus on. We live away from them and I talk to my dad on the phone about once a week, my mom even less, and then we text maybe a few times a week. I’m super close to them, but we just have a healthy relationship that doesn’t require being on each other’s ass all the time. Meanwhile, partner’s mom calls and texts him multiple times a day, and ignoring her or telling her to stop doesn’t work.

It’s a little all over the place, but I’m just over it. My partner is pretty good about setting boundaries and pushing back, but I can admit he could be better about it. If you have any tips and tricks, I’m all ears.",4,1737761507.0,Mildlynomil,4,0.75,False

i already knew about gallbladder issues before i started having mine bc both my mother and grandmother have had it- my grandmother actually having hers removed.

in the summer of 2024, i had to go to the hospital for a separate issue (being kidney stones) and while i was there they saw in my ultrasound that i had (definitive proof of) gallstones, which i had actually told them about. they proceeded to not say anything about it, considering that's not what i was there for. 
in later months, i had my physical with my family doctor, with whom i told all my struggles of the summer. she basically pulled a ""damn that's crazy"" and didn't say much else about it.

twice now i've had to call off work bc of this horrible debilitating pain, and i know i'm starting to irk my manager because of it- (she knows about it but keeps asking why i don't get it removed, she's had hers removed too). 

so now i have no idea what to do about it. i've heard about patients only having their GB removed if it was an emergency. i've looked up symptoms of emergencies and it basically just describes me everyday SINGLE time i have an attack- so it certainly worries me, bc what if one of these times i wont know it's an emergency?

to end this story for now; (i'm actually in the midst of an attack that has lasted for 6 hours) i've called my family doctor and requested a consultation scheduled for 4 days from now. ",1,1737761342.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

We went to quite a few (probably too many) spots and thought that I'd share our thoughts!

**Family Friend:** Great space, great staff. Really don't understand all the hype surrounding them. The burger was phenomenal (anything is with kewpie mayo) the fried chicken plate was lack-luster and lacking seasoning both in the chicken and sides. It also arrived cold. Corn soup was great but had hardly any chicken. I'd expect ""chicken thighs"" to mean more than 3 cubes of chicken. The buñuelo were really bitter. For the price-point and hype I expected much better. Great burger though. We REALLY didn't appreciate being offered sides of sauces, including ketchup, only to be charged 2 dollars a sauce (.50 for ketchup) come on, work that into the pricing of the already expensive mains 1.5/5

**Saint Bread:** Overall fantastic and the line and hype is deserving. The laminated pastry products were some of the best I've ever tasted. Apple Tahini Danish was a stand-out. Like a sophisticated apple slices with peanut-butter. Loved the flavors and texture of the yuzu pound cake. Matcha white chocolate rice-krispy treat was very well balanced. Baguette sandwich was enjoyable, I loved the radicchio mix you dont normally see. The egg salad sandwich was served on hard bread, like the fridge had dried it out, and had a bit too much nori for my taste. 4.5/5

**Oriental Mart @ Pikes:** We had a few small bites at ""iconic"" Pikes joints and most weren't notable but Oriental Mart's Salmon Sinigang (sour and umami in the best ways possible), Chicken Adobo (falling off the bone) and Longganisa (fat greasy sweet and salty goodness) was some of the best Filipino food we have ever had. Nothing was bad or worth any criticism here. We all loved the vibe and decor as well. 5/5

**Spinasse:** Best restaurant of our trip. Insanely good. We got nearly everything on the menu to share. The stand-outs were the Cipollini ripieni (beef pork stuffed onions) and Risotto with braised oxtail and aged balsamico. Im still thinking about that risotto. Most of the pasta dishes were very thin angel-hair-esque cuts and we only wish there was more shape variety like the agnolotti. only lack-luster items we had were the roasted duck (very very chewy) and beef cheek (too many warming spices, like a big piece of xmas beef). Had a great Negroni there as well. We loved all the desserts like the huckleberry semifreddo and the Zuppa inglese but the chocolate cake is what dreams are made of. This was the one and only ""high-end"" restaurant we dined at where the prices matched the quality and service. We loved how PNW flavors were mixed with good ""true"" Italian food. 4.8/5

**Miss Pho**: Great pho, great service, great vibes. THE BEST Summer Taro Rolls I've had and some of the best pho too. THE BEST SHRIMP TOAST. We loved the addition of the creamy egg in the beef shank Phở Hà Nội. The charred pork was insane. Nearly everything was expertly cooked. We found the fried dumplings to be a bit plain and the salt and pepper tofu to be lacking in the iconic salt and pepper seasoning flavors. 4.8/5

**Beast and Cleaver:** The biggest disappointment of our trip. We were really looking forward to this one and we cant believe how let down we were by the experience. We went for the ""Beastro"" menu offering and got every item listed (other than every cut of meat) and we couldn't believe how homogenous everything that was house-made tasted as well as was presented. We ordered every paté (a basque style, one I cant remember the name of and a pork rillette) and all were presented the same way: really good mustard, very harsh pickled/vinegared apples and super hard crostinis. It would've been really nice to have different pickles or compliments to each paté instead of them all being the same. They, unfortunately, all tasted the same to us as well, flat and not much going on. Our server was just not great at being a server. There seemed to be a vibe shift when they realized we weren't going to order any wine (most of us don't drink wine) and we weren't really aware of the expectation to get wine prior to booking our table. Plates were delivered to our table with no explanations or comments, not many questions asked about how we were doing and very short responses when we did ask a question. Not a very warm or welcoming experience. We asked to stagger our dishes so we could enjoy them (2 hour limit) and were told that wasn't possible because the steaks take 30 minutes to cook, which ended up not being true. All of the sides were aggressively just ok. The kobocha squash was covered in sauces/aoli that was just odd to most of us, the gratin potatoes  had cold spots and lacked seasoning and the endive salad wasn't properly prepared and used some of the funkiest blue cheese (and we all love cheese) making it burn-your-sinuses inedible for us. We ordered the A5 Waygu and Pork Chops. We all love a rare steak, never going above medium rare, we weren't asked how we would like our cuts cooked, only one cut was listed as being served rare, Both cuts arrived blue. I think that the risk of raw pork has been blown out of proportion in American dining culture but this pork hardly had a sear on it and was still below room temp cold in the middle. The kind of rare where you have to keep chewing and chewing. What rubbed us the wrong way about this is that we heard the chef tell the server that he thought the pork chop was too rare and the server said ""nah, dont worry about it they ordered it that way"" no, we absolutely did not. We weren't asked at all how we wanted our cuts prepared. That really bothered all of us at the table. The A5 was A5, its hard to mess that up. Again, too blue for most of our tastes but it was an incredible slice of beef that melted in your mouth and seasoned with a bit too much salt. Both these cuts absolutely didn't take 30 minutes to cook. The dessert was awful. A cross between a classic English Pudding and a Tres Leches. We weren't asked how anything was while we were eating so at the end of our meal we told them to not box up the pork chop because it's simply too rare for us to enjoy. The server took it back to the chef (this is a small space) and he seemed honestly bent about our criticism (we think because the server lied about how we ordered it). We saw him throw the cut up pork slices in the oven for about 5 minutes, box it up and had the server drop it on our table saying he fixed it. We opened it up and it was maybe a degree less rare. We found this a tad passive aggressive especially after saying we weren't interested in taking it home. To add to this, the chef then came to our table and told us that if we wanted a cut cooked a certain way we should've told him how to cook it, we told him our server didn't ask us nor checked on us and what we overhead about us ordering it rare which received a seemingly empty ""hmmmm, ok, sorry"" as he left for the night. I do want to say that the server then informed us that he went ahead and took the pork chop off of our bill and tried to chum up with us at the very end of the night but then commented on bars we had visited  as being pretentious (look at your wine bottles, dude) and not good. A very odd experience. Everything was priced very reasonably and fair but we think they should stick to being a butcher shop. We were hoping there would be more offerings like the ones that they post on their instagram as well as the burger that Beard awarded them for. ""The Beastro"" explanation on their website is just too vague to know what to expect. We didn't get the hype. Maybe The Peasant is better? 2/5

**Ballard Bars:** Most were crazy with the prices (15 dollars for a shot????) but **Percy's & Co. Seattle:** One of the ""pretentious"" bars we went to in Ballard. It was so ""pretentious"" that we saw a bar fight and I got a free shot of Malort. Great innovative cocktails, pricey, but worth it. The matcha and sesame oil one is incredible and I got a great garlic infused gin dirty martini. Josh is THE MAN behind that bar! 4.5/5

**Mean Sandwich:** Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Couldn't believe how warm and welcoming everyone was. The corned beef with slabs of corned beef, cabbage slaw, mint, mustard on a potato bun was the favorite item of the trip. What a unique and delicious combo. We all loved the crispy potatoes and thought that the burger was great too. Great vibes, great people, great humor. We have no criticisms. Loved it 5/5

**Un Bien:** We split up the number 2 between the group and were blown away. Flawless sandwich. The bread had a great chew and the garlic sauce went great with the melt in your mouth pork shoulder and expertly cooked onions. 5/5

**Seawolf**: We had their bread around town and decided to visit their shop. I take issue with their pricing of bread (5-7 dollars for a baguette in their store yet 10 in some shops around town) I have years of bread experience and honestly find their pricing to be unethical, especially for the quality of product but this may be a Seattle pricing thing. Everything was beautiful but nothing was outstanding here. The savory and sweet danish were both good. A butter croissant shouldn't cost as much as a baguette. Good bran muffin. 2/5

**Temple Pastry**: A miss for all of us. We got nearly everything in the case and it just wasn't good or particularly bad. Products listed with big flavors all fell flat and the dough in the laminated products lacked any fermentation complexities. I had high hopes for the shortbreads and all were way too soft. Very pretty products all presented well. Great baguette. 3.5/5

**Coyle's Bakeshop:** Easily the smallest portions in a bakery I have ever been to. The  Kouign-amann was the size of a golf ball and a half. I mean, what the hell? This would be fine if the prices reflected she size or the craft of the product. They didn't. Our millionaire shortbread was missing half of the base of shortbread and they forgot the coconut macaroons we ordered (didn't open the box until we were back to our hotel) The brownie strip was a really odd choice of portioning as well. pretty good canelé and although small, the Kouign-amann was one of the crunchiest I've had in awhile. Great flavors, poor pricing. 2.5/5

**Ben's Bread:** The Best bakery of the trip. Absolutely nothing was bad or mediocre here. All hits. Great English Muffin breakfast sandwich and baguette sandwich. We got nearly everything in the case but what stood out to me the most was: The olive oil cake with whipped cream and cranberry compote, citrus bar with candied citrus, streusel coffee cake, toffee apricot financier and the coconut donut with the coconut cream (best I've ever had) filled donut hole and brioche twist. Ben and his team know what they are doing. Complex yet perfectly balanced sourdough, bold and unique flavors, all praise is well deserved. Great folks, great vibes, great to see the owners in the trenches with their team. 5/5

**Byen Bakery:** Overall ok. Most of the products were dry. The cinnamon roll had great flavors as well as the cardamom bun with coconut vanilla cream. Generous portions. Butterball and fold cookies tasted too much like vegetable shortening. They had a ""mass-produced"" vibe to them 2.8/5

**Bar Del Corso**: Just ok. Nothing really stood out to us. Meatballs had a funk to them we didn't really like, Calabrian sausage was ok, arancini was arancini, table bread was far too sour, mushroom pizza was alright. Nothing was inspired. Good Negroni. 3/5

**Coupe and Flute:** Great vibes, great staff, great drinks not fans of the food. The deviled eggs had wasabi or horseradish in the filling and it was far too much of it, popcorn with butter was $7 dollars for a small bowl and the French Onion soup was pretty good. Super mushy apple crisp. Again, too much hype but I'd go back for a drink. 3.5/5

**Milstead & Co:** We went to a few coffee shops while visiting and this was our favorite. Super friendly staff. The salted caramel latte was insane, life changing insane. Great mocha too. The cute barista complimented my shirt so this gets a 5/5

**Viveeine's Bistro:** Another just ok spot. Nothing was outstanding, nothing was bad. We got fried pork belly that tasted like nutella, funnel cakes and powdered sugar for some reason. We were fans of the toothpick lamb. 3/5

**Communion**: Another huge let-down, offensively so. We were seated 30 minutes past our reservation time which is always a pet peeve of mine especially when we had to put a deposit down for a reservation that has a late/no show charge agreement to it. The staff was very attentive in the beginning , kind and took the time to explain what Communion was about which was appreciated by all of us. The concept behind Communion is unique and inspired. Unfortunately, the food was not. First off, the menu posted on their website, at the time of booking (week before visiting), was not the same menu that was offered that night. Disappointing to not be able to order what we were looking forward to like the pork neck bone soup and banana pudding but fine, we can pivot. To start we ordered the yeast rolls and hoecakes. The yeast roll, because only one is served even though its plural, was totally raw in the middle with a ""whipped"" crab butter that was hard as a rock making it impossible to spread on the bread. The hoecakes tasted great but had bristles from a basting brush all over them. The Hood sushi, we were told was the most popular item, was grocery store sushi tier. Nothing going on at all in that roll, flat, fishy and chewy in a bad way. random pockets of chili or cayenne in some pieces that left some of us with burning tongues and some of us with no heat at all. The grilled okra which was promised to be slime free was full of slime (which im fine with but others in my party were not) due to not being grilled properly. One side of a piece of okra would be totally raw while another side on the same piece was burnt to a crisp. Totally uneven seasoning on the pieces as well. The Big Ass Shrimp were very good but the béarnaise sauce was broken and gritty. The collard greens were cooked perfectly but the turkey cheeks were far too salty. I really wish all the salt in the turkey cheeks went to where it was needed like in the okra. The ""better than your grandma's mac n cheese"" was definitely not better than my grandma's because she knows how to make a roux without breaking it and how to season appropriately as well. Super chunky and clumpy. Underwhelmed by the apps and shared plates we decided to just split the one main we ordered in the begining, the fried pork chop. This was the best thing here. The chop was moist, juicy and had a nice pink middle and was well seasoned. The mushroom gravy was lacking and the ""fried cabbage"" was totally raw. You cannot tell me that cabbage touched a pan that night. We also got pieces of the tough woody base of the cabbage due to poor cleaning  which really was the final straw for all of us. We would've complained and informed our server but we didn't see them again until the bill drop. Our server seemed really busy and we were so tired of having discussions about poor food at James Beard, NYT and Eater acclaimed Seattle spots that we just paid and left. This restaurant rubbed us all the wrong way. What Communion claims they are doing is cool, noble and unique but what they are doing like having $55 ($25 for a pound over at Jackson's Catfish Corner) farm raised catfish on the menu is, ironically, going against what they say they are doing. We read about the history of the neighborhood Communion is located in and how it has struggled with gentrification through the decades and honestly Communion is contributing to that problem. All of these dishes have the potential to be charged as the prices that were listed, if they were good, but to put plates infront of us that were unsafely cooked, had physical contamination, and really just half assed is downright insulting. I'd be happy to pay $10 for just one roll and crab butter, at an ""upscale"" restaurant if it's deserving of that price. And nothing here was deserving. The food at Communion is simply not attainable to the folks they seemingly made this restaurant for. We loved the focus on local products, ingredients and food culture but it's just squandered.  ""Everybody's gotta eat"" is not an appropriate mantra for this establishment. I felt almost performative eating here. 1/5

**Breadfarm:** in Edison WA an hour north but worth saying how great the bread and shortbread all was. 4/5

**Howdy Bagel**: In Tacoma, but worth saying it was some of the best bagels we have ever had. The Chili crispy cream cheese spread was fantastic and it was full of good folks and good vibes. 4.5/5

**EDIT:** Forgot about **Local Tide:** One of our top 3 spots. So so so so good! That Black Cod puts Nobu's Cod to shame! Melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Spicy Fish sandwich with sichuan peppercorns and mala mayo was great, salmon belly dip was insane, fantastic chips, great chowder. Flawless in our eyes. 5/5

Overall, we learned our lesson to not trust James Beard, NYT or Eater lists when we go to our next city. It was really surprising that the worst food of our trip was from the most acclaimed spots. Some of the Beard awards were for specific items, like the burger at Beast and Cleaver, and they dont even do said items anymore. It was a very interesting and confusing pattern that we all noticed and made us wonder about the politics and culture behind food review and award programs and organizations based in Seattle. We havent had this problem following Beard acclaimed spots prior but maybe it's just how they are going now in 24/25.

I mostly sat down to write this to see what locals think about these highly acclaimed spots not delivering on the acclaim. Are we just too picky or is this a Seattle thing?",19,1737761293.0,SeattleWA,24,0.83,False

I see this question gets asked every 2-3 months or so, but since it’s been a minute and these things tend to fizzle in and out, I was wondering if there is an active book club focused on self help/philosophy from authors such as Brene Brown, Tara Brach, Tich Nhat Hanh and others along this vein?

I had one of those “aha” moments that changed everything for me when I was sitting in a coffee shop, just trying to get some quiet time. I noticed a woman in the corner, her two kids sitting next to her. The weight of her exhaustion was so visible, it almost felt like you could see it hanging in the air around her. It wasn’t just the tiredness from the day. It was something deeper, something borne from a life filled with struggle. Her kids were quiet, sensing the heaviness that surrounded them.

I had no plan, no grand idea. I just walked over to her table, looked her in the eyes, and asked if she wanted some company. It was a simple gesture. I wasn’t expecting anything in return, and truthfully, I didn’t even know why I did it. But as I sat there, something shifted in me. That moment, that exchange, wasn’t about me being “good.” It wasn’t about fixing anything. It was about connection.

And that’s when it hit me: Happiness isn’t something we “find” or “earn.” It’s something we create in every interaction, in every moment we choose to show up for each other. Real happiness isn’t about doing more for ourselves—it’s about showing up, being present, and sharing something real with someone else.

Here’s what no one tells you about kindness: it’s a secret that works both ways. When we give kindness, it doesn’t just make the other person feel good. It releases oxytocin—the “love hormone”—in our brains, and that’s scientifically proven to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being. In other words, kindness doesn’t just make the world better. It makes you feel better, too. It’s not self-sacrifice. It’s a win-win.

What would happen if, just for one day, we chose to be kind to everyone we met, without any expectation of return? Not because it’s going to change your life in a flash, but because it’s the right thing to do. Imagine waking up tomorrow and instead of thinking, “What’s next for me?” you think, “How can I make this moment better for someone else?”

That’s the kind of world I want to live in. Not one where we’re all fighting for the same prize, but where we lift each other up simply because it makes us all better. Because kindness, real, genuine kindness, has a ripple effect that spreads beyond anything we can imagine.

So, ask yourself: how will you show up today? The beauty is, you don’t need a grand gesture. The smallest act—a smile to a stranger, holding the door for someone, listening without judgment—can have an impact far greater than anything you expect.

Kindness isn’t about being perfect. It’s about making a choice, a choice we can all make every single day. And that choice? It’s the one that makes happiness not just possible—but inevitable. We’re not waiting for happiness to come to us. We’re creating it, one moment at a time, through the simple power of kindness.

We already have everything we need to be happy. We just have to remember to share it.",4,1737761044.0,thinkatives,3,1.0,False

1i993lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i993lh/am_i_the_asshole_for_feeling_annoyed_all_the_time/,Am I the asshole for feeling annoyed all the time around my friend,"For context: I have moved countries a lot the past couple of years and have many friends who live abroad and come back to occasionally to where I live, Dublin, to visit me. 

One girl, Amanda, is from Poland but studied here in Dublin for a year where we became good friends, before she eventually returned to Poland. But we made plans for her to come and stay with me for a week the following term. 

When she arrived, things started to go wrong almost immediately. She had asked me the day before to pick her up from the airport. Traveling there and back from the airport would cost me like 16 euro, and take 2 hours in total, so I said honestly I’d prefer not to. None of my friends have ever asked me to do this before, and I have not expected them to do this for me when I traveled to them, as none of us have cars, it seems pointless. 

She responded by asking me if I could “at least” pick her up from the bus stop. The bus stop is about a 35 minute walk from my house, and it was pouring rain. Again I do not see the point of this, as I don’t have a car. I suggested she get an Uber but she complained that she didn’t want to spend the money (though it would have only been a 5 minute car ride so not that expensive). Then the guilt tripping started. She texted me saying that her bags and laptop were getting wet in the rain (I don’t see how my being there would change that), and if I could at least meet her halfway, and if it was “so inconvenient” for me to go and meet her. Because she refused to accept my no for an answer I eventually did go out in the rain to meet her, and had to hide my annoyance when we met. 

The following issue was transportation. She told me she had left her green card (what we use in Ireland for the bus) at home and asks if I could cover the bus fare the first time we took it. I have no issue covering for my friends once in a while if they need it, so I said sure. What I didn’t realise is that she would depend on me to pay for the bus every single time. My card, which I had managed to make last the whole year, eventually ran out of money, causing an embarassing situation where the bus driver told me to top up my card and pay at the next stop. Once we sat down She proceeded to tell me that she was concerned about what we would do now that my card had run out. I asked her if she had any money, she said yes, and then asked if she could use that to pay for the bus. I have no idea why she would ask me that anyways when she is capable of paying for herself, and I never offered to bankroll this trip for her. She also did not offer to help pay when I topped up my card, even though she was sitting next to me when I was doing it.

There were other smaller issues too. For instance, my flatmate keeps a bowl of chocolates on our coffee table, mostly for the aesthetic as she doesn’t eat them herself. Of course, it is fine for our guests to have 2 or 3. Amanda started eating them when we were watching a film. Of course, nothing wrong with that. But at one point during the movie I looked at the bowl and saw that it was almost empty. I told her that i would prefer it if she didn’t continue eating them, as they were my flatmates and not mine. She indicated that she had heard me. Later, I went to the bathroom and when I came back saw that she had eaten more of them. Now don’t get me wrong, I know it isn’t exactly a crime, but when you put it all together I was beginning to feel that she felt a bit entitled to my food and money. 

To top it all off, the day she was meant to leave for the airport she told me her Uber account wasn’t working and asked me to order her one, which I did. However, I insisted this time that she repay me for it, which she eventually did a few days later. But I still found it strange that she didn’t know until the minute she was supposed to go that her Uber account didn’t work. 

Overall, I just felt that she depended on me far too much throughout the trip. perhaps I should have communicated more clearly with her that this behaviour was rubbing me the wrong way, it could be a cultural difference because we Irish are not usually so blunt as to say “hey it’s annoying me when you do xyz” and I know polish people are more comfortable being blunt so perhaps she didn’t pick up on my attempts to say no for that reason. But I have to say her behaviour came across to me as quite pushy and clingy. honestly, out of all the times I’ve had a friend stay over I am the most relieved that this one is over!!",1,1737760911.0,AITAH,1,0.6,False
1i992hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i992hy/aita_latte_girl_edition/,AITA: Latte Girl edition,"So, I worked at the most popular donut franchise in New England for eight years. Over those grueling years I had SEVERAL wild Karens come to my counter...Karens, Kevins, Carols, etc. Here's a few for your drama seeking pleasure:

1) I had just arrived at my place of employment, hadn't even put the accoutrement of my uniform on yet. I see a regular come in, I alert the person behind the counter (who was busy restocking so she was bent down and couldn't see anybody coming)...I let them know by telling them ""Latte girl is coming up to the counter."" 
[NOW! This lady had been coming in every few days with a ""latte"" that was ""made incorrectly""...dor the longest time we were to remake beverages that came back to us messed up. It was the policy not to ask questions, at the time. HOWEVER, I don't think this lady thought she would EVER get caught! One day, one of my coworkers popped the top and gave it a whiff-THIS BITCH WAS BRINGING US EXPIRED CHOCOLATE MILK SO SHE COULD GET A FREE MOTHERTRUCKIN' LATTE EVERY COUPLE OF FUCKING DAYS!!] *Ahem*.....After letting my coworker behind the counter know that ""latte girl"" was coming, I slipped into the back to put my things away in a locker. I came out and the girl saw-and subsequently stopped me from getting to the computer so I could clock-in. This bXtch proceeded to scream at me that ""she heard what I said"" and how ""I shouldn't be speaking about her like that"", etc., etc. I tried explaining that I didn't say anything offensive and that I didn't know her name, I solely knew that she would ALWAYS get a latte. My manager had the office door open at the time and heard both what I had said when she came in and the whole a$$ racket she was making over it. She came out to deal with her and I went to clock in. Later my manager asked what time I ended up clocking-in, dealing with her yelling took me 20 minutes, she said that she would fix my time later and to try avoiding ""latte girl"".

2) On a seperate instance, ""lattw girl"" had a boyfriend, or husband, idk, they came in always looking like they were on another planet! (Her*ine, is a hell of a drug, and it has made itself cozy where I live) The male equivalent to ""latte girl"" came in with two beverages, his girl's spoiled milk and a plain iced coffee. I could tell that the coffee was one of ours, most likely he forgot to drink it after a hit of whatever was the flavor of droog he had taken and wanted it remade. The policy on remakes was pretty simple, if it was made wrong, we remake it, if you left it in your car for a whole day, in August, that is on you, buddy, and you can feel free to buy yourself a new one...just you, know, drink the dam* thing! It's not that hard, broski! BUT, when he was informed that he wojld be getting nothing remade (cause by this time we knew both of their faces, at least her ""latte"", and they had altered the policy because of them) he decided he was going to make a scene. Sadly, my manager, at the time, had left for the day. So there really wasn't anybody to back me up. I was the oldest person on the floor and the people behind him were getting rather agitated. Thankfully, another (more level headed and mature) regular of mine stepped up and told the remake seeking cr@ckhead to leave. And he stood up for me the frozen little coffee jocky who looked like she was about to cry. I made a note for my manager detailing the event and (my location was inside of a gas station) the gas station attendant called police to issue a no trespass order on them.

3) One night, about 5 years in, it was a busy day and we had just died down from the ""dinner"" rush. An older gentleman, whom we had had problems with before but it was always just a ""he's a rude dick"" kind of episodes. I took the gus order, and made his coffee, he was waiting on food, which he did not order! He ordered coffee and that was it! I noticed him standing looking around at all of us, two minors, another woman a couple years younger than myself, and me. So I approach him and ask what he's still waiting on, exasperated he replies that he is waiting for his food. I apologized and explained that I didn't hear him order any food. 

Guest: my buddy ordered two bagels with *jrijdns* (I heard him say cream cheese, that will be important later).
Me: okay, was one of them supposed to be for you?
Guest: yeah, he got his and left he's 20 minutes down the road (fast food customers have no concept of time and how it moves)
Me: and did he tell any of us that one was supposed to be for you?
Guest: *grumbling* yeah, he did!
Me: *sigh* fine, I apologize again. I will have that right oit for you.
--I make him his bagel with cream cheese. I hand it to him.--

Guest: *checks the contents* this is supposed to be a cinnamon raisen bagel! 
Me: I thought you said plain, my fault, I apologize. *Make it a second time* 
Guest: *grabs it from me and walks out*
Me: *turning to one of my coworkers* I have to run to the bathroom. I'll be right back. *goes to the other side of the store cause that's where the batheoom is*
----I come out and there is raised voices...
Guest: *throws the bagel and cream cheese with a bite taken out of it and angrily points at me before I even make it back behind the counter* YOU, that was supposed to be a cinnamon raiden bagel toasted with butter!
Me: *said in an apologetic and kinda ""you brought this on yourself"" tone* Maybe you should order your own food and drink? Or tell somebody that you want it in a separate bag. 
Guest: *fuming calling the multi-unit manager*
[Turns out he had come back in while I was in the bathroom, screaming for ""the big girl"" at one of the minors. Which is when the other adult on the floor stepped in. She rufused to remake his bagel, or to tell him where I was.] 
Me: *headset is beeping cause there was somebody at the menu board* you guys go deal with that. I will remake the bagel. I am truly sorry for the mix up, here is your money for the bagel back. *remake his d@mn bagel CORRECTLY. While the husband of our MU manager leans over the pick up counter [they lived an couple of doors down from the gas station] telling me to refund him and remake his order* what do you think I'm doing? You're a little late to the party, my guy.

****unfortunately, the other adult was fired for standing up for the minors being yelled at by a rude old man...

4) same old man, couple years later. Corporate had changed the cups from Styrofoam to double walled paper cups (everyone hated that). The cranky old man, who has mellowed over the passed couple years, comes in during the day to get two coffees, both XL! The transaction goes smoothly, no problems there. 
Fast forward a few hours, this man comes in with an almost empty paper cup with the bottom half colored like coffee. I, assuming he had spilled it at some point, offer him a new one:

Guest: *waves his hand* I'm not worried it's not my coffee. It did leak all over my business partner's laptop computer.
Me: *thinking it tipped over or something* you waited this long to bring it back?
Guest: *confused* we just noticed it.
Me: *needing to take a breath* sir, are you telling me you left a PAPER cup, full of coffee on a laptop computer and you thought the paper wouldn't break down at some point?
Guest: the old ones never did!
Me: *trying so hard to keep it together* what would you like me to do about that? We don't have the Styrofoam cups anymore.

The following morning was awkward, to say the least. My mom casually asked why I had been in her bedroom the night before, and all I could muster up was:

“I wanted to ask you if I could borrow the car today.”

She sighed. I sensed she didn’t believe me.

“Sure, honey. Just don’t take too long. I need it by tonight.”

I nodded silently.

My mom then said, without looking up from her book, “Are you sure there’s nothing else you want to talk about? You know you can always talk to me, right?”

Her voice was calm, but there was an edge to it—a sharpness that felt misplaced. Her gaze lingered a second too long, making my skin crawl.

My dad took notice of the tension and shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

“No, Mom, really. I just needed to borrow the car.”

She finally looked up and held my gaze for an excruciatingly long time before she spoke.

“You know, you’ve been acting strangely.”

I almost choked on my coffee. *I’ve been acting strangely?*

I felt a strong urge to confront her about everything I’d heard. About the whispers. All of it. But then I realized how insane it would have sounded: *My dead sister and mom whispering to each other?*

My dad would take her side, surely. They might even have committed me. Was that her… their goal?

I felt like a moth pinned to a board under her stare, squirming under the weight of her unspoken accusations.

“I’ve been stressed lately,” I said finally. “I still have trouble finding a job. It wears me out a little.”

Her face was unreadable, but it felt like she was smirking behind her neutral gaze.

“Sure, I understand, but please don’t feel like a failure. Everyone falls on hard times.”

I got up and left. “I never said I felt like a failure.”

I heard her sigh as I left the uncomfortable conversation behind.

I couldn’t risk spying on her again, but I couldn’t just wait for whatever horrifying plan they had in store for me. Whatever punishment they felt I deserved.

At that point, I remembered my grandma’s warnings. I remembered how my mother had cut her off. Written her off as a superstitious oddball.

Considering everything, it now seemed I might do well listening to her for once.

I had already gotten permission to borrow the car, so I decided to go see her.

Grandma lived on the other side of town in a parcel house. Her front yard was overgrown with weeds. Clearly, she had gotten too old to tend to it herself.

I felt bad. It was my mom’s decision to cut her off, yet the rest of us followed her lead without much question. It had been years since I visited her.

When I rang the bell, a sudden rush of nostalgia came over me as I heard the tune playing: *“Oh, when the saints go marching in…”*

I remembered then, despite her oddities, how much I had enjoyed spending time with her before Hol died.

She invited me in with a smile on her face. If she was angry with me for not visiting more, it didn’t show.

The state of her house was in similar condition as her front yard—a mess. Boxes, trinkets, old souvenirs, and religious and occult objects flooded the place. The air inside was heavy, tinged with the faint metallic scent of old coins and something sour that I couldn’t place. Shadows seemed to pool in the corners of the room, too deep for the weak light to penetrate. I suddenly felt watched from the dark corners.

I sat, not knowing what to say, but it seemed she knew better than me.

“You look tired, dear.”

I sighed and mustered up the energy to ask.

“You once said this family had a history of tragedy. Like some kind of curse.”

She nodded. “Your mom and I never saw eye to eye on that. She wouldn’t hear it. I suppose she thought I was a superstitious old hag.” She chuckled, but her eyes betrayed her.

“Maybe I am. But we are who we are.”

I looked around at the strange symbols and objects that hung on her walls.

“Can you tell me about it?”

Her eyes lit up as if she’d been waiting for someone to ask her, yet she seemed worried too.

“Simon, dear, is something wrong?”

I paused.

“I think I’m cursed.”

She looked at me, and suddenly her expression changed into one of deep concern.

""‘It’s found you, hasn’t it?’ she whispered, almost as if the words themselves could summon something from the shadows.""

I swear it felt like the whispers were now inside my head, echoing and bouncing off the walls of my skull.

*“You’re not getting away. You’re not getting away. She can’t help you.”* They grew louder, overlapping and swirling together until they became a cacophony of taunts. Words I couldn’t fully grasp burrowed into my mind like claws.

I did my best to ignore it.

“What is it?”

Grandma sighed. “Something as old as time, I suppose. Causing rifts between people, breaking you down slowly. It wants to be you. Wants you to think it’s you.”

I felt unease in my entire body.

“I don’t understand.”

She placed a hand on my shoulder.

“It took your uncle. Before that, it took your grandfather. Even before that. Accidents, deaths, tragedy.”

I felt more confused than ever.

“Didn’t my uncle take his own life? I—”

Grandma interrupted.

“It made him do it. It whispered in his ears. That’s what it does, you know. It whispers when it doesn’t scream. Your uncle didn’t just take his own life,’ Grandma said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ‘He was... hollowed out. Like something had scooped out his will and left him an empty shell.’""

I had come looking for answers, but I was left more confused than ever.

“Why does it use my sister’s voice? I don’t understand.”

Grandma sighed.

“Only you know the answer to that. I can’t help you fight it. I can’t take you on this journey. I can only show you the door. It knows you, and it will use that against you. It knows your fears. Your insecurities. It will take everything you love and turn it into something ugly. Tell you that you are to blame for this. Once you’re weak enough, it will come for you, come to finish you off.”

She got up and started going through some old stuff. She found what looked like a wooden trinket—a circle with strange markings on it.

She handed me the carved circle, its surface covered in strange markings. ‘Wear this,’ she said, her voice trembling. ‘But remember—this can’t save you. Only you can do that.’

I was floored.

“How do you fight something like that?”

She took my hand.

“You know. Look into yourself, and you’ll know.”

Her touch brought me back in time.

Hol was there. We were playing hide and seek in Grandma’s house. It was just before Christmas, and the smell of cinnamon was everywhere. I had searched for Hol for what felt like hours.

Suddenly, I heard a wailing. I followed the sound until I found her in the playhouse out in Grandma’s backyard. She had accidentally locked herself inside.

“You didn’t find me. I thought you’d left me. I thought...”

And just like that, I was back in the room with Grandma.

I felt tears welling up.

“I can’t do this alone. Ever since Hol died, things have... Mom hates me. Dad doesn’t even care enough to hate me. I know it.”

Grandma shook her head.

“You can, and you will. You’re not alone, but this one thing—this one thing—you must do alone. You must look into yourself as you confront it. Reject its truth and find your own.”

I was on the verge of giving up.

“I don’t know how to do that.”

She gently grabbed my shoulder.

“You’ve forgotten so much, haven’t you? I can’t help you see it, but maybe I can show you the way. Look in your parents’ attic. There’s a yellow, faded box up there. Find it. Maybe it will help you remember. Help you see what you need to see.”

I felt defeated. Hopeless, yet determined to keep fighting.

As I got up, I stopped for a moment.

“Grandma? What really happened between you and Mom? Why don’t you talk?”

She looked at me. Her eyes were old and tired.

“Things were said. We both said things we shouldn’t have said. Your mom and I... we’re very different, dear. People handle tragedy differently.”

I nodded and headed for the door.

“Simon, dear?”

I stopped.

1i98xf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exLutheran/comments/1i98xf0/lutheran_educated_people_what_were_your/,Lutheran educated people: What were your experiences like going to a Lutheran school?,"Hey, guys! I'm new to this sub, but I saw this when researching religious trauma as I am currently embarking on my healing journey with my anxiety and depression. It has been a part of my life since senior year of high school. So, my question is...what were your experiences like going to a Lutheran school or college? Here are my experiences.

I was raised an Episcopalian, but went to LCMS schools from grades 2-12 for the most part.  However, from the second half of grade 6 to the first half of grade 9, I lived in another country due to my mother's job. Although I am Christian (I was never a Lutheran and never will be a Lutheran), I started to see how damaging those views we were taught at the end of my junior year in high school. I had a theology teacher; who was also a pastor at a nearby LCMS church, blatantly played favorites, and shoved his far-right views down students' throats--from going to hell if you are LGBTQ+ to showing videos of babies post-abortion. He hated being challenged with critical questions and one time got into an argument with a student in my period who was openly liberal. Towards the end of junior year (this was the turning point for me here), I was talking to one of my friends about how I didn't agree with his views before school started and he heard me and admonished me in the hallways in front of my peers. He then berated the entire first period because of what I did, and from then on, the theology teacher hated me. During senior year (I hated this year and was eager to get out), I helped out as an office aide during the last period of the day and I knocked on his door to deliver a hall pass to one of the students. He opened the door, grabbed it out of my hands, and slammed the door in my face. This (along with other trauma in my childhood) has ever since made me feel scared to ask people for something for the fear of bothering them. However, I am working to overcome this.

I also had a couple of grade school teachers who would berate me and my peers in front of the whole class if any of us made a mistake. One example would be I accidentally bumped into my third grade teacher and spilled her coffee on herself. I was also bullied during that time because I was shy, eccentric, and ""not Lutheran"".

When I went off to a public college and kept in touch with some people who I went to school with, that's when I fully realized that what I was taught was fucked up. In college, I went through a period questioning God and my faith. After starting therapy, I've learned that not all Christianity is ""bad"" and you do not have to go to church to be a good person--there are other ways to get in touch spiritually (ie praying, self-reflection, reading the Bible or devotions). I also have learned that what I was taught in school is not how you act as a Christian. Rather, it's being open-minded, being kind to others, and just being a good person overall.",5,1737760447.0,exLutheran,8,1.0,False

Pazta in Tai Kwun.,"I recently went to HK with my parents and others and went to this place as a group of 6. To note, my parents are from HK and we grew up travelling to HK every year, so I wouldn’t consider our group as a tourist. 

We came here for happy hour drinks and were given the happy hour menu. I ordered a mocktail from the menu, priced at $48, while others ordered wine, two Aperol Spritz cocktails, and a coffee. When the bill came, I noticed my mocktail was listed as $78—$30 more than the menu price. I questioned the waiter, a European (Italian I believe, who also has been mentioned in other reviews) gentleman, and without hesitation, he claimed the $78 was for the two Aperol Spritz. Thinking I might have misunderstood, I let it go.

After paying, I checked the receipt again and saw I was right—the mocktail was indeed charged at $78. My brother approached the waiter to address the issue, and his response was unbelievably dismissive. He didn’t say a word, handed my brother a $20 bill (not even the full overcharge amount), and walked off.

It’s not about the $30—it’s the principle. We were well within happy hour times, as proven by the correct pricing of the other drinks, but this slimy waiter blatantly overcharged us and acted annoyed when caught. How much of an underachiever in life do you have to be to stoop so low as to scam customers of $30 here and there? This isn’t just a mistake; it’s a deliberate, pathetic attempt to take advantage of people.

Avoid this place at all costs. It would be such a nice place as the atmosphere amazing given its location, however having this waiter working there who’s clearly resorting to scamming customers because he can’t succeed at anything else. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable, and it’s obvious he’s pulling this scam on as many tables as he can. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your money here. Unfortunate for the establishment and owners of the restaurant as this guy is going to run the place to the ground.

1i98r51,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1i98r51/i_need_sanity/,I need sanity,"Ive just become so aware of this man’s tendencies and ways. I am disgusted, heartbroken, and so disappointed. I’m struggling to separate him from who he’s portrayed himself to be. I’ve always only defensively reacted and now that I learned what grey rocking is, I’ve implemented it. Let me tell you it’s so sad to see how he denies, shifts blame, and has gibberish sometime. And if I respond with a valid point he hasn’t made it’s “I was getting there you didn’t have enough patience with me” or “Youre being too hard on me” 

I am noticing that I am anxious alllll the time so afraid to even ask him if we can talk. I find myself having no idea how to interact with him at all. I found some things in his phone after weeks of having concerns and trying to talk about them but with no acknowledgment. And when confronted he remained completely calm but was so manipulative and shifted blame and I am very defensive (I am unhealed in my own way due to my own trauma that I’m working on healing) but I just kept removing myself from his presence (we live together) 

Well finally the other night we finally sat down to talk after a full day of being separated and texting (I did my best to not respond) and I was able to remain calm and state my boundary (unfortunately it wasn’t even around him cheating, but at this point I understand it’s just more supplies for him and when those are going good hes more likely to accuse me, and I will use this information wisely) but my boundary was around him acknowledging my feelings and taking accountability for his role. And if not I’m removing myself from the situation. 

He reluctantly agreed while setting his own same boundary just around my defensive reactions and how they make him feel he can’t open up and communicate the way he wants. I agreed and told him no need to worry moving forward. He brought up something else but it was irrelevant to the topic at hand just trying to manipulate me some more.

At this point we’re watching a movie and eating, I’m thinking we’re cool we’ve come to an agreement and moving forward we both need to uphold our “boundaries.” 

I wake up in the morning and he is sleep on the couch in the bedroom and then I fall back asleep and this time when I wake up hes in the office room asleep (he does work remotely but this was around 11 in the afternoon he should’ve been working) at this point I am trying to manage my anxiety because I’m so confused as to why he’s over there. I am now alone and isolated dealing with what I think is the silent treatment. 

I never got an explanation he made it seem like everything was good. I even asked him if there was anything else he wanted to say, and nope. Well he never came over to the bedroom, but I heard him up and moving, and then I finally went over asked about work and made him a coffee. I asked when he was done if we could talk. 

He finally comes over and is visibly acting tired and flops down on the couch moaning. I ask if hes finished working and tell him it seems like he’s had a long day and then I proceed to tell him I feel like he was physically distancing himself away from me this morning after last night and I’m wondering if anything is on your mind. 

He initially denied that he had nothing to talk about then proceeded to tell me how I was wrong for not telling him I want this relationship still and want him and him to stay here after he saw people on Reddit bashing him and telling my friend that I might end the relationship. I said I apologize and all of that is gone now and my friend I deleted the message before she saw it. ( I reacted a little, I’m still working on short responses)

I said I had no idea he had felt that way until just now when he brought it up and told him I came to you and gave you space to talk about this you could’ve came and communicated this to me as well. Because when you give me the silent treatment it’s makes me feel isolated and alone and he said I’m being too hard on him. I get a chance to say I don’t feel like I’m being heard or seen now and he finally says I can’t do that right now so I’m just going to text you and left again. I feel he’s using a tactic but I’m starting to think maybe I am the problem? Idk I don’t want to get dragged back in. ",2,1737759980.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

1i98qn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1i98qn2/water_dispenser_doesnt_cool/,Water Dispenser Doesn't Cool,"Hi there! I have a Primo ""Htrio"" bottom-load water dispenser that dispenses cold water, hot water, and coffee (model# 601258).

A few days ago, the cold water stopped being cold, and is now room temperature, hotter if I turn on the hot water.

It had already happened once in the past, at which point I opened it to check if maybe the baffle had come loose (it didn't seem to have if there's even one, I couldn't feel anything loose in there). Then a few days later, it magically fixed itself and had worked perfectly fine ever since.

I've tried looking it up, some mention tweaking the thermostat that might be in a dead spot, but I don't think that's possible on this model. I did also try to leave it unplugged for a few days but it didn't change anything, and it doesn't seem to want to magically fix itself this time :p

If anyone has an idea, I'd be happy to try it, we love our water/coffee dispenser :D

EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mention: the compressor does seem to be running as it's constantly making a humming sound, and can be heard stopping quite loudly when turning off the cold water (or unplugging the dispenser).",1,1737759941.0,fixit,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1i98mz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i98mz3/bed_wetting_in_older_children/,Bed wetting in older children,"So to jump straight in TW mention of SA upcoming and long.

I have two boys now 11 and turning 13, they were sexually assaulted multiple times by a peer, another child their age, who was the son of my friend, between the ages of 4yrs and 6yrs.

I already beat myself up enough for not noticing or realising this was going on and I will live with that trauma and guilt for the rest of my life, I just didn't expect that could be happening when they were meant playing lego in the bedroom and I talked with my friend over coffee in the kitchen. I didn't suspect another child could do this.

The SA all came out when my eldest was 6. 

After Dr visits and phone calls with councillors  I was told that i was lucky because with their age, if we didn't keep bringing the subject up they would forget about it, that they would be ok long term, that they didn't need any form of therapy and would have no recolection of the incident and that only I would live with the vicarious trauma of it. 

There's also a lot of details on the other child's own traumatic past and how he had convinced my boys not to say anything for so long but it's irrelevant to the question I want to get to.

Around this age for my boys we were in the process of night time toilet training and were making some progress here and there, within the normal range. My youngest is a thumb sucker also and we were also trying to work on that too. My children and I then moved towns as I couldn't face my children still attending the same school as the other child or living so close to them anymore.

Over time, the bed wetting for both and the thumb sucking for my youngest just didn't seem to change. It just stuck. I seen doctors who tested for diabetes and checked their bladder and all was fine, I kept being told it was due to them being very heavy sleepers and to just be patient every time I went back. We've done water limitations at night, toileting before bed, night time beepers, setting all sorts of alarms to get them up, I have read so many books and tried so many suggestions to help them over come this and nothing is working.

I recently spoke with another professional about the bed wetting and she asked a bit more about the past SA. After I told her the above she told me that between the ages of 0 - 8 are critical ages for development and that it could very well be the underlying subconscious cause of the continued bed wetting and everyday stressors may be exasperating the issues. She seems very positive that we can work on it together and make progress for them.

I feel like I've had a bombshell dropped on me when she told me this.
Is this information right? Could their continued bed wetting over the years be because of this past trauma?
I feel so stupid for not realising the correlation.

I was reassured so many times that they would forget and they would be ok and it wouldn't affect them as they grew older.

Any advice is welcome, I just want my boys to be ok.

Maybe Origami or Flower?,"Looking for some advice on beginner droppers.  I think I just need to talk this out after a week of reading and YouTube videos...

I'm new to coffee.  I want to learn the ropes and get good results, but I don't want this to turn into a full-time hobby.  I don't want the stress of tweaking and dialing in a half dozen parameters with a notebook.  Maybe someday, but my goal now is just to go from No Experience to Pretty Good Reliable Coffee.

I've experimented with a dozen cups on a French press, Aeropress, and a V60 using Peet's pre-ground and a few $20 bags from a local roaster to see if I even like coffee and the flavor differences people refer to.  The V60 was under-extracted, (edit: which I think makes sense because I was using medium-ground super market coffee -- at any rate I tried a few different grinds and techniques and realize this is going to be a long process to learn which I'm not interested in now...), but I loved the AeroPress and French press.  However, I want to do pour over for a number of reasons, primarily because of the easy setup and cleanup.

Goals and requirements:

* Enjoy decent medium roast in an easy and hassle-free way.
* I don't like bright and acidic coffee.
* I like medium to medium-dark, rich, deep, rounded cups.
* Materials: glass, ceramic, etc.  Anything that isn't plastic or aluminum.
* I don't need a Hario Switch because I have a French press, and I'm not a fan of the Switch's looks.

Equipment:

* I will be ordering a 1zpresso K-Ultra.  I hear it is a nice all-around grinder that is solidly good in all categories and is forgiving.  I want to play with finer grinds for espresso someday and.
* Goose neck kettle and scale.

Thoughts:

* V60: This is pour-over on Hard Mode.  I already have one in the cupboard that I can take back out if I want to go down the rabbit hole of recipes and specialty coffee.  It will stay in the cupboard for niw.
* Kalita Wave: I read comments that say the Kalita Wave has a nice sweetness and rich flavor, and is very forgiving. To be honest this sounds perfect.  Is this a single pour dripper?
* Hario Mugen: The mugen seems less popular, but is advertised as single pour and hard to mess up.  Seems very similar to the wave.  Is it?  Is it just as easy?  It's less pretty.  How do I decide?
* The Hario Switch sounds very similar to a French press, and I already have a V60, so I see no reason to buy this.
* Origami: What is this one about?  Is it forgiving like the Mugen and Wave?
* Cafec Deep Flower: I hear this one is good for brewing rich small servings of coffee.  Maybe a bit like the Aeropress?  Is it finicky? I don't want finicky.

**TL;DR**: I think I want a Wave or the Mugen.  Can both do single pour?  Are they both similar?  Or do I really want a Cafec Deep Flower, or Origami?  I want forgiving, beginner-friendly, rich cups, not light tea-like coffee.",1,1737759547.0,pourover,18,1.0,False

“Thank you, neighbor,” I murmur, the sound of the closing door lingering in the still air.

11 AM.

I make a cup of coffee, the rich aroma curling into the quiet corners of my home. I think of the old man's kind gesture. It was nice to speak with him today. As I stand in thought, my eyes drift to my dog, his eager face filled with unwavering love. His happiness persists despite my neglect. Those beautiful little eyes, set on a tilted head, gaze up at me with a love I have failed to notice for too long. In my own mopey disinterest, I missed him—missed the way his heart beats with his own quiet joys, his own little world. Even our repetitive walks around the same dull block fill his day with wonder. It’s his day too.

What am I doing? My poor dog.

I am not alone. Despite everything, I resolve to think positively and wish well—because everyone deserves a good day.

I grab my towel and head for a shower. The winter chill lingers, promising the water will be just right.

As I prepare for the day, I put on some music, letting my playlist unfold my recent history. A video pops up—the lovely girl I met yesterday. A simple picture, yet it pulls me out of the trance I've been stuck in. She’s beautiful, intriguing. Perhaps it's a fake photo, artificially generated like so much else in this world. Still, I smile, caught in the warmth of the thought.

Yesterday lingers in my mind. The images of the story she spoke of flood my thoughts—narrow alleys winding through an ancient city, people moving with purpose, their daily lives bustling past me as I drift through like a ghost transcending time and space. Deja vu. A dream I had last night, a fleeting respite after days of resisting rest.

I pause, considering the weight of it all. Memories whisper to me—things I can barely remember yet cannot let go of. If only I knew a hypnotist, maybe I could ""Eternal Sunshine"" this dull ache from my chest, erase this lingering dread and disinterest. Maybe then I could bear through the day.

The water hits me, startling but soothing. As I adjust, another video from my history plays—an angel I had never heard of before. Learning something new has always been a passion of mine, though not as easy as it once was. Maybe I only absorb what resonates, what aligns with me. Everything else is just noise. But this—this feels meant for me. I'm not religious, not really. And yet, these past few years, especially this last one, have been profound, awakening something deep within me.

Cold rivulets trace my skin, and I reflect on the words shared by the stranger on the message board. Could be a bot. Could be a ghost account. But the warmth in those words lingers, wrapping around me as the cold water rushes down. My thoughts slow, falling into a familiar trance. In moments like these, something within me shifts, as though an alter ego awakens. Not possession, but an ancient awareness etched in the deepest rings of my being.

""Bear with the day.""

No. I don't want to. No one should simply bear with their day. We must confront our demons, shine light into the dark corners of our souls, and heal. We either aid others or let them be. We make peace with those we've lost.

Music. Cold water. Clear thoughts. The story of the angel. Everything, everywhere, all at once—connected.

Fading memories do not prevent new moments from unfolding. I am of no grand significance, nor do I pretend to be. I am equal, ordinary, flawed. My soul, my body—average as any, beautiful as all creations of this world. I acknowledge my demons. They knock softly in the dark, scream into the void. I have always been intrigued by them, by the extraordinary that walks unseen among us. Angels in forms beyond good and evil.

I attract many things, many energies. Wisdom seeps through pulses I receive from places unknown. I've long believed my soul to be dark, my mind imaginative to the point of delusion. I'm just human, after all. Yet, my shifting persona moves through different states of being—sometimes light, sometimes shadow. Luck always lingers around me, and protection follows closely.

I refuse discomfort, seeking peace in my presence. Too strong to be possessed, too in tune to ignore the subtle calls that pull me forward. I am drawn to what beckons me.

What if I told you the secret to happiness isn’t a distant goal you have to work toward, but something you already have the power to create in every single moment?

I get it. The world constantly tells us happiness is about getting the next promotion, buying the next thing, achieving the next milestone. We’ve been conditioned to think it’s a destination. But what if the real answer is much simpler—and much more beautiful?

I had one of those “aha” moments that changed everything for me when I was sitting in a coffee shop, just trying to get some quiet time. I noticed a woman in the corner, her two kids sitting next to her. The weight of her exhaustion was so visible, it almost felt like you could see it hanging in the air around her. It wasn’t just the tiredness from the day. It was something deeper, something borne from a life filled with struggle. Her kids were quiet, sensing the heaviness that surrounded them.

I had no plan, no grand idea. I just walked over to her table, looked her in the eyes, and asked if she wanted some company. It was a simple gesture. I wasn’t expecting anything in return, and truthfully, I didn’t even know why I did it. But as I sat there, something shifted in me. That moment, that exchange, wasn’t about me being “good.” It wasn’t about fixing anything. It was about connection.

And that’s when it hit me: Happiness isn’t something we “find” or “earn.” It’s something we create in every interaction, in every moment we choose to show up for each other. Real happiness isn’t about doing more for ourselves—it’s about showing up, being present, and sharing something real with someone else.

Here’s what no one tells you about kindness: it’s a secret that works both ways. When we give kindness, it doesn’t just make the other person feel good. It releases oxytocin—the “love hormone”—in our brains, and that’s scientifically proven to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being. In other words, kindness doesn’t just make the world better. It makes you feel better, too. It’s not self-sacrifice. It’s a win-win.

What would happen if, just for one day, we chose to be kind to everyone we met, without any expectation of return? Not because it’s going to change your life in a flash, but because it’s the right thing to do. Imagine waking up tomorrow and instead of thinking, “What’s next for me?” you think, “How can I make this moment better for someone else?”

That’s the kind of world I want to live in. Not one where we’re all fighting for the same prize, but where we lift each other up simply because it makes us all better. Because kindness, real, genuine kindness, has a ripple effect that spreads beyond anything we can imagine.

So, ask yourself: how will you show up today? The beauty is, you don’t need a grand gesture. The smallest act—a smile to a stranger, holding the door for someone, listening without judgment—can have an impact far greater than anything you expect.

Kindness isn’t about being perfect. It’s about making a choice, a choice we can all make every single day. And that choice? It’s the one that makes happiness not just possible—but inevitable. We’re not waiting for happiness to come to us. We’re creating it, one moment at a time, through the simple power of kindness.

We already have everything we need to be happy. We just have to remember to share it.",2,1737759249.0,Portalawake,0,1.0,False

One of my friends lives up the road and works near my job and we are in the office the same days, so naturally they get a lift there and back. This is not really a problem I'm going anyways.
Recently they've started asking me to hang out places they'd like to go, like a hike, and not even have the courage to ask me to drive just really heavily hint.

We were going to hang out in the gym the other day and they asked could they bring their sister, who I don't really know and I said of course, but it became apparent the two of them just wanted a lift.

Today we were going to hang out and go to big Tesco, and have a catch up, and once again they asked to bring their sister and we all ended up just kind of shopping separately.

Would I be the asshole if I stopped giving them lifts to work and places all together and just say I'll meet them there, even though I have to drive by their house.

I have never been offered a coffee, petrol or anything as a thanks for driving, and am feeling not appreciated at all.

1i98bcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rad_thoughts/comments/1i98bcp/why_the_secret_to_true_happiness_isnt_what_youve/,Why the Secret to True Happiness Isn’t What You’ve Been Told,"We’ve been chasing happiness the wrong way our entire lives. What if I told you the secret to happiness isn’t a distant goal you have to work toward, but something you already have the power to create in every single moment?

I get it. The world constantly tells us happiness is about getting the next promotion, buying the next thing, achieving the next milestone. We’ve been conditioned to think it’s a destination. But what if the real answer is much simpler—and much more beautiful?

I had one of those “aha” moments that changed everything for me when I was sitting in a coffee shop, just trying to get some quiet time. I noticed a woman in the corner, her two kids sitting next to her. The weight of her exhaustion was so visible, it almost felt like you could see it hanging in the air around her. It wasn’t just the tiredness from the day. It was something deeper, something borne from a life filled with struggle. Her kids were quiet, sensing the heaviness that surrounded them.

I had no plan, no grand idea. I just walked over to her table, looked her in the eyes, and asked if she wanted some company. It was a simple gesture. I wasn’t expecting anything in return, and truthfully, I didn’t even know why I did it. But as I sat there, something shifted in me. That moment, that exchange, wasn’t about me being “good.” It wasn’t about fixing anything. It was about connection.

And that’s when it hit me: Happiness isn’t something we “find” or “earn.” It’s something we create in every interaction, in every moment we choose to show up for each other. Real happiness isn’t about doing more for ourselves—it’s about showing up, being present, and sharing something real with someone else.

Here’s what no one tells you about kindness: it’s a secret that works both ways. When we give kindness, it doesn’t just make the other person feel good. It releases oxytocin—the “love hormone”—in our brains, and that’s scientifically proven to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being. In other words, kindness doesn’t just make the world better. It makes you feel better, too. It’s not self-sacrifice. It’s a win-win.

What would happen if, just for one day, we chose to be kind to everyone we met, without any expectation of return? Not because it’s going to change your life in a flash, but because it’s the right thing to do. Imagine waking up tomorrow and instead of thinking, “What’s next for me?” you think, “How can I make this moment better for someone else?”

That’s the kind of world I want to live in. Not one where we’re all fighting for the same prize, but where we lift each other up simply because it makes us all better. Because kindness, real, genuine kindness, has a ripple effect that spreads beyond anything we can imagine.

So, ask yourself: how will you show up today? The beauty is, you don’t need a grand gesture. The smallest act—a smile to a stranger, holding the door for someone, listening without judgment—can have an impact far greater than anything you expect.

Kindness isn’t about being perfect. It’s about making a choice, a choice we can all make every single day. And that choice? It’s the one that makes happiness not just possible—but inevitable. We’re not waiting for happiness to come to us. We’re creating it, one moment at a time, through the simple power of kindness.

We already have everything we need to be happy. We just have to remember to share it.",2,1737758809.0,rad_thoughts,0,1.0,False
