I found plenty of info online how this is a legit legal requirement for any business playing music.... But it just feels wrong... I know not everyone is paying this fee.. I'm sure the big chains probably do pay it.... I know it's risky to ignore it.... But it's another cost that the customers aren't aware of that is slowly destroying our small independent coffee shop it's so frustrating at a time where we are struggling so much!

It's what I went to college for and what I wanted to make a career out of. Unfortunately, the industry (especially in California, where I live) has been in dire straights for the longest time, and I've been out of work for 16 months as of posting. I've been trying to do Doordash as a way to bring in a little money (""not enough"" is better than ""none at all"", I say), but I've had multiple dashes the past few weeks with zero hits, so it's no longer a viable income avenue for me.

  
Around town, I see a lot of listings for a lot of service jobs (Starbucks, Target, Ross, Coffee Bean, Chipotle, etc.), and I want to apply to some of them just to have a job and a consistent form of income again. My only problem is that I'm afraid my resume is too stacked with Post-Production jobs to be attractive to any of these places, and the skills I used on the job aren't exactly the most transferable (I don't think a Chipotle shift lead will care that I oversaw a fleet of footage ingestion workstations or that I know how to use DaVinci Resolve), or that I'm too old to be applying to places staffed mainly by people in their teens and early 20s.

I‚Äôm putting together an espresso setup with a budget of 10,000 DKK (\~$1,450 USD) and could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been researching a ton, but I feel like I‚Äôm going in circles now.

I found a good deal on the La Pavoni Mini Cellini, but there‚Äôs barely any info about it online‚Äîanyone know if it‚Äôs solid? The Profitec Go also looks interesting, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the best pick for the price.

For grinders, it seems like Eureka Mignon models (Perfetto, Turbo, etc.) are a safe bet, but I‚Äôm open to other suggestions.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in a setup:

‚Ä¢ Fast heat-up time 

‚Ä¢ Shot timer would be nice

‚Ä¢ Good steaming performance (I like milk drinks)

‚Ä¢ Grinder that‚Äôs quiet, time/weight based, not single dose and works well for both espresso and filter coffee

‚Ä¢ Not interested in lever machines or buying used

It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs even a thought that goes through my head at all, I love them in a platonic way but it just struck me as something I never really thought about before. 

Have no issues talking to women and making friends but I‚Äôve never really been considered anything more than that. How does one go about sexualizing/romanticizing themselves to make themselves an entity ‚Äòthat ought to be loved‚Äô? It‚Äôs not even like it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in the friend-zone, it feels like I just don‚Äôt have the intrinsic qualities of something that is loveable. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be rejected because I wouldn‚Äôt even be seen as an option to begin with, y‚Äôknow what I mean? It‚Äôs like the idea of dating your coffee table. The table is nice, good to have around, and super useful. But would you *love* the table? Probably not. 

On one hand it‚Äôs nice knowing that other people feel safe around you / trust you / want you around but the fact I‚Äôve lived my entire life without being seen in a romantic context is starting to eat away at my ego. I don‚Äôt know what it takes to be ‚Äòseen‚Äô in that type of way. 

It‚Äôs isolating to show up to a gathering where everyone brought their partner except for you. I‚Äôm afraid my peers think less of me because of my loneliness, which then makes me feel the need to isolate further. Getting to 21 years old without even getting to a talking stage feels humiliating. The older I get the more it eats away at me because I know how society sees that as a red flag. My biggest fear is my loneliness being seen as some sort of indictment of my character, I don‚Äôt want to be seen as problematic because I‚Äôm alone. But that being said, maybe loneliness *is* an indictment to my character?

Feel like a jerk venting about loneliness in a romantic context when some people here are desperate for any interaction at all, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been eating away at me for a while. Being unlovable is a very isolating feeling, it feels as if everyone else is in on an inside joke you‚Äôre not in on. It doesn‚Äôt feel like theres anything I can do to make myself lovable, it‚Äôs just an inherent aspect of my identity. Just something a person is born with.

jan 24 I decided to visit my friends like from (iloilo to bacolod) from graveyard shift no sleep.

anw my only plan that time is kunin yung parcel ko from our old house sa bacolod kase Ive ordered something from korea na I forgot na dun pala naka address sa bacolod hindi sa updated which is dapat sa iloilo.. so Im planning to just hang out nalang din with my 1 girl friend(rose) na from bacolod din para sulit din naman gala ko

but my friend rose asked me if we can invite our guy friend(jet) to have coffee with us so I just said yes para atleast we have someone na talkative

forward sa cafe shop jet and I are very close before jet and rose become close (anyway rose have feelings with jet and he knows it lol) then jet out of sudden mention our other girl friend(dianne) just told me na dont post anything sa story ko sa ig so dianne wont see it, but Im the person who dont mind it

so I chat dianne and told her that I am with jet and rose and that time I didnt know pero the format ng chat ko sa kanya is ""hagad ya kami kape""(inaya nya kami mag coffee)
I really dont know pero I didnt mind this message kase sabi lang ni dianne sa chat with me is just ""ok enjoy""

me and jet and dianne are the original trio like we are always together before we separated our path because me and dianne decided to grab higher opportunities with different company so only jet lang ang naiwan sa old company namin, but even before they always hang out together na sila lang dalawa like jet and dianne lang and I dont mind because I am married with kids and working mom so its really hard sometimes to join them, so I dont really mind them hanging out just two of them 

so eto na nga dianne message me just out nowhere with ""I thought jet is the one who asked you to have coffee with him?""
I was like.. huh? then I remember maybe she is talking about that day na we had coffee pero kase its like a month ago na so like out of the blue?
pero as what Ive said Im not the person na dont care and dont plan to explain anything
then she send a new message again saying
""I dont get it why you have to lie that jet is the one who asked you to have coffee when you're the one who asked him?""
lol how did I lie?? I get it mali ko na I send her a message that day na saying jet is the one who asked us, but HOW CAN SHE LIKE HOW COULD SHE TELL ME NA I LIED TO HER! its not even intentional or mean to tell her that, pero my point is whats with her na kailangan nya mag sabi na I lied and why do I need to explain when I dont even mind them going out before without me????? she is just friend? it's clearly obvious that she is being jealous!

1iyd1kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iyd1kv/why_does_the_breville_bambino_espresso_machine/,Why does the Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS deliver exceptional quality? A detailed review of this compact espresso maker,"The Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS has been my go-to for brewing espresso at home for the past few weeks. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee, this compact machine has impressed me in many ways while also exposing a few areas for improvement. Designed for coffee enthusiasts who crave barista-quality results, the Bambino promises a lot‚Äîand it mostly delivers.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the Bambino exudes elegance. Its brushed stainless steel exterior gives it a sleek and modern look, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen setup. Measuring just 13.7"" in depth and 6.3"" in width, it takes up very little counter space. This compact size is a blessing for small kitchens or apartments. However, I noticed that some of the components, like the tamper, feel a bit lightweight, almost bordering on flimsy. Despite this, the machine remains sturdy and well-constructed.

**Features**

This espresso maker is loaded with features that cater to both beginners and seasoned coffee lovers. The automatic steam wand, for instance, is a standout. It allows you to adjust the milk temperature and texture, making it easier to create microfoam for latte art. The low-pressure pre-infusion ensures even extraction, while the digital temperature control (PID) maintains the optimal brewing temperature. One feature I found particularly exciting is the thermojet technology, which heats up the machine in just three seconds. Gone are the days of waiting for your coffee maker to warm up!

[Check Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b1jppg2l/)

**Brewing Performance**

The Bambino is a powerhouse when it comes to brewing espresso. I experimented with both single and double shots, and the results were consistently robust and flavorful. The 54mm portafilter ensures full-bodied espresso, a feature I really appreciated during my taste tests. However, the lack of a built-in grinder means you‚Äôll need to invest in a separate one, which adds to the cost and counter space requirements.

**Coffee Quality**

The quality of coffee produced is stellar. I tried various beans and grind sizes, and while it took a bit of trial and error to get the perfect shot, the Bambino consistently delivered rich, aromatic espresso. The digital temperature control played a huge role in maintaining consistency, which is vital for achieving that perfect cup.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

Milk frothing is where the Bambino truly shines. The steam wand is automatic yet customizable, allowing you to adjust the milk‚Äôs texture to your liking. I managed to create smooth microfoam that enhanced my lattes and cappuccinos. The wand‚Äôs power is surprisingly strong for such a small machine, making it a joy to use. My niece even tried her hand at frothing milk and was thrilled to successfully make her first latte art!

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank, while compact, holds a decent amount of water for multiple shots. Positioned at the back, it‚Äôs detachable and easy to refill. However, its location can be a bit inconvenient if the machine is placed under low-hanging cabinets, as you‚Äôll need to pull it out to access the tank.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

One of my favorite aspects of the Bambino is its user-friendly cleaning process. The drip tray and portafilter are easy to remove and wash. The machine also features an automatic cleaning cycle, which can be activated with the press of a button. However, the small drip tray fills up quickly, requiring frequent emptying‚Äîa minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Thanks to the thermojet heating system, the Bambino is incredibly energy-efficient. It heats up in mere seconds and powers down automatically when not in use. As for noise, it‚Äôs quieter than many other espresso machines I‚Äôve used, which is a bonus for early mornings when the rest of the household is still asleep.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville offers a one-year limited warranty for the Bambino. While I haven‚Äôt had to contact customer support yet, the warranty provides some peace of mind. The included interactive setup guide through the Tilt app was also a helpful touch during the initial setup.

**Advantages**

* Heats up in just three seconds, saving time in the mornings.
* Compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens.
* Automatic steam wand simplifies milk frothing for beginners.
* Consistently produces rich, full-bodied espresso.
* Easy-to-use controls and quick cleaning process.

**Shortcomings**

* No built-in grinder, requiring a separate purchase.
* Some parts feel less durable, like the included tamper.
* Small drip tray needs frequent emptying.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Breville Bambino to other espresso machines in its category, a few alternatives come to mind. The De'Longhi Dedica is another compact option with a similar price range, but it lacks the advanced milk frothing capabilities of the Bambino. On the higher end, the Gaggia Classic Pro offers more robust construction and manual control but takes up more space and lacks the Bambino‚Äôs rapid heat-up feature. If you value quick setup and ease of use, the Bambino is a clear winner.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, the Breville Bambino offers excellent value for its price. It bridges the gap between entry-level and professional espresso machines, making it a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts. While the absence of a built-in grinder is a drawback, the overall quality and convenience justify its cost.

1iyd049,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iyd049/can_waterdrop_wdg2w_reverse_osmosis_system_really/,Can Waterdrop WD-G2-W reverse osmosis system really transform your water quality? A detailed review for those considering this tankless water filtration system,"Testing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W reverse osmosis system in my own home has been an enlightening experience. With its innovative tankless design and advanced filtration technology, this under-sink water filtration system boasts compact efficiency and promises to deliver cleaner, purer water. My expectations were high, but I was also curious about any potential drawbacks. Here's my take after using it extensively.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The composite filtration system in the Waterdrop WD-G2-W is quite impressive. It combines multiple layers to target a wide range of contaminants, including TDS (total dissolved solids), PFAS, PFOA, PFOS, and more. I tested the water quality using a TDS meter, and the results were consistently around 10-15 ppm, down from my city water's 140 ppm. That‚Äôs a dramatic improvement! The water tastes crisp, clean, and honestly, better than bottled water. Knowing that harmful chemicals and heavy metals are significantly reduced gives peace of mind, especially when preparing food or making beverages.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Installing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W was surprisingly straightforward. I‚Äôm not a professional plumber, but the instructions were clear, and the connections fit securely. The twist-and-pull design for replacing filters is a blessing‚Äîno wrestling with tight cartridges! However, you will need an electrical outlet under your sink, which might require some adjustments in older homes.

One hiccup I encountered was drilling a hole in the countertop for the faucet. If you don‚Äôt already have a pre-drilled hole, this might be a task for a professional. Luckily, my countertop had a spare hole from an old soap dispenser. The process of replacing filters is quick and mess-free, taking less than five minutes.

[View Waterdrop WD-G2-W sale info on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b082cz9xz9/)

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The Waterdrop WD-G2-W delivers a flow rate of 0.28 gallons per minute, which means you can fill a glass in about 12 seconds. While this may not sound lightning-fast, it‚Äôs definitely an upgrade from my old tank-based RO system that required pre-filling a tank. However, there is a slight delay before the water reaches its optimal purity if the system has been idle. A small trade-off for the tankless design, but something to keep in mind.

**Capacity & Suitability**

With a daily capacity of 400 gallons, the unit is suitable for families or households that consume a lot of drinking water. It‚Äôs also a great choice for avid cooks or coffee enthusiasts like myself. Instead of constantly buying and storing bottled water, this system provides a continuous supply of filtered water right at your sink.

**Features**

One standout feature is the tankless design. Not only does it save a significant amount of under-sink space, but it also eliminates the risk of bacterial growth that can occur in traditional RO tanks. The compact design fits snugly under my sink, leaving room for cleaning supplies. The system also boasts a 1:1 pure-to-drain ratio, which is more efficient than many competitors that waste up to three gallons for every gallon filtered.

Another feature I appreciated is the quiet operation. Although the initial filtration process produces a soft hum, it‚Äôs not intrusive. My previous system sounded like a small jet engine, so this was a welcome change.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

The filters in the Waterdrop WD-G2-W have a lifespan of 12 months, depending on usage and water quality. While the replacement filters are a bit pricey, the convenience and performance make up for it. Plus, the system provides a reminder when it‚Äôs time to change the filters, so there‚Äôs no second-guessing.

**Certifications**

The Waterdrop WD-G2-W is FCC listed, which underscores its safety and reliability. It‚Äôs reassuring to know the materials used are lead-free and meet strict quality standards. For those concerned about health and safety, these certifications are a significant bonus.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a one-year warranty, which is standard for most filtration systems. I haven‚Äôt had to use customer service yet, but other reviews suggest that Waterdrop is responsive and accommodating.

**Good Points**

* Compact, tankless design saves under-sink space.
* Excellent water quality with reduced TDS and contaminants.
* Easy installation and quick filter replacement.
* Quiet operation with eco-friendly water-saving features.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Water takes a moment to reach optimal purity after being idle.
* Requires an electrical outlet under the sink.
* Replacement filters are on the expensive side.

**Alternative Offerings**

Comparing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W to similar systems like the APEC ROES-PH75 or the iSpring RCC7, the tankless design is a game-changer. Traditional systems with tanks are bulkier and prone to bacterial growth, which the Waterdrop avoids entirely. While the APEC system includes a remineralization filter for adding healthy minerals back into the water, the Waterdrop focuses on pure filtration. If you‚Äôre short on space or prefer a modern, streamlined design, the Waterdrop system outshines its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

While the initial investment might seem steep, the system‚Äôs efficiency and long-term savings on bottled water make it worth every penny. The 1:1 pure-to-drain ratio ensures minimal water waste, which is not only cost-effective but also eco-friendly. Given the durability and performance, this system offers excellent value for the price.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had been having issues with very inconsistent brewing. Grind and quantity adjustments were helping little to correct the inconsistent brewing and we always use fresh beans, maintainn the infuser o-rings, etc. Ultimately replaced the infuser and brew consistency immediately improved.  
Now about a year later I see the same exact spot on the infuser is broken. Coffee quality has gotten inconsistent; watery pucks, machine sometimes locks-up as if insufficient pressure to brew. **Any ideas as to why this collar is breaking off the infuser twice?**

The transmission assembly seems to be a bit loose, but not sure how tight it's supposed to sit in the machine. I don't see any obvious issues of wear in the track and it's hard to inspect the transmission much even with the machine opened. Wondering if some misalignment with the transmission could be creating this issue with breaking the infuser?

1iyctar,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1iyctar/my_work_colleague_has_bpd_and_i_love_her_what/,My work colleague has BPD and I love her. What should I do?,"Hi everyone!  I wanted to start by saying I do not have BPD, but I understand it well since I was in a three year relationship with someone who had it over 10 years ago.  This is going to be a long post, so I apologize in advance, but it is necessary for me to tell the whole story in order to get proper advice.  Let's begin.

I work for a large company in public relations.  I've worked at this company now for 7 years and it's a great job.  About 3 years ago, this lovely woman (who I'll refer to as ""The Colleague"") began working in the office down the hall.  She seemed shy, didn't talk to most people at work, but was an incredibly creative problem solver.

On one of her projects, she made some mistakes and another coworker made some negative comments toward her.  That day when I entered the break room, I found her crying over her lunch.  She explained to me what had happened and she thought everyone at work hated her.  I told her she is wonderfully creative,  does an excellent job, and it's okay to make mistakes.    She cried more, but thanked me for my kind words.

Over the next few months, she would regularly go out of her way to see me.  She'd come into my office to talk.  She kept asking if we could be friends.  I didn't agree right away because at the time, I was dating someone who had strong negative feelings toward the idea of me having female friends.  Eventually, that relationship didn't work out and my girlfriend broke up with me.  After many months of The Colleague being persistent, I agreed to be her friend.  She gave me a hug.  

Over the next few weeks, she kept asking me if we could meet outside of work.  I was lonely and didn't mind the friendly companionship, so I agreed to meet her at a coffee shop.  There, we talked for over four hours.  It was almost like we were old childhood friends, but this was the first time I was getting to know her.

We talked constantly after that at work.  She came into my office more frequently, and we'd often share our interests with one another.  It was like she loved everything that I loved.  A few weeks later, I asked her if she'd like to go to a carnival with me.  She gave me a really big hug and said, ""YES!"".  She seemed very excited about it.

We had an amazing time together at the carnival.  We are funnel cakes, played games, and watched the circus performers do flips.  It was so much fun!  We talked about her hobbies, pottery she was making, and her love of music.  She even bought a milkshake for me.  It was very kind.  At the end of the night, I walked her back to her car, she gave me another huge hug, and that's when something confusing happened for me.

She looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Please keep being my friend.  You are the best friend I've ever had"".

The reason this confuses me was that I had no intention of dissolving this friendship.  I wasn't sure why she needed that reassurance, at least at the time.

Things continued to be good between us at work, but began getting a little flirty on her end.  She would casually brush up against me a lot, tell me dirty jokes and then punch me in the arm when I laughed, and send me pictures of erotic memes.  She began texting me non-stop.  I'd always respond, but sometimes I was in a meeting and couldn't respond quickly.  She approached me one day after one of these meetings and told me it annoyed her that I was too busy to respond.  I apologized, but explained that I had no choice while in a meeting.  She stopped talking to me for a few days.  I still really liked her and couldn't understand why she would stop talking to me when before, she was so excited to be around me all the time.

Eventually, she started following me in the office again.  One day, she pulled me into a break room, gave me a giant hug, and invited me to dinner at a delicious Japanese restaurant.  Since our last two outings were great, I agreed to go.  It was wonderful.  We had the most intimate conversations over dinner.  We talked about past relationships and why they failed.  We talked about love.  We talked about sex.  We talked about life lessons we've learned and dreams we wanted to accomplish.  It was more intimate than any conversation I've ever had in any relationship I had ever been in and this wasn't even an official date.  We were just a couple of friends out for a nice dinner together.

After the meal, we went for a walk through the city.  We saw the harbor lights and talked about being lost in their beautiful glow.  At that moment, she looked at me with the most dreamy stare and went in for the longest hug I had ever experienced.  It lasted at least five minutes, but seemed like and eternity.  

During the hug, she said, ""Please promise you'll never leave me.  Everyone leaves me.  I think you're different, but I'm afraid.""

I don't know why I felt the feelings that I felt in that moment, but my heart couldn't say no.  She then looked at me like she wanted me to kiss her.  Normally, I wouldn't have thought twice, but this was not a date.  It was something else.  At that time, I wasn't sure what, but I knew I was feeling things toward her that I've never felt before.  The beginning of what I thought was a true twin-flame.

The next day at work, it was difficult to focus.  I couldn't stop thinking about how strangely surreal the night before was.  I was weighing a lot of thoughts surrounding what I should do.  Should I ask her out?  Will it be weird because we are work colleagues?  Is she feeling the same things I'm feeling?  After work that day, we walked out to the parking lot together.  She was flirting with me the whole way.  I thought that if she is flirting, she must want to go out on an official date!

I made the decision to ask her out properly.  Her reaction was visceral!  There was fear in her eyes.

She said in a terribly frightened voice, ""No!  Not you!""

I told her I thought we had chemistry and that we connected on a deeply personal level.  She slapped me and told me very angrily that she couldn't be in a relationship and that everything she touches get ruined.  She said she didn't want to ruin me too.

After that, she became very distant.  She avoided talking to me, stopped responding to my texts, and no longer invited me out.  She went an entire month of no contact with me.  I was so confused.  I really thought there was something there.  However, I made a promise.  I promised I would be there for her, so I didn't give up.  The more I pushed in, the more she pulled away.  Eventually, she told me in a way I could understand that being there for her meant that she needed to pull away.  I backed off, but just sent occasional reminders that I still cared.

Months later, things seem to have normalized.  We still talk at work, but not much more beyond that.  The  intermittent flirty exchanges still sometimes happen and I think and hope she still knows how I feel.  She would sometimes compare me to other friends in my presence.  I understand now that she does this not because she wants to make me feel bad, but because she doesn't want to lose me.  It's a test to see if I'll stay.  

During all this time gone by, I put the puzzle pieces together.  I understand more than the average person about BPD, but I need some perspective from others that know it first hand.  What should I do?  I really do care about her.  She is amazing in so many ways.  I know she feels terrible inside.  I know she is hurting.  I would hug her in the dark and tell her everything going to be okay if it could heal her pain even for a moment.  Should I give her time?  Should I ask her out again?  I will never know if she is truly my twin-flame unless I try.  I'm willing to try.",1,1740536469.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False
1iycsn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1iycsn2/recently_diagnosed_hsv2/,Recently diagnosed HSV-2,"38yr old male, recently diagnosed with HSV-2 officially 48 days ago (Jan 7) but have been having symptoms since a week after my first Initial encounter with the person I suspect passed the infection on to me, which has been on-going since 103 days ago (Dec 12)

I‚Äôve been tested for chlamedia/ gonorrhoea, and had my blood work pulled for pretty much everything you can think of which is when they found the HSV-2 igg. (That‚Äôs literally all the info they gave me)

My symptoms from the beginning have been extreme itching in the genitalia area, and severe burning in the shaft of my junk. But no outbreaks or anything has occurred this whole time. Truthfully I woulda suspected it to be chlamedia‚Ä¶

So I have been only experiencing extreme itching and a general feeling of discomfort 24/7.
It‚Äôs amazing how little the doctors understand this infection, so I am completely stumped. It‚Äôs making me begin to wonder if:
1. I‚Äôve had this already in my system for a very long time and just didn‚Äôt no, looking back thru life there a little signs here and there, but impossible to know.
2. Maybe I have something else going on?

Prior to learning I was HSV-2 positive from the bloodwork the hospital took, I ran 3 long rounds of antibiotics for chlamedia and ghonorrhea, and thought maaaaybe I built an immunity to them and that‚Äôs why my results were coming back negative, but who knows and maybe the treatment just wasn‚Äôt working to kill the STI.

Now I‚Äôm in a constant state of itching around the testicals, and penis shaft with a weird on/off burning inside the head of the penis this is driving me absolutely nuts. The itching is what is killing me the worst. It just doesn‚Äôt go away. Sometimes when I sleep it will turn off for a but usually wakes me in the night badly. It‚Äôs not until I wake up and have a coffee and get active and go to the gym that it reignites and gets overwhelming again for the day.

And I have a tight feeling in between my thighs (inside legs) on either side of my gentials but in my legs that are always feeling tight like an infection (which I‚Äôm sure it is) the doctor originally reported when he first suspected I had this that my lymph nodes on either side of my gentials were swollen which is another common sign he told me‚Ä¶

Has anyone other guys out there experienced any of this? Again- NO outbreaks but seems like non-stops side effects. I don‚Äôt see much guys talking on here‚Ä¶

I also did a 10 day run of Valacyclovir (4 pills/ twice daily) at the very start of being diagnosed on Jan 7th 2025, and am now on a permanent dose of x2 Valacyclovir daily for life just to be careful. Doesn‚Äôt seem to really help or do anything.

I also took that L-lysine stuff at first for a few weeks too. But didn‚Äôt really get any results either.

Any input helps as I‚Äôm completely lost‚Ä¶",1,1740536413.0,Herpes,4,1.0,False

I used to go on long hikes, golf, ski, etc. I had two healthy pregnancies and worked as a bedside nurse up until a week before giving birth without an issue. When I was pregnant with my second, I hiked with my first on my back. I am a bedside med-surg nurse and I never had a problem working 4 (12-hour) shifts in a row! And then I would go golfing after my 4th shift. I would commonly work overtime and spent my days off being active. Nothing ever stopped me before now! 


A year and a half ago I had horrible pelvic pain that sent me to the ER (I‚Äôm not one to go to an ER for anything but I couldn‚Äôt walk.) ER did a pelvic ultrasound to make sure my mirena IUD was in place- it was- and a UA. Everything negative. I followed up with my GYN who did swabs, again negative, and they told me everything was fine. Pain went away so I just kept going. I‚Äôm not sure if this incident has anything to do with my current symptoms but they became noticeable shortly after. 

It all started with this low-grade exhaustion. I would need more coffee to get through my day. The exhaustion started getting worse slowly. Over the summer, I had difficulty driving long distances and needed several cups of coffee to get through one shift. I was exhausted after 2 shifts in a row and could no longer do overtime. Over the summer we went on a family vacation, I had a difficult time driving the long distance, a trip I have made several times alone before. By the end of the summer, I was having a difficult time just doing basic things (shaving, doing my nails and hair, tidying the house, etc.) but figured it was just stress and a lack of sleep. 


In the fall, more symptoms started becoming noticeable. Numbness and tingling of my hands, especially when I held them up to type or drive. They would also turn pale or blue at times. Hair loss- I got a large bald spot on the front of my head. My nails were brittle and started breaking. Lightheadedness especially when I would bend down to pick something up. Shortness of breath on exertion at times. I went to a doctor who ran basic urine and blood tests. All negative except low vitamin D. She told me I was just depressed and didn‚Äôt run anything else. 


I started taking a vitamin D supplement that helped for a few weeks but now the symptoms are worse than ever! I can barely get through the day. I spend most days on the couch. If I eat something fatty, I feel like I‚Äôm drugged for over 24 hours I can barely open my eyes or stand up. It‚Äôs hard for me to stand up even long enough to wash my hair. I am so exhausted all the time! I need caffeine pills, supplements and healthy foods just to stay awake. Forget about doing anything productive! I feel like I can‚Äôt even watch my kids at this point. My fianc√© is sacrificing his business to do all the cooking, cleaning and childcare right now but this can‚Äôt continue for much longer. After I work 2 days in a row I‚Äôm bedbound the next day. 


Over the last couple of weeks my symptoms started to scare me with the addition of incontinence- both bowel and bladder. I don‚Äôt even feel like I have to go or notice that I went. It happened maybe 6 times in the last month. My migraines are also getting worse. I ate one bad meal and slept for most of the next day. I looked like I took Benadryl- that‚Äôs how zonked out I was from that one meal (a burger and fries.) 


I found a new doctor that wants me to do a sleep study and autoimmune tests (haven‚Äôt went to the lab yet but will soon.) I just want someone to point me in the right direction. What kind of specialist should I see? What kind of tests should I have done? What supplements should I take to get through the day while I wait for tests? Any idea of what this could be?
