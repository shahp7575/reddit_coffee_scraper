Had bad luck this night: Everest was down so we had to re-schedule for late at night. FoP went down while we were on it, they took us to another location and we rode but it took 60 minutes start to finish to ride. 

When we went back to Everest at the end of the night we were on the ride ready to go and it went down and they pulled everyone off. It was 6:30pm (7pm park close). We ate at Yak & Yeti QS and on the way out of the park I walked up to Guest Relations and explained (very nicely) our luck for the evening. I randomly go the head person in charge and she said they hadn't had a day like that in a long time. She said, ""Where are you going tomorrow, I'll get you any ride you want."" I said ""We'd really like to ride Guardians at Epcot."" She said, ""No problem,"" and booked us with an anytime experience redemption for Guardians.

**MONDAY OCTOBER 21**  
Go Home 

**GENERAL THOUGHTS**

We valued rest time each day in the middle of the day when the parks are the most intense but we realize that early wake-up times on vacation aren't for everyone. 

We don't view LLMP LLSP as ""extra costs."" We view them as necessary and add that cost to the total cost of the trip and don't go to Disney until we can afford them as part of the trip. 

Our longest standby waits were 21 min (Tiana during MNSSHP) and 30 min (Toy Story Mania). 

**MNSSHP THOUGHTS**

Best Disney experience we've ever had. 

Wait times on EVERY ride were at least 50% what the posted wait time was. Just get in line! What most people don't process is that without the LL queue, the lines move so much faster so even when the lines looks long, it's not. 

We didn't trick or treat much because we can get candy anywhere. 

The parade was so so so cool. Everyone loved it. 

Highly suggest starting your ""ride"" portion of the night at Cadavar Dan's and working your way from there to HM and into Fantasyland then to Tron. This was SO MEMORABLE. The theming was the best. 

Riding Tron at night is amazing but make sure you see my note about the standby time after the second parade lets out.

# Dante’s Dimension, The next evening, Inside the Maiju temple, Training room,

# Dante and Gwen are sparring with two robotic golems. Unfortunately, they weren’t doing so well. The golems were fighting in complete sync while Dante and Gwen couldn’t hit them at all.

# “Uh, next time, let’s put the robots on level one. Level two hurts.” Dante says as he struggles to stand.

# “Yep, this is too much for a test run.” Gwen said.

# The golems stood over Gwen and tried to grab her. Dante activates his gauntlet and transforms into Comix, a silver alien that radiated a powerful aura.

# “Good to know that worked. Transforming from one to another is very useful.” He said before rushing to Gwen’s aid. Stopping behind her, Dante punched the golem, launching it backward into a wall.  “Woah, That’s some power.” He said surprised.

# “So, this is the new transformation.”

# “Yep, and it feels so powerful.” Dante said before rushing to the second golem. Appearing in front of it, he punched, and an energy blast shot from his fist, destroying the golem. “Woah, that’s some power.” Dante thought to himself.

# “System shutdown! Extensive damage detected. System shutdown!”

# “Oops,” Dante said.

# “Yeah, let’s save this one for the direst situations. Don’t want to destroy a city in the process of saving it.” Gwen said.

# “Agreed,” Dante said as he reverted to normal. “So, what’s next?” He asked as he walked over to Gwen.

# “Let’s see. We did combat training, body training, mental fortifying, and went through some of your alien transformations. All there’s left is to tour the temple and makeshift tunnels throughout the city.” Gwen said.

# “Cool, let’s g…

# Dante’s phone suddenly rings. On the screen, says “MOM”.

# “You’re not going to answer. This is the ninth time since this morning. What if it’s an emergency.” Gwen said.

# “Knowing my mother, that emergency is me not coming home last night. Hell, I’m surprised she haven’t call you, yet, to find me.”

# Suddenly, Gwen’s phone rang. Gwen shouts and tosses her phone on the ground. On its screen read “ER,”. Dante picks up the phone and sees “ER”.

# “ER? Eric? Why’d you scream?”

# “Really? Did you just ask that? You know I rejected him yesterday.”

# “Riiight,” Dante said placing his hand on his face.

# “Yeah, and who knows what he wants after that rejection?”

# “Let’s find out.” Dante said as he answered the phone. “Dante, you ass!” Gwen mouths. “Hello,”

# “Gwen! What took you so long to answer? We have a problem.”

# “What’s wrong?” Gwen said.

# “I don’t know. But D’s mom just called my mom. I think Dante ran away from home. Do you have any idea where he might be?” Eric said.

# “Hm, No. I don’t know where he might be.” Gwen said as Dante silently asks questions.

# “You… okay? Wait a minute, you’re with Dante right now. Aren’t you?” Eric said. Dante and Gwen looked at the phone worriedly.

# “Nooooo,” Gwen said.

# “Gwen, really? I know you better than you think. I know when you’re lying. Dante, are you there? Listen, call your parents. They are worried.” Eric said.

# “Emergency! Emergency! Soul essence detected,” The computer said.

# “The computer is working again. That was quick.” Dante said.

# “Sorry, Eric. I’ll call you later.” Gwen said as she hung up the phone. “Computer, where is it.” She asked.

# “Locating,” it said as it pulled up a large 3d holographic globe. “Located, Las Vegas. Soul 8954, Alurisian, beings of seduction.”

# “Seduction? Are you serious? I would hate to think what a person could do with that kind of power.” Gwen said as she looked at Dante.

# “Oh, come on, Gwen. I told you I was affected by the same thing as you.” Dante said.

# “Okay, I believe you.” Gwen said, sarcastically.

# “Oh please, you and I both enjoyed it.” Dante said. “And, if I remember correctly, you especially were overactive.” Dante whispered in Gwen’s ear as he embraced Gwen from behind. Gwen blushed red. “Oh, blushing, are we? I’m glad.”

# “Really?” Gwen asked.

# “Of course, It’s just one more thing to love about you.” Dante answered before kissing her on the cheek. Gwen smiled as her cheeks became redder.

# “Okay, I think we need to focus on getting to Las Vegas.” Gwen said.

# “Right, I’m assuming that we would fly there using Fal. Or we could run there like I did last night.”

# “No, you were completely wiped after getting to Paris. We need a better way.”

# “Would you like me to start the Maiju transport vehicle?” The computer said.

# “What?” Dante and Gwen said simultaneously.

# “This way,” the computer as a holographic woman appeared, directing them to an opening in the wall. Cautiously following the holographic woman, Dante and Gwen find themselves inside a hangar, filled with many types of vehicles. From private jet to futuristic cars, only one car stood out to both. It was burgundy with a black symbol like the one on the gauntlet’s screen. “Pleased to see you’re excited with your gift. Made with the most advanced tech the Maiju created, this car can traverse any type of terrain.”

# “It’s beautiful,” Gwen said as she touched it.

# “Glad to hear that. Cause we’re in the process of making you one. It’ll just be another few hours. In the meantime, the stealth jet is ready for you.”

# “Thank you,” Gwen said. “Man, this computer system is amazing.” She thought to herself as they walked onto the stealth jet.

# At the same time, Dante’s mom is sitting worriedly at Eric’s house. Bringing her some coffee, Eric’s mom and dad did their best to calm her.

# “Thank you. And I’m sorry to bring you into our mess.” Janice said as she picked up the mug.

# “Oh, you’re welcome, sweetie. It’s alright. You and your family are like our family. In times of crisis, you can always come to us whenever there’s trouble.” Eric’s mother said.

# “Now, what exactly happened? Why did Dante runaway?” Eric’s father said.

# Janice explained everything to Eric’s parents. Eric then walked into the room with his phone in his hand. “I got through to Gwen, and she and Dante appear to be safe. But I don’t know where they are. She wouldn’t tell me. However, I did hear an alarm in the background just before she hung up.” He said.

# “Can you try her again?” Janice asked.

# “Sure,” Eric answered as he dialed Gwen’s number.

# “Eric, it really isn’t the best time right now. Can I call you back later?” Gwen said as she answered the phone.

#  “What are you doing?” Eric said.

# “Uh, homework. Yeah, homework.” Gwen said.

# “Oh okay, what did you get for our history class?”  Eric asked.

# “The Louisiana Purchase.”

# “She’s lying. We didn’t have homework for that class. Not to mention, we haven’t even touched the Louisiana Purchase yet.” Eric whispers.

# “She must be covering for Dante. Maybe he’s with her.” Eric’s mother said.

# “If only we could track her location.” Dante’s mother said.

# “Eric, hang up the phone.”

# “Why dad?” Eric asked as he placed the phone on mute.

# “Because I’m using the police department’s cell phone tracking system they’ve installed on my phone, and it says they’re nowhere to be found.  It’s like they’re making contact from the afterlife.” Eric’s dad said. Janice starts crying out as Eric’s mom gives him a scolding expression.

# “No, I’m not saying he’s dead, I just saying there’s someplace untraceable by the system.”

# “Dear, how about you put an amber alert?” Eric’s mother said.

# “No, don’t do that. I don’t want people to think I’m a bad mother who can’t keep up with her child. I have some contacts I can use. Just don’t put out an amber alert.” Janice said as she wipes her tears. She gets up and walks out the door.

# “Contacts?” Eric and his parents thought to themselves. Eric, then, takes his phone off mute and places it to his ears. However, all he hears is a dial tone.

# “She must’ve hung up. She has been acting strange. I hope my confession doesn’t have anything to do with it. Stupid! Stupid!” He thought to himself as he went to his room.

# Arriving in Las Vegas,

# The stealth jet landed in an old building with a huge hole in its roof. Opening, Dante and Gwen walked out shocked by their surroundings.

# “You know I expected Las Vegas to be a lot brighter and louder.” Dante said.

# “We’re probably on the outskirts of town. Where all the crime happens. So, we should be careful.”

# “Right, but what do we do about the jet. What if someone comes in this building.”

# “You’re right, they could strip it for parts. Let’s see if it has a camouflage mode.” Gwen said as she walked back in.

# “Camouflage mode, activated.” The jet’s computer said.

# “Cool, computer do you have any change of clothes for us.”

# “Please stand still.” It said as it scanned Dante and Gwen. “Clothing pods should arrive in three minutes.”

# “Clothing pods?” Dante and Gwen thought to themselves.

# Three minutes later, Two large tubes lands beside the jet. Walking outside to the tubes, Dante and Gwen notices insignias on the tubes are like their own. Standing in front of their insignias, the tubes scan the two of them.  Opening, the tubes reveal two custom-made outfits. Gwen’s outfit was a black shirt, with one sleeve removed, and pair of black tights and boots. Along with a watch. However, Dante had a black jacket with a burgundy sleeveless shirt underneath, and a black pair of cargo pants and shoes.

# “Wow, this is crazy.” Dante said as he took off his school shirt.

# “Yeah, this is something I would definitely wear. And these boots are so black like they came from the darkness themselves.” Gwen said.

# “Pfft! Really?” Dante said as he held back his laugh.

# “You know what I mean. But is it okay to go out wearing this. Won’t we draw attention.”

# “Yeah, but we already stand out.”

# “How?”

# “Really, we’re two teenagers in Vegas during the school year. And that doesn’t seem odd to you. Hell, do they even have schools in Vegas?”

# “Okay, you have a point. But, with these clothes, won’t it be hard to search for the Soul?”

# “Not as hard to search for it in school uniforms or workout clothes.” Dante said he grabbed his shoes. He stepped into them, and they adjusted to fit him perfectly. “See, now do I look strange.” Dante said as he stepped in front of Gwen, who was still contemplating wearing her shirt.

# “Not bad,”

# Suddenly, another pod landed beside Gwen’s pod. She stepped in front of the pod, and it opened. Inside, there was a black short-sleeved shirt with a dark purple jacket. On the jacket, a note that read “Press the button”.  Gwen looked for a button. Finding it on the side of the pod, Gwen pressed it, activating a 3d hologram.

# “Hello, I am CAIN. One of the thirteen holographic representatives between you and the Maiju temple’s computer. I will be the one in charge of your clothing and personal matters. And I’m sorry to say I’ve messed up. I gave you the wrong top for your outfit. That one sleeve top was a prototype armor designed to protect you from energy weapons. While this one is designed to protect from primitive weapons like guns and knives.”

# “What? These flimsy clothes are supposed to protect us from bullets.” Gwen said, shocked.

# “Yes. Though they may look flimsy, they’re made from metallic threads capable of absorbing and redistributing kinetic energy, making it completely bullet proof. It’s the same metal we used to make all your vehicles and tools. Speaking of,” the inside of the tube turns, revealing two belts. “These belts are your locator beacons so we can keep track of you. Always keep these on you. And, like your watch and his gauntlet, it will allow you to communicate with each other or the Maiju temple.”

# Dante and Gwen were left speechless. The capabilities of the Maiju temples and their computers seem endless. And they oversaw all of them.

# After getting dressed, Gwen walked over to Dante.

# “Here, put this behind your ear.” She said as she held out her hand, revealing a miniature device.

# “What is it?” Dante asked, picking it up and placing it where she said.

# “A long-range communication device. Cain gave it to me after you left. He says it’ll allow us to communicate both telepathically and verbally with each other.”

# “So, if I think you look sexy in that outfit, you’ll hear it.” Dante said telepathically.

# Gwen blushed red. “Crap, this is a bad idea.” She thought.

# “Hmm, why is that?” Dante thought as he grinned and got closer to her.

# Gwen blushed redder. “No, We can’t right now. We have to find that soul and contain it before someone gets it by accident.” Gwen said as she pushed Dante away.

# “Right, let’s go.” Dante said as he snapped out of it.

# “Thank goodness, I almost fell for his primal attitude again. I have to be careful.” Gwen thought as she walked away.

# “Primal? I like that. But let’s not forget you have that Primal attitude too.” he said as he walked past her.

# Walking out of the building, Dante and Gwen immediately see five children playing with a small creature in the street. They started walking over to see what they were playing with until they saw a runaway truck headed straight for them.  Reacting as fast as they could, Dante transformed into Panthera and Gwen cast a speed enhancement spell on herself. Grabbing all the children, Dante quickly evaded with two while Gwen jumped up with the rest. Unfortunately, the truck ran over the creature as it passed.

# “Oh no,” one of the children said as Gwen landed.

# “Mr. Squeaky,” one of the girls shouted as they ran back into the streets.

# “Mr. squeaky?” Dante said as he followed behind the girls.

# “Nice work,” Gwen said as Dante approached.

# “Yeah, you too. But I still feel bad. I couldn’t save their… pet?” Dante said as Mr. Squeaky reformed from its corpse. It was a pink, chubby dinosaur-like creature that walked on four legs. Its eyes were big and glowed a pink color. Suddenly, Gwen watch and bracelet goes off. Gwen pressed a button on her bracelet.

# “Soul Detected, Alurisian. Threat level one, contain immediately.” It said.

# “WHAT!” Gwen and Dante said as they looked at the creature. Suddenly, the creature began to grow bigger.

# “What in the Maiju!” Dante said as it grew as tall and big as a four-story building.

# “Really?” Gwen asked as she formed a barrier around them as the creature swung its tail. “Dante! Get those kids away from here!”  she yelled.

# “Right,” Dante said as he picked up one of the kids and ran away. Almost instantly, Dante came back and grabbed another kid and ran away with her.  He repeated this process until only Gwen was left.

# “I’m so happy that you chose an alien with super speed. Even though we evacuated the kids, we should go somewhere without any bystanders.” Gwen said as Dante lifted her up into his arms.

# “Right, hold on tight.” He said before running around the creature. Dante whistles. “Hey, Mr. Squeaky. Let’s play tag.” He yells before running away.  The creature roared and chased after him.  Surprisingly, the creature was keeping up with Dante. Every few steps, it tried to take a bite out of Dante, making him run all over the city. But he did manage not to go into the heavily populated area. Then, the creature stopped and roared loudly. Then, the creature began to split in two and ran off in two different directions. “Oh, come on! Can we just get a break?” Dante yelled.

# “Dante, you go after the one heading for the casinos, I’ll stay here and try to keep this contained.” Gwen said.

# “Alright, good luck.” Dante said as he put Gwen down on the top of an apartment building.

# “You too,” she said as she kissed him on the cheek. Dante, then, took off after the one who went to the casinos. “Okay, Gwen, let’s see if these spells are worth it.” she thought to herself as she reached for her hoverboard. “Crap, I left it back at the temple. Stupid!” she said as she touched her forehead. “No better time than the present to learn how to fly,” she said. Gathering magical power in her hands, she began to feel a strange, nostalgic power around her. As her hands shined with energy, she chanted a flight spell Naabu gave to her. Lifting her up, the magical power flung Gwen forward. Then, it surrounded her entire body, keeping her in the air.

#   Roaring loudly, the creature was looking for its prey, attracting the attention of everyone; news crews, police officers, and anyone who had a phone.

# “Great, now I have to deal with publicity. Man, today is not my day.” Dante said as he stopped on top of a casino. Taking a starting position, Dante focused on one thing. Stopping this soul from causing anymore destruction. Taking his first step, Dante propelled forward, creating a powerful, loud sonic boom. Every step slightly broke the ground as he zoomed down the street. As he reaches the Alurisian, Dante punches the beast, sending it flying away from the populated area. However, Dante stopped.

# “Ahhh! Fuck! That hurts!” Dante screams as he grips his right wrist.

# “Dante! Are you okay?” Gwen said over their communicator.

# “No, I think I broke my wrist. But, good news, I think I destr… A loud roar echoes the sky. Dante sighs. “Never mind, this thing is too much trouble.” He said as he transformed into Novex. He then, gathered flames to his hand and shot fire at the Alurisian, causing it major damage. Suddenly, it shrank a little. “Gwen! Its weakness is fire. Burn it.”

# “Got it!” Gwen said as she flew up to her Alurisian. “Avon Tsrub!(Nova Burst!)” she said as fire shot out from her hands. Hitting the Alurisian, it cried out and shrank a little. “Avon [meiuqer]()(nova requiem)!” She said as hundreds of music notes of fire appeared around her. Pointing towards the Alurisian, the music notes flew at the Alurisian, hitting him continuously. Shrunken down, the Alurisian returned to its original size. “Efrits’ chamber” she said. Instantly, a flame cage surrounded the Alurisian and floated up to Gwen. “Got mine. How are you doing?” Gwen said over her communicator.

# “Me too, but it’s being uncooperative.” Dante said as he tried to hold it still. “I’ll meet you back at the jet.” Dante said.

# “Okay,” Gwen answered as she flew back to the jet.

# Meanwhile, Dante was still struggling to hold the Alurisian, who was trying to get out of Dante flaming grip.

# “Freeze!” Dante hears. He looks up and sees he has been surrounded by the Las Vegas police department and a crowd.

# “Man, I don’t know if these people are brave or stupid.” Dante thought. “Hello, officer, everything is alright. I’m here on some official Galactic Agent business. I’m grabbing this wanted criminal who escaped to this rock.” Dante said.

# “Galactic police? I’ve never heard of that.”

# “That’s because your planet and species is so young.” Dante said. “Not to mention, I made it up.” Dante thought.

# “Dante, I’m flying the jet over your location. Be ready to jump.” Gwen said.

# “Okay,” Dante thought, nodding his head.

#  Suddenly, Dante and everyone in the crowd hears roaring, whirling sounds. Dante, realizing the jet, blasts off into the sky using his fire. As he slowly fell to the ground, the jet passed by underneath him, catching him and flying off.

#  Suddenly, Dante reverts back, causing him to fall off the jet. Quickly circling back, the jet catches Dante and the Alurisian.

# “Thanks, I thought I was going to die.” Dante said worriedly.

# “Dante! Are you crazy? Why did you transform back?”

# “I didn’t do it on purpose. I guess I ran out of stamina.” Dante explained.

# “What!? After two transformations! What did you do?” Gwen said as she grabbed his arm and examined the gauntlet.

# “I didn’t do anything. I’m probably more tired than I thought. We did come straight here from training. So, maybe transforming into Comix, drains a lot more energy than we thought.”

# “Okay, you have a point. But that just mean we have to find a way increase your stamina.” Gwen said.

# “Oh, and what do you have in mind?” Dante said as he pulled Gwen. Then, he kissed her passionately.

# “No, we have to get this soul locked up.” Gwen said as she pushed Dante.

# Suddenly, the jet slightly shakes.

# “What was that?” They asked simultaneously.

# “A Falconian has landed on top of the jet. Should I take evasive action?”

# “Yes!” “No!” Dante and Gwen said simultaneously.

# “Gwen, I know that’s one of the people who tried to recruit me for their team. She’s probably here for the soul. We can’t let them get it.”

# “Yeah, but if she was able to keep up with this jet, she could follow us back to the temple. I mean there’s still a lot we don’t know about that soul. It can probably see this jet in camouflage mode. So, it’s best to confront her now than later.” Gwen explained.

# “Alright but be careful I can’t transform now.” Dante said.

# “I’m always careful. Computer, land the jet in a nearby secluded place.”

# “Will they be okay by themselves?” Dante said as he put his jacket on.

# “Yeah, that spell is designed to keep them inside a trance no matter what happens. It’s not perfect but it should work.” Gwen said as she put on a mask.

# “Alright,” Dante said.

# Opening the cargo door, Dante and Gwen immediately see the Falconian standing there.

# “My, for someone who didn’t want to join our group, you made quite a mess. Las Vegas is burning to a crisp. The media knows of the existence of aliens. Not to mention, you set loose an alien soul. Which is impossible to revert into soul essence.” Ariel said.

# “No, it was already loose when we got there.” Gwen said.

# “Hell, it would’ve killed some kids if we hadn’t stepped in.”

# “What!? You’re saying it was already released before you got there. This is bad. Really bad.” She said as she pulled out her phone and texted a number.

# Dante and Gwen looked at each other.

# “Gwen, what do you think?” Dante asked, telepathically.

# “She’s acting strange. Maybe there’s something we don’t know.”

# “You think we need to get in contact with the temple.”

# “Maybe… I’ll go. You keep her occupied.” Gwen said.

# “Alright,”

# Sneaking away, Gwen went inside the jet to contact the temple. Done texting the number, Ariel looked back to see Dante.

# “Where did your little friend go?”

# “My girlfriend went inside to get out of the heat. She’s sensitive to the sunlight.” Dante said.

# “I’m not sensitive to sunlight. I just prefer to be in darkness. Can you blame me?” Gwen said over the communicator.

# Dante smiled.

# “What’s wrong with you? Why are you smiling?” Ariel said with a disgusted expression.

# “Oh, I was just thinking about what she might say if she had heard me. She so cute when she’s embarrassed.”

# “Okay, I don’t need to know about your love life. Anyway, give me the soul so we can lock it up.”

# “Lock it up?” Dante asked concerned.

# “Of course, you said it yourself. That soul tried to kill children. What else can we do besides lock it somewhere it can’t hurt anyone?”

# “Yeah, I know, but I don’t think you or your organization are the right people to have it. Its powers are dangerous in the wrong hands, and I don’t think your hands are the right hands.”

# “And your hands are better. Not to mention, where are you going to keep it. At your house? Mom, Dad, I found this puppy. Can we keep it?” Ariel said, teasingly. Dante laughed. “And, besides, we have the resources to keep it. You don’t.” Ariel said.

# “Dante, the temple’s computer has a way of reverting the soul back to its essence form. We just need to get back to the temple to do it.” Gwen said.

# “Alright, commence plan beta.” Dante replied.

# Gwen sighed. “Computer, lets head home.”

# “Are we leaving, Dante?”

# “Yes,”

# “Alright, throw him one of these.” The computer replied as a panel opened, revealing a badge and a bottle.

# “What are they?” Gwen asked.

# “The bottle is a stamina replenishing formula we made while you were dealing with the Alurisian. Don’t worry, it’s safe for his consumption. And the badge is a key to a nearby old Maiju outpost that was set up by the Maiju scouts. There are many set-ups spread across the world. And I’m sure he’ll find something there to get home.” The computer explained as Gwen grabbed the bottle and the badge.

# “Okay,” she thought. Gwen ran to the cargo door and yelled out “Dante!” before throwing the bottle and badge. Then, the cargo doors closed and flew off into the sky.

# Not knowing what it was, Ariel took cover as Dante reached for the bottle and badge. As soon as he caught them, Dante attached the badge to his belt and drank the formula. Immediately, he felt a rush of energy fill his body.

# “WOAH! That’s some powerful stuff!” Dante said with a smile on his face.

# “What was that?” Ariel said as she got up off the ground.

# “Nothing you need to worry about. Bye,” Dante said before transforming into Panthera. “See you later,” he said before running north.

# “What? Get back here!” Ariel said as she transformed into her Falconian form and took off after Dante.

# Zooming across the grasslands and hills, Dante ran as fast as he could. Soon, the badge started to flash. Stopping, Dante grabbed the badge and looked at the face. A small blinking light shown on the face. “Huh, wonder what’s that? Maybe that outpost the computer was talking about?” Dante said as he looked around.

# “Dante, we need to talk.” Gwen said.

# “What’s up?”

# “Your mother and father contacted me using my phone number. I tried my best to convince them you were safe. But they weren’t having it. They called my parents and set up a lunch meeting with us.”

# Dante touched his forehead while frowning. “I’m sorry, babe. I brought you into my family problems. I’m on my way. We’ll have to come up with a plan.”",1,1729634737.0,u_Professor_Little,0,1.0,False

","So this past Sunday, 10/20, while currently traveling in a different state, I decided to attend a local highly-reviewed Presbyterian church service. Service was awesome. Lead Pastor was great and inspiring…well-spoken and preached nothing but Bible scripture. It happened to be their baptism service for the children a nd that was just wonderful to see. All was going great as a one-time visitor until right after the service ended…

So a woman sitting in the row behind me, maybe about mid-50’sF, noticed me, 27M, clearly someone new sitting by myself. As service is dismissed she comes over to me, stares at me with these wide-open eyes, introduces herself and literally grabs my arm like we’re long-lost friends, to bring me over to the back where they have donuts and coffee after service. I’m like oh my, this lady is friend-ly! So we grab the coffee and she me aside to sit down and ask, “So, what brings you to _____ Church today?” I respond with, “Well, I’m just in the area visiting and…” 

Once she heard the word “visiting” her super-friendly “let’s be besties” aura did a complete 180! Her whole face turned upside down. It felt like something out of a comedy. We exchanged a bit more small talk about weather and what not before she monotonously goes, “Well, safe travels back home, take care...” Like what?? You were just grabbing my arm ready to whisk away into the sunset 30 seconds ago. It was obvious she was only acting friendly in order to try and get me more involved in church activities, and once she saw I was of no value in that way, I no longer mattered. I just feel like if you’re not going to be genuine about it, don’t do it at all. Unless…there’s an ulterior motive at play with churches who pull this kind of charade…could it be money?

I'm confused how customizations are interpreted by the staff. I read somewhere that a large coffee gets 6 syrup/ sugar and 6 cream by default.

So
Let's say I'm ordering a large iced caramel coffee , 3 cream, 2 caramel syrup, 3 Splenda whipped cream and caramel drizzle. 

Does that register as me asking for 9 cream and 8 syrup PLUS 3 Splenda ??? 

Or do you only put the amount mentioned in the customization? 

Also, if someone says no ice , do you fill the extra drink space with anything ? Would having ice or no ice alter the taste of the drink ?

1g9u8vk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g9u8vk,Honda EU3200i long term storage questions. ,"I live in Florida and recently bought a Honda EU3200i portable generator to keep my essentials going during the inevitable power outage we were going to have (and did have) with hurricane Milton. This thing was great and kept the fridge, coffee pot, TV and internet going during our 2 day power outage. Now that things are quiet I’m hoping to keep this thing in storage for a long time (fingers crossed the rest of the storm season is quiet). I’m reading the manual on how to store this thing properly, and I’m thinking I may not need it until next season or even longer. In the manual it has a table (see pic) and it says for a year or more of storage to fill it with fresh gas and stabilizer, but I would have thought it would make more sense to have all the gas out of it. Sure enough further down the manual it contradicts itself saying “IF your generator will be stored with gasoline…” and also for removal from storage it says “IF the fuel was drained during storage prep…”

So, what’s the best way to store this thing? Fill it with fresh gas and stabilizer, or empty the tank? 

Also, we didn’t quite run the generator 20 full hours… should I change the oil now (which it says to do in the first month or 20 hours usage), or leave it as is, store it and then change the oil when I pull it out for the next usage?

Sorry for any ignorance, I’ve never owned a generator before and just want this thing to last a long time. My neighbor bought a generator from Home Depot 4 years ago and left it in their garage in the box… long story short they could not get it going when we had the power outage… they had someone come look at it and they said it was basically trash because it sat so long without running. 

One final question… should I take this thing out once a year (even if I don’t need it) and run it for a bit? Don’t want what happened to my neighbor to happen to me. ",1,1729634129.0,Generator,0,1.0,False

1g9u5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g9u5yg/time_will_tell/,Time will tell…,"I will go ahead and tell you my experience. I (M24) and my ex girlfriend(F20) just broke up our 2 year relationship. Me and her used to work together, I thought she was too young for me at the time we met, and besides I was barely getting over a past relationship, at that time she was also in a relationship with someone else. We would text each other for work stuff, cool ideas etc. but nothing serious.

A few years later, we got to talk again. This time it was different. She was grown, looked more mature and sure of herself. At that time she had something I really like (she still does). We started going to the gym together, then coffee shop dates, movies, then I started eating lunch at her house and out of nowhere I had asked her to be my girlfriend. it was all great until she decided to move out of state for college… Now, I do not blame anything on her, I fully supported her decision, and I love her enough to try long distance… We started doing LD, and it was good, constant calls between classes, before sleeping, in the morning etc. Until something in me changed, i didn’t have the energy to continue… I knew something was wrong and I was immediately transparent with her. Still, we waited until we met in person to talk about it. 

We broke up, I made her the promise to fix myself and be ready for her (if she was still available) and we ended contact… It wasn’t hard for me at first but 4-5 months after I really started missing her. She was in town, and we talked, and we spoke about our feelings and we began dating again. Ngl, while single I did try to date other girls, but none of them had that spark that I saw in her.

Moving forward a few months to now that I had graduated college, I decided to look for job opportunities in her college city. And initially she loved the idea, she would tell me “why would you stay in that town if you feel like you don’t belong” or “you’re wasting your potential there come here!” I wasn’t very convinced at first but thought to myself. what is better than to live in the same city and grow a great career in the same town as my girl.

I know this is long… but I’ll be done soon. Last week i came back from the city she’s studying at, I had a few interviews which went great. But upon arrival to my hometown, she called. “I don’t think I have the energy to be in a relationship, I feel like we are very different” and that was it. She broke up with me.

It has been 3 days since. In my mind I think this might be a test life throws at you like last time, when we eventually got back. But i don’t want to depend on that feeling. I don’t want to throw hate or anything. I fully respect her decision in this matter although it hurts a lot. We had many plans for the end of the year that won’t happen anymore… I do feel sad… I do feel like I lost a family member. 

anyways, only time will tell… We either get back together… or we move on and grow from this.

1g9tx38,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9tx38/midnight_confessions/,Midnight confessions,"As a late-night radio host, I was no stranger to bizarre calls. My show, “Midnight Confessions,” attracted all sorts of listeners, from lonely souls seeking companionship to the truly disturbed. But one particular night, I received a call that would haunt me forever.

It started like any other evening. I was in the studio, sipping lukewarm coffee and chatting with a caller about their ghostly encounters when the phone lines lit up. The caller ID displayed a number I didn’t recognize. I hesitated, feeling an inexplicable chill run down my spine, but then I answered.

“Welcome to Midnight Confessions! You’re on the air. What’s your confession?”

There was silence on the other end, a heavy pause that felt too long. Then a low, gravelly voice finally broke through. “I’ve done terrible things.”

I felt a rush of adrenaline, intrigued yet uneasy. “What do you mean? You can share with us; this is a safe space.”

He chuckled softly, but it wasn’t a laugh of amusement. “Safe? That’s cute. You have no idea what I’ve done.”

My heart raced as he spoke. He described in chilling detail the lives he’d taken, the thrill of the hunt, the way their fear electrified him. I was gripped by horror, my mind racing as I realized I was speaking to a killer.

“Do you want to know how it feels?” he asked, his voice low and almost hypnotic. “To have someone completely at your mercy? It’s a rush.”

I tried to keep my composure. “Why are you telling me this? Why now?”

“Because, my dear host,” he replied, “you’re the only one who’s listened.”

I glanced at the clock; it was past midnight, the hour when the shadows seemed to grow long. “What do you mean? Surely you’ve told someone before?”

“Every time I call, they hang up. You’re different. You engage.”

I felt a shiver race down my spine. “Where are you calling from?”

“Does it matter?” he said, his tone dripping with amusement. “What matters is what comes next.”

“What comes next?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Another confession,” he said. “But this time, it’s personal.”

Just then, the studio lights flickered. I looked around, suddenly aware of how alone I was in that dimly lit room. “What do you mean by personal?”

“Do you have a picture of yourself? I’d love to see what my host looks like.”

My stomach dropped. “Why would you want that?”

“Because I’m coming for you,” he said, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. “And I want to know what I’m going to take.”

Panic surged through me. “You’re just a voice on the phone. You can’t do anything!”

“Oh, but I can,” he said with a sickening calm. “And I will. You’ll hear me before you see me.”

I glanced at the studio door, half-expecting it to swing open. “Stay away from me! I’m calling the police!”

“Go ahead,” he taunted. “But they won’t get here in time. You’ll see.”

With that, the line went dead. I sat in stunned silence, my mind racing. I quickly dialed the police, my hands trembling. I told them everything, my heart pounding in my chest as I waited for them to arrive.

Fifteen minutes later, the police showed up. They searched the studio and surrounding area but found nothing. No signs of anyone lurking, no clues left behind.

“Maybe it was a prank,” one officer suggested, though his tone lacked conviction.

I shook my head. “No, this felt real. He knew things.”

As I started to gather my things, I noticed my phone had a new message. I opened it, only to find a photo attached. My blood ran cold.

It was a picture of me, taken from outside the studio, the dark silhouette of a figure barely visible in the background.

The message read: “I’m closer than you think.”

I don’t do late-night radio anymore. They say you should face your fears, but some things are better left in the dark.

1g9tw95,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g9tw95/5_year_relationship_advice_needed/,5 year relationship - advice needed,"I'm gonna try to make it as short possible, I've been with this guy for 5 years now, obviously at first everything was great & wonderful, we came through some hardship financially, and the abuse started 8 months in, from being dragged across driveways, thrown outside to be left in the cold at -35 practically naked, and it went on as the years went by. Of course we had some great memories throughout the years, it wasn't hell every minute of every day, but it is when he wants it too be. Whether it's answering him in the wrong tone, not having his laundry done, having a bit of a messy house after working 40hours+. 
I know. I should leave. 
A close relative of mine was kind enough to rent a home to me close by from work, but the issue is I live in a small town, and the word got out to him. And we're still living together. After gathering up the courage for years, I finally had a getaway plan, but now he knows about the house for rent. Obviously telling the god honest thruth to him is not my intentions, I've already dealth with 3 concussions over the years that he gave me leaving me hospitalized for weeks. 
Just a glimpse of my reality ;
Every morning I wake up to get a coffee for him in town, one of those I got up to set the alarm off,  and once again on his phone were messages clear as day that were not to me., adding women on facebook , sending money to 'help them', to having conversations with them and deleting everything. He probably didn't realise the girls would answer back throughout the night, so I brought it up, and obviously he got mad that I was frustrated for something 'irrelevant' as he would call it because it's just social media.. just a few moments after I realised he was in my face screaming, he hit me twice in the face and whipped a coffee all over me.. this was last week

So right now, my heart feels like it's going to explode out of my chest, I've thought of moving outside the province so I could have a new life, a new beginning. Of course it""s wishful thinking, financially I wouldn't be able too. 
Which gets me to my point again, it was my way out for now, finally.. until he would've calmed down over it hopefully and move on, but now I'm terrified to death cuz I know he's just going to show up and leave his mark. He made it clear more than once, if I ever left, cheated or wasted his time, he'd make sure the last thing I'd feel would be from drowning in my own blood. Let alone giving me pain countless times & letting me live in fear over the years.

I tried leaving once before, and it was more of a mistake than anything. I called the cops to get protection, little did I know he had called them too. Because I left with the dog, with no food and he was in 'distress' from the situation they wanted to put him at SPCA, and the motherfuckers had the audacity to try and pin a DUI on me, while he was lying about the fact that I had smoked marijuana. Point being, my trust in our system is fucking way down the drain. I just had my hopes up thinking I was out finally but it just seems like it's never the right time

I could go on with stories of the shit I went through which is useless; I just don't know what to do anymore right now

Just injected my second 2.5mg dose, and week 1 was a breeze! Absolutely stunned at the positive side effects!

I've been lucky and had zero negative side effects, just (TMI) pooping a whole lot less, like every 2 or 3 days instead of daily or twice daily. Currently having a couple oaty hobnobs with my morning coffee to help that along and drink at least 2ltr of water each day (see typical meal plan below). Oh and Ive had a bruise on my belly since the first injection.

I am absolutely blown away how this medication has just flipped the switches off in my head. Food noise and cravings evaporated overnight! I even started my period on day 1 (I injected at 8:30PM the night before), and had zero cravings. In fact, two days in I remembered I had left over chocolate in a drawer from the day before I injected, a slab of hazelnut dairy milk with 9 squares left.

Now hear this...

I broke off 3 squares and enjoyed them with my afternoon decaf and PUT THE REST BACK IN THE DRAWER. WHAT IN THE HELL!? Who am I!? I have NEVER been able to put sweeties and biccies away for later. NEVER.

I literally finished the chocolate tonight, having eaten another 3 sometime this week and the last 3 squares tonight and now that its finished I won't be buying anymore chocolate, I just dont even think about it!

Then I had a passing thought about buying a big bag of crisps like I usually would and almost immediately forgot the thought! In fact the idea of eating a large bag of crisps didn't even appeal to me. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY!?

I'm also not really hungry much of the time which is new. Is this how normal people are? They feel a bit hungry, have something to eat and then get on with their day?? Is this what it's like to eat normally and not be constantly thinking about food and then overeating it when you do? MADNESS. 😆

I have also started weight training at the gym as I am 45 and have entered perimenopause. Really enjoying the challenge of lifting weight and getting strong.

But this lack of hunger is making it hard to hit my protein goals. I didn't want to have to get protein powder but it's the best thing when you can't face a meal.

My current meal plan is around 1300 calories/day and looks like this:

\- Coffee with 100ml oat milk and a stevia sweetener + 2x oaty hobnobs.

\- 2x large eggs scrambled with a tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese + either half an avocado or about 50g of thick cut honey roast ham pieces (sometimes on thin slice of focaccia)

\- Half a cup of Greek yoghurt + half a cup of raspberries + half a tablespoon each of chia seeds and crushed walnuts + sugar free syrup

\- 50g Whey protein + collagen peptides + various liquid supplements like milk thistle and zinc.

\- 200g rump steak + half a cup each of quinoa, sliced cherry tomatoes and rocket + a tablespoon garlic butter, OR, 200g air fried chicken breast with a cup of broccoli and half an avocado.

I will have a banana or an apple with cashew butter here and there and sometimes a herbal tea with a teaspoon of honey, but honestly I've never had to remind myself to eat and I have ADHD which usually makes you forget!

At this rate I don't see the need to increase my dose. I am happy that 2.5mg is helping me stick to a healthy eating plan. I just need to try to eat more since I am weight training now 3-4x/week.",3,1729632843.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

**December 17, 2024**

**Eldralore Academy**



Henry shut the door behind him, turning to Ryan. “Any alerts?”



Ryan scrolled through his tablet, then finally shook his head. “Nah,” came the relief-inducing response.



Henry set his Holding Bag down and plopped his ass on the couch. The shit they encountered in the forest was concerning enough. Having to deal with intruders on top of that? Thank goodness they’d been left alone for the time being. “Alright,” he sighed. “Safe enough to debrief, I guess. So, any takers?”



Ron cleared his throat, sounding as exasperated as Henry expected. “The Vorikhas. The way they avoided the hobs. The way Valtor clapped ‘em so easily when it woulda taken us TOWs. The way the Vorikhas were there in the first place. Shit, where to even start?”



Henry let out a small chuckle. It certainly was a lot to cover. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “Guess we can start with Vorikhas in the forest.”



“Vorikhas in the forest, huh?” Ryan didn’t rush his answer, but he didn’t dwell either, like he’d been mulling it over since they left the forest. His tone had that matter-of-fact certainty that came with years of hunting – man and beast alike. “Mountain critters like them ain’t got no business wanderin’ this far down. If they’re movin’ down, somethin’s pushin’ ‘em. Could be hunger. Could be somethin’ bigger.”



Isaac frowned. “Like… the Ovinne Mountain Campaign driving them out of their natural habitat?”



“Perhaps,” Dr. Anderson said, voice tapering off, as if something didn’t quite add up. “But that doesn’t explain why the Vorikhas passed over the hobgoblins. They prey on them, don’t they? It’s certainly atypical. I suppose it could be a number of factors, such as illness or –”



“Or someone’s fuckin’ with ‘em,” Ron finished bluntly.



“Mhmm. Shit ain’t right,” Ryan agreed. 



As far as Henry was aware, there was only one sort of circumstance where monsters would simply ignore their instincts – monster manipulation. “Reminds me of Hardale. Similar control, but different scale. Back then it was a Tier 7 threat – a bunch of goblins, fenwyrms, and treants; nothing too crazy. Now it’s Vorikhas? Just twelve miles from Armstrong, too.”



“Twelve miles,” Isaac muttered, shaking his head. “That’s practically in our backyard.”



A bit too close for comfort. Henry needed to phone this in – contact Armstrong.



“Blue One, this is Alpha Actual, over.”



The response came immediately, though masked by a crunching sound – chips, if Henry had to guess. “Alpha Actual, this is Blue One. Send traffic, over.”



Henry took a breath, then relayed the situation. “Blue one, Alpha Actual. We just confirmed presence of multiple Tier 8 hostiles – Vorikhas – approximately 12 miles northeast of Armstrong base in Eldralore Woods. Professor ad Stron eliminated two of them. We’re currently back in Hogwarts. Hostiles exhibiting behavior consistent with magical control, with a potential Tier 9 threat in the AO. Weather is clear, though foliage may impact visibility in the forest. Request immediate UAV for ISR over Eldralore Woods. How copy? Over.”



“Alpha Actual, Blue One. Solid copy on SITREP. Stand by for instructions, over.”



A brief pause, then the radio cut back in. “Alpha Actual, Blue One. We’re tasking a Reaper to Eldralore Woods. ETA 30 minutes to AO. Maintain current position and await further instructions. Acknowledge, over.”



“Blue One, Alpha Actual. Wilco. Standing by for further instructions. Out.”



Henry turned back to his team. 30 minutes to soak in the questions that still irked them. “Alright, we’ve got a Reaper checking it out. Hopefully, we’ll find something connecting Valtor to it.”



Isaac raised an eyebrow. “What, you still think he’s involved?”



*Involved?* It was a biased assumption, but Henry stood by it. Valtor had yet to slip up, maintaining his cover as a professor well – almost as if he truly were a professor, down to the snarky side comments and impactful lessons. He couldn’t deny that the professor had even been a significant help – even if indirectly – in teaching insights necessary for their Tier 7 test. Yet despite all they had learned in the forest earlier, and despite the crushing lack of evidence against Valtor, Henry couldn’t shake the pit in his stomach.



“I… don’t know,” Henry admitted. “Yeah, it doesn’t make sense, but I still feel like there’s something up with him. Shit, I mean, the timing? And how he handled those Vorikhas…”



“Like it was nothing,” Ron said. “Ain’t gon’ lie, I’ve never seen anyone take down Tier 8 monsters so easily. And that’s coming from the guy who blew up a Minotaur Chieftain.”



“Hell, maybe the sumbitch is just that good. He’s supposed to be some kinda high-speed combat instructor or some shit, ain’t he? But yeah, I feel ya. What fuckin' wizard's out here slingin' blades like a damn ninja?”



“Alright, let’s entertain the idea,” Dr. Anderson said, deciding to take on the role of devil’s advocate. “If Valtor’s pulling the strings, what’s his angle?”



“Hmm… Maybe to distract us?” Henry mused. “Could be something bigger going on, bigger than the monsters. And his cover as a combat professor is perfect – gives him free reign over the forest without raising any flags.”



“Yeah, but then why reveal the Vorikhas?” Isaac countered. “If he’d never shown the Vorikhas ignoring the hobgoblins, then we would’ve never gotten suspicious.”



Ron shrugged. “Or maybe that’s intentional, and he’s tryna get us to investigate. Bite off more than we can chew, prolly get bitten and chewed in the process.”



“All fair points, but there’s not enough evidence,” Dr. Anderson said. “Far too much deniability. We don’t even know if Valtor’s tied to the Vorikhas at all, or whether he’s working solo or with someone else. Why, we’ve no way of knowing if he’s behind any of this.”



“What about Lyrus?” Isaac asked. “Shouldn’t we hit him up?”



Ryan let out a derisive snort. “Shit, and tell him what exactly? Ay Dean, we reckon your new combat instructor’s a Nobian spook or some puppet master ‘cause, well, he ain’t suckin’ at his job? Hell, might as well ask for a one-way ticket outta here while we’re at it.”



Henry couldn’t disagree with Ryan. Even if Lyrus was inclined to believe them, the Academy still had rules in place. “Yeah, we gotta be careful about confirmation bias. We’ll find out soon enough, anyway. Let’s regroup in twenty.”



Henry lifted himself from the couch. The team already started to disperse, everyone attending to their own needs after a tense day. He headed to the bathroom, answering nature’s call while considering the Valtor situation. On his way back, he detoured to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of pinkish liquid from the fridge. The scent of berries provided a welcome distraction from the clusterfuck at hand.



Ron and Isaac were already sprawled on the couch, sharing a bag of local jerky. Ryan emerged from his room, freshly showered, while Dr. Anderson read through the study guide they’d found in the library earlier. 



Of course, the extra time to think turned out to be as useful as Henry had expected. Gravitating back together, the notes and theories they compared still amounted to about as much solid evidence as a flat-earther’s presentation at a NASA conference. 



The radio then crackled, “Alpha Actual, this is Blue One. Do you copy? Over.”



Finally.  “Blue one, Alpha Actual. Solid copy, over.”



“Alpha Actual, Reaper is currently inbound to the AO over Eldralore Woods. ETA two mikes. Prepare to receive ISR feed, over.”



Henry tapped the spacebar on his Toughbook, rousing the ATAK from its electronic slumber. Up came Eldralore in all its topographical glory. Green and brown contours emerged, a deceptively serene representation of terrain Henry knew to be anything but. “Copy, Blue One. Standing by to receive feed, over.”



“Alpha Actual, feed’s live. Transmitting now. Confirm receipt, over.”



The map of Eldralore was replaced by video from the Reaper’s optics complete with panels depicting thermal signatures and electromagnetic readings – poetry in pixels, if one’s taste ran to the militaristic. “Blue One, Alpha Actual. Feed received. Over.”



“Roger that. I’ll connect you to Captain Sinclair for briefing. Stand by, over.”



Once Sinclair picked up the radio, she wasted no time on pleasantries outside of their usual protocol. “Forest is showing elevated activity. I’m seeing readings exceeding eleven thousand milligauss in multiple sectors. Visual confirmation of multiple Tier 8 entities, including at least four Vorikhas. Hostile movements appear coordinated. Over.”



Great. ‘Coordinated’ was one of the words Henry least wanted to hear. “Copy all, Blue Actual. We see the same on our end. Any indications of external control or command elements? A rune system, maybe? Over.”



She responded, “Negative on visual identification of control elements at this time. However, patterns *are* consistent with manipulation – what we’ve seen in Hardale. We’re still assessing the data. Over.”



Of course. Because a day without an arcane mystery was like coffee without caffeine – theoretically possible, but what was the point?



“Understood. Recommendations? Over.”



Captain Sinclair took a moment to respond this time, background chatter coming through in unintelligible bursts. “Alpha Actual, you’ll be maintaining your current position. You’re authorized to coordinate with Academy staff tomorrow to inform them of the potential threat. Leverage your local insights. Do not engage or enter Eldralore Woods without express orders. Over.”



It was too bad they didn’t have anything larger than an F-35 just yet. JDAMs were a pleasant addition to their arsenal, but couldn’t quite cover the area they needed. A nice MOAB - or even some good ol’ saturation bombing – would’ve done the trick nicely. Why couldn’t the Nobians have waited a couple more months before enacting their shenanigans? Henry sighed, “Wilco, Blue Actual. We’ll liaise with the Academy and monitor for any developments on our end. Over.”



“Additionally, gather any intel available regarding Professor Valtor ad Stron, alongside any unusual activities at the Academy that are potentially related. Transmit findings via secure channels. Over.”



That was already hard enough. Hopefully, they’d be able to get at least something done now that they had evidence of monster activity – probably not enough to convict Valtor, but maybe enough to get Dean Dickwad to listen. “Understood, Blue Actual. Over.”



“Alpha Actual, we’ll send updates tomorrow morning at 0700, before you meet with Academy staff. Blue Actual, out.”

**Armstrong Base**



“We’re really gonna offer airstrikes and armor, huh?”



General Harding glanced over at Ambassador Perry, dejection seeping out of his every pore. “Affirmative,” was all he offered.



The Ambassador crossed his arms. “So much for minimal interference.”



“Well, the Nobians shouldn’t have fucked around, then. Besides, it’s not like we have a Prime Directive,” General Harding said.



Perry’s silence was its own response. He simply sighed, watching the approaching Sonaran convoy.



Six carriages in total, flanked by mounted knights in… not-so-shiny armor. Well, that was a surprise. In contrast to the gleaming visage they boasted a few weeks ago, the armor now looked muddied – camouflaged, almost, as if trying to mimic what they’d seen and learned from their visits to Armstrong. 



The formation was standard high-level diplomatic stuff for this world, but seeing it against the backdrop of T-walls, HESCO barriers, and razor wire was still a jolt. Overkill for a twenty-mile ride? Maybe. But with the recent monster activity, he couldn't blame them for being prudent. He'd have done the same.



The lead carriage rolled to a stop, the dradaks’ flanks heaving from the journey. The escorting knights dismounted, establishing a protective cordon around the carriages in very much the same way the Secret Service would – except with swords and bows instead of guns. They kept a respectful distance from the base’s guards, keeping their weapons sheathed.



Once the perimeter was secure, a knight came out of the rear carriage. Unlike the others, he had the usual shimmering armor; ornamental, perhaps. Or maybe he didn’t want to risk ruining whatever enchantments it had. He must’ve been Captain Orlen.



Harding hadn’t met the man personally, but the sight triggered a sense of recognition, almost as if familiarity was an inevitability between men of their stature. Much like the Duke himself, Orlen probably wasn’t someone who could plan or execute a high-altitude airdrop, but the broader principles of warfare, of loyalty and dedication, remained the same. 



Duke Vancor ad Styne emerged last, guided by Orlen. The man’s gaze swept over the base – cataloging the changes since his last visit. He didn’t hide his shock at all, but it was hard to determine what he might’ve been impressed about. The new technology? The speed at which they’ve built up the base?



“Welcome back to Armstrong Base, Duke ad Styne,” Harding called out, stepping forward with a firm handshake.



“General Harding,” Vancor replied, his grip as unyielding as ever. “Your fortifications have swelled since last I set foot here. Most wise.”



“Can’t be too careful,” Harding said, “especially with the neighborhood being rough as it is.”



Vancor gave a nod. “Aye, the roads and forests are thick with vermin. But let them come; I have seen darker times, and bolder men brought low. We shall be prepared, ere the day is done.”



Harding glanced at the muddied armor of the knights. “I see you’ve also been updating your tactical wardrobe.”



Vancor smiled, as if he’d been waiting for Harding to notice. “Indeed. After watching your men, we found some merit in letting the earth itself lend us its cover.”



General Harding simply hummed in response. He’d have thought the Sonarans would be the quintessential medieval fantasy civilization, but between the various studies conducted by their anthropology department and what he learned just now, it seemed folly to think otherwise. These guys were adaptable, through and through. Respectable, but also dangerous. He could probably expect the same – or better – from the Nobians.



“Your Grace, good to see you again,” Ambassador Perry greeted the man. “Shall we proceed?”



They got through the formalities fairly quickly as they stepped away from the main entrance and began their brief journey to the main command center by the gateway. As regal as the Duke seemed, he was a warrior at heart – more at home in war rooms than at soirees; more appreciative of concision than of small talk.



Harding brought him up to speed on the incident in the forest as they walked. “We’ve managed to visually confirm at least 4 Tier 8 Vorikhas, alongside hundreds of hobgoblins, treants, fenwyrms, and rillifanes of various Tiers. The mana in the region – or at least, the way we’ve been detecting it so far – appears consistent with what we’ve seen in the Gatebuilder site Alpha Team and Kelmithus have explored recently.”



Vancor exhaled. His smile revealed a troubled mind – one that was simultaneously relieved and concerned. “So, this is the cause that spares me that tiresome dinner. Fate, it seems, has a curious sense of humor.” He chuckled. “Though, had I known it would bring a threat to rival the Sentinel Lindwyrm, I might have chosen the lesser torment. Tier 9, you say? We shall need more than a ceremony and gilded arms for this.”



If there was one thing Harding liked about the Duke, it would certainly be his levity, though that was hardly the only thing. “I’m afraid it’s no laughing matter, Your Grace. Though I assure you, we’ve moved well beyond ‘gilded arms.’ If our Apaches can handle a Sentinel Lindwyrm, I’m sure our jets and tanks’ll do a damn sight more than ceremony ever could.”



Vancor damn near started to grin, his eyes narrowing like he was trying to picture what Harding was describing, and then coming up empty. “A curious thing, these ‘jets’ and ‘tanks.’ Your Apaches proved formidable enough against the Sentinel Lindwyrm – a fear not easily achieved. If these new weapons possess such power, perhaps our foes will tremble long before they face our steel.”



The man’s enthusiasm was hard to miss, though he probably had no clue what a tank actually was. Vancor’s imagination probably didn’t have a framework for a jet screaming through the sky at Mach 2, either, but that wasn’t as important as the message itself. “If we’re lucky, they won’t get the chance to tremble. By the time they hear us, it’s already too late. From what your Archmage tells us though, we might be looking at something a bit more complex.” Harding led them up the stairs inside the command center, turning right. “Situation room’s this way. We’ll give you the full picture once we’re in there.”



To Harding’s mild surprise, Vancor didn’t bat an eye at the technological wonderland before him. Seen a computer, seen them all? After offering a nonchalant nod to Kelmithus, the Duke focused his attention on the various maps – those he could understand, despite the methodology of sourcing the intel itself. Screens became reports and maps, analysts became advisors, and the whole situation room from Vancor’s perspective probably appeared no different from a war room in a castle – albeit one with significantly better lighting and climate control.



“Impressive,” was the man’s only reaction, seeming already at home. “Now then, what is the situation?”



Captain Sinclair introduced herself before laying it all on the Sonarans. Since their communication with Alpha Team, they’d confirmed 7 Vorikhas in total. Though lacking visual confirmation, the numbers alone were enough to heavily imply the presence of a pack leader: a Tier 9 Vorikha Apex. Alongside the notable absence of infighting and territorial disputes among the various species, this strongly supported what they’d suspected all along – the second coming of the Hardale incident. This time, however, they wouldn’t be dealing with fodder easily handled by .50 cal.



“We’ve also identified five potential strike zones,” Sinclair said, gesturing to one of the screens. The map displayed glowing nodes around the Eldralore Woods, clustered like seismic activity markers on an earthquake map. “These locations show the highest concentration of magical interference, and we’ve been detecting consistent spikes in milligauss readings. Comparing it to what we’ve seen in Hardale, we think there’s a rune system at play, plus 4 other conduits. However… The data is imprecise. Each zone covers a radius of approximately half a mile to one full mile.”



Harding had figured as much. As useful as their MacGyvered tech was, its capabilities were limited – only impressive because nothing else could detect mana.



“So, while we’ve isolated five zones, we can’t pinpoint exactly which one contains the rune system. The conduits we’re picking up are likely feeding into the main rune system, but we can’t distinguish between them with the tools we have.”



Captain Orlen spoke up, “General, could we not make use of your flying machines to bombard the targets?”



Harding nodded to Kelmithus, who answered for him. “The zones are too vast, and the resources required to raze the forest entirely too great, to speak nothing of the ruin of our own lands. A preliminary bombardment, lacking precision, could well stir the beasts to assault us before we stand ready. We must proceed with care, lest we invite calamity upon ourselves.”



Vancor took a seat, steepling his fingers on the table. “I concur with the Archmage – haste may well court disaster. Should our enemies catch wind of our intent or we strike amiss, we risk provoking a full-scale assault upon Eldralore. Our fortifications stand ready, as ever, but time to strengthen them further would serve us well.”



Fortifications aside, the monsters were already gathering. The Vorikhas, the hobgoblins – who knew just how much worse the situation could get? Though they had mortar units and even an MLRS, strategic bombers were on hold until after New Year’s. Pushing troops into the forest was too big a risk; with the forest right in between Armstrong and Eldralore, neither he nor the Duke could spare men for an assault. 



The best play right now – perhaps the only play – was defense. “How long do you need?” Harding asked.



“Two days, at the very least,” Vancor replied. “Though if it were mine to choose, I would ask for two weeks. Should I deem our defenses sufficient, you may launch your preliminary bombardment to prevent their numbers from swelling.”



Harding rubbed his chin. 2 weeks was a lot of time – both for their own preparations and for the presumed Nobians behind the monster manipulation. 



“How fast could their numbers grow?” Harding asked.



Sinclair pulled up a chart on another screen, showing a curve reflecting the estimated growth rate of the monster population. “Well, we’re assuming the monsters are migrating in from other regions. On the bright side, we know their growth is logarithmic.”



Vancor leaned forward. In no surprise, he seemed to understand Sinclair’s words well; expected of a ruler of a fortress city at the edge of Sonaran civilization. “The forest’s limits are evident, but have they means of resupply from without? When you noted their gatherings, did you see the beasts feeding? If so, it follows that the Nobians have provisioned them to support a larger force.”



Sinclair nodded. “There are signs of that, yes. We’ve seen clusters near water sources, and it seems the Vorikhas are taking down game in the outer regions of the forest. Their current numbers seem manageable, which is, ironically, a good thing.”



“They likely won’t attack until they’re over capacity,” Harding deduced. He sighed. Just a single B-52 would’ve given them the perfect solution, but he had to make do with what he had. “Alright. We’ll keep monitoring the forest. In the meantime, we’ll prepare our forces. If the monsters advance, we’ll engage them outside your walls – thin their ranks – while your men handle what reaches Eldralore.”



Vancor nodded. He agreed with the plan, likely seeing it as the best option they had, but certainly didn’t enjoy it. “Then we abandon our search for the rune system.”



But did they need to? Harding raised an eyebrow at Sinclair.



She understood his unspoken thoughts as well as a telepath might. “Not necessarily. An opening is inevitable – either we get lucky over the next few days and find it and bomb it, or we deploy a strike team to search for the device when the enemy finally commits the bulk of their forces to an attack.”



“A contingency, then,” Valtor mused, leaning back in his chair.



Kelmithus cleared his throat, stepping up to provide a suggestion that was already on the tip of Harding’s tongue. “If we are to send a strike team, Alpha Team may be best suited for the task. I would accompany them, as would Lady Sindis.”



Vancor stood from his seat. “Very well. Then we have our strategy.”



Harding nodded, rising as well. “We’ll keep you updated on any developments. In the meantime, since we’re running ahead of schedule, let’s see if we can get you back to that dinner of yours.”



A deep chuckle escaped Vancor’s mouth, the weariness of the meeting evident in his tone. “Ah, if only such trivialities were the worst of it. By now, no doubt, the wine has turned and the conversation descended into banalities unworthy of note. I imagine my absence is hardly lamented.”



He stretched lightly, casting a glance toward the screens. “But you are right, General – perhaps I should indeed raise a glass. Though, I fear the drink I shall require for this campaign must be of a far stouter vintage than that which has been laid upon the table this evening. And perhaps your men, too, will need drinks, ere they’re sent unto their great quest.”

**December 18, 2024**

**Eldralore Academy**



Henry groaned, rubbing his eyes as he checked the time – a soul-crushing 0630 compared to what he’d enjoyed the past few days. Back to early mornings, it seemed. The brief taste of academic luxury had spoiled him faster than unpasteurized mystery milk left out under the light of Sola.



Right on cue, his Toughbook chimed, signaling an incoming video call. Henry accepted it, and Captain Sinclair’s face appeared on the screen.



“Alpha Team, this is Blue Actual. Everyone present?” Sinclair began, seemingly unbothered by these hours.



“Alpha Actual, acknowledging. We’re all here. Go ahead, Blue Actual.”



“Still counting sheep, I see. Maybe this’ll wake you up.” A new file popped up beside Sinclair’s face. Henry opened it, scrolling through the contents as Sinclair explained, “We have new updates on the monster party, plus yesterday’s meeting with Duke Vancor. Hate to break it to you, but intel suggests high probability of a Tier 9 Vorikha Apex in Eldralore Woods. Visual confirmation still pending, but with 7 Vorikhas runnin’ around, I recommend you treat it as a guarantee.”



Fuck, if *that* didn’t snap the grogginess right outta Henry. And everyone else too, if the wide-eyed stares around him were anything to go by. A Tier 9 Vorikha Apex? Fantastic. As if regular Vorikhas weren’t already enough of a pain in the ass – and they hadn’t even fought one yet! At least the Sentinel Lindwyrm offered Thunder 1-2 a big, fat target to aim at.



Henry could scarcely imagine what that’d be like – probably like fighting the Spiranid Queen, but ten times worse. Their best chance would be an engagement on open ground, assuming their MRAPs could move fast enough to kite a speeding monstrosity on crack.



Unfortunately, it didn’t end there. “We’re also looking at five potential zones where the rune system might be hiding – each a square mile on average. The Duke doesn’t have the forces to spare for an offensive, so we’re focusing on defense for now.” Sinclair proceeded to outline the strategy cooked up in yesterday’s meeting with Duke Vancor. It wasn’t exactly a defensive masterpiece, but it was the best they could manage with their current constraints and lack of heavier assets.



“Understood, Blue Actual. Any other uh… pertinent information?” Henry could already guess where this was heading.  



Sinclair smirked in a way that made Henry almost regret asking – not that it would’ve mattered. “Well, if you’re asking for good news, Alpha Actual, then that’s an affirmative. We’re evaluating options for a search and destroy mission targeting the rune system controlling these creatures. Your team is being considered for this operation, alongside Sir ad Helis and Lady ad Sindis.”



Chances were, the Tier 9 Vorikha would probably be guarding said rune system, not to mention the backup it could call from the surrounding monster-infested forest. It was no wonder Sinclair said to treat it as a guarantee. He didn’t even need psionics to sense the groans from his team. So much for their ‘relaxing’ academy stint.



Couldn’t they have given the job to Taldren? At the very least, Henry could hope that a JDAM would take the load off them. He sighed. “Solid copy, Blue Actual. What’s our timeline looking like?”



“Still in the planning stages,” Sinclair replied. “It’s just a contingency, if we do ever find an opening. For now, your orders are to brief Dean ad Caldwin on the situation. The Archmage has already apprised him of the situation via aethergraph, so the Dean should be expecting you. We’re sending the documents to your phones and tablets as well – show him the data we collected and make sure he understands our defensive strategy.”



“Roger that, Blue Actual.” Henry acknowledged, already bracing for what promised to be a fun conversation with the ever-so-welcoming Dean. “Alpha Actual, out.”



Henry turned to his team as the call ended. “Well then, Dean’s office opens at 0800. We’ve got a bit of time for a quick breakfast.”



They settled for something light – bread and jam with herb-enhanced scrambled eggs on the side. Not the best option, but satisfactory enough. 



As they made their way across campus, the morning air still carried a chill that made Henry wish he’d grabbed an extra layer. Freezing temperatures aside, the falling snow painted the campus as a sort of winter wonderland – pretty, serene, peaceful, juxtaposing. The grounds were quiet, most students probably still cocooned in their beds, blissfully unaware of the shitstorm brewing in the woods beyond the Academy walls.



They finally reached the administrative building and made their way to Lyrus’ office, the door already open. The Dean sat behind his desk, looking up as they approached. “Ah, Captain Donnager,” he greeted, his tone polite but noncommittal – the way people sound when they’ve had too much coffee but none of it strong enough. “I understand you have some… pressing matters to discuss?”



Henry stepped into the office, his team filing in behind him. “Good morning, Dean,” he nodded. You’ve received Kelmithus’ aethergraph message?”



“Yes, I have. The disturbances within the forest are already known to me; I find myself at a loss as to why your presence in this matter is either necessary or desired.”



Dean Dickhead, at it again. Did he really need to be so difficult? Henry bit back a retort; he couldn’t waste Kelmithus’ influence. “I’m here to brief you, at Kelmithus’ request.” Henry pulled out his tablet and laid it on the desk, starting with the aerial snapshots of the monster activity. 



Lyrus reclined in his chair, eyeing the device with a reluctance so thinly veiled that anyone could see it – though, of course, the Dean hadn’t even bothered to mask it. “Pray, Captain, what precisely is it that I am expected to discern from these… images? I’ve no need for redundancies.”



Fair enough. The images of monsters didn’t really add anything new to Lyrus’ understanding. Henry scrolled past them, landing at the EMF data they’d collected. “We believe that the monster activity is artificial in nature – monster manipulation magic, coordinated through a rune system. These zones here show mana levels aligning with Tier 9 magic, and a closer look at the monster activity shows various species – even aggressive, territorial ones – coexisting. Predators and prey feeding alongside one another, sharing shelter, hell, displaying a complete lack of aggression.”



Lyrus’ eyes narrowed as he grudgingly examined the evidence. Even *he* had to take them seriously. “This is… concerning,” he admitted, though his tone suggested he’d rather eat glass than agree with Henry. “Curious, Professor ad Stron had reported this as an anomaly yesterday, though one attributed to unusual migration.”



Now *that* was something of note. Of course, it was possible that the whole fiasco might seem to be ‘unusual migration’, but to someone like Valtor, who apparently had extensive knowledge about monster ecology and behavior? “With all due respect, Dean, this goes beyond a simple migration. The evidence points to deliberate monster manipulation on a large scale. The Duke is already fortifying the city’s defenses.”



Lyrus scoffed. “And I suppose you must have some brilliant recommendation, Captain?”



Henry accepted Lyrus’ challenge. “I think an investigation on Professor ad Stron is warranted. The discrepancy between his report and our findings is… significant.”



The Dean’s face clouded over. “Investigate one of my professors? That’s prepo–” He paused. Though an incredulous proposition, it looked like they were starting to win him over. “Hm…”



Henry had to capitalize, starting with what Sera had told him. “Isn’t it strange that the ad Stron lineage is hardly known?” He pressed. “A Tier 9 combat mage – who taught him? Where did he learn all of his skills from? That aside, how could a mage of his caliber not notice Tier 9 magic in the area?”



Lyrus sat in stony silence for a long moment. 



Henry pressed just a bit further, “We could also get Kelmtihus’ input. We’re sure he’d agree.”



The Dean finally spoke, each word seeming to cost him physical pain. “Very well. I will… consider your recommendation.”

1g9tppx,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonbeersnark/comments/1g9tppx/whats_next_for_potentially_single_madison/,What's next for (potentially) single Madison? ,"**1. Wolfiecindy** 

Historically, Madison has no female friends. She could've kept her reconciliation with Cindy private but she's trying to prove something, whether it's to herself or someone else I don't know. But knowing how she (strangely) never kept female friends around her but has now made up with a person who supposedly wronged her, I can't tell if her breakup with Nick is permanent this time. 

As our lovely fellow user u/naurrr123 said *less than a month ago*, ""when a historically offline couple starts posting pics of them together like this, it’s never a good sign"". 

**2. Clout chaser allegations** 

When Vine was at its peak, she was with Jack Gilnsky. When David dobrik was at his peak, she was hovering around him and his friends. So when TikTok blew up in 2020, she found Nick. Is that a coincidence? 

One of Jack G's ex friends Taylor caniff dragged Madison online during the relationship, saying *“Because this girl has literally gotten with Cameron – I don’t know if she’s gotten with Cameron. Dude, I don’t care. I do not care about people’s relationships. I’m just like you guys. So, she was with Cameron, and then she was with Hayes, and then she was with uh, hanging around with one of the other guys. And then Jack”* among other horrible misogynistic things. 

I think we can all agree that these grown ass boys had no business being around 15/16 year old Madison anyway and her parents had a duty of care towards her, so let's ignore the blatant misogyny. Jack's friends made it clear they saw her as a user though. 

**3. Stagnant career** 

Speaking of TikTok fame, people like Nessa Barrett and Addison rae are surprisingly getting good reviews on their releases. Does Madison look at them and compare herself? Since she's so close with the triplets, she must know a lot about 'TikTokers' who got famous in that era. But she's been in the industry for this long and has no real identity or distinct sound. 

People from LA also frequently mention that no one in the area likes Madison or wants to get close to her. We've seen how she lives - frequently going to coffee shops, restaurants etc. yet she has basically zero friends? She probably needs a change of scenery, because if teenagers who only moved to LA a few years ago are 'making it' what's stopping her exactly? She had the perfect formula and I just don't get it. I look at her IG stories of her in-house music room and think about the legendary musicians who had none of that. 

**Will she change?** 

In a perfect world she would go to therapy, take a social media break, cancel the photoshop subscription and go to university abroad or something. Even though I don't like her personally, as a young woman I feel sad thinking about how she has no identity outside of her appearance. When her beauty is no longer what it used to be, how will she cope? She needs to get ahead of the problem and become mentally healthy right now. No more lies, no more unnecessary surgery & fillers. 

**But** if we're being realistic she'll probably go back to her twitch stream era and do the absolute most now that she's officially single. The way *these* men in particular talk about her like she's some sex doll, some wh\*re (literally their words I'm sorry) is so damn sad because they see her as a brainless bimbo and she eats it up for validation. 



ANYWAY I see a lot of you girls on LAinfluencersnark, so enjoy the tea but also look after your own mental health. Remember to never compare yourself to these people who pay for filters, Facetune, and consider plastic surgery an investment! ",5,1729632740.0,madisonbeersnark,1,0.86,False

I’m Alejandro X. Solis, and I’m thrilled (and a little nervous) to announce the release of my debut novel, Astral Resilience: Captain Ezra’s Odyssey. It’s been a long journey, filled with countless late nights, lots of coffee, and endless imagining of new worlds. But it’s finally here!

What’s Astral Resilience About?

At its core, this is a story of resilience—both human and galactic. Captain Ezra Kallis, commander of the Starward Bound, is an explorer at heart, but his latest mission is unlike any he’s ever faced. He and his crew are tasked with investigating the uncharted Sector 3, but what begins as a simple exploration quickly turns into a race against time. Ancient relics known as the Iridiax Cores—with the power to reshape reality—are stirring, and their awakening could mean the galaxy’s salvation… or its complete destruction.

Standing in their way is Balthazar Blackthorn, a feared warlord, and his enigmatic ally, Nexarion Abyss, who seek to use the cores to control the galaxy. Ezra finds an unexpected ally in Princess Xalara of Lumaria, a warrior with her own reasons to join the fight. Together, they must navigate hostile space, confront powerful enemies, and face choices that will test their courage and loyalty.

Expect:

	•	Epic space battles with ruthless pirates like the Void Raiders.
	•	Alien worlds with rich ecosystems, like X-23, where strange bioluminescent forests conceal ancient secrets.
	•	Deep character bonds, especially between Ezra and Xalara, whose alliance becomes a driving force in their quest.
	•	Themes of sacrifice, hope, and the battle between light and darkness.

Why I Wrote This Book

Ever since I was a kid, my imagination has been my constant companion. I grew up loving anime, video games, and all things sci-fi, and I wanted to create a universe that felt as immersive as the worlds I spent hours exploring in games or dreaming about during long nights. Astral Resilience was born from that desire to build a story where the stakes are as high as the stars themselves, and where even in the darkest moments, hope can shine through.

This is my first novel, so it’s a huge leap into the unknown for me, but I’m excited to share it with all of you. If you’re a fan of space operas with complex characters, mysterious powers, and heart-pounding action, I think you’ll enjoy this journey.

Where Can You Find It?

Astral Resilience: Captain Ezra’s Odyssey is available now on Amazon as an ebook and paperback!. If you check it out, I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

Thank you so much for reading and for joining me on this adventure. Let’s explore the stars together. ✨",1,1729632344.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

Hi,

I (25F) and my boyfriend (23M) live together. We started our relationship in November 2022 but it was non monogamous. We still had other romantic interests we wanted to pursue. I had gotten out of a DV relationship two years prior and stayed single to work on myself. The last year of my singleness I started to date and have sex casually. After a month, we both decided to close the relationship and it has remained that way since. He moved in with me the following January after a traumatic event with my mother (whom I’m now no contact with) gradually. Before then, he always visited to hang out, help with moving furniture (if I asked) and to pick me up for dates. He was living with his childhood friend and was only one city away from me.

I am a survivor of CSA and SA. The last conversation with my mother was her facilitating the molestation I experienced at the hands of her previous boyfriend. This led to me going no contact. I had been raped by a childhood friend turned FWB in November 2020. I was then sexually assaulted by my then boyfriend (DV relationship) and got pregnant. I miscarried. I have vaginismus and went to PT to cope physically and therapy for mentally. I explained my trauma to my boyfriend as we got to know each other. He shared as well. I slept with him shortly after and it was going great. The aftercare was great and included recap sessions on how we both felt about the sex as we cleaned up and ate. On Thursday, we had sex. It was great but he did not finish due to leg fatigue. We did our recap and I explained that my vaginal discharge was a different texture. It had a different smell. I explained that my PH must be off. I examined any changes I made as far as diet and detergent but everything was the same. I chalked it up to the fact every sessions we’ve had ended with him finishing inside of me. I am on birth control and have an allergic reaction to most latex condom brands.

This past weekend, I went to visit his older sister and brother in law. I adore them both and have gotten close to them. It was great and I got to see him be the attentive younger brother he typically is with his younger sister.

We got home on Monday and had sex. It was going well and I explained I did not want to be a Twinkie. He agreed to coming on my bum as a landing point. While in doggy style, he laid on top of me ( I am 140 and he is 230 lbs). He said he was close and I reminded him of the different landing site. He agreed again and then started dirty talking in my ear. He ejaculated inside of me and announced it.

I started to freak out but felt unjustified in doing so since he’s done it before. I nervously joked that he did not follow directions. He chalked it up to being “in the zone” and forgetting.

He went to work right after cleaning me up and grabbing me food. I felt weird during this entire situation but stayed silent. He came home that day and flirted with me like normal. I served dinner and packed his lunch ( he’s a blue collar worker that does 12 hours shifts).

I went to sleep and woke up to him trying to make cinnamon rolls. He’s a baker in his spare time and had been planning this for three weeks. I drifted to sleep again and he woke me up to tell me that he is out of one of the ingredients needed to make the rolls. He decided to experiment with the dough he made instead but hated it. I said okay and went back to sleep.

I woke up and he explained that he had not gotten to the dishes he made yesterday but will organize it enough so I can make my morning coffee. He planned to wash them tonight. I said as long as I can do what is needed then it’s fine for now. He left and I went back to sleep. I work from home and two hours after he does.

I go to the kitchen and see the chaotic mess. All our glass bowls are caked with partly dry and wet dough. The counters had brown sugar and powdered on them. I was pissed. I use the restroom and noticed my vagina is more raw than normal after sex. I am itching and may have an infection (I am making an appointment for Friday to address this).

He texted him the following messages in screenshots attached. He seems remorseful but I am unsure. Should I break up with my boyfriend for not listening to my lack of consent this time? Is he truly remorseful and can we get past this? Am I crazy for feeling violated? Is it my past trauma that is clouding my view on this matter? Can we work past this?

So here are a few things that are not very bottom-friendly, at least not for me:
1. I need to eat breakfast and have my first wake-up coffee before the mid-morning coffee date – I promised myself never to starve myself for sex ever again
2. I almost always need to do a number 2 after my second coffee – regardless of whether it’s black, with cows milk or plant milk

I’m most certain we will have sex at his place afterwards but it’s not where I can douche.

For oral hygiene, I could pack a travel-size mouthwash with me and use at the cafe toilet. But for bottom hygiene, how can I make it almost “accident-free” as I won’t have a place to douche (I don’t think I want to do that at the cafe toilet with a squeezy bulb)? Do I have extra fibre the night before preferably before bed to make it easier to “empty the vault” in the morning?

Day 1 & 2 I felt so incredibly calm. Everything moved slower… what people were saying, what I was saying, and my thinking. I had a heightened heart rate which is a trigger for my anxiety so I took Propronolol to combat it. Day 3 I started the day feeling calm and focused, then around 2pm I started to feel super jittery and strange - like I had too much coffee...? Propronolol somewhat helped but not a ton. 

So I’m curious, does lack of water & substantial food intake cause more jitters & nervousness on Adderall? I wonder if that was the problem today.

I've been paying attention to how my stress manifests physically and am really fed up with sneezing and hightened allergy symptoms like itchy eyes too.
 
For years I'd I get up before 9 AM without fail I will sneeze violent bursts that makes me exhausted for the rest of the day. There is a joke in my family that I'm allergic to mornings, but it's really more serious. I think it comes from all the years I spent waking up at around 6:00 AM to go to middle and high school, which was a traumatic time for me. I can't seem to shake this stress response and was wondering if any of you all had experienced this?

I though it was allergies for a long time so I tried to reduce allergens in my home and too antihistamines at night to help. It does a little bit, but these bouts of sneezing seem to be more connected to stress than anything else because they can happen at any time, and aren't connected to the seasons. 

I desperetly want to be able to wake up at a normal hour and get on with my day, but none of the regular sleep advice or ADHD guides have helped at all for this. No amount of coffee, tumeric, hypo-allergenic sheets, air filters, yoga, breathing excersizes, consistency, or sunlight manages to make much of a difference.  
No matter what I do I sneeze in the morning before I even do anything and it's exhausting, annoying to my flatmates, and embarrising.

I guess I'm not looking or advice, but maybe some stories. Obviously the solution is reduce my stress, but that's way easier said than done.

Seeking input on our thinking. HHi $500k between two earners

My SO and i typical work office jobs in a VHCOL city. Our total annual income has been around $500k for about 4 years now. Some of this is year end bonus. After tax, we get about $20k deposited into our account. 

Our fixed monthly include $7500 rent for a 3 bedroom apartment (2 toddlers), $500 for a car lease, $5500 for a full time nanny. About $2k per month spent on kids activities and classes. Then $4k-$6k per month on credit card bills, i think about two thirds of this is food / lunch / coffee etc. On most months, we are barely breaking even. 

I am trying to find where we can save, and housing is first on my mind. Spending 38% of monthly post tax cash flow in rent sounds high to me, but given the vhcol location and our jobs requiring reasonable commute, we have been struggling to find another option that seems viable. 

One of our toddlers may go to preK soon so our childcare cost may come down, which is good. Any other thoughts or feedback for us?

Also, both of our retirement accounts sum up to $500k of balance currently. I feel like we are quite behind… perhaps this is because our HHI increased quite rapidly in recent years, while our early careers we were both earning much less.

As I mentioned, Spencer was my high school sweetheart. We went to colleges on opposite coasts and tried to do long distance. When I came home for Christmas break my sophomore year of college, Spencer broke down in tears the first time he saw me and confessed that he cheated on me with a girl from college. He said it only happened a few times, that he felt terrible about it, and that he only wants to be with me. I was devastated, and ended the relationship then and there.

We stayed friends over the years, and ended up getting back together when we both moved back to our hometown after college. I was able to forgive Spencer for  his mistake considering he was only 20 at the time, he told me the truth when we reunited, and he showed genuine remorse for what happened. It took me a few years, but I completely trust him now and know he’d never be unfaithful in our marriage. I think a large part of it was that he got into a top college (Ivy League) and was a star baseball player, and it all got to his head considering he was so young. To be honest, I’m over what happened in college, but Spencer still beats himself up for it because he believes cheating is one of the worst things you can do to someone. He always says that he'll never forgive himself for hurting me so badly and that he doesn’t understand how I could trust him after he did that. I’ve told him that he should leave it in the past and think about what a good husband and father he is now, but he still dwells on it every once in a while.

I actually love my MIL and feel close to her because I’ve known her for so many years. She’s a successful attorney in our city, and she not only encouraged me to apply to law school, but also has become my mentor in the field. She always wanted Spencer and I to be together and was upset when we broke up. She kept in touch after the breakup and always got coffee with me when I was home to talk about my course schedule, internship opportunities, and law school applications. Neither of my parents are professionals, so she was a huge resource and help to me at the time. She's been a great MIL to me and a wonderful grandmother to my children. 

Over the weekend, we went to my MIL's house for dinner and drinks. My MIL and I were both drinking quite a bit of wine, and she was telling me that one of her nieces is going through a difficult break up and is heart broken. My MIL was in a serious relationship before she met my FIL, and she said she was crushed when that ended. I said I know what that’s like, because when Spencer and I broke up in college, I was a total mess. I cried all the time, lost weight, and was thinking about it non-stop for about a year.

My MIL was shocked by this, and said she didn’t understand why I was heartbroken when I was the one who ended things with him. I explained that I didn’t want to end the relationship, but I felt like I didn’t have a choice at the time. This seemed to alarm her, and she asked what I meant. I said it the break up was over a decade ago and that we’ve worked through it, so it’s not worth rehashing. 

My MIL then asked if it was because Spencer cheated on me. I think my face gave it away, because she immediately started apologizing to me and saying she was so disappointed in him. I asked why her mind immediately went to cheating, and she said that around the time we broke up, a girl from his college sent her a long email saying that Spencer was a jerk and that he cheated on his girlfriend with her. Apparently, my MIL confronted Spencer about it, but he insisted that the girl was just bitter that he wouldn't go out with her and that he never cheated on me. 

My MIL asked if the girl was telling the truth, and I said yes. I explained to my MIL that Spencer was young at the time, that he told me right away, and that he feels badly about it to this day. I also said that we were apart and our brains weren’t fully developed, and I honestly don’t think it says anything about the man or husband he is today. I told my MIL that he’s kind to me and that I trust him fully, but she seemed very upset by this news.

My MIL said she tried to raise him to respect women and always told him that cheating was wrong. She also said she was upset because he lied to her about it. Apparently, he was devastated about the breakup, but always blamed it on the distance. I reminded my MIL that it was over a decade ago and that I’ve gotten past it, but she kept saying how upset and disappointed she is.

I told Spencer about the conversation with his mother and he was upset about it. He hates disappointing his mom, and wishes I had kept it to myself because it happened so long ago. I explained that she asked me to my face and that I didn’t feel comfortable lying,and he said  I could have tried harder to dodge the question. He has since changed his stance and said I was right to be honest and that it’s not fair of him to expect me to hide my feelings and never talk about it. To be honest, I kind of miss him being upset with me, because he’s been in a shame cycle for the last few days. He keeps saying he feels terribly for hurting me, that he doesn’t deserve me, and that he’s humiliated that his mom knows. They’re getting coffee later in the week and I have a feeling she’s going to give him an earful and make him feel even worse.

I didn’t mean to air out our dirty laundry but she asked me directly and I didn’t want to lie. Also, my face completely gave it away. AITAH? I feel like I messed up but would appreciate your thoughts and advice on how to move forward.",29,1729631499.0,AITAH,33,0.97,False

What do you think the best way for you personally to stay sober is? Like changes/replacements you made, new habits/rituals, new ways of thinking/perspective shifts, etc. 

I ask because my partner & I have been playing around with the idea of sober-ish or going without for longer stretches. Mainly for health & being the best for our child. We both drink farrrr less than we used to, so I wouldn't say we're over- doing it (maybe I'm denial?), like I have between 1-2 tallboy ipas (6.5abv), my partner will have 2 or 3, but it's just still a vice I wouldn't mind cutting out almost entirely. Far less expensive than our old $80 nightly bar tabs, but $30 almost every night still adds up & it's such a waste of money. 

The problem I'm having is what to replace the ""ritual"" with that still equates the same amount of reward. Knowing myself, I know I need that in order to be successful at this, and also having more structure in my night after putting babe to bed where the need to ""decompress"" starts, & something that I also could look forward to the next day (other than work). Like, when I was pregnant, I replaced the ritual with stretching, making a wind down routine with tea, & looked forward to my cup of coffee the next day. I'm planning on kind of doing that routine again, but, when I was pregnant those hormones & the reasons were different. I also just really didn't have any cravings because of all the bandwidth of being pregnant. 

Another problem is that my partner also wants to stop drinking, but he has different ideas how he wants to do it that don't include me & I really feel that might be setting us up for failure from the get-go because we drink *together* & I feel much more hopeful & motivated if he were to do the healthy alternative with me, instead of leaving me to my own devices & bad thoughts. I feel like we'd hold each other more accountable if we were replacing the ritual with something else together. I'd like to say I'm confident enough to not need him through this, but I do. Of course down the line, I'd love to gain that confidence, but right now I'm nowhere near that. So, I'm not sure who's approach is better here, and I'm not sure how to talk to him about this, he's been a bit defensive about it.

I feel basically like my old self again *except* my brain has rewired for the better where I don't feel the need to binge drink as much, & I can stop myself & go to bed to get up for work. This was a problem in the past. I'd either have to totally abstain if I knew I had to get up early, or if I even had 1 drink I knew I was fucked the next day cuz I'd keep going. Now that that's not really a problem anymore, I can enjoy 1 or 2 drinks, but that became my almost nightly ritual that I looked forward to after a long day. Put babe down, sit outside with my partner, talk about our day over a few drinks & smokes, & then once I was done with that, I'd have a snack, watch something on tv, go to bed. There's just something about that 4-6 hour span of time where everything is settled & that little nagging voice comes in, & I'm like, ugh, I want a few beers. I want that voice to go away completely. 

So I need to find something else to ""fill the void"" but it needs to be something I realllyyyy WANT to do. Stretching & tea are nice, but what I really want is a beer & a cigarette. Lol. 

Hopefully this all makes sense, I have a hard time explaining sometimes. Thank you in advance for your advice & insight. ",2,1729631351.0,stopdrinking,0,0.75,False
1g9t51b,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1g9t51b/all_some_feedback_for_the_developers_from_someone/,[ALL] Some Feedback for the Developers from Someone Who Loves DE (so far),"As an unapologetic Life is Strange fan and a total Chloe stan, here’s my review of the first two chapters of Double Exposure, so spoilers for everything released for all LiS games to date. Although, I haven’t delved into any leaks or any rumors, so none of that will feature into my analysis here. And I’m going to avoid conjecture about the central mystery (or mysteries) of the game.

In addition to contributing to current discussion, I also hope that this may be of use to the developers. I love this series, and as a former video game developer myself, I suspect that a lot of my critique comes from that perspective. I apologize if anything I mention here is contrarian to established community sentiment, but I assure you, these are my honest thoughts.

Obviously, since the entire game isn’t released yet, and specifically because mystery stories are so influenced by their resolutions, what comes later may greatly impact my overall impressions. Everything here is subject to change.

**TL;DR:** I loved the first two chapters. I’ve played through them three times now, which was not something I was planning on doing. The greatest highlights are Max, the facial and gesture animations, and the centering of a mystery. The worst lowlights are no Chloe, frequent issues related to audio, and emotionally-leading exposition. Biggest missed opportunity is Bae Pricefield, Bae Friends, and Bay Max are all the same Max.

I apologize for my aggressively long post here.

Let me start with the **good stuff**.

**Confident Max:** Regardless of your specific choices for the outcome of LiS1 (which you make at the beginning of DE), Max is a much more confident character than she was in LiS1.

The Max we’re presented with right from the start of DE is the confident Max that, regardless of whether she saved her Bae or the Bay, was the girl that was tied up by Jefferson, and still defeated him. Jefferson may not have that experience anymore, but Max sure as shit does. In the 10 years-ish between LiS1 and DE, Max has probably encountered a bunch of shit that’s all lead her to the moment we find her at when DE starts. Sure, she still experiences imposter syndrome, but now she still takes the shot and shares her art.

Max’s confidence isn’t “told” to us, which is great. It’s just there in all of her interactions. DE does a great job of constantly showing that this is a continuing struggle for her, too. Seeing the same old inner, contemplative, unsure of herself Max juxtaposed with the leveled-up life skills outer Max is undoubtedly my favorite part of DE so far. For example, Max still has a hard time talking to pretty girls, like Amanda at the start, but at least now she can power through it. And, when Max senses something is wrong shortly before Safi gets shot, and later when Reggie has a panic attack, Max takes charge both times without missing a beat.

The evolving Confident Max versus the Cautious Max theme is my favorite thing in Double Exposure so far. And a large part of why is specifically because the camera never points at it and shouts, “LOOK AT IT!” The game trusts that we can see it for ourselves.

**Maxisms:** I love, love, love that Max still talks and thinks like Max. These are just a couple that come mind.

* “Oofa doofa.” Is she cereal?
* “Affection, what was I thinking.”
* “For sale: Bowling shoes. Extremely worn.”
* “Always wondered what’s inside a bowling ball. Turns out, it’s just more bowling ball.”

I totally understand why so many people thought the slang usage in LiS1 was cringe, but I’m here for it. Just blast me in the face with as much overtly-earnest Maxness as possible, please.

**Facial Expressions and Gesture Animations:** They’ve really taken LiS to the next level here. I’m sure some will point out how great the facial expressions were in another game they think does it better, and yes, there are plenty of games out there that have really captured this magic well. But, LiS games have always struggled with this. Probably mostly because of budget, but also probably partially because of the original impressionistic art style and other confounding variables. Here, Double Exposure really works some magic. There are a slew of micro-expressions that really do a wonderful job of expressing a vast amount of the characters’ metallization. We love to see it. The body language gestures are also mostly great despite a few cringe ones on occasion. But the cringe ones seem more like character-specific “flair” rather than accidental, so I appreciate those, too. There’s a shot where Max pensively sits down after Lucas catches her taking a picture of his restraining order for Safi. It’s a blink and miss it moment, but stuff like that is done amazingly well. I also love when Max bites her bottom lip while drawing on Lucas’ standee. There are a ton of little moments like this in the game. Max’s eyes are consistently expressive, and their expressions almost always unique. There must be 50 unique Max eye animations in just the first two chapters.

Art Style: Basically any changes to the original game’s style were always going to result in massive fan backlash. But… I think Deck Nine really hit this out of the park. If you imagine four completely distinct forces all trying to pull away from each other like four Venn diagram circles which all hate each other – the original game’s art style, higher fidelity graphics, Max’s original character model, and aging Max up – then I think Deck Nine really hit the sweet spot where the smallest possible overlap existed for all four of those things. I know a lot of people weren’t able to recognize Max in the first gameplay trailer, but I did. And I think they did a wonderful job. Maybe a lot of people just have [prosopagnosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia)? Sure, she’s changed a bit. She certainly has a pointier chin now, but considering how hard this must have been, I think they absolutely nailed it.

**Voice Acting:** Dang. The voice acting is just phenom. All around. Hannah Telle is just killing it. She’s done a really good job of “aging up” Max’s voice, while also capturing an intrinsically shy woman who has also gained a shit ton of confidence. Talk about walking a tightrope. There are even times where she sounds much more like LiS1 Max, usually when Max is in moments of grief. As if she’s regressing because of the stress. Nice touch. But just all around so good. Not sure if that was Hannah’s choice or a director’s, but the entire collaboration has come together really well.

**Max’s Autistic Coding:** I think they doubled down on the theory that Max is autistic. Spawning from her Blackwell record [(you can see it poking out on the blue-ish piece of paper on the bottom left of this image where it reads, “Initial IEP”)](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/life-is-strange/images/d/db/Max_Academy_Record.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150615022159), many have conjectured that Max was intended to be on the spectrum. Some suspected ADHD, which may also be in that mix, but I’ve always favored the autism theory.

She frequently seeks out moments where she can chill out because she’s easily overstimulated. She experiences selective mutism (her lack of responding to text messages). She has a keen eye for detail. She has intense special interests (i.e. photography, horror films, blue-haired ladies). She even walks up stairs holding her arms up as if she doesn’t know what to do with them. There are a lot of examples. As an autistic person myself, I think Deck Nine has done a great job of factoring this into Max’s character (as Dontnod did before them) and expanding it without pointing at themselves and chanting “Look how cool we are because Max is autistic!” Also, aside from the supernatural powers, they didn’t give Max any “autism powers” of savantism. I absolutely never want to see Max solve a mystery because she can instantly count how many matches fell out of a matchbox or because she knew which way the wind blew on a specific date. The fact that Max really only experiences difficulties from her autism, but she herself becomes a stronger, more capable person from persevering over those difficulties is, for me, what makes her a truly magical character. The coolest parts of LiS1 were when Max saves Kate (sorry for those of you that didn’t), and when she backtalks Jefferson and/or manipulates him when she’s tied up. Neither time did she have access to her powers, and both show the quality of Max’s character and how she changes over the course of the story. This is what people mean when they say they want representation. They mean representation that’s done well. To quote Double Exposure Max again, we love to see it.

**Moses is Also Autistic:** I’m even more certain that Moses is also autistic. He works in the sciences. Is easily emotionally overstimulated. He stims. One of the best ways to depict autism, and any “group” of people for that matter, is to have more than one person from that group in a story so that you can see the differences between them. Max and Moses, both autistic, have some similarities, but many differences. It’s like a [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) but doesn’t have to be confined solely to female characters. I’m going to call this the “Max Test,” when any two people from the same non-majority group talk to each other about something other than the non-majority group.

**Max’s** [**Selective Mutism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_mutism)**:** I love that they turned the plot point from the original LiS, where Max didn’t contact Chloe for 5 years, into a character trait where Max just shuts down and can’t communicate with people, especially not digitally, whenever she senses difficult emotional contexts related to that person. In real life, my partner literally has this exact same issue.

**Safi’s Likeability:** I think they did a great job of making Safi likeable very quickly, without overdoing it. Even the numerous times that another character basically turns to the camera and says that Safi is great is usually only specifically highlighting something she’s done in the past, so it’s at least a bit indirect. And considering that she’s offed in about 90 minutes of playtime, making her likeable is no easy feat.

Also, strange observation; Was Safi based on Kathryn Hahn? Or maybe was her actress inspired by her? Just wondering, because she seems to have a lot of Hahnian mannerisms. Maybe just a coincidence.

**Likeable Characters:** This also has a bit of an addendum under the “bad” section, but I find that I like all the characters. Even the ones the game clearly doesn’t want me to like. And not “ironically,” either. I found all of the characters to be interesting and mostly enjoyable.

**Lucas:** So the voice acting, facial animations, and body gestures are universally good. Especially with Max, which makes sense. But, for some odd reason, I think that Lucas really shines in all these areas. His voice acting and micro-expressions are especially great.

**Options Aren’t Strictly a Binary Good/Bad:** The very first option in the game is when Safi asks you why you like taking photos of abandoned buildings. I assumed that like most choice games, all options were going to be either the “good guy” or the “bad guy” option. So it wasn’t until my “make everyone hate me” third playthrough that I decided to go with the option for this one that has the word “Useless” in it. And judging from the 15% of players that have chosen this (at the time of my last chapter 1 completion), I assume that most people thought that was the “bad Max” option as well. However, the dialog is really good, and has nothing to do with Max being a nihilistic ninny and saying something like, “I don’t know, it’s all just useless. Who cares.” Instead, she reflects on how special something can be, even when it doesn’t have a use anymore. Finishing with the line, “Useless doesn’t equal worthless.” There are certainly some “bad Max / good Max” dialog options in the game, but most of them really are just different perspectives. And honestly, it’s made the game an absolute pleasure to play again and choose all the different options. Love this approach.

**Setting:** I have really loved Caledon University so far. All of the areas are visually and thematically unified, but still each is unique. And I love its cozy charm. The only issue I have with it is that I wish I could go running through the snow and actually walk to the Turtle from campus.

**Chloe and Victoria CrossTalking Each Other:** Never did I ever imagine that an official game would actually feature Chlotoria Prace (hey, it was that or “Vicloe Chice”), but I’m here for it! If the two of them show up at some point in the game, I will literally explode. Please, please, PLEASE let this happen. But if Chloe hooks up with Victoria and Max isn’t invited, I’m going to be very displeased. Throuple or nothing.

And now just a couple of other quick mentions about little things I loved:

1. I highly recommend doing both a Bae and a Bay playthrough. Personally, I started with Bae because duh. But my third playthrough I chose to have sacrificed Chloe, and the way that something later in the game hit me was… fantastic. Sad, but awesome. For those planning to do two playthroughs, I’d recommend that order. Bae then Bay. At least so far.
2. The first transition when using your timeline-hopping ability was pretty cool.
3. The way that Max’s hair blows in the wind when she walks between realities is a lovely touch.
4. I’m not sure if this is a real thing, or just in my head, but I’ve noticed it twice now. When opening the origami flower on the bench, the music always seems to become discordant. If that’s a real music cue then that’s cool.
5. It is hilarious to me, and a little aggravating, that Max has so many unique dialog lines about the motion-activated Christmas tree ornament.
6. Did anyone else notice the bulldog statuette with the luchador mask on the table near the large window on the bottom floor in Max’s residence? Cute!

 

**The Bad**

**Not Enough Chloe:** Yes, like many others, I prefer my Chloe to the Max (you’re welcome for that). When I order meals, I always take them with a side of Chloe. And when I order Chloe, I always order her with a side of more Chloe. Now, I assume she’ll still pop up at some point in the game. And if she doesn’t – even if only as a set up for the next game – then I’m going to be furiously disappointed.

This may all be a ruse for introducing Chloe later as a big surprise, but I also get the feeling that someone in a meeting somewhere probably had the opinion that, “Still being with your high school sweetheart when you’re 28 isn’t romantic, it’s sad.” Having been a video game developer myself, this is the exact kind of shit that marketing people and consultants say to executives while all the creatives silently scream in their heads.

I don’t like that Pricefield has split. Nor the way the game has handled it so far. But, I’m cautiously optimistic that the game will make up for this later. Please do not let me down. If anyone knows of any leaks about this, I don’t want to know, thanks.

**Bae Max and Bay Max are Basically Identical**: Here is the biggest missed opportunity for me so far. As much as I love Confident Max, I think that Max basically being the same regardless of which final option you chose in the first game is a real missed opportunity. Just spit balling here: Maybe Bay Max would have been far more reticent to try out relationships. Even though Bae Max is likely still recovering from her breakup with Chloe (in fact, there should be a third option for “Were Just Friends” Bae Max), I suspect she’d be much more likely to consider new romantic interests than the woman who sacrificed the love of her life, no matter how long ago it was. Maybe Bae Max would be angrier? There could have been a lot of ways to go with this, but instead, Max is Max is Max.

**Emotionally-Leading Exposition:** Getting back to liking the characters… Perhaps my biggest irritation in the game is how frequently it tells you how you should think about the characters. Up-to-and-including having Max specifically tell you that someone is a jerk, or annoying, or should be avoided. In previous LiS entries, characters frequently mention how THEY feel about another character, like Chloe complaining about her step-douche, but the games generally leave how you feel about a character up to your decisions. If you decide to crap on Victoria, Max is more likely to make mention of not liking her. But if you give her a chance, Max is more likely to comment on Victoria’s positive qualities. DE doesn’t seem to have faith in its story enough that the player will come to the “correct” decision about certain characters. This is even more baffling when Vinh, a character you’re supposed to dislike and be suspicious of, is presented as a romance option. And then Dr. Gwen Hunter is presented as likeable, despite being a suspect. And also doing a ton of crazy shit, like offering a coworker weed directly before informing her that she’s possibly being fired for selling drugs to students (yes, I’m aware weed has been legal in Vermont since 2018). Dr. Hunter then lights a trash can on fire and THEN LEAVES IT ON FIRE! But perhaps the worst offender is Loretta Rice. The game immediately pushes you into hating her, despite the fact that if you make certain decisions, Loretta comes off more as an ally, and regardless of your decisions, she is helpful and caring to others. Also, she’s literally just trying to do what Max is doing. Blows my mind.

Even in writing, we get things like “Gwen seemed rightfully upset about getting forced out of her office,” and “… she (Safi) deserves to know if someone is filing charges against her.” Both of which, I totally don’t agree with. Being upset, and especially weirded out by your doppelgänger would be normal. Losing your shit on the security guard is not okay. And no, there’s no reason Safi needs to be told that someone else is filing a restraining order against her. If anyone ever wants to file a restraining order against someone, just let them.

Even for decision events like “Save the footage vs. stand with Gwen” is weird. I’d have gone with “Save the footage vs. Let the evidence burn.” But no, the game insists on speaking down to the player to say, “Gwen is morally correct, and you have to decide which part of the ‘narrative’ you’re on here.” Just let Gwen be Gwen like how Max and Moses are Max and Moses instead of surrogates for all autistic people everywhere.

**Release Scheme:** Everyone is complaining about charging extra money for two week early access to the first two chapters, and I get it. That aside, I still think it would have been better to release the episodes, like at the fastest, one per week. In fact, I’d have probably released one chapter scene once a day, Sunday through Thursday, for five weeks. I’m sure they look at numbers that tell them not to do staggered releasing because of money, but I honestly suspect it’d make them more money in the long term to get more people into the conversations. When LiS1 came out, the months between episodes were fantastic for community theory crafting. Maybe they’re just scared now that someone will “figure it out” before everything can get released. I don’t care if Garglenuts6969 figures it all out before the big reveal. As long as the reveal makes sense, and as long as I care about the characters, then I care a lot more about being able to participate with others in loving a story than I do about getting mystery boxed.

**Timed Responses:** I think there are only two, maybe three, of these in the entire first two chapters, and all of them are within the first 30 minutes of gameplay. By the time any more come up, I’ll probably have forgotten they’re a thing. Also, playing on PlayStation, the R1 button displays during timed responses. I tried pushing it once to see what it does, and it like… backed me out to the subtitles for what triggered the timed response, but then I couldn’t do anything and it forced me to run out of time. I uh… I have no idea what the R1 is supposed to do here.

**Changed Interests?:** I’m not even sure if this is a thing, but I thought Max liked anime, along with most other “nerdy” stuff back in LiS1? In DE, she basically just shits on anime. Am I taking crazy pills here? Was this always a thing? Or did someone working at Deck Nine decide that anime was “only for incels” or something and make this retcon? Also, not that Warren didn’t provide Max with plenty of “gore” films, but I don’t remember her being a “gorehound” before. Nothing wrong with developing new interests, but I would have assumed we’d have gotten backstory as to why if these things had changed. I guess Warren’s Cannibal Holocaust really made an impression on Max?

**It’s Clear They Want Max to Be Gay Canonically:** No shade on the gays here, and in my head canon Max is definitely chloesexual (as all attractive people are), but it is strange to me that DE is clearly pressuring the player into playing Max as gay, but doesn’t fully commit to it. Max wears [Doc Martens](https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/pride/history) with every outfit. The game’s second scene literally launches you into trying to court Amanda whom you don’t know at all. It’s weird what happens if you decide not to romance Amanda, too. She and Max still share goofy smiles, and they’re framed with long looks at each other. I’d rather they just come out and say, “Max is gay and she can only do gay shit from now on” rather than this weird hybrid where it’s like, “We’re not saying Max is gay, YOU’RE the one saying she’s not. But I guess you can romance a dude if you want. Except we’ll only give you one option and he’s a total d-bag and he was your dead friend’s ex.” So weird. It’s like they’re saying, “Oh, it’s player’s choice. WINK!” And I’m the crazy one because I have to say, “Did you just *say*, ‘Wink?’”

**Zero Safi 2.0 Time:** In Chapter 2, you find your dead friend alive again, and the game basically allows you zero time with her. Chapter 1 ends with you leaping through reality and hugging her. Chapter 2 starts with you at a table with her and her mom, but you have to go to the bathroom because of your nosebleed. When you return, Safi shows you a picture of her car, and that’s the last you see of her in Chapter 2!!! I’d be like, “Sit your ass down. I just traveled here from an alternate timeline where you were murdered. You better start spilling the beans until Frank complains!” I would not immediately run off without talking to her.

**Conjoined Outfits:** I like that there are outfit choices, but I really dislike that the indoor and outdoor outfits are conjoined, and that they’re also merged with Max’s hair color. Let me mix and match! Trust that I will like whichever poor choices I make more than whichever good selections you allow me to have.

**Decentralized Music:** Is it just me, or is the music downplayed in this game? Maybe it was a cost cutting decision, or maybe it’s because of how popular these games are to stream and people have had issues with music in their streams? Whatever the reason, I feel like the music so far has played a much smaller role than in previous LiS games. Even less than in True Colors. It’s a shame, because I like all the music so far, and I’ve always loved LiS soundtracks.

**CrossTalk Thumbnail Images:** This is one of those small quality of life things. The only thumbnails with images of people are ones for the handful of characters whom you speak with in the game. It would have been nice to have had thumbnails for everyone. It’s even weirder when I recall that at least one person has her image in Moses’ Christmas card, but she only has her initials in the app. Put her image in there!

**End of Episode Segments:** I really would have liked the end of episodes to have had the musical clip segments and the next episode previews like the original LiS1. They were very atmospheric and iconic.

**Photo Blandness:** Maybe it was just the art style, but the first LiS really had some cool “pictures.” Especially Max’s “Unselfie.” Like, legitimately a cool concept. And there are plenty of really cool art ideas in DE, just none of them are Max’s photos. Gwen’s book title and opening line are great. Cover art for the “Girl’s with Sharp Edges” book that Gwen has Max steal is awesome. But all of Max’s photos are… meh. From the ones you take, to the ones on her bedroom wall, to the bowling alley, to the ones on display in the FAB. Just pretty meh. I think the coolest option was the smoke face in the bowling alley or maybe the Jonah whale. Max is supposed to be an amazing photographer. I’d like to see more amazing pictures. Even just one! If you went Bae, where are the photos of the survivors of the Arcadia Bay disaster? If you went Bay, where is the photo memorial to Chloe? I just saw that Deck Nine ran some kind of photo contest where fans sent in real photos they’d taken. Like ALL OF THEM were great. Just ask those people if you can shove them in the game and credit them in the credits. Wham bam, done.

**Faux Professionalism:** At least twice, the game specifically calls out that the DE universe(s) have the same concept of workplace and academic professionalism that the real United States has. But everyone ignores the shit out of it. Gwen has a meltdown over her boss having CCTV video which shows her selling drugs to a student, and then dresses down the security guard who’s trying to escort her off the premises by making a bad faith moral comparison between him doing his job and literal Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials. Then she smokes weed on campus, offers it to the artist-in-residence, then sets fire to a trashcan that she leaves burning (yes, I know it’s surrounded by snow, that’s not the point)! And the game frames her as “cool.” Vinh is drinking on the job while literally staring at his boss’ door while claiming he doesn’t want to be caught. Moses does everything he can to interfere with a police investigation into his dead friend. And the way that Max can treat Loretta, a student, and Lucas, a member of the faculty, is insane. Like actually insane. I think all of these could have had just little tweaks to make them not seem to flagrantly unprofessional. Having compelling writing doesn’t necessitate that characters act like monsters or throw tantrums.

**Lack of Diversity:** Other than Moses and maybe Gwen, I think that every single character in the game so far has the exact same one of two body options. Just with a small amount of height difference. Every female character has the same sized boobs and butt. I haven’t seen a single guy that looks like the Mountain from Game of Thrones or Timothée Chalamet. Everyone is just kind of… the same silhouette. [If you look at this image of eight characters from LiS1’s photography class, there are at least 6 different body types in that photo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/67/63/c5676322917334d9fc9634d43de0e25f.jpg).

**Goth Girl Assassin:** She is the least goth person I’ve ever seen. I really have to wonder if someone messed up her model. This NPC looks more like someone in the track suit mafia. Was Hot Topic closed on the day the game takes place?

**No Photo Mode:** This is just one of those things that I wish all games came with now. How am I supposed to deck out my phone wallpaper with glorious Maxings???

**Lack of Harold:** If I don’t get to meet Harold, Imma be pissed. Unless they pull a Rachel Amber with him and we only get to know of him from his effect on others.

**“Negative” Options Provide More Info:** I’m not sure if this was intentional, but regardless, I find it… strange. Many of the “negative” options in the game, like being mean to Lucas or Loretta, actually causes them to give you slightly more information for the mysteries you’re working on. This actually happens a lot. I’m not sure if Deck Nine thinks that “evil” players are just dumber and need more help, or if this was their way of rewarding people for trying something other than the “nice Max” approach?

**Audio:** I don’t think the audio issues I’ve been having in the game are related to the voice acting or the actual audio recording or audio engineering. I suspect they’re all related to the game’s audio queuing system and event triggers. This can be a major issue given that there are quests that only become available if you listen in to ambient conversations between NPCs, like the assassin bathroom quest. In almost all instances, it is very unclear when an ambient conversation has concluded and all dialog has been exhausted.

Here’s a short list of all the audio issues I’ve had:

1. Characters can sound far away because of the camera angle, even when you’re right next to them, like in Yasmin’s office.
2. Because of all the audio issues, it can make ambiguous lines seem even more ambiguous. Like Max’s thoughts going up to the overlook crime scene when she thinks, “Vibes here are way off.” But she says it in both realities. I’d change it to “The vibes are way off. In both realities.” I thought it was just a bugged hint trying to tell me to hop realities.
3. The Christmas ornament will consistently have Max monologue over herself.
4. The “default” option for tips has Max suggesting tips far too quickly and far too frequently.
5. Stilted audio from the tablet in the FAB with Amanda discussing poop. In fact, listening to the “poo tablet” is the worst audio in the game. Its pauses between each of the lines are way too long.
6. Stilted audio for the Diehard Lucas Fan and the Undecided Lucas Fan, Shiloh and Alexa.
7. Wrong universe audio? In the FAB, there’s a mention of “No penguin head in the spokes” when looking at a painting. I looked for this forever, but only found it later when I was in a different universe. I think it’s supposed to be Max coming into contact with the penguin head version first, then commenting on it being different. But in all of my playthroughs, it was only ever mentioned with the non-penguin head version, and I hadn’t been to the other universe version yet.
8. In the FAB, there’s a mention of “even has her hair buns” for the Amanda painting, but the painting doesn’t have hair buns. It’s got her bangs. But no buns.
9. The sound of the portals is very annoying. As someone with misophonia, I literally hate it. I had to turn the sound effect volume almost entirely off. It just hits a pitch or a frequency that my brain can’t take. My ears physically hurt hearing it.
10. I guess this might be more an animation thing, but characters don’t look at each other when they speak outside of a “cut scene.”
11. Maybe another animation thing, but mouths don’t always move when characters are speaking during non-cut scenes.
12. You can hear the True Believer and the Cryptid Enthusiast anywhere in the North Quad once you run past them.
13. Max’s inner monologue often talks over her speaking in conversations, like with Diamond when she’s near the bench.

 

**Other Issues:**

These are kind of just weird things I noticed or was confused by.

1. If you change Loretta’s grade, Max makes some kind of mention of the “other Loretta.” Maybe I missed something, but the name on the paper is Loretta Rice, and that is the podcasting Loretta, yes?
2. Max presses either the button 1 or the button 3 on Gwen’s answering machine. But I think it’s segregated by universe? She only ever seems to press the same button three times for all three options. Weird that there are seemingly only two separate animations, and that they don’t seem to play correctly.
3. Max pours water behind Gwen’s plant if she waters it. Just right past the planter.
4. There are a lot of reused names from LiS1, BtS, and even DE itself. Lucas has an agent named Sammuel. Victoria has a CrossTalk exchange with a Drew (not sure if he’s supposed to be the same Drew from BtS). The statue of David and David Madsen, of course. Pauline the plant in the library that Max names, and the name Pauline actually comes up elsewhere in DE. There are other examples, too. Maybe Max is just dreaming all of this and her brain is recycling everything from her previous experiences?
5. Depending on what you do and the options you pick, Gwen can say, “I didn’t even ask for your company.” Except she did, because I tried to walk past and she called me over.
6. No inventory option to view items, like the “sinister candy” once you pick it up. It’d be nice to have an inventory that you can access from your phone maybe? Or a separate UI element for her bag that Max wears all the time.
7. The journal doesn’t remember what page you’re on and you can’t wrap around. So trying to use the journal is a pain in the butt.
8. In fact, nothing wraps around. Except the CrossTalk app, and that “breaks” when you do.
9. There are a lot of broken doors, like Gwen’s office and the Turtle’s patio doors which look open even when they’re closed. And Lucas’s briefcase appears open even before unlocking it.
10. Object permanence. Max drops the mystery phone, and it disappears. There’s a sharpie next to the Lucas standee but you can’t use it and once you’re done using the sharpie you get from the coffee shop, the standee’s sharpie is gone.
11. Once he gets his phone, Vinh’s character model didn’t load, so he was invisible. This happened in two of my three playthroughs.
12. The text messages should really have had dates and timestamps. And there should be an easily discernible “new” or “unread” signifiers to disambiguate between older messages and newer ones.
13. A secondary left-most column in CrossTalk which is only present if there are any unread updated threads which only display new entries would have been nice. Then it could collapse when everything is read.
14. Some things don’t make sense unless you take a specific path. Like commenting that the photo of the dog named Chloe was a “sign,” in the timeline where you sacrificed Chloe. What would it have been a sign of in that case? That Chloe was reincarnated as a dog?
15. No one sleeps on a bed without using blankets! Max might be autistic, but she’s not a monster.
16. Speaking of how humans work, most people don’t put their underwear and bras back on after a bone session before going to sleep. If you don’t want to show nudity, just frame the shots differently, or have someone pulling blankets over themselves.
17. Even if Chloe was sacrificed, Max still went out wandering the US? They do address this as “yes, she did,” but it seems weird to me.
18. Too many duplicate NPCs. At first I thought this was just the same characters between realities, but I’m pretty sure at this point that half the student population is the same olive-skinned young lady with heavy eyeshadow and brown hair.
19. Fairly common animation glitches that result in floating objects. Like a floating e-cig behind Reggie.
20. Does Max have an office? Where’s her lecture hall? I hope we get to see these things at some point.
21. Weird that the pulse doesn’t follow Max. First pulse literally cuts Diamond out of its radius if you use it when the game tells you to, so Moses just has a disembodied voice speaking to him.
22. Should have had another QTE for things like the “Press L1 to reach Safi” first time use of jumping. Tapping the button doesn’t give the same “feel” as having to hold a button down. There’s already an accessibility option to disable that if need be.
23. It takes Max too many instances to “get” the effects of the reality hop. “Wasn’t Krampus canceled?” Yes Max, you literally just looked at the soup board and realized that the date is the same and concluded you’re hoping realities. “Oh yeah, two Turtles, two Amandas.” Come on Max!

 

**CLUES:** I don’t want to spend too much time on this, in case they turn out to be pretty spoilery, but I thought these were minor details that were interesting.

1. Maybe like Jefferson’s first-ish lines in LiS1, one of the first things Safi discusses in DE is her “undergrad friend,” who I assume is Maya Okada. I imagine she’s going to factor into the mystery.
2. Before you get your reality hoping powers, Reggie and Diamond are in opposite chairs in the first Polaroid from where they’re sitting in the game.
3. In the bowling alley, Max claims not to “rearrange the space if she can help it,” but that’s all she does in the game! Including exchanging assorted unassembled telescope parts and an assembled telescope with each other between different realities while a detective is looking at them. Also, where’d that second footstool come from? And how is anyone going to go to the bathroom in one of the Turtles now!!!

Anyway, I have really enjoyed the first two chapters, and I hope the game continues to be great. It would be nice to see some of the issues here cleaned up with patches. But as long as the last three chapters don’t do something nuts, like it turns out that Max has just been in purgatory all along or something, then I think DE will be a great addition to a great series. I hope others that give it a chance find as many cool things about it as I did.",9,1729631249.0,lifeisstrange,1,0.76,False

1g9t2kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/1g9t2kt/review_of_section_hike_in_new_york_state_the_only/,Review of Section Hike in New York State: The Only Transit-Accessible Section!,"I just completed a 6 day section hike of the AT from Greenwood Lake, NY to the border of NY and CT.

This hike is, as far as I can tell, the most transit-connected section of the Appalachian Trail, bar none. 

This post will be a review of this section, as well as a guide for people less intrigued with or familiar with transit. I will be cross-posting this to subreddits like r/transit.

So, I live in New York City, and my ""Starting point"" is the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

There are two buses which go directly to Greenwood Lake, NY, an Appalachian Trail town, with just a 0.9 mile spur trail that connects the bus stop directly with the trail. These are the New Jersey Transit (initialized as ""NJT) buses 196 and 197, heading for Warwick, NY. There timetables change depending on what day you start (weekday, versus weekend or holiday), but both buses, for just $15.20, will take you from the heart of Manhattan out to Lake Greenwood to begin your hike. Tickets can be purchased at the bus terminal itself, or online using the NJT mobile app. The bus is largely completely empty by the time it gets there.

Once there, you can buy lunch and even dinner at any of the restaurants in the small town, then immediately begin your hike, at mile 1378.3. I opted to go north (colloquialized as ""NOBO"", short for ""northbound"", with matching ""SOBO"" using the same pattern).

The most logical ending point would be the aptly named Appalachian Trail stop on the Metro North Harlem line, which is at mile 1454.4, a full 76.1 miles away from the Lake Greenwood start. This station notably only runs on weekends and holidays. It is possible to simply walk south towards the city of Pawling, NY, alongside the tracks for just over 45 minutes to reach regular weekday train service to return to New York.

This 76.1 mile hike can be extended to the Connecticut border, at mile 1461.3, making it an even 83 miles. The New York State section in its entirety is 91 miles, starting from the New Jersey border. 

I did the hike in later October, 2024, during peak leaf, and it was an astoundingly beautiful time to do it. The temperatures aren't bad at all, and it doesn't get too cold, and every view is made better by the changing leaves. The colors of the Hudson Valley make some parts of this hike very popular and crowded, especially around Bear Mountain Inn and Harriman State Park, but, for the most part, the trail was completely quiet, except for the occasional fellow hiker going SOBO to Georgia. 

The best part of the New York section of the Appalachian Trail is a practice known as ""Deli Blazing"". This means that most people opt to not carry tons of traditional hiker food, because they don't need to, as there are many restaurants and delis and snack bars on or adjacent to the trail. This allows hikers to eat better while also carrying less weight - a double-win when hiker food is usually so gross and every ounce of weight on your back makes the hike so much harder!

From Greenwood Lake, NY, where I started, there are many restaurants to choose from for your first lunch and dinner. Within the first 10 miles there is a hotdog stand and Bellevale Creamery, offering high-calorie full-fat ice-cream and great views, and a massive old leather-bound hikers log that they'll ask you to sign if your backpack looks big enough. 

Near Mombasha Lake, the next day, there is a brewery called Foreign Objects Beer Company, which gives hiker-pricing for local craft beers, has delivery menus available, and is currently working on getting their own kitchen set up. Then there is a NJT station at Newburgh Junction, just before the Lemon Squeezer rock feature, with BERG and MAIN line NJT trains taking you directly back to New York City if you want to cut it short.

At Tiorati Lake, there are vending machines set up with a surprisingly great selection of snacks, far healthier than the usual fare you'd expect. I bought some locally-made oatmeal cookies, some biscuits, and, of course, some junk food too (purple Doritos and a candy bar). At the summit of Bear Mountain, a similar set up vending machines are set up, with a similarly impressive selection. All machines are equipped with contactless credit card payment, meaning you don't have to be weighed down with coins, saving you weight.

At the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area detour crossing, I stumbled upon the Bear Mountain Oktoberfest event, which I did not know was going on, but was happy about, as I could get two bratwursts, four beers, and enjoy a nice sunny picnic table as I answered questions from strangers about my giant backpack, and whether or not I'd seen any bears yet. It is unlikely you'll have my same luck, so checking upcoming events on [https://visitbearmountain.com/](https://visitbearmountain.com/)

At Bear Mountain State Park, I enjoyed eating like a dang gorilla at the Hiker's Cafe, where hot food and coffee is served daily. There are other restaurants as well, but it's quite clear that the staff instead to keep the stinkier hikers away from the more elegant places around there. 

Here is also where most of the ""civilization"" is, which means restaurants and transit, but also means Muggles (a slightly derogatory term that thru-hikers use to describe day-hikers who are often ill-equipped and not familiar with the etiquette of natural areas, especially regarding Bluetooth speakers in backpacks).

Here you can find buses directly back to NYC, and even riverboat cruises as well. There are two train stations on the opposite side of the Hudson, which you will be crossing this day of your hike, one at the nearby Manitou station on the east side of the Hudson River, served by Metro North's Hudson Line, and another stop on the same line in the town of Peekskill. Both will bring you directly back to Manhattan. 

Continuing, you pass the famed Appalachian Market, a gas station, deli, restaurant, and beer store all in one, just mere inches off of the Appalachian Trail. Here I ate a double-decker 1lb cheeseburger, and got another sandwich for dinner, and then yet another sandwich for breakfast the next day. That evening, I stayed at the Graymoor Spiritual Center, which is both a monastery and a rehabilitation center. They ask that you not bring any alcohol here. 

At Canopus Lake Beach, during the high season (Memorial Day until Labor Day), there is a very well-reviewed BBQ shop called ""SMOK'D"", run by a very well-liked gentleman named Jeremy. Unfortunately, the place was closed for the season when I arrived at Canopus Lake. I'll have to come back in the summer!

In the town of Stormville is a very well-liked pizza restaurant called Corrado's Pizza, and next door is the Stormville Market, where they make amazing sandwiches. Here I got four massive slices and two beers for lunch, and then a #1 Spicy Italian sandwich for dinner that night, and a sausage-egg-and-cheese for breakfast the next day. 

The next day, you'll pass through the ""Appalachian Trail"" Metro North Harlem Line platform. As mentioned earlier, trains only stop there on the weekends. From here, if it's not a weekend, you can turn directly south and walk along the tracks for about 45 minutes until you reach the town of Pawling, where you can catch the train going right back to Penn Station. There are also multiple food trucks at this exact junction, serving up amazing grub. I got Malaysian food at the ""DC Malaysian"" food truck, which, as you can tell from this picture, was incredible. A nice trucker even paid for my meal, doing a bit of trail magic. 

I, however, was not quite ready to leave the trail just yet. Because the AT cuts up north so steeply, I figured I could get into CT and then walk (or hitchhike) to the Wingdale - Harlem Valley Metro North train station. The last could miles of the hike were pretty bad road-walking, with a narrow shoulder and speeding cars. Quite uncomfortable. Luckily, on the way out, I hitchhiked with a lovely couple - Mana and Patience were their trail names, as they hiked the trail back in the 1970s, and now are retired in Wingdale, doing trailbuilding to keep the hands muddy. 

The Metro North Harlem line north of the confusingly-named Southeast, NY, is a diesel engine, so a very convenient cross-platform transfer is necessary at the Southeast station. And from there, in the electrified section of the Harlem line, it is just a quick 90-ish minutes back to Penn Station. 

This section is, by far, the most transit-accessible part of the entire almost 2200 miles of the Appalachian Trail. It is the only place on the entire trail with a direct *named* station stop. But compared to the other states on the AT (Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), New York is surely the most transit connected. 

Even New Jersey, a close second in national conversations about regional rail availability, seems to miss the mark when it comes to trail access. Where NJT provides the aforementioned 196/197 bus to Greenwood Lake, and the BERG and MAIN lines to Port Jervis, there are no transit connections at all anywhere south of these two places. Meaning that going SOBO from the two southernmost connections (Port Jervis or Greenwood Lake), means that there is not another transit connection until Stroudsburg, PA (at mile 1297.5). Which offers, at best, a 9+ hour return to New York via multiple Greyhound transfers.  And, embarrassingly, still a 6.5+ hour multi-seat trip to Philadelphia. 

The rest of PA is similar: remote, far from any major city, and completely severed from said cities due to unavailable transit. At least around Harrisburg, PA, (AT miles 1130 to 1150, and requires a long hike to town, or a hitchhike), there is a reasonable two and a half hour train trip to Philadelphia via the Amtrak Keystone. Tragically, this requires more than 200 miles of hiking, which is a shame, because it prevents these trips from happening as most would-be hikers can't obtain 2-3 weeks off just to hike this (notably rocky) section. 

The only other southern transit connections that are notable are at Harpers Ferry, WV. This has both Amtrak and Maryland's MARC service (though with a very confusing and inflexible schedule) to Washington, D.C.

Some minor bus connections exist in Virginia's Front Royal, at the northern tip of the Shenandoah National Park, which is contemporaneous with the Appalachian Trail for more than a hundred miles, (my first ever section of the AT that I did years ago). And there is also Roanoke, VA, at mile 728.6, which requires a pretty significant hike in, but has occasional train service to DC. From there, there is nothing else. Not even Springer Mountain, the very start of the trail, sees any transit connection at all to Atlanta, GA, forcing would-be thru-hikers to coordinate rides just to start. 

Going north is no different. Pittsfield, MA is the only place between Massachusetts and Connecticut that has any transit connections at all, and they quite sparse, and using them also requires a significant hike into town, though a strange disjointed bus system could be used to knock the 2h15m hike down to just over an hour if you're willing to do some transfers. North of that, even relatively transit-rich New England has 11+ hour connections to Boston or New York with multi-seat transfers.

I know that the Appalachian Trail is supposed to be remote, and difficult, but this abject failing of local transportation planning does not help the AT. We all know the positive economic and cultural effects that the Appalachian Trail has one many of these trail towns, and we all know how lovely these beautiful places are. Public transit helps to protect them by ensuring that they are visitable *and* that they are protected from the dangers of car-dependent suburban development patterns that does far more to destroy forestland and agricultural land than a pair of train tracks ever will. 

It's frankly apparent that the vast majority of these towns and cities have zero transportation goals, and likely aren't even aware of the intricacies of the Appalachian Trail and the innate car-free nature of it. By creating transit options that are conducive to thru-hiking, local communities can see increased economic traffic while also having decreased emissions-causing car traffic. It increases access while also ensuring that they are not over-touristed, as the effort to undergo a multi-hour bus or train trip is still not easy enough to lead to the issues that US National Parks see - that congestion is attributable to the fact that those places are only reachable by car. 

Anyway, it was a great section, and made better by being driven to and from the trailheads. Transportation on the AT is currently not even an afterthought - its not thought about at all, except, apparently, in New York State. And that's why I love my state so much!

Notable things I saw/did:

* All the delis
* The colors of the leaves
* The Graymoor Spiritual Center
* Canopus Beach Lake
* Seeing the white glowing eyes of a bear in the woods at night (scary)
* The Appalachian Trail train stop
* The Metro North Harlem line return to the city. 

How would you improve public transportation access on and around the Appalachian Trail?

Hey

It's been a 4 months since I joined a new position still I have no one whom can I drink coffe or have lunch 

On the hand people tend to look at me, women stare at me heck even some men stare at me or group of people turning there head towards when I am at the coffee machine I noticed multiple times. Yet no one comes over to me and talks to me.

I don't understand why what's wrong with tem, I know they are noticing me what's the problem, why I have to be the one to strike up the conversation 

When I do talk to them first everyone is so welcoming and nice. 

It's not that I have ego that why I have to be the one who talks first but the problem is I cannot the anxiety don't allow me to start a conversation with someone

I am stuck in a visious loop I know people notice me but they don't come over nor I go due to anxiety the result??

I believe i have had 2 male false twins: 1 i met in 2007 and 1 i met in 2021. I later felt that the first false twin was helping me work out annoying knots about myself and the second was working out what the first could/did not. When we separated, i felt that our time was just.. over. Despite the pain, i was grateful that they’d come into my life.

One of my partners had all the signs even though i kept trying to ignore them and, despite everything, calling him my tf just.. doesn’t sit? It’s odd. It’s like no matter the way we met or that all the signs are there, twin flame just doesn’t fit. He feels the same so i feel like we may just be turbulent soulmates (my other soulmate is an extremely peaceful soulmate). I’d given up and started to think that either tf’s weren’t real or that i just wasn’t ready for mine and i was ok with that.

Fast forward to about 9 weeks ago i added her on social media bc she made me laugh unusually hard in a couple of silly comments. For some reason i could not not stay connected to her. I never add random people to my private profile. I have few people on it and i know all of them.. but i added her. When i saw her i got that familiar feeling but didn’t think anything of it and i was certainly too chicken to approach her bc i didn’t know her sexuality and didn’t want to come off as creepy. When i disclosed that i was bi/poly in my bio, she started liking my photos and stories. For some reason i didn’t remember how i met her, but every time she liked something i got an urge to message her. I finally did so the other night and.. she said she’d been trying to get up the courage to message me but she was so awkward and shy around other females. Just like me.

She immediately told me that she’d love to meet me and go get coffee or a drink or something and i would have fallen all over myself to burst out a “YES YES I WILL ANYTIME” but i managed to calmly say yes (though im worried that my forced calm may have given the wrong idea).

During that conversation something happened.. this burst of attachment or white light.. out of nowhere. I have barely spoken to this person and it was like i was hit in the chest with a star, i even felt a little dizzy and some sort of.. euphoria. Y’all… i kid you not… i can’t stop thinking about her.. im even dreaming about her. Is this.. my tf?? This is nuts!!!

Not only is he extremely physically attractive, his character is also attractive - particularly that he’s thoughtful, layered, loyal, and direct about his feelings. I also found it refreshing that the FL was direct and smart, instead of the stereotypical clueless FL.  

I also really liked the ML in Lovely Runner - he was so loyal, charming, and endearing to the FL and the romance in that drama was top-notch. 

I’m going to withdrawal after watching these two recently 😩

I get frustrated by some typical tropes such as third-act breakups, major misunderstandings late in the drama, lies/sacrifices in the name of “love”/nobility, and distracting villains with nonsensical motives — though I will tolerate them if the enjoyability of the overall plot & characters make up for them.

1g9svql,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1g9svql/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_19/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 19 (Part 2)","The weekend before Christmas went by.  On Saturday, Jim spent some time in Ballantyne with his mother and two of his half-sisters.  They had dinner at a deli restaurant just off Johnston Road.  Jim told them about the get-together with Nikki and her son and daughter the previous evening.  Wendy said, “Jim, I do agree.  That get-together was just what Nikki and her kids needed, especially after all they’ve gone through.”

“Nikki asked about you and Emily and Charlie.”

Emily asked, “What did you tell her?’

Jim answered, “I told her you all were doing well.”

Then Charlie asked, “Are you and your girls ready for Christmas?”

Jim answered, “I guess we’re about as ready as we’re going to be.”

Then Wendy said, “It’s the same with us.”

Jim asked, “Are you three planning on coming to our house for Christmas?”

Wendy answered, “We most certainly are.”

Emily said, “I know you’d like it if we did.”

“Good.  Because it just wouldn’t be Christmas without you three.”

After dinner, they went to check out a new supermarket on Johnston Road.  Jim and Wendy got some more things for Christmas dinner (which would take place at Jim’s house).  Jim also got himself the latest edition of *Road and Track*, a couple Hot Wheels cars, and a small bottle of Coke to drink on the way home.  Not only that, Jim also got to try a sample of a kind of sushi called California Roll.  Jim thought it was pretty good.  He also thought that, someday, he would get himself some sushi to eat at home.  It was not the first time he ate sushi.  He tried it for the first time about a year ago.  Maybe Jim missed something by not eating it at first.  Jim was always open to new things, and he always tried to keep his options open.

Jim got home around nine o’ clock.  Valerie and Caitlyn were already in bed.  Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay were still up.  Jim told them about how the day with his mother and half-sisters went.  He also told them about sampling some sushi.  None of them could believe what Jim did.

 

😊

 

Christmas came.  It wasn’t a white one, but it was cold and rainy.  Caitlyn got her new bike, but she would have to wait about a couple days before she could try it out.  Lindsay got her new guitar.  She said it was better than the one she had.  All five girls got new clothes, iTunes cards and some new video games.  Valerie and Caitlyn each got an iPod.  The girls got Jim a new fishing rod and two video games, a car racing game and a golf game.

The rest of the week went by.  Then came New Year’s Day 2013. Ariel’s twins and Kendra’s baby had not yet been born, and their due dates had passed.  This would make for a great opportunity.

Jodi, Charmaine, Autumn and Siobhan had been wanting to hold baby showers for Kendra and Ariel for the past month or so, but their jobs kept them busy.  They knew they would have to move quickly because their due dates were approaching.  Those due dates were supposed to be in December.  Now, it was January.  The four decided it would be best to hold one baby shower for both Kendra and Ariel. 

They set it for the third Saturday in January of 2013.  Jim found an invitation to the baby shower in his mailbox in the first week of January.  At first, he seemed confused.  The invitation was addressed to his daughters and to Sydney.  Jim knew he would not be attending.  *Guys don’t attend those things*, Jim thought.  He did attend baby showers for Candi, but not really by choice.  After all, Jim was the father to all five of those girls.  Chelsea was the one who opened the invitation.  She did, however, allow Jim to see the invitation.  Jim got to see that his three oldest daughters were giving the baby shower, along with some of the other females in the neighborhood.  Jim knew there would be good food there, along with some of his good friends.  If it made Jim upset that he would not be there, he did not show it.

That Saturday came.  That morning, Jim went to Food Lion.  He decided to get him some snacks and Cokes for the evening ahead.  Jim got him a bag of Fritos, a box of Slim Jim beef snacks, a large case of Cokes, and two Milky Way and two Skor candy bars.  After he left Food Lion, he stopped at a Japanese restaurant on South Boulevard.  Jim got him a small package of sushi, along with some spicy sauce.  Just before he left, he was greeted by Amber, Amanda and Callie.  They had just left a Family Dollar which was next door to the restaurant.  Amanda asked Jim if he was going to be at the baby shower.  Jim answered, “Guys don’t attend those things.  So, I suppose I will be enjoying a nice, quiet evening at my house.”

Amber got a look in Jim’s bag.  She asked him, “Jim, when did you start eating sushi?”

Jim said, “Oh, about a year ago or thereabouts.  I sampled some at a supermarket that had just opened.”

Then Callie said, “Okay, Jim.  But please be careful.  I have heard stories of people getting sick from eating a certain kind of sushi.  I ate some once and got sick, and then…”

Amanda cut Callie off by saying, “Sister, no one needs to know about that.  Besides, it’s good Jim is trying something new.  No harm in that.”

Then Amber said, “We’ve been getting some stuff for the baby shower.”

Amber showed Jim what was in the Family Dollar bag.  Jim said, “That looks like some cute stuff.”

Then Amber said, “And Jim, as for guys not attending baby showers, you wouldn’t feel out of place.  Skylar’s going to be there, but not by choice.”

“Why?  He’s not the father of those babies.”

Amber said, “Jim, I don’t want Skylar at home by himself.  Not now, anyway.  I understand Ashley will have her son there.  They’ll be in a bedroom with Nelson.  I think they’re planning on playing video games or something.”

Jim looked at Amber for a moment, and he said to her, “That’ll be nice.”

Then Amanda said, “Sisters, we best be going.  We got stuff to do before the baby shower.”

Jim said, “Sure, ladies.  You all take care and enjoy the baby shower.”

And with that, the three Bianucci sisters got in Amber’s little white Honda, and they left the parking lot.  Jim got in his minivan, and then he started for his house.  Just as he made the turn onto Lexington Avenue, the minivan stalled.  Jim did manage to get the minivan into the parking lot of an office complex.  Jim called his house on his cell phone.  Lauren answered.  Jim asked, “Lauren, could you and your older sister please come and get me?”

“You mean in your Impala?” Lauren asked.

Jim knew Chelsea and Lauren were both careful drivers.  He only allowed them to use the minivan, and not his classic Impala.  But right now, he didn’t really have any choice but to trust them with his classic car.  Jim said to Lauren, “Yes.  I don’t care which one of you drives it, but please be careful with it.”

“Yes, Dad.  I suppose we could get you.  Where are you and what happened to the minivan?”

“I’m in the parking lot of the office complex at the corner of South Boulevard and Lexington Avenue.  I don’t know what happened.  The minivan just died on me.”

“Okay, Dad.  Stay put where you are.  Sydney’s still in bed.  Valerie and Caitlyn are in the front yard.  Lindsay in the house with me.  Chelsea and I are on our way.”

“Okay, Lauren.  Get Sydney out of bed any way you can and bring her with you.  Lindsay can watch Valerie and Caitlyn.”

“Okay, Dad.  We’ll head on over there.”

Jim and Lauren ended the phone call.  He stood next to the minivan.  Two female office workers passed by Jim.  A blonde and a brunette.  They were dressed very nice.  It looked like they were trying to flirt with Jim by the way they smiled at him.  One of them, a brunette who looked about like Zoe Marlowe, asked him, “Sweetie, is something wrong with your van?”

Jim answered, “Yes.  But my daughter is on her way to get me.”

The blonde woman said, “Okay.  You look too handsome to be stranded here.”

Jim said, “Thanks.  My girlfriend is on her way here, too.”

Both women gave Jim a rather serious look, and they were on their way. 

About twenty minutes after the phone call, Jim saw his red Impala.  The top was up, which did please Jim.  After all, it was the middle of January.  Lauren was driving, with Sydney riding shotgun.  Chelsea was in the back seat.  Lauren pulled into the parking lot, and she stopped where Jim was standing.  He said, “I sure am glad you all came.  I was just flirted with by two pretty women from the office complex.”

Sydney said, “I’m glad we showed up.  Maybe they wanted to drive you home.”

Jim said, “That wasn’t going to happen.”

Lauren said, “No telling what would have happened to Dad if they did.”

Jim told Lauren to get in the back seat.  After he locked up the minivan, he got in the driver’s seat, and he drove back to the house.  As soon as he got there, he put his snacks and Cokes away, and he put his sushi in the refrigerator.  After he got done, he called Scout at his Exxon station.  He asked, “Scout, could I see you and your tow truck as soon as possible?”

Scout answered, “Sure, Jim.  Something’s wrong with your minivan, I take it.”

“Yes, Scout.  You guessed it.  Sydney, Chelsea and Lauren just picked me up from the office complex at the corner of South Boulevard and Lexington Avenue.”

“Okay, Jim.  My two assistants can run the place while I come and get you.  I’ll be there as soon as possible in my tow truck.”

About fifteen minutes later, Scout showed up in his tow truck.  Jim directed Scout to where the minivan was.  Scout had no trouble getting his Ford tow truck into the small parking lot.  Scout managed to get the minivan hooked up.  Jim told Scout to take the minivan to the Exxon station and look at it.  At the gas station, Jim saw that April Lynn was there in her Dodge Challenger.  She was getting a can of Diet Coke from the drink machine.  Jim spoke to April Lynn while Scout checked out the minivan.  Scout was assisted by his two assistants, two young Mexican men.  One was named Fernando, and the other was named Pedro.  Scout introduced both men to Jim.  “*Hola*,” one of the men said to Jim.

Jim was struggling to figure out what the Mexican person was saying.  He held up his hand and said, “Sorry.  I don't speak Spanish.”

Scout was helpful.  He translated it for Jim to understand.  Scout said, “It’s okay, Jim.  He’s saying, ‘Hello’ in Spanish.”

Jim didn’t say a word.  He just waved his hand.  Fernando and Pedro waved back.  Then Scout said, “Jim, I am tied up with two other cars.  Would it be possible to let me check it out some more and call you Monday morning?”

Jim said, “Sure, Scout.  Do what you need to do.  You can call me at home or at the car dealership, or on my cell phone.”

At that moment, Jim took out his wallet.  Then he asked Scout, “How much do I owe you for the trip?”

Scout smiled and clapped Jim’s shoulder.  He said, “Jim Faulkner, forget about it.  It wasn’t far enough to worry about it.”

Everyone knew Scout was known to refuse payment for the use of his tow truck on some occasions, even though they offered to pay him for his trouble.  Jim said to Scout, “Okay.  But I still feel I owe you.  There’ll be a time and place.”

Scout went back to a car in one of the garage bays, one he was working on when Jim called him.  Jim walked to where April Lynn was standing.  She was working hard on her can of Diet Coke.  Jim got him a can of Coke out of the machine.  She asked him, “What’s wrong with the minivan?”

Jim answered, “I’m not sure.  It just went dead on me at the corner of South Boulevard and Lexington Avenue.”

“Any idea what it is?” April Lynn asked.

“I’m not sure.  Scout said he’d look at it and get back to me on Monday.”

April Lynn looked at Jim for a moment.  Then she said, “Okay.  I just hope it’s nothing major.”

“Yes, April Lynn.  So do I.”

Then April Lynn asked Jim, “Do you need a ride back to your house?”

Jim said, “It is a little chilly.  I suppose you could drive me to my house.”

It did not take long for April Lynn to drive back to Bethany Street.  On the way, Jim ate one of his candy bars.  He offered April one, but she declined.  As soon as she got to Jim’s house, she said, “I’m getting ready to go to Target and get something for the baby shower.”

“That’s nice.  I hope I didn’t mess up your plans.”

“No, Jim.  You didn’t.”

April Lynn got Jim home.  She went into the house with him.  She stayed with Jim for a few minutes just to make sure he was okay.  Just as she got ready to leave, Jim said to April Lynn, “I hope you all have a good time at the baby shower.”

April Lynn asked him, “Aren’t you going to be there for your friends?”

“Guys don’t attend those things.  I’ll just enjoy a nice, quiet evening at home.”

April Lynn got a look in one of Jim’s bags.  She made a face and asked, “Sushi, Jim?”

“Yeah.  I feel I should try something different.”

“Jim, times are changing, believe it or not.  You can and should attend the baby shower.  Mark and Simon will be there, and I’m sure you won’t feel out of place.”

“Yes, April Lynn.  But I know Mark and Simon will be there.  Not by choice.  After all, they are the fathers.  Will Ryan be there?”

“No.  He said he wanted to stay home and do some studying.”

“Okay, then.  I’m going to get out of this cold air.  You take care and I’ll speak to you some more later.”

“Yes, Jim.  Sure.  Tell your girls I’ll see them later this evening.”

Jim went into his house, and April Lynn drove back to East Morehead Street.  Jim put his snacks in one of the cabinets, and he put his Cokes and sushi in the refrigerator.  Meanwhile, his girls went to Autumn’s house to help get things ready for the baby shower.  Just as Jim was putting his food away, Sydney stepped into the kitchen.  Jim asked her, “Aren’t you going to go to your mother’s house and help get things ready for the baby shower?”

“Yes, Jim.  I’ll be going over there shortly.”

Sydney got a look at Jim’s food.  She asked him, “Is that what you’re planning on eating tonight?’       

“Yeah.  I’m planning on eating sushi and just enjoying the peace and quiet.”

“Okay, Jim.  I guess I’ll be getting ready for the baby shower.”

Then, Julie showed up.  She asked Jim, “Is Sydney ready?”

Jim said, “I think so, Julie.  I’ll go upstairs and check.”

Jim walked upstairs and went to the guest bedroom.  By the time he got there, Sydney was already ready and in the hallway.  She was wearing a white blouse with a lot of ruffles and a blue skirt and black high heels.  Jim said, “Oh, Sydney.  I’m glad you’re ready.  Julie’s downstairs and she’s waiting on you.”

Sydney said, “Oh, great.  We’re going to walk together to Autumn’s house.”

Jim said, “You look pretty, Sydney.”

Sydney smiled and said, “Thank you, Jim.”  Then the two kissed.

Jim and Sydney walked downstairs.  Julie was about as pretty.  She was wearing a baby blue dress with a lot of lace and ruffles, a dress she was known to wear in church, especially for baptisms.  Another outfit Julie wore for baptisms consisted of a white blouse and a silk scarf around her neck, tied to one side.  Julie asked Sydney if she was ready to go to Autumn’s house.  Sydney said she was.  They left for Autumn’s house.

Jim spent about an hour cleaning the house.  Svetlana had not been at the house for the past week.  Jim gave her a week off.  Svetlana would be back on Monday.  She did call Jim while he was cleaning house.  She said she would be in the neighborhood for the baby shower.  For the past few years, Svetlana had been making great progress in speaking English.  She did have some help from Jim and his friends. 

Just as Jim got done cleaning the house, Mark and Simon showed up.  Simon was wearing a black suit and a white dress shirt, and he was also wearing a bow tie.  Mark was also wearing a black suit and white dress shirt, but minus the bow tie.  Jim saw the two at the front door, and he said to them, “Boy, don’t you two look snazzy!”

Simon said, “Thanks, Jim.”

Then Mark said, “It was Simon’s idea.  He said we should look very nice for the baby shower, and for our wives.”

Jim said, “I’m sure your wives think you two look very nice.”

Simon said, “They said we do.”

Mark said, “Doctor Firestone said Kendra could attend if she took it easy.”

Then Simon said, “He said the same thing about Ariel.  I plan to take her in a wheelchair.”

“Same with Kendra,” Mark said.

Jim said, “Sure thing, guys.  Just remember what the doctor said.”

Simon said, “Yes, Jim.  We will.”

Mark said, “Simon, let’s get going.  We still need to get our wives.”

Simon said, “Yes, Mark.  You’re right.”

Then Mark asked, “Jim, are you going to be okay staying here by yourself?”

Jim said, “Of course I will.  I have stayed here by myself many times.  I have since I was about ten.  I’ll just eat some sushi and some Fritos, maybe a candy bar or two, drink some Cokes, listen to some music, and check out some car magazines.  I may even check out some of those copies of *Faerie Magazine* and *Top Gear Magazine* Nikki Crabtree gave me.”

Mark said, “Sure, Jim.  We did have a good time at Nikki’s house that evening.”

Simon said, “We’ll see you later, Jim.”

Mark and Simon walked to their houses to get their wives.  Jim closed and locked the front door.  He fed his cats and changed their litter.  Then he took a shower.

It was now six o’ clock.  The sun was beginning to go down.  Jim took his sushi out of the refrigerator, along with some soy sauce and some of the spicy sauce he bought when he sampled sushi at a supermarket.  He also made a tall glass of Coke, and he opened his bag of Fritos.

Jim grabbed some magazines off the coffee table, and he put them on an end table next to the sofa.  Jim turned on the stereo.  He put it on a classic R&B station, one that had just changed its format from Spanish music and speaking.  He opened the curtains so that he could see the Charlotte skyline.  By that time, there was an assortment of cars at Autumn’s house.  He saw Svetlana’s tiny blue Oldsmobile.  He also saw Nikki’s Camaro, Pam Gilmore’s Audi (Paulina was with her), Amy Courtland’s late-model Mustang, Rebecca’s brown Mercedes, Natalie McClendon’s little Honda Civic and Wendy’s BMW.  He also saw Renee and Rachel’s cars.  He also saw an unfamiliar Cadillac.  *A new model*, Jim thought.  Jim wondered who that new Cadillac belonged to.  He would soon find out.

Meanwhile, Jim ate his sushi, and enjoyed every bite.  He also ate some of his Fritos.  On the stereo, Johnny Bristol was singing a song about Morganton, North Carolina.  Jim stopped in Morganton many times during his trips to the mountains, especially to Asheville.  He usually ate breakfast at a buffet restaurant on Highway 18, just off Interstate 40.  Then, something came to Jim’s mind.  He had not been to the mountains in so long, and it had been a long time since he and his friends had been to Lansing, and to that little house.  Jim had a thought.  *Maybe when the weather gets a little better, me and my friends should take a trip up to Lansing.  Maybe it would do us good to check out that old place, and just to think about the good times*.  Jim would consider the idea.  Maybe his friends would go along with it. 

Jim changed the stereo to a soft rock station.  While Richard Marx was singing a song about a girl named Angelia, Jim got a call on his house phone.  He went to answer it.  He checked the caller ID.  As soon as he recognized the number, he answered it.  The number belonged to Zoe, and it was her cell phone.  Zoe said, “Hi, Jim.  We’re here for the baby shower.”

“Sure, Zoe.  It’s at Autumn’s house.”

“Yes, Jim.  We know.  Would it be okay if we parked our car in your driveway?”

“Yes, Zoe.  I’m not going anywhere this evening.”

“Thanks, Jim.  Mom’s driving the car.  We do appreciate it.”

After Jim and Zoe ended the phone call, he saw Cheryl Marlowe park her new Dodge Charger in the driveway.  Jim was still looking out the window when Cheryl, Allison, Zoe and Catalina got out of the car.  They all saw Jim.  All three gave Jim a wave, and they went on to Autumn’s house.  Then, Jim sat back down and went back to his magazine.

About a couple hours later, Sydney and Jim’s daughters returned home.  Autumn was walking behind them, and she had three unfamiliar women with her.  Autumn said, “Jim, there are three women I need you to meet.”

Autumn motioned the three women to step inside.  Autumn said, “Jim Faulkner, I would like you to meet my sister-in-law, Angelina McCall.  And with her are my niece, Quinn McCall, and her sister-in-law, Claire McCall.”

Jim said, “Pleased to meet you all.”

Then, it came to Jim.  A while back, he sold a truck to a man named Baker McCall.  *Oh, Autumn’s brother*, he thought.  Then, he remembered something else.  *Baker mentioned a daughter named Quinn, and a daughter-in-law named Claire*.  Then Jim said, “I remember now.  I sold a truck to your husband.”

Angelina said, “Yes, Jim.  I see you remember.”

Angelina looked to be around Autumn’s age.  She had brown hair and eyes, and she looked to be about four feet shorter than Autumn, who was quite tall.  Quinn was about a year older than Chelsea.  She had blonde hair.  Claire had just turned thirty-one.  She had brown hair.  Claire was married to Justin McCall, who was Baker and Angelina McCall’s son.  They just had a baby boy, and his name was Miles.  Angelina shook Jim’s hand, and she said, “Glad to know you, Jim.  Autumn and her kids tell me a lot about you and the others in this neighborhood.”

Jim said, “Thanks.  Word sure does get around.”

Then Autumn said, “Jim, I see you’ve been enjoying yourself this evening, with sushi, your car magazines, Fritos, candy, and Cokes and music.”

Jim said, “Yes, Autumn.  I have.”

Quinn said, “Pleasure to meet you, Jim.  I like a man who likes to try different things and keep his options open.”

“Thanks, Quinn.  Pleasure to meet you as well”

Then, four of Jim’s daughters showed up.  Jim asked where Caitlyn was.  Chelsea answered, “Aunt Renee’s bringing her home.”

Renee did show up, with Tia, Amina and Cassie walking beside her.  Renee was carrying Caitlyn.  Jim asked what happened.  Renee said, “She fell asleep.  Jim, I love you and your daughters, but your youngest daughter is getting a little bit too big to carry.”

Then Tia said, “Jim, we were playing some games this evening.  She was having a good time playing bingo with us.  She fell asleep without realizing she won a game.”

Jim said, “Oh, dear.  It is getting late and I know she’s tired.  Poor thing.”

Lindsay had a plate wrapped in Saran Wrap.  She handed it to Jim.  Lindsay said, “Dad, we weren’t sure if you were eating something good, so I ended up making this plate.”

Jim got a look at the plate.  There were two pieces of fried chicken (it looked like Kentucky Fried Chicken Original Recipe), potato chips (it looked like sour cream and onion), nachos (with salsa and cheese dip in a tiny bowl) and a piece of chocolate cake.  Jim said, “Thanks, girls.  I’ll enjoy it.”

Tia got a look around the living room.  She said, “Jim, I can see you enjoyed your evening.”

“Yes, Tia.  I most certainly did.”

Tia got a look at the sushi Jim had been eating.  She said, “Jim, I can see you like sushi.  When did you start eating it?”

“Oh, about a year or so.  I tried some at the grand opening of a supermarket recently.  I liked it.  I wanted to eat some this evening.”

“Would it be okay if I tried a piece?”

“It's a California roll, and it’s pretty good.  Sure, help yourself.”

While Tia was helping herself to a piece of sushi, Jim was watching Chelsea carry Caitlyn up the stairs.  Chelsea said, “Dad, I’ll put Caitlyn to bed.  That is, if I don’t put my back out before I get there.”

Jim said, “Thanks, Chelsea.  I appreciate it.”

Amina handed Jim something.  It was a Matchbox car, it was in a package, and it had not been opened.  Amina said, “Jim, Caitlyn won this as a prize when she fell asleep.  Would you see that she gets it?”

Jim got a look at it.  It was a 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle.  It was orange, a convertible, and it looked like it had B.F. Goodrich tires.  Jim said, “Sure, Amina.  I’ll see that Caitlyn gets this car.”

Amina stepped out the door.  Then Valerie said, “Dad, I won a car, too.  An Aston Martin.”

Jim looked at the car Valerie won.  It was also a Matchbox.  The car was a convertible, and it was green.  Jim said, “Valerie, that is one good looking car.”

Valerie quickly went upstairs to her room.  Everyone got ready to leave.  Rachel said, “Jim, we’ll see you tomorrow in church.”

Angelina, Quinn and Claire all told Jim how happy they were to meet him.  They would also see Jim in church the next morning.  Before he went to bed, Jim ate what was on that plate, and he also ate the last two pieces of sushi.  After he cleaned up the living room, he went on to bed.

 

😊

 

The next morning during services, Julie said, “Folks, I’m trying super hard to get things together.  I hope to hear from Lloyd and Gladys Burton sometime this week.  I know we’ve been at this for the past few weeks, and I know things seem to be moving slow.  I do want to get the ball rolling as far as trying to fix up the place.  Let’s hope for the best.”

Simon and Ariel’s twin girls were born on the last weekend of January of 2013.  The twin girls were born by cesarean, or C-section as many would call it.  Simon and Ariel had the names for the two girls planned for the past few months.  They would be known as Kaci Elizabeth Cavanaugh and Lucy Marie Cavanaugh.  At first, Nelson wanted Simon and Ariel to give both girls the middle name Elizabeth.  The parents wanted Marie for the middle names for both girls.  All three agreed on a compromise.  Marie would be in honor of Autumn (her middle name), and Elizabeth would be in honor of Charmaine (which was her middle name).

About a week and a half later, Mark and Kendra’s baby girl was born.  At first, there was some fear a C-section would be needed, but that did not turn out to be the case.  Mark and Kendra agreed on a rather unusual name.  Their baby would be known as Ambrosia Dawn Cavanaugh.",0,1729630621.0,writers,2,0.5,False
1g9stts,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g9stts/setup_opinion_looking_for_advice_on_how_to/,Setup opinion: Looking for advice on how to improve my coffee game,"Hello,

First time poster. I am looking to improve my daily coffee, and wanted to share my setup for some feedback.

I currently own a Niche Zero grinder and a Breville Bambino Plus Espresso machine. My grinder is great, and I think my biggest bang for my buck would be to upgrade my espresso machine to a dual boiler (maybe to a Lucca M58) but I am not certain. I own a naked portafilter and precision baskets that are 54mm and would need to be replaced if I upgraded my machine. I also enjoy the Breville instantly turning on (3 secs).

Some infos about my coffee behavior: I make 2-4 drinks a day, mostly lattes. I have been using whole milk but recently switched to lactose free milk (tastes sweeter). I order whole fresh beans from drinktrade and go through a large bag (or more) per month.

Regarding technique, I usually do double shots with 1:2 ratio starting 18g. I use the WDT method, followed by tamping. I used a level in the past but didn't see significant improvement. I tamp twice, once with a spring loaded tamper, which doesn't compact enough (and isn't larger enough to fit the 54mm basket), then with a heavier metal tamper. I wish I could tamp once using a nicer spring loaded metal tamper, but it's hard to find for 54mm portafilter. I then use a mesh filter and do some ""temperature surfing"" on the Breville Bambino by pulling an empty shot to let steam come out.

I feel like I don't know what I don't know at this point.

Happy to hear your thoughts!

I’ve lived in Albuquerque for years now and have had almost no luck meeting people to hang out with. I feel like whenever I feel like when I click with someone no one wants to commit to coffee or food or anything. I’m 28 and work full time at UNM. 

I like hitting up the local venues for the hardcore/metal scene. I love Sister Bar and Anodyne. Local DIY shows at the Minnow or Rens Den are so cool.

Other hobbies are just hanging out with my pets and video games. I love getting tattooed. Always open to new things and new spaces. 

Feeling kinda embarrassed posting this but anyone have any suggestions on where they frequent to meet some friends?

I might end up deleting this, but just wanted to see if anyone else has similar struggles in this city.

1g9sris,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1g9sris/my_open_letter_to_bm_org_regarding_the_closing_of/,My Open Letter to BM Org regarding the closing of Center Camp Cafe,"Center Camp Cafe was one of my preferred place to hang and meet people at Burning Man. Unfortunately, the cafe was closed by the BM Org, and it completely ""killed"" Center Camp, which used to be a very lively space where you would always meet cool people, and now sits empty most of the times.

BM Org should re-open the Center Camp Cafe, with some changes to address some of the issues:

BM Org wrote ( [https://journal.burningman.org/2022/02/black-rock-city/building-brc/center-camp-coffee/](https://journal.burningman.org/2022/02/black-rock-city/building-brc/center-camp-coffee/) ):

>Black Rock City is a continuously evolving, living experiment. As we shared at the end of last year, we will no longer do coffee sales at Center Camp in 2022. \[...\]. This decision is ever so bittersweet, and it was not made lightly. Making this choice aligns with Burning Man Project’s long term sustainability goals and initiatives and the Principle of Decommodification.

Decommodification? But BM Org still sells ice, right? Personally I don't use ice to conserve my fresh fruits and veggies! There are other ways to keep food cool, e.g. a wet towel (that can be kept wet by dripping water) over a plastic box, in a shadowed place. Using water evaporation to keep food cold is way more sustainable than using ice! Also, there are lots of naturally preserved food that do not require refrigeration.

Also, the fact that it costs about $700 (taxes, fees and vehicle pass included) means that Decommodification does not apply outside the perimeter of Black Rock City?

If BM Org was selling coffee coupons by mail before the event, would it be considered Decommodification, as no money would change hands at the coffee? So much irony in the BM Decommodification concept...

>While coffee sales have been in decline the last few years

Coffee price is probably the main reason. Maybe don't sell a cup of coffee for $5 or $7? If coffee was $2, I would buy more often.

>and operational costs have risen, the environmental footprint of the café has become difficult to justify. The operation uses a great deal of fuel yearly between power, refrigeration

You would not need refrigeration if you were using dried powdered milk instead of fresh milk. Did you ever think about that?

>and transport, and generates egregious amounts of waste, such as 30,000 cups

Just do NOT provide cups! Ask people to come with their own cups if they want to buy coffee or other drinks.

>thousands of plastic milk containers,

Seriously, as I said, why not use bulk powdered milk? No refrigeration, no containers, and once it is mixed in coffee or the, you cannot really tell the difference in terms of taste.

>and 25,000 gallons of greywater.

That looks like a lot, where does all that greywater comes from? Just cleaning the coffee machines and utensils should not generate remotely that much.

>And, coffee commerce in the center of our decommodified city has been a point of perennial debate for years. Experimenting with no coffee sales in 2022 is a tangible example of Burning Man Project’s commitment to our values.

True, but this experience (i.e. closing the cafe) did not work, and it basically ""killed"" Center Camp, which has now become a ghost town, while it was one of the most lively forum in the city. So sad.

A lot of the comments were telling her that he does not love her, etc due to the way he was talking to her. I also a post about Tyler from Teen Mom who commented he “didn’t want a heifer for a wife” and the people commenting made the same comments as the first video. I have also always had the belief that the way someone talks to you is telling of how they feel about you. 

This made me think about this one couple I know, Matt (25M) and Jessica (25F). They’ve been together forever and have a kid together, so I always thought they were “couples goals” until I got to know them a bit more. The more time I spent with them, the more I saw Matt start talking to Jessica the same way as those men in those videos. He’s always making jokes at her expense, talking down at her at times, and even started arguing with her multiple times in front of me. For example, I was over at their house when Jessica started complaining about his mom not doing anything around the house and he started arguing with her about how she should be more grateful to his mom. She started saying “well I do x, y, and z” and he started sarcastically clapping at her. I was extremely grossed out by him at that moment and told my partner he needs to talk to Matt about how he talks to Jessica. At the same time, he does seem pretty devoted to her. Always telling her he loves her on social media, talking about her with a lot of love while on the phone with my Fiancé, checking up on her if he’s away for even an hour, etc. 

I guess my point is, does talking down at your partner always mean they don’t love you? Do actions mean more in situations like this? Just trying to decide whether its my place to talk to Jessica about how Matt talks to her, or if maybe I’d be crossing the line because maybe the way he talks to her doesn’t really mean anything?

1g9sddi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9sddi/my_old_late_night_job_came_with_rules_this_is_why/,My old late night job came with rules. This is why I left. ,"I’ve worked the night shift at **Ruby’s Diner** for the past few months. The money’s decent, and I don’t mind the peace and quiet after the dinner rush ends. Ruby, the owner, keeps things running smoothly, but there are… rules.

The first time Ruby gave me the list, I thought she was joking. The place is clean, no major pest problems, nothing that screamed ""haunted"" or anything. But she was dead serious.

**1. Never let the front door open after 11:00 p.m. No matter who or what knocks.** **2. The jukebox will play by itself sometimes. Do not unplug it. Just let it finish the song.** **3. If the man in the gray suit comes in, serve him a cup of coffee—black. Do not speak to him, and do not make eye contact.** **4. Keep all the lights on. Every single one.** **5. At 3:15 a.m., you’ll hear the phone ring. Do not answer it.**

I’d laughed at the rules when I first read them. Ruby was always a bit quirky, but this seemed like next-level weird. She stared at me with a look that shut me up real fast.

“It’s not a joke, and if you can’t handle it, don’t come back,” she said, her voice cold and serious.

I shrugged it off. What’s the worst that could happen? Ghostly jukebox tunes? An old guy who wants coffee? I thought I’d handle it fine.

The first few nights were uneventful. Yeah, the jukebox played a few times on its own, but it was always old, scratchy songs—nothing creepy, just odd. I kept the lights on, locked the door at 11:00 p.m., and everything was fine.

Until last Tuesday.

It started around 11:30 p.m. I was wiping down the counter when I heard knocking at the door. Three steady knocks. I froze, staring at the clock on the wall. It was definitely after 11:00 p.m.

Another three knocks. Louder this time.

I glanced through the glass door, but no one was there. My heart pounded. I wanted to open it, to check, but the rule was clear: **Don’t open the door.**

I backed away slowly and went to the kitchen, trying to distract myself with cleaning.

The knocking didn’t stop.

It went on for almost an hour, constant and steady, like whoever—or whatever—it was, knew I was inside and was waiting for me to crack.

Finally, it stopped. But that was when the jukebox started.

Without warning, it lit up and started playing some old jazz tune I didn’t recognize. The air in the diner felt colder. I remembered Ruby’s second rule: **Don’t unplug it. Let it finish.**

The song went on for what felt like forever. I kept wiping the same spot on the counter, trying to ignore the eerie melody. When it finally stopped, the diner went dead silent again.

I thought that was the end of it for the night, but at around 1:00 a.m., the door swung open, even though I knew I’d locked it. A man stepped inside. He wore a gray suit, just like Ruby had warned.

I froze, my mind racing. **The man in the gray suit.** I quickly poured a cup of coffee and slid it onto the counter without saying a word, keeping my eyes on the floor. I could feel him watching me, but I didn’t look up.

He sat down at the corner booth and sipped his coffee slowly, the sound of his slurping making my skin crawl. Minutes passed, maybe hours, I couldn’t tell. When I finally built up the courage to glance in his direction, he was gone. The coffee cup sat there, still full.

I was shaking, but I made it through the rest of the night without anything else happening. That is, until 3:15 a.m.

The phone rang.

I stared at it, my mind screaming not to answer. The ringing was loud, persistent. It wasn’t the regular sound of a phone ringing. It was deeper, distorted, like something was trying to call from somewhere it shouldn’t.

It rang again, then again. I backed away from the counter, my back pressing into the wall, heart racing in my chest. I could almost hear Ruby’s voice in my head: **Do not answer it.**

I don’t know how long it rang before it finally stopped. But when it did, I realized something horrible.

The lights had flickered off.

Every single one.

I was standing in the middle of a pitch-black diner, alone—or at least, I hoped I was alone. I fumbled for the light switches, flipping them over and over, but nothing happened.

I felt the floor creak behind me, like someone—or something—was walking toward me. Cold air brushed my neck, and I could hear faint breathing. I didn’t dare turn around. My mind raced. The rules didn’t say anything about what to do if the lights went out.

My only option was to wait.

I closed my eyes, standing completely still, willing the lights to come back on. The breathing behind me grew louder, closer, until I could feel the cold presence hovering just inches away from me.

Then, as quickly as it started, it stopped.

The lights flickered back on.

I spun around, but there was nothing there—just the empty diner, the same as before. But on the counter, the phone was off the hook, swaying slightly as if someone had just hung up.

I didn’t wait for the shift to end. I grabbed my things and bolted out of the diner, breaking the rule about keeping all the lights on.

The next morning, Ruby called me. “You left in the middle of your shift,” she said, her voice eerily calm. “I told you to follow the rules.”

“I did,” I stammered. “The door stayed locked, I didn’t answer the phone, I—”

“You let the lights go out.”

I froze. How did she know?

“They’ll be back for you, you know,” she continued, her voice barely above a whisper. “Once you break the rules, they don’t stop.”

I haven’t gone back to Ruby’s since that night. But every night, at 3:15 a.m., my phone rings.

And I never answer it maybe that is for the best maybe that's why I'm still alive.",2,1729629321.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

She has recently reached out to a few different friend groups (3-4 people and I’m in both), inviting us to get together. It has been YEARS for one friend group, so I can only imagine it is to promote her new “miracle cure” and try to get us on board. I’d actually really like to see these people and visit but I don’t want to spend the entire time (or any time, actually) listening to a sales pitch. 

How have you GENTLY declined someone without offending them? I have in the past but this time she seems to be very pushy in her online posts.

You're that person who can taste ""notes of blackberry and caramelized almonds"" in your cup. You're the one who scoffs at instant coffee and chuckles knowingly when someone mentions Keurig. Now, it’s time to up your coffee game with a grinder! But... should you go with a **burr grinder** or a **blade grinder**? It’s the ultimate showdown of precision versus... chaos. Let’s dive in.

  
At the end of the day, choosing between a burr grinder and a blade grinder comes down to how much control (and flavor) you want in your cup. If you’re the kind of person who stares at a Chemex and sighs lovingly, do yourself a favor and get a burr grinder. Your morning ritual will transform into something sublime. If you’re just looking for a quick caffeine fix, the blade grinder will suffice—but don’t expect a perfect cup.

# The Blade Grinder: The Wild Child of Coffee Grinders

Let’s start with the blade grinder, the rebellious little sibling of the grinder family. Picture this: a small machine with a spinning blade that chops your coffee beans into oblivion. No rules. No control. Just pure, unfiltered randomness.

**Pros**:

* **Affordable**: If you’ve blown your budget on rare single-origin beans that sound more like wine labels than coffee, a blade grinder will seem like a blessing. They can be as cheap as $20, leaving more room for those precious beans.
* **Simple**: Plug it in, press a button, watch it whirr. Blade grinders are straightforward, like your mom’s blender—but with less margarita potential.

**Cons**:

* **Inconsistent grind**: The blade grinder is the coffee equivalent of playing darts with your eyes closed. Sometimes you’ll get big chunks of beans, sometimes you’ll get powder. It’s all very exciting until you realize that uneven grind means uneven extraction, leading to coffee that can taste bitter *and* sour in the same sip. Mmm... not so delightful.
* **Flavor sabotage**: The fast-moving blade heats up the coffee beans as it grinds, which can mess with the delicate oils and aromas that make specialty coffee so delicious. Think of it like giving your beans a hot yoga session they never asked for.

# The Burr Grinder: The Control Freak of Coffee Grinders

Now, let’s meet the burr grinder. If the blade grinder is a chaotic artist, the burr grinder is a German engineer. Precision. Consistency. Excellence. This machine uses two abrasive surfaces (burrs) to crush your coffee beans into uniform particles, like a pro.

**Pros**:

* **Consistent grind**: A burr grinder gives you the same grind size every time. Whether you're brewing for espresso, pour-over, or French press, you’ll get just the right particle size, which means optimal extraction. Translation: your coffee will taste like the nuanced nectar of the gods it was meant to be.
* **Flavor preservation**: Burr grinders work at a slower speed, generating less heat. This means your beans won’t lose their oils and aromas. No overheating = no sad coffee flavors.

**Cons**:

* **Pricey**: Burr grinders are a bit bougie. A decent one will set you back anywhere from $100 to several hundred dollars. But hey, can you really put a price on perfectly extracted coffee? (Answer: Yes, and it’s usually listed on Amazon.)
* **Bulky**: These bad boys are larger and heavier than blade grinders. Think “centerpiece of the kitchen counter” rather than “stows easily in a drawer.” But it’s a small price to pay for coffee greatness.

# The Decision: Which Grinder is Right for You?

Let’s break it down with a helpful analogy. If you’re just dipping your toe into the world of specialty coffee and think “notes” are things you pass to your crush in class, a **blade grinder** might be a good start. It's affordable, it's quick, and it'll get the job done... sort of. Think of it as the fast food of coffee grinders: convenient, but not gourmet.

But if you’re serious about getting the most out of your Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (the one with the tasting notes that sound like a dessert menu), you need a **burr grinder**. Think of it as a five-star chef preparing your beans for their flavor destiny. It’s an investment in your coffee future—and your taste buds will thank you.

# Conclusion: Why Choose Chaos When You Can Have Consistency?

In the coffee world, precision reigns supreme. Your beans have traveled far and wide, from tropical highlands to your kitchen counter. Treat them right.

**Verdict**: Burr grinder for the win, unless you’re into coffee roulette!",1,1729628927.0,Coffee_Vibes,0,1.0,False

They have never visited where we live, until this year they have come to visit us twice. This is great as I love my in laws, however they have stayed with us in our tiny apartment both times for 4 nights each time. We have one bedroom and a small open plan kitchen/living area with only enough seating for 3 people. So when all 4 of us are here people having to sleep in the living room and sit on the floor when we are all awake and hanging out. 

I get really irritated and tense when they are here because I’m very much an introvert and my space is important to me, even though they say how appreciative they are that we let them stay and that they will be accommodating and work around our schedule. We are still working while they are here and my routine gets disrupted, for example I had a wfh day but I couldn’t wfh because they were still in the living room/kitchen having breakfast and coffee when I usually work from the living room (I told them I wfh that day).

I know they are family, and I’m grateful they are here, I just feel like 4 days is a lot.

I don't want to miss anything so... Assuming I get 4 - 8 of each I would need... What? 


My current list. 

1. Wine

2. Brandy 

3. Whiskey 

4. English beer

5. American beer. (Tallboys) 

6. German beer (stiens) 

7. Champaign

8. Tea cups (probably best to leave as porcelain)

9. Coffee cups (probably best to leave as porcelain) 

10... Basic water, soda, juice or milk cups? Possibly best to leave these as glass???


... Once I knock this out I want to swap out plates and curlery for silver and China. Though I do want to keep some ceramics with steel cutlery for casual dinners

How much silver is a weird ammount? ",2,1729628339.0,Gentleman,4,1.0,False
1g9rywb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9rywb/starbucks_shares_slide_after_preliminary_results/,Starbucks shares slide after preliminary results show sales fell again,"Starbucks on Tuesday posted preliminary quarterly results, which showed its sales fell again.

Nearly two months ago, CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the coffee giant after two quarters of same-store sales declines.

He aims to reverse slowing demand for Starbucks’ drinks, particularly in its two largest markets: the United States and China. In the U.S., the chain has been losing its occasional customers, who have opted to save money instead of spending on its macchiatos and Refreshers. Starbucks’ business in China has also been struggling to recover ever since the pandemic, and the rise of cheaper local rivals like Luckin Coffee and a more cautious consumer have dented sales in recent months.

Niccol joined Starbucks after six years as CEO of Chipotle; during his tenure at the fast-casual chain, he led the company through a turnaround after its foodborne illness crises, invested in its digital business and turned it into a top industry performer, even during the pandemic.

To curb Starbucks’ sales slump, Niccol plans to turn first to the company’s struggling U.S. business. In an open letter released during his first week on the job, he said he plans to focus on four areas of improvement: the barista experience, morning service, its cafes and the company’s branding.

Niccol has also been reshuffling the company’s executive ranks. On Friday, the company announced a former Chipotle executive, Tressie Lieberman, will be joining Starbucks as its global chief brand officer, a newly created position. And last month, Starbucks said its North American CEO Michael Conway would retire after just five months in the role; Niccol’s predecessor Laxman Narasimhan had appointed Conway before his ouster in August.

Shares of Starbucks are up 1% this year, as of Tuesday’s close. The company has a market cap of more than $109 billion.

The company is expected to report its fiscal-fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Oct. 30.

1g9ryco,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1g9ryco/should_i_just_forget_about_it/,Should I just forget about it. ,"So 2 years ago I (f42) changed my car and got a loan to buy it and had another car to sell. I bought cash dale and planned to sell my old car to pay back the finance. Loan was for £4000 coding £5000 and my car was valued at £5500 so I wasn’t too bothered. 

At the same time my brother got into difficulties with his car and couldn’t afford to fix it. Was gonna cost more than it was worth and he owed about £3000 on it. Now I OFFERED to sell him my car. He could pay me back £20 a week until the finance was paid and because I needed the loan I’ll take the hit on the interest. So about 3 months into this my brother without speaking to me sold the car to his step son. Stepson hates me and I honestly don’t know why. Anyway I didn’t want this done as I felt step son wouldn’t pay for car. I told him that it wasn’t his car to sell and I wanted it back. Nope he’d sold it on it was his right. Now it wasn’t his right as the tax book was in my name and we had an agreement in text message. Family told me I had to do it so I agreed that I wasn’t paying anymore and stepson would pay me £108 a month via direct debit. Nope that never happened. After months of fighting and begging for the car back but eventually getting drip paid the funds he agreed to £100 per month. Then it was a fight to get that. I wouldn’t get it for a week and was called every name under the son for asking for the money. At the time I was getting disability as I wasn’t fit to work and was paying the finance every month weather he gave me the money or not. After a big argument he told me he was gonna sell the car and I could eff off. All via text and I pointed out how much he still owed me and the car remained my property until it was paid. All in all I think I was paid about £1700 when I got a message to tell me that neither my brother or his step son were gonna pay me that I got enough. Big fight I threatened them with solicitors and police and was forced by threat that I had to except £800 at £20 a week paid over the next year. What choice had I. The last time I went to the police about one of my brothers assaulting me I was accused of wrecking my family. 

So he was supposed to give me £20 yesterday and I never got it so I sent a request in Revolut to get a message back stating I’ll get the money when I get it. I just replied that’s not the deal and he knows it. 

Next thing he land at my mums where I am and I just started. I told him I’d had enough and I just wanted the money he agreed to. He then said that he couldn’t afford it and he’d give me £40 next week. To be told I was lucky to be getting anything. 

My mother is ill and we always fight over their treatment of me. On brother(m50) went through my drawers in my mums house looking for the security camera hard drive the. I had to call the police after he had me pinned to the wall screaming I’m not a pervert. I threw a coffee jar at him and he started videoing me saying he was gonna do me for assault. So I went to the police told them what I donr and they ended up going to speak to him. So I’ve no support from anyone else in the family because I went to the police. 

Should I just forget about the money for my own peace of mind because I’m not willing to go the legal route. All agreements are in text message where both agree to pay for the car. A log book was fraudulently obtained as I have the original here as I didn’t want to sign over the book until I was paid. 

I’m at my wits end over the whole thing. 

I now know about not loaning money to family and yes I feel stupid. ",1,1729628275.0,family,2,1.0,False

I have already have played several so I wondered if anyone has any new suggestions on my preferences/what I have played so far:

Games I have played already and really enjoyed:

-Chefs Life (highly doubtful but if you have a suggestion close to this I would LOVE it lol)
-Travellers Rest
-Tavern Keeper
-CSD 1 & 2
-Older cooking mama games
-Good Pizza Great Pizza
-Flipline cooking games

Games I have played but didnt really care for:

-Cooking Simulator
-Cat Cafe
-Kairosoft games
-Bear and Breakfast
-Dave the Diver
-Lemon Cake
-Bakery Simulator
-Espresso Tycoon
-Coffee Caravan

If you can provide any suggestions I would be more than happy to hear, but I feel like I mentioned them all xD Also, the games should preferably be singleplayer or the ability to be played solo. I want a game with the main focus of cooking, not just an aspect like Stardew Valley or Portia (still loved both regardless). Thanks!!!
