I'm hesitating on buying a brand new P line, my first ever Brompton. I have tested it, and have to admit that the small form factor is odd at first, I guess I'll just have to get used to it.

My main concern is this: say you wanna go to the library to study a bit, with a regular bike you would attach it outside and job done.
With a brompton, you would ? carry it inside ? maybe try to put it in a locker but maybe it doesnt fit ? maybe the library doesnt allow folding bikes ? then you would leave it next to you while studying, but if you decide to go get coffee then someone might steal it ?

Am I overthinking this ? I feel like a brompton would be more of a burden no ?",1,1728735353.0,Brompton,0,1.0,False

1g1ysco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1g1ysco/2_years_reality_of_female_attraction/,2+ Years : Reality of Female Attraction,"Female attraction is the most interesting aspect of SR, but also the least significant. 

Do girls get attracted to you just because you are on semen retention? No   
You can be on SR and still come off as a jerk - this has nothing to do with your practice

  
As a by product of SR, if you tend to grow into an individual who starts taking responsibility for himself - health, knowledge, finances, career, self education, and become an empathetic soul by taking responsibility for the well being of your family, close ones, and spend time following your passion, you are of course going to attract good people into your life. 

  
Yes, I have had beautiful relations and equations with the females in my life. And it did get better after being on SR. But the reason was not SR, but the identity shift and lifestyle change that came along with SR. 

When you adopt this practice in an attempt to become a man of use to the society, spend time finding your purpose in life, and being helpful to the people around you, automatically you will be attractive to girls. 

I can comfortably go for coffee and tea with my female friends, and allow them to safely discuss what is going on in their life. I can confidently share to them about my life, my relationship, and everything else. Some of my best friends are girls. I got into my first relationship, and that has been a beautiful experience too. 

But there was a phase (the first year) where I just had acquaintances in the name of female friends. And that never bothered me or made me desire for more female interaction. I was busy getting my health in order, reading and writing stuff, following my passion, and engaging in college activity.  When you are on SR, and start taking your health seriously by lifting weights and eating clean, you are automatically going to be perceived as physically attractive. Not a greek god, but good enough. Beyond this, if you are engaging yourself in meaningful pursuits, you are going to have good people walk into your life. 

>  
Concluding thoughts : SR is not a manipulative hack that will put you in a cruise with dozens of women swooning for you. SR combined with taking responsibility for yourself and adding net positive value to the society, can signal to the universe that you are a man of high value and the female energy would feel safe and comfortable around you. 

If female attraction is the sole reason for SR, you are more likely to fail. If you are doing this to find your place in the world, then SR might be the right step in that very direction. Spread love!

The FILTER SIZE LED was flashing in the beginning of the week, so I cleaned the Burr grinder. That fixed the problem, but only briefly. I called support, who said it might be something with the top cover and the bean hoppers connection. So I ordered and installed a new top cover - but to no effect. 

Now I’ve cleaned the burr grinder again. Afterwards, it grinds 1 portions of coffee and then returns to the flashing LED-lights of doom. The grinder sounds… tired…? And I have no idea how to fix this. 

Has anyone else had similar problems or do you have any recommendations for fixes? 

Machine is 2,5 years old so no warranty.

I was always more sensitive to it than other people I know, so I guess a lot of it comes down to genetics.

I have come to a point where if I drink half of an espresso shot, I will get so jittery, making me feel that it is just not worth it. I would explain the feeling as having intense adrenaline rushes. Even in periods of my life where my stress levels were a lot higher, caffeine would not affect me this much.

I feel like just comparing one year back, I have gotten even more sensitive to caffeine. I often would take one week breaks of any caffeine, but when I come back and drink just a half of a coffee, the problem does not seem to improve. I am in my late 20s by the way.

1g1ykqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1g1ykqn/why_not_moka_pot/,Why not moka pot,"It rhymes you see?

I see multiple posts on here (I could say with increasing frequency, but I shan't) where people want to buy espresso machines (sometimes they say coffee machine but I think they want an espresso machine). The condition always is they want a cheap one. 
Now I have never seriously looked into the matter but I understand that anything cheaper than a gaggia classic is not worth the money spent. Personally I would want to buy a Sylvia. 
In any case we understand that they don't come cheap. 

My question is. Why not just get a moka pot?
It doesn't do espresso? Ok. But are you really going to feel the difference? It doesn't extract at 9 bar but it does extract using a similar technique. It uses less coffee than an espresso machine would but also uses less coffee (beans) than pour over or French press would. With the right conditions you would get a drink that is comparable to an espresso. 
For a price that is ten times (if you buy non bialetti then even cheaper) less and without all the hassle of maintaining the machine. A moka pot asks you to rinse it. Not even wash. A gentle scrub under running water is all it takes. 
And the coffee is delicious. You can make a decent cappuccino with it. 

In any case if you are not going to spend tens of thousands of rupees (lakhs even) on a machine and a decent grinder (which is more essential than the damn machine itself) how do you justify spending lots of money on buying expensive coffee (which given your shady equipment choices is likely getting wasted). The costs keep adding up. 
Is it aesthetics? Fetish? What? 
I would love to hear different perspectives on this. 

I want to state clearly 
1. I am not saying moka can do espresso. It cannot. I am saying for the price it's a good compromise. Especially because, in essence, the method is the same. You extract using pressure. 
2. I am merely curious. I am not doing this for research not do I mean to be judgemental. I would like to know. ",3,1728734481.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

When I saw the address i immediately started looking on my journey on how to come back home because where I live trains end 12:30 am and so does the bus time. Usually when I go out to some places I can take night buses and then a final bus home but it takes me hours because I am financially not able to get a cab.
 
I asked her weeks before if they were driving there as they have a car so I could ask f it's possible to drop me home as they live around me. She said they were taking public transport but we would figure it out. 

I said I'm not sure I'm able to come as I can't afford taking a cab home at the moment. 

AND I ALSO haven't spoken to her in years. Once a while I would respon to a snap story like 'this is cool and looks good.' But we don't talk so I'm surprised. 

I usually don't go out when I'm invited but say I would come but cancel last minute because I get anxiety so I just couldn't. But yesterday I was looking at how to get back home if I did show and told her I was looking at the journey.

 If I could come I will and if I can't I'll stay shortly. But on my way home I realised it wouldn't be fun to bother going at all. I went home and I actually did fall asleep after a long day at work until 10:30pm. 

She messaged me asking where I was and I told her I fell asleep after work because I was exhausted. I had plans to go to a nerd game near me to play mtg instead of going out for one hour and heading back home. 
This morning she responded and said they was plenty of free cares that could have taken me home.

I said she didn't tell me that. 
One; I wouldn't know the person and I needed to feel safe. If she was in that car I would feel safer. 

And she said 'I literally said we will figure it out.' I told her I needed confirmation before I left my house. I have been to a friends bday party before and when I wanted to leave she told me we would figure out how to get home that I should stay till the end so I did. 

When time came I was asking her and she was so drunk and said I should get a Uber. I'm used to friends confirming I'll drop you home because I don't wanna go out with no money. I'm broke and saving.

 That friends entire friend GANGED UP ON ME saying I shouldn't have assumed I would be driven I home and I shouldn't come out to party if I had no money. I was like damn... y'all are right. I came to show support but I'm attacked for assuming.

So I told her that situation. And plus I can't afford a cab. I didn't want to feel bad for not going because I've not spoken to her in year, she don't message or call to say hey how are you. Let's go have coffee to catch up.

 I did feel bad this morning but I couldn't dwell on it. So aita for not going last minute? ",1,1728734465.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

The problem is when it starts working I always go through a period of multiple hours before I actually get out of bed or off the coach and start my day. It really sucks because once I get working on something the meds make it so much easier to focus. But when the meds start working it's like I get this dread or anxiety about \*starting\*, I always feel like I'm going to be nauseous if I start up and get moving. Idk why.

After 4 hours or so I'm fine again and then I have the rest of the day to be productive on the meds but I hate this chunk of the morning and early afternoon that's wasted on this.

I MAY have been able to get one sooner but I was only interested in the XSE or XSE Premium and three colors. I may have seen one out and about in the last few years.  They are non existent here or maybe just around me. They offered me a red one two months ago which was not on my list and I said no, too flashy for me.  Anways, should be here in December.  I was not able to get the solar charging roof but looks to me like it has just about everything else on it.  Anyways again, I read a post from a few days and still am not finding the answer they mention that should be able to found in the subreddit.  I have no social media, maybe I don't know what I'm doing.  At any rate, I was going to get the Toyota charger and an EV guy told me that was absolutely crazy to spend $1250 and I just get the Tesla Universal charger because it will work on this car and any EV after 2025.  So do I need an adapter? I'm guess I'm confused it he meant it will work as is or if I need an adapter.  It looks like the 2023 models and below have a Toyota charger you can get for around $850 and 2024 and above is the $1250 model making me think maybe it changed?  I've never had an EV or I guess you would say a PHEV but am a major Toyota fan, and could not be more excited. But I don't know what I don't know. In all honesty my partner and I have shared one vehicle now for two years. He has a 4 mi round trip and goes in 4 days a week and I have a 10 mi round trip and I go in twice a week. As is, we get gas every two weeks and don't actually need to get it when we do.  I probably don't even need anything outside of the standard household outlet to charge but I would assume it would be better for the car?  My cousin is an electrician so he won't hurt me on labor.  Spending this much I may as well get the better charger?  Sorry, I am high energy, I just had my one cup of decaf coffee.  ",1,1728733864.0,PriusPrime,1,1.0,False

Apparently reflux can even get up into the sinuses and the enzyme pepsin can get activated triggering inflammation / problems. One solution is to eat a low acidic diet (PH6 higher and other factors) and cultivate practices that lower reflux (not lieing down for 3 hours after eating, elevating bed posts when sleeping, not overeating, no coffee, etc).

I'm beginning to try this, anyone else give it a try?

I live with my husband we are 23 and 24 im expecting currently 6 weeks which is the furthest into any pregnancy ive gotten (5ths time a charm i guess).

The younger one comes over 3 times a week as he isnt in school and my mother baby sits him. Hes used to being in ny house. I recently got a coffee table. Its infront of my sofa but if i have forewarning i move it out the way so that noone can hurt themselves after the first time he bumped himself. He got a shock and had a biscuit and was over it 3 seconds after. It was fine. Today i didnt get a chance to move it. Everyone walked straight into my lvijng room without even saying hello. Little monkey needed his nappy changed which they did on my sofa without a changing mat without asking so now my sofas got wee on it. Then he stood up and bumped his head. This was my fault so my sister dragged them home. My mother stayed and tried giving me a lecture on how i should never have bought a coffee table, how its too big to sharp to whatever i dont even know. My mother doesnt like coffee tables she considets them clutter thats the real issue here. I said, ""its not my responsibility to make sure a child that isnt mine and im not near is okay"". So i got bollocked and told to never have children. She has always been like this and shes cruel and favours her eldest grandson above all others.

1g1yd5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1g1yd5s/residential_vs_commercial_use/,Residential vs commercial use. ,"Hello all, 

I’m finding through more than one machine(Jura, DeLonghi) that I seem to be going through filters at an accelerated rate. I returned the 2 delonghi because the filter lasted 3 weeks. And the Jura just told me that I needed to replace the filter and upon further reflection it’s a 50liter filter. 

This machine is for a house of 3.

7 cups of coffee between us, 365ish days a year is the rule. This is 2555. Add a couple hundred to be safe for holidays, guests, and the occasional mid day coffee/affogato, and or an extra morning cup. And now I’m at 2855 cups of coffee a year minimally. Do I need to be looking at more of a commercial/high end machine. Based on this it seems instead of Keurig being unreliable(which it is anyway) I may actually be killing the coffee maker due to use. Is my train of thought a sound one?

What super automatic coffee machines would you all recommend? While I preferred the Delonghi D+ coffee over the Jura S8. They both brewed significantly better cups than the Keurig. We drink only black coffee and an espresso for the affogato. I do not want a traditional carafe machine because 2 of the 3 do not want to deal with waiting for the machine to brew more coffee. I’m not really into it either, and the best one won’t fit under the cabinet. 

Budget: I’m interested in finding out what the Budget, mid, high, premium. That being said, I originally wanted to stay around 1000-2000(absolutely top) I’m finding I may have to go a little higher. I still may not. But I’d like to know what’s out there for this use case.

I have one more example of what I am looking for, but it's sadly not an anime, but it illustrates the point well.

It's a book by the Japanese author Toshikazu Kawaguchi called ""Before the Coffee Gets Cold"".

Here's a quick explanation:

An urban legend is circulating about a certain seat in a certain town’s coffee shop. If you use that seat, rumor has it you will be transported back to a time of your choice.

 And the rules are:

1. You can only meet people who have visited the coffee shop.  
2. No matter what you do, you can’t change the present.  
3. A customer will be sitting in your seat in the past. You have to wait until they’ve gone to sit down.  
4. You can’t change seats.  
5. Your time in the past starts when your coffee has been poured and ends once the coffee has gone cold. 

Those aren’t the only rules, but you get the point. Please recommend me some good anime based on rules! Thanks!!:D",2,1728733531.0,anime,4,1.0,False
1g1yaph,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1g1yaph/in_a_rut/,In a rut ,"Hello all, just wanted to share with the hope that some can relate, and perhaps provide some helpful advice. 

I am in a great place professionally at the moment, with a lot of demands on my time, deadlines, and multiple projects. I'm very happy about this and worked hard to get here. I am also now totally self employed running a business and doing various other side things so my schedule is largely my own, deadlines aside. This is, in theory, dreamy for my PDA and tendency to get overstimulated and burned out. It feels really good to be successful in my career after struggling a lot in my thirties. I'm also in a new country that I love and am excited to be starting out here. 

BUT...I'm in a rut in my social and domestic life, and have fallen into some bad habits. My apartment is a disaster zone - it's constantly cluttered and messy and it's getting to me. I keep ordering doordash instead of cooking or even making my own coffee purely because I feel too overwhelmed, or don't have groceries, or haven't done the dishes. I stopped exercising and have put on 10lbs in a short space of time. I often avoid socialising and am finding it hard to make plans and keep up with important family and friend communications. I have a workspace I rent (that I love) a few blocks away but I often end up working from home in my PJs instead. For years I worked in corporate and education environments where I had to be out of the house a lot and I found it so overwhelming but now I feel like I have gone too far the other direction. I feel like I get hyper-focussed on work and on my (solo) hobbies and struggle to switch tasks in order to get anything else (cleaning, admin, socialising, texting people back) done.

1g1y98v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1g1y98v/honest_dialogue/,Honest dialogue,"Hey, I hope you're well. I'd like to talk about what's going on between us because I feel like there are unspoken things that weigh on me and leave me with a series of questions that I don't have clear answers to. I think it's important for me to clarify some things, to understand where I stand in your life and what your intentions are for me.

I want to ask you directly: what do I mean to you? As a person, without considering other contexts. I want to know if you see me simply as a friend, or if in your eyes I am more special than the rest. I feel like I need to understand this in order to better navigate our relationship and know how to relate to you.

I'm asking you these things because I don't understand why the idea of ​​physical intimacy would arise between us, when it seems like I'm just a friend to you. If, in fact, your goal was just to reach some level of physical intimacy from the beginning, it would be much easier for me to know that now so that I don't live in uncertainty. Your honesty would make things clearer for me and give me a chance to make the right decisions for myself without setting unrealistic expectations.

You realize I can't read your mind, I don't know what you're thinking or what you expect from me, and that's why I prefer to have this open and honest discussion. Maybe you also have uncertainties about me, so I want us to put all our questions on the table, without reservations.

You told me we were friends and I tried to act accordingly. But if we remain in this position, why is the idea of ​​sex brought up? For me, physical intimacy isn't just a casual affair between two friends, it involves a different kind of connection and a different level of communication. If for you it is normal for two friends to have a physical relationship and then carry on as if nothing happened, I want you to know that for me this is completely foreign and incompatible with my values ​​and principles.

I don't want to claim that I'm always right or that my values ​​are the only correct ones, but I strongly believe that we need to respect each other's points of view. If such behavior is acceptable to you, then I prefer to step back and keep our distance, because I want to stay true to my principles.

We both know that we had a history together, with good and bad, with beautiful moments but also with difficulties. But that's why we call it the past—because that's where it should stay. I think it's important to live in the present and make decisions that reflect who we are now and what we want from life. If we use the past as a justification for doing certain things in the present, it seems to me that we bind ourselves in a vicious circle that does not allow us to evolve.

And yes, I don't want to ignore the fact that maybe I've done wrong to you, maybe I've said things that hurt you or put you in uncomfortable situations, and for that I sincerely apologize. I have not always been aware of the impact of my words and actions, but if I have contributed to your pain or confusion, I am truly sorry.

I'd also appreciate an ""I'm sorry"" from you too if you feel you've gone wrong somewhere. I think it's a gesture of respect and an important step in any relationship, be it friendship or otherwise. I'm not asking this to put you in a corner, but because sometimes I feel that such simple gestures are needed to build a common ground of understanding.

I admit that somewhere in me there are remnants of feelings for you, but they are not feelings that overwhelm me or prevent me from living my daily life. I've learned to manage and understand them better, and I know they only come to the surface when I'm feeling vulnerable, like when I wrote to you under the influence of alcohol and you told me you had someone else. I regret that moment, but I am aware that what was, was.

Now, however, I want to clear things up between us. If we are friends, then let's be friends and respect the boundaries of this relationship. We can go out for a coffee, a beer, to enjoy each other's company, but without going beyond those limits.

Still, I can't ignore the fact that I'm getting mixed messages from you, signals that make me wonder if you, too, have unresolved feelings for me. If you feel that there is something more to say from your side or that there is something still unresolved, please let me know so that we can discuss it openly and not live in this ambiguity.

I want you to know that I'm not looking for a relationship right now, I don't feel the need to have someone by my side. However, I am open to honest discussions, without expectations and without pressure. If you feel that you cannot respect my boundaries and values, then I will step back, without resentment. This is not a threat, but a mature decision to protect my peace.

I don't wish you harm, it would be stupid to have such a mentality towards someone I cared about and care about. On the contrary, I want to see you happy and fulfilled in your life, achieve your goals and enjoy every step forward you take. If there is anything I can support you in, I will, even if my support may seem small and insignificant.

I understand that maybe you don't understand me fully or maybe you don't even want to, but I want to understand you. I would like to know how you see things, so that I know how to approach this situation. Please think about what I told you and try to find a solution that will help us both, stop going around in circles and make it easier for us to get past these uncertainties.

I want you to be honest with me, without fear. You know I won't judge you no matter what you say. I will respect your perspective and adjust based on what I hear from you. I look forward to your response, whatever it may be.",1,1728733275.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

DECEMBER 1-7

After driving Jules and Bonnie to the airport, lugging all their luggage through the various gates, my chastity device poking me the whole time as I watched all these women in their hot yoga pants getting ready to travel. Bonnie and Jules were quite the couple. She wore her yoga pants with pride and no undies along with a braless top that allowed her nipples to poke through the fabric. Once their luggage was all moved from the car and checked, Bonnie gave me a peck on the cheek and told me to be good and they’d see me the day after Christmas. I stood there transfixed as I watched my beautiful wife and her Bull walk out of my life for the next three weeks and into their own romantic, sexual bliss. My groin ached. My only hope was that either Jules or Bonnie would allow me some release while they were gone. You see, my chastity device is made of a very light alloy and is equipped with a locking mechanism which can be unlocked with a key or from an app on a phone. Should they decide to think of me and want to allow me some pleasure, they could unlock me from far away.

I drove home and felt lonely and alone for the first time in a very long time. As I said I hate Christmas and the holidays surrounding it. I tried to get myself in a good mood, knowing that I would be able to watch whatever shows I wanted on which I cannot do when they are home. I also knew it meant I would be able to sleep late on the weekends which usually held a six-a.m. alarm for me so I could be up and ready to serve them breakfast in bed whenever they awoke. And while I was waiting, I would do laundry and my chores. I thought back to growing up and how I hated having to do my siblings chores. I had come to realize and accept my station in life as a beta, submissive, subservient male who was put on this earth to serve and please others. As I thought of this, my tiny clitty began to tingle and the spikes inside reminded me even further what my station in life was. 

As I pulled into the driveway, I saw a strange car there and immediately got worried. The door was open, and I thought of calling the police as I am not the type to confront an intruder. But I didn’t think someone would drive a car right into the driveway and break in. I entered slowly and mouth fell open when I spotted Mona lying on the couch watching a movie.

“About time you got here.” She said, grabbing a handful of popcorn. “I had to pop my own popcorn!”

“M-m-m-ona, w-w-w-hat are you doing here?” I stammered.

“What am I doing here? You think Bonnie and Jules are going to go away for three weeks and leave you alone? No way sister! I told them you needed supervision. I’m going to be staying here and supervising you. I’ll expect absolute obedience, or I’ll be taking the switch to you.” My face blushed and she laughed. “Oh, that’s right, I know they whip your ass if you get out of line. Well, hopefully we won’t have any of that. Now get over here and give me one of those famous foot massages of yours that I hear Bonnie bragging about all the time.” 

I was in hell. I knew it. Mona wiggled her fat foot in front of me and I made my way through a sea of spilled popcorn on the rug and empty soda cans to kneel by her feet. I began her foot massage, and she stopped me and told me to kiss them first and then massage them. I complied, her feet stunk of sweat and dirt, but I did as commanded. After about ten minutes she spoke again.

“Take off your clothes. I want you naked around the house from now on.” Embarrassed, and emasculated and humiliated I knew better than to resist and rose and stripped off my clothes. “Turn around, do a little pirouette for me.” I turned as if a ballerina and she laughed. “Well, I don’t know what the hell my daughter ever saw in you except a big bank account. You’ve got no hair anywhere on your body including your head. You’re fat. And look at that tiny clit all locked up! Oh, by the way, I have the app on my phone and Bonnie and Jules have given me exclusive control of your chastity device. So, if you want to have any kind of release these next few weeks, you better work extra hard to please me. Now, back to my feet.”

I had come to accept and appreciate the routine of Jules and Bonnie. Both had specific needs, and the house had certain rules and once I had come accustomed to them, there was a routine, but that wasn’t the case with Mona. She was like a manic-depressive with bi-polar disorder. She was up one minute, down the next. She would wake me up at three in the morning to clean her closet because she thought there was dust in there. She was sleeping in the spare room as the Master suite was reserved for Bonnie and Jules even though they weren’t there. The spare room was huge and had a big walk-in closet. I was required to remove all her clothes and shoes and sweep, vacuum and dust the walls. Of course, half-way through everything Mona would decide she was tired and wanted to go back to bed and tell me I had to finish in the morning. 

Luckily, I had taken my vacation from work the same time as Bonnie and Jules would be away, but I quickly realized there would be vacation for me. Mona kept me running from morning till night. Some nights I didn’t get to bed until four or five in the morning and she would wake me up at seven because she couldn’t figure out how the remote worked. She had a FaceTime call with Bonnie and Jules to show them I was in good hands, naked and doing my duties. I almost cried when I saw them on board the cruise ship, Bonnie in a very revealing sun dress her big tits almost falling out the top and her thunderous thighs on display with a bunch of guys in the background staring at her. Jules in his designer bathing suit and no shirt showing off his coal black physique and huge bulge made me want to be there so bad. Mona had taken to carrying a switch which she had found in a secondhand store around the house with her. It was a riding crop, and she wasted no time using it if she thought I wasn’t moving fast enough or doing a good enough job. As the call ended, she taunted me more.

“They look like they’re having a great time! Bet you wish you were there instead of here with your old mother-in-law huh?” I knew I had to walk this answer carefully off my tongue. If I said yes I wished I was with them, she’d beat me for not wanting to be with her, if I said no I wanted to be with her instead of them she’d beat me for disrespecting her daughter.

“I’m just happy to be serving Bonnie and her family in any capacity I can and making everyone happy.”

She grabbed my nipple and pulled me to her. “That was a pretty politically correct answer. You think I’m stupid?”

“No Mona, it’s how I really feel.” She tweaked my nipple harder causing me to cry out in pain.

“And stop with the Mona shit. From now on you call me Ma’am, understand?”

“Yes Ma’am.” 

Midweek she left the house and didn’t tell me where she was going. It was late in the afternoon, and she didn’t return until late that night when I heard the car pull into the driveway. I heard laughing and Mona’s loud voice. The door swung open and in walked Mona, her hair mussed, her lipstick smeared, her blouse unbuttoned almost to her navel revealing she was wearing no bra, and her skirt was pulled up exposing her big tan thighs. She was drunk and led a guy into the living room by the hand. 

“See! I told ya! Our own personal sex slave!” She flopped on the couch and pulled the stud down next to her. I stood there embarrassed and shivering at being naked in front of them. Before long, they were both naked and Mona was stroking his massive but soft cock. 

“Suck this and get it hard for me. I wanna get fucked. You don’t mind him sucking your cock do ya Tim?” She said, laughing.

“Oh, I don’t mind, a warm mouth is a warm mouth as long as I’m gonna get to fuck that wet pussy of yours.” 

I knelt and took his cock in my mouth and sucked. Before long he was rock hard and must have measured at least eight inches. Mona pushed me out of the way and straddled him on the couch her pussy making his cock disappear inside her as she impaled herself on his rigid staff. I must admit for an older woman, Mona was not bad to look at naked, she was what people would call a MILF or (Mother I’d Like To Fuck) and she rode Tim’s cock fast and hard. Finally, she dismounted and dragged him into the bedroom, and I could hear her yelling and screaming. I couldn’t imagine what Bonnie and Jules would think of her having a stranger in our home, but I accepted it and meekly sat in the living room. Soon I heard Mona yelling that she was gonna cum and for Tim to cum inside her. Then she yelled for me to get in there. I entered the bedroom just as Tim rolled off her and she told me to clean them up. I obediently went between her legs and began licking their juices up which eventually led to her having another orgasm. Then, I took Tim’s semi-rigid shaft in my mouth and cleaned him. At last, I heard them both snoring and I turned off the light and left them be.

The next morning Tim appeared in the kitchen while I was making coffee. Mona was still zonked out and I made him breakfast and we talked.

“You guys really get into this shit huh?” Tim said.

“Well, my wife and I have a different relationship. I’m a bit underendowed and she has someone to fulfill her needs that I can’t. But they are away on vacation for the holidays, and I didn’t know her mom would be staying until the other day.”

“Well, she’s one crazy fuck that Mona. Listen buddy, I appreciate the breakfast and the blowjob last night, but I gotta get going and get to work. You take care.” And with that, he was gone and I had to deal with a hungover Mona.

WEEK ONE  
NOVEMBER 24-30

“Don’t forget my ski-boots, and that pink jumper that Jules likes. Oh, and don’t forget Jules’ sweaters it might be cold up there, but I’m sure we’ll keep warm!” Bonnie yelled from the bedroom which used to be ours but was now occupied by her and her lover Jules. 

“Yes dear.” Knowing they weren’t even leaving for their Christmas vacation yet. It was only November twenty fifth and they were heading to Bonnie’s friend Stefani’s house to spend the week of Thanksgiving before going on a two-week cruise and then a romantic two-week skiing trip. My job was to do all the packing for them and to keep all the trips separate, so each trip had its own packing list. I had clothes and skiing equipment all over the garage where I had prepared a triage area for each trip. Of course, this meant moving the cot where I sleep and my Rubbermaid tub where I keep my clothes outside so I can fit all their stuff in here. Merry fucking Christmas I thought to myself.

I’ve always hated Christmas. Being an adopted child, I always got the worst birthday, and Christmas presents while the “real” kids got the best of everything. That also meant wearing my older brother’s hand me downs. Sometimes I think my adopted parents only adopted me to get the money from the state. I was treated less than human by them. I was made to sleep in a shed in the backyard with a mattress thrown on the floor and sack for a pillow and ripped woolen blanket. My meals were their leftovers if they remembered to feed me. I was also subject at times to severe punishment for failing to do “my chores” which were really my older siblings’ chores. 

The treatment by my family and my stature of an adopted child led me to become very shy and subservient to others. I had a typical beta personality and all through high schools the jocks and gear heads took full advantage of it, tormenting me and bullying me around as did the girls, always wanting me to do their homework and be an alibi for them when they were out dating their “real” boyfriends they’d tell their parents they were with me at the library and I of course would lie for them.  

After graduation I moved out, got an apartment, worked my ass off and invested very wisely. By the time I had hit my thirtieth birthday I had enough income from investments to last me the rest of my life. I continued to work however, because it gave me a purpose. The one thing I was missing in my life was a woman. And that’s when I met Bonnie.

I had always had an attraction to bigger women and when I spotted her for the first time I knew why. She was what was referred to as a BBW (Big Beautiful Woman) with black frizzy hair, and full lips, high cheekbones, massive thighs, and an ass to die for, her tits had to be at least a 44DD but she wore no bra and her nipples poked through the black fabric of her tight top making me hard instantly, she was round in curvy in all the right places. She wore lots of makeup and thick, long fake eyelashes and nails. She was what all the black guys referred to as a PAWG (Phat Ass White Girl) and she wore black leggings that accentuated her ass and full round thighs. She worked in the next office for some sports firm I had the pleasure of watching her walk into the office each morning and seeing what outfit she had on aroused me to no end. The black athletes who came into the office seemed to be very friendly with her, running their hands over her back and other places as they talked. One day at the coffee shop I worked up the nerve to ask her for a date and to my amazement she accepted. 

We dated for several months and Bonnie who loved to tease me to get whatever she wanted was the queen of getting her way. I had to confess to her about my inexperience with woman, lovemaking and sex. Bonnie of course, found it entertaining that I was a virgin and a rich one at that. She told me not to worry that she would handle my sex education. She began by letting me kiss her toes and feet and told me women especially love that. Then she had me graduate to kissing her thigs and pussy and instructed me in the art of cunnilingus giving me exacting instructions of what she like and how long she liked it. Then it was on to her asshole which she liked me to lick sometimes before and sometimes after I had licked her pussy. 

The first time she saw me naked she laughed and told me that I had a baby dick, and that it was the smallest she had ever seen. But instead of being ashamed, it made me hard when she made fun of it. She took a ruler and measured it after she had brought me to my full erectness. “Wow! Almost a full three inches, but not quite!” She laughed throwing the ruler on the bed and laying back and spreading her lips for me to lick her. After several orgasms I asked her about fucking her and she wiped her hand away in the air. “Oh honey, I could never even feel that tiny thing inside me. And I bet, if I let you put it inside me, you’d shoot in less than thirty seconds.”  I begged her to at least let me try to satisfy her and she acquiesced partially setting up the sexual ground rules of our relationship. She brought me towards her, took my tiny baby dick as she liked to call it, and rubbed it up and down on her pussy lips, I shuddered and exploded all over her.

“See? I knew you were a quick shooter. It’s okay though, we can find other ways to get you off, but right now clean me up.” I began to head for the bathroom to get a washcloth and she stopped me. “Honey, you have to learn to clean up your own messes and well sometimes you may have to clean up someone else’s mess too, but for now, be a good boy and clean me up with your tongue.” I had never tasted cum before but had seen plenty of women drink it down in porn movies, so I lowered my head and cleaned up my own cum.  

This became our ritual; I would buy Bonnie sexy lingerie and outfits, and she would model them for me and tease me and then have me lick her to several orgasms before her allowing me to play with her tits and jerk my cock off for several seconds and cum. Always ending in me licking my own cum off her tits. Bonnie became my teacher, my mentor in all things sexual. 

Our relationship grew and I proposed marriage and Bonnie accepted. Since I really had no family or friends to speak of, the guest list were all Bonnie’s friends and co-workers. She looked gorgeous in her white wedding dress and white thigh highs with her pale skin and black her it was quite the contrast. I’m not much of a dancer and as the reception went on and people had more and more to drink, they became very uninhibited. I sat alone at the head table while Bonnie danced with her girlfriends and other guests. One in particular was a very tall, coal-black man with a bald head and huge muscles. Bonnie seemed to pay particular attention to him, dancing and almost flirting with him. When a slow song came on the two dance as if THEY were husband and wife. My throat went dry as I spotted them coming towards the head table where I sat, his huge arm around my beautiful wife. 

“Honey, this is Jules! He’s a friend of mine. A retired football player. I got to know him working in the office. Jules, this is my little hubby!” The way she said ‘little hubby’ made me blush. I stood to shake the big man’s hand. He was at least 6’5” broad shouldered, huge chest, massive arms and legs. I reached out my hand.

“Pleased to meet you Sir,” I said, remembering one of Bonnie’s tutoring lessons that it was always the polite thing to do to call another man Sir. My tiny white hand disappeared inside his massive paw and as he squeezed it, I winced with pain. I know there were tears in my eyes from the pain but I tried not to show it. They both chuckled.

“Honey, Jules and I are going out for a breath of fresh air, it’s SO hot in here, can you take all the presents and load them into the car, so we don’t have to do it later? Thanks, love!” And just like that they were gone. 

“Yes dear,” I said, as they walked away, I’m sure not hearing me. 

As I loaded the presents in the car, I looked around for them outside but couldn’t see them anywhere. Later that night when we went upstairs to our bridal suite, I noticed the bed was a bit messy and when I told Bonnie I was going to complain she said no, that she had used the bed earlier as she had a headache and came up to rest for a bit. 

Bonnie dimmed the lights and looked at me in her half-drunken stupor and winked at me. Her face, heavily laden with makeup, her hair mussed from dancing, her tits half hanging out of the dress and her thighs showing from the slit in her wedding dress. “So, lover, you ready to consummate our marriage?” She dropped the dress to reveal her totally naked body except for the thigh highs and plopped back on the bed and spread her lips. Her hair was splayed on the pillow and those huge tits lay on either side of her the nipples erect. I dove onto the bed and began lapping furiously at her pussy. It seemed wetter than normal and tasted saltier. But I could tell I was pleasing her, so I didn’t stop to ask questions, I just licked like a madman. She pulled my bald head into her and fucked my face hard. I had never seen Bonnie drunk, and this was another side to her, but I was kind of enjoying it. I licked her pussy and ass for over an hour bringing her to numerous orgasms. Finally, she pushed me away and just passed out snoring. Slowly, I unrolled the thigh highs from each leg and smelled them and felt that all too familiar quiver in my nether regions telling me I had cum in my pants. 

The next morning at breakfast as Bonnie nursed a mimosa and black coffee attempting to cure her hangover, I asked her if she had enjoyed what I did for her last night.

“Oh honey, honestly most of it is a blur. I remember taking off my dress and laying down and that’s about it.” 

I recounted the hour-long licking session and numerous orgasms and decided to come clean about her thigh highs and me cumming in my pants. 

“Oh baby, that’s so sweet! And so hot! You got yourself off smelling my thigh highs. That turns me on. You know honey while we’re talking about sex and our life together, I wanted to discuss something with you.” She said it with all the air of a school principal discussing an issue with an errant student, and I sat up and listened attentively as she went on.

“You know honey, there is an old saying, ‘man cannot live by bread alone. Well women can’t live without a nice, big, hard cock to fuck them. Now I know this is a sensitive issue to discuss with you since you have your baby dick but we need to clear the air now. I love what you do for me. You cook and clean and do the laundry and yardwork and housework and I adore you for that. But the reality is, when you were born, God didn’t bless you down there like he did other men. Now, we could pretend that you’re hung, and you could try to fuck me, which we know you can’t, and I could pretend I’m having and orgasm and fake it which I don’t want to do, and I am sure you don’t want me to do. So, while you are so good and do so much for me in all those other departments, and you’re lacking in that one department I was thinking I need to have that big cock. Now hear me out. Let’s say you did all that stuff for me, and you weren’t good at landscaping and so we had to hire a landscaper. That wouldn’t be so difficult, would it? Hiring someone to perform a service and you and I wouldn’t think twice about it. But people get all mushy and judgmental when it comes to sex. Basically, what I’m saying honey is that we could invite a third person in to help in the area where you’re lacking, and we will ALL be happy.”

“You mean hire someone to have sex with you?” 

“No silly! Not hire someone!! I know someone already who will do it for free. You remember Jules who you met last night? Well Jules and I dated before I met you and I had sex with him, and he is HUGE!” She moved her two index fingers apart to about nine inches. “And THAT is soft. I’m getting off track here. What I’m saying is, I don’t want to have to cheat on you to get pleased and to get the thing you CANNOT give me no matter how hard you try, and you certainly don’t want me to cheat on you, so this way, everyone is on board, and everyone knows their place. Now if you’d prefer it the other way like my girlfriend Stefani who constantly cheats on Ken because he’s tiny too, I could do that, but I really don’t want to; so, it’s up to you.” 

I sat there, my throat parched, my head spinning, trying to process all she had just told while visions of her and Jules rolled through my mind. And all the while, my cock was throbbing, and a growing wet spot was spreading across my lap providing me with the answer.

“That’s a lot to process. And what you say does make sense about the cheating, I certainly wouldn’t want that. And I suppose in many ways it would be like hiring a landscaper or someone else to do something I’m unable to do for you. So, I guess it would be okay, but I’m not sure exactly how it would work.” I said, acting a bit confused.

“Well, first of all, there’s no guessing here. Either you want to do this or not. There is no halfway. You’re either committed to pleasing me and our marriage or you’re not. Secondly, it would work very simply; when I wanted to get fucked, I would call Jules and he would come over and fuck me.”

“Y-y-y-you mean at our house?” I stammered.

“Of course, at our house silly, I’m not going to spend money on a hotel when we have a perfectly good bed!”

“A-a-a-and would I be there?”

“Where else would you be? I need to have you there to clean up afterwards and I need that tongue of yours.”

I gulped and thought it over for a minute and realized it would be the only time I’d get to experience my beautiful wife having real sex, albeit not with me. “Well, then yes! Let’s do it!” I said. 

Thanksgiving week flew by. Initially it was just the two of them who were invited to Stefani’s for Thanksgiving dinner, but since our marriage had basically become a blueprint for a cuckold marriage, Stefani thought it would be a good idea for me to come along and perhaps she could impress on Ken they too needed a marriage like ours. 

I spent the week baking pies and desserts and getting everything ready to go while Jules, who had moved into our house and Bonnie lounged on the couch and watched movies and flipped through their cell phones. Thanksgiving morning I had the car all packed as they were going straight to the airport from Stefani’s and on their cruise. I was to stay at home, work and mind the house. Of course, I was footing the bill for the cruise, so no expense was spared; they had a balcony suite. 

Arriving at Stefani’s, I gingerly carried all my baking into the kitchen and set them on the counter. No one said hi to me except Ken who was in an apron doing dishes. After getting everything settled, I brought Jules a Hennessy and Bonnie a margarita. The other guests included Bonnie’s mother Mona who didn’t really liked me and always thought Bonnie could have done better. She was big, brassy, blonde; think of the actress Jennifer Coolidge with a bitchy side and that was Mona. Also in attendance was Stefani’s mother and father and Stefani’s older sister Brenda. As they all sat around and drank and talked, Ken and I prepared the dinner and did all the heavy work. Right before dinner was served Bonnie called me into the living room. Standing in front of everyone I felt awkward as it was having my wife’s lover there, but if that wasn’t enough there was more humiliation in store. 

“Okay everyone, quiet down! Now listen, the other day Jules and I were driving by the mall and they were having some Thanksgiving sale at a furniture store and they had these two guys dressed in turkey outfits with big signs and Jules thought it would be a riot if Ken and my hubby donned them and waved to people and wished them a Happy Thanksgiving outside on the sidewalk while we all ate.” 

My face turned crimson, and Ken slid back into the kitchen. I didn’t know what to say, this had to be a joke, but it wasn’t. Jules handed me two boxes and said, “I want you two to go put these on and come back and see us.” Everyone laughed and I immediately slipped into the kitchen. 

“Are they fucking crazy?” Ken said, in a very loud voice. 

“Shhh, keep your voice down! Listen, this is probably just a little joke. Or a test to see if we’ll go through with it. Now here, let’s humor them and put them on and I bet they won’t make us go outside, but if they do, so what? It’ s Thanksgiving and no one will be out, and it will be a joke.” 

“I don’t know what kind of marriage you and Bonnie have, but she keeps hinting how great it is and how she would like us to be more like you guys! Well, if this is what’s in store I want no part of it. And who’s that guy that’s with you? I know he was at your wedding and buddy let me tell you, he had his hands all over your wife! You need to be careful!”

I pulled both turkey outfits out of the box, handed one to him and told him to put it on and I’d explain once we were outside. After walking back into the living room with laughs, guffaws, and chortles from everyone, Jules stood and opened the door. “Now you two boys make sure we can see you waving and wishing people a Happy Thanksgiving as they drive by and he ushered us outside locked the door. 

I explained or attempted to explain to Ken all I could about our marriage, how Bonnie had convinced me to let Jules into our life and her rationale. I also explained to him about my inadequacy as a man and that instead of a threat, I had come to view Jules as an adjunct to our marriage. I used the landscaper analogy, but Ken didn’t seem too convinced. I asked if he would rather have Stefani cheating on him or if she were out in the open about things. He said the latter would be his preference.  I told him to make sure after we left tonight to sit and have a long and deep discussion with her about all of this. In the meantime, the crowd had gathered at the front window as Ken, and I waved and waved and yelled Happy Thanksgiving to people as they drove by. Yes, we looked ridiculous, and it was demeaning and emasculating but I looked at it like it was all in fun. I told Ken that; life is about making yourself believe whatever situation you’re in it’s all about fun. I told him how bad my childhood was and that was the device I used to escape from that, and I did that till this day. And so, we both agreed and began laughing and waving to people and pretending we were having fun. Once back inside the house, we saw a tiny little table with paper plates and plastic dishes like one set for little kids. Jules ushered us over to the table and told us to sit still in our turkey outfits and eat our Thanksgiving dinner and that is what we did. ",1,1728732416.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I female(21) have a friend Ivy(20) who met a girl May (19), online through an app where you can find friends locally. She doesn’t like going to these hangouts alone so often invites me so we can make friend for our group and because I am someone who likes to chat and can keep a conversation going. The girl we met online met up with us for coffee and we all had a ton of fun hanging out for the majority of the day. We all hung out 3 more times which is where May and I realised we have a lot in common Ivy doesn’t really have an interest in. Ivy also chose to leave early on 2 of those occasion so she could see her boyfriend (who she sees daily already) the problem there was she expected me to leave with her and not keep hanging out with May even though we had planned stuff altogether .  



Ivy had asked me a few times if I was messaging May privately which I denied because I hadn’t. I didn’t know why this would be a problem seeing as I have friend groups where we hang out together and individually including our group with hers and my boyfriend. 



The problem started when Ivy went to visit her boyfriend’s house in his home town which also happens to be where I am from. Ivy was hangout out with people who I’m friends with but I didn’t mind because I wasn’t there. I was texting May for the first time not in the group chat and she asked if she could come over due to having some problems she wanted to discuss that related to something we talked about previously. I thought not inviting Ivy wouldn’t be a problem seeing as she was a few hours south of us and wouldn’t be able to come. She found out and was mad I was texting May privately and has been cold to me ever since. Should I apologise for texting her back?  


Overall I want to know if I’m the asshole for hanging out with May when Ivy can’t come to group things and WIBTA if I hang out with May alone in the future?",8,1728732231.0,AITAH,5,0.91,False

Sigh,"Yesterday I had a wonderful doctors appt I posted about here. The activities I did were light yoga (like gentle yoga for fibro seated), made breakfast, had 1 cup of half caff coffee, drank a ton of water and half a gatorlyte, had all 6 of my meals and snacks, saw my neurologist for the first time, got a ride to my partner’s house (that was my planned pacing bc it’s a 40 min drive), rested in bed for 3 hours, went on a short date with my partner, got ready for bed and headed to bed.

Sometimes when I visit my partner I help with cleaning or do some dishes, and I didn’t. I knew that it could flare me and I did way more than usual. So I avoided it.

Last night the sore throat hit. One side of my nose stuffed up. Woke up achy and so tired despite sleeping better than usual. Still have the congestion. I’m annoyed. I said no to as much as I could, had a positive medical appt, and still crashed :(

Someone even invited me to a cute event today and I considered going but obv I can’t feeling like this. I know general pacing and to never exert further in PEM. But what else could I do differently? I’m nervous bc I have other medical appts coming up. I have a dietitian visit virtually next week and need to do notes for it. And in November I have a physical, to get labs, and I have to get a skin biopsy.

I can’t afford to use an app like Visible to pace. At the same time my dysautonomia symptoms don’t always show up via HR and HRV. My fibro can flare even when my HRV is good. I’ve also had good HRV in crashes.

TLDR: I’m trying so hard with pacing but may have hit PEM anyway. I’m sad and in pain. What could I do differently?",2,1728732177.0,cfs,6,1.0,False

What I did find was tons of comments getting downvoted and disagreed with that these murders were premeditated. They obviously were… but that is not the argument of their case. However, I do understand that there are several layers to this.

I just want to say one thing. Premeditated, guilty, etc or not. Imagine if you were 6 years old in Kindergarten/1st grade. Before you could even make decisions for yourself - and your care giver is making these horrific decisions for you. They’re teaching you that no matter what you decide, these horrible things will happen to you before you go to sleep. You don’t even know what is wrong and what is right yet. You’re groomed to think that you can never make a decision on your own without these horrific consequences. It becomes your “normal” because you don’t even know otherwise.

In a healthy environment, your care givers teach you what is wrong and what is right. They teach you how to make decisions and that the wrong decision may affect you poorly. You learn to wake up in the morning and decide if you want coffee or not, you decide what you want for breakfast, you decide to go to the gym, brush your teeth, normal things.

Now imagine if you grew up and no matter what decision you chose from above, you’d still suffer. Not knowing how to stand up for yourself to your abuser or make your own decisions. Imagine if you finally learned wrong from right but no matter what you decide, horrible things will happen to you. Imagine trying to escape that at 18 when you can go to college but being told college is not your decision and you’re stuck dealing with the same situation in your abusers fear you’d tell someone.

Again, premeditated/self defense or not, these guys had to do what they had to do to get out of this cycle. They believed that there was no other choice. Imagine being put in a position where murder or suicide was your only option to escape this pain.

People who still side with the prosecution in 2024 literally blow my mind.

I've just came across an incredible, unshared Black Friday deal that I absolutely had to tell you all about. It's for the **MAC MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick**, and trust me, you're going to want to [witness it firsthand](https://savvyfridays.com/deal/mac-macximal-silky-matte-lipstick)!


I've been using this lipstick for months, and I'm so in love with it that I'm actually buying another one with this amazing deal. It's just that good, folks!


Let me tell you why I'm so excited about this lipstick. First off, the texture is unlike anything I've ever tried before. It glides on like silk but sets to this gorgeous matte finish that doesn't dry out my lips. I can wear it all day without that dreaded cracked, parched feeling that some matte lipsticks give you.


The color payoff is insane too. One swipe gives you full, rich color that lasts for hours. I've worn it through coffee dates, work meetings, and even a night out dancing, and it barely budged. And can we talk about the shade range? There's literally something for everyone, from subtle nudes to bold reds and everything in between.


What I love most about this lipstick is how it makes me feel. Every time I put it on, I get an instant confidence boost. It's like my secret weapon for those days when I need a little extra oomph. Plus, the sleek packaging makes me feel like a total boss when I pull it out of my bag for touch-ups.


I'm beyond thrilled that I can snag another one of these at such a great price. Black Friday deals don't get much better than this, in my opinion!


If you've been on the fence about trying this lipstick, or if you're a fellow fan looking to stock up, now's your chance. This deal is too good to pass up, especially if you're in the market for a high-quality, long-lasting lipstick that actually delivers on its promises.


I hope you all get a chance to try it out and love it as much as I do. Happy shopping, everyone!

# Who is Master Thich Phap Hoa?

Master Thich Phap Hoa was born in **1974**, in Can Tho, Viet Nam. He is the eldest son in the family. two sons. Thich Phap Hoa immigrated to Canada when he was 12 years old. At the age of 15, he officially became a monk.

Although he lives and practices in Canada, Master Thich Phap Hoa is still known to many Buddhists at home and abroad through his sermon videos shown in the media.

With extensive knowledge and understanding of Buddhist knowledge through the process of studying and training, Thich Phap Hoa is respected and admired by many Buddhists as if standing in front of a “living treasure” of language and culture. meridian system.

# Master Thich Phap Hoa’s Cultivation Journey

From a young age, Phap Hoa showed that he was a person who had an affinity for Buddhism. At a 2017 lecture on “The Four Types of Ego Clinging”, he shared a story about himself when he was young. It was a full moon day in January when he was 7 years old, and adults took him to the temple.

This temple is a small vihara named Ngoc Thuan in Can Tho. When he was very young and that day he officially became a refugee, his **dharma name was** **Hue Tai**.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, Phap Hoa asked for another wish:

*“Venerable sir, I am taking refuge and now I want to bow to the Buddha. I want to bow to Buddha Shakyamuni, I want to bow to Buddha Maitreya, I want to bow to Buddha Amitabha, I want to bow to Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.”*

Seeing that the boy was young and had a strong affinity for Buddhism, he found four Buddha statues for him and told him to vow to fast for 10 days every month. Phap Hoa followed his mother’s instructions and set up a Buddha altar at home so that every night he could recite sutras and make offerings.

In 1989, when he was virtuous enough, Master Phap Hoa officially became a monk under the guidance of Venerable Thich Thien Tam.

In 1994, when he was just 20 years old, Master Thich Phap Hoa officially became a monk in Plum Village (France) on the occasion of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh’s Huong Tich Forum.

In 2006, he was ordained as abbot of Truc Lam Zen Monastery. In 2007, he became the abbot of the Western Zen Monastery and was elected Director of the Institute of Buddhist Studies in Edmonton (Canada).

# Where is Master Thich Phap Hoa Abbot?

Master Thich Phap Hoa resides at Truc Lam Monastery in Canada, which is the first base of the Institute of Buddhist Studies, located in the city of Edmonton since June 1989.

When newly built, Truc Lam Zen Monastery, located at 10604-108, was a 3-story, 9-room building. Many Buddhist activities have taken place here such as research, cultural activities, Buddhist education…

In 1992, the facility was sold and moved to another address, a larger former church at 10155-89 Street.

In 1996, the Institute of Buddhist Studies decided to build a monastery on a larger plot of land in the city center. This is the current Zen monastery – where Thich Phap Hoa is the abbot.

Since its construction, Truc Lam Monastery has become a familiar and close Buddhist address for many overseas Vietnamese until now.",1,1728731087.0,u_ThichPhapHoa-shop,0,1.0,False

She always let me sit down and have a cup of tea in the morning after she has her breakfast. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that! She is asleep next to me right now! 

I'm teaching her to be more independent. She doesn't need to be in the same room as me all the time. We are working on keeping her out of the kitchen while we are eating and when I'm in the bathroom getting ready for the day.

It's still hard. I still miss my life of lazing on the couch and eating snacks. 

I'm teaching her ""leave it"" with her toys.

I need to work on her recall and leash walking. She will walk to where we are going to go, but refuses to walk home. I think we are going to do some training classes. Next weekend I think we will do her trail in daycare, and if she does well, she can go once a week.

It does get better. I'm not where I used to be before I had a puppy and I just had my senior dog before she got sick and had to be put down.

My goal is to someday soon is to sit at the coffee table with a plate of nachos and a movie and not have to worry about a puppy getting into it!",1,1728729968.0,u_AmandaBG09,0,1.0,False

And I didn't understand half the things people said there.

Ok I made it concise because it was running too old.

I didn't know I was being bullied till my boss labelled it - whatever I described was happening to me at work.

I became aware I was rather attractive only when people gossiped about me and my college friends were surprised that I had never had a boyfriend.

I don't know when to take myself to the doctor. I didn't know coughing for two weeks is not normal until my cousin told me. I used to try to hold in coughs in class because it began to annoy the teachers.

I still mix up left and right. I still struggle telling the time from an analog clock.

I've accepted the autism now but I still feel stupid. And even more stupid by starting on an ADHD journey:

I often choke on water.

I drop things if I'm trying to hold them and talk on the phone.

Today I accidentally burnt my thumb because I forgot I had just picked up the pot with tongs off the stove and set it down. I tried to pick it up by hand.

And the one week I forgot to take Bupropion, I made careless mistakes that I realised only when I got back on the meds. And I can't seem to function without coffee and it seems to also make sleepy immediately after.

I never related to the stereotype of autistic children spinning and laying toys out in neat order. But I played a game called ""dashing wheels"" with my sister in childhood where the purpose was too spin, arms held out and try to crash and make the other kid fall. And I love organizing. And recently also realised (posted about) that the games I like are about putting things in order 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

I never knew I had eye contact issues until my 20s and am just now realising at 32 how much of a problem eye-contact is for me.

I feel like I'm too old to not know such things. I feel so stupid! :(

And, well, being discriminated against isn't really fun. Likewise, **feel free to let me know if you need any accommodations**!

# [ Who am I? ]

* Hey there! My name's Ash. 19M, from Singapore, and with 3 cats: whom are named capo, oya and melho. (*yes, after gang slangs HAHHAHA*) (*Let me know if you have any pets in the last segment of the survey too btw*)
* Been DMing a few short campaigns for 4 years now.
* Music production is my passion and I also really LOVE fashion. But stories, worlds and characters... they are my soulfood. Whether it be video games, shows or character analysis youtube videos. It's why I love DMing!
* I really love how D&D let's us all express ourselves and collaboratively tell a story. It's something I do my best to facilitate so that not only I, but the players as well, can reap the joy of creating something together!

# [ How do I run my games? ]

* To start, **fun between all of us always comes first**. D&D is a game first and foremost, not a responsibility! If this game doesn't cater to what you find fun, it's alright to bring it up. If it's a sensitive/private matter, I'll try and see if it can resolved on the DM's side of the table before we start looking into other courses of action.
* Secondly, I strive to **collaborate with players** to **tell a story** **through their PCs**. This means your usual PC backstory stuff, collaborative worldbuilding, ample opportunity for the party to RP and bond with each other!
* Continuing from the above, I run my games with **a lot of RP'in**g. This doesn't solely mean social encounters though. I treat combat encounters as opportunities for RP as well! Be it long dialogues between players and hostiles, hostage situations, random quips and lines from creatures etc.
* The sessions themselves will usually have **a light-hearted tone** while still **taking the PC's actions and choices seriously**, in the sense that the world will tangibly respond to them accordingly. (in short, consequences! whether it be light or heavy, good or bad)
* I also try and strive for heavy, **heart-to-heart moments from time to time** too! Although, the **frequency and occurrence of it depends on the party** because it's admittedly really difficult to make such moments feel authentic and natural if the players aren't in with it as well.
* All of the above means that the **party's choices** will really **matter for the tone and direction of the game** as such. If you really want a specific something to happen, you'll have to make it happen (it can happen out of character as well, thru metagaming a reason and whatnot)! This also means that **character deaths are on the table**, but the threat of it **doesn't often crop up** in my games unless it's meant to be an intense fight.
* It's also why I generally follow **the rule of cool**. I enjoy getting surprised by what kinda creative stuff people can conjure up!
* Tone-wise, my sessions **tend to have an element of brutality or body horror** sowed about as well. It **isn't intensely focused** on (nor too intense, I hope...) but it will appear in forms of injuries towards PCs, brief descriptions of objects or environments and happenings that occur throughout the world. However, if there's anything you know that will disturb you, or you become disturbed during the session itself, I will gladly not bring it up or stop it for you!
* Examples for above **(TRIGGER WARNING!**): *bloody decapitation, mangled fresh corpses, cluster of fleshy pus-filled holes.*
* For ambience, I **use soundscapes** while letting **players pick the music** for the encounter!
* I also mainly use **online pictures and maps for game assets** like tokens, object descriptions and so on. This means that the assets might have a really inconsistent or incoherent artstyle and might break your ability to immerse yourself in the game!
* And, in general, I also tend to love **referencing/copying from a bunch of pop-culture media** in my games if it bothers you, like using Devastator (transformers) as a golem in one of my games.
* Unfortunately, I'm also **not an actor nor a voice actor**. I try my best for various NPCs and their voices during the session, but it can get tough to maintain their character nuance before they start acting like cliche character tropes if you may be put off by that!
* **For more details** to my DMing style, expectations, and my strengths and weaknesses (at least what I believe them to be), you are free to **check out the document underneath**!

*\*Easter Egg: there'll be some really random questions that appear in the survey later so feel free to recommend me some of your favourite songs when answering those questions!*

# [ Campaign? ]

Without knowledge on who the PCs are, it's hard for me to come up with a campaign at the moment. So here is the homebrew setting instead!

It will be set in a **homebrew setting called** ***Symbols*** where, as the namesake suggests, symbols are incredibly important by serving as the source of magic in this world. (a very original name! >:3)

Almost everything magical runs on these *""symbols*"": spells, channel divinities, wild-shape and even special martial abilities such as a fighter's echo or a barbarian's spirit guardian. And similarly, *""symbols""* like pizzas come in many shapes and flavours. They can exist as your typical magic seals, objects such as a holy symbol or spellcasting focus, hand-signs, and even as martial art forms.

Evidently, it is a high-fantasy/high magic setting, like Forgotten Realm's Faerun, and the starting area will reflect that: being set in a very progressive and *(relatively)* modern medieval society where magic is the coffee of its society, being used to run A LOT of things and only steadily becoming more relied on to a fault. Not just that though, the nation is a melting-pot of humanoid races ranging from dragonborns to harpies even! This nation was set-up centuries ago through the culmination of alliances between city-states in a desperate attempt to survive being besieged and overtaken by the surrounding empires and tribes, resulting in a bureaucratic nation where overtime, it gained more and more cities and members. As such, many clans and families rose to the occasion and started forming cliques and groups like in highschool. And just like in highschool, they can't really quit because they're too afraid to *(they'd die)* or they'd lose all that sweet sweet power baby.

Currently, the nation's ongoing affairs are a mess but people still make do. As long as the nation's barriers continue to hold up and protect the nation,🔥*everything is fine*🔥. From government infighting, violent faction feuds, a burgeoning underworld and religious rivalries: a place rife with conflict, and ripe for change. A nation ready to be laid to waste in the wake of the PCs, reminiscent of the bygone ruins left over after the terrible massacres committed by the Demon King during an ancient era.

As working with my 2017 MBP gets more and more annoying, I'm looking to buy a new one. I’ve done a lot of research but still haven't made a decision, so I’d be delighted to hear your opinions.

My usual setup involves using my MacBook Pro as a second monitor alongside my 5K LG UltraFine, but I also do a lot of mobile work (just using the MacBook). Most of the time, I have a ton of apps open simultaneously, mostly office-related ones (DevonThink, MS Office, Firefox, Spotify, Banking). That said, I'm also a researcher and lecturer, so RStudio, local LLMs, and video recording/editing are occasionally part of my workflow. I’d be thrilled if my MacBook could keep me from drinking too much coffee while waiting ;)

Moneywise, I tend to hold on to my hardware for years, so I’m willing to invest a bit more, though I’d prefer not to overspend unnecessarily.

Right now, I’m leaning towards the MBP 14"" with an 11-core CPU/14-core GPU, 18 GB RAM, and a 512 GB SSD. But I’m also open to spending an extra 500€ for the 12-core CPU/18-core GPU and 1 TB SSD if it's worth the investment.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this setup, especially around the RAM (there seem to be very mixed opinions here) and CPU choice.",1,1728728930.0,mac,1,1.0,False
