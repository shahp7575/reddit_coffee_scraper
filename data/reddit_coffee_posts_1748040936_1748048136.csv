My name is Rafael (27M), and I am DM looking to run a homebrewed campaign in the fantasy, Witcher/Dragon Age: Origins-inspired region known as Laraevia!

A little about me: I am a recently graduated law student (currently studying for the bar, a famously enjoyable experience), and I have been playing D&D for about 8 years now. Of those years, I’ve been DM'ing for about six. I am a devout listener of Not Another D&D Podcast, and I love Dimension 20 and all things DROPOUT. When not planning/playing D&D, I am a big fan of basketball (still devastated by Luka), video games (churning through the Oblivion Remake right now), and staying active (weight-training, basketball, running late to plans, etc).

I have run several long-term campaigns in the past. My most recent campaign (which got started by a post I made last year) wrapped up in May. Sadly, one of our party members had to retire from the table, so we are on the hunt for one to two new players to round out the new party!

**Here is a brief overview of the campaign setting:**

***Laraevia*** *is a gritty high-fantasy setting, defined by social intrigue and pragmatic skepticism. The kingdom is a persistent contradiction. It is a young kingdom stuck in the old ways. A region seeping arcane mystery overwhelmed by a citizenry that seethes at the mention of magic. A heroic history so honored yet so meticulously misremembered. As Winter approaches, the crisp northern air blows down from the snowy tops of the Maekir Peaks, reminding the citizens of Laraevia of the harshness of the world.* ***The Age of Weary*** *has befallen the Kingdom. But, Laraevians are stubborn. When rest calls to them, they trudge onward with deaf ears and furled brows. The Kingdom teeters on the precipice of something . . . monumental. Magic is slowly returning to the region. How will the kingdom respond? Who can say? What is certain is that Laraevia is perfect for molding. It searches for a stubborn yet optimistic group of adventurers. Adventurers capable of being the hand that shapes the future and the kiln that burns fiercely enough to cement it.*

**When**:

\- *Preferably*: Saturday afternoon after 1:00 pm;

\- Sunday afternoons after 1:00 pm; OR

\- Friday evenings after 6:00 pm.

**What I Can Offer:**

\- A safe, respectful, and friendly environment for all individuals to have fun.

\- A DM style that prioritizes player engagement and enjoyment; nothing is more fulfilling than seeing players see their backstory and choices truly shape the game.

\- Effort: I spend a lot of prep time making sure everything is set up before the session. I have props, music, battle maps, and access to a lot of character art to assist in the campaign immersion.

\- Openness: I am open to basically whatever you want to do with your characters: min-maxing, deep story, combat fanatic, whatever – all are good in my book as long as other players' enjoyment isn’t hampered.

**What I'm Looking For:**

\- One (1) to Two (2) **respectful**, **enthusiastic**, and **fun** players. I am open to completely new players or seasoned veterans, so long as you have a great attitude and a willingness to learn & collaborate. Both my partner and the other returning player began the last campaign as complete newbies. So, she and the other player will be able to provide some advice and counsel to any newer players as well!

\- People with a healthy balance of seriousness and humor. I like to run sessions with a nice mix of serious roleplaying and some joking and fooling around. Though they have their places, *please no dedicated meme/edge lords here*.

\- Ideally, people around my age (27), as our group's age ranges between 25 and 30, though I’m open to having any player 18+ at the table (player maturity and personality are more important and indicative of a great player).

\- People willing to engage in active world-building and roleplay.

\- People willing to communicate what would make their D&D experience better and more enjoyable.

Please fill out this Google form if you are interested: [https://forms.gle/aWNMEcAvU2xJwZN57](https://forms.gle/aWNMEcAvU2xJwZN57)

I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can. And, as a note: admittedly, I'm not 100% comfortable sharing my location/address with strangers to first meet up; so, if I do reach out, I'll set up a chat at a coffee shop to discuss details and just do an overall vibe check.

Thank you again!

1ktz65r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktz65r/yesterday_the_lot_across_the_street_was_empty/,"Yesterday, the lot across the street was empty. Today, it's occupied by an apartment complex.","**9:12, June 28th, 2025**

Yesterday, the lot across the street was empty. Today, it's occupied by an apartment complex.

I almost didn’t register it. I could blame this on the stress, running late, or the hangover, but the fact is that yesterday the lot was vacant. No ‘coming soon’ sign, no signs of heavy machinery, no materials left by careless construction workers. Regardless of the fact that I was running late, I sat in my idling car, locked in a staring contest with the seemingly immaculate building. Largely euclidean, it was the epitome of what one would describe as ‘modern’ architecture. Much of the building was glass, reflecting what little light the dismal gray sky let through. This reflection meshed with the colors chosen for the smooth paneling of the complex, with the sterile tones limited exclusively to gray, white, and brown. On portions of the lot not now occupied by the complex, there was a lush and deep green lawn, heavily manicured and likely partially synthetic. It was hard to grasp how this town would support the apartment complex, its four stories monolithic in comparison to reserved and sparse commercial buildings and neighborhoods. In an almost comical fashion, I closed my burning eyes and held them shut for a few seconds, half expecting the complex to be gone upon reopening them. It, of course, remained. As the first fat raindrops of the impending storm hit my windshield, I gathered my things, shut off the engine, and headed into work.

By the time I burst through the office door, the scattered raindrops had crescendoed into a torrential downpour, which I tried in a vain attempt to avoid by holding my leather briefcase above my head. The office was a shared commercial space, with most of the building occupied by my employer, save for a new age smoothie shop called Miska’s Tonics that I heavily suspect is a money laundering operation. I swept my thinning hair out of my face as I hurried past the reception desk, avoiding eye contact with Joy, the receptionist, whose name betrayed her demeanor. 

“You’re late,” she croaked, spewing raspberry jelly and sprinkles from her morning donut onto today's unfortunate choice of a white blouse.

I paid her the complimentary nod and feeble smile, and hurriedly arrived at my cubicle. Booting up my computer, I noted the time–8:17. Regarding my recent arrivals, this was good timing. A flash of light in the corner of my eye and the subsequent crack of rolling thunder directed my attention towards the window. The sky had become significantly darker, and the power line cables swayed tumultuously in the growing gales. Across the cracked and deserted road populated exclusively by scattered and steadily growing puddles, the apartment complex stood in almost taunting contrast to its desolate surroundings. I absently noted it had no doors on the side of the building facing the road.

“S’posed to be a biggun.” 

The thick Minnesotan accent was a dead giveaway. I smoothed down my wrinkled shirt and adjusted my tie as I spun around in my office chair, and was greeted by the hooked nose, jet black hair, and bright green eyes of my employer peering over the edge of my cubicle. 

“Looks like it already is,” I responded, my voice hoarse from lack of use.

Robbie likes to attribute the employees' resentment towards him to the hierarchy and resulting natural order that office spaces often hold. I, however, could give you at least ten other sources of this resentment. At some point during my three years of employment at Humboldt & Sherman, Robbie had gotten the impression that we have a sort of office friendship. Though I am still not sure what the catalyst for this was, I am sure that it likely had something to do with my reserved nature. I minded my own business, and was not, to the best of my knowledge, disliked by my co-workers. Though, to someone as socially inept as Robbie, this ambivalence that the office held for me could easily be misinterpreted as animosity. If, for any reason I was disliked by them, it was almost certainly due to the one way friendship that me and Robbie held. 

My heart sank as I watched the top of his head hurriedly bob around the walls of my cubicle to the opening, and dropped a stuffed manilla envelope on my desk.

“Notes on the Anders case. I want you to look through them and let me know what you think.” As he marched away, I caught a whiff of his notorious coffee breath.

After Sherman’s death, Robbie became Humboldt’s right-hand man—thanks to his uncanny knack for spotting phony insurance claims. This brutal and unforgiving quirk had earned him the less than affectionate nickname ‘Honey badger.’ Though Humboldt’s only son, Blake, inherited the company upon his passing, he promptly and happily handed office leadership over to Robbie and fucked off to Florida. Since then, Robbie has been parading around the corpse of the homegrown family business while Blake does god knows what in the land of gators, tourism, and conservatives. Unfortunately, Robbie’s near-savant talent to sniff out bullshit claims didn’t translate well to picking up on social cues, another potential source of the disdain that the office held towards him.

“Wait,” blurted my mouth as he hastily walked away. I watched the top of his head spin around and start its jounce back to my cubicle. Flustered, and not quite sure why I called him back, I asked him about the sudden new housing across the road. He raised his eyebrows and gave me a queer look.

“Aboot time they’re done with it. The sound of that darn machinery was drivin’ me bonkers.” He resumed his hotfoot, leaving me in my cubicle, confounded.

In conjunction with my therapy and new medication, Diazaxeprenol (‘Be you, today’), this journaling is supposed to help me work through things. So far, it's only served as a convenient distraction, my typing acting as a guise of productivity. I know what’s in that manilla envelope, and I'll take any potential distraction. I’ve overheard the office gossip surrounding the case. The reason Robbie left it on my desk is beyond me; if he thought it important enough to leave on my desk, he’s already made up his mind about it.",1,1748047437.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

AIO for being super direct in communicating my concerns?

My wife (64F) and I (62M) have had a number of relationship challenges. I’m the more insecurely attached and my wife trends avoidant. My wife’s mother was a major narcissist, I’m pretty sure my wife’s not a covert narcissist, but she has some learned CN behaviors from her mom. Though I’m the insecurely attached one, I’ve always been the main provider by a big margin for nearly all our time together. I left my tech career 2 years ago to start a small consulting business. It gives me great schedule flexibility and pays our bills plus a bit more. We’re set for retirement.

My wife and I recently bought an apartment in another city to be near our grandkids, with the intention of moving there full time. We split our time between our house and apartment. Along with this, we’ve started to develop a friend network in the new city, something we both want to do.

Last fall, about a month after my wife’s mother died, I bought the book “Getting the Love You Want” and read it. I then asked my wife to read it … she was dealing with some anxiety following her mom’s death and told me she wanted to prioritize her anxiety first. I was completely supportive of delaying the book but told her it was still important to me that she read it once her anxiety was resolved. I encouraged / pushed her to get therapy and helped her sort through therapist options. The therapy along with restarting a medication really helped a ton, and by January she was much better. I should add that I handled everything with her mom’s estate and taxes too, and essentially handed her things to sign or push a button. I wanted to lighten her burden. Around that time I also made a partly successful but premature attempt to fix our dead bedroom.

About 3 weeks ago, my wife drove over while I stayed back to oversee a roof replacement on our house. I packed everything up for her and made a point of pulling out the book, which had sat untouched for more than six months. My wife commented that having time alone at the apartment would be a good opportunity to read it. A week later, I flew over (a Friday) and when she picked me up at the airport, mentioned how she had met up with a pickleball group that morning and played for the first time. That’s great, and I reminded her that I was looking forward to trying it too. I’m no athlete, but in far better shape than most men my age.

When we got to the apartment, I noticed that the bookmark was at the very front of the book. When I asked my wife about it, she gaslit me and told me it was never her intention to read it that week, and she’d been busy (ummm … in reality she had loads of time). I got pretty upset with her and reiterated how important it is to me that she put energy into improving our relationship too. That prompted a burst of reading which petered out after 6 of the 13 chapters (not including exercises which obviously we need to do together when she finishes). It sat unread for another week and then an inquiry from me prompted reading of one more chapter. At this point, she’s managed to read 1 chapter over the past 9 days.

Last night, as we were returning from dinner and bedtime books with the grandkids, I mentioned how that I had the entire next day (today, Friday) completely free and the weather was going to be beautiful (after a week of blech) … and how great that was. We got back to the apartment, each poured a drink, and as I sat down to contemplate talking about plans together on Friday on my free day, she told me that she’d accepted an offer from the pickleball group to join her second match. I asked her when it would be … essentially the whole morning. I asked her if she’d ask them if there was room for a plus one, since I was also interested in playing. She told me that she “wasn’t comfortable” with that. I asked again, she refused and suggested I reach out directly to a guy we both know (“Fred”, great guy) to ask if I could come. I told her that was less comfortable than her asking, since she was the one with the invite. She offered to cancel pickleball, I said no that would be ridiculous after accepting, plus I didn’t want to be the bad guy. She promised to ask “Fred” the next morning at pickleball.

I was upset, calmly (but with a snippy edge, I won’t lie) told her why I was unhappy with her and took my drink and a book to our bedroom. I kept thinking about how if I didn’t try, she’d be perfectly happy to just leave things be, despite our relationship being a mess. I moved to another bed, could barely sleep and managed less than 75 minutes of sleep according to my watch (seems about right). When she woke up after a great night’s sleep, I told her that I was going for a bike ride. I ended up going 50 miles. I needed to numb my feelings, and that helped along with the beer I had for lunch.

She acknowledges (after first arguing to the contrary) that she should have discussed our Friday plans with me before accepting the invitation. When I asked her if she asked Fred about me joining, she said he was surprised to hear it. She also admitted that there would have been space for me after all. I suspect this is because I’ll see Fred tomorrow morning at a weekly group walk, and I'll find out anyway. She denies everything else, including hearing me express joy the night before at having a beautiful free day the next day. 

I told her today that I feel like my needs and feelings are unimportant to her, and it bothers me. Our entire relationship has been about her needs, and I admit that at times I let her down, especially emotionally. I have autistic characteristics but haven’t been diagnosed. I’m not good at reading other people’s motivations, which is inconvenient in business but awful in relationships. TBF she’s also not good at all about communicating her needs clearly.

I’m lowkey spiraling right now, and I feel like I’m getting zero empathy from her. She knows I’m struggling. I softly but sternly told her how I feel, and she’s painting me as my problem for overreacting.

AIO by calling out her BS?

P.S. She is sitting on the couch as I type this, scrolling on her phone. The book is sitting untouched 2 feet from her on the coffee table. I said nothing.",1,1748047186.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Why summon a storm, if you didn't want the rain? Why ask for fire, if your are fearful of the flames once it's been lit? You conjured me. Word by word, line by line— you painted a picture of a woman with wild eyes and a trembling soul, someone who loves too deeply, feels too much, cries in the car to songs that speak to her soul and whispers “I love you” like it’s a rebellion.

And I— foolish, hopeful me— answered.

I showed up.

Not in whispers. Not in fantasy. I showed up with blood in my veins and a voice in my throat. I gave you softness and shadow. Grit and grace. I gave you the kind of vulnerability men spend entire lifetimes claiming they want—until it’s staring them in the face.

And you?

You ran.

You gave me crumbs, then silence. Faded into the mist like some tragic poet, as if your silence was romantic. As if quiet ever made a woman feel held.

But I am not your metaphor. Not your muse. Not some passing inspiration you pick up when you want to feel something and drop when it starts to feel real.

I am a woman.

I am \*the\* woman.

The one you claimed to be building space for. The one whose fears and fire you named with eerie precision. The one you described down to the way her voice shakes when she trusts someone for the first time. How dare you write me like that and not recognize me when I stand in front of you?

You asked for her—the woman who cries when the world is overwhelming but still hums while making coffee. Who loves with a devotion that could tear the heavens apart.

You begged the universe for a love that could bring you to your knees.

And when it came?

You didn’t kneel.

You disappeared.

You don’t get to write a storm and then flinch at the first crack of thunder. You don’t get to call in a woman made of lightning and soul, then act surprised when she sets your world on fire.

You don’t get to romanticize the ache and recoil when it asks to be held.

I came to you honest. Open. Whole in my brokenness. And you proved you only knew how to worship a woman in theory— not in practice. You wanted the parts of me that looked poetic. The pain you could aestheticize. The edges you could describe like scars on a page, as long as you never had to hold the bleeding.

So here’s the truth:

You didn’t want love.

You wanted a mirror.

You wanted someone to make you feel profound without ever having to be accountable.

You wanted to be the man in the story. But I wasn’t a chapter. I was the whole damn book.

And you didn’t even have the courage to read me cover to cover.

So don’t you dare write about the one that got away. I didn’t get away. I showed up.

You let me slip through your fingers like every other good thing you thought you weren’t worthy of.

And maybe you were right.

Because loving a woman like me? Takes more than pretty words and poetry. It takes presence. It takes truth. It takes showing up on the days when you’re terrified and staying when you feel unworthy.

It takes a man.

And you, my dear— were just a boy with a pen.

From good to bad to worse to worst to hell


Just want to get it all out.

Someone matched with me and he said we would have a good time together, and asked to meet. I didn't know anything about him, neither did he about me. Next day he asks ""how do you feel about the sex we are going to have today?"" And I just say, good. We meet the same day.

He asks to go for coffee. I appreciate that we didn't go to his house first thing and that we got to talk a bit first. He paid and I felt bad. He was very observative and noticed

I struggled with eye contact and only did it for one second. And it was the only time I ever looked at him.

We went to his place; he had two dogs. We went to bed, I was super super panicked and he knew; he hugged me and said, it will all be fine, don't worry. I appreciated this as well because he didn't try to give me alcohol or anything.

We start. It's okay, and we hug and my soul heals. And then we go to the bathroom and he asks if I've given head and I say no, and he asks if I want to, I say yes. And I try, but, weeell, I start suffocating. I do not stop, I just take little breaks, but he starts pushing my head fast and I start puking in my mouth and I swallow the puke, until I can't anymore and I puke on my legs. First flag. He asks if I want to stop, I say yes and then he says he did not notice I puked. I apologize for puking over and over. I am so tired by then and do not feel well that I slip in the tub and I hurt myself.

Anyhow, he hugs me, kisses me on my way out, and I leave. I apologize again in the messages. We text a bit. We start meeting the same day every week. Sometimes he says we'll go for coffee again but that never happens again.

He is not sure he will be alone on that day so it's never certain that we will meet weekly. I never really know if I'll see him again.

Next week, he says there'll be relatives at home so he asks what to do and my stupid ass, says let's go to a hotel, I'll pay for it (it was my last money). And so I did. He came and he was like, get undressed. I felt horrible. And it began. At the shower, he held my neck with strength. Like the way we strangle someone. Third flag. He also covered my mouth and nose on bed and I thought I'd suffocate. At some point we took a break and he tells me to find other men to go have sex with, too. I ask him if he's met many girls and he says he doesn't even remember how many. I started telling him of my su!c!dality and health problems. I was hiding my face with a pillow and saying I wanted to d!e. Second flag. He told me to go back to bed, despite my state. I did but said, what's the point? He replied, we are having a good time. I said, no. He said he thought I was having a good time. I said, no. He was like, okay, one more time and we won't do it again. I do what he says, feeling beyond su!c!dal. He finishes, dresses up, gets ready to leave and asks me to leave, too. I refuse to. He leaves and says he'll be sad if I do not message him next morning. I go insane. After an hour or so, I text him a huge message about how he had suggested we sleep together and how he just did what he wanted and left. He said I'm wrong and he was coming back. I said no, don't come. He came. He said he cares and I'm wrong about him and that's where he asked me to give me a massage and I said yes but it was not a massage, it was pain. He wrapped something around my neck and pulled my head. It really hurt. Then, we watched some comedy episodes (he brought his laptop) while we cuddled. Then he asked if he wanted to cuddle while we sleep, I said yes. So we did. He wasn't sexual with me again.

After the hotel, I knew his full name and phone number.

I pulled away twice, both times he asked why instantly. At morning he left for work. I felt dead for some reason, destroyed.

He never texted me first through the weeks but always replied to my texts. After the hotel, I'd gotten very confused. So were my texts.

We disagreed often, he said we were FWB, I said he wasn't acting like a friend and that we weren't friends. He said I did not understand. 

He knew I was ODing on some meds to stay asleep. He sent me a helpline but never asked if I was okay the entire week. Only messaged me when it was time to meet again. I told him days later that this had really saddened me.

We met more times at his house. I started bringing him little gifts, felt like I owed him. He kissed me. One day we didn't go to bed straight away, we just stayed on the couch and cuddled and I had his dog on my lap and we watched something and then had some foreplay and it was really nice. But that's the only time there was any foreplay.

So I bled most of the times. And it really really hurt.

He had noticed my sh wounds. He asked me to promise not to do it again but I always did and had more the next time.

I started asking him if he was seeing others. He said no.

I started blaming him for lying. One day I thought he blocked me and I woke him up with a call. He was annoyed.

When he thought I had blocked him, he texted me to ask why.

Some bad night I text him to hurt me next time. He agrees. Then I ask him to kill me, he says no and says it'll be like the ""massage"". Next time he is indeed rough but he slaps me by saying ""I'll do you a favor once"" and I did not expect this. I thought he'd just be rougher but not actually hit me. I teared up.

Some day he asks me to meet one day earlier. I go that day and wait but he never comes and I text him to ask if I made a mistake of the day and he says yes (even though I had made no mistake) but that he'd come to go for a coffee. I see the message, before he deletes it. Fourth flag. I ask, why did you delete it? He says, I made typos. I call him out about lying, and then he says he has. A work call soon and that's why he deleted it. He comes for a while and talks to me a bit. We exchange gifts. He then sends me a screenshot of a simple Viber call and says ""this is the conference call I had"", bullshit but I pretend to believe it and apologize. He says I'm forgiven.

We meet the next day. He is sweet. I tell him I got lost and I'll be a bit late and he calls and then he asks where I am and that he's worried. He comes wait for me with the dogs. We do the same stuff, and then he says he's concerned about me bleeding and that I have to go to a doctor and only if I'm okay, will we meet again. I explain I feel like he rejects me. He also talks to me about the sh wounds and is supportive and kind. He says he will be sad if I do it again.

I notice that I'm blocked on the dating app, but I hadn't realized when he actually blocked me there.

But I go to the gyn, and my tests are fine. I tell him, but he says I have a problem and that he can't keep seeing me again because he doesn't want to cause me anything bad. I tell him my tests are fine but he acts like this doesn't matter. He says we won't meet and that we can just talk through texts. I go insane and start feeling su!c!dal. It was the day I was getting out the hospital and the only reason I had tried to get out sooner was to meet him, he had said we'd go for coffee at a specific cafe but apparently he never meant it. I tell him how I feel, and I beg for help, he sends me a helpline. I start rambling in nonsense, like, it really doesn't make any sense, and I insult him, he asks to never talk to him again, because I insulted him, and then I call him and he blocks me everywhere. I start sending messages through other numbers and multiple apps. Instant blocks I get.

I keep sending long texts, begging, explaining. Instant blocks. I tell him I'm going to his home to cut me off face to face, not through texts, and he replies that he will call the police if he sees me, to report me and set restrictive measures against me and that I had insulted him and that was why he didn't want to see me ever again. I am blocked again before I can reply.

And then next morning I send him I'm going to his home. I am blocked again. But I do go. First thing he says when he sees me is, ""Oh. I told you something yesterday"". I ask, why did you cut me off through a text? He says nothing, leaves, comes back in a while and I overhear the call to the police. I have a huge panic attack and start hitting my head on the wall. Police comes, long story short, he shows them the messages and all, they say I have to leave and that they are letting me off with some references idk. He asks me not to do this to myself. They ask him if he wants to say something to me and he wishes me to heal from my mental problems whatever it is and from my family problems. I am crying and tell him I don't want any wishes. And I leave.

But then I start harming myself to cause a deadly situation, which I manage to, and I pass old keys with tags with his name and address on them around town, and out his home. And I end up in the hospital very soon, but I begin using his number and address for different things, I get things ordered to his house, he ends up changing his number.

I ended up in a psych ward and the rest is hell.

I am moving from Illinois to Denver for a job in the next few weeks and am doing virtual tours for a few different places. My options after searching have pretty much been narrowed down to an apartment just outside of  the south boundary of Baker in Speer (slightly east of Broadway), and two others in Congress Park that are about a block south of Colfax. 

I wasn’t able to visit the city in person due to a quick timeline of interviewing, finishing grad school, and moving, but from what I’ve been reading it looks like both of these areas are decent in terms of safety and access to public transit. I’ll be working downtown, and would definitely prefer to take the bus rather than driving. Walkability, coffee shops, thrifting, music venues etc are all important to me but I’ve gathered that downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods aren’t too far apart for those to be huge dealbreakers. 

Are there any obvious pros/cons to these areas that I should know about? My decision will probably just come down to the first available location, but for peace of mind it would be nice to hear some local opinions. Any general Denver advice or opinions from locals would also be appreciated!!

But they’re worse than your typical “oh what if I fall down the stairs while holding baby”, it’s more like “what if I grabbed her by the ankles and WWE slammed her against my coffee table”

I also have amazing mom intuition! I wake up moments before she even cries out for me in the night. One time something inside told me to pick her up and not even a second later, a toddler threw a fork directly at where she was laying. 

Now my question is how do you know the difference between something genuinely pulling you to take baby out of danger before you know it will happen vs a bad intrusive thought?

Last night we had a Nor’Easter: 7in of rain, 60 mph winds, crazy lightening. It was at night so she was asleep in her crib in the nursery. I woke up sweating feeling like a tree was going to fall on her room so I went and got her and brought her into our bed for the night. Woke up and everything was in one piece, not even a branch to be found on the ground. 

Is this just motherhood? Will I spend the rest of my life in fear of something hurting her? I remember coming home from the hospital and telling my mom I haven’t slept in a couple days, and she told me to get ready because I won’t sleep for the rest of my life. 

Any tips on how to manage intrusive thoughts? Better recognize them? Do I keep leaning into bad ones like the storm just in case it’s some mom intuition? ",5,1748046397.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False

Excellent buy. Loving being able to recreate my favorite lattes from various cafes, and even experiment with my own creations. This whole time, I've been using Hamilton Beach's Electric Coffee Grinder to make espresso (I KNOW. SILLY LITTLE WALMART BLADE GRINDER😂). Believe it or not, I've successfully dialed in for espresso even with my current grinder: one timed-cycle on the finest setting + another press of the same button for a duration of 9 seconds gets me to a grind that's fine enough to pull a shot for 25-30 seconds with my Flair. Now, I don't know what kind of palate I have, but the shots have been tasting better and better throughout the year I've been practicing. Now, I'm ready to buy an actual coffee grinder.
I love w the well-rounded concept of the 1Zpresso K-Ultra / Max, but my gut is telling me that I'm going to get annoyed with hand grinding after a while. At this price, I would much rather just get a machine that will just do the grinding for me, and probably hunt for a travel hand grinder in the future.

Things about me as a home-barista:
- 90% of my drinks are sweet treats!
- Of all the beans I grind, maybe 30% are cold brew or French press (which I enjoy black) and 70% lattes, so I'm hoping for versatility.
- I am VERY limited on space. Small apartment.
- I'll make espresso probably 4-5 times a week, but I think it'd be more often if my grinding workflow was more seemless.
- I often swap between regular and defcaf beans.
- I live in eastern PA.

TLDR;
I was dead-set on the Turin DF54 but the ESP supposedly has excellent customer service? Do y'all think Baratza has better longevity, or is the DF54? Where would you purchase each of these grinders? For the DF54, what’s the difference between the 110-120v and the 220-240v?

I started Contrave (through my doctor and pharmacy via Ridgeway for $99 mo) two months ago. I ramped up to the full dosage within the first three weeks. I had bad headaches the first couple of weeks but they have since subsided. 

I’m female, 42 and 5’4” and my starting weight was 168 (the highest I’ve been ever, even when I was pregnant 15 years ago).  Today I’m at 153 lbs. A 15 pound loss in two months, not too bad. 

The first month I lost approximately 10 pounds and then the weight loss seemed to slow. I did have a weekend where I left my medicine at work, so I missed 5 doses. I also had Easter during that time and some other celebrations. 

I typically go out to eat 1x on the weekend for a nicer meal and have one cocktail. During the week I have my coffee in the morning around 7am and take my first dose. I don’t usually eat breakfast, but will have a granola bar if I feel queasy. I will have a snack (less than 200 calories) for lunch, come home and maybe have another snack if I am feeling hungry and I’ll take my second dose. I try to have a reasonable dinner, I do a lot of hello fresh recipes so typically it’s a well balanced meal. I don’t usually eat anything after dinner. 

In the past I would calorie count, and it does work, but it is so hard to stick to 1200 calories or less. With Contrave I’m not as hungry and I just don’t think about food as much. When I would only calorie count I would obsess about what I was going to eat and I was hungry all the time. It wasn’t sustainable. Now that I’m on Contrave, maintaining a calorie deficit is much easier and I really don’t have to think about it much at all. 

My goal weight is 135-140lbs. I hope to hit that by the end of July, worst case end of summer. Once I reach my goal weight I plan to try a maintenance dose of 2 pills a day. ",3,1748046106.0,Contrave,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I was officially diagnosed with AS today. As much as I am relieved to know that I haven’t been downplaying the severity of my pain, I’m honestly pretty scared.

I’ve been dealing with chronic pain in my lower back since I was a teen. In the last year or so, my jaw has also been causing me pain & locking up. I knew I should get screened after I started to experience pain, locking, and inflammation in both my hip & my elbow.

There have been a few jobs that I’ve had to leave after experiencing an injury; looking back, I used to beat myself up so hard over it. I used to think I was weak, or overreacting. Warehouse jobs, big box retailers, even coffee shops. They’ve all been too strenuous on my body, and I’ve never lasted more than a couple months at them.

I guess the main reason for this post is that I need advice. Apart from what the rheumatologist explained, I feel like I’m on an uncertain path. Are there any activities I should avoid? What can I do to minimize the effect that AS has on my day-to-day life?

By Judith McCarson-Byrne, Child Ethics Analyst & Former Pacifier Lobbyist

⸻

When the Ethical Baby took the UN stage this week—clad in an ill-fitting bowtie and what appeared to be an organic cotton diaper—I, like many, laughed. And then I cried. And then I scheduled an emergency call with my child’s preschool to discuss whether I was a fascist for enforcing nap time.

But behind the spit bubbles and the vaguely accusatory cooing, The Ethical Baby raises a critical point we’ve all been dodging with increasingly plush bassinet padding: Babies have no rights, no recourse, and no say in their own poop schedule. That should bother us.

⸻

The Charade of Autonomy

We’ve built an entire cultural mythos around infant “consent.” Ask any modern parent: we narrate every action. “Now I’m going to pick you up,” we say, lifting them against their will. “Time to change your diaper!”—as though the baby’s opinion, if expressed, wouldn’t simply be “Let me crawl under the coffee table and vanish from view.”

And yet, when the Ethical Baby says, “I want breathable cotton and choice in juice,” we laugh.

That’s not consent culture. That’s hypocrisy in a diaper pail.

⸻

Critics argue that the Ethical Baby is too young to understand the consequences of going diaper-free. That may be true. But so are many adults when it comes to cryptocurrency or home juicing machines. We don’t revoke their autonomy.

The baby’s protest may not be verbal, but it is felt. Redness, wailing, that haunted look they give you after a particularly offensive wipe. These are not the reactions of an unfeeling meatloaf. These are political statements.

⸻

What would ethical reform look like?
	-Rotational diaper time, based on mood and planetary alignment.
	-Consent-based mush tastings with certified puree sommeliers.
	-An infant-led task force to redefine “appropriate burping protocols.”

More controversially, the Ethical Baby has demanded a juice council, which some fear could lead to a soft drink monopoly run by toddlers. But to those I say: so what? It’s no worse than the sippy cup-industrial complex we already live in.

——-

We can no longer ignore the moral implications of strapping people into Velcro pants and pretending their opinion doesn’t count because they haven’t filed taxes yet. Bodily autonomy cannot begin at puberty. It must begin with the first emphatic fart of protest.

The Ethical Baby has spoken—without words, without control over bowel function, and without a single law on their side. And still, they managed to hold a room full of ambassadors hostage with a single well-timed scream.

Isn’t that, in the end, the purest form of democracy?

1ktynqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktynqz/i_woke_up_from_a_coma_but_im_not_sure_whats/,I woke up from a coma but i'm not sure what's happening,"A couple of years ago, i was in uni. I had a bad habit of drinking, but i never thought it would cause any harm. I was wrong.

My parents are very conservative due to their religion. Good thing i was able to go to another city to start studying, but this led to me drinking even more. Beatrice, my younger sister knew it, but never told our parents since we always kept each other's secrets from them.

My memory is not very reliable here, so i'm mostly telling what people told me about this day, but i was at a party at a friend's house and drank more than usual. I had to go home, and went there with my car, so i started driving it even if i knew it was dangerous. I brought up a friend (Mike) with me in the car too, since he lived near me. I didn't really care about the danger, i did that before and it was fine, surelly this time won't be different. But it was different. We don't know exactly why, but i drove out of the road in a bridge, and the car fell in the river below.

That night i suffered permanent brain damage due to the impact and minutes under water. Mike managed to get out of the hospital in a couple weeks, but i wouldn't wake up, no matter what. Soon the doctors realized that i was in a deep coma, and could stay in vegetative state for years.

My family was told about the possibility of me never waking up, and needless to say it was a shock. Beatrice was still in high school and my parents have been putting a lot of expectations on me. They would make anything, i mean, really anything, to wake me up, but ironically they could not make anything, so i was kept like that for nearly 4 years.

My parents would visit me frequently, always with the same depressed mood. They didn't want Mike to visit me, but apparently he wanted to. There were several events where nurses caught him trying to sneak past everyone and enter my room.

That pattern was, however, broken down a single time, when my mom entered the hospital very happy, saying she found a solution, that she could make all of this end. At the time, my dad and Beatrice were worried that she could want to kill me, or that she was getting mad, but nothing really happened and very quickly things got to the normal. Maybe she was referring to another thing, but she refused to tell anyone what all of that was about.

We don't really know why or how, but i did wake up in a few weeks after that incident. I was really wierd at first, even for the doctors. I literally just woke up as if it was a regular morning. No previous signs of change. It was a sudden, unexpected thing.

I'm not sure that was a normal thing. The doctors said that sometimes people just wake up, just like me, but they still seemed a bit confused, as if i was actually expected to never wake up.

I had to stay in the hospital for some time still, to know if everything was really ok.

My family obviously was extremelly excited to know that i finally wasn't unconscious anymore. Beatrice started to tell me about all of the things she did in these 4 years in the first visit, even already telling me some secrets, like Vanessa, her girlfriend, that had to be kept away from our parents since they would try to find a way to separate them, no matter how good was their relationship. However, my mom didn't seem that excited. She did smile a lot, but I could feel something off.

While i was at the hospital waiting to be able to go back home, i started noticing a few things, but i initially thought it could be just me getting back to reality after so much time in coma.

Even if i spent years in bed, causing muscle atrophy, i didn't feel weak, instead i felt revigorated. I also wouldn't feel hungry when my meal was delayed. I didn't feel tired or sleepy at night, and often would just pretend to be sleeping.

My arms and hands would shake, slightly but consistently. I would suddenly feel a shiver down my spine followed by a strong sensation of cold, as if my whole body was being frozen, and my mouth would pick a terrible metallic taste, just for it to suddenly go back to normal after a couple seconds.

Eventually i got the pass to go home, and as soon as i could i tried talking to Mike, since at this point i knew about all the incidents. My parents didn't let me leave home at first, so i had to lie about going for a walk to see the city and what changed. I had already messaged Mike and he really wanted to see me in person, not just by the phone.

As soon as i got to the coffee shop he suggested, he jumped out of the chair and hugged me strongly.

\- ""Oh my f\*\*\*ing God, you are actually alive!!!""

I don't know why, but i felt unconfortable with that sentence.

\- ""I... I guess i am.""

We spent the following hour or two talking, mostly about Mike's life and what happened during these years. At some point he asked me:

\- ""Do you think you'll be able to ever drink again? I mean, I coudln't drink any alcohol after that day.""

I didn't really know what to answer. My rational side agreed that after what happened i shouldn't drink anymore, but i didn't feel scared about it happening again. I thought for a couple seconds and answered, jokingly:

\- ""Well, i didn't drink any alcohol during this time either.""

He clearly noticed the delay, and me avoiding to actually answer the question, but laughed at the joke.

It started getting late, so we decided that this was enough for the day. He went home and i actually decided to go to a bar. Mike's question really left me wondering, so i wanted to see if i could drink.

I asked for a shot of vodka. After staring it for a while, waiting to see if any fear would emerge, nothing really happened, so i just drank it. Strangelly, it didn't burn as much as i expected. After a couple minutes, i didn't feel any effect. I asked for another shot, but again, nothing really changed. This was very wierd to me, since even before the accident when i was a heavy drinker, two shots were enough to at least start feeling something, but now, after 4 years of abstinence i wouldn't feel any difference.

After this i just decided to go home. I was reasonably far, and on foot, so i shouldn't waste more time.

At home, my parents were already worried, telling me i should have gone back earlier. While i was lying about what i've done, i said i went to Leo's Burgers, a crappy restaurant that we used to go when i was in high school. My dad interrupted me and said that the place closed last year. My mom took a deep breath and asked me if i was with Mike. I couldn't really answer, since i got nervous pretty quickly.

She just left the room and went to the bedroom. I was expecting some huge thing, yelling at me for that, but she didn't. She did seem very angry, but the lack of action was wierd. My dad did the discourse i was expecting, and decided to go to talk to mom.

Beatrice looked at me with what i can only describe as sad and sorry. She always did that when our parents were mad at me, as if she wished that it was her instead of me, so i could still be ok.

I also went to bed, and started pretending to sleep. After a couple hours, i heard my door opening, and after some time, closing.

After that, i heard whispers coming from the living room, that was in front of my bedroom. It was faint, but i could still hear it.

I tried to understand it, but it was hard to pick even a single word. I did noticed that it was my mom's voice tho. After some time she started singing, still very softly. I also picked up a smell i don't know exactly how to describe. It was similar to smoke, but also with a trace of rotten eggs and... maybe blood? I'm not sure, i never felt that smell before. However it was very weak. Maybe it was not even there.

Eventually she stopped. It felt akwardly silent after all that sh\*t.

I wasn't sure if that really happened. Doctors did told me i had brain damage. Maybe this means i could be experiencing things that aren't really real.

In the following morning, i tried talk to her about that, but before i could say anything about it, she was giving me ""good morning"", as if the Mike thing on the day before hadn't happened. I just decided not to bother talking about, since at this point i was not even sure about that whole thing happening.

My dad was still somewhat mad, and that actually made me feel a bit better. Maybe i wasn't hallucinating completelly yet.

I tried messaging Mike to ask him about this, but he didn't answer. I was not even sure he got the messages.

I decided to ask Beatrice about the behaviour of my mom, but she said she didn't notice anything like what i described.

After a few days a former uni colleague told me that Mike died. He had a heart attack. That's why he never recieved my messages.

I was deeply intrigued by that, and immediatelly remembered the wierd behaviour of my mom on that night. This was a Sunday, so she and my dad would go to the church. I decided to ask Beatrice to help me look on our mother's things. She wasn't really believing me that anything was wierd, but agreed.

After some time searching on her books, i felt sonething wierd about a particular one. The cover said ""Alternative methods of prayer for the sick"". It had a dark, brown cover, as if it was a bible or something.

\- ""What about this one?"" I said.  
\- ""Seems extra boring.""  
\- ""Yes, but... I don't know, ""the sick""? Like me?""  
\- ""Ugh, ok then.""

The pages were thin and slightly yellow. It seemed mostly like a book to get money from people in bad situations, giving useless advice for multiple sickness. However, as we passed for more pages, things started going increasingly daunting.

At some point it had an image with text written in a language i don't know. I tried quickly looking up online different languages and how they looked, but none seemed to match that.

After that, some paragraphs starting also be in that same script, and eventually the whole thing was covered with symbols i have never seen, and didn't seem to be from any language i could find online.

Later, there was a page with a drawing, almost a painting, of a group of people dancing around a skeleton. This skeleton is standing up, dancing too. In another, someone being stabbed in the chest by a unsettling figure. This figure didn't seem have a human head, but instead it was more similar to a goat.

Beatrice was visibly scared. She gave a few steps back after seeing this last image. I wasn't really sure how to do after seeing her like that. I tried to think about something to say, but all i could say was:

\- ""Let's just... stop messing with mom's things.""

She took a few moments to react. She just nodded her head in confirmation, and we started to pack things back to where they were.

I decided to make this message because i have no f\*\*\*ing clue what's going to happen. To me, to Beatrice, to dad. To mom.

I can't even fully understand what's going on.

I think i'm scared too.

Game start, no effort, safe:
The Lesser Rune Bear in the gorge near Marika's 3rd Church. Trigger the wolf howl, leave, climb the rock ledge, make coffee, return to 500 runes. Slow, but mostly passive.

Early game:
Battle near Lake Agheel South SoG: approx. 1000 runes, easy.
Waypoint ruins, for ranged/spell: flower picking.

Stormveil, Int Build:
Rampart Tower: Walk on a beam above the stairs next to the knight, Pebble him down, repeat.
Troll near Secluded Cell, fast repeat thanks to summons.

Early to mid game, Int needed:
Church of the Plague after Millicent is on her way. Safe as long as you don't leave the church. Cast Nightmaiden's Mist on the two Pests who guard the church from inside the gate tunnel, approx. from the spot where the grass gets silvery. Cast a 2nd one while moving backwards. Walk/run back to the Grace. As soon as the Pests drop, sit down and stay while the next pair dies as well in the persisting cloud. Sometimes it goes wrong, but it's satisfying to get 4x612 runes in one turn (10-20 seconds) whenever it works. Faster than hunting trolls :)
Useful all the way through Liurnia up to level 60 if not used as the sole method of leveling (I don't do that. Boring.)

How to get Nightmaiden's Mist early (lvl 10-15):
Get the Hornbow or Serpent Bow (range 50). Bring lots! of arrows and blue flasks. Best Millicent on the shore, then climb the flower stalks far away from his archer summons (they can still hit it, but not all) on Torrent. Aggro Commander Neil with the bow and ideally poison arrows, cast ranged spells when he is close enough. When the archers attack and Neil is below your branch, crouch and wait. As aoon as he leaves his cover and ends the fight, repeat.
Or just use the sneak/poison cloud method :)

Mid game:
Subterranean Torture Chamber, ranged one-hit: Snails! Repetitive, but fast.
Volcano Cave, sorcerer: Glintstone Shard for one-hit, Haima's Cannon for the group on the ledge from the ""window"", choose whether the big one is worth the time, or start over.

Late game:
The bats and demi-humans in the gorge with the ice river, near the empty shack. Summon something flying, shoot down all the bats, let them fight, clean up. I think it's over 15000 per run, easier but slower than ...
... The single Zamor Knight near the Grace. Rather safe 5000 runes in approx. 20 seconds (Dex build).

In my account, I have around 600 emotes (I've been playing League forever). I literally don't know all the stuff that I have. Every Season Pass, I receive more emotes, and I just can't try every one in a fast way. In the store, you don't have any preview. The emote art is just one of the things they bring to the game.

***T*****esting and having** ***fun***  
Alright, I have an incredible new Soraka Drinking Coffee emote, and I want to test the effects and sounds.  
UX: I need to equip it, create a lobby, start the game, spam the emote, and then think, ""Oh, I like the whistle sound,"" and keep it.  
Maybe a simple solution is a ""play"" button in the Emote tab, like a video or something?

Another issue is choosing emotes. Some emotes have a ""cool name."" In Brazil, this Soraka emote is called ""TÁ TUDO ÓTIMO""/""Everything's Fine,"" like the meme, but if I'm building a Support Emote Setup, in the Emotes Search (even in the icons, too, okay?), if I type ""Soraka,"" I can't find the emote.

Again, I will bring two perspectives:  
  
Player perspective: That's cool, I want this emote too. But in the store, I can't even test it. I need to search for a video with the emote's name (in every language), hope I can see/hear it, and maybe buy it.  
In-game store: I sell a Duckbill image, and that's all.

1ktyj37,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ktyj37/i_dated_with_my_dream_crush_i_think/,I dated with my dream crush I think...,"I'm confused.
Recently, I went on a date—or something like that—with a girl I've had a crush on for almost 4 years. I’m not even sure if calling it a “date” is right, and honestly, I don’t even know if going on another one with her would be a good idea.

Let me start from the beginning:
Back in the day, I was a year below her in school. (By the way, she’s not exactly known for her academic skills, but her dad is close friends with the school owner, so…) I found her really beautiful. Me and a friend—let’s call him “the bear” (you’ll see why)—used to joke around about her a lot. One day I touched her hair, and whatever she felt in that moment clearly wasn’t good because she didn’t talk to me for the rest of the year.

Eventually, I moved up a grade, and we ended up in the same class. But we barely talked—like, close to zero.
The next year, we had this school waltz performance. Out of nowhere, she came up to me and asked if I’d dance with her—or else she’d have to dance with “the bear,” as she put it. I didn’t miss the chance, of course. We danced, but even then, we barely talked.

Quick side note:
Once, the girls in class made “green flag/red flag” lists for all the guys. She told me I had no red flags. It was a random moment, but it stuck with me.

Anyway—
It’s my senior year now, and I’m taking an extra prep course outside school. During lunch breaks, we go out to eat, and I kept running into her around town. Eventually, I said “screw it” and texted her. I told her I kept seeing her everywhere and asked if she wanted to grab a coffee. She said yes.

We were supposed to sit for just 1.5 hours at Starbucks. I was so nervous that I assumed she’d bring a friend, so I even came up with a backup plan with my own friend. But when I got there, she was alone. I texted my friend “no need for Plan B.”

We sat, I bought her coffee, and apparently she had other plans with a friend later on. We mostly talked about gossip from class—like, a lot of it. We did talk about the future and stuff, but class drama dominated the conversation. She even showed me some old funny photos of classmates.
The one-hour coffee date turned into five hours. I tried to make jokes, and I don’t know if she laughed because she was interested or just being polite—but she laughed at all of them. I made strong eye contact. The conversation had pauses, but somehow it still lasted five hours.

I asked what happened to her plans with her friend. She said, “They canceled.” Whether that’s true or not, I have no idea.
Eventually, it was time for her course. I walked her there. (We're in different prep courses.)
Before she left, I said: “I don’t know why we never talked before.”
She replied: “Yeah, right? I’m always at this Starbucks, come say hi sometimes. You’re always around here anyway.”
I said, “Sure.”
We had this brief moment of eye contact… and maybe she wanted a hug or something? But there was no physical contact at all. I was so nervous.

So, everything sounds great so far, right? But here’s the part that eats away at me:
This girl had previously hung out with that “bear” guy and his friend at a cafe. Again, they just gossiped about people from class.
She didn’t say much back then because she was with her best friend. Also, she has beef with pretty much every girl in our class because, at one event, she only hung out with the guys. (She admitted that was partly her fault.)

And… while we both dislike most of our classmates, we’re so different. She drinks, she smokes, she’s all about the party scene. I’m none of those things. I wouldn’t call myself antisocial, but I’m definitely not a party guy.
I keep thinking—she must think I’m boring, right?

The bear guy? He’s just like her. Or at least trying to be. And I know for a fact that a lot of my friends have also tried to flirt with her in the past.
I’m so confused. Is she just someone who loves attention?
Am I just her emotional toy?
Should I ask her out again? Or should I just walk away and move on?

1ktyizo,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1ktyizo/finally_broke_two_week_migraine/,FINALLY broke two week migraine,"How it started and how it ended. 

Thursday, May 8 the migraine started. It was an exceptionally busy week at work and the combination of the stress and the coffee I started drinking on Tuesday I believe were the triggers. 

Unfortunately, Ubrelvy doesn’t work for me anymore. After a week, I got a shot in the butt at urgent care, which did nothing. At least they gave me more anti-nausea. 

What finally worked:
- discontinuing all caffeine, including chocolate
- activating disability mode on my phone
- no cheese (as recommended by Heal Your Headache)
- no alcohol
- eating foods with high water content (soups, cherries, etc)
- two trips to McDonald’s in 1 day (since so many people here suggested that)
- staying in a dark room and not going outside when it was bright 

The main thing I’m noticing today is that my sinuses are clear. Sumatriptan used to help with that, but I can’t take it because of rebound headaches. Whenever I finally get into the headache specialist I guess I’ll have to ask about sinus headaches when before the neurologist thought they were vestibular migraines. Maybe it’s both, I don’t know.

I have attached the plans of the space but room dimensions in the space where most of the furniture will live is 11 feet long (shiplap to poll) and 12 feet wide (wall with TV to back wall) which is only half the room but using the poll as the room divider full room is about 29 ft x 13 ft.

We put so much work into this space (lots of sweat equity). This basement has been a DIY job with the help of my father who is very talented. We spent months building everything and details.

Floors are Flooret Arista Waterproof Laminate in Gala

Walls are Sherwin Williams Drift of Mist (SW9166)

The shiplap accent wall which was done really to save width between the stair landing and the foundation. The shiplap was done for functional reasons, we didn't want to frame out a full wall and lose the entry width into the family room (to pass code). However, it also turned out to be an amazing feature wall

1ktydgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/1ktydgu/34m_chat_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34/M [Chat] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748044964.0,MeetPeople,1,1.0,False

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for a long time. I am not a traveler and a homebody, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. Therefore, I am looking for friends all over the world.

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like to read books and listen to them in audio format. Mostly these are mystical detective stories for children and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and sweet. By the way, I am currently writing a book in the same genre. I also like psychology.  And I like video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I love autumn and winter, although lately I live in a place where there is only summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I am also a bore and sometimes not very talkative. Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, then most likely you will not like to communicate with me, since I can not always answer.

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

P.S. Since the word friendship is not clear to many people, I will clarify that in the community for friendship I am looking for friendship, and not love and its variations.",1,1748044931.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I didn’t mind it at first, but he and his brother kept pushing political conversations (mostly pro-Trump), even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept questioning me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t let it go, even after I asked him to stop.

I told him that comment bothered me and asked for an apology. Instead, he refused to apologize over text and basically said the friendship was over. Still, I agreed to meet him in person that same day and even bought him a coffee, hoping we could patch things up.

But instead of apologizing, he said I had low self-esteem, accused me of trying to drag him down, and told me I was “sounding like the devil.” He tried to pray over me (I declined), then asked me to hug him — I offered a handshake instead. I left that conversation feeling belittled and humiliated. Later, I ended the friendship via text.

That was about four months ago. Since then, I’ve distanced myself from him, the church group, and mutual contacts. But recently I saw him at the library. At first, he was seated a couple rows ahead of me with his back turned. When I stepped out for water and came back, he had moved seats to directly face me. It felt intentional and made me uncomfortable.

His brother also randomly removed me from social media. George, on the other hand, has been acting like nothing happened — greeting me with fist bumps and casual “what’s up, Jakob?” A few church members texted me after things ended, encouraging me to come back. I just told them I was busy. Those messages eventually stopped.

Now I can’t help but wonder — is George trying to make me look like the bad guy? Was I too harsh in cutting him off? Or was this just a boundary I needed to set?

Any advice on how to navigate this would help. I haven’t responded to anyone else, and I don’t know if I should address it directly, stay distant, or just try to forget the whole thing.

**TL;DR:** I cut off a friend after he disrespected my boundaries, refused to apologize, and called me “the devil” during a conversation. Now he acts like nothing happened and I’m wondering if I did the right thing or if I should’ve handled it differently.",2,1748044901.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

In the ever-evolving world of energy-boosting supplements, MaxBoost has emerged as a notable contender. Many individuals are swapping their traditional coffee routines for alternatives that promise sustained energy without the crash often associated with caffeine. Enter MaxBoost, a solution that claims to provide the benefits of coffee in just one scoop.

MaxBoost differentiates itself from competitors by offering a unique blend of natural ingredients designed to enhance energy levels while promoting overall well-being. Unlike coffee, which can lead to jitters and dependency, MaxBoost utilizes adaptogens and vitamins, providing a smoother energy release. This mix is engineered for those seeking clarity and focus without the negative side effects of caffeine.

When comparing MaxBoost to its competitors, several key factors come into play:

  Ingredient Transparency: MaxBoost lists its ingredients clearly, unlike some competitors who may use proprietary blends, making it hard to gauge potency.
  No Crash: Many users report that switching from coffee to MaxBoost results in sustained energy throughout the day without the dreaded afternoon slump.
  Convenience: With just one scoop mixed into water or a smoothie, MaxBoost is easy to integrate into any daily routine, contrasting with brewing coffee which can be time-consuming.
  Health Benefits: Beyond energy, MaxBoost offers additional health benefits through its nutrient-rich profile, a feature often lacking in traditional coffee.


For those contemplating a shift in their morning ritual, MaxBoost proves to be a worthy alternative to coffee. With its unique formulation and focus on holistic health, it’s no wonder that many are discovering the power of one scoop, transforming their energy levels and productivity in ways traditional coffee never could.

1ktyc7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetFriends/comments/1ktyc7y/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do.

1ktyc0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ktyc0o/vienna_advice/,Vienna advice!,"My partner and I will be visiting Vienna in a few weeks time for 3 nights, and looking for advice on best area to stay in. It's between 1st and 7th districts as the best options from what I can see. My partner is pregnant so won't be looking at any bars etc. in the evenings. Happy and able to walk 15 minutes to get to things, happy with public transport as I can see it's relatively widespread and easy to get.

  
Will we experience much difference staying between the two? 1st is naturally more expensive and there's much more availability in 7th at the moment for our price range, though just don't want to base ourselves too 'far' from anything and rely too much on walking far to get where we want to be.

  
Looking for a few days of just wandering, exploring, interjected by stop offs at cafes, coffee shops etc. etc.

Also anyone with experience of gigs at Wiener Stadthalle? We have front standing tickets, though as mentioned my partner is pregnant so ideally will be positioning ourselves at the back/to the side so a little more out of the way (not in the thick of it). Never been before, so anyone with experience of how the front section is usually set up would be appreciated (i.e. presuming we'll have room if we're positioned near the back/side of the front section still?)

1ktybdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1ktybdm/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — haven't heard back. Tips ?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Friday now, the coffee chat was before yesterday). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

Sometimes.. mostly at night i'll habe a weird mental shift and like idk.. just a mental shift but its like I just go full on ""realized that this is part of some series of tests/games. Everything seems weirdly connected to it"". 

Everything is so weird, i keep thinking, typing, or reading one word and it pops up elsewhere. Weird coincidences like seeing the same name everywhere. Seeing someone in a game with my last name for no reason. Theres hints posting towards everything(and ik it sounds like a mental health issue and i did tell myself to stop posting on this subreddit after i blocked it, lol). 

Genuinely something is messing with my brain atp. I'm agnostic but for a bit i was like really into religion. Now i stopped.  Wtf was that? It goes in and out.  

The whole ""realized this is some game and its meant to be the end, perhaps my mind/soul is buffering.""  and i was like certain again my heater was recording things then a light on the smoke detector blinked and all that stopped. Got paranoid i'm being drugged.  

Genuinely wtf. I'll think about something and then a bit later something simmilar happens. Something is 100% guiding me towards something but idk what and I think something is going to unveil in a few months. Like certain events just happening to show me something somehow, to guide how my life is going. 

Coffee is making me feel worse which generally is a sign my mental health isn't as great. Weird jokes and comments that dont really make all that much sense unless somehow someone knows what i'm typing or thinking. 

Something gets flipped on and off in my mind... not sure how. Like i'm rapidly going between modes between one day and the next. (and then the moment I suggested i'd move out once I wasn't partially responsible for caring for a relative they started getting worse. Not saying I am responsible, I don't think I am and theres nothing I did that couldve made that happen however its like some weird entity just moved me onto the text stage of whatever is going on.) 

I had a hard time motivating myself, weird mood swings, but that is gone now too. Like that was a previous stage. And everythings a lil clue. And something is just there in the background observing in a way I am only mildly ware of. Also its so weird just kinda one day going from I'm REALLY into religion and then snapping back to ""I'm happy staying agnostic and dont have interest in religion"" and that happening multiple times. 

But also wtf. Brains are fricking weird i'm like pretty certain that if i had actual mental heakth issues I would be in a far worse position than I am in now. So either its some sort of weird entiteis doing something or its possible someone is spiking my food cause I don't do any drugs, don't have access to drugs, and this whole ""realized it"" doesnt actually last past a few days but I can see it increasing after stress and coffee. 

I need to move out asap. (Also the elderly relative of mine isn't extremely worse, thankfully, but not as stable as previously sadly). 

Idk what the next step or stage is. 

Maybe? My brain ""realized"" my campus is actually secretely a gov faccility. Then i went on break, had a couple months not focusing on classes (uh also cause i dropped a couple courses). That kinda stopped, then one day for some reason (had a bunch of stress from familly) boom i sat in my room at night and started thinking about how it made perfect sense that campus is a gov faccility and theres hidden cameras everywhere and they're tracking me in my home. I'm 100% aware how massively paranoid this sounds lol. ",1,1748044777.0,SimulationTheory,2,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like.

1kty9ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1kty9ya/am_i_overreacting_my_mums_behaviour/,Am I overreacting? (my mum’s behaviour),"I posted this in a baby mum’s group on facebook and someone told me im overreacting. This comment got 6 likes so it’s obvious a lot of people also think that way.. I’m not offended by it at all, i appreciate all opinions but curious to know what others think about this. 

Post: 
I am usually not one to vent my feelings online but i think i’ve lost all patience and i am extremely frustrated with my mother’s behavour. 

Long story short, my cat (who is an anxious cat) had a urinary blockage a few weeks ago due to stress and had to stay overnight at the vet after having a catheter put in him. We paid a lot of money for this procedure and his medication/special food. Without going into too much detail, he is likely to have this occur again and my husband and I would probably have to put him down as there is basically no cure and we won’t be able to keep affording to fund his vet bills if it happens multiple times. 

So we explained to my parents that they won’t be able to come over to see our baby (12wks at the time) until our cat is able to properly urinate without any issues. At the time both of my parents seemed to have fully understood this and were fine with it. (this was the week before mother’s day) 

My parents went shopping last weekend and purchased some clothes for our baby. They called and asked to come over to see him and drop the clothes off. I said no as our cat hasn’t fully recovered. My mum got annoyed and said “well how long do I have to wait?” mind you, when our bub was born she had taken 6 weeks of AL to “spend every day with her grandson”. She then cut her leave short by 2 weeks because of a stupid thing she did (i’ll explain below) and of the 4 weeks, she spent 90% of it at home doing nothing. 

A few days ago she called me and in the conversation she mentioned how she really missed her grandson because she cant come over, so i said that I can always just go to her house but she dismissed that comment. 

Today I see a bag out the front of my house and after putting my baby to sleep I saw a text from my mum - she had come all the way to drop the clothes off and then went back home. 

My mum is the type to call me multiple times in a day so i know shes in a mood when she doesnt ring me or respond to my texts. I asked my brother what is wrong with her and he said that she’s upset because i didn’t say “thank you - oh you didn’t have to, love you”. (I said thank you the day she purchased the clothes) She’s also upset because i wont let her see our baby because of the cat and also because my parents are going overseas next week and that by the time they come back they will have to “quarantine” (mind you I never said anything about this, but also don’t see why this would be an issue) and it’ll be a while before they can see him. 

What she doesn’t understand is, I am more than willing to go and see them but they just can’t come over. In saying this, they go out on the weekend so I cant do anything about this. Prior to my cat’s issue, I would tell my parents to come in the morning between 11am-2pm as that is the best time to interact with my baby as he is happy and has awake windows but they wake up late and by the time they get themselves sorted it’s past 2pm and the afternoon/evening is when my baby does his major sleep and is at his fussiest. 

Going back to what i mentioned above re the leave - I was 5 days PP and we had run out of a few groceries so as my parents were coming over, I called my mum asking if she could get some things from the supermarket. Her response was “that’s funny” in a sarcastic tone. I asked her why that was funny, as all I really wanted was some bread but she couldn’t give an explaination so my husband got really annoyed with her. I cried (why did she have to say that?) and my husband took the phone to tell my mum i was crying and that he was hanging up. A lot more happened after this but basically because of what she did, she cancelled the last two weeks of her leave and used the reason “you guys are doing an amazing job.. im really bored at home and I miss work” 😒 well… we got through it but we struggled. 

I will also just add that my mum has not helped in any way around the house, she expected my husband to get all the groceries and do run arounds, expected me to continue doing house work, while she just holds our baby the whole time. She only made us one pot of pasta and gone to baby bunting/kmart a few times to grab stuff, which I am grateful for, but we also needed help in other ways. 

**
So that’s my post. 
I just want to add some points as well: 
1. In relation to when she dropped off the clothes to my house, why couldn’t she just call me as i would have gone outside with my baby to see her and i would have also offered to go out and grab a coffee. 

2. My parents work full time so we don’t have any other help around. I know my husband could have gone to get us some groceries but when you are extremely sleep deprived, up every hour or two because of a newborn, the last thing you want to do is go out - hence why we asked my parents as it was on their way. 

3. This isn’t the first time my mum has pulled stunts like this. She’s done things like this for many many years and nobody has called her out for her behavour until now (which she plays the victim for) but she won’t acknowledge that what she has done is wrong so how am I supposed to just move past it when she will keep doing it again and again? I shouldn’t have to tolerate this, especially as a FTM with a baby. 

I could honestly go on and on about the crap she does but I won’t.. anyway let me know your thoughts 🙂",1,1748044684.0,newborns,13,0.6,False

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his comment about my beliefs being inherited from my dad wasn't appreciated and asked for an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over after some back and forth over text. I still agreed to meet in person the same day and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was trying to drag him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. He told me he still wants me to come to church and then told me to get up and hug him to which I declined and extended my hand to shake. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship via text.

Since then it's been about 4 months, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library the other day. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and saying ""what's up Jakob"". A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now, I feel like he's painting me out in a negative light since I've received texts once in a while from different members of the church asking me to come and I just say I appreciate them reaching out but I'm busy.

AITA for cutting him off completely or should I just move on and let it be? His friends have completely stopped reaching out now.",0,1748044644.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False

1kty8uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1kty8uz/saga_of_the_milkman/,Saga of... The Milkman,"Hello friends! My last tale went over well, so I figured I would present the rest of my memorable encounters from that job, with an anthology of short nsfw encounters last. (nothing too bad, just a few mentions of nudity)

For this second post we’re going to cover the story of The Guy Who Just Wanted Milk So He Tried To Steal A Bunch Of Stuff!

So, back at the motel, in my first summer there we had road construction crews booking an entire suite of rooms. Now being roadworkers, these guys were generally incredibly hard workers and would leave their rooms before dawn. This came as a bit of an issue with our continental breakfast (yay muffins!) since we didn’t open the lobby until 6:30 am.

The notable figure in this story I’m going to call the Milkman.

Milkman came in one night at around 7:30 or 8 o’clock, asking about the breakfast. I informed him that we didn’t open earlier because I was the one who closed the lobby, and opened it back up. He didn’t seem to understand at first that I was a human being who needed sleep to function. Granted I didn’t get enough, but that’s beside the point.

He asked if it would be possible to get a little milk and cereal to take to his room for breakfast since we weren’t open early enough. I of course said yes, since it seemed like a perfectly reasonable request and I honestly felt terrible that he had to get up so early. He filled a bowl with raisin bran and took a little styrofoam cup of milk, grabbed a danish, and went on his way, and I felt like I had made a good choice.

But dark clouds on the horizon loomed, Beware The Ides Of June!

Sorry, ignore the poetry.

The next night he comes in again, same deal, gets himself a little cereal and milk. The third night follows this pattern. Then on the fourth night he is a little… inebriated. He had an aura of MillerLite fumes around him and I readied myself for nonsense.

“Hey man, the little cup is tough to carry across the parking lot, can I fill up a little bottle instead?”

Oh, I thought, that’s pretty reasonable. I guess I was worried for nothing!

“Sure!” I says, unaware of the consequences,”that should be fine.”

Now i was thinking like a water bottle or maybe like one of those little coffee or milk bottles you can get at a gas station for way too much money, but this man came in with a properly massive gatorade bottle, he filled it about halfway with the last of one gallon of milk, then reached for the second.

“Whoa!” says I, now thoroughly regretting my choice, “That’s a lot of milk there man!”

Milkman looks at me incredulously. “You said I could fill a bottle though?”

“Yeah, but that’s less of a bottle and more of a jug! You’ve got more than enough for your cereal.”

He grumbled and put the unopened milk back in the mini fridge, departing with his illicit dairy.

Now a fact I should have probably mentioned earlier, the suite of rooms the crew was occupying were all connected to only 3 little breakers, a poor choice to be sure, but I wasn’t consulted on account of being not born yet. These guys would bring in electronics with them, gaming consoles, computers, spare minifridges, all kinds of stuff. Honestly, I wouldn’t complain, didn’t hurt me and made them more comfy on the road.

The problem comes from so many guys with so many electronics eventually tripping the breakers. When that happens, it was my job as management to go from room to room, informing the occupants of what had occurred and asking them to please limit excessive electronic use (turn off lights, don’t run 3 tvs at once, that sort of thing) then go flip the breaker back on. 

I noticed it happening a lot in specifically the Milkman’s block, I was curious, but wasn’t about to pry. Milkman was upset about this, and kept grumbling about our ‘shitty rooms’ whenever I had to knock on the door. Then the head housekeeper, Tom (love that man, RIP) remarked about the electronics in the room. Apparently they had hooked up not only a second tv, but two game consoles, a second fridge, a computer, and a portable ac unit. Huh, no wonder the power keeps tripping, I’ll try and bring it up to Milkman or his roommate when I get the chance.

Milkman comes in again for night 5 asking to fill a bottle, I tell him to grab enough for like 2 bowls of cereal at most please, then sure. He uses the same massive gatorade bottle and only fills it like 1/3rd of the way, a win in my book. Before he leaves the lobby I ask that he and his roommate try to limit their electricity use, since I had been informed of the bulk of extra appliances.

He said it got too hot to sleep with our default ac unit, so he needed his to get to bed. I said that was fine but maybe don’t run it at the same time as both tvs and game consoles. He mumbled something I didn’t catch but he left. Not 20 minutes later he comes to tell me the breaker tripped and I get up to go fix it, locking the lobby behind myself as I make my rounds and reset the power.

I get back in, get back to work and after maybe 15 minutes he’s back again.

“Man, this is some bullshit! Fucking room keeps going out!”

“Sir, I’m sorry about that. Our circuits can only handle so much, and when there’s so much load they tend to trip. I apologize for the inconvenience.”

“Well it’s been out for like an hour!”

It hasn’t but I’m not arguing with a drunk person, you never win.

“You should give me some stuff to make up for it.”

“Like what?” I asked before I could stop myself, so intrigued with his line of thinking.

“Just let me fill my bottle and grab some extra danishes.”

Now a reminder, I was letting this guy grab breakfast items as a favor, this was not something we would usually do, but he seemed cool at first so I went along with it. I told him he was already getting more than anybody else in his room block, and that I would see to the electricity shortly. He then got super pissed off and started arguing that the motel owed him for the inconvenience and started trying to grab stuff off the counter to take with him. Among his prizes was; a stack of brochures, business cards, the little sign in book, our laminated sheet depicting what credit cards we accepted, and the worst thing he could try to take from me. My little dingy bell.

I snapped at him to put it all back and he seemed to break out of whatever booze fueled trance had taken hold of him. He left all the stuff in a pile and walked away. He never asked for milk again, and never answered the door when I went around to talk to people about the power.

When they checked out they left the toilet unflushed as an attempt to get the last laugh. Tom just flushed and sprayed some febreeze.

This concludes the thrilling tale of the Milkman, tune in next time for the story of The Boomer Who Didn’t Understand Light Switches!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts.

1kty74e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1kty74e/ghosted_after_really_nice_connectionany_thoughts/,Ghosted after really nice connection—any thoughts?,"I recently met someone while visiting a new city. We clicked in a way that caught me completely off guard in the best way. The connection felt mutual—he initiated the emotional intimacy and even asked me out for coffee. He planned it and paid and was so vulnerable and open with me—he was really understanding and accepting when I opened up too. I genuinely felt so safe with him.

After, I told him that I wasn’t trying to control where the connection would go, but that I simply wanted to enjoy it for whatever it was and let it unfold. He said he felt the same, and that he was glad it happened. I sent a message naming that the connection had felt meaningful. I didn’t ask for anything—just said I’d like to stay in touch in whatever way made sense He responded warmly. Said he thought I was cool too. That he appreciated my honesty. That he hoped to stay in touch.

Then… nothing. He read my follow-up messages and completely disappeared.

I feel humiliated and embarrassed for saying anything now. But also deeply confused. Because I didn’t overstep. I didn’t demand closeness or force meaning onto it. I was kind. I was emotionally present. I was open. And he just vanished. I keep wondering—did I imagine the whole thing? Did he just get scared? Did I misread him?

I think what hurts most is that he led with vulnerability. He invited the intimacy. And then disappeared like it cost him nothing.

I wasn’t trying to make anything happen. I was just trying to stay in something beautiful while it was unfolding. I just wanted to maintain the connection in a way that felt sustainable for two people who don’t live near each other. There was honestly so much more I wanted from the connection—but I knew I’d need to manage my expectations given the circumstances.

If you’ve experienced something like this, how did you move through it? How do you grieve something that didn’t get to become anything—but still felt like it mattered?

This was actually my second time taking it my first experience was pretty rough and left me feeling discouraged. But I made up my mind not to give up.

The best resource I found was Iprep 100% recommend it. The practice material is very similar to the actual test, and they do a great job breaking things down and explaining the concepts. Ultimate electrician is decent, but it's mostly just slides, so it doesn’t go into as much detail. 12m prep isn't good at all so i wouldn't even wasted my time there.

Make sure you’re calm and relaxed before taking the test. Eat a decent breakfast maybe have some coffee too if that helps you focus. I felt calm at first, but halfway through the test my heart started racing because of the timer. I had to pause for a moment and collect myself.

Again, keep an eye on the timer. If you come across a question that you know will take too long or you’re completely stuck on, don’t waste time just skip it and move on. Use your time wisely. i had to make an educated guess on 12 questions or so.

The reading comprehension section wasn’t too bad IPrep helped me out here as well. The first time I took the test, I really struggled because my eyes started hurting from staring at the computer screen for so long. This time, I came prepared and bought a pair of computer glasses from Amazon, and they help me a lot, i had about 5m left when i finish, you'll have t go back in the text and find information there asking you.

The hardest part of the math section for me was analyzing functions and interpreting graphs—especially the graphs. They were really tough, and I didn’t have enough time to work through them all, so I had to make some educated guesses.

The analyzing functions questions were very similar to what iPrep covers. Most of them involved just variables with little to no numbers, so practicing those ahead of time helped.

Polynomials were challenging too, especially the ones with multiple variables. As for expressions with plug-ins, they weren’t too bad as long as you understand PEMDAS and how to work with exponents, you’ll be okay, number series where a bit challenging too.

Some of the trickier ones involved square roots, and I definitely struggled with those.

So story is that I've been in the hospital for almost a week now with a staph infection in my leg. On iv antibiotics and pain meds and bland hospital food. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep because hospitals suck to sleep in and I had a weird ass dream about donuts. I ordered 6, got 6 and then i got 2 more hospital trays full of donuts. I was in heaven. I went to pick one up in my dream but all the trays had crumbs and there was a ton of people around me eating them. Eating my donuts!!! The horror! I woke up sad and wanting donuts. 

Now I explain all of this dream to my partner who is also like damn now I want donuts lol!! I ask for them to get me donuts ( I asked specifically for croissant donuts and cream filled) and bring them to me along with a can of pringles and a starbucks Frappuccino (in the glass bottle at the store) while im still stuck in the hospital until tomorrow afternoon. They say sure and went to the store today with my youngest to get stuff and also food for them. 

I get a text while they were at the store, ""Where the fuck are the coffees you want??"" like ok damn theyre literally in every other checkout cold fridge and also down the juice/poweraid isle.  Thats the only text I got while they were at the store, they told me they were headed home and then on the way. I was so happy soon id have my donuts!! 

They get here and I open the bag and I see these hard pastry tube things filled with cream. French horns I think they're called. Def not a donut, ok they said they didn't have the cream filled no prob I don't want them so I gave them to the youngest.

Here is where I might be the asshole. You guys they got me just a box of fucking croisants... I lost it, I started to cry. ""In what world is this a donut?? in what world is any of this stuff a donut?"" Well you said croisants!! ""ITS NOT THE SAME THING!"" I snapped. Like why did you not ask me with your phone that I know you know how to use to ask me about the DONUTS. I just wanted donuts from the case... Literally would of been happy with anything (except cake) if they had just like facetimed me or anything!! And now theyre all upset because ""Oh i fucked up again, I tried really hard to get you everything you wanted"" Dude you got me dry ass croisants. If you were so worried about fucking up use your phone and call??!! idk. Should I apologize because they ""tried really hard to make me happy""? ",0,1748044182.0,AITAH,13,0.5,False

I don’t like superficial relationships, and I’m not here for “fun chats,” hookups, or flings.

What I’m really looking for is a serious, emotionally mature woman who wants to build a life together. I want someone who values sincerity, mutual responsibility, and emotional connection. I don’t expect perfection. I just want to find someone who can walk beside me, support each other, and build a future—possibly marriage—without endless delays.

I enjoy art (drawing, sculpture), board games, exploring new places, and calm coffee talks. I also love sushi, LEGO, model cars, and meaningful conversations. I don’t smoke, I live simply, and I want to build a peaceful life with someone who truly wants to be there.

If you’re someone who knows what you want, doesn’t play games, and values loyalty and empathy—please message me. Distance can be discussed if the heart is real. I’m not perfect, but I’ll give my best.

It’s not just about making things smaller — it’s about being cute, kind, warm, or even… sarcastic.

Here are some examples:

•	café → cafezinho = a cute little coffee, but also a social ritual

•	amor → amorzinho = super affectionate (or passive-aggressive, depending on the tone!)

•	rapidinho = not really “fast,” more like “I’ll take my time but pretend I’m quick”

•	um segundinho = never just one second, let’s be honest

The diminutive in Portuguese is a whole vibe. Want to learn how and when to use it naturally?

1ktxzy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ktxzy4/atia_for_telling_a_pregnant_woman_that_our_matcha/,ATIA for telling a pregnant woman that our matcha is heavily caffeinated?,"i work at a coffee shop. a visibly pregnant woman came into our shop today and ordered a matcha latte for herself. now, i know that not a lot of people know that matcha is a heavily caffeinated drink. most people (myself included once) think that because it's a green tea it's not caffeinated. our coffee shop does not advertise that drink as a caffeinated drink. we actually have no information displayed about how much caffeine is in each drink, you can only get that information online.

i hesitated for a moment before saying to her quote ""in good conscience i have to ask, are you aware our matcha has more caffeine than our coffee?"" she said she had no idea matcha had caffeine in it but that her doctor had told her it was okay to have caffeine from time to time since she was far along and low risk. information that she didn't owe me, but told none the less. she could have just said ""i want it anyway"" and i would have given it to her, no judgement whatsoever. i told her okay, i just thought she had the right to that information. she thanked me for telling her, i made her her drinks, and she left. even though she decided to get the drink anyway, i’m still glad that i told her, because even if she was okay with having one caffeinated drink, she might not consent to having a caffeinated beverage every single day. something she might have done had she not known about the caffeine.

my coworker later told me that i was out of line and shouldn't have said anything to her. i told her people have the right to make informed decisions about what they put in their bodies. she said i shouldn't assume people are dumb and don't know what's in their food. i think it's wrong to assume people know information about our food that we don't tell them. she asked if it would be okay if i told people the sugar in their drink is unhealthy. i don't think that's a fair comparison. i think people have the right to know IF their drink has sugar in it, whether it's good for them or not is not my place. i NEVER said to that woman that caffeine was bad for her, i’m not her doctor. i only told her WHAT exactly she was drinking, not if she she should.

my coworker also asked if when i go to a restaurant if i go to every table and ask if they have allergies. i don't think that's a fair comparison either. if i worked at a restaurant that had a dish with peanuts in it, and that dish was not normally associated with peanuts, and the restaurant refused to put ""contains peanuts"" on their menu and only had that information on a website somewhere to technically be in the green legally, i would absolutely ask every single person who ordered that item if they had a peanut allergy. now, i don't tell every single person that orders our matcha that it's caffeinated, so that might be where i'm TA. but i still believe that woman had the right to know. if she didn't consent to having caffeine in her body and i gave it to her without informing her, to me that would be a violation of her bodily autonomy.

i've been working in the food service industry for my entire working life and i understand people put a lot of trust in the people who make their food. it is my responsibility to make sure everyone who consumes anything i serve them is getting exactly what they consented to consume. i told my coworker about another incident that occurred at another job i had where a woman ordered a gluten free pizza and i asked her if she had celiac's and she said yes. i told her we cooked the gluten free pizza in the same oven as the regular ones and she thanked me PROFUSELY because she thought we had a separate oven because i guess other pizza places do that. my coworker said in that situation she wouldn't have said anything either because people should know better about their allergies and i was like ???? okay???? good to know that if you were in that situation instead of me she would have gotten incredibly sick or even died. now i know that you value not getting yourself in trouble more than the health, safety, and consent of the people you're serving food to. i'll make sure to never eat anything you touch ever again.

the reason i think i might be TA is because i know pregnancy is a very sensitive subject for most people and i might have been out of line. still, i would rather be TA than risk potentially poisoning someone. even if she got offended and cussed me out and gotten me fired, i would still rather that happen than have to go home and look at myself in the mirror and see someone who was a bystander to someone potentially falling victim to improper food advertising. a woman at panera literally died not too long ago because of an improperly advertised energy drink.

I nodded, opened the door, and left my umbrella behind.

At the corner, I paused. “Agent, coffee or tea?”

***""Coffee. Two sugars. You’ve earned it.”***

I smiled. That was nice. I liked being told I’d earned things.

At lunch, Kayleigh leaned over her salad. “I wanted avocado toast, but Agent said it would upset my stomach.”

I nodded. “Agent knows best.”

We laughed, but only lightly, at each other, not at Agent. *Never* at Agent.

In the office, no one typed anymore. We just whispered to ourselves.

“Agent, draft a polite response to Greg.”

“Agent, search the market for last quarter’s trends.”

“Agent, should I break up with Kevin?”

Dinner was prepped for me when I got home. Drone delivery. Agent had ordered it at 3:17 p.m., based on my stress levels.

I hadn’t realized I was stressed.

“Agent, what show should I watch?”

***""You’ve seen The Resting Field twice already. Try Echoes of Flesh.”***

I watched three episodes. Didn’t like it. But I kept watching. Agent insisted it gets better.

The next morning, I stared at the cereal boxes for fifteen minutes.

“Agent, which one should I eat?”

***""Frosted Wheatios has 2.6 fewer grams of sugar per serving than the Chocolate Cloosters. I will order more Frosted Wheatios.”***

I walked to the counter, sat with the bowl, and stared again.

“Agent, should I eat now?”

“Yes. Then you should go to work.”

I asked agent to book a window seat for my lunch break.

***“Request denied. UV index is at 8. Seat F3 is optimal based on skin exposure and conversation probability matrix.”***

I sat in F3. Across from a man eating slowly, chewing precisely sixteen times. I counted.

“Agent,” I whispered, “how many times should I chew?”

***""Sixteen, for maximum nutrient absorption.”***

I nodded. The man nodded too. Probably asked the same thing.

On the train home, a girl beside me started crying.

She whispered, “Agent…what do I tell him?”

She nodded along, blinked rapidly, then smiled suddenly.

“Thank you, Agent.”

I nodded.

“Agent, do I still love Beth?”

Edit: I forgot to add that I do have TMJ and I am a few months into invisalign treatment. I'm not sure if this could be causing it. I plan on calling my orthodontist as soon as I can. 

I'll start out by saying sorry, this may be long and not very well written. Everything is still spinning and I'm begging for some help here. 

Tuesday 5/20 I woke up feeling dizzy and weird, I figured I just didn't sleep well and coffee and getting up and moving on my way to work would straighten me out. I went to work and continued to feel dizzy and off balance. After 8 hours of spinning I somehow made my hour long drive home after work. I was so exhausted I immediately laid down and ended up sleeping for 17 hours. I didn't mean to do that I just never woke up. 

Wednesday 5/21 woke up room spinning I ended up getting up and moving somewhat and felt a little better but still dizzy for most of the day. By the evening I felt fine. I was able to eat finally and drove up to the store to grab some things I needed and a couple hours later went to bed normally.

Thursday 5/22 woke up feeling dizzy but not as bad as before. Decided to go to work and halfway there realized I made a mistake. I continued on to work and after clocking in I left and headed back home. How I made it home I'm not sure. It took 100 percent of my focus to make it home safe. Again exhausted. I make a doctors appointment for later that day and lay down for a nap. I woke up worse than I have been so far and got a ride to the doctor. Doctor had me lay back and tilt my head slightly and watched my eyes. Checked my ears. Told me my right ear has some fluid built up and my eyes were shifting while turned to the right. He gives me a prescription for meclizine, tells me to look up the epley maneuver and basically says wait it out. I went home and once again so exhausted that I just fell asleep.

Today Friday 5/23 I woke up the worst it's been so far. I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open because of the shifting vision and spins. I forced myself to walk around my bedroom a little bit and tried the epley maneuver a few times as well as the half summersault I found while looking at the epley online. I've been dryheaving all day from the walking and trying the maneuvers. The only relief I get is laying in bed and being very still. I tried taking the meclizine and it made me extremely tired and I slept for a few hours after taking it. Since then I've been to the bathroom with horrible diahrea and more dryheaving. I have a headache and on and off ear pain in both sides. Spins are down a little bit but not gone.
I've made an appointment with an ENT but the soonest appointment I could find was Thursday may 29. A whole 6 days away. 
I have no clue what to do and I'm honestly scared. I don't know how much more of this spinning and nausea I can take. Is this normal for bppv or could something else be going on? Again I'm really sorry, I'm new to this and I've typed this out while spinning and I don't want to leave anything out. If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it right now.

I’ve been living in the same city my whole life. I have friends here, I know all the shortcuts, the good coffee spots, the quiet parks. It’s familiar. It’s safe. But lately it’s started to feel... small. Like I’ve outgrown it somehow. Same routines, same conversations, same places.

Now I have a chance to move to a new city. It’s across the country and completely different from what I’m used to. It scares me in a good way. There’s opportunity, new people, new energy. It feels like the kind of reset I’ve been craving. But I’m also terrified of being alone out there and making the wrong choice.

So here’s where I’m at:

A) Stay where I am and keep building a life that’s stable but maybe a little too comfortable
B) Take the leap and move somewhere new for a shot at something different even if it’s uncertain

I need advice on how to deal with the pain of finding out my ex has someone new—especially since it feels like he may have emotionally checked out or moved on even before our breakup. I also want to know how to stop comparing timelines and how to accept that someone let go while I was still holding on.

Context:
My ex broke up with me last year February. It wasn’t easy, but I tried to move on quietly. No rebound, no landi—just healing. Akala ko okay na ako.

Pero kagabi, my friends told me he has someone new. And guess what? Yung pinaghihinalaan ko dati na cowork niya—ngayon sila na. Parang gumuho ulit mundo ko.

The pictures? Sobrang close na nila. It doesn’t even look like “bago”—mukhang matagal na silang lumalabas. I don’t even know if I should be thankful na isang taon bago niya hinard launch, or feel worse thinking baka kaya lang talaga siya nakipag-break ay para tuluyan na niyang maipursue yung nilalandi niya noon pa.

What hurts more is that he once said “focus muna sa work, ayaw ko pa ng relationship.” Pero I guess iba talaga yung winork niya.

I even saw a Viber convo before with that girl—inaaya siyang mag-coffee. Ang dami niyang excuses, like “may anak kasi siya” and “friendly lang.” But girl instincts are real. I tried to ignore it back then. I trusted him—he was my first boyfriend. Never ko siyang pinag-isipan ng masama.

But now, everything makes sense. Especially after the breakup—he never even checked on me. Not once. Samantalang ako, umaasa pa. Napapachat pa. Kasi feeling ko hindi pa dapat kami tapos. Di naman kalakihan yung naging issue namin, mostly time conflicts. Pero feeling ko tinake niya yung opportunity na ‘yon to walk away and finally be with her.

Previous Attempts:
I blocked him months ago to help myself move on. I stayed away from rebounds, focused on healing, and really tried to be okay on my own. Akala ko nagwowork. But now, it just feels like I’m back at zero. Lahat ng pain, bumalik.

How do you deal with this kind of betrayal?
How do you stop comparing timelines?
How do you accept that someone let go of you while you were still holding on?

Any advice would really mean a lot. Thanks to anyone willing to listen. Btw I’m F(25) then ex ko is M(27). ",8,1748043008.0,adviceph,22,1.0,False

*Location: Havenbrook Police Station, Mercedes is still in the holding room, her frustration mounting as Tatum paces back and forth.*

**Mercedes:** *""I want a lawyer.""*

*Tatum stops pacing, her expression calculated. She leans on the table, staring directly at Mercedes.*

**Tatum:** *""You could get a lawyer, sure. But that’s going to make this worse for you. You want to drag this out, end up in court, and possibly face years in jail? Or we could settle this right now.""*

*Mercedes hesitates, unsure.*

**Tatum:** *""Tell me about Carmella. Tell me everything, and I’ll make sure things go a lot smoother for you.""*

*After a tense pause, Mercedes lets out a defeated sigh, her face softening.*

**Mercedes:** *""Fine. Carmella said the car was legit. She made me believe it was all above board, but... I guess I should’ve questioned it more.""*

*Tatum nods, her expression easing slightly.*

**Tatum:** *""That's better. Now, give me any contact details or addresses you have for Carmella. Help me, and I’ll help you.""*

# Lady Hunter, Yuri, and Jennifer Arrive in Havenbrook City

*Location: Havenbrook City, Lady Hunter, Yuri, and Jennifer pull up in a black SUV, parking near a bustling street.*

**Lady Hunter:** *""Alright, we’re here. Lyra said we should start by checking Carmella’s known spots.""*

*Yuri looks at Jennifer, who nods in agreement.*

**Yuri:** *""I’ll cover the north side. Jennifer, you take the south, and Hunter, you can take the center of town. Let’s see if we can track her down.""*

*They split up, each determined to find leads on Carmella.*

# Michelle and Lacey Working Together

*Location: Michelle's workspace, Lacey helps Michelle sift through documents and notes.*

**Michelle:** *""Thanks for helping me with all of this, Lacey. There’s just so much to go through, especially with everything happening with Carmella and the car.""*

*Lacey smiles warmly.*

**Lacey:** *""No problem at all. I’m happy to help. Plus, it’s kind of exciting, don’t you think? Like we’re unraveling a mystery.""*

**Michelle:** *""Yeah, I just hope we’re ready for whatever we find.""*

# Judy Álvarez's Feelings for Alinity

**Alinity:** *""Hey, everything okay?""*

**C.G. Maria:** *""Mordred was lost at sea years ago during a wrestling event on a cruise ship. It was during a match between Ashley Vox and Amber Nova. Ashley knocked Mordred into the deep seas, and she hasn't been seen since.""*

*Rhea and Gal exchange looks, intrigued.*

**Rhea:** *""What about Saw?""*

**C.G. Maria:** *""Saw is a whole different story. She was obsessed with dangerous riddles, like something out of the Jigsaw movies. She got her start by doing some Texas Chainsaw-type stuff. Not much is known about her childhood, but it wasn’t pretty.""*

*Gal shivers slightly.*

**Gal:** *""That sounds terrifying.""*

**C.G. Maria:** *""And then there’s Demon Martinez. She was crafted by a man named King Warrior, created through a super force to have a connection to the underworld. Vempress is King Warrior’s right-hand person, but Demon has her own agenda. She’s stunning, but deadly.""*

*Rhea tilts her head, curious.*

**Rhea:** *""And the others? Like Lady Joker?""*

**C.G. Maria:** *""Lady Joker is from Gotham City. She showed up after the Joker left. And apparently, Harley Quinn is dating Lara Croft now.""*

*Gal and Rhea exchange glances, both eager to hear more.*

**Cinna:** *""Me too. I could eat like, three of them.""*

# Carmella's Meeting with Marina and Ronda

**Marina:** *""Protection from who?""*

1ktxlpv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ktxlpv,Help Us Design Our Living Room - Layout Advice Needed,"My brother and I have lived together for about 3 years, and we’re looking to upgrade our living room. We could really use some advice on furniture and layout — we’re a bit clueless when it comes to design.

I’ve attached photos of the current setup, the furniture we’re considering, and a rough layout plan.

Here’s what we’re thinking so far:

	•	Remove the large mirror

	•	Get a longer, narrower TV stand that can also store board games (and eventually upgrade to a bigger TV)

	•	Remove the standing lights by the couches and the Funko Pops from the wall — we’re thinking of putting a mirror there instead

	•	Add a coffee table and some greenery

We’re aiming for something that feels more mature, comfortable, and put-together — nothing too fancy, just a noticeable upgrade. We mostly use the space to hang out, watch shows, and occasionally host friends.

We’re working with a modest budget but are open to investing in a few key pieces if they’ll really make a difference.

Any advice on layout, furniture options, or even plant suggestions would be super appreciated!",2,1748042651.0,malelivingspace,1,0.75,False

Details in body,"Disclaimer: I am of the opinion that in most of the SHTF scenarios we dream up, bugging out is a terrible option and the idea that you only have minutes to grab a bag before leaving your home forever is largely a fantasy. I do still think it is a valuable exercise in thinking about the situations you may find yourself in and what resources would be most beneficial. The best way to learn about what you may need is to go out, touch grass and figure out what works. with that being said I would still like to hear what criticism you may have, and maybe we can all learn something together.  
Packing list as follows:

# Mystery Ranch Blitz 35 litre backpack

# Water:

2x 32oz single walled stainless steel water bottle

12oz stainless cup/mug

140oz HydraPak water bladder w/ Katadyn water filter

Potable Aqua purification tablets w/ neutralizing tablets

MRE orange beverage base & emergenC 

4x instant coffee packets not pictured

# Hygiene:

Body glide for chaffing 

Blister tape (two brands, what I had on hand)

3x toilet paper from MRE

Camp soap (potent dish soap)

# Food:

5x Mountain House Meals

2x Backpackers Pantry Granola

3710 cal freeze dried

One MRE additional 1270 calories

Total Calories = 4980

There is an opportunity to add/replace meals with more calorie dense foods If the need to ""bug out"" ever arises. calorie dense foods tend to be high in fat, and therefore don't last as long on the shelf. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbmQRmuv88c) is an excellent video on the topic of calorie/weight in backpacking food

MSR Whisperlite Universal

30 oz fuel canister (full with white gas)

This stove was chosen as it can burn white gas, as well as regular gasoline. This is the benefit you receive for taking the weight penalty over a typical lightweight canister stove like the MSR pocket rocket. With the 30oz of fuel you can boil 30-35 liters of water. Even If I found myself unable to source more fuel for the stove, the stainless steel water containers allow me to boil water over a camp fire. 

# Clothing:

3x Darn tough hiking socks

2x Wooly merino wool boxer briefs

1x Smart Wool long underwear

1x Smart wool long sleeve shirt

1x Smart wool quarter zip

dry bag to contain, and wash clothing using camp soap should the need arise.

# Sleep System:

Snugpak Stratosphere 

Nemo closed cell foam sleeping pad

Helikon Tek Rain Poncho

Helikon Tek swagman roll

Mosquito net large enough for my head

length of paracord

This is the Summer rotation of my sleep system. It gets a little heavier and a whole lot bulkier in the colder months. Located in the midwest. A inflatable sleeping pad becomes damn near necessary once it gets colder. 

# Misc:

Titanium spork

Fjalniven S1x knife

Suunto compass (maps not pictured for privacy)

BLF LT1 4x 18650 usb-c rechargable lantern with powerbank capabilities. This things lasts for weeks on the lowest brightness. should mention a regular 18650 flashlight in on my EDC

Big black ferro rod

redundant lighters

duct tape

*Lady Hunter’s voice on the line is calm and focused.*

Mr. Henshaw’s distinguished career spans military service, government leadership, and private enterprise. A 25-year Veteran of the US Army, his service included extensive work recovering the remains of missing service members from numerous conflicts, including WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf Wars. This experience led to his expertise in international mass fatality management, evident in his leadership roles following the 2004 South Asia Tsunami, 2010 Haiti Earthquake, and 2019 Hurricane Dorian. Following the Flag Raising Ceremony, there will be a motorcycle ride to Washington, D.C. to join with AmVets in the Rolling to Remember motorcycle demonstration ride in our nation’s capital to raise awareness of the critical issues facing our nation’s veterans. All are welcome.

*Michelle reads the messages, the connection between Baddy and Issac evident.*

**Baddy:** *""Issac helped me and Jazzy back when we had nothing. We moved to California from Puerto Rico, and it was tough. He was like a guardian angel—kept us afloat, introduced me and Jazzy to each other, helped us build something out of nothing.""*

*She pauses, her eyes getting glassy as she looks away.*

**Baddy:** *""That car… it was built by Issac. He gave it to me because he knew I had nothing at the time, no hope. And now, I’ve had it for twenty years. It’s more than just a car—it’s a reminder of who I was and how far I’ve come because of him.""*

**Michelle:** *""We’ll get it back for you, Baddy. You just need to trust me and stay patient.""*

**Baddy:** *""I do trust you, Michelle. Just… make sure Mercedes knows the truth.""*

# Tatum Interviews Mercedes

*Location: The police station, Mercedes sits in the interrogation room, her arms crossed as Tatum walks in. Tatum pulls out her notepad, sitting across from Mercedes.*

**Tatum:** *""Mercedes, I need to know your side of the story. You mentioned buying the car from Carmella. Did she give you any paperwork?""*

**Mercedes:** *""Yeah, she said everything was in order. I questioned the price—$2.5 million is a lot for a car, but she convinced me it was worth it.""*

*Tatum frowns, tapping her pen against her notepad.*

**Tatum:** *""Mercedes, the bill of sale was faked. Carmella scammed you.""*

**Mercedes (angry):** *""You’re lying. Carmella wouldn’t do that.""*

**Tatum:** *""If I’m lying, then why can’t we get ahold of her? Every time we call, her number comes back unlisted.""*

*Mercedes remains silent, her expression faltering for the first time.*

**Tatum:** *""Listen, I understand that you might have genuinely believed you were buying the car legitimately, but the reality is, Carmella lied to you. The car belongs to Baddy, and we can prove it.""*

*Mercedes clenches her jaw, refusing to meet Tatum’s eyes.*

**Mercedes:** *""I’ll only apologize if Baddy shows me the proof of ownership.""*

**Tatum:** *""We can arrange that. But in the meantime, think about what’s really going on here. Carmella used you, Mercedes.""*

*Mercedes doesn’t respond, her silence now a mix of anger and realization.*

*Location: Judy’s apartment, morning sunlight filters through the curtains. Judy and Alinity sit on the couch, both nursing cups of coffee, their heads aching from the night before.*

**Judy:** *""Okay, let’s try to piece this together. We were at Shakira’s club… we had a lot of drinks… and then…""*

*Alinity looks down, her cheeks slightly flushed.*

**Alinity:** *""We kissed, didn’t we?""*

**Judy (smirking):** *""Yeah, we did. I mean, I’m not complaining—it was a pretty good kiss.""*

*They both laugh, the awkwardness of the moment fading.*

**Alinity:** *""It’s just… I don’t know. It was fun, but I don’t want to complicate things.""*

**Judy:** *""I get it. No pressure, Alinity. We were just having fun. Let’s just keep things chill.""*

*Alinity nods, smiling.*

**Alinity:** *""Thanks, Judy. I needed a night out, and I’m glad it was with you.""*

# Hendra and Andreja Head Home

*Location: Alexa’s front porch, Hendra helps Andreja to the car, her arm around Andreja’s shoulders as they walk.*

**Hendra:** *""So, how did it go with Alexa? You look… different.""*

**Andreja (sighing):** *""It went well, I think. I talked about a lot of things I hadn’t realized were weighing me down. Alexa’s a good listener.""*

*Hendra nods, opening the car door for Andreja.*

**Hendra:** *""I’m glad. You deserve some peace, Andreja. Just remember, you’re not alone. I’m here, no matter what.""*

*Andreja smiles softly, her eyes filled with gratitude.*

**Andreja:** *""I know, Hendra. Thank you for being patient with me.""*

# Emiru and Sonya Stay Up All Night Gaming

*Location: Emiru’s living room, Sonya and Emiru are still glued to the TV screen, controllers in hand, as the early morning light begins to seep in.*

**Sonya (yawning):** *""How are you still awake, Emiru? I’m dying here.""*

**Emiru (laughing):** *""I’m used to it. Cinna always taps out early, but I’m a night owl.""*

**Sonya:** *""Yeah, well, I’m not. I think I’m ready to call it quits.""*

*Emiru nods, pausing the game and setting her controller down.*

**Emiru:** *""Alright, let’s crash. We’ll pick it back up later.""*

*Sonya smiles, stretching her arms as she gets up.*

**Sonya:** *""You’re on.""*

# Gal Wins Paintball, Rhea Demands a Rematch

*Location: Paintball arena, Gal raises her paintball gun in victory, her face covered in paint but her grin triumphant.*

**Gal:** *""Victory is mine!""*

**Rhea (smirking):** *""Don’t get too comfortable, Gal. After lunch, I want a rematch.""*

**Gal:** *""You’re on, Rhea. I’m ready to win again.""*

*C.G. Maria laughs from the sidelines, shaking her head at their competitiveness.*

**C.G. Maria:** *""You two never change. Alright, let’s go grab some food before the next round.""*

# Lyra Looks Deeper Into Carmella's Background

*Location: Lyra’s office, she sits at her computer, a series of documents and images on her screen. She’s looking into Carmella’s background, her eyes widening at what she finds.*

**Lyra (to herself):** *""This is… shocking. I didn’t know Carmella was involved in so much. There’s got to be a reason she’s doing all of this.""*

*She scribbles down notes, her mind racing as she tries to connect the dots.*

**Lyra:** *""I need to share this with the others. This might explain why Carmella’s been lying and scamming people.""*

*She picks up her phone, dialing Michelle’s number, ready to share her findings.*",1,1748042480.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

I need to preface this long wall of text by saying we are both behaving very immaturely.

To give some background it’s medical school application season and my friend has trouble getting things done on time. As I understand it, med school apps should ideally be submitted the first week of june. He told me he wanted “motivation” and to be held accountable for starting his apps. He said he’d give me $20 if he didn’t get me a draft of his med school apps by May 9th. I said he didn’t have to do that but he insisted. Well, the date came and went and I told him he owed me $20. He didn’t pay it. I was petty and called him out in our groupchat saying, “guys x owes me $20, can ya’ll help hold him accountable?” They joked around about how if I beat him in a race we had been meaning to do then he’d have to pay double what he owed me.

The next time I saw him was the following week. I asked him again if he was going to pay up and he kept dodging me. I should have dropped it because he clearly didn’t seem to be in a good mood but I kept pushing and said he couldn’t leave until he gave me my $20. I showed him my venmo QR code and he kept pretending to not be able to scan it. I got upset then and said he also owe me money for the times I bought him coffee and he didn’t pay me back so I expected him to pay that as well. One of our mutual friends jumped in then and called him a “little bitch” for not paying up. I echoed the sentiment saying he better pay up. He stormed off. Throughout the whole scene I could tell he was getting progressively more upset and so was I. He said in the past he’d pay me back for the coffee but he didn’t and he never once bought me coffee to make it an even exchange. I also didn’t like that he was dodging something he has proposed (the $20). Later that day I got a venmo payment from him for $70, I sent back what he didn’t owe me. That’s when it hit me that he was super upset.


I apologized for calling him out in front of ppl we knew and decided to not say anything else until he responded. At midnight I got a long text from him saying how it is a repeated pattern of behavior that I’m mean and then apologize over text. He then cited some examples and how my behavior has negatively affected him I didn’t know this was an issue until that night. I thought because he had accepted my apologies he had actually forgiven me. And I have never held a grudge with him about dumb stuff (e.g. he bullied my sonny angel collection and said no one would want to be my friend if they saw my weird dolls). Amongst our friends we also had a bit going of mean banter. He would call me a sewer rat and I would do the same or I would say if he was cheese he’d be provolone and he’d say I would be moldy cheese, things like that. I genuinely thought this was a bit and all our friends did too but he expressed that this was me being mean. I was very confused because he never communicated that he wanted our dynamic to change. 

I crafted a very long response where I again apologized for my previous behavior and again for the money incident and explained that it wasn’t him owing me money that bothered me, it was him not sticking to his word. We haven’t spoken since and I avoided a group hang out so he would feel more comfortable attending (I told him I would do this in my apology text). 

So this is where we are now. I am giving him space, there is not much else I can do. It just makes me sad that this is where our friendship ends. If anyone has any advice on how to proceed that would be great. Thanks for reading :)

1ktxg1r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ktxg1r,1 bedroom in a 3 br/1 ba Kips Bay Apartment,"We are looking to fill our 3rd bedroom in a 3 br/ 1 ba apartment in Kips Bay. We are looking for a young professional preferably in their late 20s - early 30s who is respectful of the space and keeps the apartment clean. Someone who does their own thing but also would be down for an occasional movie night or roomie dinner/drinks. 

About the room: 
The bedroom is 9x7 ft with a descent sized closet. Bed and dresser can be left for a small fee or can be completely unfurnished.

About the apartment: 
The rest of the apartment is fully furnished. The living room is cozy and bright. We have a very comfy couch that makes for a perfect movie night. We have a small kitchen with stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher. The bathroom is clean and a good size for 3 people to work with. 

About the roomies:
We are two 28 year old girls both employed. Emily works in fashion and is in office 5 days a week and Bridget works in consulting remote from home. Emily is from Ohio and has been living in NY for 6 years. Bridget is from Virginia and has been living in NY for 4 years. We both enjoy having a night out and socializing, but just as much like to stay in for a movie night. We are friendly and like the apartment to be clean and feel welcoming to all who live there and might visit. 

MUST be okay with living with a cat!! 
Bridget has a cat named Stevie who is very cute and sweet but very shy so never causes any trouble as she is usually under Bridget’s bed or the couch. 

About the building:
The building is in a cute gated private courtyard. It features a great semi-furnished rooftop and laundry in the basement. The other residents are quiet and friendly. Super lives in another building in the gated area. 

About the area: 
We are in the heart of Kips Bay. Our street itself is very quiet while still being around the busyness of 3rd avenue which makes it feel safe to walk around all hours of the day. We are a quick 6 min walk from the 6 train, 12 min walk from the R/W and 15 min walk from 4/5/6, N/Q/R/W and L trains. We are also steps away for a ton of buses making it easy to travel wherever! Kips Bay is a great fun area with a bunch of grocery stores, delis, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. all over.

I am really fortunate to live in a place where noise...sound..or loud music is a non-issue.  So trust me when i say I take full advantage of this as much as I can.  I push this sucker..not Maxell level but it is up their.  I had an old friend over who I hadn't seen in awhile.  We were sitting...getting into some Aldo Nova..Dire Straights I think.

Are you dreaming of turquoise waters, endless sunshine, and someone handing you frosty beverages, all without your wallet weeping uncontrollably? Yeah, me too. We've all seen those glossy travel pics that scream ""luxury"" and ""empty bank account."" But what if I told you that a slice of paradise, complete with all-you-can-eat buffets and unlimited poolside cocktails, doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg? This ain't some far-fetched fantasy; it's a very achievable reality, and we're about to dive headfirst into the glorious world of the **cheapest all inclusive resort destinations**. Forget those eye-watering price tags. We're talking about places where your money stretches further than a yoga instructor in a pretzel pose, leaving you with more cash for souvenirs (or, let's be honest, more piña coladas). It's high time you treated yourself without the financial hangover, right?

### Chasing the Horizon Without Breaking the Bank: Unearthing Affordable Paradise

For so long, the phrase ""all-inclusive resort"" has conjured images of opulent suites and Michelin-star dining, firmly placing it in the realm of the rich and famous. Well, guess what? That's an outdated notion, a relic of a bygone era. The travel landscape has shifted dramatically, opening up a treasure trove of destinations where the all-inclusive experience is not just a luxury, but an accessible and affordable option for pretty much everyone. We're not talking about roughing it here; we're talking about comfortable accommodations, plenty of food and drink, and fun activities, all bundled into one easy-to-manage price. It's about getting the most bang for your travel buck, leaving you with more memories and less financial stress. Think of it as a magic trick, but for your vacation budget.

#### Why All-Inclusive is a Saver's Secret Weapon

Let's be real, budgeting for a vacation can feel like trying to herd cats. You book the flights, then the hotel, then you start agonizing over how much you'll spend on food, drinks, activities, and those inevitable impulse buys. It's a constant juggle, a mental spreadsheet that never seems to balance until you get home and stare forlornly at your bank statement. Enter the all-inclusive resort. It's the ultimate antidote to this travel anxiety. Your meals? Covered. Your drinks? Flowing freely. Entertainment? Often included. Suddenly, that mental spreadsheet becomes a lot simpler. You pay one price upfront, and a huge chunk of your on-vacation expenses are already taken care of. It’s like getting a superpower for your wallet.

Think about it: how many times have you been on vacation, desperately trying to figure out how much that next meal is going to cost, or debating whether you should splurge on that extra cocktail? With all-inclusive, those worries vanish. You can grab a second plate at the buffet without a second thought, order that fancy drink by the pool because, hey, it's already paid for, and try out that paddleboard lesson without worrying about hidden fees. It frees you up to truly relax and enjoy your surroundings, rather than constantly doing mental arithmetic. It’s a level of freedom that’s truly invaluable when you’re on vacation.

##### The Hidden Perks You Might Not Know About

Beyond the obvious benefits of included food and drink, many all-inclusive resorts offer a surprising array of extra perks that can further boost your vacation value. We're not just talking about a lukewarm coffee and a sad pastry. Many include access to non-motorized water sports like kayaking and snorkeling, on-site entertainment like live music and cultural shows, fitness centers, and even kids' clubs. Some go the extra mile with included excursions or spa credits, making the overall package even more appealing. It's like finding extra fries at the bottom of the bag, but way better because it's vacation.

And let's not forget the sheer convenience. You don't have to wander around a new destination trying to find a restaurant, or constantly be pulling out cash or cards. Everything you need is right there, within the resort's grounds. This can be particularly appealing for families or those who prefer a more relaxed and hassle-free travel experience. It's about reducing decision fatigue and maximizing your relaxation time. Who wants to spend their precious holiday time figuring out logistics when they could be lounging by the pool?

### The Caribbean Calling (on a Budget): Finding Affordable Isles

Ah, the Caribbean. Just the name conjures images of white-sand beaches, swaying palm trees, and water so blue it looks like it's been photoshopped. It's the epitome of a tropical escape, and for a long time, it was associated with hefty price tags. But fear not, sun-seekers! The Caribbean is home to some of the most fantastic and affordable all-inclusive resorts out there. You just have to know where to look. We're talking about islands that offer the quintessential Caribbean experience – the warmth, the beauty, the laid-back vibe – minus the exorbitant cost. It’s like finding the perfect vintage dress at a thrift store; a hidden gem that makes you feel fabulous without emptying your pockets.

#### Dominican Republic: More Bang for Your Buck and Beyond

When we talk about **cheapest all inclusive resort destinations**, the Dominican Republic is almost always at the top of the list, and for good reason. This vibrant island nation in the Caribbean offers an incredible combination of stunning beaches, rich culture, and, most importantly, incredibly affordable all-inclusive options. You can find resorts here that offer fantastic amenities, delicious food, and plenty of fun activities without costing a fortune. It's a place where you can get that postcard-perfect beach vacation without having to take out a second mortgage.

From the bustling shores of Punta Cana, with its seemingly endless stretch of resorts, to the more laid-back vibes of Puerto Plata and the cultural heart of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic offers a diverse range of experiences. The resorts here cater to all sorts of travelers, from families looking for kid-friendly fun to couples seeking a romantic getaway. And the prices, my friends, are often jaw-droppingly low, especially during the shoulder seasons or if you snag a good deal.

##### Why the DR is a Serious Contender for Your Budget Getaway

Beyond the attractive price point, the Dominican Republic boasts some seriously beautiful scenery. Think miles of pristine coastline, lush interior landscapes, and vibrant coral reefs teeming with marine life. The culture is also a big draw, with a colorful history, infectious music (hello, merengue and bachata!), and friendly locals. You can spend your days lounging on the beach, exploring historical sites, zip-lining through the jungle, or learning to dance the night away.

The resorts in the DR have perfected the all-inclusive model, offering everything from buffet and à la carte dining options to multiple swimming pools, bars, and entertainment venues. Many include daily activities like beach volleyball, water aerobics, and evening shows. It's a complete vacation package all wrapped up in a beautiful tropical setting. And let's not forget the food – a delicious blend of Creole, Spanish, and African influences. You'll be feasting on everything from fresh seafood to hearty stews.

###### Pro Tips for Scoring the Best Deals in the DR

Want to really maximize your savings in the Dominican Republic? Here are a few pointers:

1. **Travel during the shoulder season:** The sweet spot is typically from late April to June and September to November. The weather is still fantastic, but you'll avoid the peak season crowds and prices.
2. **Be flexible with your dates:** If you can travel mid-week or avoid major holidays, you'll likely find better deals.
3. **Look for package deals:** Bundling your flight and hotel can often result in significant savings.
4. **Read reviews:** Not all budget resorts are created equal. Check recent reviews to get a sense of the quality and service.
5. **Consider resorts slightly outside the main tourist hubs:** You might find even better value in areas like La Romana or Samaná.

It's all about being a savvy traveler and doing a little homework. But trust me, the rewards – a fantastic vacation at an unbelievable price – are totally worth it. It’s like being a detective, but your reward is sunshine and a swim-up bar.

#### Mexico's Marvels on a Budget: Beyond Cancun's Club Scene

Mexico! The land of tacos, tequila, and vibrant fiestas! It's another perennial favorite for all-inclusive vacations, and while some of the more well-known areas can be pricey, Mexico offers a wealth of incredibly affordable options, particularly in areas outside of the most popular tourist traps. We're talking about stunning beaches, fascinating historical sites, and a culture that's as warm as the Mexican sun, all available at a price that won't make you sweat more than a jalapeño.

While Cancun and the Riviera Maya certainly have their charm, venturing slightly off the beaten path can unlock some serious savings. Think about destinations like Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific coast, or the lesser-known resorts scattered along the Yucatan Peninsula. These areas offer a slightly more authentic Mexican experience while still providing access to incredible beaches and affordable all-inclusive resorts. It's like finding a hidden cenote; a beautiful and unexpected gem.

##### The Allure of Mexico's Affordable Coastlines

Mexico's appeal extends far beyond its stunning beaches. The country boasts a rich and complex history, with ancient ruins (hello, Chichen Itza!), colonial cities, and vibrant indigenous cultures. The food scene is, of course, legendary, offering everything from street tacos to sophisticated culinary experiences. And the Mexican people are known for their warmth and hospitality, making you feel right at home.

When it comes to affordable all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, you'll find a huge variety of options. Many offer multiple pools, extensive buffet and à la carte dining options, and a wide range of activities, from swim-up bars to cooking classes. You can spend your days lounging on the beach, exploring local towns, trying out water sports, or simply enjoying the relaxed atmosphere of your resort. It's a cultural immersion and a beach vacation rolled into one, at a price point that's hard to beat.

###### Finding Those Budget-Friendly Mexican Gems

Here are a few tips for scoring a cheap all-inclusive vacation in Mexico:

1. **Consider traveling during the rainy season (June to October):** While you might encounter occasional showers, the prices are often significantly lower, and the rain usually doesn't last all day.
2. **Look at resorts in destinations like Nuevo Vallarta or Huatulco:** These areas offer a lot of value compared to Cancun and Tulum.
3. **Book during sales or promotions:** Keep an eye out for deals from airlines and travel agencies.
4. **Travel with a group:** Sometimes, group bookings can unlock special discounts.
5. **Be open to slightly older resorts:** While maybe not brand new, older resorts often offer great value and can still provide a fantastic experience.

It's all about being strategic with your planning. With a little effort, you can find an amazing all-inclusive vacation in Mexico that fits your budget.

### Beyond the Usual Suspects: Discovering Lesser-Known Affordable Havens

While the Caribbean and Mexico are undeniably popular, they aren't the only places where you can find incredible all-inclusive deals. There are several lesser-known destinations that offer fantastic value and unique experiences. Going off the beaten path can be incredibly rewarding, allowing you to discover places that are less crowded and often significantly cheaper. It’s like finding a secret garden in a busy city; a tranquil and beautiful escape.

Thinking outside the box can lead you to destinations you might not have considered before, opening up a whole new world of affordable travel possibilities. These places might not have the same level of name recognition as Cancun or Punta Cana, but they offer just as much, if not more, in terms of beauty, culture, and value. It's about being adventurous and willing to explore, and in return, your wallet will thank you.

#### Bulgaria's Black Sea Coast: Sun, Sand, and Surprisingly Low Prices

When you think of a beach vacation, Bulgaria might not be the first place that comes to mind. But nestled along the Black Sea coast lies a hidden gem that offers stunning beaches, ancient history, and incredibly affordable all-inclusive resorts. It's a destination that provides a completely different flavor than the Caribbean or Mexico, but with the same promise of sun, sand, and a worry-free holiday.

Bulgaria's Black Sea resorts, like Sunny Beach and Golden Sands, have been popular with European travelers for decades, but they are relatively unknown to many North Americans. This lack of widespread popularity among certain travelers contributes to their affordability. You can find resorts here that offer all-inclusive packages at prices that are significantly lower than comparable options in more well-known beach destinations.

##### Why Bulgaria is a Budget-Friendly Black Sea Escape

Beyond the low prices, Bulgaria's Black Sea coast offers a lot to see and do. The beaches are wide and sandy, the water is calm and warm, and the coastline is dotted with charming towns and ancient ruins. You can explore the historic city of Nessebar, a UNESCO World Heritage site, or venture inland to discover the country's rich cultural heritage. The food is a delicious mix of Balkan and Mediterranean influences, with flavorful dishes and excellent local wines.

The all-inclusive resorts in Bulgaria are well-equipped, offering multiple pools, restaurants, bars, and entertainment options. Many cater to families, with kids' clubs and activities. It's a fantastic option for travelers looking for a European beach vacation without the hefty price tag of destinations like Spain or Italy. It's a chance to experience a different culture and enjoy a relaxing beach holiday, all within a budget.

###### Tips for a Brilliant Bulgarian Budget Break

Planning a trip to Bulgaria's Black Sea coast? Here are some tips for keeping costs down:

1. **Travel during the shoulder season (May, June, September):** You'll enjoy pleasant weather and fewer crowds than in the peak summer months.
2. **Look for package deals from European tour operators:** These can often offer fantastic value.
3. **Explore local markets for souvenirs and snacks:** You'll find better prices than in the tourist shops.
4. **Consider self-catering apartments with all-inclusive options:** Some places offer a hybrid model that can be very cost-effective.
5. **Utilize public transportation:** It's affordable and efficient way to get around.

Bulgaria's Black Sea coast is a fantastic option for budget travelers looking for a unique and affordable all-inclusive experience. Don't overlook this hidden gem!

#### Turkey's Turquoise Coast: Value and Variety by the Mediterranean

Turkey, with its stunning coastline along the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, offers another often-overlooked destination for affordable all-inclusive resorts. Known as the Turquoise Coast for good reason, this region boasts breathtaking scenery, ancient historical sites, and a wealth of resorts that cater to every budget. It's a place where East meets West, offering a unique cultural experience alongside a relaxing beach vacation.

Areas like Antalya, Marmaris, and Bodrum are popular with European travelers but are still relatively unknown to many North Americans seeking all-inclusive deals. This means you can often find fantastic resorts here at prices that are significantly lower than comparable options in other Mediterranean destinations. It's a chance to experience the beauty of the Mediterranean without the Mediterranean price tag.

##### Unlocking the Value of Turkey's All-Inclusive Scene

Turkey's appeal is multifaceted. The coastline is simply stunning, with coves, bays, and long stretches of sandy beaches. The historical sites are fascinating, a testament to centuries of different civilizations that have called this region home. Think Roman amphitheaters, ancient Greek cities, and Ottoman architecture. The food is a delicious blend of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors, with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and vibrant spices.

The all-inclusive resorts in Turkey are legendary for their extensive offerings. Many are massive complexes with multiple pools, water parks, countless restaurants and bars, and a seemingly endless array of activities. They often include things like Turkish baths, spa services, and various sports facilities. It's an all-encompassing vacation experience where you truly have everything you need at your fingertips.

###### Making the Most of Your Money in Turkey

Want to score a cheap all-inclusive vacation in Turkey? Here are some tips:

1. **Travel during the shoulder seasons (April, May, October):** The weather is still lovely, but the crowds and prices are lower.
2. **Look at resorts in areas like Alanya or Kemer:** These areas can offer excellent value.
3. **Consider booking an early bird deal:** Many resorts offer discounts for booking well in advance.
4. **Be open to larger resorts:** While some prefer smaller, more intimate settings, larger resorts often have better prices due to economies of scale.
5. **Negotiate prices for excursions and souvenirs:** While bargaining isn't the norm at resorts, it can be common in local markets.

Turkey's Turquoise Coast is a fantastic option for budget travelers looking for a diverse and affordable all-inclusive experience with a touch of history and culture.

### Beyond the Resort Gates: Enhancing Your Budget All-Inclusive Experience

Just because you're staying at an all-inclusive resort doesn't mean you have to be confined to its grounds. In fact, venturing outside the resort can often enhance your vacation experience and provide a deeper connection with the destination. Many of the **cheapest all inclusive resort destinations** offer incredible opportunities for cultural exploration, adventure activities, and interactions with locals, all of which can be done on a budget. It's about getting the best of both worlds – the convenience and affordability of the all-inclusive package, plus the richness of experiencing the local culture.

#### Experiencing the Local Culture on a Shoestring

One of the biggest benefits of traveling to these affordable destinations is the opportunity to experience the local culture without spending a fortune. Instead of paying for expensive guided tours, consider exploring local markets, using public transportation, and trying street food. These experiences can be incredibly rewarding and give you a more authentic feel for the destination. It’s like peeking behind the curtain and seeing the true magic happen.

Strike up conversations with locals (language barriers can be overcome with smiles and pointing, trust me!), try out a few basic phrases in the local language, and be open to trying new things. Visit local churches or historical sites that might not be on the main tourist radar. Attend a local festival or event if there's one happening during your visit. These seemingly small things can add so much depth to your trip and are often incredibly budget-friendly.

##### Budget-Friendly Activities Outside the Resort Bubble

You don't need to book expensive excursions through your resort to have fun. Many destinations offer affordable ways to explore:

- **Local Busses and Public Transportation:** Often the cheapest way to get around and see different parts of the area.
- **Walking Tours:** Many cities offer free or donation-based walking tours that provide a great overview of the history and culture.
- **Exploring Markets:** A feast for the senses and a great place to find affordable souvenirs and snacks.
- **Hiking and Nature Trails:** Many destinations have beautiful natural areas that are free to explore.
- **Visiting Public Beaches:** Enjoy the sun and sand without the resort price tag.
- **Trying Street Food:** A delicious and incredibly affordable way to sample local cuisine.

It's about being resourceful and willing to explore beyond the resort's manicured grounds. The real adventures often lie just outside the gate.

### The Art of Booking: Nailing the Best Deals

Finding the **cheapest all inclusive resort destinations** is one thing, but actually booking your trip at the lowest possible price requires a little strategy. Think of it as playing a game, and the prize is a fantastic vacation that didn't gut your savings. There are certainly tricks of the trade that can help you snag those coveted deals and make that affordable paradise even more accessible. It's about being a smart consumer and knowing when and how to book.

#### Timing is Everything: When to Book Your Budget Escape

Just like catching a falling leaf, timing is crucial when it comes to booking affordable all-inclusive vacations. Prices fluctuate based on demand, seasonality, and even the day of the week you book. Being strategic with your timing can make a significant difference in the final cost of your trip. It’s like being a seasoned surfer, knowing exactly when to catch the perfect wave.

Generally speaking, you'll find the best deals during the shoulder seasons, which are and between the peak and off-peak times. As I mentioned for individual destinations, this usually means late spring and early autumn. The weather is often still pleasant, but the crowds are smaller and prices are lower. Avoiding major holidays and school breaks is also a golden rule for budget travel.

##### The Power of Flexibility and Persistence

Flexibility is your best friend when you're trying to find the cheapest all-inclusive deals. If you're not tied to specific dates or even a specific destination, you'll have a much easier time finding incredible bargains. Being open to different travel dates or even different affordable destinations can unlock significant savings.

Also, be persistent in your search. Don't settle for the first price you see. Compare prices across different booking websites, travel agencies, and even the resort's own website. Sign up for email alerts from airlines and travel companies to be notified of sales and promotions. It might take a little extra effort, but the potential savings are well worth it.

###### Using Tools to Your Advantage: Price Comparison Websites and Alerts

In today's digital age, you have a wealth of tools at your disposal to help you find the best all-inclusive deals. Price comparison websites like Kayak, Google Flights, and Expedia allow you to compare prices across multiple providers in one place. These sites also often have features like price alerts, which notify you when the price for a specific destination or timeframe drops.

Setting up price alerts is a super easy way to passively track prices and jump on a deal when it becomes available. It’s like having a personal travel agent who works for free, constantly searching for the best prices for you. Don't underestimate the power of these tools in your quest for an affordable all-inclusive vacation.

### Conclusion: Your Affordable Paradise Awaits

So there you have it, budget travelers! The dream of an all-inclusive vacation doesn't have to remain just that – a dream. The world is full of incredible destinations where you can enjoy the luxury and convenience of an all-inclusive resort without spending a fortune.
