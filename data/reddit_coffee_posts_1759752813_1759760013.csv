https://preview.redd.it/qwfxorv20itf1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=0051a5a8481626312c81e25dd175f7c9746b563f

  
Between Thomas Russo's founding of the *Semper Vic Partners* hedge fund in 1990 and the end of 2021, the fund delivered 11.9% annual compounded returns compared to 10.7% for the S&P 500. 

While a meager 1.2 percentage points of alpha per year over the index does not sound fantastic, the magic of compounding really kicks in over decades of outperformance. 

11.9% annually over 31 years, or a cumulative 3321% return, means $10,000 invested in Semper Vic in 1990 was worth about $330,000 in 2021. 

For comparison, a $10,000 investment into the S&P 500 over the same 31 years would have turned into $236,000 by 2021. 

Allowing compounding to work its wonders is also a big part of Thomas Russo’s story as an investor. While buying and holding is often discussed as the secret to good long-term results, as we will see, Russo is among the very few investors to hold on to several stocks over multiple decades.  

For example, Russo has held on to positions in Berkshire Hathaway ([BRK](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/BRK.A/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) and Nestlé ([NSRGY](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/NSRGY/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) since the 1980s, according to William Green’s [podcast](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/richer-wiser-happier/move-slow-win-big-w-thomas-russo/?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io). That takes discipline and patience that retail investors can learn from. 

Let’s look at Russo’s most important lessons for long-term outperformance:

# How Meeting Buffett Changed Russo’s Investment Philosophy

“**One of the things Buffett said to that class in 1982 was that you never want to forget that the only break you get as an investor is the non-taxation of unrealized gains.** So you should take advantage of that. Make sure that what you invest in, as Warren said, allows you to be right once.”

When Russo was a graduate student at Stanford in the early 1980s, Warren Buffett held a guest lecture on his investment principles to Russo’s class. 

At the time, Buffett had recently pivoted from focusing on deep value and cigar-butt stocks as Ben Graham had taught him, to long-term franchises. The companies Buffett started looking for had intangible assets that gave the company pricing power and loyal consumers. Buffett has often referred to this as “economic goodwill,” as in some goodwill that does not show up on the balance sheet.  

So when Buffett spoke at Stanford that day in 1982, he focused on the importance of buying the right companies for the long run.

As a side note, the irony is that Stanford (and academia more broadly) at the time were pushing the idea that investing was a mathematical game and that markets were efficient. Among the professors at Stanford was William Sharpe, the man behind the Sharpe ratio. Sharpe and his colleagues agreed that investment risk equaled volatility, while of course, these professors had no investing track record to show for themselves.  

The lecture was important in forming Russo’s investment style early in his career, but meeting Buffett also contributed massively to his fund’s outperformance in another way. 

In the interview with William Green, Russo says he bought Berkshire at around $900 per share in the early 1980s. Given Berkshire’s price today, that investment has compounded at something around 16% annually.  

That does not necessarily mean the position has earned exactly those returns, but Berkshire Hathaway has been among the biggest positions in the Semper Vic portfolio for decades. While Russo has sold down in Berkshire in recent years, it is still the largest position in the fund at around 12%. 

https://preview.redd.it/lv2zlvb70itf1.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f61a94db377408af2ed4917d4335739e39b286

# Willingness to Suffer - The Power a Good Brand

“**You start with products that, with strong enough brands, the consumer doesn’t believe there could be an adequate substitute for. That’s what we start with when assessing the potential merit of any investment.** And is that going to be an enduring reason, or is it something that can be wasted and fritted away, or is it one that could be competed away?” 

In addition to Berkshire and Nestlé, some of Russo’s longest tenured holdings include Heineken ([HKHHF](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/HKHHF/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) and Brown-Forman ([BF.A](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/BF.A/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)), both stocks that he bought in the late 1980s.  

Even though both of these names have performed poorly in recent years (which perhaps explains why Russo has sold most of the Brown-Forman holding), these were really strong brands at the time of Russo’s investment. For example, Brown-Forman stock was up more than 1,000% in the two decades between 1985 and 2005.  

Russo has also mentioned that he believes other brands like Apple ([AAPL](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/AAPL/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) and Hermes ([RMS.PA](http://rms.pa/)) have similar characteristics in that consumers do not believe there are “adequate substitutes” for them. 

The most important lesson is not that investors should go ahead and buy these exact names. Russo has ridden the tailwind of brands that are non-discretionary and part of the daily habits among consumers. 

Notice how these names are not retailers or discretionary (like [LULU](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/LULU/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io) or [PTON](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/PTON/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) that can easily fall out of fashion, but rather brands that over time have proven durable and inelastic in that there are no similar substitutes.  

**Much of this comes back to what Russo refers to as “capacity to suffer.”** This means that the best brands are the ones that are willing to suffer over certain periods in exchange for what is best for the long-term health of the brand. 

That could mean extra reinvestments in marketing when entering a new market or, more importantly, not diluting the brand even if the company could make more money in the next few quarters by doing so. In many of Russo’s letters to partners, he also refers to this as “capacity to reinvest.”

One of the examples Russo brings up is See’s Candies, which Berkshire Hathaway bought in the 1970s. As a premium chocolate maker, See’s only makes profits a few months out of the year during the big holiday season.  

But instead of attempting to boost profits by launching new products outside of Christmas and Easter, See’s willingly “suffers” during these months in exchange for having a desirable brand that people continue to pay up for when buying chocolate for the holidays. This has allowed See’s to have a premium brand that can steadily raise prices without losing customers decades after its founding. 

On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of companies that have diluted their brands to please short-term Wall Street expectations or squeeze out some extra quarterly profits. 

For many years, Starbucks had a position as a “premium” coffee experience. That allowed it to charge higher prices for its drinks. However, in recent years, Starbucks has focused too much on drive-through customers and speed of service, while the in-store experience has slowly worsened. Customers are now rightly pushing back on price increases because, as Russo understood early, a brand cannot expect customers to pay a premium if the experience is commoditized.  

Several aspiring luxury brands have suffered similar fates. By discounting products to squeeze out some extra profits or get rid of inventory, brands like Gucci and Michael Kors have gone from premium to fairly mainstream. Hermes, one of the few true luxury brands out there, is intentionally “suffering” by capping supply and never discounting any of its products. 

# Be Ruthless About Selling

Russo also held investments in Altria ([MO](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/MO/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) and Wells Fargo ([WFC](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/WFC/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)) over several decades. However, both of these stocks were ruthlessly sold after errors that Russo deemed unforgivable. 

In Altria’s case, the company spent billions on stakes in Juul and a cannabis company back around 2018. While Altria’s main business (cigarettes) was and still is in secular decline, Russo believed it still to be a good investment because of its pricing power and high barriers to entry, in addition to the stock trading cheaply while paying out most of its profits as dividends.

However, when management decided to spend billions of shareholders’ money on acquiring businesses outside of its circle of competence (likely to boost earnings in the short-term to trigger executive bonuses), Russo sold his holding without a sliver of hesitation. 

For Wells Fargo, the company ran into trouble around the financial crisis in 2008 and had also made an acquisition of another bank years earlier that Russo regarded as a mistake. As the misbehavior came to light, Russo decided to sell and rotate the position into JP Morgan ([JPM](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/JPM/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+3rd%2C+2025&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)), which was led by Jamie Dimon, a CEO that Russo viewed as more reliable. JP Morgan is still a \~2% position in the fund today. 

I think the most important lesson for investors here is to have zero tolerance for management that don’t act in the best interest of shareholders. Whether they are chasing growth by acquiring unrelated businesses or misbehaving (Wells Fargo was later ordered to pay billions in fines), this should be viewed as money that could be distributed to shareholders through dividends or buybacks if there are no better reinvestment opportunities. 

There is no time for loyalty to a company, regardless of how long you have owned it or how much money it has made for you along the way. If management is only acting in its own best interest and not the long-term health of the business, it is best to sell sooner rather than later.  

# Conclusion

The investment philosophy that has earned Russo an 11.9% CAGR over several decades is one that most retail investors should take note of because it does not require anything but conviction and discipline. 

First, the ability to buy and hold for the long term is one of the most important advantages retail investors have over professionals. Because we do not have to publish quarterly returns or answer to outside investors, we can let compounding work its wonders over time. That is exactly what Russo has done. 

Furthermore, Russo’s intense focus on investing in good, durable brands is also replicable by anyone. The most important analytical ability is to separate fads from the competitively advantaged brands that will survive across market cycles. That takes work in terms of looking into management, compensation (is it tied to the long-term health of the company or short-term profitability targets that can be manipulated?), and the brand’s history. 

It also comes back to this “capacity to suffer.” If the company is willing to be out of favor among Wall Street analysts in exchange for making investments that will make the company more durable, that is a good sign. 

While we did not touch on Russo’s valuation criteria, even the best brand names can be bought at reasonable prices at times when they ignore short-term earnings and margin estimates while re-investing for the long run. That has happened to companies like Netflix and Amazon in recent years and it will undoubtedly happen again.

It’s just me, headphones on, digging through the underground every week for instrumentals that hit different.
No bots, no fancy promo, no fake hype, just trying to keep that raw, soulful side of Hip Hop alive.

It’s weirdly become a ritual. Mondays, I make coffee, go crate-digging online, and update the list. Some weeks it’s full of jazzy stuff, some weeks it’s gritty and dark. It all depends on the mood.

This week felt like autumn in sound form:
Skillz Flav – S E D A T I V E S
Kreatev – Black M5
KLIM – In The Mood

All three tracks have that kind of vibe where you just stare out the window and nod your head. The perfect soundtrack for rainy days and late nights.
It’s also a great shuffle playlist, every track flows into the next without losing that mellow, head-nodding energy.

The playlist’s sitting just under 100 followers now. Might not be much in algorithm terms, but it means a lot to me knowing other people still care about beats with soul.

If you’re one of those people, the ones who still feel something when a snare hits right, check it out and maybe be follower number 100.

1nzjtu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nzjtu6/explore_the_best_soda_maker_drinkmate_omnifizz/,Explore the Best Soda Maker Drinkmate OmniFizz and Is It Worth It,"Testing the Drinkmate OmniFizz, model 410-02-14Zx4, has been an unexpected voyage into bubbly brilliance. Imagine the moments when you crave a perfectly sparkling drink but don’t want to rely on pre-made options from the store. I felt like I was opening up a whole new world of fizzy possibilities with this machine on my kitchen counter.

**An Eye-Catching Design That Just Fits**

The sleek matte black finish of this carbonation machine blends effortlessly into my kitchen’s aesthetic. It’s compact enough to tuck neatly into smaller spaces but still retains a robust presence. Weighing about 15 pounds, it feels sturdy yet manageable to move around. The manual operation might initially catch you off guard if you’re used to electric gadgets, but I quickly appreciated how simple it made the process—no need to hunt for power outlets or deal with cords getting in the way.

**Effortless Operation and Fizz at Your Fingertips**

Patented Fizz Infuser technology is one of those terms that might sound gimmicky, but trust me when I say it’s the real deal here. Using the quick-connect carbonation bottle that came in the box, all I had to do was fill the bottle with my beverage of choice, attach it securely to the machine, and press a button to infuse carbonation. My favorite discovery? Carbonating iced tea and lemonade for backyard events. That hiss of carbonation being released feels both satisfying and oddly addictive, I’ll admit!

[Time to see Drinkmate 410-02-14Zx4 cost on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0cnq9rgq3/)

**Unmatched Versatility**

What set this product apart for me was its capability to sparkle pretty much anything. Store-bought soda makers usually limit you to water, but not this one. I tested juices, cold brew coffee, and even a glass of red wine just for fun (it worked, by the way, though sparkling red wine is definitely an acquired taste). Flat soda from last weekend's barbecue was resurrected with newfound life. For someone who enjoys experimenting with drinks, the options felt genuinely limitless.

**Highlights**

- Capable of carbonating nearly any cold drink.  
- The patented Fizz Infuser ensures smooth pressure release, reducing mess or spills.  
- Comes with four 60L CO2 cylinders, which, depending on your sparkling habits, could last a good while.  
- BPA-free reusable carbonation bottle makes the process eco-friendlier.  

**Areas of Concern**

- It's a bit bulky for those with extremely limited counter space.  
- The manual operation can take an extra few seconds compared to electric alternatives—worth noting if speed is key for you.  
- Replacement CO2 cylinders might feel pricey if used very frequently.  

**Product Alternatives**

Compared to big names in the sparkling beverage market, like SodaStream, this product shines in areas they restrict: the ability to carbonate anything beyond plain water. Other options often shy away from juices or pre-mixed drinks due to concerns over clogging or warranty voids, but Drinkmate bypasses those hurdles. While SodaStream might win the portability game with sleeker, lighter models, this machine fights back with its larger CO2 capacity and incredible versatility. If flexibility matters to you, this is an easy choice over its competition.

**Value for Money**

It’s one of those investments that pays off the more you use it. If you’re an avid soda drinker or someone who hosts parties where unique drinks are often in demand, this device feels worth it. Sure, there’s an upfront cost, especially factoring in replacement CO2 cylinders over time, but it’s nothing compared to the waste and ongoing cost of purchasing bottled sparkling beverages. Budget-wise, it offers both fun and practicality.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nzjssz,https://i.redd.it/pg5qy0y6zhtf1.png,What the Hell is... Quantum Physics?,"**Quantum physics isn’t just a collection of equations; it’s the universe’s secret language, whispering truths about existence that are both mind-boggling and awe-inspiring.**

As you delve into this classical beginner’s guide to Quantum Theory, remember that these rules, while inherently related to the quantum realm, can feel nonintuitive. They form the bedrock of particle physics, and if you struggle with some of these concepts, you're not alone. Even the legendary physicist Richard Feynman famously said, “If you think you understand quantum theory, you don’t.” So, let’s take this journey together into the bizarre and wonderful world of quantum mechanics.

# The Quantum Basics

1. **Wave-Particle Duality** Picture light as a multitasking actor playing different roles depending on the situation. Sometimes it behaves like a tiny bullet of energy (a photon), and other times, it acts like a spread-out ripple, much like ocean waves. This isn’t a glitch in the matrix—it’s simply how nature functions at the smallest scales. So, when you flick on a light switch, you’re not just illuminating a room; you’re engaging with a fundamental aspect of reality.
2. **Uncertainty Principle** Here’s where it gets a bit tricky. You can’t know everything about a particle at once. It’s like trying to photograph a hummingbird in mid-flight. If you focus on its position, you lose track of its speed. Conversely, if you try to pinpoint its speed, its location becomes a blur. This is Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle: the more you pin down one detail, the fuzzier the other becomes. It’s nature’s way of keeping some secrets close to its chest.
3. **Quantum Entanglement** Now, imagine two particles that are essentially “soulmates,” connected across vast distances—like cosmic pen pals. When you change one particle, the other reacts instantaneously, even if they’re separated by billions of miles. Einstein famously despised this “spooky action at a distance,” but experiments confirm it’s real. It’s as if the universe has a secret communication system that defies our everyday understanding of distance and time.
4. **The Observer Effect** Here’s a fun twist: particles behave differently when they’re being watched. It’s not just shyness; it’s math! Until you measure a particle, it exists in all possible states at once, much like a spinning coin in the air. Your observation “freezes” it into one outcome. So, in some ways, you’re not just a bystander in this cosmic play; you’re an active participant shaping reality.

# Mind-Bending Implications

**Schrödinger’s Cat (Simplified)** Let’s take a moment for a thought experiment that’ll blow your mind. Imagine a cat in a box with a poison trigger tied to a radioactive atom. Until you peek inside, the atom is both decayed and intact—so the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. It’s a wild concept, but it highlights how reality “chooses” its state only when observed.

**Time, Relativity, and You** Enter Einstein, who gave us mind-bending revelations:

* Time slows down if you’re moving really fast—like when you’re zooming near the speed of light.
* And remember E=mc²? It tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable, explaining everything from nuclear power to why you can’t outrun light. It’s a reminder that our intuitive understandings of time and space are just the tip of the iceberg.

# Why the Universe Isn’t “Common Sense”

Let’s face it: the universe doesn’t always play by our rules.

* **Entropy**: This is the idea that the universe is slowly falling apart—like your coffee cooling down or stars burning out. It proves that everything has a beginning, initiated by the Big Bang.
* **Before the Big Bang?** Time didn’t exist. Asking “what came before” is like asking “what’s north of the North Pole.” Mind-bending, right?

# Science vs. Spirituality?

Now, here’s where it gets even deeper. Quantum physics doesn’t disprove God; rather, it deepens the mystery of existence. Paul Davies argues that the universe’s laws are too intricate to be mere accidents. Whether you lean toward spirituality or science, quantum theory forces us to ask:

* Is reality just a complex math equation?
* Does consciousness shape what we perceive?

Einstein’s version of God wasn’t a bearded figure in the clouds; it was the “mind” behind the elegance of nature.

# Why This Matters to You

Quantum physics isn’t just confined to labs and textbooks; it has real-world applications that affect our daily lives:

* It gave us lasers, smartphones, and MRI machines—technology we often take for granted.
* It explains why the sun shines through nuclear fusion and how our eyes perceive light.

Yet perhaps the biggest lesson it teaches us is humility. The universe is weirder, wilder, and more wondrous than we ever imagined.

# The Takeaway

You don’t need a PhD to appreciate the quirkiness of quantum mechanics. The next time you gaze up at Orion’s Belt or plug in your phone, remember that beneath all of it lies a realm where particles teleport, time bends, and “impossible” is just another equation waiting to be solved.

As Paul Davies says, the universe isn’t a puzzle to solve; it’s a story to explore. And you, my friend, are a vital part of that story.",1,1759759076.0,WRXingaround,1,1.0,False

1nzjpza,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nzjpza/why_is_the_crown_choice_wall_cleaner_gaining_so/,Why Is The Crown Choice Wall Cleaner Gaining So Much Hype,"Testing out the Crown Choice Natural Wall Cleaner has been an eye-opening experience for me. As someone who takes cleaning seriously, I’ve cycled through numerous cleaning products, hoping for one that is effective, safe, and versatile. This cleaner stumbled onto my radar thanks to its all-natural formula and promises of removing dirt, dust, and grease from a variety of surfaces. Let’s dive into my experience with this unique spray, its pros and downsides, and how it stacks up against similar products on the market.

**Design and Usability**  
From the moment I held the bottle, the solid build impressed me. The spray nozzle is firm, with a design that makes even distribution a breeze. The ergonomic grip ensures your hands don’t ache, even during a deep cleaning spree across your home. What I love most about the spray functionality is how consistent it is—no odd dripping or malfunctioning mid-use, which is something other products in my cleaning arsenal sometimes fail at. Its 24-ounce size is perfectly balanced between being large enough to last several weeks and small enough to handle comfortably. Plus, the lavender scent is a refreshing touch, leaving the house smelling clean instead of chemically harsh.

**Strengths**  
• The rich lavender aroma sets it apart from other chemical-heavy sprays on the market.  
• Safe to use around kids and pets, which makes it a favorite in spaces like my nephews’ playroom and around my dog’s area.  
• Works effectively on painted walls, cabinets, wood, ceilings, and even stainless steel—talk about multi-functional!

**Performance on Different Surfaces**  
One of the most impressive aspects of this product is its practicality as an all-surface cleaner. It works just as effortlessly on greasy kitchen cabinets as it does on dusty, smudged walls in the living room. Once, I spilled coffee onto my white-painted kitchen wall, and I pulled this cleaner out to test its stain-removing abilities—spoiler: it didn’t disappoint. A few sprays and gentle wiping later, there wasn’t a coffee trace in sight. The steel cleaner effect surprised me too. My fridge, which constantly attracts smudges and handprints, looked freshly polished after using this spray. Its streak-free finish saved me from those annoying patchy results I’ve come to expect from competing products.

**Good Points**  
• Tackles stubborn grease stains with ease without leaving any residue.  
• Doubles as a deodorizer, thanks to the lavender essential oil scent.  
• Made in the USA and tested rigorously, giving confidence in its overall quality.  

**Safety Features**  
As a pet owner and an aunt who has curious little kids visiting regularly, I can’t emphasize enough the relief of having a product that’s safe to use in proximity to both. Setting aside the effectiveness for a moment, knowing there are no harsh chemicals to endanger pets or children ups its value significantly. I’ve watched my niece touch the recently cleaned walls—it’s great not having to panic about chemical residues. It’s rare to find something so safe yet equally effective.

**Negatives**  
• The lavender scent, while pleasant, may not appeal to those sensitive to fragrances.  
• A bit pricier than some traditional chemical-based alternatives, which might deter budget buyers.  

**Product Comparisons**  
When compared to household names like Method or Mrs. Meyer's, The Crown Choice Natural Wall Cleaner is slightly pricier but performs remarkably well on tougher stains. While some competitors handle specific surfaces like wood or painted walls admirably, this cleaner thrives as an all-rounder, reducing the need for a cabinet full of single-purpose products. That being said, brands like Eco-Me may offer a more fragrance-free experience for sensitive users, though I found they don’t always tackle grease stains with the same ease. In its class, the cleaner excels in safety, versatility, and as a natural deodorizer—crucial for people looking to freshen up their homes without added artificial scents or harmful chemicals.

**Value for Money**  
Balancing cost and quality is always tricky, but I believe this product provides excellent value. Sure, it may cost a bit more than bargain-bin brands, but you’re investing in safety, versatility, and a more pleasant cleaning experience. The added bonus? Its multi-purpose use makes it ideal for consolidating multiple types of surface cleaners into just one bottle—essentially saving costs in the long run while avoiding unnecessary clutter in your supply cabinet. Natural ingredients, effective formula, long-lasting freshness—this certainly feels worth every penny spent.

I'm thrilled to finally share a project I've been working on: a set of **Magnetic Coasters**. It came out of a simple, daily frustration—being tired of my coffee table looking messy with wobbly stacks and coasters scattered everywhere. I designed these to fix that!

Here's what I focused on:

* **The Satisfying 'Click' of Zero Clutter:** This is the core feature. I embedded strong magnets in both the coasters and the holder so they **snap instantly and neatly back into place** when you stack them. It eliminates crooked piles and makes tidying up effortless.
* **Modular for Sharing:** I wanted them to be practical for entertaining. The magnets let you easily **combine two or more coasters** to create one big, stable base for a hot pan or any large serving dish.
* **Weighted & Solid:** They have a nice, heavy density, so they feel premium and **won't stick** to the bottom of a cold, sweaty glass when you lift it up.

**What do you all think?** Is the magnetic stacking a feature you'd actually use? I'm eager to hear your honest thoughts on the design and whether this would be a game-changer for your living space!

Turkish Coffee

Add 1 heaping teaspoon of very fine (Turkish-grind) dark roasted coffee and 60–90 ml of water per serving into a Cezve (Turkish coffee pot).

Heat on medium until foam starts to rise—do not let it boil.

The result is a concentrated cup of coffee with a layer of foam on top and grounds settling at the bottom.

Arabic Coffee

Boil 60–90 ml of water per serving in a Dallah (Arabic coffee pot) or a Cezve (common in regions with strong Ottoman influence).

Add 1 heaping teaspoon of very fine (Turkish-grind) coffee—light or dark roasted depending on the region—plus cardamom and optionally other spices.

Lower to a simmer for a few minutes. Serve either unfiltered (grounds settle at the bottom) or traditionally using a piece of palm tree as a filter.

I was walking a lot, and stargazing at night instead of sleeping because I hated just laying in bed staring at the ceiling.

A little back story. I made a nice family dinner. Filet of sole with a rich lemon butter sauce. Perfectly baked. A lovely baked zucchini dish topped with fresh cotija cheese and cilantro. A micro green wild salad. A ginger carrot soup for starter and a chocolate raspberry decadent cake I found at the farmers market. My boy’s went back to their places at 7 or so. My wife and daughter wanted to watch TV. 
Generally I am a neat cook, I do dishes as I’m going along. This way after the meal the only clean up is the plates we ate on and serving platters. Sunday was no different. I told my wife and daughter, help me get the dishes cleared and rinsed. I’ll load the dish washer and clean up the kitchen and table. They helped and then disappeared into the TV room. 

I loaded the dishwasher, tidied up. Walked through the apartment to find any weekend glasses that might be lurking and loaded them into the dishwasher as well. When I was checking my bedroom, I thought of my hairbrush and comb. My brush is clean, I clean the hair out of it regularly with an ace comb. The issue is I use hair product and the hair product collects lint that wraps around each and every tooth/spindle/comb of my hair brush. It will not come off. I’ve scrubbed it, tried to pull it off with tweezers and more. I cannot get the lint donuts in the middle of the brush free. I always thought a cycle through the dishwasher will fix this. The long bath in hot water will dissolve the hair products. 

So Sunday no witneses, I cleaned my brush and comb. Put the brush in the top rack of the dishwasher. Comb in with the silver ware. Monday I was up at 5:30. I emptied the dishwasher as my coffee was brewing. The brush and comb look brand new. Is it ok I did this? ",3,1759758004.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1nzj6jo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzj6jo,"New to espresso machines, please help in narrowing down the list [€700]","Hi all,

New to this community (although I've been snooping around). Over the last year I have convinced myself (and the wife) that I need a new coffee machine. I've had my own journey over good old fashioned drip machines at my parents place (over 25years ago), the first Senseo devices, a Philips full automatic and now a fully automatic Siemens EQ.500. Over the years I noticed I dont need the milk functions as I purely drink espresso or lungo, and so do the visitors. I use dark roasted espresso beans most of the times, and my current Siemens EQ.500 I use relatively fine grind setting.

For my next step up I am eyeing piston machines for their technical simplicity, and the fact that (as far as I know) anything that needs to be cleaned is external (other than a descaling). Given my budget and knowledge (no experience, willing to learn) of making a good espresso I'm looking for a machine which allows some fiddling. I dont want a need of an enormous learning curve however, and I dont want this to become yet another expansive rabbit hole of a hobby.

At this moment I've narrowed it down to the following machines (all well available in The Netherlands):

* De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo EC9255.T (€550,-)
* Krups Precision XP801T (€530,-)
* Sage (Breville) Barista Express Black Truffle (€550,-)
* Philips Barista Brew PSA3228/01 (€700,-)

I appreciate that with a community as large as this one there will be lots of people who want to steer away from integrated grinders, and I can understand the idea of separation of functionality. To me it's not a size thing (two smaller machines could also work), but I actually like the integration. And I completely believe there are grinders which are lot better than these, but I'm assuming/believing that the ones integrated cant be completely useless.

What I can use a lot is user experience. Have you (used) any or multiple of these machines, what are your thoughts. I'm not planning for scales and precise measurements, can I not just learn by doing?",1,1759757576.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

But I've been on a nofap journey lately, and I'm starting to notice some positive changes. Suddenly, I remember something someone said in r/test about the energy boost from nofap, and it got me thinking.) So, what's your experience with nofap? Has it helped you feel more focused and energized during your day? If so, how did you maintain momentum when urges hit out of nowhere? I know for me, it's been tough at times. There were moments when I just wanted to slip up and fap, but I reminded myself of my goals and the progress I'd made so far. And every time I succeeded in not giving in to my urges, I felt a sense of accomplishment that kept me going. It can be hard to maintain the energy boost from nofap, especially when you're feeling tired or stressed. But if you've been there before, I'd love to hear your tips for staying focused and motivated on your journey. What small victories have helped keep you going? Maybe it's something as simple as a cup of coffee that smells sweeter, or a clearer head on your morning walk. Whatever it is, let's celebrate those moments together!",1,1759757537.0,test,0,1.0,False

1nzj3my,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1nzj3my/boyfriend_left_me_for_games/,Boyfriend left me for games,"What the title says. I’m 32F and he’s 30M. We were together for three years and had been living together for one year. 

I didn’t realise his addiction at first, as we lived apart and I was pursuing my Masters, busy building my social life in a new city. So we only saw each other a few times a week during which he gave me his full attention. Every time I called after school/work he’d be gaming, but still this didn’t raise any serious flags. 

It’s only when we moved in together I realised the extent of the addiction. From the moment he wakes up till the moment he goes to bed he is glued to the computer chair. It is quite common for him to never leave the house from Friday to Sunday. 

When he comes back from work the first order of business is the game. We built a schedule around this habit. During weekdays he’d stop gaming for a meal/tv show before going back to it. He’d bring a twitch stream into bed and continue watching streamers while he fell asleep. During breaks from work, bathroom breaks etc. he was on his phone watching twitch streams of it. 

He was super hesitant about us moving in together. And he initially asked if we could spend at least a few nights a week pretending we are “ghosts” to each other. I declined this obviously. But I know he needs a lot of space and I did my best to give it to him by staying busy. I’d even leave for 10 days a month to live with my parents since I work remote. I didn’t mind this and I hoped it would have given him the peace to play and get it out of his system so he could focus on life outside of it but this sadly wasn’t enough. 

We did go out occasionally and travel etc, always at my request. And I always initiated/planned everything. He was always reluctant to do anything and needed a lot of convincing. Every date night, routine grocery trip, walk to get coffee etc. I felt the clock start the second we left the door, and that he was anxiously waiting to rush back home when we were done. I think I was most useful for him when we had to go to his friends/family’s events, so he could show me off and tell the world that he had a girlfriend and lived a normal life. 

He essentially told me during the breakup that his ideal life would be that I never asked him for any dates, never asked him to do things with me at all. He wanted like a roommate situation where we don’t interact much outside of meals and a daily catch up or two. He said that living with me was essentially a constant calculation between how much time he was thinking I may ask for versus how much time he had “for himself”. (He always says things like “what I want to do” and “time for me” even though the only thing he’s doing is gaming). 

He told me that he didn’t think I should wait around for him to decide to stop gaming because he wasn’t sure if that was in the cards for him. I guess I’m glad he was honest with me and didn’t keep me hanging around for more years. 

Anyway, it’s a sad tale because he was a good boyfriend and treated me very well. It’s just that I competed for time away from the game and ended up losing. ",9,1759757379.0,StopGaming,6,1.0,False
1nzj36g,https://i.redd.it/echxzq2ythtf1.jpeg,Positano Sunday Font Trio: A Typographic Escape to the Italian Coast,"The digital world is filled with clean, minimalist fonts that, while functional, often lack a distinct soul. As a result, designers are increasingly seeking typographic tools that evoke emotion and tell a story. This search for character has led to a renewed appreciation for fonts with warmth and personality. The [Positano Sunday font trio](https://weandthecolor.com/positano-sunday-font-trio-ivan-rosenberg/206091), designed by Ivan Rosenberg, is a perfect response to this need. It’s not just a collection of typefaces; it is a complete design system that bottles the breezy, sun-soaked atmosphere of the Italian Riviera. This article will unpack the elements of the **Positano Sunday** font trio and explore how it can bring a touch of timeless coastal charm to your creative work.

# What is the Essence of the Positano Sunday Font Trio?

At its heart, the **Positano Sunday** font trio is a curated package of three typefaces designed to work in perfect harmony. The collection draws its inspiration from vintage Italian posters, the charming signage of Mediterranean cafés, and the relaxed elegance of a coastal holiday. Consequently, every curve and line is crafted to feel both nostalgic and effortlessly stylish. Using **Positano Sunday** is about creating a mood—one that is joyful, relaxed, and full of character. It provides a cohesive toolkit for building a memorable and inviting visual identity.

# Deconstructing the Trio: A Symphony of Style

The true magic of the **Positano Sunday** font trio lies in the interplay between its three distinct members. Each font has a specific role, yet they combine seamlessly to create a balanced and dynamic composition. How can these individual voices create such a harmonious chorus?

# Retro Sans: The Bold, Nostalgic Foundation

Retro Sans is the sturdy anchor of the trio. This clean, bold sans-serif font exudes a cool 1960s vibe. Its strong, confident letterforms make it an excellent choice for powerful headlines, brand logos, and any text that needs to make a clear statement. Furthermore, its retro feel provides a solid, stylish base that grounds the entire design.

# Script: The Heartfelt, Personal Signature

Adding a touch of warmth and humanity is the Script font. This lively, handwritten typeface flows with a natural energy that beautifully contrasts the structure of Retro Sans. It is perfect for adding a personal touch to your designs, such as creating an inviting tagline, highlighting a key phrase, or crafting elegant social media quotes. The script feels authentic and approachable.

# Outline Sans: The Modern, Artistic Accent

Finally, Outline Sans provides a dash of creative flair. As an outlined version of the solid Retro Sans, this font is perfect for layering and creating sophisticated visual effects. You can use it to add a stylish, modern contrast to your headlines or overlay it for a dynamic, multi-dimensional look. This font encourages playful experimentation and artistic expression.

# Why Positano Sunday is a Strategic Asset for Your Designs

Choosing the **Positano Sunday** font trio is a smart move for any designer looking to create impactful work efficiently. One of its greatest strengths is that it solves the difficult and often time-consuming task of font pairing. This trio offers a professionally curated system, which ensures your typography always looks cohesive and polished. Moreover, in a market saturated with similar-looking brands, **Positano Sunday** gives your project a unique and memorable personality. It helps you craft a visual story that is warm, aspirational, and distinct.

# Practical Applications: Bringing the Italian Coast to Life

The versatility of the **Positano Sunday** font trio makes it a fantastic choice for a wide array of creative projects.

# Branding for Hospitality and Lifestyle

Imagine a boutique hotel, an artisanal coffee shop, or a coastal-inspired fashion brand. The **Positano Sunday** font trio is perfectly suited for this world. Use Retro Sans for the main logo, the Script for menus or welcome notes, and Outline Sans for promotional materials. The result is a brand identity that feels authentic, inviting, and effortlessly chic.

# Packaging and Poster Design

This font trio also shines in packaging for handcrafted goods, from organic foods to luxury cosmetics. Its vintage charm makes it ideal for creating eye-catching posters that evoke a sense of nostalgia and wanderlust. The cohesive look ensures that the product on the shelf feels both premium and personal.

# Engaging Digital Content

For content creators, **Positano Sunday** provides the tools to build a beautiful and consistent online presence. The fonts are highly legible and visually appealing, making them perfect for crafting stunning social media graphics, blog post headers, and video thumbnails.

# A Final Thought: Typography as an Experience

Personally, what I find most compelling about the **Positano Sunday** font trio is its ability to transport an audience. It’s a prime example of typography that does more than just spell out words; it creates an atmosphere. Ivan Rosenberg has successfully captured a feeling of leisure and simple, sun-drenched beauty. This collection is a reminder that the fonts we choose are not just decorative elements; they are powerful storytelling tools. The real question is, what story will you tell with them?

1nzj166,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceFictionWriters/comments/1nzj166/where_is_purpose_of_life/,where is purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

It’s always the same recipe. 

First I match with a cool person we exchange instagrams and or discord and start talking on there send cute pics flirt and after a while we decide to meet up.

Then we go on a date and, everytime it goes really well we drink a cup of coffee chat and yap about our lives laugh and have fun then we say goodbye.

The next thing I know I’m being ghosted and we stop talking usually I’m not blocked but they just gradually stop answering.But on one occasion I was blocked on discord.

I truly do not understand I’m really respectful and understanding. Especially with the one who blocked me on discord we were so similar (we played the same video games read the same books and have similar hobby and we even have the same major) and they were so nice irl and on discord it was the best date that I have ever been on and I got a huge whiplash from being blocked and ghosted.

Can someone help me  figure out what I’m doing wrong ?

The alarm rings violently.

Her hand snaps to turn it off.

A mouldy gravel roof meets her eyes.  
It is cold.  
It is dark out.

*get up*

Her bare feet meet the splintered wood.  
An old t-shirt hangs limply on her exhausted frame.  
A dull ache wakes behind her eyes.

*be quiet*

She flicks on the light to the bathroom.  
Picks up the toothbrush.  
Back and forth.

Her eyes are still gritty with sleep.  
Her reflection stares at her in the mirror.  
Dark circles under her eyes.  
Pale skin.  
Unbrushed hair.  
She looks away.

The cold water from the shower  
Drips down her naked body.

*no hot water today*

After 30 seconds she steps out  
And drags on a stiff polo shirt  
And the rest of her uniform.

*make food then leave in 30*  
*should i wake him up yet? no not yet*  
*give him a little bit more time*

A harsh yellow light sputters on  
And reveals a cramped, sterile kitchen  
With two dirty plates in the sink.

*Oh god is there meat in the fridge*  
*can I give him some money for lunch*  
*I should have enough*

The fridge offers a plastic package  
Of sliced ham and some bread.

*thank god thank god*  
*need to go shopping after work*

The instant coffee is a relief.  
It’s bitter and hot  
And she downs it while  
Leaning against the kitchen counter.

*need to wake him up in 5*  
*let me quickly package his lunch*

A soft brown bag rustles  
As she slides in a neat sandwich.  
Ham, lettuce, butter.

She picks up a marker  
And draws a careful loveheart  
On the bag.

The marker is almost out.

*need to buy one more*  
*yeah that should be fine*

She packs his tattered schoolbag.

*please last a few more weeks*

Deep breath.

*need to leave soon let’s wake him up*

She softly walks back  
To her bedroom.

She steps over blocks of knock-off LEGO  
Scattered on the floor  
And moves to a corner in the bedroom  
Where a small, still shape  
Breathes softly under a thin blanket.

She places her hand on his little shoulder.  
His skin is warm.

*wait is he sick or is that just his temperature*  
*oh god please don’t be sick*  
*if he is can I take him to work with me*  
*no I can’t do that he’s just a kid how can I be thinking that*  
*please don’t be sick please don’t be sick*

He rubs his eyes.  
He sees her soft outline in  
The dim light of the fading moon.

He beams and hops out of bed.

“Morning Mummy!”

**7:30 AM**

The sun casts long shadows across the manicured lawns.

Campus is empty.  
It is silent.

The cart grinds over the cobblestones.  
Her keys jangle with each step.  
The water in her mop bucket makes a rhythmic *slosh-slosh*.

She arrives at a pristine glass building  
And scans her card to enter.

*i hope he’s okay the before-school care is a lifesaver*  
*but I hope he’s okay.*

She enters the bathroom.  
She assesses the scene.

Fluorescent lights glare off mirrors streaked  
With water and fingerprints.  
Wet clumps of hair lie idly in the sink.  
Muddy footprints line the tiled floor.

She begins cleaning.

*This floor first then the West Wing lobby.*  
*Can finish this quickly and spend more time*  
*On the engineering building.*

Scrape.  
Scrub.  
Back and forth.

*i’ll get paid on Saturday*  
*i can pay last week’s rent with it*  
*it’s late*  
*that leaves me $42.50 for groceries*  
*what about his jacket he was shivering this morning*  
*he needs a new jacket*  
*oh God his school trip he has to go*  
*all his friends are going*  
*Iill make it work i’ll figure it out*

She moves to the first stall.  
Lifts the lid.  
A yellow ring marks the waterline.  
Wet scraps of toilet paper cling to the edge.  
Streaks of brown spatter the bowl.

She wipes the bowl down.  
Flushes.  
*i can fix his jacket actually I should’ve fixed it last night*  
*i just don’t even remember falling asleep*  
*and now he’s probably freezing*  
*and what if the other kids make fun of him*  
She sprays thick blue gel onto the rim.  
Wipes.  
*god I hope they don’t make fun of him*  
*what if he’s sick again I can’t afford any more time off work*  
*i can’t I can’t I can’t*  
Brushes the brown off the bowl.  
Flushes.

Stall 1 complete.  
Two more left.  
Then the other bathroom on this floor.  
Then the second floor of this building.  
Then–

One at a time.

**1:30PM**  
She pushes her cart down the carpeted hallway  
Of the undergrad dorms.

*final room then I’m done then I can sleep*

Students in pyjamas chatter outside open doors.  
One of them complains about the dining hall’s lunch  
And orders Thai from Uber Eats.

The distant hymn of guitar and singing  
From a dorm room pierces her ears.

She walks by a dorm  
Where friends try on sparkling gowns  
For tonight’s formal.

*if I can get home by 2:15*  
*i can sleep for 45 minutes*  
*before I pick him up.*

She smiles at the thought of picking him up.

Five grinning friends in singlets and sunglasses  
Return from the campus gym  
And silence their conversation  
As they part around her cart.

She pushes open the door to the common room.

Empty beer cans and red plastic cups line the floors.  
A pyramid of greasy pizza boxes is piled on a table.  
Glitter is scattered across the carpet like  
Sand on a beach  
And a forgotten grey hoodie is slung over a chair.

A group of friends watching a movie  
Sees her enter and their faces contort.

“Sorry”, one mutters as they file out.

The first red cup  
Makes a hollow rattle  
As she drops it into her bin bag.

*final room. just get this done.*

1nziuto,https://www.reddit.com/r/science_humor/comments/1nziuto/what_is_the_aim_of_human_life/,what is the aim of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

This may seem like a small feat, but for someone who struggled with pornography addiction for years, it's a monumental step towards finding balance and mental clarity. I've been testing my resolve this week, as there were certainly moments when I was tempted to give in. However, I found solace in the little victories that piled up throughout my journey. For example, this morning, I noticed that my coffee smelled sweeter than usual on my walk to work. That small sensation gave me hope and encouraged me to keep going. As someone who is passionate about technology and startups, it's important for me to maintain focus and mental clarity. Nofap has provided me with the tools and resources I need to achieve this goal. By avoiding pornography and masturbation, I am allowing my brain to heal and rewire itself in a positive way. Now that my streak has ended, I am curious about how others find the courage and determination to maintain their Nofap journey. What strategies have you found helpful? How do you handle moments of temptation or urge when they come out of nowhere? I look forward to hearing from others who may be on a similar path towards mental clarity and balance. Together, we can conquer the challenges that come with breaking free from addiction and find success in our lives.",0,1759756727.0,test,0,0.5,False

I don’t do skincare, I don’t take vitamins, I barely work out (but trying to get into a routine again after a year break!), and I am awful at routine unless I think about it all the time, and I need some advice. I want to get healthy. 

Some background: 3 years ago I weighed 240 lbs, due to pettiness and bullying I starved myself (I became anorexic) and pushed my body past its limits walking 20,000 steps every day, going to the gym for at least an hour, and (not proudly) drinking 1000 mg of caffeine each day (several cups of coffee and energy drinks then taking “extreme” pre workout that had 400mg of caffeine in one scoop). After about 2 years of this, my lowest weight I had achieved was 140lbs. Due to mental health issues I immediately stopped about a year ago and after working on those issues, I’m back to a stable spot. Because of this I want to go back to feeling healthy again. 

My goal is to get to 160 lbs in a HEALTHY way. And not ignoring all other parts of my health.

I’m in search of any tips regarding weight loss and overall health. Skincare, diets, tricks for caffeine, work life balance, vitamins, supplements, anything at all.",1,1759756698.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

-‐—--------------------------------------------------------
Memory transcript subject: Captain Vrit, Gonzai Defense Force [standard human time]: July 15th 2160
—---------------------------------------------------------


I get orders to do another patrol around the system as we all are because one thing is we've all been concerned on the fact that the f****** squids haven't been seen in 23 years and the fact that it's putting everyone on edge because as much as some of us are saying maybe they gave up honestly I feel like that's wishful thinking. 

I say that to myself in my office keeping an eye on every single thing that could possibly be the squids planning another attack.

One of the youngest crew members in the crew 36 asks me “sir I mean no offense but is it possible that they just stop fighting us?”

I say to him  “As much as I would love for that to be true we have seen what those bastards are willing to do anything to our people when we are not prepared not having our shells up I would rather be cautious and have everyone be on alert then think that they are gone”

When he's back on the bridge he sees one of his older officers relaxing and honestly I'm not going to be a clipped shell about it and say “You really feel safe enough to sleep on the bridge?”

The officer immediately wakes up and says ""Sir my apologies it's just that we haven't seen much of anything besides radio chatter of the Federation bastards and as much as I know I've lived way too long to believe the Federation would just leave it seems like it.” He says pulling up a drink of [ gonzai coffee]

I say “I've lived for 93 years personally even though it's not a long life.” 

“I really am starting to think that the Federation is gone but personally I don't want to leave my shell down if it's not true.”

The officer says “From what I remember hearing about back on are beautiful home 
Of Voda, Rebuilding efforts are going swimmingly.”“I honestly hope the next generation has a good childhood because this war has chewed through centuries of centuries of our people.”

I lift up my drink and say “Definitely as much as I feel like it's a little too soon to celebrate the Federation not being around because we don't know if they're just focused on something else we did hear reports before The Last Ship attacked is that they were fighting a different species I don't know what it was but that's what the report said.”

And my good friend Zupo is my second in command because the fact that he was able to quite literally destroy seven Federation vessels by himself 30 years ago and well we've been shell Brothers since we grew up together even though we're not blood it doesn't matter.

I say “What do you think?” 

Do you think that we should still be cautious or do you think we can afford to have some happiness again?
 I say as a joke but everyone knows this war has made a sense of cynicism that nearly has crippled our species more than the Federation can ever be credited on making

Zupo says “Vrit I know everyone is feeling like we've been having a Victory lap for a good while now but we still need to be cautious we do not need to get kicked in the shell right when something big is going to happen I'd rather be paranoid and cautious than allow one of those squids to kill one of our own again.”

I say “Come on we haven't seen a federation ship in over 23 years at this point besides the ones were salvaging for scrap or Tech because the fact is sure this time of Peace might not be forever the Federation might kick down our teeth the next day but at least we've had 23 years of peace or relative peace meaning children don't need to worry about going to school and getting bummed by Kolshian chemical attack or worry about getting shot in the streets or another God forsaken antimatter bomb at least 23 years of children have at least lived completely without the fear of the Federation sure will always be prepared but someday I hope this war will be completely over.”

Zupo says “I'm not saying it to ruin spirits I just do not believe the Federation after nearly half a millennia would just stop attempting to kill us all I'm just saying”

I say I know that that's why you're my best second I could get I say with a smile.

Then on my Captain screen I see a message from high command and says “Hello any attacks any thing we missed?”

The Chancellor says ""No you haven't missed anything I'm just trying to make sure everyone shell isn't getting too exhausted.” 

“When was the last time your crew was put on Shore leave?”

I count with my digits and I say “1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 it's been 14 Cycles sir”

The chancellor says “That's the case I'm giving you orders to head back and get some Shore leave you guys deserve it ever since I was elected 10 years ago I want to make sure everyone is feeling this peace I know it's premature to say that the Federation is gone but it has been nearly a quarter of a century so I think we can afford to have you guys go back to Voda.”

I say “Are you sure that's wise sir I know a lot of us have been wanting some Shore leave but are you sure that's a good idea?”

The chancellor says “Oh please we have more than enough ships to make sure that we can defend the system as possible especially thanks for the fact that our factories haven't been bombed in the past 23 years constantly we can finally rebuild what we used to have over nearly half a millennia ago but instead of all of the challenging issues of individual nation states We Are One People.”

I give a salute. “Thank you Chancellor”. [ gonzi salute is when the individual puts their arm primarily their dominant right arm upwards turned into a v and put their hand like appendage below their head]

After that communication is over I say to my crew says “Guess what that means everyone gets to get some Shore leave”

The crew cheers and everyone gets ready to do some Shore leave because everyone has their reason for joining the Defense Force some of them join it because of potential opportunity and pay and ration even though from what I've heard rationing maybe discontinued soon but well ever since the fact that the government want to make sure that the population have a good food supply they've made a bunch of laws and requirements that a lot of the farms on planet are controlled by the government personally I feel like that's pretty responsible because well if the government makes it there's no incentive to make profit the only incentive is to make sure everyone is fed.


( sorry for the bad writing I'm still not decent I only have a few under my belt but I hope you like the story idea.)

Although the bitterness level varied between brews, they all came out bitter — not the juicy, sweet cup I was expecting. Any idea what I might be doing wrong? Grind? Water? Steep?

I’ve also ordered a Hario V60-02 and Drip Assist(as I don’t have kettle only food temp measuring thermometer).
Will brewing with them be better for light roasts? Would love to hear how you guys brew light roasts using the V60.

⸻

TL;DR:

Tried brewing Bloom’s Salawara Red Honey (10-day rest) three ways with AeroPress (different grind, water temp, and ratios). All turned out bitter instead of fruity/sweet.

It should be another support system. And he works at a coffee shop where as he's making new friends, they Google his background? That was so dumb to throw in... like who starts hanging out with new people (especially when it comes to coworkers) and says ""let's research his history before we move forward"" ???  He doesn't have a job where ppl would do something like that so they totally lost me w those unrealistic chaos. Also, I respect that everyone's pitching in w Alice because Jim is a single dad, but someone should've stepped up and told her she was wrong after throwing that tantrum after just receiving a car for her bday, and that her dad was only trying to protect her when it boils down to it.

1nzikpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nzikpr/m24_and_f22_just_started_dating_after_three/,M24 and F22 just started dating after three months of talking. The night we exchanged I love you’s I found out she had slept with someone.,"To give context it started out as fwb. However every single time we hung out we would have very deep conversation about things that are very important to me. (Philosophy, art, dreams, passions, etc.) We were as they say “straight up vibin’”. Once a week or two in I said idc if you see other people but she kind of brushed it off like she wasn’t interested in sleeping around. I made it very clear that I wasn’t. 

As things progressed (and they did rapidly) I would fall for her more and more. We would talk about our dream lives and how we were going to make them reality. Push and encourage each other down this paths. Celebrate wins. Pick each other up after losses. I mean, even though we weren’t “dating” we were developing deep emotional and sexual bonds. About every two weeks or so we would have a sit down chat about how we felt about the situation, where we were at mentally and how we felt about each other. I was always very transparent about my feelings for her. About how I cared for her deeply but wanted to take things slow because she has two kids. 

Jump to today. I have met her parents. I made a painting that took me 20 hours just for her, no charge. Bought her a microphone to start her podcast. We spent every available hour with each other. This past weekend we went camping. I put more effort into it than I have anything else for a woman. Just really appreciated her going with me because I girl never had. We took some magic mushrooms and had a very very intense couple of days. Saturday night we exchanged I love you’s. I know, a little early for that. We both couldn’t hold it in anymore. 

She fell asleep and I started cleaning up the site. She got a semi urgent text from her mom. I responded for her. When I did I saw a name I didn’t recognize. I’ll spare you the details but the more I dug the worse it got. Long story short she went home with a guy and got coffee with him in the morning, THE NIGHT SHE MET MY BROTHER AND TWO BEST FRIENDS. That kind hurt. The guy on the phone was a guy she hooked up with before we were together but she like kept him around? There were plans to meet several times while we were together but always fell through. After a certain point she stopped responding. 

But the fact that after I went home early from our night out, after my friends left her, she went home with some guy. Casually told her friend “went home with a fine guy, we are getting coffee rn” and then texting me right after “sorry I’ve been sleeping” at noon. Over the phone she acted all tired and said she was at her friends. Deception. Shit really hurt.

I hate that went through her phone. I hate that I invaded her privacy. But after I started I couldn’t stop. So anyway. I ended it. She cried begged pleading for me to stay. She tried explaining but the more she did the more I felt like she was not taking responsibility. 

The thing is I do love her. I’ve never felt this way about someone and I’ve been in plenty of serious relationships. I’ve felt love before but this has been even deeper. I want to forgive her. I want to say to myself, she made a mistake. I want to work with her to rebuild my trust in a healthy way and all that. But I also need to protect my heart. 

So, if you’ve read this far, thank you. I have no where else to go to get this all off of my chest. I guess I’m just looking for thoughts and opinions on this whole thing.

She just texted me this:

“I don’t expect you to come back. I don’t expect you to forgive me. But I want you to know that I’ll keep fighting for you. With or without you. I’m going to become a version of myself that I have never seen before. I have a million thoughts going through my head right now, but all I can keep thinking is that you are worth it. Even if, in the end, I don’t get you. You’ve pushed me to want to grow. You’ve pushed me to want to be uncomfortable. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me. 

I hope you know that I am seriously, so apologetic. I have never felt worse about something in my entire life. All I’ve been doing is sleeping. I went to bed after you left yesterday, and I just woke up at 7. I’m staying home from work. I’m a fucking wreck. And maybe that’s selfish, but I can’t live with myself. I feel so fucking horrible david. I am so sorry.”

TL;DR : I found out she had slept with someone and kept it from me during the talking phase along with some other things. Found out directly after professing my love to her. ",0,1759756068.0,relationship_advice,12,0.5,False

1nzik7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/EWALearnLanguages/comments/1nzik7o/how_to_learn_a_new_language_faster_expert_tips/,How to Learn a new language faster: expert tips and tricks,"Learning a language can feel challenging and time-consuming. With unfamiliar sounds, grammar rules, and endless vocabulary lists, it’s easy to wonder: *what is the fastest way to learn a foreign language?*

The good news is, it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With the right strategies and tools, you can streamline your learning process and make significant progress in less time. Here’s a guide I’ve put together as a language teacher to help you learn faster, stay motivated, and actually enjoy the process.

# 🔑 The Foundations of Accelerated Language Learning

**Why Speed Matters When Learning a Language**  
Whether you're preparing for a trip, upskilling for work, or connecting with a new culture, learning quickly can make a real difference. Learning fast doesn’t mean cutting corners — it means using **smart, time-efficient strategies** that deliver results.

**The Role of a Positive Mindset**  
Mindset is everything. If you approach learning with curiosity and positivity, you’re far more likely to succeed. Mistakes are *not* failures — they’re stepping stones. Adopting a growth mindset transforms every misstep into an opportunity to improve. It also makes the journey much more enjoyable and sustainable.

# 🚀 Proven Strategies for Faster Language Mastery

**1. Focus on Practical and Frequent Words First**  
Start with high-frequency vocabulary — the stuff you’ll use all the time. For example:

* Learn how to introduce yourself, ask for directions, or order food.
* Tailor your vocab list to your goals: business terms, travel phrases, etc.

**2. Immerse Yourself Without Leaving Home**  
Immersion is one of the *easiest* ways to learn — and you don’t even have to travel. Try this:

* Switch your phone and social media to the target language.
* Watch shows or movies with subtitles.
* Listen to music or podcasts to absorb natural language and culture.

**3. Make Language Practice a Daily Habit**  
Consistency > intensity. Even 15–30 minutes a day can add up fast. Try micro-learning:

* Use flashcards on your commute.
* Practice speaking with language apps.
* Write a quick journal entry in your target language daily.

# 🛠️ Tools & Resources That Really Work

The best way to learn a language combines tech, structured learning, and real-world practice. Here are a few resources I often recommend:

* **Apps:** Tools like **EWA** gamify learning and help you track progress.
* **Corporate Language Training:** If you're a professional, these programs focus on relevant vocab — like writing emails or managing meetings — and help with both fluency and cultural fit.
* **Language Exchanges:** Practice with native speakers online or in-person. It boosts both your speaking skills *and* your cultural awareness.

# 🧠 Tackling Common Challenges

**Overcoming Plateaus**  
Feeling stuck is completely normal. Here’s how to push through:

* Change up your materials — try new podcasts or more advanced content.
* Set mini-goals: learn 15 new words a week, master one tricky grammar rule.

**Building Confidence in Speaking**  
Speaking can be the scariest part. You can build confidence by:

* Practicing with patient tutors or language partners.
* Recording yourself to identify and improve problem areas.
* Using familiar phrases in real (low-pressure) conversations.

**Balancing Language Learning with a Busy Schedule**  
No time? That’s where **micro-learning** comes in:

* Listen to a podcast while working out.
* Review flashcards during a coffee break.
* Do 5-minute drills in your favorite app.

# 🧭 Final Thoughts

So, how do you start learning a language quickly and effectively?

Start small. Focus on *practical* usage. Make it part of your daily routine. And most importantly — embrace the mistakes. The fastest way to learn a language isn’t about rushing — it’s about **using the right methods to make real, meaningful progress**.

Happy learning! 🌍✨

You can't go to Costa Rica and not indulge in the local coffee. It's some of the best in the world! But instead of just drinking it, why not see how it's made? A coffee tour is a fascinating, delicious, and aromatic cultural experience.

**TL;DR: The best regions for coffee tours are the Central Valley (near San José) and the highlands around Monteverde. Look for smaller, organic farms for a more authentic, hands-on experience over the huge commercial plantations.**

**What to Expect on a Coffee Tour:** A good tour will walk you through the entire ""bean to cup"" process. You'll see the coffee plants, learn how the ripe red cherries are picked, and understand the washing, drying, and roasting process. And of course, it always ends with a delicious coffee tasting session!

**Top Places for Coffee Tours:**

* **Doka Estate (Central Valley):** This is one of the largest and most famous coffee plantations. The tour is very well-organized and informative, and you get to see their massive, historic water-powered processing mill. It's a great option for a day trip from San José.
* **Hacienda Alsacia (Starbucks Farm):** Yes, Starbucks has its own coffee farm here that you can visit! It's a beautiful, modern facility with stunning views. It's very polished, but a fascinating look at the commercial side of coffee.
* **Don Juan Tours (Monteverde):** This is a fantastic, family-friendly tour that combines coffee with chocolate and sugar cane. It's very interactive and fun, making it a great choice if you're traveling with kids or want to see more than just coffee.
* **El Trapiche Tour (Monteverde):** A more rustic, traditional, and family-run operation. You'll get a very authentic look at how a small-scale farm works, complete with a ride in an ox-cart.

**⭐ Pro-Tip:** When tasting coffee in Costa Rica, pay attention to the brewing method. The traditional way is using a *chorreador*, which is a simple cloth filter held in a wooden stand. It makes an incredibly clean and smooth cup of coffee.

1nzigmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1nzigmh/we_actually_need_nationalism/,We actually need nationalism,"We’re seeing a rise in nationalism across the world. Politicians are stoking fears that our cultures are being diluted and replaced with something new. But there’s a reason it’s working, because they’re right. There is a threat to our culture that has been chipping away not only at our sense of identity but also at our industries and economies for the better part of a century.

That threat doesn’t need a visa or asylum. It arrives through business deals and on the screens of our phones and televisions. That threat is Americanisation. I love to travel and experience other cultures, but I’m often struck by how similar major cities have become: multinational chains everywhere, with buildings and skyscrapers that all look the same.

It’s not just in our cities, either. Think about the Americanisation of art. Most of what we watch and the music we listen to comes from America. Meanwhile, many of our own artists are barely getting by, working in coffee shops and restaurants, their talent unrecognised.

This is a serious issue. It hurts our economies, strips opportunities from our own people, and sends them to the US. American businesses and artists are immensely wealthy because the whole world uncritically buys from them, while we allow our own industries to wither.

Even their politics gets imported. I can’t be the only one who’s noticed a Trumpification of politics across the world, spreading at an alarming pace given that he took office only eight months ago. Something has to change.

That’s why I want to propose a new type of nationalism, a nationalism built on saying no to the American invasion. One where we invest our time and money in our own countries and people. One where we stop watching American TV, listening to American music, eating at American fast food chains, and buying American products and services.

A nationalism that correctly identifies America as the primary threat to our cultures, industries, economies and politics. One that gives us a shared sense of pride in what our nations uniquely have to offer. One that pulls us out of the modern malaise, no longer blaming migrants for a problem that is largely American in origin.

I’m not saying America is bad or that it has done this to our countries deliberately. We have welcomed the invasion of American culture and commerce. But we have done so to our own destruction. We’ve already lost too much, we need to resist and claim what's ours back.

We need a new nationalism that says “no” to America.

1nzifxh,https://i.redd.it/38zztg77phtf1.png,Elevate Your Style: Building the Perfect Wardrobe with Just 4 Essential Pieces – La Mode Men's Guide,"# Introduction

When it comes to men’s fashion, less really can mean more. A stylish and versatile wardrobe doesn’t require a closet overflowing with clothing—you simply need the right essentials. At **La Mode Men’s**, we believe in curating timeless pieces that provide maximum versatility, quality, and style. Instead of chasing trends, focus on the fundamentals of classic menswear.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the four wardrobe essentials every man should own: **the crisp white dress shirt, the timeless tailored suit, classic denim jeans, and the statement leather jacket**. With just these four items, you can build endless looks that carry you from the office to weekends, from formal events to casual nights out. Minimalism meets refinement when quality triumphs over quantity.

# 1. The Crisp White Dress Shirt

**Versatility at Its Core**  
The white dress shirt has long been considered the backbone of men’s fashion. Its universal appeal lies in its adaptability—it transitions seamlessly across different environments, from high-powered meetings to casual coffee dates. Whether paired with a suit, chinos, or denim, the crisp white shirt creates a polished foundation for any outfit.

**Styling Tips for Every Occasion**

* **Professional polish:** Wear your white dress shirt under a navy or charcoal suit for a classic, commanding office look.
* **Casual refinement:** Roll up the sleeves and pair it with dark denim for a relaxed but put-together weekend style.
* **Layering options:** Use it as a layering base under sweaters, blazers, or even a leather jacket for added dimension.

The white shirt is more than a piece of clothing—it’s a style canvas, adaptable to your personal aesthetic.

# 2. The Timeless Tailored Suit

**Boardroom Staple**  
Every man should own at least one high-quality tailored suit. It’s a symbol of professionalism, confidence, and sophistication. Whether you’re attending a job interview, an important presentation, or a wedding, a well-fitted suit sends a clear message: you’re prepared, polished, and refined.

**Versatility Redefined**  
A suit isn’t limited to boardrooms and formal events. By breaking it down into separates, you can get more mileage out of it:

* **Blazer only:** Pair the jacket with jeans or chinos for smart-casual settings.
* **Trousers only:** Wear the suit pants with a polo or knit sweater for understated elegance.
* **Full suit:** Keep it sharp and classic for formal occasions.

Investing in neutral shades like navy, charcoal, or gray ensures longevity and flexibility. With the right tailoring, a suit becomes an investment that pays dividends for years to come.

# 3. Classic Denim Jeans

**Casual Cool**  
Few wardrobe essentials rival the staying power of denim. From rugged workwear beginnings to global fashion icon, jeans remain a cornerstone of men’s style. Their appeal comes from striking the perfect balance: casual yet polished, effortless yet stylish.

**Dressing Up or Down**  
Denim adapts easily depending on how you style it:

* **Dressed up:** Pair dark-wash jeans with a blazer, crisp white shirt, and loafers for a sharp but approachable look.
* **Dressed down:** Wear with sneakers and a T-shirt for easy weekend style.
* **Smart casual:** Add a tailored jacket or knitwear to elevate the outfit without losing comfort.

Stick to slim or straight fits in darker washes for maximum versatility. Avoid overly distressed denim—classic is timeless.

# 4. The Leather Jacket – The Statement Piece

**Icon of Style**  
The leather jacket has been synonymous with rebellious cool for decades. From Marlon Brando to David Beckham, it’s a piece that instantly adds edge and personality to any wardrobe. A leather jacket doesn’t just complete an outfit—it transforms it.

**Seasonal Adaptation**  
One of the most underrated qualities of a leather jacket is its year-round adaptability:

* **Cooler months:** Layer it over sweaters or hoodies for warmth without sacrificing style.
* **Spring and summer nights:** Use it as a lightweight outer layer that elevates even the simplest T-shirt-and-jeans combination.

Opt for classic cuts like the **biker jacket, bomber, or racer style** in black or brown for timeless appeal. With proper care, a leather jacket becomes not only a style statement but also a lasting investment.

# Building Endless Combinations

By owning these four essentials, you unlock a world of outfit possibilities. Imagine the mix-and-match potential:

* White dress shirt + tailored suit = power dressing.
* White dress shirt + jeans = effortless smart casual.
* Leather jacket + jeans = modern edge.
* Suit jacket + jeans + white shirt = polished yet approachable.

Each piece works as a building block, ensuring you’re never at a loss for what to wear. Instead of filling your closet with fast fashion, focus on these staples that combine sophistication, functionality, and timelessness.

# Why Minimalism Works

The modern man’s lifestyle demands efficiency without sacrificing style. A streamlined wardrobe:

* Saves time when getting dressed.
* Reduces clutter and decision fatigue.
* Prioritizes quality over quantity.
* Ensures every purchase has lasting value.

At **La Mode Men’s**, we believe minimalism in menswear isn’t about limiting yourself—it’s about refining your choices. By curating essentials, you create a personal brand rooted in confidence, consistency, and elegance.

# Conclusion

**La Mode Men’s has distilled the perfect wardrobe into just four essential pieces: a crisp white dress shirt, a timeless tailored suit, classic denim jeans, and a statement leather jacket.** Together, they form the foundation of modern men’s style. Each piece is versatile, timeless, and adaptable, capable of evolving with you across seasons, settings, and stages of life.

Elevating your wardrobe doesn’t require more—it requires better. When you invest in quality essentials, you invest in yourself. Every outfit becomes a reflection of refined taste, confidence, and understated elegance.

Step into the world of [La Mode Men’s,](https://lamodemensclothing.com/) where style meets simplicity, and timeless fashion becomes second nature. **Elevate your style, embrace minimalism, and build a wardrobe that works as hard as you do.**",1,1759755733.0,LaModeMens,0,1.0,False

1nzif5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nzif5i/the_smart_coffee_machine_that_almost_broke_our/,The Smart Coffee Machine That Almost Broke Our House,"I swear, for a solid month, the fancy, app-controlled coffee machine sitting on our kitchen counter was less a symbol of modern convenience and more a monument to my escalating frustration. Every morning, I’d wake up, pull out my phone, and dutifully brew coffee for myself, and often, Liam and Chloe too. But when the gourmet beans ran out? Or the water filter needed changing? My phone was the only one getting a notification. My internal monologue was a lowkey scream, compiling a mental list of all the passive-aggressive ways I could communicate, ""This isn't *my* coffee machine, it's *ours*.""

It all started innocently enough. We’re in our mid-twenties, living in a vibrant co-living apartment, and we decided we needed a ""shared upgrade"" for our space. Liam, our resident tech enthusiast, immediately wanted a high-tech smart speaker system. Chloe, always the pragmatist and budget-watcher, argued for a better, more efficient vacuum. I, honestly, just wanted decent coffee, so I championed a new machine. After a surprisingly intense debate, we compromised on an espresso machine that connected to our phones, could be programmed, and, crucially, ground fresh beans. Liam was hyped about the tech, Chloe approved the cost-per-cup saving, and I was just excited for the caffeine upgrade. Ngl, I felt like we’d achieved peak housemate harmony.

But then, the execution. I was the one who researched the best beans, set up the app, connected it to the Wi-Fi, and even watched YouTube tutorials on descaling. Liam just used his phone to order a latte from his room. Chloe, after her initial budget approval, just… drank the coffee. I found myself replenishing the beans, ordering filters, and being the sole ""barista,"" while everyone else enjoyed the spoils. No cap, I was highkey feeling like a glorified coffee servant. The other morning, I woke up to find the bean hopper completely empty, a passive-aggressive Post-it from Chloe stuck to it: ""Out of beans!?"" That was it. I was ready to throw the whole machine out the window.

Instead, I took a deep breath. Later that evening, I called an impromptu house meeting. ""Okay, so, about the coffee machine,"" I started, trying to keep my voice even. ""I love it, we all do. But I'm feeling like I'm the only one actually *managing* it."" Liam looked up, genuinely surprised. ""Oh, man, my bad! I just assumed it was, like, self-sufficient."" Chloe, looking a little sheepish, added, ""Yeah, I honestly never thought about the beans or filters. That's so valid you feel that way."" We talked it out. We decided on a rotating ""coffee captain"" for the week, responsible for checking supplies and ordering refills. We also set up a shared pot in our expense app for coffee-related purchases, ensuring no one person was shouldering the cost.

The change wasn't instant, but it was significant. Now, when I open the app to make my morning brew, I see whose turn it is, and the bean hopper is almost always full. We even started having actual conversations about different coffee roasts. The smart coffee machine, which almost sparked a housemate revolution, became a symbol of how much better things are when we actually communicate and share the load. We’re still figuring things out, for real, but we’re doing it together. We love to see it.

[Sage Barista Pro + DF54],"So I'd like to start this by saying I do know how to kinda taste espresso, I've been making coffees a while so i know about slurping it so it reaches all the parts of your mouth but I want to dive deeper so let me explain my situation.

I've been making coffees for about 2 years, I know most of the theory behind it regarding dialling in so that's absolutely no issue at all. my issue is more tasting it and knowing for a fact what needs done to improve the taste. I'm totally fine with getting espresso in Ballpark range of being right but usually I know the coffee has more to give and I want to start going down this route. I've seen a few thing for tasting.

**Long Black + Espresso**

This idea being the espresso gives you the full kick and the long black waters it down to allow you to experience the tasting notes more.

**Cortado Split**

I like the idea of this the most because I love flat whites and cortados and this seems to be somewhere in the middle but also lets you try the espresso too.

Let me know what yous think, I'm open to any advice",2,1759755656.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1nzidxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1nzidxr/working_with_him/,Working with him,"So we worked as a Media team for an event during this weekend. He was a videographer and I was the social media manager. The shifts were 10-11 hours long but I'm going to try and keep it short. Also just so you know I've had a crush on him for almost a year now.
There are a few people that will be crucial in the story so here are the code names:
My crush/videographer - Blackberry (he)
Video editor/my friend - Apple (she)
Photo editor/ my best friend - Orange (she)
Photographer/basically our boss - Pear (he)



Day 1
We started of not talking for the first half of the day. We haven't really talked that much since the beginning of the school year. We had luch around 1pm but it was like not that good so Apple thought of ordering food and since I was the only one who had an app for ordering the food I paid for it. Apple chose something from Burger King so we all had to choose something from there. Orange and Pear said they were good but Blackberry agreed to also order some food. (I feel like it is important to say that my love language is giving; like not only some gift but literally anything!) After he chose what he wanted, I chose mine and ordered. Apple and I went to puck up the order. Funny thing is that Blackberry and I both chose Fanta (the only soda I can tolerate the taste off). I also shared my onion rings with everyone. 

After that Apple wanted to make like one of those short interviews for a reel. She asked me to go record it with her to what I responeded with ""Why don't you ask Blackberry? He's the videographer afterall!"" To what he immediately raised his head. We started discussing the questions but ended up on ChatGPT and instead of asking it to give us questions to ask people she typed in ""who is [my full name]"". Blackberry was watching along. Next she asked who he was, then herself, then our coworkers and some of our classmates. And after some laughing and talking they stood up to go and record the reel and then she realised she's got no question, so I asked ChatGPT on my phone to give us questions which we ended up using. I had to go with them since Blackberry was using Apple's phone to record the video and mine to record the audio and read the questions. So I was just beside Blackberry the whole time we were recording the interviews. The first one (which was a fail becaus ewe didn't record the audio on my phone) he would keep turning to me and smile and say that this will turn out horrible. I just smiled back. 

That's pretty much the end of day 1 when it comes to interactions with him.


Day 2
He was late. We were supposed to be there before 9am. He came at 9. He sent a message in our groupchat asking if he was late and I replied with yes. He asked ""weren't we supposed to be come there until 9"" and I said ""yes but it would be nice if you'd come a little earlier than that"". His next text was ""I hate myself"". He turned up there and said good morning (which he didn't do the first day as I've noticed). 

He asked where Apple is so that she could format his SD card on her laptop. He ended up doing that on mine laptop as I was sitting at it. He was basically leaning next to/over me. Immediately after that he went to do his job. Later, when we had a little break, he gave me money for the order but I felt really bad when he started like putting all the coins on the table so I just told him he didn’t have to. He responded with ""I will buy you a coffee at school"". Like I kniw it's not a big deal but I don't know, I found it sweet.

So I built — [https://viewstartup.com/](https://viewstartup.com/)  a simple, founder-submitted world map of startups. First week: \~4,000 page views and founders are already pinning their startups. I’m shipping features that (I think) every founder will want.

# Early lessons

* **Make contribution effortless.** Every extra field kills conversions.
* **Show value before asking.** Let people explore first; then invite them to add.
* **Traffic comes from conversations, not just links.** Short demos + comments > generic posts.

# What’s next (founder-friendly features)

Without spoiling surprises, I’m building things I wish existed when I was launching:

* **Founder profiles** with lightweight social/contact options (opt-in).
* **Simple filters** (category, stage, remote/onsite) and **alerts** for new nearby/startup-in-your-niche.
* **Plus more....**

If you’re a founder, these should make it easier to **get discovered** and to **find peers/customers** faster.

If you want to be on the map, add your startup here: [**viewstartup.com**](https://viewstartup.com/) it will cost you only 1 coffee.

A quick question about energy drinks. I recently read they got a bunch of negative effects. Now, I'm no expert so I thought I'd ask somebody smarter because you can't believe everything you read online. Does anyone have any experience with energy drinks and how they affect you if you lift weights? I've been drinking these things for years, honestly can't tell the difference but then again I got nobody to compare myself to. I drink the sugar free kinds because I'm terrified of gaining back all the fat I've lost since I started working out again. I drive for living and a lot of the driving takes place at night so on my first day off as well as during working hours I down a few of them just to keep going when coffee just don't cut it anymore which is why I started drinking that stuff in the first place.

1nzia1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_royaltyandcoffee/comments/1nzia1a/my_fantasy/,My fantasy!,"My name is Brittany, or Britt, I’m 27, single and I live in a beautiful apartment complex called the Cascades. I am a very successful career woman for 27, I make really good money and have a really cofmrraoble job where I mostly work on my laptop from my apartment or nearby coffee shops. My second floor balcony is my comfort place, but it’s also where my deepest darkest fantasy has taken control of my mind, and soon my life.

See the Cascades is full of very hot, very fit young men. These 18-22 year old guys are so strong, so fit. They are mostly gym bros, you know the kind with little furniture in their apartments, who are constantly gaming or having parties, who probably have incredible stamina. I’m addicted to sitting on my balcony and watching them walk by in the small courtyard to the complex gym.

But even more so, I’ve started going. That’s quite an achievement when I was never an athletic girl. I played basketball some in my younger years but I was a benchwarmer. But now I’m finding myself on treadmills everyday. Thats when I first saw him, the chief gym bro. He seemed smarter and more flirtatious than the rest. He also had a definite dominant streak I wanted to know more about. I’d always been submissive, but this fantasy was taking it to new places.

I spent some of my admittedly high discretionary income on very cute lulu and fabletics activewear and tried to look my best going to the gym. I flirted with him as much as I could and tried to look sexy where he could see. I’m not a sexy woman. I’m short with a big ass and fat thighs, a smaller stomach with a  little squish I call
It, B32 boobs and medium length light red hair that highlights how pale my skin is. 

Finally though, it was a Friday night, the work week was over, I eagerly went to the gym dressed in a blush pink sports bra and yoga shorts set and tennis shoes. We got to talking and before I even knew it, he asked, “want to come back to my apartment with me?” I smiled happily and followed. We walked past my balcony into the apartment building next door to mine and into his place. It was exactly like I fantasized, an Xbox I think on the ground next to a big tv, a couch, a chair, nothing else really.

He turned, “I know what you want Brittany, but let me be clear, I don’t want a girlfriend, I want property. Do you understand?” I didn’t really, not fully, but I nodded. This fantasy was twisted and making me comply.

“Good, then prove it. Tits out, tongue out, hands behind your back” I hesitated, then obeyed without a word, lifting my sports bra up just enough to reveal my slightly sagging small boobs. He took a few pictures of me, “my boys might want to see this too” he said smiling at me with a manipulative, amazing smile.

He slowly pulled off his sweaty tank top, captivating me with his performance. His muscular body teased me. But only for a second. Before I realized it, he had placed it over my head, blindfolding me with it loosely as I smelled his sweat closely. I felt something press into my stomach. 

“Listen Brittany, this weekend, you’re staying here, we’re going to see if you’re worth my time even though you are so old, ugly, and desperate. Do well, this can be your whole life. At least until I move. You’ll do what I say, when I say it. If I say suck, you suck, if I say, dance, you dance. If I say cook, you better do it well. If I say pee, you listen. If I say to spend your money on a slutty outfit, you will and you’ll wear it on your balcony for me. If I want you to show off your boring old pussy for other girls or my boys, or tape it shut and serve us, you will. Are you up for all of that? Now’s your last chance” 

I didn’t hesitate this time. “Yes sir” I said. It felt humiliating but I knew this was my deepest need. 

He removed the tank top
From my head and I saw, looking down, the words “property of ____” written in black across my soft stomach. 

“Thank you” I whispered. 

“You’re welcome, now this cock needs your attention”

I glanced at him and saw he’d also stripped naked. His cock was HUGE and I eagerly dropped to my knees ready to worship it with my life. ",1,1759755327.0,u_royaltyandcoffee,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arsenal vs. West Ham United: A Tale of Two Knees and a Traitorous Midfielder**  
*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Tell a Backpass From a Backpack*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over West Ham on October 4, 2025, wasn’t just a win—it was a statistical execution. The Gunners dominated possession (62% to 38%), completed 600+ passes (West Ham: 287), and looked like a Swiss watch compared to West Ham’s rusty toaster. Declan Rice’s 38th-minute goal, scored against his former club, was the soccer equivalent of a former IT guy hacking his ex’s Netflix account. Symbolic? Absolutely. Respectful? Rice didn’t celebrate, but his face said, *“I’ve moved on. You haven’t.”*

Bukayo Saka’s penalty in the 67th minute wasn’t just his 100th Premier League involvement—it was a reminder that Arsenal’s attack is a well-oiled machine, minus the oil (they’re all on plant-based diets). West Ham, meanwhile, are a car with a flat tire and a GPS set to “nowhere fast.” Under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo, they’ve managed zero goals in their last three matches—less productive than a baker’s dozen of gluten-free baguettes.

Injuries? Oh, there’s a subplot. Arsenal’s Martin Odegaard limped off early with a knee issue, and Rice exited late, leaving fans wondering if the team’s medical staff should start charging admission. But even with these hiccups, Arsenal’s depth is deeper than a Wikipedia rabbit hole. West Ham? They’re so injury-ravaged, their physio might need a physio.

**Implied Probability Takeaway**: If we treated this like a betting line (which we can’t, because the match already happened—time travel’s overrated), Arsenal’s odds would be -400 (89% implied probability). West Ham? +800 (11% chance). Basically, betting on West Ham is like betting your dog will solve quantum physics.

---

**2. Digest the News: Traitors, Toenails, and Toaster Offenses**  
Let’s unpack the headlines. Declan Rice, once West Ham’s beloved captain, is now Arsenal’s emotional weapon. His goal wasn’t just a strike—it was a literary device, a Shakespearean betrayal with more oomph. West Ham fans, we feel your pain. It’s like if your barista opened a rival café and served your secret coffee-order to your nemesis.

Bukayo Saka, meanwhile, is on a historic roll. His 200th Premier League appearance? A milestone only Thierry Henry has matched. If Saka were a smartphone, he’d be the iPhone of soccer: iconic, versatile, and still getting software updates.

West Ham’s woes? Nuno’s team looks like a spreadsheet error. Their attack is so anemic, even a vending machine would have better odds of scoring. El Hadji Malick Diouf, who drew Saka’s penalty, is the closest thing they’ve had to a spark—like lighting a candle in a hurricane.

---

**3. Humorous Spin: Soccer as Absurd as a Flamingo Goalkeeper**  
Arsenal’s defense? Tighter than a tin whistle. West Ham’s? More porous than a colander in a monsoon. If Arsenal’s backline were a castle, West Ham’s would be a sandcastle built by a toddler with a time limit.

Declan Rice’s goal was so symbolic, it should be framed and hung in West Ham’s “Most Painful Moments” museum. Meanwhile, Martin Odegaard’s injury? A plot twist only *Game of Thrones* could love. Is he out for the season? Probably not, but let’s be real—Arsenal’s medical team could probably stitch up the Colosseum.

And West Ham’s new manager, Nuno? He’s under pressure like a man trying to defuse a bomb with a cheese knife. His team’s attack is so lifeless, even the goalposts are sighing.

---

**4. Prediction: The Verdict from the Future (Kind Of)**  
Despite the injuries, Arsenal’s depth, form, and Saka’s supernova brilliance make them the clear pick. West Ham, under Nuno, are a work in progress—like a IKEA cabinet without the instructions or a hammer.

**Final Verdict**: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham. Unless West Ham’s luck improves (as likely as a penguin coaching the NHL), Arsenal stay atop the table, and Rice’s former club stays buried in the relegation zone. Bet on the Gunners, unless you’re into dramatic, last-minute own goals… or time travel.

*And remember, folks: In soccer, nothing’s certain except death, taxes, and Declan Rice’s ability to haunt his old team.* 🏟️💥

I’m new to the hobby trying to identify my flavors “palette”.
I bought a ceramic Gaiwan a with it the seller gifted me with a sample of Feng Huang Dan Cong Ya Shi Xiang and after some brews I noticed that something was off, I hypothesized the roasting.
Then I bought an anxi tie guan yin lightly oxidized and roasted and the result is the same…I perceive that I bought a high quality tea but still there is  something off with the aroma.

Yesterday at lunch I ordered a restaurant a tiramisu an immediately I understood what was off…coffee flavor.
I don’t drink it and in my entire life i can count in one hand the times I had one…so I’m not used toto it.

So my questions are:

Most of the oolongs have this aroma profile since most of them are roasted?

Are in china oolong popular because can be seen a clone of western coffee?

I don’t know, probably I just have to not continue to drink oolong one those 2 packets are finished.

227g tub Rodda’s Cornish Clotted Cream
½ tsp vanilla essence

But would like to branch out and add some flavours. I did a coffee one last time and it was great, but somebody at work requested some chocolate fudge.. my questions are; 
1 *would it be best to use cocoa powder or dark chocolate?* 
2 *how much cocoa powder or dark chocolate would I need to add? and with that...*
3 *would I need to adjust the other ingredients to make it work?* 

I can't find advice online when googling as I'd like to stick to the clotted cream as the dairy. I hope somebody can help! Thank you 🙏",3,1759754741.0,CandyMakers,0,1.0,False

I study nearby so it is my go to cafe given na mura drinks and okay yung place proper for me. Since last same there was this cute guy from another school. He wears glasses and always wearing a jacket. At first, I just noticed him as a cute guy that's all but since I keep on going there, I always see him din. Until I developed a crush on him. I told my friends about it and they keep on telling me na I should approach him. I JUST CANNOT. Like I had the biggest opportunity one time because we were sitting near each other and I plan to give him snack but dear lord I just could not bring my self to do it. I am afraid that what if he finds out that someone likes him to his fave cafe and stop going because he's weirded out, I do not want to be the reason for that. However, I made a decision that the next time I see him, I will write a letter and tell him that I am interested on him containing my contact number ig, have the staff or I, personally to give the letter and leave immediately. That was my plan for weeks now but it has also been weeks since I haven't seen him and I just finished my exams so I'm not going to BFC quite recently.

  
LOL I just wanted to vent this out because I have never has a crush that I need to yearn this much. I do not even know his name. I'm not even sure of the name they called out for his drink. DAMN I feel like a child crushing. I just either hope that we make progress or find out more about him if he's single or not then I'm good LOL IDK I am so frustrated mann.

  
Also if you know that it is you and you are here then this is an indirect confession LOLLL.",0,1759754708.0,baguio,2,0.5,False

Must I find fault in myself for finding my heart yearning for your presence?

I have always been a man of reason and logic. With a firm stance, I believe everything in this material Cosmos is explained in the language of equations and theories. Yet emotions always evade justification, for without valid reason, I somehow found myself longing for you. Though I refuse to yield to this incidental stroke of Fate, my heart crying out for you somehow feels simultaneously void of explanation yet the only singular truth that it defines. There was no valid reason why I should; this is not to say you are not someone deserving of care, but for the simple reason that I believe our rationality should not yield to our heart's desires. I somehow refuse to submit to the Fates that befall all of us. Fight as I do, my senses slowly give way to my sentiments as the days pass. Every day, the sun rises and sets, and every day I face the inevitable fact that I find myself falling deeper for you. 

I try so hard to dismiss this tender affection of mine for you. From it, I run away, I avoid, I shun to the deepest depths of my mind. Yet, just as vines climb up trellises to seek the warmth of the Sun, so does this affection of mine climb up the pillars of my soul to seek your radiance. In the natural order of things: sand falls grain by grain in the hourglass, the Sun races its way across the vault of heaven, waves caress the shores; and with no intervention of my own, so does this tender sprout of affection I have for you slowly growing within me, it's as if my soul blooms with longing for you. My mind has always ordered my heart to run away from what it wishes to seek; but my heart just one day defied all rationality, stopped, and faced what my soul desires. I have now found myself in a paradox, and that the harder I force myself to run away from you, the harder my soul fights to seek yours.

Where my mind contemplates whether it was probably an incidental mistake that it found itself yearning for you, my heart knows certainly without question that it wishes for you. My heart knows you, as eyes know the Sun, as a compass knows north, as a soul knows its reflection. Amidst a multitude of strangers, lost in a sea of faces, my heart always recognizes yours.

Though these words remain unspoken, the joy of knowing and recognizing them is enough. Whether or not you will ever know the extent of my own devotion, in your eyes I have found happiness nonetheless. If ever my silence betrays me, let it be known that within it lie not vanity and emptiness, but oceans of thought, prayers, and quiet devotion that belong to you.
 
Know that though words may fail, the echoes of my thoughts inside the cathedral of my soul always reverberate with certainty that it always speaks of your name. If one were to ask me how I know that my heart desires for you, I would have no answer. And even if I scour the whole Universe, there will be no understanding to this; there is no rational explanation but only the unyielding one true emotion, and that it existed spontaneously and now refuses to leave. For it stays, and it glows with a longing light; soft, yet ever-present.

Currently, The local council is hoping to build a VLR network but not only do I see VLR as an overdone bus and completely pointless (I think they’re doing it as it’s more likely to get funded) but also their plans only consist of 3 lines focusing around Stoke, Hanley and Etruria despite the urban area being so much bigger.
This is why I propose a 6 line lattice network so that all the lines connect each pottery town to each other without the need for transfers. I’d also build a mainline rail station at Etruria with regional trains every few minutes connecting to all places across the midlands. I would also give this service boost to Longport station so people from all of the pottery towns can get to most big cities in the midlands and north west with just one change from tram to train.
I would have the lines extend to beyond the potteries, specifically to Keele university, Leek and Biddulph. The furthest extending line would be line 2 (red) which would operate as a tram train to Blythe Bridge, then serve Alton Towers and Uttoxeter, to alleviate traffic on the country lanes near the park.",5,1759754435.0,Staffordshire,1,0.86,False

I believe in love that doesn’t need Felix Felicis to feel lucky, the kind that grows from shared laughter, late-night talks about life’s mysteries, and small, thoughtful gestures that feel like magic in disguise. My love language? Quality time, soft touches, and acts of care that whisper, “You matter.”

I’m not searching for a prince with a broomstick, just someone who’ll match my pace under the moonlight, maybe tease me about my Muggle music taste, and remind me that love, at its best, is just a really good kind of spell. 💫

If you’ve made it this far, consider this your invitation, send an owl (or, you know, a message). 🦉✨

1nzhvqv,https://i.redd.it/64f1hkwkjhtf1.jpeg,Tesco ISN’T price gouging,"A see a lot of posts on Reddit and other social media platforms claiming the high grocery prices are due to price gouging and profiteering by the likes of Tesco.
This is just not the case, as you can see in the chart above.
Tesco’s margin has actually gone down slightly since 2018. People also need to realise that even though profits have risen this is due to higher revenue and the fact that money is worth less. Tesco’s 2024 profit (£ 2.3bn)is worth £1.8bn in 2018 money.

Our groceries have gone up in price not because of Tesco being greedy but because:
- We import 40% of our food and seen our currency decrease in value
- Extra costs caused by Brexit
- Inflation of labour costs
- Increased energy costs
- Ukraine war
- Extreme weather and disease affecting crops like wheat, cocoa, coffee and olive oil. Cocoa for example has gone from $2,200 a tonne to over $7000 a tonne in just 5 years.

1nzhsfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nzhsfq/aio_guy_is_making_me_uncomfortable_at_my_job/,aio? guy is making me uncomfortable at my job.,"i'm not fully sure how to explain this, but here we go-
i (20f) work at a drive-thru only coffee shop. i have a regular customer that comes in every single morning(male in his 30s? unsure of his age), purposefully coming when i'm alone in the store. he does come on my days off as well, but just a quick in-and-out. when he comes while i'm here, he doesn't let me speak unless i'm spoken to. he keeps me at the window (yes, i can just close the window and walk away, but what if i'm overreacting and he's just trying to be nice?) until he decides it's time for him to leave. he also says ""you make my morning every morning"" all the time.

one of my coworkers is so sweet, she always handles him whenever she's around. she works overnights, so sometimes she's still working when i get here in the mornings. she told the guy that i am in a relationship and that i'm also going to be very busy and won't have much time to talk. any chance i have, i have someone else take care of his order and cash him out. 

a couple weeks ago, he showed up at one of my school events. i did not invite him, but there's a possibility i mentioned the school thing. my teachers & department chair are aware, so he will not be allowed to come back again. 


my biggest issue is that he hasnt actually *done* anything to make me feel unsafe. i am just so uncomfortable around him. one of my other regulars, who has become a good friend of mine, tries to come in around the same time as the other guy does, but they never show up any time near eachother😂

note- my managers are also aware, but they are not offering any solutions. just to try to avoid speaking to him. 

please let me know if more info is needed, i'm just hoping for some advice. i will be letting the cops that come through know if i need to, but as i said nothing has actually happened yet.

1nzhsa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1nzhsa5/is_it_burnout_or_is_it_actually_moral_injury/,Is it Burnout? Or is it Actually Moral Injury?,"I was introduced to the concept of Moral Injury in late 2019 when I was working as a clinician with kids in the foster system.  
My administrative supervisors kept using the term burnout and managing self-care, scolding us for doing our notes off the clock or answering emails they sent outside of work hours (evenings / weekends) 
They also supplied us a company cell phone so… 
I had a great clinical supervisor (thankfully) and she brought up the fact the caseloads were ridiculous and I and the other clinicians were doing our best to meet the unfair expectations.  She even highlighted how Medi-Cal (Medicaid for California) was a terribly broken system and totally outside my power to fix.  

Anyways, I bring this up to share the following information: 
How to Recognize Burnout and Moral Injury Early

Listen to Your Emotions: If you feel drained, hopeless, or detached from your work, these are signs of burnout. If you’re conflicted about acting in ways that go against your values, you may be experiencing moral injury.

Identify the Source: Burnout often results from overwork, lack of support, and unrealistic expectations. Moral injury usually arises from witnessing harm or being pressured to act in ways that violate your ethics.

It’s NOT AI generated I copied this from https://www.positivemotioncounseling.com/milwaukee-therapy-blog/understanding-burnout-and-moral-injury-recognizing-the-signs#:~:text=How%20to%20Recognize%20Burnout%20and,an%20important%20step%20toward%20healing.

To simplify it even more, if you are tired and need a break, take it.  Give yourself an extra off day a few times a quarter and do a staycation, massage, swimming, sleep an extra 3 hours by sleeping in or going to sleep early… get that self care and to he’ll with the bosses.  

BUT… if you are second guessing your worth, your decision to ever enter into this helping field… if you feel powerless to help your clients because they need more than the therapy we are trained to give and insurance won’t cover more… 
If you have thought of going back to school to finish your math courses and become an adjunct math teacher at Community College teaching algebra and Pre-Calculus to “actually make a difference…”.  

Maybe that one is just me… 

Anyways, don’t let a broken system (low insurance reimbursement, low wages in group practice, low income in non-profit CMH contracts, or the coffee-grinder-that-is-county/community mental health) take your love for helping people.  Recognize the broken system, stop blaming yourself for a broken system, and take steps to meet your own needs.  

If our clients came to us feeling like failures we find places they are succeeding and shine a light on it.  Do the same for yourself.  🙂

1nzhs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1nzhs5y/whats_the_point_of_all_this_being_interesting/,What's the point of all this being interesting stuff?,"Nowadays it seems everyone is an artist, a sports person, a traveler and a member of several clubs at the same time. I am somewhat passionate about these things and try helping out in one club, but I'm really not interested or motivated to put effort into any of this. It's not like most people are especially good in any of these fields, and it costs enough money that you then have to carefully plan all your costs. I never had an interesting life, but I do have a few good stories and don't see why I \*should\* be motivated to do anything more than just work, daydream and occasionally go grab a coffee, beer or do some easy but fun sports. I \*would\* like to organize some parties, but since most people won't show up and many people I know don't even want to go out like when they were teens, I'm not sure if there's a point (I still will sometime soon).

Besides that I'm focused on my programming hobbies and daydreaming about my visions and ideas of progress. I do like to both chit-chat and go deep into philosophy, but since I don't do things others do in a way they do them, I guess I'm not really interesting to them?

Sometimes people don't even respond to a hello. I don't get invited to hangouts and I don't have real dates (I don't even get to meet new women often). People \*do\* go on 1-on-1 drinks with me (both male and female friends), sometimes they even initiate it and several people have told me I'm cool and smart, so at least I guess I'm not that unlikable. I am moody though, and hate my life. Despite that I try to stay positive, give people emotional support and advice and always be friendly, probably more than I should, but it seems some people only trust me less because of that. But why is that a problem? What I'd consider an interesting life is either fantasy or would get me to jail, so what's wrong with just living and thinking? Why do people say I have to be more interesting or that I'm difficult? Why are they so cold to me?

I'm pretty sure most of them are just faking it, and don't see the point of it.",1,1759754025.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. ABIS - Pull Me Under / Blue [DIVIDID]**  
*Recommended if you like: Camo & Krooked, RageMode, Tom Finster*  

Deciding who to feature on here is always a battle between the pure quality of the release and how much I've been wanting to do a deep dive on the attached artist(s) over the years. Quality always comes first, of course, but it definitely helps if I, or other outlets, haven't talked about the artist twenty million times already, or if I'm just enamored with their discography. With this absolutely gorgeous double single of his, **ABIS** made this decision a very easy one, allowing me the rare opportunity to talk about one of the most talented, kindest, most down-to-earth and straight-up funniest people I have the pleasure of knowing and that this scene has to offer - let's talk about Mark McCann! 

**1.1. A Background In Sickness (2000 - 2012)**  

You might already know that ABIS wasn't Mark's first stint in DnB - we'll get to that - but if you're like me three days ago, you might not know just how far this musical rabbit hole actually goes! Growing up, the British lad was already living out the musical life by playing in bands, one of which apparently being ""This Time Tomorrow"" if Discogs is to be trusted here, but it was him getting his feet wet _behind_ the scenes, by starting a Hardcore Punk imprint at only 16 years of age, that really kicked things into gear for him. Not only was the label, to paraphrase him here, _surprisingly successful_ for his first stint, one day his local work even lead to attention from the mainland, in the form of Dutch band **Deluge** sending him their _Spot In The Shadow_ CD for consideration - Mark was absolutely blown away. Right away, he got in contact to organise a tour through the UK before the CD was bound to hit the shelves. As soon as Mark climbed into the band's tour van on the infamous M25 motorway, they hit it off, becoming great friends immediately. 

While Mark dug deeper into the life of Hardcore Punk and live music in general, working in music theatres and pulling the strings behind all sorts of shows for up-and-coming bands, him and Deluge guitarist **Bart Van Dijk** - that's why I mentioned that whole band story above - also started to fall in love with this thing called Neurofunk, after listening to Noisia's _Moonway Renegade_ one too many times. So much, in fact, that they soon after fully _ditched_ Punk, and instead got into electronic music production to create their own Neuro smashers. In 2007, they unveiled their collaborative effort: **June Miller** was officially a reality. 

Immediately voted best up-and-coming act at the now-defunct Dutch DnB Awards, they quickly soared to local success, and once 2009 rolled around, they finally started to share their own creations with the world, via the _Horizons_ imprint. Fun fact, Horizons seems to have quite the reputation nowadays, but at the time it meant their music got to more and more ears, one of them being Renegade Hardware's very own _Loxy_, who spotted their immense potential and signed them to his _Cylon_ imprint in 2010. With that and further output on _Vampire_, _Inneractive_, _Buried_, and _Deep Soul Music_ alongside _Anile_, they built up the courage to enter a massive Dutch music competition the following year. Having reached the finals with ease, hopes for a gold medal were incredibly high, but once the day rolled around, they walked away empty-handed. While still processing this depressing reality check, they received the message that would change _everything_. Dun dun duuun.


**1.2. Andy Seeing Their Potential (2012 - 2018)**  

That's right, none other than _Andy C_ was in their AIM inbox asking for tunes! While still debating whether it was a fake account or Andy simply reaching out to half the scene with a copy-pasted message, they sent out the best stuff they had at the time, and lo and behold, the executioner absolutely loved it, and wanted to sign them for an album deal! After recovering from having their tunes stolen, slightly edited and sent out all over the place - they found out about this one when they suddenly saw their supposed dubs being played out in a livestream they were watching - they came back even stronger: Not only debuting on the legendary late three-lettered label on its Dimensions EP series, alongside names like _Cyantific_ and _René LaVice_, but also making their Mark (hehe) on Critical's _Modulations_, in collaborations with _Nymfo_, _Mindmapper_ and _Dabs_, and by remixing one of _Enei_'s earliest tunes, all while still honouring their Punk roots through their band-referential track naming and their work with _Secret Handshake Club_, all in just 2012! 

From there on out, the training wheels were entirely removed, and the dynamic duo, with Mark having moved to The Netherlands in the meantime, tore through success after success, remixing the likes of _Black Sun Empire_ and _Delta Heavy_, working with then-newcomer Mefjus on the era-defining tune that was _Saus_, all leading up to the release of their debut album, _Robots & Romans_, in 2015. As one of RAM's more unique talents, they showed a side of the label that made them truly great at its height, taking on collaborations with the likes of _Maztek_, _Teddy Killerz_, and a young _T & Sugah_, and even becoming what I'm just going to call a sonic ambassador for the one and only _Let It Roll_, not just giving musical life to the opening show's story about robots and planets and wormholes or whatever, but also being the actual epic voice of the show - you know, the one that went _IMMORTALZZZ_! That was Mark! 

However, not too long after, in early 2017, the duo announced that June Miller would come to an end once the calendar struck 2018. They would only play the remaining, already booked shows, and anything additional they could squeeze in before New Year's, and only a couple of the very last releases would trickle out over the following months, including various _James Marvel_ joints and the still huge _Dominator_. They also promised Saus VIP, but you know how that one turned out. 

**1.3. DIVIDID but not conquered (2018 - 2025)**  

Lucky for us, June Miller ending didn't mean that Mark was stopping, to the contrary! In 2018, he unveiled his new solo venture: **ABIS**! Together with new kid on the block _Signal_, of later _IMANU_ fame, they delivered not just another remix for the Blackout head honchos B S and E and one of the opening tunes for Let It Roll Winter's show, but also the iconic _The Wall_ EP - released on their freshly founded label, **DIVIDID**! Additionally, Mark also debuted the new project on Eatbrain on collab duties with _Zombie Cats_, composed another tune for LiR's summer edition, and created a whole, actually banging soundtrack for the VR game _Space Pirate Trainer_ with _James Marvel_ - you should have seen my face when I realised this while waving around the controllers of my coworker's VR setup.

Further ahead into 2019, Let It Roll opening show duties were still being pursued, alongside remix works for _Pythius_ and _3RDKND_, and group projects with new names like _MISSIN_, _Volatile Cycle_, and _DLR_, and familiar ones like _Signal_ and _Zombie Cats_, with the latter one being an entire EP, which some of you might know as _ALL4U_. 

And then... nothing! For a time, it really seemed like that was ALL he had 4 Us. Sure, DIVIDID was still thriving, as it has always been, with shows all over Europe, releases pushing some of the very best talents in the scene like _Tom Finster_, _Synergy_, _Grey Code_, _Lukher_, and even now outright legendary names like _The Caracal Project_ and _Buunshin_, all with truly excellent artworks that a lot of the time he and his partner Joyce, nowadays under the **Negative Plus** brand, so artfully crafted, but his own music project was mostly silent. Of course, he was still pursuing music in his day job, crafting film scores you have very probably heard, but it would take until _2023_ for the ABIS project to actually return from the admittedly titular abyss of nothingness. From his Blackout single _Grains Of Suna_ to remixes for _Pythius_ & _Burr Oak_ and _Tom Finster_, to the outstanding _Hass_ with _Maysev_ earlier this year, it has been a rare but all the more real pleasure to have him fully back like this. Now, he brings us, spoiler, two absolute _stunners_ - so let's please talk about them! 

**1.4. Pull Me Under / Blue**  

As if being thrown into one of the more dramatic parts of Mozart's _Zauberflöte_, we're stepping into a wonderful world of orchestral bliss and techy mastery, on **Pull Me Under**. In no time, the quirly woodwind instruments lead us into the beaming sunlight of entire string sections fluttering throughout the air and providing us with a bed of pure sonic comfort, before opening up the beauty even _further_, to a place where both brass and a glistening plucky synth, flowing through time and space like water, have their place to shine. Out of this beauty, a darkness emerges, in the form of an all-consuming reese, that trips up even the lovely vocal for a second, before it recovers itself just time for the insanity about to be unleashed. As the vocal dances its most beautiful and catchy dance, Mark digitally conducts a whirlwind of destructive yet tensely controlled breaks, synchronised to most wonderfully wide synths firing off all over the place, and taking us through multiple lifecycles, starting, stopping, and restarting, of its mind-boggling rhythm. As this one continues, we go into straight-forward rolling drums, with the strings and bass returning in some of their glory, before breaking it down entirely, fully focusing on the vocal and the contrasting, threatening basses announcing the imminent second drop. As if all this loveliness wasn't already amazing enough, we are also treated to an actual, proper outro, with harps, flutes, strings, and probably more and other instruments all wrapping us in the blanket we so desperately need, after struggling in the water for so long.

Continuing the theme of orchestral storytelling with a bit of a darker turn, **Blue** quickly amps up the tension with triumphant brass that grows and grows into outright unsettling proportions, as if witnessing the arrival of a foe so large we cannot even perceive its size anymore. Fading this teaser out to a tense string note, we once more build up into a cacophony-but-good (google tells me it's ""euphony"") of humming choirs, vocal snippets, and plucky strings turning more and more synthetic over time, to the point they steamroll the rest of the composition, with only the vocal, reduced to an even shorter loop, remaining. Once it manages to briefly break out of that loop, we launch into the smoothly rolling drop, where the plucky synths roam freely, growing and shrinking in waves, while strings and brass sections fill out the space in most wonderful fashion, taking turns with the vocal in its mission of loveliness. What follows, however, might be the real star of the show on this six and a half minute long journey: dramatic string sections, brass drawing closer and closer, the return of the synth™, a cut-out to unveil a cute little piano, a dramatic reveal with even more instruments added into the mix, big splashes, big drums, everything coming together - before gently leading us into an even smoother, roller of a second drop. Once more, we of course get a _lovely_ warm outro, bass wrapped all around us, brass piping up one last time. Oh, how I love all of this!

**1.5. Conclusion**  

This isn't even _close_ to your typical drum & bass release, I can't stop talking about this. The perfect layering of straight-up gorgeous pieces of orchestral magic, the amount of control over tension and release, the detours and journeys we go on in here - all while still working in the framework of incredibly sick, techy DnB. Mark McCann do simply no wrong I'm afraid.

1nzhqzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitiveeating/comments/1nzhqzu/trying_to_control_my_caffeine_intake_is/,Trying to control my caffeine intake is triggering the same kind of nervous breakdown I had whilst dieting,"I’ve made a few Reddit posts about this over the past week or so but I feel like this is the right place to discuss this properly because y’all probably get it. 

So I have tonnes of health conditions that mean watching my caffeine intake is a good idea for me and honestly a few months ago I was gung ho about quitting completely. I made it two months and felt honestly great, amazing, woohoo etc but then I had a bad day and drank a strong black coffee and I was instantly  hooked again. For the past month or so I’ve just been mainlining double shot black coffees at all hours of the day chasing the dragon lol. For reference, I don’t even like the taste hahahahaha

My issue is that I genuinely do want to drink less caffeine and be less dependent on a drug to survive so I thought why not switch to green tea? But that binge behaviour is still there and I keep waking up each day with a completely different anxiety fuelled goal about my caffeine intake, JUST like how I used to act when dieting and counting calories. Like my conscious and subconscious mind want different things? I tried switching to green tea and on the first day I found myself double bagging and drinking it every two hours which just led to me being sick as a dog because of how harsh it is on my stomach! 

Has anyone here found that they need help with intuitive eating practises when it comes to things like caffeine drinks? It kind of straddles the area between “food” and “drug” so it’s hard to get a handle on for me. ",3,1759753944.0,intuitiveeating,3,0.8,False
1nzhpw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/drfreeware/comments/1nzhpw0/still_rocking_windows_7_heres_how_to_clone_your/,Still Rocking Windows 7? Here's How to Clone Your HDD to an SSD for a HUGE Speed Boost,"https://preview.redd.it/d4ji5vl2lhtf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0aa61cde2ac91998f7161274be9a7d2f50b1292

Is your old Windows 7 machine feeling painfully slow? If you're staring at the screen for over 90 seconds just waiting for it to boot up, you're not alone. The fix is simpler than you think: clone your old Hard Disk Drive (HDD) to a modern Solid State Drive (SSD). We're talking boot times dropping to under 15 seconds and files transferring 3-10 times faster, according to 2025 benchmarks. If you searched for “clone HDD to SSD Windows 7,” you’re in the right place. This guide will walk you through safe, easy methods—from free tools to pro software like Renee Becca—perfect for beginners. Skip the hassle of a fresh install and make your old PC feel new again!

>Just a heads-up: Windows 7 officially stopped getting security updates back in 2020, which means your PC is more open to risks over time. When you're picking out an SSD, double-check that it's compatible with Windows 7 to avoid any headaches during installation or performance issues down the road.

# Preparations Before Cloning Your HDD to SSD on Windows 7

Alright, before we dive in, getting a few things ready will make this process a whole lot smoother. It'll ensure your Windows 7 system moves over to the new SSD without a hitch, keeping all your stuff safe and bootable.

Here’s what you’ll need:

1. A stable Windows 7 PC—trying to clone a buggy system is just asking for trouble.

2. A compatible SSD: For most PCs from the Windows 7 era, you'll be looking for a standard SATA SSD. Some might use M.2, so pop open your case or check your motherboard's manual if you're not sure. Make sure the SSD has more space than what you're currently using on your HDD (you can check in Disk Management). For example, if you've used 300GB on your old drive, a 500GB SSD is a good bet to give you some breathing room.

Here are a couple of solid, budget-friendly SSDs that play nice with Windows 7 systems:

|Brand|Model|Capacity Options|Interface|Notes (Controller / Support)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Samsung**|860 EVO / 870 EVO|250GB – 4TB|SATA III|Fully supported; Samsung Magician supports Win7.|
|**Crucial**|MX500|250GB – 2TB|SATA III|Marvell controller; Win7 compatible.|
|**Intel**|545s / 535 Series|120GB – 2TB|SATA III|Intel SSD Toolbox supports Win7.|
|**Western Digital**|Blue 3D NAND / Green|240GB – 2TB|SATA III|Win7 compatible; no special drivers needed.|
|**Kingston**|A400 / UV500|120GB – 1.92TB|SATA III|Entry-level SSDs; fully supported.|
|**Samsung**|950 Pro / 960 EVO/PRO|256GB – 1TB|NVMe (M.2)|Requires Samsung NVMe driver for Win7.|
|**Intel**|600p / 660p|128GB – 2TB|NVMe (M.2)|Needs Intel NVMe driver; not natively recognized.|
|**Seagate**|FireCuda SSHD|500GB – 2TB|SATA III|Hybrid; appears as SATA HDD, works fine.|
|**Toshiba**|Q Series Pro|128GB – 512GB|SATA III|Win7 compatible; older but stable.|

👉 If you want **maximum hassle-free compatibility**, stick with **SATA SSDs** like Samsung 860/870 EVO or Crucial MX500.  
👉 If you want **NVMe speed**, you’ll need to integrate drivers into your Windows 7 install media.  
(check on sites like Newegg or Amazon for local pricing and availability)

3. Installation tools: You'll need a screwdriver to physically install the drive. Anti-static gloves are a good idea to protect your components. Installing it in a desktop is usually pretty easy, but for a laptop, you might want to look up a quick YouTube video for your specific model.

https://i.redd.it/zy2zh0m8lhtf1.gif

If you're using a laptop with only one drive bay, you'll need a USB-to-SATA adapter or an external enclosure to connect the new SSD to your computer during the cloning process.

https://preview.redd.it/pqwiamxclhtf1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a97b4db25096c94202d7ceb28bd0bcf68f5121a

4. Cloning software: You'll need a program to do the actual copying. A tool like [Renee Becca](https://www.reneelab.com/data-backup) is a great choice because it's designed to be user-friendly, handles all the technical SSD optimizations for you, and has a free trial. It makes the whole migration process super straightforward.

Once you've got all this sorted, you're ready to start cloning. We'll go through the methods from the easiest to the more technical ones, so you can pick the one that works best for you.

# Step-by-Step Methods to Clone HDD to SSD on Windows 7

Cloning your HDD to an SSD means you're making a perfect copy of your Windows 7 system, so it boots up way faster without you losing a single file or setting. We've laid out the methods from simplest to most advanced to keep things frustration-free, whether you're new to this or a tech pro.

# Method 1: Using a Hardware Cloner for Hassle-Free Offline Cloning

If you want to avoid installing any software and just get it done, a hardware cloner is your best friend. This is basically a docking station with a ""clone"" button (they usually cost about $20-50, or around ₹1,500-₹4,000). It's perfect for beginners, especially if your new SSD is the same size or bigger than your old HDD, as it does the whole job offline.

>Best for when your old and new drives have the same connector type (like SATA to SATA) and the new drive is the same size or larger.

https://preview.redd.it/b93yirwdlhtf1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b1ab7ba16f3cea145af3816c7fe70111fe05146

**Steps**:

* Plug your old HDD (the source) and new SSD (the target) into the cloner.
* Hit the clone button and grab a coffee. It can take anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes, depending on how much data you have.
* Once it's done, install the new SSD in your PC. You'll need to go into the BIOS (usually by pressing Del or F2 when your computer starts) and tell it to boot from the new SSD first.

Folks on Reddit often praise this method for being fast and simple, with some reporting a 1TB clone finishing in about 40 minutes. However, it does a perfect 1:1 copy, so it's not ideal if your SSD is smaller than your HDD. It's also usually limited to standard SATA drives. If you're dealing with different drive types (like an old IDE drive or a new NVMe SSD), software is your best bet for more flexibility.

Let’s move on to software options for more control.

# Method 2: Using Third-Party Software for Smart, User-Friendly Cloning

For most people, using software is the way to go. It gives you way more flexibility, like resizing partitions to fit a smaller SSD and making sure the drive is optimized for performance right out of the gate.

We recommend starting with **Renee Becca**. It's a pro-level tool that's super easy to use, even for beginners. It has a free trial, makes cloning a one-click job, and automatically handles all the important SSD tweaks. Plus, it supports multiple languages, which is a nice touch. It's way faster than the built-in Windows method and will make your system feel 5-10x snappier.

# Step 1: Download and install Renee Becca on your PC/laptop.

[Download Now](https://www.reneelab.com/download-center/renee-becca?src=reddit)

# Step 2: Use suitable functions to transfer your data and system.

Renee Becca gives you two main ways to clone, depending on what you need:

|Function Name|Feature|Suitable For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Hard Disk Clone/Clone System Disk**|Makes a perfect copy of your entire drive. You can easily adjust partition sizes by dragging the slider. The cloned disk will be bootable.|Replacing your old hard drive completely with the new SSD.|
|**System Redeploy**|Moves only the Windows operating system partition to a new drive.|Setting up a dual-drive system (e.g., SSD for Windows, HDD for files) or just moving your OS.|

**Option 1: Clone the Entire Drive Using the “Hard Disk Clone” Feature**

If your old HDD has everything on it—Windows, programs, and your files—use “Hard Disk Clone/Clone System Disk” from the “Clone” menu to copy it all over.

https://preview.redd.it/nkcnmszqlhtf1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb3681623f2616f7a3fbf39ff72c807b9f115c3

**1. Pick Your Source and Destination**: Select your old HDD as the source drive and your new SSD as the destination.

https://preview.redd.it/xwfgk3h1phtf1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=a934b9ac56e6830725ad6062e484fde46d9d2959

**2. Adjust Settings and Start Cloning:** You can choose “Copy all sectors” if you have special software licenses tied to the drive. Renee Becca works with all kinds of drives and even lets you resize partitions on the new SSD by simply dragging the edges.

Click “Clone” to get the process started.





If you only want to move Windows 7 to the SSD and leave your files on the old drive, choose “System Redeploy” under the “Clone” tab.

https://preview.redd.it/wm0w323ulhtf1.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a0171c9eda7d6c8f9085f3ea1c7c45f43a58baf

Just select your system partition as the source and the new SSD as the target, then click “Redeploy.”

# Step 3: Wait for the progress bar to reach 100% to indicate successful migration.

Depending on how much data you have, cloning can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Once it’s finished, your new SSD is good to go.

>**Important Note**: Your new SSD must have enough space to hold all the data from your old HDD's used portion. Also, the cloning process will wipe everything off the new SSD, so make sure you've backed up anything important on it.

# Step 4: Verify your new drive status with tools like CrystalDiskInfo.

After the clone, it's a good idea to double-check everything. Use a free tool like **CrystalDiskInfo** to check the health of your new drive (this can help spot fake or faulty SSDs).

https://preview.redd.it/alm9fedxlhtf1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=9088e8a75e892043322417429625b32476be13ba

Then, run **CrystalDiskMark** to see those sweet, sweet new read/write speeds and confirm the upgrade was a success.

https://preview.redd.it/39rqnt0ylhtf1.png?width=1893&format=png&auto=webp&s=7058dbe00a776206d12877de21ae12557f15622f

While Renee Becca is a solid choice for its simplicity, if you're looking for free alternatives, **Macrium Reflect Free** is a long-time favorite with a simple interface. **Hasleo Backup Suite Free** is another great, fast option for those on a tight budget. For more advanced users, **Clonezilla** (which runs from a USB stick) or **DiskGenius** (which has powerful partition tools) are also powerful choices for Windows 7.

If you’d rather not download anything, Windows 7 has its own built-in option.

# Method 3: Using Windows 7’s Built-In Backup and Restore Tool

>Before you start, connect an external drive with enough free space, then go to Control Panel > Backup and Restore > Set up backup to get it ready.

If you'd rather not download extra software, Windows 7 has its own ""Backup and Restore"" feature. It's free and gets the job done by creating a complete ""system image"" that you can then restore to your new SSD. But honestly, it's a bit clunky and old-school. It doesn't handle SSD optimizations like partition alignment or TRIM, and the whole process can be pretty slow.

>What's TRIM? Think of it as a command that keeps your SSD running fast and healthy. When you delete something, TRIM tells the drive which blocks are now empty, so it can clean them up ahead of time. This makes writing new files faster and helps your SSD last longer. It's essential housekeeping for an SSD.

**Steps**

1. Open *Control Panel > Backup and Restore*, and click *Create a system image*. Save this image to an external hard drive.     Back up your computer
2. Boot your computer from a Windows 7 installation disc or USB, choose *Repair your computer > System Image Recovery*, and follow the prompts to restore the image onto your new SSD.     Boot from your Windows 7 installation media, choose Repair your computer > System Image Recovery
3. Restart your PC, enter the BIOS, and set the new SSD as the primary boot device on the *Boot* tab.

# Latest Notes (2025)

Based on recent guides and forum posts from 2025, people who use this method often run into a couple of common snags:

* **Partition Size**: After restoring, the system partition might not use all the space on your new, larger SSD. To fix this, open *Disk Management* (type `diskmgmt.msc` in the Start menu), right-click your C: drive, and select *Extend Volume* to claim the unallocated space.     extend volume
* **Boot Configuration**: Sometimes, the PC won't boot from the new SSD. This is usually a boot record issue. To fix it:     
   * \* Make sure your BIOS is set to the right boot mode (Legacy BIOS for older setups).     
   * \* Boot from your installation disc again, open the Command Prompt, and run these commands to fix the boot files:
      * `bootrec /fixmbr`
      * `bootrec /fixboot`   
      * `bootrec /rebuildbcd`            
* \*  Some users find it easier to use a free tool like *EasyBCD* to repair the bootloader with a simple graphical interface.

# Heads‑Up

The bottom line: This built-in method is really only for older, BIOS-based systems. If your machine supports UEFI, you'll save yourself a massive headache by using a modern cloning tool that handles all the boot records, partition alignment, and SSD optimizations for you automatically.

If you hit a wall, here’s how to troubleshoot.

# Advanced Troubleshooting for Cloning Issues

Even with the best tools, sometimes things just don't go as planned. Cloning can fail because of disk errors, partition problems, or boot issues. If that happens, here are a few things you can try:

# 1. Check for Disk Errors

* Open *Command Prompt* as an Administrator (right-click and choose ""Run as administrator""). Then type:

`chkdsk C: /f /r`    

This will scan your old drive for errors and fix them. Try cloning again after it's done.

# 2. Verify and Adjust Partitions

* After cloning, open *Disk Management* (`diskmgmt.msc`) to see if all the partitions copied over correctly.
* If you see ""unallocated space"" on the new SSD, right-click the main partition (usually C:) and select *Extend Volume* to make it use the full drive capacity.
* For best performance, SSD partitions need to be ""aligned."" If they're not, you can use free tools like MiniTool Partition Wizard or GParted to fix them.

# 3. Fix Boot Configuration

* If your PC won't boot from the new SSD, start it up using your Windows installation disc/USB and open *Repair your computer > Command Prompt*.
* Run these commands one by one to rebuild the boot records:

`bootrec /fixmbr`     

`bootrec /fixboot`     

`bootrec /rebuildbcd`    

* Also, make sure the boot mode in your BIOS/UEFI matches your drive's partition style (Legacy BIOS for MBR drives, UEFI for GPT drives). A mismatch is a super common reason for boot failures.

# 4. Enable AHCI Mode

* A lot of discussions on forums like SevenForums in 2025 point to this as a key step: enable **AHCI mode** in your BIOS *before* you clone. AHCI is a modern standard that helps SSDs perform their best, much better than the older IDE mode.
* To switch safely, go into your BIOS, change the SATA mode from IDE to AHCI, and make sure the right driver is enabled in Windows before you restart.
* (refer: https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/windows-7-wont-boot-on-ahci-mode-after-ssd-install.3101886/)

# 5. Consider Drive Health

* If you keep getting errors, use the SSD manufacturer's own software (like Samsung Magician, Crucial Storage Executive, or WD Dashboard) to check the drive's health and see if there's a firmware update available. Sometimes a simple update can fix compatibility problems.

# 6. Confirm TRIM is active

TRIM is crucial for keeping your SSD fast and healthy. It lets Windows tell the drive which blocks of data are no longer in use. Here's how to check if it's on:

1. Click ​**Start**​, type `cmd`, then right-click **Command Prompt** and select ​**Run as administrator**​.

2. Enter the following command:

    fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify

If the result is `DisableDeleteNotify = 0`, you're all set, TRIM is **enabled**. If the result is `1`, TRIM is disabled.

3. To enable TRIM, run:

    fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify 0

You should see a confirmation message. Now your SSD will manage deleted data more efficiently.

# Optimizing Windows 7 After Cloning to SSD

To get the absolute best performance and life out of your new SSD, make these two quick tweaks after you've cloned:

1. **Disable disk indexing**: Right-click your new SSD in My Computer > Properties > Uncheck the box that says “Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties.” SSDs are so fast they don't need indexing, and turning it off reduces unnecessary wear.
2. **Turn off defragmentation**: Go to Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter. Click “Configure schedule” and uncheck “Run on a schedule.” SSDs should never be defragmented; they use TRIM to stay organized and fast.

These simple changes will help your Windows 7 system fly on its new drive.

# Windows 7-Specific Considerations for HDD to SSD Cloning

Since Windows 7 is officially ""end-of-life"" (no more security updates since 2020), it's getting riskier to use online. While an SSD makes it way faster, you should also think about your upgrade options. Upgrading to Windows 10 is still a solid choice in 2025 and will give you modern security and better hardware support. By contrast, Windows 11 probably isn't an option, as most old Windows 7 machines don't meet its strict hardware requirements (like TPM 2.0).

Before cloning, it's highly recommended to enable AHCI mode in your BIOS for the best SSD performance and compatibility. After cloning, double-check that it's still enabled. This setting is key to letting your SSD run at its full potential.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

# Will cloning my HDD to SSD delete data on my original HDD?

Nope! Cloning is a copy-paste process. Your original HDD will be left untouched. That said, it's always smart to have a backup of your super important files, just in case something unexpected happens.

# How long does cloning HDD to SSD on Windows 7 take?

It really depends on how much data you have. A hardware cloner can be as quick as 10-60 minutes. Software tools like Renee Becca or Macrium Reflect usually take between 30 minutes to a couple of hours. A 2025 TechRadar test clocked a 250GB clone at around 50 minutes, so that's a good ballpark. (refer: https://www.techradar.com/best/best-disk-cloning-software)

# Can I clone to a smaller SSD than my HDD?

You bet, as long as the stuff on your old HDD can fit onto the new, smaller SSD. You might have to shrink the main partition on your HDD first using a tool like Disk Management. Good cloning software like Renee Becca often lets you do this easily during the cloning process itself.

# What if my cloned SSD doesn’t boot?

Classic issue! First, double-check that you've told your computer's BIOS to boot from the new SSD (usually by pressing Del or F2 on startup). If that doesn't work, you can use your Windows 7 installation disk to run 'Startup Repair.' Also, as mentioned in a lot of recent Reddit threads, make sure you enabled AHCI mode in your BIOS *before* you started cloning. That fixes it for a lot of people.

# Can I use the cloned SSD in another computer?

Probably not a good idea. Windows 7 licenses are tied to the motherboard, so moving the drive to a new PC will likely cause activation problems and driver nightmares. It's best to keep the cloned SSD in the computer it was cloned for, as confirmed in a 2025 Microsoft Community forum. (refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3887030/how-can-i-activate-my-windows-after-cloning-my-loc)

# Is cloning to SSD worth it on Windows 7 in 2025?

100% yes, for the speed alone. People see their boot times go from a minute and a half down to 15 seconds. It's a massive quality-of-life upgrade. Just remember that Windows 7 isn't secure anymore, so while you enjoy the new speed, start planning a move to Windows 10 for better protection. Windows 11 is likely out of the question for most old Windows 7 hardware.",1,1759753860.0,drfreeware,0,1.0,False

1nzhoj2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzhoj2,Race Report: Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon - A 32 Mile Mess (Longest DNF in Marathon History?),"**TL;DR:**  
  
Aiming for a 3:40. Accidentally took the half marathon finish path at mile 11, realized it too late (after crossing the half finish line), and rejoined the marathon ultimately running 51.43km and finishing in 4:42:07.   
Stick around for the story of the dumbest man in the Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon this year!

# Pre Race

I was a bit unsure about how I would do going into this marathon. I finished rehab and had about 3 months before this oddly early race. I was also just about to move back home to Milwaukee after almost a decade overseas, so we’re already starting on pretty unstable ground. High stress situation, training in the middle of the Tokyo summer with 100+ degree days and then trying to adjust back to Milwaukee life during this training block. Not to mention I was in Italy the week of for a wedding and got back stateside the Thursday before the marathon.

I knew going into this marathon I was going to be struggling to maintain balance in life and running. I still was able to hit about 90-95% of the runs in this 3 month block (Pfitz 12/55), but definitely had to make a few concessions when it came to my target goal time and manage my expectations a little bit. I really want to try to push for the sub 3:30 marathon, but was having a hard time imagining getting the fitness to run a consistent 4:50-5:00/km (8:00ish/mile). So a target of 3:40 was what I was aiming at for my finishing time and thought it was pretty reasonable.

Moving countries AND a destination wedding the week before did prove to bring some challenges. I’ve been dealing with a groin issue when running (brought on by weak glutes) and did my best to work on them with strength training, but just didn’t have the time to really get it in a solid spot. I spent 2 days in Italy after the wedding, walking around the city and absolutely exhausting the hell out of my legs mere days before the marathon itself; I should’ve worn my running shoes to walk 40k steps instead of the flat Nikes I wore. So I wound up only running a short 11k the Tuesday before the marathon and then a really lame 3k the night before that felt ROUGH. I figured that I’d already built the fitness, just let my body heal, but that short shake out run had me not feeling very confident.

# Race Day

I stayed the night with a friend downtown who was running their first marathon and we’d be going in the morning together. We chatted about what was bothering us physically and both weren’t that confident going in. Since this was my 3rd marathon I was used to the lack of confidence and anxiety we all feel before a marathon, but had previously hit my goal and knew that bodies have amazing ability to stabilize during these types of moments. And that’s exactly what happened.

I was feeling really good the morning of the race. I woke up early, drank my coffee and had my breakfast, did a poo and felt like I could make it the whole way without needing to stop for a bathroom break; which is always a point of worry for me.

# Race Start

From what I heard on the megaphone, there was about 4500 people running in the half and full marathon that day and with it starting in the middle of downtown, it was pretty crowded.

It took us 10 minutes to get to the start and with almost no time to think, we were off.

First few kms were slow just trying to get around everyone, but I slowly started to pick up the pace and was hitting sub 5:10/km until we hit the Hoan Bridge; which is a 2 mile bridge with about a 3.5% grade to it. So not too steep, but definitely long. That said, I hit just over 5:10/km on the climb and cruised on the decline.

Once I made it to the end, there was a turn around right away and everyone was cruising into it to head back over the bridge.

“Already? I thought it ends in Veterans park.” I thought. Veterans park is directly at the entry/exit to the bridge, but I figured that maybe we would be headed back into the city and loop back around.

The second climb of the bridge wasn’t too bad and I was so into the moment, the energy of the crowd and all the people who, like me, were still cruising along. I was shouting inspiration at the people still climbing and even saw my friend who was on the climb! I shouted out to him and he gave me a weird look, but I just assumed it was because of the climb.

I finish the bridge and turn right into the crowd. My name is called and suddenly I’ve passed the finish line.

….

“Wait what? Where am I? I’m doing the full. Where is the full?”

No one knew what I was talking about obviously and I had to in moments realize that not only had I gone off course, but that I’d finished already. They called my name and to start back up again meant I had to get BACK on the bridge…

But in that moment of panic and frustration I decided to turn back, run back to the race and gut this thing out. I was running my own race now. I jetted back up the bridge out of frustration and got back to the run. So many thoughts rushing through my head and a lot of emotional progress made during that remaining 30km, but I’ll get to that in the wrap up.

I was able to gut out the 42.2 and got a 4:40:56. So my race was over, but I still had another 9km or so left. I spent that time walking and running a bit. I finally put some music on and was texting family and friends to let them know that I would be a bit late to the finish line.

Also along the way I talked to a guy who was walking around the time I started walking. Maybe in his late 30s and in really good shape, but he was also walking. I asked what part of his body had failed on him. Turns out he’s had some intense shoulder and back issues and that running has become a lot harder as he’s gotten older, but he was still out there, getting roasted in the hot October sun like the rest of us. It was nice to talk to someone else who was not in an ideal situation, but totally cool with a walk run after giving it their best. Bradley, if you’re reading this, thank you for keeping my mind away from myself for that mile or two.

So I was happy enough that Strava would have the recording of the run and that I did put in the 42.2km and could at least look at that in the future.

# Post Race

I made it to the bottom of the bridge for the third time and heard someone shout out. My mom was there taking a photo. I was so annoyed with myself and embarrassed. “You came all this way to see my biggest failure?” Is what was going through my head at that moment.

Instantly found my friend, we embraced and caught up on what had happened. They had a great race though and finished with a better time than they were shooting for(!), which is amazing.

So in the end I ran a total of 51.43km and finished with a time of 4:42:07. Which I have to assume is the longest DNF ever completed in marathon history.

# Emotional Wrap Up

I still don’t really have the words for how I was feeling once I realized what I had done, but there was obviously a lot of frustration and just so much embarrassment. I’d guess I was the only one of the 4500 runners that did that yesterday and this was easily the biggest bed-shitting I’ve ever done in my over 30 years on this earth.

Mom came by, snapped a pic, said she was proud and all I could do was put myself down and talk about how frustrating it was. I couldn’t even really enjoy that it was over all I could think about is just how silly I felt and that now I was going to have to tell everyone what happened and just the weight of that alone sort of made me wish I’d not run at all.

During that back 30km I was doing, I didn’t listen to much music, instead opting to try and reflect in the moment on what was happening and how I could simply move on from something like this.

I’d trained for months for this. I stopped drinking. Said no to late nights with friends so I could do my Sunday long runs. I paid the money. I loaded the carbs. But I also didn’t lock in as hard as I could/should have either. I overate, I didn’t keep up with my rehab stretches and missed some leg sessions at the gym. These are all things that contributed to this race preparation and what ultimately goes down as one of the funniest/unique moments of my life.

As I mentioned earlier I want to someday hit that sub 3:30, but knew that this wasn’t the race where I could push to the limit. This was just a step to that goal and that I’d come back for the next one with some more fitness and a less hectic schedule. After all, 3:40, while a decent time for my age, isn’t qualifying me for anything and is just a fairly normal race. Now I have a 3:40 (unofficially), but what’s more, I have TOTAL confidence that with just a little bit more training, that sub 3:30 is achievable. That thought alone made this whole thing a lot easier to reconcile with.

So I got the medal, despite the DNF and I feel even more motivated to get that sub 3:30 next time.

Now what’s a good training schedule so I can get that in Tuscan or Phoenix this December?

# Lessons Learned

While I’ve still gotta get used to the taste of humble pie and have to find a shorter way to tell this to all my friends who have now been waiting a whole day to hear what happened to me; I feel extremely blessed to even have these feelings.

As I was running the marathon after the mess up, I was so frustrated and embarrassed hearing the “Keep pushing! Don’t give up!” or the look I thought people had on their faces of “wow, this guy is all dressed up and barely gunna crack 5 hours”. Had they known I’d just done an extra trip over the bridge and that I was the biggest idiot on race day, maybe they’d feel bad for me.

These were all such silly and irresponsible thoughts. No one knows what the runner next to them is going through. Is it their first race? Are they dealing with some injury or other unseen issue?

Obvious as it may be, but everyone’s going through their own thing and fighting their own battle. I think my split second decision to get back out on the course and just huff it out is the same thing that pushes all of us to even run in the first place. For the vast majority of us it’s not about getting the best time ever or even a time to qualify for a major. It’s about seeing what we’re capable of and the limits we’re able to push ourselves to.

On top of that, and this is where the gratitude comes in, I had a great week. I saw a great friend getting married in Italy and then ran a marathon with another great friend all in the same week! I got the time I wanted (more or less), got the medal and also have the most ridiculous story to tell for the rest of my life; I couldn’t have asked for a better mistake.",10,1759753757.0,Marathon_Training,3,0.92,False

He was the kind of boy people warned you about — not because he was dangerous, but because he didn’t believe in goodness anymore. Arjun spoke in sarcasm, lived in half-slept nights, and carried a kind of tired arrogance that came from pretending not to care. His phone was full of unread messages, his smile, rehearsed. He called it “freedom.” Others called it loneliness.

That afternoon, he stood at a crowded café counter, tapping his foot impatiently. The barista got his name wrong again.
“Arjun, not Arun,” he snapped, rolling his eyes. “It’s literally written on the cup.”

From behind him, a soft voice floated in — calm, like sunlight through rain.
“Maybe it’s not the coffee’s fault,” she said with a small smile.

He turned, ready to argue, but froze. The girl had this quiet warmth — the kind that made chaos stop mid-sentence. She wore simple clothes, her hair slightly messy from the wind, and her eyes — they didn’t just look at him, they saw him.

He stared for a second too long. “You always defend bad coffee?” he asked, smirking.

“Only when someone bullies it,” she said, gently stirring her drink.

For reasons he didn’t understand, he laughed — genuinely, the kind that feels like breathing after being underwater too long.

⸻

Over the next few days, he kept bumping into her — at the same café, the bookstore across the street, once even at the park where he went to be alone. Her name was Aanya. She was studying psychology, which he found ironic.
“Trying to fix broken people?” he teased one evening.
She smiled. “No. Just trying to understand why they stop believing they can heal.”

He didn’t know it then, but that line would live rent-free in his mind for weeks.

Their conversations were strange — half teasing, half truth.
He’d say, “You’re too nice, it’s suspicious.”
She’d laugh. “And you’re too guarded, it’s predictable.”

Slowly, she became his calm in a world that constantly felt too loud. He’d find himself texting her things he’d never said out loud:

“I don’t know why you make life feel less heavy.”
“You’re bad for my image. I smiled twice today.”

And she’d reply with a single emoji or a quote from a book — always soft, never possessive.

⸻

But the thing about people like Arjun is — they don’t know how to stay when something feels too good. One night, after a stupid argument about “expectations,” he disappeared. No texts, no calls. Just silence.

Days turned into weeks. She didn’t chase him.
Instead, she left a note at his favorite table in the café —

“You don’t need to destroy good things to prove you don’t deserve them.”

That line broke him more than her absence.

⸻

Months passed. Arjun tried to unlearn his habits — the anger, the pride, the fear of being seen. Healing wasn’t dramatic; it was dull, slow, and quiet. But it worked. One morning, he looked in the mirror and didn’t flinch.

And then — life being life — he saw her again.

At the same café. Same table. Same messy hair, same calm smile. She looked happy. Peaceful.
He hesitated before walking up.

“Still defending bad coffee?” he said softly.

She looked up, surprised, then smiled — not with nostalgia, but with peace.
“You finally look like someone who sleeps well,” she said.

He laughed, rubbing his neck. “Took me a while to learn what peace looks like.”

They didn’t hug or cry. They just sat there, two people who had finally learned that love isn’t always about possession — sometimes, it’s about becoming better versions of yourself because of someone who believed you could.

The coffee was still terrible that day.
But somehow, it tasted perfect.

My Why for IF.","I was overweight at 5 feet 8 inches with a 40-inch waist. Like many others, I started intermittent fasting to lose weight. After experimenting with different timings, I settled on 16:8 as my minimum. Four months in, I lost 7 inches around my waist. One random morning after a long walk on my way to home, I poured myself a cup of the worst instant coffee available. As I sipped it, I thought to myself, ""What a life I have."" What more does one need than long walks and some coffee? That moment made me realize I was no longer depressed.

I was doing all the things people say to do when you're depressed. The difference was I was doing them because I wanted to, not because I had to. Going outside, light runs, enjoying workouts, calling friends to make plans and sipping that instant coffee made me realize my depression wasn’t caused by something or someone. The happiness I now felt for no reason came from the same place. Both my depression and my happiness for no reason stemmed from the inside.

That is why I committed to intermittent fasting as a lifestyle. I don’t believe IF cured me, but something definitely shifted during those four months. My depression was in remission after losing those 7 inches. This was during lockdown, and for two years I was in the best shape of my life. Things started to go downhill when I returned to the office. I’m struggling now to keep the discipline with eating. I had owned my time and rhythm before. Now I’m working on making that lifestyle happen again. Consistency is my biggest challenge.

* Even just syncing up with friends for coffee

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", fit, latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, reading, singing, dancing, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movies. I'm in Brooklyn (can't host, unfortunately), but can easily make my way to you or a place to meetup. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions.

1nzhjwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzhjwn,Rescued: Euro 2000,"Hi everyone,

I recently bought a broken Euro 2000 E61 machine. The seller stated that the boiler overflows, and I thought it might be an easy fix. But when it arrived (last picture) it had multiple issues.

Indeed the boiler overflowed until water came out of the anti-vacuum valve. But additionally the overpressure valve was closed completely (a gasket was missing), the 2-way solenoid valve was put directly behind the pump (and in the wrong direction) so it could not control the way between boiler and group head. The group head copper pipe was replaced with one out of plastics, put in the wrong spot and also the check valve was leaking.

Oh and the issue of overfilling the boiler was simply a broken ground wire, see the picture!

And some minor other things... The good news were that the heating element was okay, the boiler was not leaking, and all the other parts were dirty but in good shape. And the electronic box was fine too.... So it seemed like a reasonable idea to fix the machine.

Everything was installed correctly (place and direction), the missing pipes were replaced, everything was cleansed and decalcified, I completely disassembled the E61 group head and replaced the gaskets ... and now, after putting everything back together (first picture), I have a nice machine which will easily make great coffee for another decade or two.

Most likely not for me though, I forgot a bit how big E61 machines are, and how long they need to heat up and so on... couple of years ago I downgraded to smaller machines with small boilers, and I am happy with them. Nevertheless, it was a fun project, and the machine looks pretty cool and will make someone else happy soon.

At first, I found it very difficult to operate the lever, so I decided to take the machine apart to examine its condition. The inside of the unit was indeed very dirty, so I cleaned it and took the opportunity to change the piston seals and lubricate it, which solved the problem.

I am now faced with another problem: I feel that the machine is overheating and I would need some expert advice to be able to move forward.

I will try to give some details to help with the diagnosis:

First, I switch on the machine and after 5 minutes the boiler pressure rises to just over 1 bar and then remains stable.

I wait a little longer, then push the lever upwards to bring the unit up to temperature. Immediately, the temperature rises to between 95 and 100°C and the water comes out with a lot of steam.

I have read that to lower the temperature of the unit, you should let it run for several seconds and that the jet should be free of steam. However, no matter how long I leave the lever up, the temperature does not drop and the water continues to flow with just as much steam until the boiler is empty...

Could there be a malfunction in the machine at this stage?

Thank you for your opinions!

5m and 4 almost 5 f.

She has had these children 5 years now. My gf is 25 years old I am 27.

I have my own child who is 5.

I met her at a baby group she only had two little baby's under 2 at the time. Literally these kids are 7 months apart ( youngest was a very premature baby I can't remember how early and it isn't my place to ask )

These children are not my gfs but her mums children.

She had up and left thr children with my gf and never came back.

I honestly thought she was a young mum with her hands full we had gotten close in the baby group she uses talk to me alot as alot of mums iced her out ( she was new to the area )

I asked her out to coffee and we struck up a friendship that lead to a relationship.

Now when we was friends I only saw her during the baby group she just went silent any other time 

I found out she was looking after 4 kids and struggling as she was only on a single person benefit ( no child benefits no child element just a single person money which was something like £700 at the time) her mum was claiming all thr benefits for the children and not actually looking after the children.

Fast forward I helped my gf secure herself and the children. I helped her with social services as she was too scared to tell them her mum had left her completely in this new town a month prior and ditched her. ( yes she is a adult but she was 20 and only agreed to move yo be with the kids as her mum was awful to them)

My gf got full custody of the children and she's a great mother ( I'm sorry but she's been rasing those children longer then their mum she deserves to be called their mum )

This is the issue, her mum is back on the scene. And is pregnant again. 

She has come back into my gf life saying she got no where to go and she doesn't want this child ( she's 7 months pregnant) and can't my gf look after this one too.

My gf has gotten in touch with social services over this and it is said her mum Is heavily addicted to drugs social services are involved and will basically take this baby at birth due to pregnancy neglect ( I cant remember the actual term they are using )

My gf wants to take this baby on she feels like it's her job to do this. This baby is family after all.

This child will be born via c section soon and will be placed in nicu while the baby is detoxed thus child will no doubt have some issues.

Mt gf has said she will take this baby on aswell but I'm worried about her, she is depressed deep down. She loves her brothers and sister she even loves my son and treats him like her own just like with everyone. But she wants freedom she wants to live a little she wants the chance to carry her own child and be a (mum) she also wants to live a little like she hasn't really had a proper date ( yes u know this is my fault buy we are very busy with work social services family doctors ect by the time 9pm rocks around we are both either asleep in the sofa or ready to just go to sleep )

I'm so worried this will just cause her depression to get worse.  ( she doesn't look depressed she doesn't act depressed she has chronic depression but she's the happiness person in the world and I'm worried she's hiding it alot and asding a baby with maybe complex needs will mean she will have to put her life further on hold ( I know she will say she doesn't mind and she will live when they are older and she's still young. But sometimes I catch her looking at her phone or the tv with young people like us having fun and you can see that want in her eyes but she will never admit it )

I just need advice on what to do how to help her.

I won't try and change her mind over this baby but I want her to live a little still she's so chilf and family focused thst she's lost herself alot in the process ",2,1759753057.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

1nzhe93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/1nzhe93/neuroborreliosis_recovery_42day_water_fast_as/,Neuroborreliosis recovery: 42-day water fast as healing intervention,"Disclaimer: This is my personal experience, not medical advice. I accept no liability – everyone acts at their own responsibility.

Years of neuroborreliosis left me with fragmented perception, nerve pain, and crushing fatigue. After experimenting with fasting for healing, I just completed 42 days. The neurological healing crises during and after were intense but transformative. Not medical advice, just sharing what worked for me when nothing else did.

**Prologue: The Decision**

After three winters of intensive dry fasting, I was actually feeling pretty good over the summer. I had made a resolution: water fasting once a year. For maintenance. For prophylaxis. I wrote it in the calendar – sometime in August.

After years of neuroborreliosis, you no longer trust your body. You're afraid. You know from experience that stress and overload can lead to chaos. The memories of the bad times, when I was really done for, always resonate.

At some point in recent years, I had understood: Fasting is absolute healing for me. The zero point. My body always felt better afterward, once the healing crises had passed.

So I started.

# The Goal: Until Hunger

The goal was: go until true hunger. Just as the old fasting experts consider it maximally healing. That's when the best and greatest healing occurs.

I had quite a bit of experience by now. So I simply stopped eating. I supplemented electrolytes – sodium, potassium, and magnesium in the right dosage. I had made myself a ready-made solution, of which I drank two shot glasses full every day, dissolved in water. That made it nice and easy to supplement the right amount. I'll definitely keep doing that.

Then it began.

# The First Weeks: Waves

The first week I still drank black coffee relatively normally, I still went to work, tried to be productive. That worked out pretty well. I tried to stay grounded in everyday life. Otherwise just water.

The beginning was a bit tough. Then it came in waves. There were days when I felt great – clear-headed, full of endorphins, calm, chilled. I could work. And then there were days, often several in a row, where I had pain. At first a bit of body aches, then mainly in the brain. Headaches, nerve pain in the brain. Exactly in the spot where I feel the symptoms of Lyme disease most physically when I have a bad day.

On those days I felt like my entire perception was cramped. I couldn't process anything, couldn't grasp a clear thought. They weren't the worst healing crises I'd ever had, but still. Then it dissolved. Afterward I felt exhausted but happy. Relieved. My body felt relieved – massively stressed, but recovered. Very clearly: It was a flare. My body had confronted the Lyme disease – or rather the damage from the Lyme disease. And again and again I thought: Fasting works. It really works.

I had no hunger at all the whole time. I was relatively thirsty, at least the first three weeks. That also got better – I think that has a lot to do with the electrolytes, until the body balances out. I tried to keep myself occupied. At first I listened to audiobooks, that eventually became too much for me emotionally. I started gaming, read almost only children's books, just tried to distract myself. After three, four weeks I also met up with friends.

But from week four on, my energy level kept decreasing. I was increasingly exhausted, found it harder and harder to move. I eventually stopped working. But my head was actually relatively clear when I wasn't having one of those flares.

# The Emptiness: Weeks Five and Six

In the fifth week the exhaustion became massive. I had two more intense healing crises – once I was very feverish for a few days, felt really sick. Not just the neurological symptoms, but the whole body. As if it were confronting something deeper.

The hardest thing, though, were the moments when nothing happened. The emptiness in between. That's when the doubts come. During and shortly after the crises it's actually easier, because you notice: Hey, something's happening. But in the silence, when nothing hurts and nothing moves, that's when you ask yourself: What am I actually doing here? Does this even make sense?

There's no escape, no more distraction. You encounter yourself. Very intense. All thoughts, all fears, all doubts – they're just there. You sit with yourself in a room, and there's nothing left to cover yourself with. No food, no distraction, nothing. Just you and your body and your mind.

The last days were then uneventful. Almost boring. As if the body had done its work and was now just waiting. On the evening of the 42nd day, after over 1,000 hours, something came that I had never felt before: real hunger. Not appetite, not cravings. Hunger. The body said: It's time.

# Breaking the Fast

I broke it with bone broth. An hour later the first eggs. Then the first steak, 200-300 grams. Then another egg. Then to bed. The next day breakfast: Five fried eggs. Lunch a steak. Dinner a steak and more eggs. From the first day I really dug in.

... And had no problems whatsoever. I really believe this carnivore-refeed thing is really how you should eat best. Zero problems. From the first day I ate fully and uninhibitedly according to appetite. I didn't hold back at all. No digestive or other refeed symptoms.

# The Recovery: The Real Battle

After breaking a fast like that, you're always very relieved that it's over. You also first notice how much you were actually straining yourself toward the end. It's always like that – even with dry fasting. At first full of energy. I felt good. Then came the healing crises. In waves. That's normal with fasting. I've learned to appreciate it by now. They also get milder each time. But nonetheless: You just need time afterward.

I don't know what it's like when you're healthy – for people who fast for weight reasons or spiritual reasons. But with a chronic illness like neuroborreliosis, the convalescence afterward, the recovery phase, is definitely extremely important. And unfortunately also quite painful at times.

From experience, the recovery from dry fasting was always massive. For every day of dry fasting it took three days to regenerate. With my long dry fasts – the nine-day ones – an additional 27 days until I felt: Yes, it's done, and I can tackle everyday life again. With water fasting it's similar, just milder.

I broke the fast four weeks ago. Today I'm walking through the forest to work for the first time, where I'm also recording this episode now. Six weeks fasting. Plus four weeks recovery. And today back for the first time.

The feeling you have – during regeneration: So much is happening in the body. It's insane. It takes the time. I give it the time. I feel stronger from day to day. To be honest, I actually felt relatively strong quite quickly after breaking the fast.

The only problem I still have, that was different before, are these weird neurological head symptoms. But they're better with each time. It goes through a cycle: headaches, then tingling in the head, I feel like I can't process sensory impressions anymore, then it dissolves at some point. And I notice: Wow. What just happened? Did pathogens die? Was damaged nerve tissue broken down and rebuilt? Toxins? I don't know. I'm not making any assumptions here either. I can only rely on my body sense.

# What I've Understood: Healing Hurts

Over the years I've developed a deep faith in my body. A deep understanding of what healing actually means. Healing only works by getting worse first. That's nature's only way of dealing with a pathological condition. That's part of it. That's why miracle pills don't help. That's why healing without pain doesn't work – at least not with chronic illness. It always gets worse first.

And that's okay. You have to accept that. You have to work with that. You can even be a little happy about it – even though it's painful and it hurts. But you know: Hey, you're making progress. I'm basically holding space for my body so it can repair itself. And I trust it. I trust God. He's got it under control. He shows me the way – through fasting.

# The Transformation: From Fragments to a Whole

The most intense difference is how much physical energy I have again now. And how stable my perception feels, my brain feels. When I was so sick, I felt like reality consisted of individual fragments that were all somehow dangerous. When I looked at a tree, it pixelated. I couldn't even process it as a tree. Reality, this fragment, disintegrated before my eyes into a thousand individual pieces.

After fasting – and this gets better with each fast, and now especially after this water fast I feel like it was really effective, definitely comparable to the nine days of dry fasting – I feel like everything is seamless again. Reality is stable. It's hard to describe how this feeling feels. I'd say: normal. That's how I always felt before i got sick. I can string thoughts together. I can think. When I see a tree now, I see this tree, and it just stands there as a tree. My perception is very sharp and very smooth and very seamless and very beautiful and very good.

Before it was just hell, how everything dissolved. Now I feel like my brain, my nervous system has such a stable foundation again. It feels healthy. Even though I still periodically get headaches – they're slowly getting better. I can already tell.

# Why Fasting Works, i think.

Maybe I'll tell more in another post about what kind of intuitive picture I've built up by now of why fasting is healing for the body. At its core it's a controlled wild fire. 42 days of eating nothing. The body starts to consume itself. And not stupidly, but – we have four billion years of evolution behind us – intelligently (how could it be otherwise?). In a highly intelligent way the body breaks itself down. It starts with the broken, no longer functional and diseased tissue. Dissolves it. The Body gets rid of it Then there's room for new, healthy tissue. And that's how healing happens.

It hurts when the broken tissue breaks down. It hurts when new grows. But there's nothing more effective I can do for my body. Not medications, not therapies, not supplements. But give it the space to heal itself. Trust that it can.

1nzhe3p,https://i.redd.it/2t07erpughtf1.png,[FM21: Serbia] July to September 2028 - 'Mostovi',"***Introduction***

This save has morphed into different guises as the game time has increased. I started off with the ambition of managing what was my local club at the time - Stevenage. The plan was to bring them up to the Premiership from League Two. But after a season and a half in the Championship I got frustrated with the pace of the build. So I decided I’d try a journeyman save. I resigned with no plan in mind, just the idea that I didn’t want to manage in England or Scotland. Unbelievably I ended up at Fiorentina in Italy and I stayed there until I’d pretty much won everything, losing the Champions League Final at the end of my third season in charge but winning the league and cup twice along the way, and the Europa League.

I knew I was getting bored and looking for other Football Manager challenges some time around December 2026 in game - the job centre had a few international U23 options there and I randomly applied for the Cameroon U23 job with the idea that it might be a fun distraction from winning everything with Fiorentina. It was. By the end of November 2027 I had won the U23 AFCON with Cameroon and at that stage I had just about finished a short stint with Bahia in Brazil, taking them out of the relegation places half way through their season to finish 7th in the league, bringing home the Copa Libertadores along the way (they were in the Quarter Finals when I took the job on).

The journeyman had now turned, possibly, into a Pentagon challenge. So with that in mind I resigned from Bahia and in December 2027 I took up a role with Korean giants, Jeonbuk. A condition of taking the role was to leave Cameroon U23s, which I did without really thinking about it. That U23 management role wasn’t really immersive enough. The Jeonuk Board expected me to win the league and to reach the Asian Champions League Final. They practically gifted this to me with a ridiculous transfer and wage budget. I started to get bored quite quickly as the winning felt too easy. I always intended to see out the season, but I hadn’t intended to go back to international management after leaving Cameroon U23s. But I also hadn’t realised it was Euro 2028 in game which meant there would likely be a raft of senior international management roles available at the end of that tournament. When I started regularly glancing at the job centre there were no really enticing club options available, and I knew looking before finishing the season was pointless. If I interviewed for and was offered a club job, the terms of offer would mean leaving Jeonbuk before the job was done. So, when those international jobs started appearing the day after the Euro 2028 final I started to think about taking on a nation-build and ditching the Pentagon/Journeyman for a while.

***The Job Centre***

After every major international tournament in Football Manager you can expect to see at least two international jobs become available, and following Euro 2028 there was no exception to that rule. There they were, the European jobs and a smattering of South American options too. A slow scroll through the list of international vacancies: Brazil. Spain. Holland. Poland. Serbia. Wales. Ecuador.

The one that got my interest immediately was Holland. In the league and Asian Champions League, Jeonbuk were flying. Too easily, in fact. My over-reliance on 4-2-3-1 ‘Typhoon’ had bled the excitement and unpredictability from match day. I could change from ‘Typhoon’ to two of the other tactics I’d devised but I was too numb with the winning to compromise that now. Jeonbuk had just become a click-through and I was going to click through to the end of the season, inevitably winning almost everything. Once the season was done, I could ditch 4-2-3-1 in any guise, for good. I would go somewhere else and do something else.

I saw the Holland job and I thought ‘Total Football’. Tactical innovation. Options. Expectation. Excitement. I needed something with weight again and I needed to find a narrative space that could grow. 

Ángel was outside on the hotel balcony in Jeonju with his roll-up smoke curling around him as it was most minutes of every day.

**OWL:** “So. Tactical innovation. Holland are looking. Brazil too. Spain. Serbia. Which of them speaks to you, Ángel?”

**ÁNGEL:** “Mira, hermano. The options, great options. Brazil for legend. Spain for poetry. Holland for ideas. But Serbia…Why do you mention Serbia in that same breathe?! Yes, you have history with some of their lads - Pavlović, Jevremović, Dekić, Stuparević - all of them ghosts of this journeyman life. But Serbia? That would take work. Lots of it. It would be like starting again at Stevenage in League Two.”

He was right.

Serbia had followed me through the game. I took on a young 21 year old Serbian at Stevenage when I was promoted from League Two and he stayed after I’d left. Now to be found at Astana in Kazakhstan of all places (via Birmingham?!). I built Fiorentina’s defensive reputation around a 20 year old goalkeeper picked up on a free from Partizan, and a 24 year old Juventus reject who went on to become coveted by them. The Serbian thread ran through. I’d give three lads a chance to ignite and renew their careers, and a chance to build something of themselves. The two from Fiorentina Jevremović and Pavlović were well established in the national team, Dekić who had been the back-up keeper at Viola in my last season was also a perennial in the national set-up. But Stuparević, he still only had a handful of U21 caps. He was banging in goals for fun in Kazakhstan and at 27 I thought I could offer him another chance at renewal.

So, Serbia had the narrative I always look for just sitting there and waiting for me. That job represented a chance to build something unifying, to bring together all the threads of ‘He’s here, he’s there…’ and to build a nation from average to great. There was a chance to build a Serbian football culture around unity instead of nationalism.

So I applied. I hedged my bets though. I applied for the Holland job, for the chance of glory and because of my love for their history. For Poland, because Ángel had managed and scouted there before finding his way into this story. And for Serbia.

Two called back.

# Two double-headed eagles

Very shortly after applying, both Poland and Serbia offered me a chance. On the same day. There was no option to delay the decision on either. So I was stuck with a dilemma that took a cup of coffee and some window gazing to resolve. I drank my coffee and had a chat with Ángel.

**ÁNGEL:** “Poland’s my homecoming, hermano. Nights on frozen pitches, bad coffee, worse vodka. But Serbia. It’s poetry. That’s a continuation of the story, it folds in everything built so far. It has the opportunity to light the fire again.”

Poland would have been nostalgic for him but largely meaningless to me. Serbia felt like a bridge both to the past of ‘He’s here, he’s there…’ but also a bridge into a new and interesting direction, one I’d very briefly explored with Cameroon U23s.

I stared at the screen for a moment longer, and then it clicked, and so did I: **Accept Job – Serbia National Team Manager.**

Just like that, the story shifted continents again and Owl Foxtrot and Ángel Russo were on the move.

# What’s in a name?

I have a habit of naming things in this game. Players quickly get nicknames, tactical set-ups get their own monikers and the teams I’m at often become ‘projects’ in one way or another. Stevenage was ‘The Climb’, Fiorentina was ‘Project Cathedral’. In Bahia it was ‘The Macarena’. Jeonbuk had become ‘Project Green Typhoon’. Serbia, initially became ‘Project Steel Eagle’. A little melodramatic, for sure, but it was a working title that started me thinking more deeply about the options.

The greatest idea I had was to move away from Serbian football as a vehicle for politics, for nationalism. The idea was to build a new Serbian football culture based on culture, to change perceptions internally and externally. I have always been interested in the Balkans - it’s politics, history and culture so I knew this FM project was highly unlikely to ever happen in real life. And that is exactly why I went with this as the driving principle.

Serbia had always been painted as a team of temper, of volatility. With a fanbase to match. I wanted to show the other side - organisation, intelligence, artistry, connection.

The footballing philosophy would be different from everywhere else I had been. I was bored of iterations of 4-2-3-1. Let’s face it, it’s a tactical cheat code in FM21, and especially effective when you have money to spend and some of the best players in your league, country or region. This time there would be no tiki-taka. No gegenpress. There would be no reaction to losing. Well, not in the ‘break glass in case of emergency’ use of aforementioned tactic. No, not reactionary. Instead I would create a Serbia set-up from under 18 to senior that was patient, balanced, vertical and deliberate. 

The philosophy and its tactical representation? 4-3-3 Mostovi - Serbian for Bridges. The word captured the purpose: connecting the save with its past, connecting generations through the national system, uniting systems. Building a bridge to the 2030 World Cup at first, and to a competitive fearsome side thereafter.

# Staff

The first thing I did was to put out adverts for every post I could in the back room staff. Plenty of applications rolled in. Three that stood out as coaches were:

* Slobodan Dinčić, U23s. Young, attacking, fearless.
* Stevan Bates, U21s. Organiser, teacher, patient hand.
* Branislav Ivanović, U19s. Discipline, gravitas, authority.

The next thing I did was to look at the Assistant Manager set-up. I found there were 3 in post?! Too many, and what for? I moved two to coaching and the other left by mutual consent. This then gave me the opportunity to bring in my Assistant from Jeonbuk, who also happened to be Serbian! All this Serbians, across the save. It was like it was meant to be.

In came Veljko Paunović, sharing his duties across club and country, and a man who once led Serbia’s youth to a World Cup.

# Stuparević

Filip’s was the first name that came to mind when I saw the Serbia job advertised. He was one of my first signings at Stevenage. In on loan from Watford in my first season in League One, signed on a free when we made it to the Championship two seasons later. Not  prolific, but dependable. Reliable. A great link up man, who brought the best out of those around him. One of those players everyone has in a save - the one you remember, the one you think fondly of even years later.

So, Filip Stuparević. Only capped at U21 level - 5 caps, 2 goals. Now aged 27. Still playing as a striker but no longer in England having moved to Astana in Kazakhstan by way of Stevenage and Birmingham. Birmingham paid £10.25mil for him, Astana £7.25. How was he doing in Kazakhstan? Flying. Scoring for fun. 17 appearances, 15 goals. I was glad to see that, the numbers said to me that he was worth a call-up, on merit, not just memory.

I picked up the phone.

**OWL:** “Filip, it’s me. You’re in the next Serbia squad.” *(A pause. A very long pause.)*

**OWL:** “Fil?”**FILIP:** “Thank you, man. Wow! You have no idea what that means. Are you serious?!”

**OWL:** “Super serious Filip. I’ve never forgotten how you dragged Stevenage out of League One, always remembered your moments of brilliance in the Championship. I’ll see you at camp in a week or so.”

# Belgium, Away: European International League, Division A

When I took the job I had been hoping the first few games might be a little easier, they might be at home. But no, first of all Belgium in Belgium and then on to Holland.

So, a crowd of 50,000 in Brussels. Only two or three thousand of those Serbian. The rain was slicing through the floodlights, the wind serving to make it feel much colder than it was. But not colder than Serbia in winter. The lads, when the anthem started, they stood taller and sang louder than I’d have thought possible, their voices blending into those of the travelling fans. Their Serbia. My Serbian project.

So it began. The plan was to play the full 90 using 4-3-3 Mostovi and I stuck to that just to see what it looked like under pressure. I’d said to Ángel before the game that I’d be happy with a point, even happy to lose by a goal but to have given a good account. It almost ended with an unexpected 3 points!

Šarac slotted a neat finish under their keeper in the first half. Ten minutes into the second and Belgium equalised from the penalty spot. But that didn’t seem to dampen anyone’s spirit and fifteen minutes later Lazić let rip a long range effort which took a deflection and ended up in the back of the net. 2-1, twenty minutes to go. I was tempted to pull the lads back, to get everyone behind the ball but they seemed to be holding up and holding their own. The 89th minute came and 4 minutes of time was added. My nerve broke, perhaps a little too late, and I deployed time wasting, slowing the pace down, playing for set pieces and every other trick I could think of to kill the game. It appeared to be working. But then 95 minutes came, and continued into the 96th. Then, a heart breaking moment as a lapse in concentration at the back saw Doku latch onto speculative long ball which he took to the edge of the box and blasted past Jevremović.

2-2. The game went on for another minute and in my head I’d achieved my minimum expectation in these circumstances. I couldn’t find any anger or irritation at dropping points. Although I was pissed off at the referee’s management of the clock after 94 minutes. Still, it was an initiation and it wasn’t an embarrassment.

Ángel followed me down the tunnel as the final whistle blew. I was soaked and freezing, but we were both smiling.

**ÁNGEL:** “No disappointments there, eh hermano? Those lads, they can play. They have spirit and an unexpected bonus my friend - they can sing!”

# The 74th Minute

After we took the lead in the 71st minute I decided it was time to give good old Fil Stuparević his first cap for Serbia. He came on in the 74th as the lone striker. I changed over the instruction and put him up there in his old Stevenage role - Deep Lying Forward, Support.

I laughed inside, it felt like time folding in on itself. This guy, out here sounding more English than Serbian, following me all the way here from our shared beginning. 

I expected nothing really. He was probably nervous, definitely excited. He had a few touches, and kept the game flowing in the direction we wanted. He had one real chance on goal though! The 88th minute, just making it past the shoulder of the last defender, unleashing a curling shot from the edge of the box. Inches wide. A great effort though. Maybe next time. Maybe.

After the game he told reporters:

“I’m proud. I’m grateful. The manager believed in me.”

I saw it on TV that night, alone in the hotel. I heard his words and I thought; “I always did, Fil.” I knew then that this Serbia project was going to be a long-term thing. 

# Holland, Away: European International League, Division A

A few days later and it was time to face Rafa Benítez’s Holland. Pragmatism personified. I expected one of two things. Either an absolute drubbing, or a hard tactical scrap.

It was 1-1 for most of the night. They scored in the 18th minute, our reply came ten minutes later. But then, oh then, eight minutes later cruel fate entered the stadium and found its way into the boots of Djordjevic’s boots and into the back of our own net. Half time, 2-1.

The second half was a stalemate. A stalemate I was proud to see unfold, and confident of holding on to. We wouldn’t concede again, but it didn’t look like we would score again either. 2-1 against Holland in Holland, though. Yeah, I’d take that. A fair result, made fairer by a disallowed Dutch goal in the 84th minute. Thankfully the referee and the linesman could see what everyone else could - miles offside.

Of course, Ángel had something to say afterwards.

**ÁNGEL:** “A one-goal loss in Amsterdam? No points, but look, we've just made it clear that Serbia’s not just a game to be ticked off by the bigger sides. When they face us, they have to field their best to get something out of it.”

I was hoping he was going to be right. We’d have to play Belgium and Holland again fairly soon, and we still had home and away fixtures with Ukraine to face.

# The Bridge

We left Holland with one point from two games which in footballing terms isn’t much. Usually when I have a run of fixtures like this my minimum aim is to get four. But this time around I wasn’t bothered by that. I just wanted to see what Mostovi looked like in practice, I wanted to see if Fil had what it took to become more than a one cap wonder. The point we got meant a lot. It showed that I had something to work with. It gave me belief in my new project. It helped me find joy in the game again.

I kept on tinkering with the back room staff, adding people to the machine and putting together the building blocks change. The training sessions under Paunović grew sharper, and they had more purpose. With Ángel knocking around, the players laughed more both on and off the training pitch.

The building blocks of renewal and connection were replacing the crumbling facade of joyless nationalism and political pressure. This was football as fun, but also diplomacy.

I just moved to Copenhagen and I'm looking to connect with some like-minded people!

I'm 19 years old and an entrepreneur working on my marketing agency.

Are there any other young founders, or even just people interested in the startup world or building cool things here in CPH?

I'd love to grab a coffee or a quick bite to network, share ideas, and just meet new people.

1nzhd4a,https://i.redd.it/0ipvf4pyfhtf1.jpeg,It’s Launch Day… but this is about Gratitude,"Earlier this year, when I started this journey, I didn’t think I’d come this far. I remember when I had drafted roughly 14 chapters–the furthest I’d ever made it into attempting to write a story after many false starts over my nearly four decades of life–and thought to myself “oh, maybe I should start looking into how to publish this thing.” I knew I wanted to share it on RoyalRoad, because I was a longtime reader and huge fan of the platform. That led me to finding the “Bog Standard Launch Guide,” which I’ve been following for the past four months as I’ve continued to build a backlog and get ready to release content.

I found the RoyalRoad Writer’s Guild and Immersive Ink Discord servers–two incredible communities–and a plethora of people that have passed on their wisdom, provided constructive criticism and encouragement, and ultimately made this experience so much *more* than it would have been otherwise.

It’s those folks that I want to dedicate this post to, and through that, hopefully inspire other aspiring authors to join in these communities. A rising tide lifts all boats.

So first, to **Milc (A Dragon Called Bob, and other works):** thank you for the launch guide, for helping me work through cutting my prologue, and just being One Of The Good Ones.

**Ellembri (The Hermit, The Tower, The World):** thank you for being such an encouraging and kind-hearted soul, always there with the coffee emojis and positivity.

**Ino (**[**coversbyino.com**](http://coversbyino.com)**)**: thanks for answering all of my noob questions and making one exceptional book cover! You’ve got great style, lady.

**Samwise/EllisRaine (The Third Unhuman War) & A. Bel (Nailmaker: The Reaper) & Cyeven:‌** For helping me fix up my blurb! (It needed the help).

**LJ Amber (The Elf Who Would Become A Dragon):** For being incredibly wise and knowledgeable of the craft, and business, of writing–and more than that, for being willing to share so much of that with others on Discord.

There’s so many more folks that have been of help throughout, but this post will get way too long if I keep rolling. Thanks to everyone on RRWG and INK for being wonderful.

NOW, go read my fiction: **The Sovereign’s Toll**

Or, you know, don’t. But check out the blurb and stuff:

His family was his world. Now he’s in a new one.

When a fatal accident rips Caleb Foster from his wife and kids, the forty-year-old gets a second chance in a realm of dungeons and monsters. A cosmic system offers him a choice of legendary powers, but Caleb refuses the flashy magic. He chooses the abilities to learn faster, remember perfectly, and master any physical skill.

A father's instinct to protect doesn't die with his family. To survive and shield the new lives that depend on him, he must use a lifetime of quiet competence to navigate a dangerous frontier town, hunt deadly beasts, and outwit men who mistake his lack of flash for weakness.

**In a place where might makes right, Caleb is about to show that the most lethal weapon is a mind that misses nothing, and a will that never quits.**
