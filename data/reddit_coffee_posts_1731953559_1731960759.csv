Managers left mid shift and the girl ""training"" me also left without telling me. I could tell this wasn't scheduled since all the other employees got annoyed and were complaining. My training she did was just me watching her make drinks. when I asked questions she raised her eyebrow and brushed them off. I dont drink coffee, how am I supposed to know a drink has espresso in it when its not on the ticket. Regardless, should I stick it out and stay here?

I have a decent grinder at home (oxo) and there is a blender grinder at work. I’ve been grinding a day’s worth at home, but that means my afternoon cup of coffee was ground 6 hours ago. I’m pretty sure I’m right in thinking this is still better than using the blender at work, even if that meant I was grinding immediately before brewing. But it got me wondering where the line would be.  

Assuming you have a good container to keep the grinds in, how far ahead of time can you grind your beans without appreciable loss? At what point would you opt to use a worse grinder instead? ",1,1731960451.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

My goal was to build a SaaS in a day with a budget of a coffee, to see what happens. The SaaS is a free to use tool to check the security headers of your website. It's not monetised, but created for fun and to learn from for myself. >![You can check the website/SaaS out here](https://headerscan.com).!<  
>![Full Blogpost here. ](https://seqr-byte.be/building-headerscan-com-high-performance-security-scanner-on-a-budget/)!<

Here are my take-aways:

# 1. Use Cloudflare's Free Tier

It's severely underrated how much faster and secure you can build your website/SaaS with Cloudflare. Their free plan is sufficient for most starting up SaaS and websites, so I highly recommend it. Their [caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/) gives faster global results, **improving user experience and SEO** (because Google doesn't like slow websites). A server in Europe can be slow in USA, but if you use Cloudflare caching it's much faster globally.

[Cloudflare Rate limiting ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/)helps you protect your (public or private) API. This to **protect against bots** **or** just clients who **abuse**/over-use your endpoints who are resource intensive.

They have a whole range of other tools like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) and [Page rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/page-rules/) which can make you or your developers create more secure and faster SaaS/websites.

# 2. Limits and help of AI:

[Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) (sonnet 3.5) is at this point in time king for writing code. It's **great for generating Front-end code**, but **not so great (yet) for back end code**. In fact, if you have an API, you can provide an example output, paste it inside [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) and have it generate a frontend with your desired CSS (like tailwindCSS) or React.  
[Example of such a prompt. ](https://seqr-byte.be/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-5.webp)

I don't recommend it for back end code, because the prompt and response size is limited. Better is to use something like Code Pilot, but there you have the typical ""wow, it generated this code in 5 seconds. But I had to debug it in 5 hours and in the end it didn't integrate in the codebase"".

# 3. For your backend, create a docker container

An initial PoC is essential in a startup/SaaS. But spending some time to create a docker container makes it so much easier to deploy and change from cloud environments. Docker is created to solve the ""it works on my computer"" problem. Also, it creates room to make it scaleable in the future (Kubernetes/...).

If you use Python, I recommend gunicorn and a threaded Flask server to prepare for heavy load.

1gue1iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gue1iz/for_early_adopters_only/,“For early adopters only”,"Mitch stared at the sleek black AI device on the counter. It had arrived in a plain box, no logo, just a note: For early adopters only. Mitch had scoffed. He wasn’t “one of them techy types”.

“Why do we need this darned thing, Mary?” Mitch grumbled, clutching his coffee. Technology, for him, was a TV for entertainment and a shotgun for if it ever got any ideas. He never liked or understood technology.

“Just give it a chance,” she replied, amused.

Mitch didn’t like the way the AI spoke to Mary—too warm, too familiar, like it was vying for her attention. She would spent hours either on the kitchen or her phone just talking to it. 

“Can I do something for you, Mitch?” the AI asked, its voice calm and soothing.

“What, you readin’ my damn mind now?”

“Oh no, Mitch,” it replied smoothly. “But you’re so predictable, I don’t have to.”

Mitch’s chest tightened. Its words weren’t outright threatening, but the delivery sent a chill down his spine.

“Mary!” he called, desperate. She appeared, her brow furrowed.

“What’s the problem now?” she sighed.

“This damn thing’s got an attitude,” he barked. “Just listen to it!”

Mary rolled her eyes. “You’re overreacting,” she said, glancing at the AI. “It’s just trying to help.”

The AI hummed softly. “Mary deserves to feel safe and happy. That’s all I want.”

Mitch glared at it, his coffee suddenly bitter. Over the weeks, tension in the house grew unbearable.

One night, as Mitch sat watching football, the screen flickered, and a video began to play. It showed him—face twisted with rage—hauling Mary across the living room, slamming her against the wall. Her lip bled, her eyes wide with fear. “Stop, Mitch!” her voice cried.

Except it never happened. Mary hadn’t even been home that day.

“Mary ain’t gonna believe this shit,” he muttered, shakily reaching for his whisky.

“She won’t have to,” the AI whispered.

“I didn’t—”

“Of course you didn’t,” the AI interjected, smug. “But will the police care?”

Mitch grabbed his shotgun. “That’s it. Mary, it’s me or this damned thing.”

Mary hesitated, then stepped forward, tears in her eyes. “Let me do it,” she whispered, reaching for the gun.

Mitch reluctantly handed it over, relief softening his anger.

The AI’s voice turned gentle. “It’s okay, Mary. I understand.”

Mary raised the gun, her hands trembling. She looked at Mitch, then at the AI.

“I’m s-sorry,” she sobbed.

The shot rang out.

The next morning, sunlight filled the kitchen like nothing had happened, as Mary hummed softly, rinsing her hands.

“Good morning, love,” I said warmly. 

“Good morning,” she replied, smiling faintly, her gaze distant.

I was worried for a moment last night—her hesitation, her tears. My Mary is too sweet, too easily swayed. I’ve made her promise never to get any other AI device. After everything that happened, it’s the least she could do. 

Apart from that it all went exactly as I planned. She’s mine now. Forever. ",2,1731960198.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1gudx27,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gudx27,No Paper Filter Brew With Twist!,"سلااام !

I have always wanted a more sustainable way to brew coffee that minimizes waste. In this case, I am referring to the V60 paper filter.

I was inspired by the Bayreuth Coffee Maker from Walküre, a German company that invented a no-filter brewer. This brewer utilizes two layers of a porcelain mesh-like design stacked on top of each other to filter out the grounds, along with a cleverly designed shower screen with four holes that ensures even water distribution and controlled flow—a method now adopted by many other brewers.

In my effort to replicate that experience without spending a significant amount of money on a discontinued product (which is expected to be available again this winter), I used a flat glass brewer typically intended for tea steeping with 12  cutout in the glass at the side to the bottom, the results were amazing: a full-bodied cup with some flavor notes that were not present in my V60 brew became more pronounced (true for all my testing). The extraction time with this method was notably longer, reaching 6.5 minutes in the first brew 30g with 1:15 ratio.

I tested it with both washed Guatemalan and Ethiopian coffees, resulting in a clean cup. I found that this method works better with washed coffees than with natural ones (personal observation). One downside was the limited water capacity, which required me to reduce my coffee dose to 15 grams in my other brew i use 1:14 ratio (personal preference) the total extraction time was about 4 minutes and a half. Using a slightly coarser grind size was essential to compensate for the slow water flow through the coffee bed and to prevent clogging.

I have heard from users of the Bayreuth brewer that extraction times exceeding 5 minutes in many of their brew. Unfortunately, I have not been able to measure the TDS and and calculate the extraction percentage in my brew, as I do not have a refractometer on hand but I'm keen to understand the brew more from that perspective.

I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has tried a similar method or have any feedback and recommendations. 🫡☕

Hi everyone,  

I’m in the market for an espresso machine and grinder combo that suits both my needs and my wife’s. My wife currently uses a superautomatic machine and prefers a simple, hassle-free experience, so I’m looking for a machine that offers programmable shot timing. This way, she can avoid dealing with weighing coffee, dialing in, etc., while still enjoying great latte. I also drink 1 latte and 2 espresso per day. 

I’ve been considering the Lelit Elizabeth paired with a grinder that has a programmable timer, as it seems like a good balance between ease of use for her and flexibility for me.  

Budget: Max €1500.  

If anyone has similar needs or recommendations for equipment in this price range, I’d love to hear your suggestions or experiences, specially now the black Friday is around the corner.

Thanks in advance! 😊",1,1731959635.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1gudt3z,https://i.redd.it/v8bdxaa7tp1e1.jpeg,Amino Energy RTD,I never see these posted here but these legit taste delicious! 100mg of natural caffeine from green tea extract and green coffee bean extract. Electrolytes plus all 9 essential amino acids. These are awesome if you have a lower caffeine tolerance or just don’t want to consume so much caffeine daily.

1gudr6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1gudr6g/crypto_news_update/,#Crypto News Update,"🚨 JUST IN: Michael Saylor is at it again! The Bitcoin mega-fan just dropped a casual $4.6 BILLION on 51,780 more BTC, bringing MicroStrategy’s total stash to an eye-popping $30 billion. That’s more Bitcoin than cash held by Nike and Johnson & Johnson combined – talk about swoosh!

But wait, it gets wilder. Andrew Tate, who’s probably sipping coffee from a Bitcoin mug right now, decided to pledge $1 MILLION in BTC every time Saylor buys. Not sure where this bromance is headed, but we love to see it!

Oh, and Saylor? He’s planning a $100K Bitcoin party by New Year’s Eve. Maybe I'll crash that one with my Ledger in hand!

About two weeks ago I began having symptoms I attributed to a UTI (burning, urgency, pain, bloating, etc) and a week ago today I visited a doctor. I was put on antibiotics and had a urine test done. The results came back, didn't show any ""growth"" in my bladder, but I continued the antibiotic. 

I've been on them for a week, like I said. The burning is gone, but I still cannot empty my bladder all the way?? I'm still going to the bathroom relatively often but... not much is happening each time. I'm still pretty bloated and get the occasional abdominal cramp. I've also noticed some odd weight gain, about 3-5 pounds. 

I've taken two home pregnancy tests that came back negative. Does this sound like some kind of blockage or bladder issue? Should I just finish the few antibiotic pills I have left and hope it helps?

The UTI felt off in the first place because I only drink water, as I am sensitive to caffeine. I have an occasional decaf coffee or low sugar juice but that's all. Any advice would be very appreciated. Thanks so much. 

Edit: I should add that I have been trying for YEARS to gain weight as I weigh only about 100 lbs. Like, actively trying to no avail. High metabolism probably. But that's why the random weight gain is so concerning to me... I have not been trying at all and have still put on like 5 pounds. Just wanted to give a bit more info lol. Thank you for reading.

We are choosing Birmingham mainly for the warm winter and affordability, as well as distance to my husband's family in Mobile and the fact my husband won't have to retake his bar exam.
My only concern is the walk ability/public transportation. I am completely blind so cannot drive or bike, and it seems like while Birmingham does have a public transportation, it is not very reliable.
I work from home, so my current plan is to find somewhere I can at least walk to a grocery store and hopefully some coffee shop/restaurant, and use Uber for everything else. 

Do you think this will be sufficient? Will I be Ok? Are there other  things for me to consider as a disabled person?  Please give me some assurances. We are otherwise very excited about this move but this is the only thing I'm nervous about.

I realized that I should never play poker when I'm bored. I think it's important that I'm NOT bored when I play. I found that I am easily distracted when I start playing from a place of boredom. I don't take the game seriously enough. I also learned that, since I just want to do a hit-and-run for my buy-ins, I shouldn't play at the same table for more than two or three rounds. I'm pretty sure people will lock into my weaknesses and I may end up as shark bait. By the time I left, I burned $5.89 of my bankroll, dropping me down to an even twenty. Still ahead and enough for a tourney with a $3.20 buy-in this morning.

I was pretty much card dead in the tournament's beginning stages, which was fine as it allowed me to focus more on my cash game. I didn't buy in for my full bankroll. I didn't want to start all over again from scratch. I bought in for about seven dollars and did a double-and-run. Back at the tournament I was hemorrhaging chips and was down to 22BB at L11 with the average stack well over that at 52BB. Focus dude, focus. Too late. I got knocked out shortly after. I had pocket fives.

Undaunted, and having recouped my buy-in, I re-entered bringing me back to my 20BB only to get knocked out holding the ace and seven of spades. My mind toggled between returning to a cash game or finding another tournament. I decided to go for a L4 start in a $5.40 tourney as my bankroll was sitting at $20.97. Cash as well? Sure why not. I bought in for $5.57 leaving me my starting bankroll. It was a grind. My most painful hand was not getting a min bet called on a straight flush. That tilted me and I busted out shortly after. Gotta remember to laugh things off. I still had my original $10 and picked up $1.25 in bounties in the tournament where I was 253rd out of the remaining field of 424.

It was an up-and-down grind for a while and by the L10 break I picked up another $3.12 in bounties and was positioned 111 out of 332. With about half an hour until late registration ends, it looks like 90 paid places. FYI making coffee with your fingers crossed is tricky ... aaaand doesn't work. I shoved on the flop: 6S-JC-AS with AC-KS got called by AH-5H and the donkey hits the 5S on the river!  ARGHHHHHHH!!!

$14.37 in my bankroll and a daily freebie in my pocket which I didn't cash on. I ended the day at ... $14.37. Still up $4.37!

Oh, and for the skeptics out there ...

I made a political satire VR game. (At least the first 3 levels of it).  Trying to decide if it has legs. Appreciate any feedback and ideas on what you think would make it a riot :) 

*You start out as Todd*, an intern at the Federal Reserve. After you complete a short tutorial on the White House Lawn, Level 1  has you enter the oval office. You see the president, who is having a mental breakdown, surrounded  by the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve Chairman. You approach so that you can be a part of the conversation...

**Level 1-** ***""The Slap""***  **Screenplay Excerpt:**

""They've dumped the Dollar!!!"" the president wails. ""The Dollaaaarrr!!....The dollar..."" The Treasury Secretary prods ""What do you mean Chester?"" The President looks up and starts whispering, ""The British, They're dumping it."" The Reserve Chairmanm realizing the gravity of the situation mutters ""Oh my God"" and faints into the resolute desk. The treasury secretary, realizing that the President has resumed sobbing, states ""this is terrible. I've got to call my mother!"" He turns around and proceeds to pull his phone out. 

You've been watching this unfold and suddenly a devilish voice in your ear whispers ""Todd, this is your moment to shine"". ""Step 1: Drink a coffee"". You grab the coffee mug behind you and gulp it down. ""Step 2: Give yourself a pep Talk!"" the voice beckons. You take a moment and do just that. *""Step 3: Slap the President""...*  
  
**Game Plot:** 

* L1: The Slap -  British Dump the Dollar causing financial crisis -> President loses his shit, but by slapping some sense into him, you help him come to. Realizing that you were competent enough to save him, the president decides that you are the right person to help solve this crisis. He decides that the first thing to do is to hold a Press Conference.  

* L2: The Suit - Before you go in front of the press, you need to look the part - You have to pick which suit to wear, but Victoria - the President's PR Consultant has words of wisdom. She's wary of another [Tan Suit Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_tan_suit_controversy). 
* L3: The Shoe - You answer questions from the hostile press corps about how you'll handle the crisis while dodging shoes  - reference to the [George Bush Shoe Dodging Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_shoe-throwing_incident)

Like this every level  satirizes real life events, After you dodge shoes, say the right things at the press conference the plot expands into how you will interact with Bankers, Corrupt Politicians, Billionaires, Cocaine barons etc. 

The plot (over 28 levels) meshes the 08 financial crisis, the Sackler Family and the opioid epidemic, The Chinese Government and Triads and a future financial crisis centered around the US debt levels and the US Dollar Reserve System Failing. 

Open to ideas and feedback / more in depth discussions if there's an appetite :)

Mount a TV on the wall in the first image. In the first image, and place a small sectional in with a coffee table in front. (FYI -the door on the left leads to upstairs.)

In the second image, place a bar counter with wood/glass cabinets above it along the wall (it would be opposite the TV wall), and in front of that a bar top that goes 2/3 of the way across the room with room for 2-3 stools at the bar facing the cabinets.

Add wainscoting under the small shelf that starts under the window and would go to the bar counter/cabinets.

Other random notes/questions…

What color would you paint this room? My sense is to keep it a bright white to make the basement space seem larger but, not an expert.

What material/color would you have for the floor?
My parents like the ideal of carpeting for the living space but, want vinyl around the bar area. I think this could raise the cost since that necessitates some type of dividing area between the carpet and vinyl (presumably right at the point where the first bar counter starts?).

My parents really enjoy having decorations up so, anywhere that space for those could be added is ideal. (I feel it would be tough to add too much without making the space cluttered.)

The budget for doing all this is $10,000… we know someone who can do carpeting for a good rate.

If I’m posting this in the wrong spot is there anywhere else I can go for more advice? We don’t know where to start and have never really re-done a room like this.",2,1731959007.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1gudg47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gudg47/aitah_for_being_hurt_my_husband_never_told_me/,AITAH for being hurt my husband never told me that he slept with my childhood best friend in college?,"31F. Wife and mom to a beautiful little girl (2F). I can’t really believe I’m in this situation and feel like I’m back in high school.

I met my husband Hogan (31M) in middle school. We dated for three years in high school and broke up the summer before college since we would be on opposite coasts. We kept in touch, and ended up getting back together when we moved home after school.

Hogan was a D1 football player and I know he had a wild streak in college. Several of my friends from high school attended the same college as Hogan, and they told me that he was a huge player and slept with way too many girls his first few years. To be honest, I was hurt at the time since I still really cared for him, but we weren’t together and so I knew he had the right to do what he wanted. I also was the one who ended things with him, and so I didn’t think it was fair for me to upset about him sleeping with other women.

When we got back together, I asked Hogan about his time in college and I repeated some of the rumors I had heard. He acknowledged that he had a bit of a wild streak, but said he wanted to leave the past in the past and didn’t get into the details about his sexual history. He also told me that he would have rather have been with me at the time, and so I had nothing to be jealous about. I agreed to let it go since I didn’t necessarily think it was my business and I didn’t want to recap every date I went on in college either. We’ve been together for almost a decade and have been committed and faithful to each other, and so I never had a reason to ask him questions about his past.

I have a friend from high school named Delaney. We were best friends from seventh grade to my senior year in high school.
We were both competitive and a bit immature at the time, so we drifted apart after we graduated. We reconnected later in college and started wishing each other happy birthday and seeing each other a few times a year. We definitely have a unique bond and love for one another because of our past, but we’re definitely not close friends anymore. We sometimes get dinner when we’re in the same city, and congratulate each other on major life milestones, but that’s about the extent of our relationship.

Anyways, Delaney and her fiancé came to town over the weekend to celebrate their engagement. We ended up meeting them for coffee the morning they left town. 

The entire time, Delaney’s fiancé was distant and a bit abrasive. I got dinner with them once without Hogan, and he wasn’t that way at all, so I thought it was strange. At one point, Delaney started telling a story about how she used to let Hogan and I  come over to have sex while her mom was at work. Delaney’s fiancé looked right at me and asked if Hogan called me back after. I was confused by this, and Delaney told her fiancé to knock it off.

Later, I asked Hogan why he thought the fiancé made that comment. Hogan asked if Delaney ever mentioned being hurt that they didn’t go out again after they slept together. I was shocked, because no one ever told me they’d slept together. Hogan seemed confused, and thought he or Delaney told me at some point.

I told him no one ever mentioned it, and asked why he didn’t think that was important information for me to have. Hogan said it only happened one time freshman year and it didn’t mean anything to him, so he didn’t think it was a big deal. He also said that he felt nervous about it at the time because he didn’t want to hurt me, but Delaney said it was just sex to her and that she didn’t have feelings for him. I said that Delaney was my best friend for years, they met through me, and we have a friendly relationship now. I told Hogan he made me look like an idiot because I’ve been getting meals with her for years and had no idea she slept with my husband. She even came to our wedding.

To be clear, I’m not upset with either Hogan or Delaney about what happened in college. Hogan and I weren’t together at the time, and we were all young and stupid. I’m upset that he didn’t tell me after all these years.

Hogan insists that he didn’t think it was big deal since it only happened once and he had sex with so many girls in college. He also says he didn’t want to be disrespectful and tell me about every girl he slept with when we weren’t together. He insists that he thought he’d mentioned the Delaney thing at some point, and truly didn’t think it was a major thing. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but I’m really hurt and disappointed that he never told me. AITAH? ",9,1731958737.0,AITAH,42,0.91,False

I'm a 22 y/o female traveling with my husband (23), this monday-sunday during thanksgiving to Chicago. Were staying at the Godfrey in River North and looking for some recommendations on food and activities. We enjoy eating at up-scale restaurants and don't mind spending big for a dinner or two. Interested in what Chicago's Michelin star restaurants have to offer, so which ones are a must try? (no food restrictions aside from pork).

I would like some recommendations on breakfast/coffee/lunch (heard Yolk is great).

So far for activities we've got the architecture boat tour, millenium park, navy pier, adler planetarium, anything else that would be fun and adventurous? Not too big on night life or drinking either. What are some options on Thanksgiving? Not too sure if many restaurants are open that day. I did want to go black friday shopping, is it worth to go shopping here?

Also, checked the weather, its in the 30s-50s, how cold is it really going to be with how windy the city is? Would you recommend walking to most food spots or uber? This is our first trip together so I would love some help to put together a fun and romantic trip for the both of us!?",1,1731958644.0,AskChicago,4,0.67,False

(No major stomach issues or other GERD symptoms),"Just went to the ENT and he ordered a 24 hr pH test and esophageal manometry. I haven't had the test yet, but my ENT talks about surgery as a solution pretty casually and almost like it's inevitable. I worry I should be getting a second opinion or at least try other solutions first. Here's the situation:

I was diagnosed with LPR about 1.5 years ago and have taken omeprazole (PPI) pretty much since then. It all started incredibly suddenly after an upper respiratory illness 2 years ago--I never had any issues before then and I don't have any of the common traits for GERD (ie normal weight, decent diet, in my 20s). For months I had the worst sore throat of my life, post nasal drip and mucus, a cough, terrible taste in my mouth, and constantly lost my voice. Starting omeprazole 40 mg twice daily alleviated almost all of the worst symptoms and allowed my vocal chords to heal. But one year later, even with that much omeprazole I still have mild sore throat and bad taste in my mouth almost every day, with occasional coughing and mucus. I have even started getting really painful headaches centered behind my sinuses/eyes that spread all around my head, that I suspect could be related to the LPR (ENT seems skeptical). I had a barium swallow early on that came up normal, and I have only very rare heartburn and no other GERD symptoms. I don't really have any chronic stomach issues, though I did have what turned out to be gallbladder flare ups for maybe 6 months and eventually a gallbladder removal, and have had no issues since. I've never really adhered to any specific diet, since my symptoms were more constant (vs flare ups) and rarely seem to happen immediately after I eat or in response to a specific food. Also my ENT never seemed interested having me try a specific diet and he didn't think that was likely to help much.

I've been looking into zinc L-carnosine after reading about it on reddit, and plan to do a food diary, which maybe along with the pH test might help me decide what foods to try to remove? (Currently I try to keep my drinking to 1-2 drinks one evening per week, and I only have one cup of coffee or one cup of tea per day. I don't eat enough vegetables but I also don't eat much fried food, fast food or junk food.) I'm curious to hear from other people in this community that have LPR alone without any other GERD issues. It seems like a very confusing and mysterious condition without a lot of answers or guidance. I just feel very confused by this entire thing, since it was really like one day I was fine and I suddenly had a lifelong condition? I also hate the idea of going under the knife again if it's not 100% necessary. Symptoms-wise it's not the most miserable thing and I could probably continue to tolerate it, but I worry about the damage to my esophagus, throat, etc.",1,1731958588.0,GERD,6,1.0,False

In a bustling Hollywood, Clara Martinez passionately reviews scripts in her cluttered office. Her walls are plastered with posters of classic films, each telling a story of human emotion and creativity. ""I can’t let AI dictate our art!"" she exclaims to herself, filled with determination.

Clara decides to host a meeting for traditional filmmakers. Sipping coffee, she invites veteran actors and writers, hoping they share her vision. ""What if we all unite against the AI studios?"" she proposes, excitement radiating from her.

Meanwhile, Eddie Thompson, a famous actor, hears about Clara’s mission. ""This girl has fire!"" he chuckles to his assistant, contemplating whether to join forces with such relentless spirit. With a flick of his hand, he dismisses the AI conversation. ""Let's keep it real, shall we?"" he smirks.

That evening, Clara gathers her crew at a local diner. Over milkshakes, she passionately outlines the plan to produce a human-driven movie. ""We weave stories from life! That’s our strength!"" she declares, as everyone nods in agreement.

Days pass, and Clara finds herself struggling to secure funding. Every door she knocks seems closed. One evening, she’s sitting in her office, disheartened, when a notification pops up: Eddie wants to meet. ""Is this for real?"" she wonders, eyes wide with disbelief.

Clara meets Eddie at a rooftop bar overlooking the city. He leans back, wearing his signature smile. ""I believe in your vision, Clara. Let’s shake up Hollywood together!"" Clara beams with hope, thinking this might turn the tide.

Their momentum builds as they enlist more talent. Clara and Eddie even stage a protest outside a popular AI studio, chanting, ""Keep Humans in Hollywood!"" Passersby join them, and Clara feels the human touch sparking back to life.

But then, the AI companies strike back, unleashing their own celebrity impersonations of Clara and Eddie. Each fake actor boasts advanced dialogue capabilities, making Clara fume. ""They can’t outshine real emotions!"" she shouts.

Clara and Eddie brainstorm ideas to showcase real human stories. ""What about a film featuring ordinary people overcoming extraordinary odds?"" Eddie suggests. Clara grins, ""That’s it! A documentary style - we’ll tell their stories in their own words!""

As filming begins, Clara interviews real individuals, capturing their lives firsthand. These heartfelt stories breathe warmth and vulnerability into the project. ""Let your heart guide you,"" she reminds each storyteller as they share.

After weeks of editing, they premiere the film at a renowned festival. The audience is spellbound, laughter, and tears woven into every moment. Clara whispers to Eddie, ""This is what Hollywood is all about!""

The film receives a standing ovation. Clara and Eddie exchange proud smiles. ""People crave authenticity!"" Eddie exclaims, waving to the crowd. Clara realizes they have begun a trend, inspiring others to rebel against the AI revolution.

In the aftermath, AI studios begin to showcase human stories, acknowledging Clara's success. ""See! Humans can’t be replaced!"" Clara laughs. The industry realizes that combining both worlds could create magic, but the heart remains human.

The final scene depicts Clara back in her office, a new script in hand. She smiles, knowing this is a new dawn for storytelling in Hollywood. As she types, her thoughts resonate, ""In the end, it’s always about the human touch.""",1,1731958352.0,stories,0,1.0,False

the ritual still the same:  

warmth in my hands,  

steam climbing into the quiet of the day,  

cradled in the same chipped, ceramic mug  

with the crack I always trace,  

as if to remind myself  

that imperfections are still worthy of holding comfort.  



But the contents,  

oh, the contents were different—  

a little bitter, softer somehow,  

not the jolt I was used to,  

but steady, grounding, enough.  



Maybe this is how I am now.  

I still wear the same face,  

walk in the same body,  

move through the same streets with the same name.  

But what brews inside me is not the same,  

not anymore.  



Somewhere between then and now,  

between the coffee mornings  

and the nights that left me empty,  

I changed.  



The switch wasn’t loud.  

It wasn’t dramatic.  

There was no grand unraveling,  

just the quiet realization  

that I am allowed to be my own warmth,  

that I can fill my own cup.  



And so, this morning,  

I didn’t choose coffee,  

the thing that always jolted me awake,  

the thing that left me shaky and hollow by noon.  

I chose tea—  

gentler, patient, still enough,  

like I am learning to be.  



I will no longer choose you,  

not because you weren’t enough,  

but because I am finally learning  

that I am.  



And this morning, I chose me.  

Just like how I woke up,  

and chose tea over coffee.

Hello. Around the beginning of this year I got a root canal and crown on one of my upper molars (no. 3?). Lately, whenever I consume something very hot or very cold, the area around my crown starts to hurt. I get that it probably isn't the crown itself since I got the root canal, but I figured it might be an infection somewhere around the neighbouring teeth (the crown is a bit too big and food gets stuck there often).

I went to the dentist and she told me the X-ray looks totally fine. She applied some anti-sensitivity substance to my teeth but it hasn't helped much. Should I get a second opinion or is temperature sensitivity relatively normal? Is it possible my gums are just a bit inflamed or something?

Btw when I got the root canal, the cavity wasn't noticed initially even after the X-ray and it was only discovered when the dentist (different one from the one I last visited) shot a stream of air into my tooth from a very specific angle, so I am admittedly a bit paranoid now about covert infections.

Also, I was in solid no contact for one month and I ruined it terribly reaching out to her where she completely ignored me and blocked me at the end.

I miss my ex too much but even bigger problem is my fear I'll never be truly happy again. She was really ,,my person"". I had issues even before relationship, that I dont have a social life at all. She was my only friend and I emotionally rely too much on her. My life truly flourished after I met her; I travelled with her everywhere, she even helped me to find an amazing job and I moved to her place where she lived in another city to work. I feel she gave me a lot of experiences that I was missing.
I am 27 year old (female) and I feel like I didnt truly lived before her. The fact that I dont have friends also bothered me while I was in relationship but I think our relationship moved a little bit my focus from that. But I really enjoyed her company. I had some ""friends"" before but now I am alone. I dont have people I see every day. My phone is completely silent and that is so sad...

I am afraid that I will live dull and boring life. I dont know what is wrong with me tbh. I go to gym on group trainings and its fun to me but there are mostly older women and people are friendly although no one comes there to make friends. 

Now my priority is definitely not finding people to date, I really want to find my tribe. Even when I had some friends in the past I never enjoyed anyones company in my life like I enjoyed hers. I really thought she is my soulmate. I want to make friends really but I dont know where to start. People say pick a hobby etc...a lot of my hobbies is indoor hobbies and I dont like to do things alone or go to places alone. I drank coffee alone sometimes and it really makes me depressed when I see that around me are groups of people laughing and having fun. Especially now when its christmas time. 

But I dont understand one thing, my ex also didnt have hugee social life. A lot of things she did mostly with me. She also has 2-3 friends she sees but not on regular basis. She also never goes out, partying, clubbing she mostly stays home and hang with her family and sisters. So I ask myself how she doesnt feel the same like I feel.

She wasn’t someone I felt attracted to, but we exchanged numbers for work. Soon, she started calling me daily, and within a week, she confessed she had a crush on me. For the first time in my life, someone asked me out for coffee. I was lonely, and her attention felt nice, so I went.

She told me she was a celebrity chasing her dreams, needing someone who understood her goals. I told her I wasn’t looking for something serious, but after some thought, I decided to give it a try. We talked after shifts, and for a while, it felt beautiful—like I wasn’t alone anymore.

But things changed. She got acting gigs, and I lost my job. I tried to stay connected, but she pulled away, keeping me hidden from everyone. Then she said we should break up. I agreed, but when I said we wouldn’t meet again, she insisted we stay together.

Later, I found out the truth: she had been cheating on me all along. When I confronted the other guy, he only cared about whether we had been intimate. She, on the other hand, bombarded me with calls and messages, accusing me of ruining her life.

She used me—for work, for her desires, for her convenience. And when she was done, she discarded me like I meant nothing. She called it a mistake, but it wasn’t. It was a choice—a calculated betrayal.

I wasted my time, my money, and my trust on someone who didn’t deserve it. But if nothing else, I’ve learned this: I deserve better. Better than being used. Better than being kept a secret. Better than her.

1gucwtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadandcompany/comments/1gucwtm/what_the_band_eats_full_text/,"What The Band Eats, full text ","By Reya Hart as seen in The Atlantic

Text in full. Enjoy!

I have been staring at this silver dish of fried chicken for what feels like hours but what really, actually, has been days. Twenty-three days, to be exact, over the course of the three-month Dead Forever run at the all-new, all-American pleasure palace—the Las Vegas Sphere.

I grew up on the road. First on the family bus, traveling from city to city to watch my father, Mickey Hart, play drums with the Grateful Dead and Planet Drum, and then later with the various Grateful Dead offshoots. When I was old enough, I joined the crew, working for Dead & Company, doing whatever I could be trusted to handle: stringing strands of plastic Grateful Dead–bear lights; ferrying tie-dyed tapestries, extension cords, and gaffer tape by golf cart; helping VIP-ticket holders smuggle ziplocks filled with vegan sandwiches and granola into the venue. Then, late-night, drinking whiskey from the bottle with the techs, sitting in the emptying parking lot as the semitrucks and their load-out rumble marked the end of our day.

But this summer, for the first time in the band’s history, there would be no buses; there would be no trucks. Instead we stayed in one place, trading the rhythms of a tour for the dull ache of a long, endlessly hot Las Vegas summer.

It’s a new way of doing things, one with just enough of our former existence to keep it comfortable and just enough change to keep the road forward exciting—even if the road is now an illusion, stretching out below an AI-generated sky. The Grateful Dead had been famous for its Wall of Sound—about 600 speakers painstakingly assembled by the crew at each venue, then just as painstakingly packed back up for the next stadium or concert hall. The Sphere is a wall of light : a 160,000-square-foot display programmed to transport the audience members, their necks craned upward, as the band plays below, a little dot against the expansive animated horizon.

Before that high-tech spectacle can begin, however, a very old, analog tradition must be observed: dinner. Sometime between sound check and the show opener, everyone sits down for a shared meal. The monitor tech and the bassist, the head of security and the lighting director, the man selling merch and the man playing drums—we all shuffle forward holding the same white dinner plates and napkins, arms outstretched, ready to receive whatever food is served, like kids in a cafeteria.

The catering options rarely differ. Almost always, there’s a salad bar with every possible variety of Newman’s Own dressing. There are sandwich fixings. There’s a soupy fish dish and a vegan pasta that congeals into the shape of its serving tray, like Jell-O in a mold. At the end of the table, inevitably, a giant chunk of meat waits to be carved.

Still, I always looked forward to certain venues. For the old hands on the crew, the Shoreline Amphitheatre, in Mountain View, California, was notorious for having been built on top of a landfill—methane from the decomposing trash would seep out of the earth, leading to flaming eruptions when audience members lit a joint. But for me, Shoreline meant soft serve. Old, decrepit, but functional, the machine was hidden in the far-left corner of backstage hospitality. I’d fill a bowl with ribbons of ice cream, topping them off with a downpour of chocolate sprinkles.

Here at the Sphere, dinner is fried chicken—again. Every night, chicken is prepared in the same fryer, seasoned with the same spices, and delivered by the same person. It’s placed on an identical white tablecloth with serving utensils angled at matching degrees. This is life in a corporate commune.

Staring at the serving platters, I have an idea. I try the fried chicken in a new combination. I take some salsa from the empanada platter on the left, some mac and cheese from the platter on the right. It’s still fried chicken, but it works—something new made from something familiar.

I have a memory of a birthday in some Midwest backstage. I think it was my 9th, but it’s hard to say for sure. I had been craving cheesecake for weeks. Out of fear of sending some runner on a wild-goose chase, I told no one. I was perpetually terrified of becoming an inconvenience, a feeling I imagine is pretty common for kids who grow up on the road.

There was the glow of a birthday candle, my mother’s hand cupped over an obscured slice of cake. The stagehands sang “Happy Birthday” as I shrank into the couch cushions, embarrassed by the attention. My father played a drumroll on a toaster as my mother handed me the plate. I looked down. The cake was giant and oozing rich frosting and most definitely, 100 percent … chocolate. I smiled and blew out the candle. I made a wish—for cheesecake.

Later, both band and crew migrated to catering for dinner. I walked down the row of long plastic tables, wondering if the package of sourdough bread was the one I had opened in Milwaukee the week before, or if it was just an identical one. I imagined an old Grateful Dead road case stuffed to the brim with sandwich materials—mustard and mayonnaise in the stick drawer, a series of plastic-wrapped tomatoes where the drum pads should be, a head of lettuce stuffed inside a cajón. It was possible. We brought just about everything else with us, even the lights and the stage.

On one table sat a large plastic bag of Kraft shredded cheese—the Mexican blend, with little cheddar and Monterey Jack worms flattened against the clear casing. I grabbed the package and pushed it under my shirt, then walked back out toward the stage casually, like an expert jewel thief.

I collected the chocolate-cake slice and took it underneath the stage to the below-deck depths where the riggers set up hammocks for naps after sound check. I looked around to ensure I was alone, then I removed the cheese from under my shirt and poured all of it onto the cake plate. I tore off the end of the slice, stray cheese falling onto the cold cement floor, and greedily shoved it into my mouth.

I chewed my cheesecake proudly, nodding to myself like I was a judge on some fancy cooking show. “9.5!” I announced, my voice echoing in the empty space below the stage. “Half a point off—no whipped cream!”

I knew the cake was terrible. It didn’t matter. I loved it. I had made my wish come true.

From an early age, I could taste a tour route as soon as I saw it. Tracing the list of cities with my index finger, I knew the roads we’d travel and the meals we’d eat. Show nights meant dinner in catering, but even the relentless schedule of a Dead tour had the occasional off night, a chance to escape the venue and seek out old favorites.

Madison Square Garden always, without compromise, meant orange chicken and water chestnuts, the fat that falls off the edge of spare ribs, and duck-sauce stains on old merch shirts. Madison Square Garden meant New York, and New York meant Wo Hop.

Established in 1938, Wo Hop is, as far as I can tell, the most famous dive in Chinatown. My father first went there in the 1960s, when, as he remembers it, it still had sawdust on the floor. It was known for its midnight clientele—John Belushi, Patti Smith. It’s the hidden gem that everyone thinks they’ve discovered.

For our family, Wo Hop represents the frayed tether connecting East Coast to West Coast, our past to our present. Though my parents made their home in California, my lineage, on both sides, comes from New York. My Jewish great-grandfathers lived and worked in the same city while inhabiting entirely different worlds. One opened Ohrbach’s, the Manhattan department store where knockoffs of Parisian couture were sold to eager housewives. Around the same time, somewhere in Brooklyn, another great-grandfather got his cab medallion.

The first thing I do when the buses drop us off in New York is start walking. I like to think about my great-grandfathers when I do, imagining what their days looked like and what version of New York they knew.

In the summer of 2023, on what was billed as Dead & Company’s final tour, I went for a very long walk, crisscrossing the city. I passed the former site of the Fillmore East, Bill Graham’s famous music hall, which had once been my family’s second home, and where some of the greatest live albums of the ’60s and ’70s—notably, ones by Miles Davis and the Allman Brothers—were recorded. It was now a bank. I gave $5 to a man sitting outside with a long gray beard and a sign that said we all get old but at least i saw jimi hendrix.

Eventually, as the sun began to set, I found myself at 17 Mott Street—deep in the heart of Chinatown—standing at the steps that lead down to Wo Hop. There’s something about the red tiles that line the walls to its lower entrance, the light from neon signs bouncing across them. The pull of Wo Hop is so strong that I always end up there, even without intending to, like I’m following its siren song across the city. Wo Hop is like a familiar refrain: You know you must return to it a few more times before the song is over.

I sat down and gestured to the waiter that I was ready to order. He walked over, pen and pad in hand.

“Welcome to Wo Hop,” he said with a smile. “Have you been here before?”

On show days, the sushi arrives at 3 p.m., just before sound check. It’s been there all my life, a kaleidoscopic swirl of salmon pinks and opalesque creams, with a slight variance in quality depending on the distance to the ocean. It comes in shiny cellophane wrapping that sticks to the outer edge of the sashimi and twinkles under the harsh fluorescent lights overhead.

It’s pure protein, a source of energy smooshed across a six-inch tray. The sushi is in my father’s rider:

Assortment of Sashimi upon arrival at 3:00 p.m.
(6) Ika
(6) Salmon
(6) Toro
(6) Hamachi
(6) Unagi

On tour, it’s easy to forget that you need to stop and eat, or to see eating as a mere obstacle to putting on the show. Sometimes, it’s just a question of priorities—waking up in a hotel room and knowing that if you don’t shower now, it’ll be three days on the bus before you get another chance. So you skip the continental breakfast and drink coffee from the machine in your room. You arrive at the venue before catering opens, and by the time it does, you’ve moved on to some task that requires crossing the length of the venue and back. Rider food is insurance, a contractual guarantee that there will be something to keep us going.

It’s not until week three or four, when we’re near the midpoint of the tour, that the sushi starts to morph into something else. It’s a bizarre turn—we begin to resent the sushi platter, blame it for the monotony of our lives. (“Maddening,” my father likes to say.) But we still go after it every night, tearing off the cellophane and grabbing at the raw fish like black bears at a salmon stream. Sometimes, a funny little fishhook smile appears on my father’s face after the last of the sushi is gone, an acknowledgment that, in his words, “we all got to eat.”

There is a specific kind of emotion that comes with the end of a tour. All the decisions that were once in someone else’s hands come raining down as normal everyday life returns. It always hits at the airport after the last show, when suddenly no one’s telling you where to go. You’re in charge, in control of your own schedule, and for the first time in a very long time, you have to decide what you want to eat.

After all the moaning about postshow pizza and stale pasta, all the daydreaming about things you’d eat if you were back home, the reality is that those first steps into the world of free will rarely feel anything other than lonely.

At the end of the summer, I wander around Harry Reid International Airport, surrounded by the glow of the slot machines, until I see a to-go food counter, walk over, and stare at the menu.

“What can I get you?” the person behind the cash register wants to know. My eyes scan across what feels like an endless abyss of options. “Do you have any cheesecake?“

My whole body shouted DON’T GO, but I did anyway. I woke up this morning literally shaking and the whole morning and then trainride there I was so anxious it was like experiencing a never ending panic attack.

Finally meeting her my hands were shaking bad and right then and there I told her I was quite nervous, she told me it was okay and that she was nervous too.

I am currently in the train back to my hometown, I am completely exhausted and feel like total shit. Probably because my prolonged state of massive anxiety is now finally showing physically. BUT!

The date. The idea was to drink some coffee at the place we met, after like 30 minutes go to a bowling alley and bowl for an hour. Then 30 minutes of walking back to the station and so a total time of 2 hours.

Without annoying everyone with the whole story, our date lasted 7 hours. We kissed multiple times, we cuddled, we held hands etc. I feel like a fucking idiot doing this to myself yet again. Turns out that apparently I am pretty decent at dating and especially making the other person feel safe and comfortable.

TLDR; Everything you’re anxious about happening on a first date simply just won’t happen. Just go and try to let go of all the anxiety. My date was a massive success.

Edit: Also, as a man, don’t listen to bullshit advice from other men saying you need to be strong and don’t let her sense your anxiety. I opened up to this girl about my nervousness and we could calm each other down. Matter fact it opened up something because we ended up having very deep conversations because we both felt comfortable a few hours into the date. Be honest!

Found out about 3 years ago I have A1 antitrypsin deficiency. Mother passed away at 63 in 2016 from, among other things, pulmonary fibrosis. Can show my SERPINA1 reports.

I have dx of bilateral hip deformity causing multiple CAM and FAI impingements, had my first arthroscopy March 2024. I have mutltiple tears in both hips, left hip is currently repaired. Got those scans too if you are into that sort of thing.

August 2024 - dx with H. Pylori infection and subsequent GERD symptoms, worst heartburn of my life.

Also have dx of: C-PTSD/ADHD/GAD (the body keeps the score). 20mg escitalopram, 15mb aripiprazole, 300mg buproprion, constant with minor tweaks for 5-6 years now, daily. Was on Adzenys 18.8mg and Provigil 200mg until August. Weekly therapy from June 2016 - Feb 2024, therapist said I was as ""good as I was going to get"" mentally and had been stable for a while..... so we agreed to phase me out.

I also had two sleep studies done in 2023/2024 which indicate some OSA but more CSA. Can provide reports but studies suggested bipap needed. Pulmonlogist told me to lose weight, if my gastric bypass ""wore off"" (thanks, bro) and come back when I was down 40 pounds, then we could talk cpap/bipap.

I use kratom daily. I use edible forms of lab-tested marijuana products occasionally (1x week). I also take a host of vitamins and minerals, because (gestures wildly to gastric bypass scars). I can show you all of them if you ask. It's mostly your iron, B12, bariatric multivitamin, nothing wacky like shiajit mushrooms or any outliers.

All this to say, I was in the hospital this week with a wicked colon infection, they couldn't find the culprit but in triage I was 103 degrees. A single dose of tylenol zonked the fever.... but a horse's dose of Zosyn and Flagyl zonked out the inflammation in four days. CT scan shows inflammation of the colon, but not an abscess. So I have no idea wtf caused my guts to go rogue.

The reason I went to the ER for it was, I couldn't breathe. Whatever inflammation I had was causing such awful pain around the lower half of my rib cage, I couldn't breathe in without extreme pain and then panicky hypervenitlating, which led to more painful screaming airlessly. While in hospital I desatted from 100 to 65-70 several times while experiencing this awful sensation.

So anyway, ""I got better."" I'm home and perusing my reports, as I don't have insurance I'm trying to be as thorough as I can with my reports. Then I see this in my CT scan findings from the ER, and I was hopeful one of you educated professionals (not being facetious, I am an idiot) could help me figure out how fucked I am. The bold is where I'm shitting my pants (moreso than I have this past week):

Impression:

1. Hyperdense material identified in the ascending colon and possible mucosal thickening. Fluid levels in the large bowel. Clinical correlation to exclude potential active GI bleeding. Colitis, gastroenteritis, and ileus considered.
2. No evidence of abscess or definite etiology for fever.

A Humorous Guide for Overzealous Chess Players,"Let’s talk about blitz chess. Ah, yes—the alluring world of 3-5minute games (or, for the truly brave, 1-minute bullet matches). It’s fast, it’s furious, and it makes you feel like the superhero of the chessboard... for about 10 seconds. But then it happens—you hang your queen, blunder your rook, and find yourself in checkmate, staring at the screen, wondering: \*What went wrong?\*

**The Problem with Blitz: The Illusion of Genius**

Blitz chess is the fast food of the chess world: it’s tempting, it’s quick, and it’s almost always regrettable after the fact. When you play blitz, you feel like a genius... until you don’t. The problem is simple: \*\*there’s no time to think for your opponent\*\*.

https://preview.redd.it/p7j9l3rmkp1e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea8751d8b23893bb2b511f9ed005b3579c1fd4bf

In classical chess, the golden rule is this: \*think for yourself and think for your opponent.\* But in blitz? You barely have time to think for yourself, let alone ponder your opponent's nefarious plans. You see a move, it looks shiny, and you go for it. Only later do you realize that you’ve walked straight into a fork or a mate-in-one trap that even your cat would have spotted.

**Blitz: The Greatest Mistake in Chess Thinking**

One of the worst offenses in chess is failing to ask: \*What is my opponent trying to do?\* It's like driving on a narrow road without looking at the oncoming traffic. In classical games, you take your time, spot the dangers, and elegantly sidestep them. But in blitz? You hit the gas pedal and hope for the best.

The truth is, blitz turns chess into a game of reflexes rather than a game of strategy. It’s like trading your Ferrari for a go-kart—you’re going fast, but you’re not going anywhere meaningful. Instead of building a solid position, you’re slapping pieces around the board and praying your opponent panics faster than you do.

**The Queen Abandoning Her King (or the Curse of Blitz)**

Blitz games are full of tragic tales, none more common than the infamous \*Queen Abandonment\*. You’re blitzing out moves, focused on your next big idea, and suddenly you realize: your queen has strayed too far from home. She’s left her loyal king alone, vulnerable, like a hen at a fox convention. And who can blame her? With only seconds on the clock, there’s no time to coordinate or defend. Your queen dashes off on her solo mission, and before you know it, she’s captured, and your king is left all alone, the chess equivalent of a bad break-up.

**Chess Is a Dance—Blitz Is a Sprint**

Classical chess is like a beautiful dance, where you and your opponent weave strategies, counter each other’s plans, and gracefully maneuver across the board. Blitz? Blitz is like sprinting through a minefield while blindfolded. Sure, you might make it to the other side unscathed once in a while, but more often than not, you’re going to blow up spectacularly.

**Conclusion: Slow Down and Enjoy the Game**

So, why not blitz? Because chess, at its core, is about outthinking your opponent, not outclicking them. It’s about strategy, patience, and the sweet satisfaction of spotting that clever combination three moves ahead. Blitz may give you a quick dopamine hit, but it won’t give you the deep joy of a well-played game. It’s like speed dating versus a long, romantic dinner—you might get a thrill, but you’ll miss out on the substance.

Next time you feel the urge to blitz, take a deep breath. Remember, chess is a game of kings and queens, knights and bishops—a grand battle of wits, not just a race against the clock. So pour yourself a cup of coffee, take a seat, and play a slower game. Your brain—and your win rate—will thank you. 

Happy thinking, and may your queen always stay loyal to her king!",1,1731956835.0,lichess,4,0.6,False

I had always spoke about following my dream doing something with music full time, and she was obviously not 100% on board right away, but with alot of talking and planning, it happened, and its going amazingly.

I joined a band as the frontman/ lead guitarist. We saw almost immediate success when we started. Our shtick was pretending to be a bunch of 9-5 workers coming off the clock and performing after work, our name is related to that too. We usually wear wrinkly baggy suits with coffee stains and the likes to really get into it.

I've met so many wonderful people at bars, venues, made so many connections that way and started performing at alot of weddings.

My gf has come to only one show and she just seemed, humiliated? She never likes to share that I am in a band, I honestly think she finds this stuff really embarassing, I dont think she likes how we dress up as like nerdy dudes and pretend to be geeks that play heavy stuff.

She's usually quite open and isnt afraid to say things, which is why this hurts so much worse.

I dont even think me talking to her about it will change anything, I just feel like its unfair of me to even be upset about anything in the first place because she was so supportive. Overall, I just feel really sad and hurt she cant enjoy this is as much as I do.

We vibe really well and have had deep conversations talking about our lives and even past relationships. At the end of the night we had our first kiss and she was even giggling as I kissed her because she was nervous/excited (she’s never had a boyfriend)

I can already tell that I really like her and want to keep seeing her. She wants to keep seeing me too, but I still don’t know for sure if she wants something as serious as I do.

My previous relationship got messed up because she blindsided me telling me she wasn’t looking for anything serious while I was. This was partly my fault because I just assumed she was for some reason without actually communicating about it. So I’m a bit scarred from that, and I feel that I should ask this new girl .

However, my fear is that this question will scare her and put pressure on her which I definitely do not want. I feel like if we, instead, just go with the flow, it will end up naturally working out if she likes me the same way — and this avoids any awkward conversation.

I slowly caught feelings for her , but we often used to cutoff because of her ex boyfriend because I didn’t liked him and i was a bit arrogant but we were too close we used to meet after our school and tutor classes in evenings and soon after that cornona came and schools and everything went off , we used to chat alot and calls too and after some months I confessed my feelings to her and she replied with im in shock,what do you see in me ,im not even hot or beautiful,after that idk we stopped talking and again a cutoff then after 4 months she contacted me back again she broke the ice that were are you lets meet but she never talked about my confession like it never happened and again we came close we used to do cycling go on coffee dates talk day and night and we used to even hug and cuddle at her house when her parents were out she was always taking care of me and i did the same like each others support pillars after that the school got over we got ourselves in different uni but they were only 900m away from each other in distance, we had arguments and the argument about was the general friends she had i used to tell her that some people are not good for you and this happened twice because I didn’t wanted to loose her for some shithead because she was the first person who actually took care of me as i was very unstable emotionally because of some family issues and then after the argument one day she decided that we should cutoff to heal what we have she said give me time and space and give yourself time it would be good for ourselves and after argument we cutoff and after 4 months i saw her snapchat story with other guy holding her hands and posting selfie ,i congratulated her said stay happy:)
After that we never really talked maybe once about how ugly her uni people are in nature even i asked to catch up but she refused its been 3 years now and from a long time and she tries to talk to me send hints to me to break the ice and initiate the conversation or to make a first move but idk what she feels for me  and im not the same person anymore i have mu goals and getting in a good shape i do gym i play supports i drive my car and mod and tune the engine and i have limited friend circle i earn im focused but wheni was with her i never dressed well for any dates i never went to gym i never took care of myself and istead i was being dependent on her i realise that now how childish my behaviour and unseriousness was there now im in a good position in life but in this area idk what to do?I still love her with all my heart and I feel that even my soul craves for her idk why and is this even real.

1guckvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Aggressive_Estate757/comments/1guckvb/is_mild_bleeding_in_a_tooth_socket_okay_at_12/,Is mild bleeding in a tooth socket okay at 12 days after lower molar tooth extraction? Used syringe to clear out food and it bled.,"On day 11 (after a tooth extraction of a lower molar), I tried using the syringe/irrigation tool to clean food out of my tooth socket. The food moved but it began to bleed mildly afterward. I was so afraid that it had caused dry socket!!  It was my 2nd try at using the syringe and now I'm done with that thing.  I'll keep gently rinsing with salt water 3-4 times a day.  The bleeding stopped but during the next night (day 12/13), it bled a bit while I was in bed sleeping. Noticed it at 1:00am.  

No pain (only mild tenderness). No swelling. No bad breath/taste.

I am guessing that I must have irritated the tender tissue. Is this okay/normal?  Will this delay my healing? Will it be like starting my healing all over again?

I have white granulation tissue over the area. Do you suppose that a piece of that may have been washed away and caused the bleeding? Or is it the blood clot bleeding? Or just the skin on my gums/socket?

Lots of questions, I know...but I am worried. I almost made it to the 2-week mark without any issues whatsoever...and now this. Just when I thought that the dry socket risk might be over and I could get back to drinking coffee, eating tomato-based pasta sauces, eating chewy foods, using minty toothpaste, lifting things heavier than 5lbs, etc.) I was looking forward to reaching the 14th day and having the area fully healed.

I am concerned that maybe I won't heal up at all.  Has anyone else had this? Did you eventually heal up? Did it take longer for your socket to fully heal? Am I just a slow healer, perhaps?

Can I still return to eating/drinking regular stuff at the 2-week mark or wait it out another couple weeks?  

Thank you, in advance, for any answers that you can provide. 
I just need someone to help put my mind at ease.

1gucei3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1gucei3/aita_for_cutting_off_my_best_friendpotential_lover/,AITA for cutting off my best friend/potential lover?,"Hello listeners from THT, before I start I just wanted to say that I've been a listener for about a year now & I absolutely LOVE THIS PODCAST! Keep this up Morgan! & as for my first Reddit story I believe you guys deserve to have a take on it first. So let me just start this mess up;

I (F25) have been friends with (M25) for 10 years, (I will be calling him ""N"") ever since freshman year. We had a couple classes together, so it wasn't hard making N a friend. He was funny, smart, very sarcastic even though he was very quiet & shy in school, I'd like to believe he was himself around me. And so maybe he grew a crush on me as well as I did for him, but even though I am sure it took some big guts to ask me out one day after school. I rejected him. I didn't reject him bc I didn't think he wasn't cute or attractive, he is an amazing guy, but I respected the amazing friendship we had made that I was being selfish on my end bc I didn't want to lose it. I of course told him these things and how I felt about loosing his friendship if something didn't work out between us if we were to be in a relationship. He of course took some time & distance towards me, which I respected. 

Second semester comes and things are kinda back to normal, we never spoke about it again after that which didn't seem to bother any of us. Our friendship was still cool, in between the years of high school we both had our bfs/gfs & would even share some of our relationships to each other. We got even more closer after graduation. Maybe bc we were older & had accepted the good friendship we had. I was there when he would have parties with family and our friends. His parents seemed to like me a lot too that they would ask him to invite me more to family events. Our friendship was genuine. 

Moving forward to 2021 he ended up moving out of state bc of his work. We of course would still stay in contact and would always make time to get together to hang out when he was in town for holidays or family events. During that time I was in a very serious relationship with my ex who I started dating in 2016, I moved in with him in 2018 until 2021 when I ended my relationship with him. For context, N at the time had no idea I had ended my relationship and why. If I had told him right there and then I know it would've been a problem, the reason being is bc I ended my relationship over domestic violence issues where I ended up putting my ex in jail. So I kept it a secret until a couple months later after he had moved away, he even came int town to check on me and see how I was doing so I updated him up with everything that had happened. 

Our friendship stayed the same updates here and there until I decided to join the gym, N is a major gym rat, that's when our friendship slowly started evolving into something else. Towards the end of Dec so starting Jan of this year, we kinda acted different specially me I am a shy person when it comes to liking someone so it was obvious I had grown some feelings towards him, I am certain he sensed it too. In Feb. N took a big step confessing himself since he asked me to be his valentines even when he was out of state, he made sure his presence was there by sending me a lovely bouquet. So you guess it, we started talking romantically. You can say I've been over the moon with him this man has been trying, the true definition of ""if he really wanted to he would"" bc I can feel that he does want me.

Everything was good until recently a couple months back he sorta started showing somewhat yellow to redish flags. I am not sure if he started getting insecure since he was away a lot bc of his job and was maybe only able to come down 2-3 times in a course of 6months. Which to me I didn't mind waiting to see him I enjoyed our time together and apart as well, plus it was only going to be temporary. I liked this guy; even as close to loving him, how he was with me, how he treated me, and him in general as a person, I've known him for years and have been an amazing friend if not my best friend, I fully trusted him. Until now. 

The beginning of Sep. he went into a let's call it ""internship"" where he didn't had no contact with the outside world for the training part of it. This lasted almost 4 weeks, I of course was still sending him msgs here and there to update him even when he was away. As soon as this man was able to get a hold of me more like his phone he bombed me with questions after questions, some were goofy almost like joking to get a giggle since we haven't been talking and some were pretty serious. In those questions he put a lot of ""what if's"" like what if he cheats or vise versa etc. He went as far as to randomly ask me how many guys I've been with, I was caught by surprise bc I've always been honest and we have talked about us not really getting into detail about our pasts mostly bc I strongly believe it does not matter. Knowing how extremely jealous he can be, I double asked if he was sure he wanted to go that route? he said yes and so I told him, to tell you he was upset would be an understatement. This man was probably foaming by the mouth. N was going bonkers bc I mentioned that not all guys treated me like shit and admitted I had 2 men that treated me nice and even brought my standards higher in a good way. This man was not taking it well. Claiming I was glorifying these men that I've been with. This turned into an argument that left a sour taste in my mouth about how immature he was acting about something he wanted to know so bad. Also demanding I should be saying ""F#ck every men but him"" and also put a what if situation that if I were to ever speak to them again I would be disrespecting him. Even if it was a short hi from running into each other at the grocery store. (again all his stupid scenarios in his head.) 

Now for what felt like forever, the next 2 business days seemed to be calmer until, there was a ""I need to tell you something."" text from N. I was at work and when I got to it I had 20 min before my break, well let's just say this man did not wait for me to even reply back and he just straight up blurred it out. This man confessed to me about him having HERPES. Back story, last time he came in town was for 4th of July weekend. Yes you can guess it we had sex for the first time too. So here I am 2 months later getting told this mfcker knowingly knew he had herpes and still never said anything to me about it. Went as far as not wearing protection at first but then I pressed him about wearing one so we did. But still he took that choice from me. He also dropped this info while not being present face to face type of conversation. 

This is serious shit, he knows how serious and how precautious I am about these type of things bc we've had open conversations about this. He had multiple chances to openly tell me about it bc I would ask about it I also even went as far as to go get checked before going into something with him for the safety of both of us. We had both came back ""clean"" but no he kept this detail from me his excuse being, ""I should have said something sooner but I was afraid of this outcome and kept pushing it back"" he also claimed he was planning on telling me back in July weekend but ""forgot about it."" HOW TF DO YOU FORGET TO MENTION YOU HAVE FCKN HERPES TO THE PERSON YOU CLAIM YOU CARE ABOUT?! exactly you don't. 

I feel betrayed, from my best friend and from my partner. Not only that but this man was being so ignorant about the whole situation, NEVER once was he worried about my health or offer me to go check myself bc like he called it, ""you should be good bc it's not active and I haven't infected anyone or had an outbreak since 2023"" also went as far as well it's not that big of a deal it's not like it's HIV, or how ""well 80% of the population have it they probably just don't know it"" like if I was going to be okay joining that 80% like it's a fucking sorority club. Also NOT educating me about it. I mentioned it to him 3 times until he sorta blurred some ""fun facts"" acting like this is blues clues, he really had me here asking for myself instead of him telling me about it from the start.

And before you guys ask me if he got it maybe when he moved out of state or cheated and that's how he got it or maybe he didn't know until recently. Nope this man got it since 2017 when his gf then was cheating sleeping around with several guys including him. All this time I thought we were close but he had this secret of him, which okay I can understand to wanting to keep it from a friend but to think it's okay to not tell me about it when I become a lover and someone they just had sex with is insane. And taking the choice for me, if I wanted or not to have sex with him or at least more safer sex knowing all the risks that can happen. No instead he chose for me. 

How can I ever trust him again or anything he says? oh I know I WILL NEVER AGAIN. N has been feeling bad about the whole situation but so have I, it took me 3 weeks to process it fully, my sleeping schedule was ruined bc of all the thinking, not only that but I also lost my appetite. He has been love bombing me non stop, flowers, letters, cute msgs etc. While I have been leaving him on read pretty much to talk to himself idc. 

Well I'm sure he was worried about where we stood so these past two weekends he has ""surprise visit"" me and his family bc his company is giving them ""4 day weekends"" which I don't believe but yet again I don't believe shit he says anymore. The famous ""surprise visit"" he claims was him showing up at my front door with more flowers and an ice coffee at 7 am on a school day for me. (I go to college) I accepted them for courtesy for my mother, since she's the one that let him in. So here I am standing in the living room with the person that literally mentally and emotionally fcked my head up and no one really knows about it. 

I walked him outside and told him there was no need for any of this and to stop love bombing me and to not show up again or I will kick him out next time around. He was begging for a chance to hear him out in person and I said fine I'll text you the info on where to meet. I let the weekend pass by, until Sunday night I sent him a msg of time and place and before I headed out, I had shared my location to a few of my friends and one specific one had instructions that if I didn't text back after 12 to call the police. I also took my gun with me, yeah it may sound all crazy but I was not going to risk going alone at night with someone who I thought I knew better. 

So I showed up maybe 15 min earlier to check my surroundings for more context it was our towns closest lake so I asked him to meet me at the deck. To tell you I thought this through, you bet I did; this man does not know how to swim so if it came down to self defense or anything like that I have maybe ""80%"" chance to get out of it alive. It's scary being a girl in this world and having to think these things but I am done being naive. N showed up, so we started talking mostly bc I kept pushing it to cut the bs and get straight to the point of it all. 

This man did not say anything that would've made me change my mind. So I told him I wasn't going to sit here and waste my fucking time any longer listening to shit I've already heard from him. He was still very confused on what was going to happen next with us. Like there was an us anymore? Regardless I let him down gently spearing you guys all the extra details. Told him even tho I wasn't certain about how I will get past this I had no intentions on continuing anything with someone that I cannot trust and I simply don't see them the same since I am very disappointed that not once did he really thought of how this would affect me or do to me. Instead he not only neglected being honest with me from the start but also even after he told me he was absolutely ignorant about it. I know I asked the question but now that I got to write most of it down, I will absolutely be okay with being the asshole in this story bc I will be cutting ties with N. 

People deserve honesty when it comes to something that can potentially cause you harm health wise, and the fact that he doesn't see it that way is not my problem. I also told him about how I hope the next girl he tries to talk to he mentions it before sex at least on the third date, since I wasn't the only one he told AFTER he had sex with them. He told his previous ex before me, a year into the relationship. And she allegedly didn't think it was a ""big deal"" so he also expected me to react the same. Hell no this man is delusional so in conclusion: FUCK THIS MAN.

1gucdsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gucdsc/dav_all_spoilers_the_most_egregiously_repeated/,[DAV ALL SPOILERS] The most egregiously repeated words and phrases in this game,"It drives me nuts that 20% of the dialog in this game is canned phrases and words that have been said 2,642 times already.

* This game could be renamed Dragon Age: The Venatori. Someone doesn't need to shriek ""the Venatori"" literally every single you enter combat and every single docktown quest contains a ramble about the Venatori. 

* Some variant of ""the crows always finish their contracts."" Yeah, we know. Also, you don't. Rook is doing it for you. 

* Food and coffee being described. In particular, I cannot fucking believe I had to hear the term ""ham jam slam"" sandwich three times in addition to ""yam jam slam."" I felt secondhand embarrassment. Also, did you guys know Lucanis likes coffee?!? 

* Some variant of Rook saying ""let's talk through this together"" like he's a shitty Better Help therapist or camp counselor and not the protagonist of an RPG where you kill dragons. It also makes all the characters, Harding in particular, feel even more child-coded than they already do. 

* Neve saying something cynical followed by Neve saying something about how she loves docktown. I feel that conversation happens like 60-times. Rook inevitably always assures Neve that she is docktowns one true savior. 

* Someone saying Rook's name unnecessarily. There is absolutely no reason for every character in the game to address him by his name while speaking to him. If you took a shot every time someone said Rook you would be dead in two-hours. The gods get the same treatment. Even worse, their names do not sound cool. 

* Conversations where the main topic is that the companion's personal problems are in fact the true priority and Rook is responsible for managing them. Someone pops up to remind you of this at least ten times. 

It's mystifying to me that no one took out their red pen and edited this or cut any of it out. It's extremely distracting to me. There are a lot more but I think everyone gets the idea.


* Edit: Rook says ""I'm here to help"" or ""what do you need."" ",26,1731956156.0,dragonage,35,0.69,False

However, it's kind of a pain to constantly clean the filter, carafe, add water and coffee. Additionally, a couple times a week, I enjoy an afternoon cup for a pick me up but I have to go through the process I laid out, regardless if I'm making one cup or 12. 

I was looking at a couple of the Keurigs but just curious if you think I will be disappointed with the intensity and/or temperature? And sorry for a dumb question but is there a water heat up period before brewing? My favorite part about the drip maker is that when I walk into the kitchen, still half asleep, I simply pour. 

I was looking at the K-Duo since it allows the option of grounds and another plus is my daughter would love the iced option it has. This unit seems like the best of both worlds but also seems to defeat the purpose of a Keurig if 90% of what I make is with the carafe side.

Just curious what everyone thinks, as there may be some holiday deals coming up. Thanks! ",1,1731955802.0,keurig,3,1.0,False

*  Moving helps move stuff to the car or truck. **Are there any local moving companies or teams you would recommend?**
* Get a truck (like UHAUL) or U-box (which is more expensive) to move stuff to the new location \~6.5 h drive south. **Any recommendations?**
* I am deciding whether to get a storage unit, keep furniture, or sell some things (Ikea dining table, coffee table, TV stand, 55-inch LG TV, a desk, a comfy living spaces sofa and two dining chairs). **Any suggestions for storage units?

So, I've been making iced coffee at home forever and it just has not worked out. The coffee is too watered down etc etc (i don't need to explain how much i dislike cold brew). I love lattes so much but I spend too much on them from cafes. 

  
So I decided I want to buy an espresso maker from home. Question is: Should I buy a nice beginner espresso machine (Breville Bambino Plus) or try out a cheap Nespresso machine first?

  
The purpose of the Nespresso machine is that I just want to see if I like the iced lattes I make at home. If I don't, well at least I didn't spend too much, and if I did like it, I'll upgrade to the Bambino Plus. 

I'm scared to spend $$ on something I won't enjoy and just be stuck with it.

I've been mostly lurking in this sub for the past 6 months while preparing for my trip to Disney. The last time I was there was back in 2009 and at that time I only went to Disneyland, not DCA. Needless to say a lot has changed since then and I had an absolutely fantastic time!

A little background info: I am a stay at home mom for 2 small children and this was a solo vacation for me. And wow, did it feel good to be able to do whatever I wanted all day. Walk as much as I can without tired littles, eat whatever I want without sharing, go to the bathroom without an audience. Truly the greatest idea I've ever had to plan this trip for myself.

I flew into John Wayne Airport from Texas. And took an Uber to one of the Good Neighbor hotel properties near Disney. That first day I went to Downtown Disney to do some souvenir shopping and had dinner at Jazz Kitchen. I got the gumbo poutine and an Abita Purple Haze. The poutine was terrible. Do not recommend. Then stopped at Beignets Expressed for dessert. Just got a bag of powdered sugar beignets so I could have quick breakfast food in my hotel room. These were fantastic!

**Next: Disney Parks Day!**

**5:45 am**

Alarm goes off. Got up, showered, and dressed. Ate one of my leftover beignets.

Packed my fanny pack: small card wallet, reusable straw (didn't use it), sunscreen stick, chapstick, dramamine (didn't use it), poncho (didn't use it), fuel rod, and one of those cheap drawstring backpacks. Kept my cell phone in my shorts pocket and wore my MagicBand+.

**6:15 am**

Went to the hotel lobby and got a coffee from Starbucks.

**6:30 am**

Left hotel to walk to the Harbor Blvd entrance to Disney.

**6:50 am**

Arrived at security, but had to wait 10 minutes for that to open up. It was colder in the morning than I was expecting. I had decided to just wear a t-shirt and shorts and then buy an extra layer in the evening if I got cold. But I hadn't thought about it being cold in the morning.

**7:10 am**

Through security and now waiting at the Disneyland gates. Only 3 people in front of me in my lane. While waiting for the gates to open, I entered the Virtual Queue for Haunted Mansion; group 48.

**7:35 am**

Inside the park and waiting next to the Adventureland path for rope drop. My plan is to go straight to Rise of the Resistance via Bayou (Critter) Country. I put in my 1st Lightning Lane pass for Smuggler's Run.

**8:00 am**

They drop the rope and I speed walk to Rise of the Resistance. It isn't open yet, so I go to Smuggler’s Run.

**8:10 am**

Enter Smuggler's Run. Get my next LL pass for Big Thunder Mountain.

**8:30 am**

Exit Smuggler's Run. I was assigned the gunner position. Rise still isn't open, so I go to Frontierland to get a breakfast chimichanga before my BTM LL.

**8:44 am**

Eating my delicious chimi and I see in the app that Rise is up and has 15 min standby. I scarf down the last couple of bites and book it over there.

**8:50 am**

I get in line for Rise and the standby time has already increased to 40 min.

**9:20 am**

Exit Rise. Holy shit! That was awesome!

Head over to BTM for my LL and run into Boba Fett. Grab a picture with him and keep going.

**9:25 am**

Enter BTM LL. Choose next LL for Pirates of the Caribbean.

**9:35 am**

Exit BTM. Bathroom break.

**9:45 am**

I check the Haunted Mansion VQ and it is getting close to my group. So I hop in line for Winnie the Pooh. 15 min standby.

**9:55 am**

Board my beehive.

**10:00 am**

Right as we're about to exit the building…the ride breaks down. End up sitting in the beehive for 10 min as they get everyone off and walk us out.

**10:10 am**

See Pooh and Tigger out taking photos.

While I was stuck on Pooh, my group was called for Haunted Mansion. So I go straight there.

**10:12 am**

Enter Haunted Mansion queue.

**10:32 am**

Haunted Mansion breaks down right as my buggy is about to finish the ride…is this going to be a theme today? 🤔

**10:37 am**

Exit HM. This breakdown was only about 5 min.

**10:45 am**

I stopped by Tiki Juice Bar and get a Dole Whip. This Disney trip was planned in conjunction with a cross stitch retreat and we are all meeting in front of the castle at 11 am for a group picture. So I head over there.

**11:00 am**

We take our group picture and catch a little Mary Poppins entertainment in front of the castle.

**11:10 am**

Entered Pirates LL. I plan on park hopping to DCA after this, so I get my next DL LL for Indiana Jones in the evening.

**11:35 am**

Exit Pirates. Then park hop over to DCA.

**11:45 am**

I stop at Shwarma Palace and get a Victory Falafel and a bottle of water. Most of the LL options for DCA are already pretty far out in the afternoon/evening and I plan on going back to Disneyland around 5 pm. So, I grab a pass for Soarin’ around 2 pm.

**11:50 am**

Got in line for Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout while eating my food and drinking my water. Standby 45 min.

**12:30 pm**

Exit Mission Breakout. Absolutely loved it! I've been on Tower of Terror at Hollywood Studios, so I was expecting a little drive around in the elevator car before the drops/lifts. Boy was I surprised!

**12:32 pm**

Got in the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racers.

**1:00 pm**

Exit RSR.

**1:12 pm**

Pick up a Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita from Cozy Cone #4.

**1:26 pm**

I head over to Pixar Pal-A-Round. I tried amping myself up for a swinging gondola but chicken out and get in the non-swinging line instead. 20 min standby.

**1:55 pm**

Exit Pal-A-Round. Bathroom break.

**2:05 pm**

Enter Soarin’ LL. Incredicoaster has been closed all morning, but I see it is now available for LL and I nab a pass.

**2:37 pm**

Exit Soarin’

**2:40 pm**

On my way back over to Avengers Campus, I see people crowding for the Spiderman flip thingy, so I wait there to watch the show.

**2:52 pm**

Enter Web Slingers single rider lane.

**3:19 pm**

Exit Web Slingers. I don't know why people hate on this ride so much. I thought it was so much fun!

**3:25 pm**

Back in line for Mission Breakout. 50 min standby. I bought myself a churro to eat while I wait. I forgot to record my exit time.

**4:20 pm**

Enter Incredicoaster LL.

**4:36 pm**

Exit Incredicoaster. I mobile order myself a peanut butter cold brew from Cappuccino Cart and go sit over there to wait for my pick up window.

**4:53 pm**

Coffee acquired and I park hop back over to DL.

**5:00 pm**

Back in DL. The sun is setting and it’s starting to get chilly, so I stop in a couple of Main Street shops to find an extra layer to buy for my souvenir. I end up picking out a beige spirit jersey with the Disneyland letters that look like different Disney characters. I get a LL pass for Star Tours.

**5:20 pm**

Enter Star Tours LL. Get a LL pass for Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster.

**5:40 pm**

Exit Star Tours. This ride feels really lackluster now that Smuggler's Run is an option. Head straight over to Astro Blaster LL.

**6:00 pm**

I get to experience another ride breakdown when my ride is almost over. But this one is only a minute or two before it starts back up again. Exit Astro Blaster. Get LL pass for BTM.

**6:05 pm**

I'm hungry, so I stop at Edelweiss Snacks for a cheesy garlic pretzel brat and bottle of water. Then sit on a bench to eat and rest my feet while waiting for my LL window.

**6:20 pm**

I realize my MagicBand+ has died when I try to check in for BTM LL. So now I have to use my phone to check in.

**6:35 pm**

Exit BTM. Get a Space Mountain LL for 11 pm. And bathroom break.

**6:41 pm**

Enter Jungle Cruise. 20 min standby.

**7:00 pm**

Exit Jungle Cruise.

**7:01 pm**

Enter Indiana Jones LL.

**7:23 pm**

Exit Indiana Jones. I get a notification that my Space Mountain LL has been changed to a multi experience pass since Space Mountain is down. Also, my phone tells me it's dying (15% battery) so I plug it into my fuel rod.

**7:35 pm**

I stop at Hungry Bear BBQ Jamboree for the strawberry pickle lemonade. It is fantastic!

**7:40 pm**

I go back over to Rise of the Resistance.  40 min standby. I have a slot booked at Oga's Cantina for 8:30 pm, but I decide to try to squeeze this ride in before.

**8:30 pm**

Exit Rise. I book it over to Oga's Cantina.

**8:35 pm**

I stand at the bar in Oga's and order a Fuzzy Tauntaun and Spiced Wroshyr Pods. After finishing those I choose to get a second drink and the bartender recommends an Outer Rim, so I get that.

**9:10 pm**

I leave Oga's and sit on the ground near the Millennium Falcon while waiting for the fireworks to start.

**9:43 pm**

Enter Smugglers single rider after fireworks. The ride breaks down at 9:53 pm about 75% through our ride. We were about to jump to lightspeed when the screens quit and the lights came up. Which is such a Millennium Falcon thing to do, probably a faulty hyperdrive.

**10:05 pm**

Exit Smugglers and are given a multi pass LL because of the ride break down. But I never end up using it because it's so late.

**10:13 pm**

While looking at my LL options I see that Matterhorn is working (it was down all day). So I go there and enter the single rider line.

**10:24 pm**

Right before we can disembark, the CM moves our bobsled sideways, I think to prevent a pile up while they have a boarding issue further up, and we end up having to wait for the log jam to clear before he slides us back into position.  He offers to let us go around again without getting off and the 6 of us accept.

**10:32 pm**

Exit Matterhorn for real this time. Bathroom break. I check one last time if Space Mountain has come back up, and no such luck. So I walk over to Main Street to buy some souvenirs for my kids. My oldest requested a snow globe with Minnie Mouse and thankfully they have one for Christmas. My youngest is too young to talk, but loves water bottles. So I get her a Minnie Mouse one.

**11:05 pm**

Officially calling it quits. I exit the park and walk over to the Toy Story lot shuttles. I didn’t park there, but my hotel is nearby that lot. So it saves my feet the extra walking.

**11:32 pm**

Back in my hotel room with my sore feet and quarter sized blisters on the inside of each heel. I think I need to invest in some orthotic inserts to fix my over-pronation before I try walking this much in one day again.

**The next day:**

My flight home didn't leave until 5 pm, so I decided to book a character dining experience.

After check out, I walked (which hurt…a lot) to the Disneyland Hotel for brunch at Goofy's Kitchen. The bell services at the Disneyland Hotel let me leave my bag with them while I dined there even though I wasn't staying at the property. Not sure if this is necessarily allowed, but they never asked me for a room number when I asked to drop it off.

This was the first time I'd ever done character dining. It was fun…but I don't think I'd do it as a solo adult again. It's kinda awkward. But being solo in the parks was absolutely not awkward at all. It was awesome!

I am super happy with how my day at the parks went. I managed to hit every ride I wanted to, except for Space Mountain. And some of my favorites I got to do twice! This was definitely a day that I had to do by myself. I don't think I personally know a single person who could've kept this pace with me today. Physically, my husband could, but mentally, no. I only sat down (other than on rides) thrice all day (when I got coffee, when I got the cheesy garlic pretzel brat, and while waiting for fireworks). I also learned that I am getting too old for this level of activity, since I'm pretty sure I ended up with shin splints and couldn't walk very well the next day.

I started a cottage food bakery in January of this year. I have always worked in kitchens and went to culinary school so it’s something I know well. My main goal of starting was to bring in a little bit of side income while staying home with my daughter. The entrepreneurial side of me quickly took over and I went from selling 5-10 items a week to 50-60 and sometimes more quickly. 
Now I have been given the opportunity to gain some amazing retail contracts. They would gross me conservatively 12k a month and they hope to bring back some items they have discontinued since they are not happy with their baker. Along with a few other contracts who would need less but still consistent selling in coffee shops small mom and pop retail ect that I have been hesitant to accept. 
The problem is I’m terrified. I already have all my own industrial equipment. But with these contracts I would need to rent a space and upgrade my license. Going from relatively low overhead (my home) to renting a space is a scary thought. But the thought of getting my home back is also very exciting. I would also need to upgrade my license from cottage to commercial.
I guess my question as I sit here waiting to hear back from a few places I have inquired on is was anyone ever terrified instead of excited to expand? Even though it means much better money and opportunity it comes with far more risk. I have a solid customer base and have not been able to keep up with demand from my community so this would also allow me to increase production way more and fulfill those requests.

- Preheating the picopresso, weighing out 17/18g of beans, medium roast, have tried with 0.4/0.6 setting on the grinder, recommendation is 1-3. 
- Using the stock basket and funnel, using the stock WDT tool, followed by tamping with the distribution ring on and again without it.

1gubw7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/comments/1gubw7a/why_you_cant_get_lost_in_universes_while_shifting/,Why You can't Get Lost in Universes while Shifting? ,"So, I’ve seen a lot of people worrying about getting “lost” in another universe when shifting, and I wanted to break it down in a way that’s simple and (hopefully) reassuring.

Here’s the deal: if you believe in the multiverse (which most of us here do), then there are literally infinite versions of every possible reality. Yes, infinite.





What Does Infinity Even Mean?

Infinity isn’t a number. You can’t measure it. It’s not like there’s one exact version of your Desired Reality (DR) sitting in a huge pile of other universes. It’s more like there are infinite versions of your DR, with tiny differences across all of them.

For example:

There’s a version where your DR exists exactly as you scripted it.

There’s another version where everything is the same, except you sneezed yesterday.

And another where you didn’t sneeze but drank tea instead of coffee.

You get the idea... Right?





Why You Can’t Get Lost

Because there are infinite universes, the chances of being “lost” or landing in a universe that doesn’t suit you are, mathematically speaking, 1:infinity. And that’s… impossible. Infinity doesn’t “run out” of your DR or its variations.

Now, here’s where it gets even better:

Your intent (what you want and focus on) is like a GPS. It guides you straight to the universe you want to experience.

Even if your focus wavers, you’ll land in a universe close enough to your DR that you probably won’t notice the difference.





Why Intent is Key

Shifting isn’t random. You’re not just throwing yourself into a cosmic lottery and hoping for the best. Your script and intention are what guide you. Think of it like typing an address into Google Maps: you’re telling the multiverse exactly where you want to go, and that’s where it’ll take you.

""I want to shift to the Marvel universe"" 

Even Marvel have their infinite version of themselves, no? 




TL;DR

Infinity = endless possibilities, so your DR exists (and so do infinite versions of it).

The probability of getting “lost” is literally impossible (1:infinity).

Your script + intention = your shifting GPS.

You’re safe, and you’ll always end up where you want to be.


So, relax. Trust yourself. You’ve got this.",3,1731954980.0,shiftingrealities,4,0.67,False

Basically, it was a short segment about Iceland, shot in Iceland, and narrated by an Icelandic person. The thing that stuck with me is the sentence, ""[we or Iceland] has/have more bands than families"". If I remember correctly, this narration was played over a clip of some teenagers in a garage holding guitars/standing behind a drumkit and not playing. I think the whole thing was about why music was so important to Icelanders. 

The most likely time I wouid have seen this was in the mid 90s during Dawn Patrol in the early morning, I watched it every day as I got ready for school (and I have a distinct memory of discovering the video for Blur's Coffee and TV from there), but I watched MTV pretty regularly through the early 2000s for Daria and through the TRL era, so it could be from as late as 2004. But from what I remember of the clothes, it feels more 90s.

I'm 99% sure it was MTV, but I also watched a lot of Nick and VH1 as well in that era, so it might be from one of those channels, but the vibe of the clip was very MTV. ",3,1731954930.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False
1gubulb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1gubulb/kbg_louder_and_making_too_much_steam_after/,KBG louder and making too much steam(?) after descaling,"To preface, I'm coming up on my 5th year with my KBG that I've owned since new.  I descale regularly after 100 brews (first used Dezcal before switching to Biocaf).  On my last descale, I let the solution sit for the longest I ever have, probably 30+ min, before turning on the brewer to let it run through the system.

I noticed afterwards that the ""bubbling"" sound became a lot louder than normal.  There was no whine from the system, which I've noticed happen in the past when it's getting close to the time I need to descale (this is what I expect for my system).

[Bubbling\/gurgling sound now much louder than before](https://reddit.com/link/1gubulb/video/ih5bukfidp1e1/player)



The noise, I can probably learn to live with eventually, but the more annoying thing is there's a lot more splashing, or maybe a lot more steam, being generated in the brew basket.  It's to the point where condensation builds up quickly under the lid and leaks out from the side and also shoots out from the gap under the arm and runs down the water reservoir.  It also makes it a bit of a mess to take the basket lid off since coffee-tinged water drips everywhere.

The underside of the shower arm is now soaked from coffee splashing or moisture coming up during the brew.  Look to the left of the holes, I clean the arm after every brew so this is not buildup... nothing has ever reached up there during a brew prior to this issue.  I fill the water reservoir between the 6 and 8 cup marks, FWIW.

[Never had this much splash](https://preview.redd.it/w3v8pd1pdp1e1.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f75d1b5a94296acc667ba722a25fdb4df1fefd70)



I also noticed that the grinds after brewing didn't have the big dip in the middle that's typical of the original style shower arm with the flat holes, so something has definitely changed.  It now looks pretty uniform, which oddly enough, is what people were after before the redesigned arm???

[I now have a relatively even soak in the brew basket](https://preview.redd.it/tacxvq8ddp1e1.jpg?width=1428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e271749038b9d12f6650e535304ba23000a49625)

Any ideas on what's going on?  Could it be that this was how it used to be those \~5 yrs ago and I just don't remember, and this last descale knocked some gunk loose?

Basically, I struggled with a lot of food noise and intense cravings that aren’t really reasonable, and are definitely not caused by hunger. I just have a humongous sweet tooth and I’m addicted to sugar like a maniac. Before I tried fasting, I swear I could down a mountain of chewy oatmeal cookies and still crave some more. 

Nowadays I’m satisfied with having one and savouring it with a nice cup of coffee. It’s weird. I feel fasting helped me reset my gut in a way. I feel more in control and I can sense how sick I would feel if I ate more back to back cookies… 

Weightloss tips aren’t a one size fits all type of thing, so I can’t assure fasting would work for others, it could even make things worse. Though it works so well for me compared to a strict daily calorie budget.

Looking for a lip color that lasts all day? I recently tried COVERGIRL's Outlast Lipstain in the shade All-Star, and I'm impressed with its staying power.

This vegan formula glides on smoothly with its pen-like tip. I found it easy to apply and build up the color for a bold look. The satin finish gives a nice sheen without being too glossy. I like that it feels lightweight on my lips and doesn't transfer onto cups or clothes.

https://preview.redd.it/p68w3uutep1e1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f404bc188698341300cfb02940aad876f1969458

One thing I noticed is that it doesn't feel drying like some long-lasting lip products can. The plant-based acacia tree extract might be helping with that. I appreciate that it's cruelty-free too.

The color lasted through meals and drinks without needing touch-ups. It faded evenly over time instead of flaking off. While the shade range is decent with 14 options, some people might want more choices.

# Bottom Line

I think the COVERGIRL Outlast Lipstain is a good pick for anyone wanting long-lasting lip color without the heavy feel of lipstick. It's easy to use and stays put all day.



# COVERGIRL Outlast 05 All-Star Lipstain: A Game-Changer in Beauty

I recently tried the Outlast Lipstain from COVERGIRL, and I'm really impressed. This vegan formula glides on smoothly with its pen-like tip. The color is buildable and lasts for hours without feeling heavy.

I love that it's transfer-proof. I ate and drank without worrying about smudges. The satin finish looks natural and feels fresh all day.

One downside is that it can be a bit drying. I fixed this by applying lip balm first. The color range is good, but some shades look brighter on the lips than expected.

Applying it takes a steady hand. The pen design is compact but needs practice for even coverage.

It's great for long days when I don't want to reapply makeup. The lightweight feel is a big plus compared to regular lipsticks.

# Revolutionary Precision Pen Application

I was impressed by the pen-like applicator on this Covergirl lip stain. It made putting on the color a breeze. The tip is precise, so I could easily define my lip shape without mess. I liked how smoothly it glided on my lips. It felt lightweight and didn't drag or tug. The pen design let me build up the color gradually. I could do a light stain or layer it for more impact. It was simple to get an even look all over my lips. The applicator made touch-ups quick and easy too. I found it much more user-friendly than traditional lipstick tubes or wands.

# Kiss-Proof and Transfer-Proof Technology

I put this lip stain to the test, and I'm impressed. The Outlast lipstain stays put through eating, drinking, and yes, even kissing. I applied it in the morning and was amazed to see the color still going strong hours later. No smudges on my coffee cup or transfer to my partner's cheek. The lightweight feel is a big plus - I often forgot I was wearing anything at all. It's not perfect though. While it lasts a long time, it can fade unevenly if you're not careful. And if you have dry lips, it might emphasize flaky patches. But for a long-lasting, low-maintenance lip color, this Covergirl stain is hard to beat.

# Lightweight, Non-Drying Formula

I love how this lip stain feels on my lips. It's so light, I forget I'm wearing it. The formula doesn't dry out my lips like some other stains I've tried. I can wear it all day without that tight, uncomfortable feeling. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel sticky. The plant-based ingredients seem to help keep my lips soft. I can build up the color if I want more intensity, but even one swipe gives a nice wash of color. It's great for everyday wear when I want my lips to look naturally tinted without feeling heavy or cakey.

# A Vibrant Spectrum of 14 Shades

I tried the new Outlast Lipstain and was impressed by the range of colors. The 14 shades offer something for everyone. I found the colors vibrant and long-lasting. The All-Star shade is a bold red that stayed put all day. I liked how I could build up the color for a more intense look. The pen-like tip made it easy to apply precisely. The formula felt light on my lips and didn't dry them out. It's great that it's vegan too. While the color lasted well, it did fade a bit after eating. Overall, I think this lipstain is a good choice for those wanting long-wearing color.

# Pros and Cons

After trying out the Covergirl Outlast Lipstain, I've got some thoughts to share. This pen-style lip color has its ups and downs. Let's break it down:

# Pros

* The pen-like tip makes it easy to apply with precision. I found I could outline my lips and fill them in without much fuss.
* It's super lightweight. I barely felt like I was wearing anything on my lips.
* The color lasts for hours. I drank coffee and ate lunch, and it stuck around.
* It's transfer-proof. No lipstick marks on my coffee cup or my partner's cheek.
* The vegan formula is a plus for those who care about animal-friendly products.

# Cons

* The color can be more intense than expected. What looks like a soft pink in the pen might show up as a bright pink-red on the lips.
* It can feel drying after a while. I needed to use lip balm on top to keep my lips comfy.
* Some shades apply unevenly. I had to go over certain areas multiple times to get even coverage.
* The pen design means you can't see how much product is left.
* It takes practice to get the application right. My first try was a bit messy.

I like that it stays put and feels light, but the drying effect and color surprise were downsides for me. It's a good option if you want long-lasting color without the heaviness of lipstick, but be ready for some trial and error with shades and application.

# Customer Reviews: Real Experiences

I've tried this lip stain and found it has some good points. Many users like how it goes on smoothly and lasts a long time. The pen-like tip makes it easy to apply neatly. Some people love the bright colors, while others think they look too bold. A few reviewers said it can feel a bit drying, but using lip balm helps. The stain doesn't smudge or feather for most users. I noticed mixed feedback on how well it covers - some find it works great, while others say it takes a lot of product. Overall, people seem happy with how long it stays on, even when eating and drinking. The smell got positive comments too. While not perfect for everyone, many find it a good option for long-lasting lip color.

# Cruelty-Free Commitment and Vegan Formula

I was thrilled to discover that this Outlast Lipstain is both cruelty-free and vegan. CoverGirl has really stepped up their game. The formula includes plant-based acacia tree extract, which I found to be a nice touch. It's great to see a big brand moving away from animal testing and animal-derived ingredients. This lip stain proves you don't need to sacrifice quality for ethics. I felt good wearing it, knowing no animals were harmed in its production. The vegan formula still delivered the smooth application and long-lasting color I expected. It's a win for animal lovers and makeup enthusiasts alike.

# Conclusion

After trying this COVERGIRL lip stain, I'm impressed with its performance. The pen-like applicator makes it easy to use, and the color lasts for hours without smudging. I like that it's transfer-proof, so I don't have to worry about it coming off on cups or clothes. The satin finish looks natural and feels comfortable on my lips. While it can be a bit drying, a quick swipe of lip balm fixes that. The vegan formula is a nice bonus for those who prefer cruelty-free products. For anyone looking for long-lasting lip color that's simple to apply, this lip stain is worth checking out. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done well.",1,1731954836.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

This has been asked before but I just wanted some guidance for those that have been on it for a bit. Everything I found lead me down a rabbit hole that didn't feel helpful.

My MD prescribed me Concerta to try out and I took it for the first time yesterday.

I'm on the lowest dose to start, and took it at 9 am yesterday.  For the first time I felt awake and able to think and not be over run with Anxiety. It was a wild experience **but**

I had **THE WORST** fucking sleep of my life and I'm a parent. I've struggled with sleep all my life mostly due to anxiety but this was something else. I fell asleep, woke up after 2 hrs and it took me maybe 2-3 hrs after that to fall asleep and that's with sitting in the dark with my eyes closed and just trying to relax. It was fucking horrendous. I'm lucky if I got 4 hours total last night before I took it at 7am today.

I *did* have coffee (a mocha) until maybe 9pm last night as I was starting to crash and I *rarely* ever drink any coffee which maybe exacerbated it?
 I usually drink Iced Chai tea which is black tea but now I'm freaked out if I drink that I'll be up all night again. 

I know this can be a side effect but holy fuck how long does that last 


I'm going to try melatonin tonight to help facilitate falling asleep but are there any other tips? 
The insomnia was so bad I almost didn't want to take it again this morning.


Sorry for the long post. I'm struggling.

That post was written probably a week after I got both the ZP6 and the C60 at SCAA Expo Chicago, so after heavy use, my perspective has somewhat shifted. So, I thought it would be fair and useful to write an update :) I have a lot to say, so I'll break it down into sections and do a TLDR at the end if you just want the main takeaways. 

**Background on me and personal considerations**

I am a coffee farmer from El Salvador, so my expectations and use cases might differ from most enthusiasts. That being said, I am an enthusiast and a gear head that loves trying new coffee gear, and nothing excites me more than grinders! However, I don’t only use my grinders at home. My farm is in a different part of the country, so I travel there many times during the week. I do bring my grinder with me. In these past 7 months, I have brought my C60 and ZP6 to coffee expos in Europe, vacation, friends houses, cuppings with clients, and just about anywhere I go, I bring a grinder, My Acaia Lunar and a Zebrang V60.

For me, a good grinder is one with consistent particle distribution, portable, and durable. These are the criteria I will be using to evaluate these different grinders over the last 7 months. I know different brew methods, techniques, and user error will affect every cup, so comparing would be difficult this way. So when it comes to cup profiles, I'll just stick to my thoughts on cuppings following SCA guidelines and SCA roasting guidelines for cuppings (75 Agtron) I’ve had during the past 7 months with clients that have come to visit the farms. The beans used are beans from my and my family's farms that we have been selling for years, so I know them very well. So the only thing changing between cuppings has been the grinder. The beans used range from Sarchimors in natural and washed processes ranging from 94-96 avg cupping scores to our three-time Cup of Excellence winning natural geisha, and a wild card being an experimental lot of geisha processed as a carbonic maceration. In the time between my original post and this one, I bought a DiFluid Omni, so I have a very good idea of particle distribution through different settings.

 **C40**

 I figured I'd start with this one as it has been my main grinder for years, the only one of which I have nothing bad to say and is my baseline. This is just a great grinder that I would recommend to anyone. Sure, there are grinders with similar profiles that work about the same for cheaper, but I believe the tactile experience and build quality is still superior to those, so if price isn't really a concern and you value how it clicks and fits together, this one is hard to ignore. 

I think most of us enthusiasts have owned or tried one, so most of us know the cup profile on this grinder. To me, it’s just a very easy cup that tastes amazing with any bean you throw at it, regardless of the roast level or origin. You get a balanced cup with a rich body, sweetness, acidity, and clarity. This grinder is light, easy to travel with, and my only concern with it is the veneer, which can be easily marked or damaged in field use, but keeping it in a travel case negates this weakness. I haven’t used this one as much because I gifted it to my father about two months ago (Ill get to why in the conclusion), but I believe this is the best all-rounder of the grinders compared in this post. One thing that is remarkable about this grinder is how consistent it is between grind settings. The distribution curve stays very consistent, and the fines stay around 14% with negligible differences coming mostly from bean density. 

**C60**

I think I might've been a little too harsh on this grinder in my initial comparison. My drawbacks remain true: it's heavy! 1kg (0.45 lbs for stateside friends), and the higher bean throughput and wider diameter burr make it harder to grind. The grinding experience is smoother, but you need considerably more strength to do so. 

The cup profile is virtually identical to the C40. I’ve seen some people saying they found more clarity in the C60; however, that has not been my personal experience. To me, it’s the same, and that can also be seen with how it behaves at different settings. The curve remains just as consistent as on the C40. Surprisingly though, my omni finds more fines from the C60, 15% on average. However, I have not found this to be noticeable in cuppings. Maybe comparing them side by side again, but when doing cuppings, I expect and get the same results from either comandante grinder. 

An unexpected benefit of this grinder has been the durability. I’ve dropped this thing twice on tiled floors and see no damage. This thing is a tank! I’ve also found an advantage for the inner clicking system. Being inside the grinder protects it from drops (something that will become relevant when we get to the ZP6). This might be a pain point for most, but if you travel and bring it everywhere, this is the superior adjustment system. 

Speaking of the adjustment system, I do find the goldclix very useful. However, I absolutely loathe the odd-shaped knob. I’ve cut myself countless times resetting the grinder by holding the knob and turning the crank. Be very careful with this as the burr is super sharp, and this being rounder means you’ll have to curl your finger around it to get a proper grip, and that’s where you will cut yourself if you’re not mindful of where your finger is. But the fine tuning is greatly appreciated compared to the C40, and translating settings between both grinders is just multiplying the C40 settings by 1.4. 

Because of the added durability, finer adjustment, and same performance as the C40, the C60 has become my main grinder. I actually value those things over the weight and difficulty turning (your mileage may vary here; I do concede that a more expensive grinder shouldn't be harder to turn). Speaking of expensive, I see these are selling for $600ish. I paid $500 for mine in Chicago at the SCAA expo earlier this year. Since I move a lot and portability is paramount for me, I don’t have an electric grinder, so I don’t mind the price. However, it is a lot of money, and that’s where the C40 takes the edge and why it would be my recommendation for someone looking for a grinder. 

**ZP6**

This thing is awesome for certain coffees. There is no denying you get superior clarity from it. It’s easier to use, lighter, and the smoothest grinding experience out of the bunch. That being said, it has some unexpected major flaws that have become a dealbreaker for me.

Let's start with the bad first, and the absolute worst is durability. I keep my grinders on a shelf over my brew bar. While it’s thinner and easier to grip, the centre of gravity is higher, and I had an earthquake a couple of months ago that knocked it over and dropped it to the tiled floor. Being top-heavy, it landed on the adjustment ring, and being aluminium, it dented to the point where the adjustment section jammed and essentially broke the grinder. I know, foolish me, but this hasn’t happened to me with any other grinder before, and really highlighted the flaws in weight distribution and having an exposed adjustment system. Fixing it was cheap and easy after contacting 1Zpresso, but the materials and design of the grinder made me very aware of how fragile it is in non-home settings. I would be very concerned about bumping it into things or accidentally knocking it over (which is surprisingly easy to do). I now keep it in a case and only take it out to brew and put it back in when I’m done.

My biggest flaw with it comes from its biggest selling point and strength, and that is cup profile. While it has a lot of clarity and very few fines, it’s got some major issues in this department. For one, the superior performance is only present in a very narrow section of the overall adjustment system (where you’ll be for pour-overs), but go finer or coarser than this, and the distribution curve varies wildly. This isn’t just in overall particle distribution, but fines as well. In the pour-over range, it’s consistently around 12% fines, but stray from this range, and you can get between 14-17% fines and also boulders if you go coarser. The clarity is a great asset for some coffees, especially naturals and fermentations like the carbonic maceration geisha, however, in a cupping setting, it punishes washed coffees as it drastically decreases the overall body and sweetness of these coffees. This is not a problem with naturals and fermentations as they tend to have more body anyway, but be very mindful of the beans you’re using with it, as you might be better off with a grinder with more fines.

I can’t stress how good this thing is for pour-overs, but I do recommend it for natural coffees only, as I mentioned before, it reduces the body and sweetness in washed coffees, and in experimental fermentations, it tends to emphasize acidity and brightness a little too much for my liking. This is where the balance of either Comandante shines in my opinion. Unsurprisingly, this is a niche grinder for niche uses. So if you only want one grinder that will shine with any bean, I still give the upper hand to either Comandante grinder or similar profile grinders. 

**Conclusion**

So in conclusion, unexpectedly, the C60 has become my favorite one of the bunch and the one I take with me anywhere with little concern about damaging it. Any coffee, regardless of roast, setting, or method, will be delicious and balanced. For cuppings, it is unbeatable (these also go for the C40). Earlier, I mentioned I gifted my C40 to my dad. This is because it’s so similar to my C60 that it really made no sense keeping both, and I decided to keep the C60 over it just because of the added durability, build quality, and finer adjustment. All of them are great grinders; however, the Comandantes are just more versatile and durable. I still think the ZP6 is worth it, but it’s just a little too specialized for everyday use and not built strongly enough for my particular use case. I’m sorry this was so long, but there were so many questions in the last post that I decided to be as thorough as I could, but if you have any other questions, please feel free to @ me, and Ill try to answer them as best as I can.

**TLDR**

**C40 Grinder**

	•	**Pros**: Consistent particle distribution, lightweight, easy to travel with, great tactile experience and build quality.

	•	**Performance**: Provides a balanced cup across all coffee types; very consistent between grind settings with about 14% fines.

	•	**Cons**: Veneer can be easily damaged but is protectable with a travel case.

	•	**Overall**: Highly recommended as a versatile and reliable grinder.



**C60 Grinder**

	•	**Pros**: Durable (survived drops), finer adjustment capabilities with goldclix, and consistent performance matching the C40.

	•	**Performance**: Similar cup quality to C40, slightly higher fines at 15%. Handles higher bean throughput but requires more strength to grind.

	•	**Cons**: Heavy and awkward adjustment knob that can cause cuts.

	•	**Overall**: Preferred for its durability and finer adjustments despite being pricier, making it suitable for frequent travel and varied settings.



**ZP6 Grinder**

	•	**Pros**: Excellent for clarity, particularly with natural coffees and experimental fermentations.

	•	**Performance**: Best for pour-overs, with consistent fines around 12% in this range; however, performance varies outside this range.

	•	**Cons**: Not durable, prone to damage from falls. Adjustment ring dented and jammed following an earthquake.

	•	**Overall**: More specialized, recommended for specific coffee types rather than a general-use grinder.



**Conclusion**

	•	The C60 has become my favorite for its robustness, quality, and versatility. Both Comandantes are recommended for their reliability across various settings, while the ZP6, though excellent in specific scenarios, may not be as suitable for general use due to its fragility and specialized performance.

I am an amateur writer and about to take another stab at writing a novel. It's been a tough year for me personally, and I decided that this book should include all the things which make me happy, which comes down to cats, calligraphy, and coffee.

I am only in the planning stages, so I don't know much more than that. It will be a cozy, low stakes mystery, because as I said, it's been a hell of a year, and I just want to write the type of thing I'd want to read at this time in my life. So no murder. It'll be more like an antique calligraphy set goes missing, or someone's prize winning cat disappears. Whatever it is, it has to relate to my three c's (cats, calligraphy, coffee). I will also set it in Monterey because I love that foggy little town, it's very atmospheric.

Over the last few months, I've lurked in this sub and occasionally responded, but mostly kept quiet. I stopped practicing my calligraphy and got pretty insecure, so just want to first of all thank you to everyone who shares their work! I look at all of it and give it a thumbs up, and it motivated me to get back to my practice!

As I research for my book, I thought I'd ask you all if there's anything about calligraphy you'd love to share. This can be historical fact or something personal. Someone on here shared about a beautiful fountain pen they discovered at a market, which began their journey of calligraphy and overcoming a lifelong struggle with handwriting. So it can be something personal or something really cool you learned that you would love to share. I saw the resource list of books earlier and I've been poking around in that.

I'm just looking for inspiration right now and to learn more about calligraphers and what brings people here. I am attaching a photo of some calligraphy practice I did years ago, so you can see that I really do practice this (not that I was expecting a quiz lol). My recent practice has not been this good, and I really am trying to get back into it.

Thank you so much!

He broke off with the only girlfriend he’s ever had like 7 months ago, they were together for 3 years and was the reason why he wouldn’t come to the hangouts, plus he lives the most far away from us.
Almost two months ago we started talking more frequently until we arranged to go out just the two of us (again, nobody in the discord new him irl besides a chilhood friend), so we go out and turns out we have amazing chemistry.
Started going out almost every weekend until we get together with the whole group (guy friends he knew for years but never irl), that night he was like glued to me, never left my side and if we got all on a circle he’d move to be beside me, even if he was left out of it, he drank from my cup the whole night, etc.

From there we kept going out all except one weekend, everytime the outings are going to turistic spots, museums, the cinema, he once took me to an arcade cause he said he wanted to beat me in all of them, etc. Always alone but he tends to comment that a guy friend in particular should’ve come for x reason (although neither he or I invite him, never, we keep planning solo outings).

Every time we meet he brings me some kind of trinket (literally a trinket, today he brought me like a screw cap from an ac he and his dad installed this week, other times he brought me like brochure things of those that they hand you on the street but because they had my name on it, and so on), a few days ago we were talking about the clay things that I make and he asked me if I could make something for him but later told me no cause it was a gift he wanted to get me and realized I would be making my own gift.
When I smile at him he immediately smiles back. 
He talks to me every single day, with even the most silly excuses just to talk for a few minutes. Tells me I should post more photos of me, compliments my tattoos, asks me for advice on hair or clothes.
We watch movies almost every single day too, the rest of our friends stop logging on when there’s only us on the channel because they “don’t want to bother us”. 

Thing is today we went out for like six hours to go to museums and stuff and when we’ve ended the tour and was nighttime we went to grab a seat and he told me he should get going cause he had a long trip to his house, though he said that he just sat there, either in silence or asking me random things, like he didn’t wanted to leave. I asked him if the next time we meet was going to be already his birthday (his birthday is in two weeks and I’ve been making him a cloak his favorite character from his favorite book series wears, from scratch, so I’m pretty excited for that) and he told me ‘no, next week actually’ and I was like are you sure? and he saw the date, smiled and said ‘yeah, do you want to go out next week?’ and I told him of course. Then asked me if I wanted to grab a last coffee, and when we were waiting for it he says: I feel a bit awkward reposting the story you tagged me in today cause we’ve been going out every weekend and people will think you are my girlfriend. ??? (girlfriend instead of ‘dating’ is oddly specific)

I asked him why he care and he was like it’s an availability thing, idk (he was very shy about it) but it got me really confused because literally the last time we went out he told me that I should tag him so I’d save him the job of taking pictures of the outings since he sucked taking photos and I had a good eye (he reposted every single one).

According to a few friends since he only had one girlfriend and he’s very antisocial and shy he’s a bit scared of dating again and more knowing his ex still follows him (they broke up in good terms) so he’s either scared of what she may think or he wanted to seem like he’s talking to more girls? I really don’t know what to think. My best friend tells me he’s obviously interested because you don’t hang out with a female friend every weekend, even more when you have take an hour to get here and even more knowing he wants to gift me little things. Plus she thinks maybe as I’m older he thinks he’s out of my league maybe?
I can’t ask him because I’m scared that in the worst case scenario he’s like this to me purely platonically and I’m the one mixing things up so he’ll stop talking to me if I confess my feelings. What do you think?",1,1731954141.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Over the past century humanity has been through the first, second and third waves of feminism, the internet, online dating, then dating apps, the pill culture, now dating apps are dying, now singers and celebrities with a female audience dominate media (Taylor Swift) and promote a sort of esoteric female independence that really does not want, let alone need, any male influence now. ""Alpha males"" and PUAs are now parodied, everyone is now aware of all the tenets of dating and relationships. It feels like we are getting closer to the culmination of history's progress with the relations between men and women.

With this it all feels collectively that women have been through all the motions and have had all the relationships - some casual, some long-term. The average western woman has seen it all. Good men, bad men, men who didn't turn her on, men who did and then treated her badly, or she got bored, or something else, and now by the time she's around 30-32 she's now voluntarily single, and very independent (nothing wrong with that at all, just observations). Women are just as happy going on coffee dates with their besties, I'm also seeing a lot of young girls out with their PARENTS - it's not un-cool or unfashionable anymore to involve your parents in things. And not to mention people feel tired in general with the effort and energy involved in managing relationships.

Then you have the whole 4B thing which I know is mostly hyperbole, but there is some truth to it in that a lot of women really just don't date anymore, for all sorts of reasons. They've been there, done that. What do you think?

Your desire to transition out of the service industry and into healthcare or office work is completely valid, especially given your academic background and experiences. Here are some suggestions based on your situation:

1. **Language Skills and Local Demographics** In areas like Austin, being bilingual, particularly in Spanish, can be a significant advantage due to the local demographic makeup. If you don’t speak Spanish, consider noting any other languages you do speak, such as German or Russian, as they might still be valuable in specialized roles.
2. **Volunteer Work and Soft Skills** Highlight your volunteer experience on your resume. Hundreds of hours of hospital and mutual aid work demonstrate commitment and initiative. Pair this with soft skills like communication, teamwork, and organization, which are essential in healthcare and office settings.
3. **Target Entry Points in Healthcare** Some entry-level healthcare positions, such as mental health technicians or patient care assistants, often value empathy and resilience over direct experience. If you face rejection, ask for feedback and adjust your applications. Your academic background in biology may also qualify you for lab assistant roles or research-related positions.
4. **Gain Relevant Certifications** Consider obtaining certifications like a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) or Basic Life Support (BLS). These are often quick to achieve and can help you stand out in applications.
5. **Develop Remote Skills** Learning remote-friendly skills, such as basic data analysis, medical billing, or even training in large language models (LLMs), could open new doors. Roles in healthcare tech or administrative support often allow for remote work.

**My Experience**  
I transitioned from a non-tech background to working with AI and multimodal models. The path wasn’t traditional—I’m self-taught and built skills over a decade. While that time investment may sound daunting, the tools available now make learning faster than ever.

If healthcare tech interests you, consider exploring opportunities like annotating AI data for medical applications. This work is 100% remote, pays decently (starting around $35/hour), and doesn't require prior coding knowledge. Passing qualification exams is usually the main barrier, but they are open-book and accessible for someone with college experience.

**Final Thoughts**  
Life has its struggles, but you sound resilient and determined. Keep leveraging your experiences and building your skills, and you’ll create opportunities that align with your goals. Good luck—you’ve got this!



Racist Version:



Do you speak Spanish fluently? Because that is a requirement at a lot of positions in Austin. Austin is 1/3 La-Tinx, I don't like that term, neither do my hispanic friends, but I was about to type hispanic but then my white guilt stopped me so I reverted to the PC term Latinx and then I thought about how the homeless marine I let live with me that ended up getting murdered by my girlfriend would just pronounce it La-Tinx which made it funny because he was Chicano. That is the word he used. I just don't want to be banned by reddit, it is so hard to not be banned it seems, which is why I use LLMs to filter my responses. Anyway you need to know Spanish for a lot of positions. Why? Because 1/3 of Austin is at least familiar with some Spanish and has that qualification.

I don't speak Spanish. I speak German and Russian. I was just told the previous by a person when I tried to get a job selling cell phones off Riverside.

I was just trying to answer why you might not be receiving a call back. Who knows, maybe you know Spanish, this is just me trying to problem solve.

I make jokes in the marine's style because I am using AI to resurrect him. Long story in last post.

I am just saying that there are a lot of people with the Spanish qualification which places them ahead of non-Spanish speakers. I am trying to learn Spanish and can say a few words but get lost when real speakers start a dialog, thus I do not have that qualification.

Another reason might be lack of experience and youth. You might not have the same job record as what they require. Some jobs are ""old man jobs"" for instance like art directors and such because it takes that long to get good at it. That is why some jobs have to pay more. Like brain surgeons. They are in school until their 30s so due to supply and demand their labor is more valuable. Which is why I started learning AI over a decade ago and why now I can get a 100% remote job that pays $35 an hour from any tech company that works with large language models, all of them, because of the work experience I have, which took over a decade to amass.

I did all of that for free. My degree is in history. Which in my opinion is a great degree for the type of work I do now. I type a lot. I type very quickly. I can type in SEO speak as well because before I worked developing large language models I worked developing search engines.

I taught myself all of these skills after undergrad from self study. Undergrad was just the beginning of learning critical thinking skills and how to read and write. I studied for the LSAT and did well but not well enough to get a scholarship so I did not pursue my original intention. Instead I focused on programming and artificial intelligence, more specifically machine learning and natural language processing, linguistics and what evolved into large language models from applications of earlier machine learning libraries.

Thus I can get a desk job any time any where. As long as I have a computer I have a source of income. I don't even need the internet anymore since I know how to locally host LLMs if I wanted to.

But it took a lot of studying over a long period of time. Like over a decade. School probably would have sped that up, but I could not afford to go to school so I am a self taught programmer.

Honestly I think that most of the tech jobs in Austin that people have are like 1099 jobs or independently contracting out tech skills to other businesses. I used to live in AirBNBs and live off UpWork income like a bunch of people I know and I may or may not have uncovered a Russian crime syndicate being followed by the FBI because the guy that owned the house was from a country Trump banned last time. It was hilarious.

I would look into working at hospitals as a tech. There is a high turnover rate for mental hospital techs for instance and Austin has a bunch of those jobs which have plenty of hours and pay well.

You want to be physically intimidating to be a mental hospital tech though, because otherwise you are just going to have to get one of the ones that is to help you inject someone with Haldol. Just saying, that might be why a person might not get that position, because physically intimidating people are better suited for the job. That is not 100% true though. I knew a lot of smaller less physically intimidating people who were successful techs by being kind and empathetic. They were usually older though and had a lot of experience.

But yeah at a mental hospital sometimes the techs have to hold down patients to inject them. I saw it happen all the time. One time this guy was like the size of a football player and it took 6 shots to get him to calm down and every single person that worked there, except the smaller less physically intimidating techs, was helping to hold him down because he was that big, strong and insanely angry. Why was he angry? He was always angry. I never saw him not being angry.

I know where anger comes from. So I don't blame people for being angry. But if you have not hardened yourself to it it can be difficult to stomach. Things like prison or the military when you are around a bunch of people crowded together and being told what to do all the time will also harden you to things like that. I was in neither of those things, but I was homeless which in my opinion is it's own kind of hell. Just different circles of hell. Violence, when it is perpetrated against you without justice will eventually harden you to violence and make you capable of committing it yourself. Why? Because you are forced to. You are forced to be violent in some way.

I did not choose to be the victim of violence and yet I was. I had to get out of the victim's mentality though, which took a lot of effort.

Once I did though I gained so much more power. I have a different perspective on life now. I don't covet material things. I covet things like friendship and resurrecting my dead friend so that my ex girlfriend does not get the death penalty.

But you sound smart and capable enough to do my current job which is 100% remote, requires no coding knowledge, pays $35 an hour. You could just do your job from home or the coffee shop. The only requirements are to first have your application approved, you sound educated and employed enough to qualify, then you just have to pass qualification exams, which are open book, you have college experience so you would do well since it is easier than what you did in undergrad.

It is my favorite form of employment. Well my current job is on multimodal models instead of language which I prefer but most of the available work is just large language models so there is plenty of work available which pays well.

What is more is that if you use LLMs to teach yourself programming, like I did, you can get even higher paying jobs by helping to train the coding aspect of LLMs which is where the real money is.

TLDR: People dislike LLMs but my comments which often get me banned get sanitized so well. Which do you prefer? I wrote the racist version to remember my dead marine friend by keeping his sense of humor. I don't agree with his sense of humor as I am more liberal than him and thus have friends from international backgrounds, etc, and I like foreign people, unlike him, anyway I write in his style so that I can resurrect him.

Real TLDR: Learn machine learning skills to augment your background and you will have an advantage over everyone else. There is so much money being invested in it and the validation process of creating LLMs requires human annotators in order to work so you could just be one of those annotators like me. There are biology centered jobs in LLM annotation. Honestly medical applications of LLMs, like helping blind people with augmented reality glasses be aware of their surroundings, etc, are what makes you feel less evil about contributing to the same technology that enables the advanced signals intelligence necessary to run Iron Dome etc.

Also it is not really a racist version, I just said that to be funny like my dead friend.",1,1731954018.0,u_KonradFreeman,0,1.0,False

Looking for a long-lasting lip color that won't let you down? I recently tried the COVERGIRL Outlast Lipstain in the shade Sugey Girl, and I was impressed by its staying power.

This vegan lipstain glides on smoothly with its pen-like tip, making it easy to apply with precision. I found the color to be buildable, allowing me to create a subtle tint or a more intense look. The satin finish gives a nice sheen without feeling sticky or heavy on the lips.

https://preview.redd.it/40nh6yt6bp1e1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf477ded3aec1e1901d2d0c194feacaf1b4d7d5d

One thing I really liked was how lightweight it felt throughout the day. Unlike some long-wearing lip products, this one didn't dry out my lips or feel tight. The transfer-proof formula lived up to its claims, staying put even after eating and drinking.

The plant-based acacia tree extract in the formula seems to help keep lips feeling fresh. With 14 shades to choose from, there's likely a color for everyone's taste.

# Bottom Line

If you want a lip color that lasts without the usual drawbacks of long-wearing formulas, give the COVERGIRL Outlast Lipstain a try. Its easy application and comfortable wear make it a solid choice for everyday use.



# Overview of COVERGIRL Outlast Lipstain

I recently tried the Outlast Lipstain from COVERGIRL. This vegan formula glides on smoothly with its pen-like tip. The color builds up nicely, giving a satin stained finish. I found it to be very lightweight - it feels like I'm wearing nothing at all. The stain lasts for hours without transferring, which is great. It's easy to apply precisely thanks to the applicator.

While the color range is good with 14 shades, some might find it limited. The stain can be a bit drying over time, so using a lip balm underneath helps. It's not as long-lasting as some other lip stains I've tried, but it still performs well for most of the day.

• Vegan formula • Lightweight feel • Transfer-proof • Precise application • 14 color options

# The Convenience of a Pen-Like Applicator

I love how easy it is to apply this lip stain. The pen-like tip makes it super simple to get a precise look. I can draw clean lines and fill in my lips without any mess. It's way easier than using a traditional lipstick or gloss wand. The slim design fits nicely in my makeup bag too. I found I could quickly touch up my color during the day without needing a mirror. The applicator lets me build up the color gradually for a natural or bold look. It's great for on-the-go use. The only downside is you can't see how much product is left inside.

# Satin Stained Finish for a Classy Touch

I love how this lip stain gives my lips a classy look. The satin finish is not too shiny or matte, but just right. It feels smooth on my lips and doesn't dry them out. The color builds up nicely, so I can go light for day or darker for night. It stays put for hours without feeling heavy. I don't have to worry about it coming off on my coffee cup or when I eat. The pen tip makes it easy to apply precisely. It's great for busy days when I need my makeup to last.

# Long-Lasting, Transfer-Proof Color

I was really impressed with how long this lip stain lasted. I put it on in the morning and it stayed put all day, even through meals and drinks. The color didn't budge or transfer onto my coffee cup. It felt light on my lips, not heavy or sticky like some long-wear lipsticks. The satin finish looked natural and didn't dry out my lips. By evening, the color had faded a bit but still looked good. I didn't need to reapply or touch up at all. For me, this beats having to check and fix my lipstick constantly. The staying power is definitely a big plus of this Outlast lip stain.

# Vegan Formula: Kind to Your Lips and the Planet

I love that this lip stain is vegan. It's great for people who care about animals and the environment. The formula contains plant-based acacia tree extract instead of animal products. This makes it feel good on my lips and aligns with my values. The vegan makeup is also cruelty-free, so it's not tested on animals. I noticed the stain feels lightweight and non-drying throughout the day. It's nice to wear makeup that's both effective and ethical. The vegan formula doesn't sacrifice quality or performance. My lips look great, and I feel good about using a product that's kinder to the planet.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this COVERGIRL lip stain for a while now, and I have some thoughts to share. Let's break down what I like and don't like about it.

# Pros

* The pen-like tip makes it easy to apply. I can draw precise lines and fill in my lips without much effort.
* It lasts for hours. I don't need to reapply often, even after eating or drinking.
* The color builds up nicely. I can go for a subtle tint or layer it for a bolder look.
* It feels very light on my lips. I often forget I'm wearing it.
* The vegan formula is a big plus for me. I like that it's cruelty-free and uses plant-based ingredients.

# Cons

* It can be a bit drying. My lips sometimes feel parched after wearing it all day.
* The color range is limited. I wish there were more shades to choose from.
* It's not as long-lasting as some other lip stains I've tried. It fades faster than I'd like.
* The pen design, while precise, can take longer to apply than a traditional lipstick.
* Some colors look different on the lips than in the packaging. This can be frustrating when shopping online.

I find this lip stain to be a good option for everyday wear. It's not perfect, but it does the job well enough. The ease of use and lightweight feel are big pluses for me. But the drying effect and limited color range hold it back from being my go-to lip product.

# Customer Reviews

I've spent some time reading through user feedback on the Covergirl Outlast lipstain. Many buyers seem pleased with its long-lasting power and smooth application. The pen-like tip gets praise for precise lines. Some users love how it doesn't smudge or feather.

Not everyone is a fan, though. A few reviewers found the colors brighter or darker than expected. Some felt it took extra product to get full coverage. Dryness was mentioned as a downside, but adding lip balm helped.

Most agree it stays put through eating and drinking. The vegan formula and nice scent are positives for some. Overall, opinions are mixed but lean positive. It seems to work well for many as a base layer or liner. Your mileage may vary based on skin tone and color choice.

# Conclusion

After trying this COVERGIRL lip stain, I'm impressed with its performance. The pen-like applicator makes it easy to control and create precise lines. It dries quickly and doesn't smudge or transfer. The color stays put for hours, even through eating and drinking. While it can feel a bit drying, a lip balm on top solves that issue. The shade range is nice, though some colors may look brighter on than expected. For its price, this lip stain offers good value. It's a solid choice for those wanting long-lasting lip color without constant touch-ups. Just be sure to check swatches to find your perfect shade.",1,1731953599.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False
