First Impressions:

I used the Java Burn supplement for a month, incorporating it into my daily routine alongside my regular coffee intake. The packaging exuded a sense of sophistication, with a sleek design and promises of increased energy and fat-burning benefits. The instructions were clear, recommending one sachet per day, preferably in the morning.

Flavor and Preparation:

Upon tearing open the sachet, I was greeted by a pleasant aroma reminiscent of freshly ground coffee beans. Java Burn blended seamlessly with my usual coffee, imparting a mild, nutty undertone without overpowering the rich coffee flavor. The convenience of a pre-measured sachet made preparation a breeze, making it a practical addition to my busy mornings.

Energy Boost:

One of the standout features of Java Burn was its promised energy boost. I noticed a gradual increase in alertness and sustained energy throughout the day.

Metabolism and Weight Management:

The primary claim of Java Burn revolves around its ability to enhance metabolism and aid in weight management. While I cannot attribute all my weight-related changes solely to this supplement, I did observe a subtle decrease in my overall appetite. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Java Burn seemed to contribute positively to my weight management efforts.

Ingredients and Transparency:

Examining the ingredient list revealed a blend of familiar components such as green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and various antioxidants. Java Burn prides itself on its natural and plant-based composition, appealing to those conscious of their dietary choices. The transparency in listing the ingredients added a layer of trust to the overall product experience.

Taste Preferences and Customization:

Java Burn acknowledges that taste preferences vary, and they encourage users to experiment with different beverage choices for customization. I appreciated this approach, as it allowed me to tailor the supplement to suit my personal taste preferences. Whether mixed with black coffee or a smoothie, Java Burn seamlessly integrated into my daily routine.

 Java Burn Review You have to try this one Review

First Impressions:

I used the Java Burn supplement for a month, incorporating it into my daily routine alongside my regular coffee intake. The packaging exuded a sense of sophistication, with a sleek design and promises of increased energy and fat-burning benefits. The instructions were clear, recommending one sachet per day, preferably in the morning.

Flavor and Preparation:

Upon tearing open the sachet, I was greeted by a pleasant aroma reminiscent of freshly ground coffee beans. Java Burn blended seamlessly with my usual coffee, imparting a mild, nutty undertone without overpowering the rich coffee flavor. The convenience of a pre-measured sachet made preparation a breeze, making it a practical addition to my busy mornings.

Energy Boost:

One of the standout features of Java Burn was its promised energy boost. I noticed a gradual increase in alertness and sustained energy throughout the day. Unlike the jittery feeling associated with some caffeine supplements, Java Burn provided a smoother and more prolonged energy release, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a steady pick-me-up.

Metabolism and Weight Management:

The primary claim of Java Burn revolves around its ability to enhance metabolism and aid in weight management. While I cannot attribute all my weight-related changes solely to this supplement, I did observe a subtle decrease in my overall appetite. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Java Burn seemed to contribute positively to my weight management efforts.

Ingredients and Transparency:

Examining the ingredient list revealed a blend of familiar components such as green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and various antioxidants. Java Burn prides itself on its natural and plant-based composition, appealing to those conscious of their dietary choices. The transparency in listing the ingredients added a layer of trust to the overall product experience.

Taste Preferences and Customization:

Java Burn acknowledges that taste preferences vary, and they encourage users to experiment with different beverage choices for customization. I appreciated this approach, as it allowed me to tailor the supplement to suit my personal taste preferences. Whether mixed with black coffee or a smoothie, Java Burn seamlessly integrated into my daily routine.

We’ve never argued, but I’m facing a recurring issue with her flakiness, which has been especially tough to deal with as I navigate the loss of my mom three months ago.

My friend was my main support during the initial weeks after my mom’s passing; she knew her well and was there for the funeral and much more. She had a vacation booked in advance a few weeks later but she checked in a lot via text, which I appreciated. I told her I was doing okay, but once she returned, I hoped for some hangouts and time together.

She immediately got swept back into her busy 9-5 routine. I reached out to grab a quick coffee that first week back, but she keeps saying she’s too busy and that we’ll reschedule for next week. When that week comes, it’s the same story. She mentions being overwhelmed with plans from other friends and her boyfriend, yet I can’t help but wonder—does she not remember I asked first?

Her other friends are quite different from me and I do wonder if they fit her interests and personality more than I do? I know she’s a genuinely good person and wouldn’t intentionally avoid me; I think she just feels flustered trying to juggle everything. However, as we transition into adulthood, our lives are just going to get busier. I’m a full-time student in the most difficult year of my degree; yet I still make the effort to see the people I care about.

This situation has made me wonder where her priorities lie as if I had a friend going through a loss like this, I’d want to see her in person, regardless of how she said she was doing. If it weren’t for my other friends, I’d feel completely lonely navigating this loss.

I’m considering not texting her at all to see if she makes an effort to reach out.

1giggtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1giggtf/is_my_best_friend_too_busy_for_me_or_are_we/,Is my best friend too busy for me or are we drifting apart? ,"I’m (21F), and my best friend (21F) and I have been close since we were 10. We’ve never argued, but I’m facing a recurring issue with her flakiness, which has been especially tough to deal with as I navigate the loss of my mom three months ago.

My friend was my main support during the initial weeks after my mom’s passing; she knew her well and was there for the funeral and much more. She had a vacation booked in advance a few weeks later but she checked in a lot via text, which I appreciated. I told her I was doing okay, but once she returned, I hoped for some hangouts and time together.

She immediately got swept back into her busy 9-5 routine. I reached out to grab a quick coffee that first week back, but she keeps saying she’s too busy and that we’ll reschedule for next week. When that week comes, it’s the same story. She mentions being overwhelmed with plans from other friends and her boyfriend, yet I can’t help but wonder—does she not remember I asked first?

Her other friends are quite different from me and I do wonder if they fit her interests and personality more than I do? I know she’s a genuinely good person and wouldn’t intentionally avoid me; I think she just feels flustered trying to juggle everything. However, as we transition into adulthood, our lives are just going to get busier. I’m a full-time student in the most difficult year of my degree; yet I still make the effort to see the people I care about.

This situation has made me wonder where her priorities lie as if I had a friend going through a loss like this, I’d want to see her in person, regardless of how she said she was doing. If it weren’t for my other friends, I’d feel completely lonely navigating this loss.

I’m considering not texting her at all to see if she makes an effort to reach out. I don’t want to come off as needy or guilt her, but I’m torn between talking to her about how I feel and accepting that we might be drifting apart as I really care about her.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of internet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,

We’ve never argued, but I’m facing a recurring issue with her flakiness, which has been especially tough to deal with as I navigate the loss of my mom three months ago. 

My friend was my main support during the initial weeks after my mom’s passing; she knew her well and was there for the funeral and much more. She had a vacation booked in advance a few weeks later but she checked in a lot via text, which I appreciated. I told her I was doing okay, but once she returned, I hoped for some hangouts and time together.

She immediately got swept back into her busy 9-5 routine. I reached out to grab a quick coffee that first week back, but she keeps saying she’s too busy and that we’ll reschedule for next week. When that week comes, it’s the same story. She mentions being overwhelmed with plans from other friends and her boyfriend, yet I can’t help but wonder—does she not remember I asked first?

Her other friends are quite different from me and I do wonder if they fit her interests and personality more than I do? I know she’s a genuinely good person and wouldn’t intentionally avoid me; I think she just feels flustered trying to juggle everything. However, as we transition into adulthood, our lives are just going to get busier. I’m a full-time student in the most difficult year of my degree; yet I still make the effort to see the people I care about.

This situation has made me wonder where her priorities lie as if I had a friend going through a loss like this, I’d want to see her in person, regardless of how she said she was doing. If it weren’t for my other friends, I’d feel completely lonely navigating this loss.

I’m considering not texting her at all to see if she makes an effort to reach out. I don’t want to come off as needy or guilt her, but I’m torn between talking to her about how I feel and accepting that we might be drifting apart as I really care about her. Has anyone been through something like this?

TLDR: My best friend (21F) was supportive after my mom passed away, but now she seems distant and too busy with her 9-5 and other friends to make plans. I'm contemplating not texting her to see if she reaches out first. Advice?",1,1730613485.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I ate a bit too much for dinner at home (pizza) then went out to a coffee shop with my bf around 3 hours later. I was still feeling stuffed but my boyfriend got pasta with alfredo sauce and garlic bread and it looked so good so I had a few bites. I was also super thirsty so I downed a glass of cold water very fast and at the same time I was also drinking a hot latte. Big mistake.

I started feeling awful very fast and felt like my stomach was filled with air. It felt like I had to burp but it wouldn’t come out and the feeling got worse and worse. I got up to try to walk a bit and it hit me so hard I ran out of the restaurant and was sure I was going to tu*. I tried to walk to the gas station to buy some mints as that usually helps me but as I began walking it got even worse, my stomach was hurting so much, I felt horrible and then I got the taste in the back of my throat. I was also is horrible panic mode and couldn’t even walk anymore so I sat outside on the sidewalk in the cold with no jacket on because of how fast I ran out :( I kept thinking that’s it, it’s going to happen, there’s no way out this time…

Waking up feels like someone jolts you awake at 3 a.m. in the most chaotic manner. The panic, stress, and, above all, fatigue persist throughout the day. Everything you do, you do because it's your normal routine: making coffee, showering, having breakfast—you do it, but it means nothing. It's as if everything that normally gives you energy is now the “zero” version, doing nothing but giving you a taste of what you used to have.

People around you try to show compassion. But I know how I would have reacted to something like this: “overly dramatic nonsense, get a grip and move on!” But it sometimes feels like they think you have control over it. As if a rich man chooses to put all his money in savings and live as a poor man to learn something. And when it's inconvenient or badly timed, they still expect you to withdraw some of those savings. But your savings are already deep in the red. My savings vault is filled with cobwebs and echoes.

I can't explain the overwhelming fatigue you feel from a simple walk. Or the unpredictability of energy levels day by day. One day, you can manage a walk around the block; the next day, that same walk feels impossible. Or you return from it with chest pain, unable to catch your breath. Or the sudden collapse of your energy, which comes without warning, while you're on the toilet or calmly watching something on the couch. The fatigue that makes you want to collapse on the spot and turn everything off and disappear. Which, I can tell you from experience, does nothing good for your mood.

The panic and stress from the simplest things that you wouldn't have blinked at before. In-laws/relatives suddenly visiting. When sudden grocery shopping needs to be done. Where I used to be stoic and not worry about things beyond my control, now I'm thrown off by almost everything. And the sudden headaches that come with it, again completely unannounced. A stabbing, lingering pain that sometimes festers in the background for days. As if a clamp is constantly pinching a thin piece of your skin.

My immune system seems non-existent. If someone enters our house with a cold, you can bet I'll be sick a few days later. Fever, flu-like symptoms, sore throat, etc. I have headaches almost every day. But honestly, a “normal” illness feels good because then I feel the natural process of my body healing from something.

When this started, there were three of us: my wife, our daughter Mesi, and me. Before long COVID, my wife and I agreed that when Mesi turned 2, we would try for a second child. The fear of having a baby in my current state was daunting. But staying positive as we were: “nine months is a long time, things will be better by then, right? You take care of Mesi, and I'll handle the baby if it gets really bad!”

Our second child arrived healthy and well, and we are so happy with her. But during the pregnancy, my job decided not to extend my contract to a permanent one and fired me for two reasons based on lies. And when I disproved those reasons with evidence, I was told it no longer mattered. In other words, it was likely due to my illness. Additionally, my wife lost her father on the same day our Nori was born. And not just any father, but a wonderful grandfather to Mesi and a genuinely fine and honest man.

The days now sometimes feel endless. I adore my children and love them more than I could ever love anything else. But I can't call myself a good father right now. I'm impatient, physically and often mentally absent. I expect my oldest to have the mental resilience of a 30-year-old. The weak excuse that I put all my energy into them doesn't ease my mind either. Because the energy is laughable at best. My wife, who has to accept that our second child’s birthday will always be on her father's death anniversary, isn't in the best place mentally either. Fortunately, there is medication and a prognosis for her. I hope things will get better for her soon.

Since October 15, 2022, something has taken over me that controls my entire being. I navigate my body like a co-pilot, seeing everything but not always able to steer everything correctly.
I’m a 32 year old male.

I'm looking to buy my first espresso machine and would love some advice from this community. A bit about me: I'm in Italy and getting into espresso-making (my grandparents even had a professional machine in their shop, so I’ve grown up around coffee culture). I don’t have much countertop space, so I'm looking for a compact option. I’ll buy a grinder later—luckily, I have a great local roaster just around the corner.

We’re a household of two, and we mostly enjoy espresso and cappuccinos. For longer brews, we already have a selection of filter options.

What I’m looking for:

Heating time: Faster is better! Most specs don’t seem to mention heating times, but it’s a priority for me.

Quiet operation: I’d love to wake my partner with the smell of coffee, not the machine’s noise.

Pressure: I’m curious about different pump pressures (e.g., 9 vs. 15 or even 20 bars) and what they mean for quality and consistency.


So far, I’m considering:

Gaggia (maybe the Espresso Evolution) – It’s quite affordable.

Sage the Bambino Plus – I’ve read it has a very quick heating time, which is appealing.

Lelit Anna or Victoria – I’ve heard good things, especially about build quality.


The Gaggia is about a third of the cost of some other options but seems to have similar specs. I’m wondering if it’s worth going for the pricier machines or if there are any other models that might meet my needs.

Any insights on heating time, noise level, and pressure quality for these machines (or others) would be super helpful. Thanks so much!",1,1730612732.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I have so much regrets that I let you become a part of my life even for a brief moment. Ok na sana you just exists there na hindi ako aware. Ako pa tong tanga na naniwala sa red string theory na yan kasi ilang beses we had a chance to meet back in college, we were classmates and groupmates on one of my subjs pero we never had interactions. Pero months later, you reached out at andami nagbago sa buhay ko. You were the first guy to ever made me feel that I am needed. Turns out gagamitin mo lang pala kasi ako. A lot said we make a good pair. Lahat ng common friends natin and even both our fam were rooting for us. Pero I wasn't sure of your intentions and even with my own feelings. 

We had good times and for a moment I felt like I was able to explore things in life I never thought I'd experience before. You would always invite me and make me feel belonged. I showed you how vulnerable I can be as we both shared to each other our past and even some future plans. I even helped you out to build your career kasi I saw that desire in you to build a future na successful tayo pareho because you would always cheered me up on days that I was doubting myself. I supported you in everything even if it means being inconvenienced, I didn't mind it just so I can help you out. Pero bigla mo nalang ako iniwan dun sa sinimulan natin. You started pulling away, you stopped inviting me for sponty weekend gala or coffee dates just so we can have a break from reality. 

There we suddenly stopped talking and I never reached out again. You even unfriended and softblocked me on socmeds. I feel so wronged. I feel so betrayed. I kept on questioning myself where did we go wrong? Or did I ever do anything wrong to you because all I did was to do you favors. And on a random night you started posting a girl and there I realized tama pala ko. A girl's instinct never disappoints talaga. Sa ilang bwan na yun na tayo lagi magkasama, nasaan sya nun? Ganon ba talaga ko kahirap piliin? We had random encounters after the ghosting and what's funny e we went straight back to just being strangers. You can't even laid your eyes on me. Because of guilt? I hope so. 

But I already accepted it how you left me hanging and back to being alone. I'm still happy for you that you already found someone after being cheated on in the past. Hindi naman na big deal masyado sakin yung what we could have been and I am not the type of person naman to hold grudges pero alam mo what hurts me the most? You were so ungrateful.

I've experienced anhedonia and depression in varying degrees throughout the years, and I've noticed that I feel much better during later hours of fasting. For instance, I start my fast at 6 PM and don't eat until about 12 PM following day, and I feel mentally well and I feel my brain is primed to enjoy things so much easier from when I wake up around 7 - 8 AM until the time I break my fast. Once I break my fast, I experience a low level of anhedonia and brain-fog that gradually gets worse as the day goes, especially after the second meal of the day.

I do have mild insulin resistance that's continuing to improve through losing weight and exercising, but I think it's not entirely insulin sensitivity that's the issue. I'm thinking it could be linked to food allergy/intolerance.. specifically rice which I consumed on a daily basis.. And another thing I'm thinking are ketones which might be helping with my mood.

I previously did a keto diet on two occasions and felt the depression lift. I honestly didn't know I could feel THAT good. I felt happy and content almost all the time, which was really weird and amusing. I stopped the keto diets previously due to developing heart palpitations after several months. It could've been the coffee I started drinking again toward the end, or it could've been the electrolytes.. or both.

I clearly remember breaking the keto diet with rice and meats and feeling the anhedonia/brain-fog come wash over me. Thinking back and writing this out.. I'm beginning to really think it's either I'm sensitive to carbs, rice, or I just mentally feel better on ketones. Perhaps all three? Oh man I didn't think this post would be this long. My apologies.. I'm just so tired of this mental fog and anhedonia.

I'd love to hear anyone's insights or similar experience.

My plan is to get to my desired weight (15 lbs lighter) then re-assess my mental health. I will also try swapping out rice with other sources of carbs. If all those doesn't do it, then I will implement the keto diet again.",2,1730612355.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

Q1: How large is Ark?  
A: It's about the size of Seoul in South Korea.

Q2: The main food source in Ark is Splendamin, but are coffee and alcoholic drinks also made from Splendamin?  
A: Yes, ingredients made from Splendamin are used for both solid and liquid products.

Q3: What are the ingredients of these ingredients?  
A: That information is confidential. Even the governor in CG doesn’t know the details. Only those in charge of food production and Enikk have access to this information.

Q4: In Ark, animals and plants from the surface are managed by CG. Are facilities for garbage, sewage, and corpses also managed or run by CG or Nikke squads?  
A: Anything other than elements with random components, like animals, plants, or entertainment, is managed by Enikk. All processes that can be automated are handled by Enikk.

Q5: Can humans marry a Nikke in Ark?  
A: It is legal, and there are a small number of cases. However, the outcome is not always a happy ending for everyone involved.

Q6: Are sports in Ark separated into human and Nikke classes?  
A: Yes, they are clearly separated. The strength of humans and Nikkes is vastly different, so the risk of accidents would be very high if they were not separated. Nikke sports events are slightly more popular than those for humans, as Nikkes can perform impressive feats with their strength, creating flashy matches.

Q7: Who are the most famous Nikkes in Ark?  
A: Noise, Volume, and Aria from Prima Donna are among the most famous. Matis is also well-known, but even they cannot compare to Prima Donna. There was a Nikke who was even more famous than Prima Donna in the past.

Q8: In Ark, how much income do you need to live a basic life?  
A: The cost of living a basic life is low in Ark, as you only need Splendamin and water to survive. However, there are many temptations in Ark, so you will need a higher income to fulfill those desires.

Q9: Are Ark Rangers humans or Nikkes?  
A: They are Nikkes. This allows them to perform flashy stunts without CG.

Q10: How many commanders are there in Ark?  
A: The specific number hasn't been determined before. There are not many of them. As the reclamation of the surface has made little progress over the years, the role of commander has become less popular.

1gig308,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gig308/it_found_me/,It found me.,"""Sleep. Just go to sleep. It'll be over in the morning. You can do it. You can sleep it off. Ignore the knocking,"" I tried to keep myself from going completely crazy from the knocking on my window. ""Don't open your eyes,"" I either *thought*, or I *whispered* under my breath. Everything is a blur.

  
Ever since I accepted the job offer, my life's become a living hell. I can't go to the grocery, exercise, or even go to work without ~~feeling~~ ***knowing*** something is following me.



I'll provide some context. Last month, I, Jonathan Michaels, fresh out of college at 22, I applied for a job at a new company, Brighter Days Inc. It was a sort of... well, I don't wanna say *asylum*... it didn't seem like it was *that* serious. Just a mental health facility.

  
I was so excited to pursue my dreams, helping people understand the power of their minds. For brighter days, as the company said.

  
For the first 3 days, I worked as an assistant, helping the other nurses, serving people coffee, things like that. On the 4th day, I was *finally* tasked to serve a patient. I was **nervous**, but more excited, probably.

  
""So, are there any problems you're currently facing?"" I asked the patient before beginning the consultation. I was working as a psychologist, with my own office and everything. She maintained a fairly friendly aura, before she actually started speaking.

  
""No... it's more like... a problem is facing ***me,***"" the patient replied.

  
I was intrigued, not too scared yet. I didn't study 4 years to give up from *that*. ""What exactly *is* this problem*?*"" I asked next.

  
She paused. Then she said, ""It started with a dream."" She paused again. I still remained silent, as she looked to be thinking of a way to speak the next sentence. ""A man. No, wait..."" she struggled, ""A figure. It was a figure. Was it? No, maybe not,"" she retracted every explanation she tried to give, as my curiosity peaked.

  
""An entity,"" she spoke, sounding sure this time. ""It was an entity. A black shadow-like figure. It had a hunched back, glowing white eyes, and dinosaur-like arms and legs, clawed and everything. It was like a breed of a shadow, some *demonic* contorted T-Rex, and a *disturbingly* tall man.""

  
I paused, maybe a *little* nervous this time, but not backing down. ""Ok... and what did he do?"" I asked.

  
""He **stared**. That stare... it haunts me in my dreams. In life. He's everywhere,"" she cried quietly. Whenever my nervousness increased, my curiosity increased 2x more.

  
""He stared?"" I asked, ""When did he start staring? *Why* did he start staring? Did he do anything else?"" I had a million other questions, but I bit my tongue to hear her out.

  
""He lurked around me at times, following me wherever I went. It seemed like he was growing bigger the more scared I grew of him. This is the only place I've ever felt safe. I made a good decision coming here,"" she said.

  
""He started staring around when my husband died. He went missing and was found drowned in a lake a week after. Always screaming that he would kill someone,"" she added, ""And I don't know *why* the **entity** started coming after *me*.""

  
I paused for a while, trying to collect my rushing thoughts. ""Alright. When was the last time you saw this entity?"" I asked.

  
""He chased me here, but I never saw him again since being here. It's been about a week,"" she replied.

  
""Ok, Alice, I need you to know that you're safe here. That he *won't* hurt you, ok?"" I spoke.

  
""I know,"" she said, eerily. I always wondered what it meant. For someone who had been so scared speaking of it, ""I know"" seemed like a weird thing to reply.

  
The rest of the days, she spoke about how she misses her kids, mother, and husband. I was always curious about this ""husband"" of hers. I assumed it was a sensitive topic, so I chose to steer clear of it for the time being.

  
About a week after the first incident, she looked scared to see me when I entered her room. ""No! No! I want a different person! Someone else! Someone else, *please*! Not this one!"" she screamed.

  
""Alice, it's me. Johnathan. Remember?"" I spoke softly, trying to comfort her.

  
""I know! That's the problem!"" she shouted.

  
The nurse tried escorting her out, but I told her to let her stay. I was intrigued. ""What's wrong?"" I asked.

  
""I saw it again."" she lowered her voice, as her demeanor changed... more **sinisterly**. Mysterious.

  
""What did it do? Did it attack you?"" I asked her.

  
""No, it doesn't want *me* anymore,"" she replied, before finally looking me in the eyes, almost smirking a little, ""It wants ***you***.""

  
I felt a shiver strike through my spine. ""Me? Why does it want me?"" I asked, still trying to keep it light and maintain my composure.

  
She started **laughing. Like a** ***maniac*****.** It scared me, for the first time since I started working here. Then, she stood up, and left.

  
I had a hard time sleeping that night. I kept hearing whispering, I assumed it was the wind.

  
And then I heard a female voice whisper, ""She told you didn't she?"" I gasped and *jumped* out of bed, my eyes still *wincing* from the rheum that had formed in my eyes. In the wincing state of my eyes, I thought I had seen a figure in the corner of my room, its' head peeking out from the side of the dresser.

  
But when I opened my eyes after rubbing the rheum out, it was gone. That's when it started. With a **dream**, as the woman stated. Upon the following days, I felt like I was being followed ***everywhere***. Alice was discharged within 2 weeks, and I didn't see her for a while after that.

  
The man however, I saw *frequently*. Either from the corner of my eye, or in my dreams. It was just like she had described. A black distorted shadow figure, that just **stared**.

  
I would have rather it attacked me than just stared. That stare was soul-piercing. It's as if every fear I had ever had was morphed into existence in the form of this figure and stared at me with the intensity and passion of a *million* red giants.

  
I took a break from my job, after that. It was too much for me to handle.

  
Until ***it found me***. Three nights ago was the first time I had ever seen it fully, standing in front of my bed, after I woke up in the middle of the night. Only this time, it didn't disappear. It continued staring, and it's as if the figure got *bigger and bigger* the longer it stayed. I couldn't speak to it or form any sentences or words. I just stared, and so did it. After what felt like an hour, my neighbor must have dropped a pan or something, loud enough for me to look away. And when I looked back, the figure was ***gone***.

  
I was told I'd be fired if I took any more sick days from work, so I was *forced* to go back to work the next day. Alice was there, packing the last of the things she had brought from when she stayed here. I ran to her, and she looked shocked.

  
I had eyebags under my eyes, disheveled and wrinkled clothes, and messy hair.

  
I asked her, ""Please help me! Please! Why is it following *me* this time?"" Tears began to well in my eyes.

  
She hugged me, then looked me in the eyes. Tears formed in hers' too. ""I'm sorry. *I had to give it to someone*. ***Like my husband did to me,***"" she spoke, as she wiped the tears from her eyes, hiding a dark smirk across her lips.",1,1730612128.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1gig2s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gig2s5/seeing_mess_asd_help_me_understand/,Seeing mess & ASD - Help me understand,"So I (30F) have been living with my housemate (33F) for a couple of months. She is great and I love her very much. However, there are some things surrounding hygiene and cleanliness that I have been struggling to navigate with her. Some examples:

  
1. When I moved in, the shower was broken, so she said I had to use the bathtub. However, the bathtub was filled with her leg hairs from when she had last shaved, so I had to clean it. This was my first day.

2. When she has her period, she often leaves blood on the toilet seat, on the bowl, in the sink, or has spilled it on multiple bathroom mats - she uses a cup for context, I know bc she leaves it out. I have had to clean this each time.

3. When I arrived, she had fruit in her fruitbowl that was so mouldy it had turned completely blue and fuzzy. She continued to store fruit in the bowl which she would still eat. 3 weeks later I finally mentioned it to her so she cleaned it.

4. Every day she makes coffee and spills coffee grounds or brewed coffee on the floor, which is then tracked around the apartment by her or the dog.

5. A week or so ago she bought some raw chicken for the dog and left it unsealed in the fridge. It started to smell bad after a day or two. I asked one day 'hey, what is that smell?' and she immediately said it was the chicken, so I asked if she would mind putting it into a sealed container. She said yes but forgot. It stayed in the fridge two more days, by which point the smell had gotten so foul it was hard to even use the fridge or be in the kitchen. I asked her if she could please throw it out, so she put it in an unsealed / open air bin in the kitchen, so the entire apartment reeked when I woke up and it took most of the day to get rid of the smell. The fridge still smells terrible but I'm hoping it will dissipate soon.

  
After the chicken incident, I tried to talk to her about household chores and how to navigate some of these issues. I said I felt like as housemates we should both be responsible for our own individual messes (like if we spill something, do a lot of cooking, have food that goes rancid), and then split other domestic labour (doesn't have to be exactly 50/50 or on a timeline, but just both of us doing our best for vaccuuming, daily dishes, mopping etc). 

She kinda pushed back and was saying:

1. She doesn't see the mess so it's impossible for her to be responsible for her own messes. They will only be cleaned on her own timeline (she felt like I was rushing her too much re: the rancid chicken).

2. If I want things to be done faster or to be cleaner, I should do it myself.

I feel kinda uncomfortable about these things because I pay rent. I am happy to do some extra cleaning because I do think I like things a bit tidier than her, so that's okay. But I don't want to have to clean extreme mold, rancid meat, period blood etc. I don't think that's fair. I also don't want to have to wait ages for stuff like that to be cleaned.. the meat in particular was concerning to me because it's dangerous.

When I tried to say this, she got upset and said these things just aren't possible because of her ASD. She also has ADHD and schizophrenia for context, but she seems to think this is mostly ASD. I love her VERY much and she is an amazing friend, and I 100% believe she is doing her best and this is not intentional. But I also sorta believe that even if this is where she's at today, couldn't we keep working on this? She doesn't seem to think it's possible for her to improve in this regard at all.

So, I am wondering, does anyone have some experiences or resources that could help me to better understand my friend or this situation? Is she right and I just have to suck it up and clean these things? How can I navigate these sorts of conversations in a way that is respectful and supportive of her ASD?

And some MORE context: several days ago, she comes up to me saying someone had some complaints about me. “She isn’t doing her dishes right away/ doesn’t wipe down the table right away, etc” well I had hand surgery and had to take it easy on dishes at first, and this is someone I didn’t even know or even spoke to yet that brought up these complaints. Well today I came in early and sat in the office to finish my coffee, then I hear the kitchen lead and the coworker talking bad about me, thinking I hadn’t shown up yet.. saying things like “oh how many breaks did she take, I saw you stayed late did she order you around?, why were some of the order pickup times late?, was she talking shit about anyone? Stuff like that… basically using the coworker as bait to ask about what I’m doing my entire shift then laughing about it while doing it. but let me tell you when she saw me in the office right after, she kept jokingly calling me sneaky, acting like nothing was just said. 

Am I over reacting from the tone of her message then also her talking shit about me to a coworker?? I’m just so hurt because this coworker was pretending to be my friend and instead used anything I talked about to fed it to the kitchen lead. Then denied it when I confronted her..

I feel my time was disrespected and I no longer want prioritize time for us when I visit","I don’t know why I feel guilty for being upset at my friend who convinced me to fly in to my home state for us to hang out, but then flaked on me last minute. I’m okay traveling back home, I mostly take the 10 hrs drive, however this time I decided to fly back to my home state. I travel back very often as my family is here. I was home only a month ago and wasn’t planning to visit until Christmas. I was talking to my friend who I always make it a priority to visit each trip, if I should come back the end of the month for Halloween. I was on the fence about it, leaning more towards not. I wanted to stay home and celebrate Halloween with my kitties. My friend convinced me to fly back home, and we had plans to try this place that’s been on our list for a while or go on a day trip like we normally do. She is a mom and I understand that. I don’t have kids but am very accommodating and have no problem when her kids come along. I even try to find places that’s kids friendly, and make sure her kids are comfortable. Every time we plan to hang out, if she doesn’t have a sitter, we change the plan to find something that’s kid friendly. Which I’m always okay with. 

She knew I was coming in 3 weeks ago, has she is who convinced me to travel in to town. I would ask her 2 weeks prior to, “what do you want to do?” One of our plans were to visit this place on our bucket list, or day trip with the kids. Literally on the day we planned to hang out she told me she doesn’t feel like bringing her kids and there is a time limit on how long we can be out because her sitter has to leave. She asked if we can just go grab coffee. Honestly I felt like my time was disrespected. I mean, yea I don’t have kids and I have the freedom to pick up and travel like that. However didn’t want to come back so soon and I also had other friends who I haven’t seen in a long time, and did not inform them I would be in town. I was making that time out for us because she asked me to come back. While I’m visiting for a week I only have the weekend free, as I wfh and I work during the week and so does everyone else. I visit coffee shops all the time where I live. To fly to somewhere to go to a coffee shop just didn’t seem worth my time.

 I just feel my time was disrespected. But I still feel guilty for being  upset at it. I get it she’s a mom, and things get crazy and whatnot. However, I also have responsibilities, and I went out of my way to visit because she convinced me to.

I kind of feel like at this point, for my next visits maybe I shouldn’t prioritize our hang out time the way I do. I need to spread out my time to others in my life as well that I love to visit and haven’t seen in my other visits. I haven’t told her how I feel, but I think she knows. It’s just feels very inconsiderate of my time. How would you feel in this situation? ",3,1730610684.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gifpgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cabincrewcareers/comments/1gifpgg/tips_and_tricks_to_passing_your_interview_from_a/,Tips and tricks to passing your interview- from a Flight Attendant ,"I see a lot of Flight Attendants saying “just be yourself” when people ask them for advice on how to pass their in person group interview. I personally believe that is a very vague statement and does not really help much. Here are my personal tips and tricks, and you guys are free to share any questions you might have.

1. Do NOT drink Coffee before the interview- Coffee naturally makes people nervous, jittery, anxious. So if you're already feeling nervous, caffeine will only intensify it. They expect you to appear just a little nervous but also confident and comfortable, so my advice is avoid it at all costs.

2. Study, study, study- They will ask you from the most basic questions like ""tell me about yourself"" and ""why do you want to be a flight attendant?"" to the hardest questions like ""mention a time where a customer tested your patience"" or ""Mention a time you failed at something"" and ""Tell me about a time you had conflict with a coworker"". What worked best for me was *writing down* and *memorizing* answers to the possible situational questions and the possible everyday interview questions. There is such a thing as incorrect answers.

3. STAR method questions- When you answer situational questions, you definitely DO want to answer in that Situation, Task, Action, Result format; however don't over explain yourself, be CONCISE.
And what I mean by that is be clear and direct without unnecessary details but covering the important points thoroughly. Study how to answer these. What always helps me remember how to answer unexpected situational questions is thinking to myself ""okay they want to hear a sad story with a happy ending and I'm the hero"" and for some reason it works when I have to come up with scenarios on the spot.

4. OPTIONAL Stand Out- At the group interviews it is very common to see almost all the women (in my case) wearing the same classic black blazer, black skirt, white top, slick bun, etc. And that is exactly how you should be dressing for the most part, however, if you can, do something to your appearance that makes you stand out just a little while still looking professional. For example, my signature thing is wearing my hair half up-half down.
When I go to interviews, 98% of the women have their hair completely up. I like to think it's my good luck charm cause so far, it's worked for me. You want the interviewers to remember you, there might be like 70 people at that interview, and 68 of them will all look the same. Again this is super optional and my own personal preference.

5. Socializing- DON'T overdo it or under do it. Most people will tell you that you need to be outgoing/ extroverted at the group interview. And while that is generally the case, I would say stick to being an
*Ambivert*. I've seen so many people get carried away over-socializing and they do not make it through. Same thing with the under-socializers.
Have a balance. Not too introverted, not too extroverted.

1gifo70,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1gifo70/33_male_london_uk/,"33, Male, London, UK","Hey there all,

I'm not really sure this is the right place, or if I belong here, or what to think, but I need to say something somewhere to begin so why not here.

I have, in essence, lost all sense of libido and sexual desire in the past 6 or 7 years. It followed being cheated on by my girlfriend, whom I lived with, and kind of hoped we would always be together - since then I have had a real and serious struggle in finding intimacy. I don't know whether it's about trust, or some kind of guilt, or what, I just find whenever I think about getting, or trying to get close to somebody, my body decides it does not want to do that. At all. My subconscious is not interested, even if I feel like I am. I don't know if this is relatable at all but again, I need to say something because not doing so has become unbearable.

I am here, because for one I thought I'd see if anyone had been through the same, has had similar feelings, and if they'd come through, so to speak, to a happier side?

I have tried so many things - I've been to therapy, I've thrown myself into various forms of exercise and sport, I've shared these feelings with friends and family, I've tried to better myself, but honestly I don't know what I'm meant to do.

I am at the point where I don't feel anywhere near comfortable dating at all, but this in itself just compounds I guess this shit cycle.

  
Before I go on, I'll add some things about me. I am 33 years old, born and raised in London. I have always been very sporty, regularly playing football, squash, and less regularly tennis and recently golf. I am tall, at 6'2 (189cm), slim and I would say reasonably OK looking - I am not the best looking man in the world, but I have always had interest from better looking women (IMO). actually in most peoples opinion. Not important, anyway I think I'm a pretty regular looking person.

I am a civil servant and have been for 7 years, I live alone, and have done for8 years (?) more or less, and live with my cat. I am, and I really don't want to come across as too much of a dick, though I realise with every word I am making that less likely, that I am quite popular - I think this is mainly a symptom of growing up in London, being very close friends with all of my school friends, and all of us still living here. I have been fortunate in that sense.

This has become very rambly, but I think I need to be around a woman who can accept my dating and intimacy limitations - I really don't feel comfortable saying this to people I meet in person, or attaching my face to it, a la dating apps, but I need to do something as I said. I want to try and develop a closeness, starting with a friendship and seeing where things lead - again, on my part, with kind of not that much expectation I will suddenly become the person I used to be/want to be, but it would be nice to try and develop I guess some sense of physicality? and I mean that in the sense of cuddles, hand holding, just to get closer to another person again - I think my solitude in living alone, whilst I love it in so many ways, has not helped me.

  
So I'm not really sure what I\\m even asking - if you'd like to meet for a drink or a walk or a coffee or something, and if you could see yourself having a cuddle and watching a film or literally anything, I'd be really keen to try something like that. if that's something you might like to try, please get in contact.

  
Happy to chat on the phone or on a Skype or something else if you'd like, but yeah. I don;t know what to do so I'll try this.

  
Thanks for reading, if you have.

1gifnwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1gifnwl/should_i_reconnect/,Should I reconnect?,"I met a group of friends through a coworker a few months ago, and I loved hanging out with them. It was really the first friend group I’ve been a part of, and it seemed like everyone genuinely cared about each other. When I showed up to gatherings and walked in the room, people actually seemed happy to see me, and they were interested in me as a person. I’ve never really had that. 

I was fired from my job because some nosy person at work discovered some dumb things I did and got in legal trouble for in my teens (more than ten years ago), and my coworker removed me from the group chat. I was devastated. I finally had a job I enjoyed and finally had friends to share my life with, and it all fell apart within 24 hours. In a nutshell, I got in trouble because I had some online “relationships” when I was 18 or 19, and they were under 18. I really screwed up my life, but it’s not who I am. I was a confused, shy kid, but I’m trying to leave it in the past and show people that I’m a caring, altruistic person. I really wanted everyone in the group to know about my past - or at least the main people I actually hung out with regularly. But I didn’t have a chance. I was part of the group for less than two months, we got together maybe once a week, and most of us were drunk and/or high pretty much anytime we hung out. And it’s hard to find the right time to bring up something like my past. 

There were over 20 people in the friend group, but a select few were the core ones I spent time with the most and really enjoyed being around. I reconnected with the coworker friend after some strongly worded texts explaining how he handled the situation horribly, and taking about a month to just be alone and regroup my thoughts. We only got coffee once, and he’s horrible at responding to texts and calls. He was always bad at it, but especially now. I kinda feel like maybe he just wanted to clear the air between us in case I were to retaliate against my old employer (something I would never do). I’ve found other people from the group on Instagram or in my suggested friends on Facebook, and I really miss all of them. I don’t know how much they’ve heard about what happened, or what their opinion of me is if they do know. As angry and embarrassed as I was about the whole situation, a part of me also kinda hoped they would get together and show up at my house and reassure me that they know I’m a good person. And let me explain myself. Mostly, I’ve felt like the ball is in their court, so to speak, and they could reach out to me if they still valued me as a friend. I feel like I shouldn’t have to chase after them and ask them pretty please to be my friends again. But I really miss them. ",1,1730610389.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I’m currently 7 weeks post-op and I’m having a tough time with protein shakes. No matter what brand or type I try, they seem to upset my stomach, causing a burning sensation similar to acid reflux. This issue is exclusive to the protein shakes—I don’t have any other digestive problems.

Right now, I'm managing to get about 60g of protein from chicken and turkey, along with some yogurt drinks that have 20g of protein, totaling roughly 80g of protein a day. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and whether it’s possible to meet my protein needs without relying on shakes.

I’ve tried mixing the protein powder into coffee, smoothies, and even using pre-made options. I’ve also experimented with half scoops diluted in about 10 oz of water or almond milk, but nothing seems to work.

Cutting the extra's out I threw in at the end and focusing to the main cast with the supporting cast; I have a the following questions and offer the challenge's; this isn't homework nor does it have to be on point, just humor me and the idea here.

\-=-  
Once the players are on the island, any amount of ocean they touch, they are BANNED... in the sense they are removed from the game, captured and are dragged off the island, given warm Cocoa and inform their social media account of any kind has been deleted, they need to give up on social media permanently or start all over, again.  
(**THE OCEAN IS BASICALLY LAVA THE MOMENT THEY GET TO SHORE!!!... No, Tidal waves do count, just if they jump into water from the beach or anywhere on the island, they out.**)

**Daily Challenge's** are basically cancelling each other figuratively by yelling at them or until they mentally break-down and do the cancelling 'literally.' Getting to a food drop containing Coffee, Burgers, stuff from the mainland though if we want to be depraved, things you would never eat normally unless you had to survive... Which would be pineapple of pizza or whatever the internet thinks is detestable, but would still eat if it's the last thing to survive on.

In the case of cancelling, the last one on the island standing alive or not removed from the game is considered the winner and will be told where the phone is.

If the phone is found, they must reach the ocean with it to keep it permanently.

Last bit; each of them are bringing one item of their choosing to help them survive or get by on the island.

=-=

Which lead's me to ask, heck, even post your thought process of how each scenario would go down:  
Who do you think would FIND the phone first and fight over it?  
Who do you think will be removed from the contest first of the main cast I picked? Not the supporting cast.  
Who would suffer the most for this thing?  
Who will survive and learn the lesson that this is all insane; more insane than the MEME episode to teach the fame lesson.  
and ultimately, who will WIN the phone: Only to either fuck-up all social media to a point where noone is listening to them, they just block-them, they don't bother mentioning them to keep them in some perpetual idea they are still some kind of king like with the whole Yelp Reviewer and the only one to listen to them, providing he doesn't win the thing first, is Butters.",2,1730609765.0,southpark,5,0.75,False

","Little back story before we get to the main part. My dad is an alcoholic. For as long as i can remember he always had a drink in hand. As soon as he woke up he would make his whiskey and coke and would continue drinking until he went to bed. Wouldn’t drink any water, plain soda, coffee exc just his whiskey and coke. It got to the point that he would ask one of us (his kids) to make him a drink and because we have all seen him make them we all knew how. And yeah I know making my father his drink at the age of 14 isn’t something that should happen. 

Now for the recent stuff. I’m 22, lost my mom three years ago and my dad has been in and out (more in) of the hospital. They said he has liver failure, that he has 30 days to a year left to live if he keeps drinking the way he is. They also told him if he stop drinking now he can go on and live another 10 years (this was about 2 months ago) No matter how much we talk with him, he won’t stop drinking. He’s brining water bottles full of alcohol into the hospital with him so he won’t have to go without. It honestly breaks my heart. It makes me wonder why we’re not good enough for him to quit. Why can’t I be enough? I know deep down it’s the addiction and not because he doesn’t love us (his kids) I just wish he would finally put the bottle down, that he will be alive when my husband and I decide to have kids but honestly it’s not looking to good. He’s been getting worse, he’s real jaundice, has fluid building up in his feet, legs, and stomach that he has to go to the hospital for them to drain. Always has some sort of infection that he’s always have to get antibiotics for. 

I’m just so tired of being upset and also terrified to get a call that he’s in the hospital and that he won’t be going home. ",6,1730609602.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

""maraziel"" was the username. Mikhzul Araziel, his father, who died two months ago after a sudden disease. Rostion wasn't planning on making any permanent changes, just have a glance.

He thought he could recognize some of the names, based on the conversations his father had with people he knew. The name of one project caught his attention.

RealSim. Reality Simulator.

That was one of the big ones, a major project he worked on with an entire team of other people. The project was still being worked on even, after his death. *Better be careful not to break something,* Rostion thought. He downloaded a local copy. The code looked complicated, written in a programming language Rostion knew only the bare basics of, but compiling it was easy.

About 20 minutes later, with a cup of coffee on his side, Rostion started the freshly compiled piece of software.

It looked like a game from more than 20 years ago, but not as complicated, and it gave the player the role of a creator god. A session would take a couple of hours, with actual creation being only the first half. The second half was ruling over a civilization. The species Rostion ended up creating seemed to have a heavy preference towards polytheistic faiths, so he wanted to see if he can cause a monotheistic religion to rise.

That turned out to be a challenge.

Rostion wasn't entirely sure why, but it appeared that his ""chosen people"" were highly rebellious, always reverting back to polytheism no matter what kind of punishment he'd dish out. Maybe it was that preference? Even some of the prophets he sent met grisly ends. To make it even worse, it appeared he was starting to run out of the so-called god power, making him less able to influence his people. As a last ditch effort, he decided to create one very special prophet, a reformer to save the kingdom from corruption.

And then his ""chosen people"" decided that the prophet has to be executed.

Rostin sighed, and got up to take a short break. When he came back, he realized he forgot to pause. Not only that, but it appeared the last prophet actually triggered a monotheistic religion to appear, which treated him as a martyr and god's son. He would have preferred to accomplish it without blood sacrifice, but hey, at least his goal was finally done.

Rostin decided it was enough for today and closed the simulation, planning to go back to it tomorrow. AS he was sliding into bed, he wondered how this is going to change his people. Not for very good, if his initial experience is any clue.",1,1730609336.0,Roger_BP_Baker,0,1.0,False

We went to a museum but we got so caught up in getting to know each other that we found the art boring and went and laid in an empty field outside and talked until the sun set. It was a instant, magnetic connection. A feeling of rightness that I can never quite recapture. We were both barely 20 but we bonded over being old souls who saw the world in a deeper way. I usually always felt weird around other people my age, but she made me feel at home for once.

We only dated until October 2023, but everything leading up to that one day, the breakup day, was all I could have ever asked for. She loved me so beautifully. In August she painted me a sunset with pink clouds because it was ""what she thought of when she looked at me."" Hid it behind my bookshelf with a handwritten letter and poem and texted me after she dropped by to say it was there, a little secret gift. She used to wake up before me and make me coffee and bring it up to me, or give me hugs in my sleep when I was having night terrors. I know looking back that she was the only person I ever genuniely loved, even if our relationship was on the shorter side. We never had a dull moment.

She broke up with me because she experienced a relapse in her depression and panic disorder. It became hard for her to leave the house and to share things with me like she used to. I was, unfortunately, going through tough times too and may have been too hard on her. I told her I was feeling ""unloved,"" when she began to withdraw, and I regret that to this day because it was a week after that emotional breakdown of mine that she called to say that I deserved better, that I deserved the world.

We haven't talked since then. Part of me wants to reach out still, to see how she is. Our breakup was so sudden and emotional and I was so blindsided by it all. But people keep telling me to just get over her, it's been a year, but I can't. I've been on dates recently and I just think of her and I instantly feel cold.

So sorry for the long post, but this week has been a WILD ride, and all these details feel relevant.  I (27F) have always believed in strong community ties, and so over the 5-ish years I’ve lived in my current place, I make an effort to do small things for my neighbors and ask my neighbors for assistance when reasonable. This includes things like housekeeping, rides, making food, borrowing ingredients, and small loans (<$50, only to those who pay back consistently).  Two such neighbors are single women on disability/SSI, who we will call Beth (67F) and Mae (63F) Beth borrows $10-20 on a rolling basis and pays me back fairly quickly. Mae is currently giving me monthly gas money to be her ride to and from her job most days. 

I recently started saving up loose change and cash in preparation for Christmas. At the same time, Beth in particular has had been asking for more and more help, including rides and errands, since her car was in an accident and isn’t drivable. She’s also been asking me to buy her a pack of cigarettes like every other week. Two weeks ago, I started to lose track of the favors and amount of money she owed me, and I offered her a deal that we’ve done a few times: while I’m visiting family for a few days, she can come in and do some cleaning, and I’ll clear the ledger. Before I left, I forgot to put the vacation envelope away in a drawer, so it was sitting out in a place where it could easily be seen for what it was. I had fully intended to put it away in a drawer where I knew she wouldn’t go looking. 

While I was gone, Beth called, left a voicemail, and texted me on two separate days asking to borrow $20 out of the envelope while she was cleaning, and both times I texted back promptly and told her to leave the envelope alone. I come back from my trip, and the bills had been altered. The dollar amount was the same. I assumed that she had used my envelope to make change, and she readily admitted that she had taken $5 out and put it back. (Her wording consistently suggests that she had taken $5, left my apartment, and then came back to my apartment at a later point to put it back, which is stealing, as opposed to ‘making change’ which is what I initially thought.) 

I was irritated by this, and I texted her back that she should have asked first before messing with my envelope. I was away from my phone for 8 minutes, and when I come back, there’s two smaller messages further explaining exactly how she had altered the envelope, and admitting she should have asked, and then a massive text message that can basically be summed up ‘I bet that B**** Tina has been talking about me, but my problems are my business, and she isn’t the friend you think she is.” (Tina is 40-something F,  another neighbor, not really relevant to the story beyond being involved with the above mentioned car issue)

I knew about the car drama, but I hadn’t spoken with Tina in a while, and this felt very out of left field. I texted Beth back asking where this came from, and was greeted with a massive guilt trip/pity party. I love Beth to pieces, she’s generally really sweet, but she throws herself pity parties like a professional event planner.  At least 3x a month I get to bear witness to one.  For the record, lending money, giving rides, etc, none of that had ever irritated me, but the pity parties do, and I have very kindly expressed that several times, even explaining in different wordings in case she has Rejection-Sensitive Dysphoria. I have had RSD in the past, so I know how it feels, but after the 8th time being reassured, most people would at least attempt to cut back on it. Anyway, I was already at my limit from the long trip, and admittedly lost my cool a bit. I announced that since she was so convinced that I must be upset with her, I will play along and be upset with her. I then took a $20 bill out of my wallet and left it in her door, since she had been SO desperate to borrow it earlier in the week, and then texted her that automatically assuming people are upset with her/irritated by her/talking about her makes her a very unkind person, that Tina had never ever said anything unfair or unkind about her to me, and asked that she extend Tina the same courtesy. I also revoked access to my apartment. 

Over the next several days, as I am ducking her calls because I want to cool down and not say something in the heat of the moment, she starts leaving text messages and voicemails relentlessly:
•Repeatedly demanded to know what she did to make me upset at her, and just as many times insisted she would leave me alone once I told her. 
•Asked me to buy her another pack of cigarettes. 
•Admitted she took the money, but she put it back, so it doesn’t count
•Implied I shouldn’t be upset with her because she had cleaned up my place nicely,as if it was a favor, and not working off a debt
•Insisted that the amount of cleaning she did was a larger monetary value than the debt she owed, implying that I actually owed her money now
• called me a teenager with an attitude problem
•took great issue with the words ‘steal’ and ‘unkind’, demanded that those words not be used. 
•tried to wait outside the door to the building to make me talk to her on my way in
•cooked a holiday-caliber meal and took offense when I declined to take any. 
•when I ultimately set a boundary after talking to my therapist that I would no longer lend her more than $20 at a time, and would not be buying anymore cigarettes either, she immediately asked if this meant I wouldn’t be giving her any more rides. 


This past Sunday, she left a final voicemail throwing herself another pity party and then insisting that she’s been a good neighbor to me, that I need to pick something else to be upset about, and that she’ll leave me alone, but she refuses to let me put the blame on her.  
ERR404: Apology not found. 

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I had sent her a long text very clearly laying out that while the stealing was a betrayal of trust and hurtful, it was these pity parties and jumping to conclusions that had me upset, and why they are what bother me(demanding more mental real estate from me while performatively apologizing for taking up any at all), and simple mindfulness exercises that helped me when I Struggled with RSD. So she has been told, and has also been told how to fix it. She just doesn’t want to. 

Here’s where I might be TA:

Two days ago, Mae asked me if she could borrow money in order for her to buy two cartons of cigarettes, promising to pay me back on payday, which she always has. I expressed that in the wake of all of this Beth Drama(which she was aware of, she’s seen the texts), I wasn’t comfortable lending money to anyone right now. She got upset, insisting that Beth’s issues had nothing to do with her and she had a perfect record of paying me back when she says she will. She then tried to negotiate to a single carton, and then pouted, saying she only has $26 until payday, and that she needs to spend it on food. I reminded her that next week I was going to take her to our food bank after work so she would have more groceries. Still pouting, she cracked a joke about preferring the cigarettes over food. This morning, Mae was very grumpy when I picked her up, she had clearly missed her morning cup of coffee, so I pulled into a drive-thru and bought her a $2 cup of coffee. She insisted that she would pay me back, and resisted when I said it was my treat, and happy Halloween. She said she would pay me back because ‘I know how sensitive you are about money right now’

I know Mae had nothing to do with the whole Beth Drama, but the whole thing left me so drained, since Beth has clearly been treating me like an ATM and taxi service over the last few years, using food(which she regularly insists ‘isn’t any good’ after I take the plate from her-another pity party) and cleaning to cover up her intentions. I just don’t know if I’m unreasonably ’punishing the class’ so to speak. I also don’t know if declining to loan money but then buying her a cup of coffee as a favor is sending mixed messages.

i’ve done really well with this phobia lately, but tonight has got me worked up badly. 

to start i sort of know my problem, but ive had worse eating / water days then this & have been completely fine. 

i had half of a bang, a few sips of a medium coffee, a couple fries, a few bites of salad & a few bites of steak. i’ve barely had any water. ive also been super constipated for WEEKS, and have had little to moderate success these past few days with bowel movements. 

i was playing mario party with my brother & dad and as i sat up on the couch better after about an hour i felt my stomach drop and i IMMEDIATELY got super hot. i got anxiety of course so went and changed into shorts and laid down. i keep getting hot flashes, i don’t feel particularly nauseous really but the hot flashes and anxiety striking me at the same time as the hot flashes is driving me nuts. i NEVER feel like this. i turned 24 fucking today and had a good day. i didn’t feel like i was anxious or anything throughout the day either. 

i cant take any of my nighttime meds (im too scared) but my brother had a zofran so i took one of those as i cant swallow my normal nausea meds (for an unrelated health issue) i also left my remerron at home i take nightly but its only night 2 without it & i spent 4 days in jail with NO meds and was fine!!! 

what is happening to me? why is this happening to me? i can’t stop shaking and i feel like this episode is going to set back so much progress for me. ): i just want to talk to someone who can relate to these feelings. i’m just left feeling sad like why is this happening to me right now ",1,1730608036.0,emetophobia,2,1.0,False

I use a moka pot, and usually have my coffee with milk and jaggery but even then, I could taste the floral notes. 
A bit pricey for sure, but worth it for me. 
Plus the box itself was really interesting with cool collectible bits - like a pull out film of the photo shown here.

1gieyk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALawyer/comments/1gieyk7/new_mexico_put_in_a_position_different_than_the/,"[New Mexico] Put in a position different than the one I was hired for, employer refusing to start ADA request process and instead telling me I can move positions with a signifiant pay cut.","
I started a new job about two weeks ago, and originally applied and interviewed for a sous chef position.  i was told that position had been filled, but they had a “very similar” position they could offer me instead. I assumed by similar they meant a lower-level back of house management position in the kitchen. After signing, I was shown the actual place I would be managing, and it’s a convenience store with a small grill in the back. I have PTSD as well as an anxiety disorder, which i don’t disclose in the hiring process due to worries of discrimination, and it has never been an issue in the past as I only apply for and work jobs with minimal to no customer interaction, so it rarely causes issues that can’t fit within a later reasonable accommodation.

This is where I’m likely in the wrong- because the lag is very good, I didn’t complain and decided I would just give it a shot. A week and several flare ups that nearly resulted in a suicide attempt later, I asked if I could meet with HR to see about filing an ADA accommodation request and being moved to a position similar to the one I was hired for.  I do not have this in writing, but have text messages to my boss of right before I asked in person.  I went in for the meeting a few days ago, and it was so bad I almost quit on the spot- I was told that I knew exactly the job I was getting into (I didn’t, I was only told what my actual position was for the first time in the meeting), and that they could move me if i wanted, but my pay will have to be docked down to minimum wage, almost $10 below what I am being paid now.  I was told my request to file a request was denied because if I have issues being around customers, I would have the same issues with my coworkers. This assumption completely negates that my coworkers are people I’ll get to know, can set boundaries with, and, if they violate these boundaries, have actual recourse against.  I did not have the foresight to record the meeting.

In addition to the other issues, I’m not provided with parking, causing me to have to park about a mile away in not a great area. I get off after 1 am, and having to walk a mile in the middle of night absolutely doesn’t help my symptoms at all. It also turns my commute from a 15 minute drive to a whole ordeal that takes about an hour.

I’m back at work, and things have not gotten better. I am close to quitting, but need the income.  From talking to other coworkers, this is a very common practice here- one person I talked to was hired to work at a coffee shop on campus, and instead was put at the same place I work.

I’m not wanting to sue, I just want to know if there’s anything I can do to get them to actually file my accommodation request until I can get a new job.",1,1730607723.0,AskALawyer,3,1.0,False

What I care about:

* Opens late on weekends - 9pm or later
* Parking is not very difficult to find
* No loud music to the point where I can't have conversations with people without yelling.
* \[bonus\] Large seating area - e.g. [Ebony and Ivory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gup8vRMzCNiEyb8H6)

What I care less about

* Quality of coffee
* Price -- $10+ / cup is okay if the place is amazing (e.g. 5 stars hotel)
* Driving distance, as long as it's within 45 minutes from Bellevue

Good examples are [Woods coffee (Bellevue)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GBywFBmsL7G7xCob7), [Mercury Coffee (Bellevue)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHfRjtDV7epTwdci7), [Mr West (University Village)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N1txyvyzpsNP2uVX7).  What else?  Are there coffee lounges in classy hotels that offer a similar atmosphere and meet the above criteria?
