1htbdxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FibromyalgiaIsReal/comments/1htbdxo/my_pain_is_real/,My pain is real,"Does anyone else wake up feeling like they have hot lava pouring down there entire body? I get constant burning pain from head to toe. I find mornings and nights right before bedtime are the worst for my pain. Sometimes I can barely tolerate it. On days where flare up is really bad I will literally sleep the entire day. On top of this I have sciatica degenerative disc disease one torn two herniated to bulging, arthritis in my back and hips, spinal stenosis, a torn tendon in my left hip that healed wrong, severe generalized anxiety, in last but not least ADHD. 

I may have left something out it's hard for me to think. When my kids stress me out my burning pain gets worse and right now my little one is trying to get my attention.

My medication helps me manage it but it's still very relevant in my everyday life. I take the smallest dose I can take at a time of my medications. I requested them in 300 mg so I could break it down throughout my days in smallest dose possible. so I don't get tired or drowsy while taking them.

I used to drink a lot of monsters to keep myself awake but I can't do that anymore because I'm causing dehydration. Send that causes a different kind of pain mostly in my feet. I tried drinking coffee but coffee just makes me feel nauseated. I have no idea how to stay awake.

I need help to figure out ways to get energy and keep that energy up. I have three boys to keep up with and it's very difficult. I need help I do my best to do physical therapy everyday, but it's not enough. I don't know what to do it's so hard to live with this. I'm also a vegetarian because I found couldn't meet out of my diet so manage my pain I think red meat and meat in general seems to cause inflammation. I just stiffen up in my body Burns constantly.

It took me several years and lots of research to find a good place to get treatment. I researched doctor after doctor and had so many bad ones that when I finally found a good one I latched on to my doctor like butter on toast. When he retired he passed the torch on to his partner Dr. Kasendek. He is very supportive kind and understanding. Took me a long time to find a good doctor I literally live with anxiety with fear that my doctor will retire or get overwhelmed and move to a new specialty. Right now he does Family Medicine but he does really well with managing my pain, but I wish I could just make it disappear so I could function everyday without pain. :-(

I'm hoping there is some type of experimental treatment out there I can try. I am tired of taking so much medication and doing so much physical therapy just to get through my day",1,1735985165.0,FibromyalgiaIsReal,0,1.0,False

1htbcd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoaScams/comments/1htbcd5/goa_beware_of_the_scams_in_the_name_of_lucky/,GOA - Beware of the scams in the name of lucky coupons/scratch cards,"IF YOU'RE IN GOA - PLEASE DON'T STOP IF ANYBODY ASKS YOU TO SCRATCH A CARD OR COUPON.

Have been to Goa a few times and to North and South Goa both.

A common pattern noted across all the places irrespective of North or South (and got a first hand experience) is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort like Sobit Sarovar Portico in Palolem or Grand Leoney resort in Vagator or something similar depending on where you are, and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a conference room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Le Meridian, Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this organisations (Loyal Tree or Go Life Vacations) but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be able to utilize it.

1htb9ls,https://i.redd.it/f6bxpywo9yae1.jpeg,Shitty day turned alright :),"Spent the first half of the day miserable unable to hitchhike out of Woodbridge, VA. At one point it started snowing in an instant. Considering I had already spent 3 hours trying to hitch a ride I said fuck it knowing this neighborhood was way too nice for any of these snooty fucks to pickup a hitchhiker. Soon as I caught a break in the snow I departed the Wendy‚Äôs I had taken refuge in and walked an hour to the nearest train station. It was only 2 stops to Fredericksburg so I took a gamble and got on the train without a ticket. It was near the end of the line on a night commuter train and as I suspected the conductor never came to my car to check tickets. 

I wasn‚Äôt in the clear yet because when I got to the station hoping to catch the Amtrak it was an hour delayed. I laid on a slab of concrete miserably bundled in my sleeping bag for about 2 hours monitoring the temperature as it began to drop below 30. ‚ÄúI paid $16 for this?‚Äù, I thought to myself. But alas the Amtrak came through just in time to save me from the cold and save my phone from dying. 

Still it was cold as fuck and as soon as I got out of that station the next plan was to catch an overnight bus to Fayetteville, NC. I told myself I‚Äôd wait until I was at the bus stop to decide if I would be willing to shell out the $50 for the bus ticket. $50 ain‚Äôt cheap but the thought of a warm bus to sleep on sounded better than spending the night outside in 25 degree weather. Well the universe had a different plan because after sprinting to the local bus stop across the street the bus driver informed me the bus heading to the greyhound station was on the other side of the street. And like in that episode of SpongeBob (if you‚Äôve seen it you know the one, otherwise disregard this) by the time I started running back to the other side there it went the last bus of the night drove past me. I had missed it by seconds. 

Google said it was a 90 min walk to the greyhound stop but that greyhound would be gone in just under an hour. I thought about lightly jogging with my heavy ass pack but I relented and resigned myself to the cold. I layered up, slipped on my balaclava, and bummed a cigarette from a doorman as I walked the downtown Richmond towards a Mickey D‚Äôs I was hoping would have an open lobby. An hour later I get there and of course the lobby is closed. 

The silver lining, I had been talking to a really nice girl on Tinder for the past hour as I walked through Richmond. The conversation was going really well and she seemed empathetic so unabashedly I asked her if she‚Äôd like to grab a bite. She said yes and as I waited for her a tiny homeless woman who looked even colder than me asked me for directions to bus station. When I told her it was an hour walk she looked mortified. The thought of her walking with all her bags in this weather broke my heart but luckily the girl I had been talking to didn‚Äôt mind taking her up the road to the station where we left her in the warmth of the greyhound station lobby. We then went to Waffle House and enjoyed black coffee with pancakes for a few hours, best company I ever got for $20. I‚Äôve had women let me stay the night but this girl was really nice and I didn‚Äôt want her to think I had ulterior motives. I asked her to take me back to the station where I would take a bus in a few hours. Instead I found some hollow bushes near a freeway on ramp and it‚Äôs pretty warm in here desire it being 25 degrees. I‚Äôm also very well hidden and I‚Äôll get some quality sleep. I may stick around a few days and take in the city, isn‚Äôt that what the road is all about?

This disease followed me while I sought to be far away from the abuse, disfunction and poverty of my family. Vowing to never be like them.
This disease followed into a marriage with a narcissistic, addict of every kind.

1htb6m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1htb6m3/buying_used_espresso_machines_300/,Buying used Espresso Machines [300‚Ç¨],"Hey everyone!

I've wanted to get into the coffee rabiithole for a while now and have spent the last few weeks just drinking pourovers with beans ground by a Kingrinder K6.  
Now I want to take the jump and (slowly) get into Espresso but don't want to spend too much money, in case I don't have as much fun with that as I do with preparing my pourovers

I think I've pretty much narrowed it down to either starting out with a Rancillio SIlvia or a Gaggia Classic and was wondering if anyone here knows a good place on where to get a good sale on them. I'm based in Germany and don't mind buying a used machine for my first time but seeing as stuff like ebay has VAST pricing differences I was just wondering if I was missing any essential resource.

I've found offers starting from like 200-300 euros for a used machine without any accessories which seems like an alright deal for someone who doesn't know how low the prices normally go here.

Thanks in advance and I'm excited to join the community!",1,1735984297.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I still remember the day our world changed. Not just the election - everyone expected that after the chaos of 2024 - but our personal universe. Sarah and I had been the typical progressive couple, our Berkeley degrees hanging proudly on our apartment wall, our social media full of activist hashtags and protest photos. I'd always felt lucky to have her - with her flowing brown hair, gentle smile, and that fierce intelligence that lit up her eyes during debates. She was way out of my league, but our shared values had brought us together. Every time she'd grab my hand during protests, or kiss me after another successful activist meeting, I felt validated. Her choosing me, loving me, felt like proof I was on the right side of history. We thought we were untouchable in our moral certainty, our love a testament to progressive values triumphing over shallow appearances and traditional roles.

That was before Brad.

We first encountered him at what would become one of the last liberal protests in our city. He stood there, towering at 6'4"", blonde hair perfectly styled, wearing an expensive suit with a MAGA pin that seemed to gleam in the sunlight. While we chanted about democracy, he just smirked, recording us with his phone.

""You know, you two would look better in red,"" he called out, his eyes lingering on Sarah. I noticed her slight pause, the way her breath caught. At the time, I dismissed it.

Over the next few weeks, Brad seemed to appear everywhere. At our local coffee shop, at the grocery store, even at the gym. Each time, he'd make a point to engage us, particularly Sarah. His arguments were delivered with a confidence that bordered on arrogance, each word dripping with condescension.

""The problem with you liberals,"" he'd say, ""is that you don't understand natural order. Some people are meant to lead, others to follow."" His eyes would lock with Sarah's during these moments, and I'd notice her cheeks flush.

The first real crack in our resistance came when Sarah started watching conservative news, claiming she wanted to ""understand the other side."" I'd catch her pausing on Brad's social media posts, lingering over photos of him at MAGA rallies, commanding crowds with his presence.

One evening, Brad ""coincidentally"" appeared at our apartment building. He invited himself up, taking command of our space like he owned it. He sat in my favorite chair, his expensive shoes resting on our coffee table. Sarah's face showed a mix of disgust and something else... something that worried me. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not welcome here‚Äù Sarah said crossing her arms, putting on her best activist face; but her voice wavered


""Your place could use a real man's touch,"" he commented, watching Sarah's reaction. ""Why don't you get us some drinks, sweetheart? And you,"" he turned to me, ""my shoes are a bit dusty from walking here.""

""Don't you dare call me-"" she started, but he cut her off.
""Now."" One word, spoken with such authority that her protest died. She looked at me apologetically, then moved toward the kitchen. 

""Leave her alone,"" I demanded, trying to sound tough. Brad's laugh made me feel like a child. 

""Or what?"" He turned to Sarah, returning with his drink. ""On your knees, princess.""

Her legs trembled. I could see the internal struggle in her eyes - her ideology fighting against something deeper, more primal.

""We won't-"" I started, but Sarah's sharp intake of breath stopped me. She was sinking to her knees, her face flushed with shame and arousal.


""Sarah, don't!"" But my words sounded weak, even to me.

Brad smiled, reaching out to stroke her hair. ""Good girl. See how natural this feels?"" Sarah tried to pull away, but her resistance was weakening. ""Now, your boyfriend needs to learn too.""

""I won't-"" I started, but Brad's movement cut me off. He grabbed my shirt, trying to yank me down. I stumbled but caught myself, pulling away. ""Get your hands off me!""

""Sarah first. Show your man how it's done.""

Sarah hesitated for just a moment, her last fragment of resistance dissolving as Brad's hand guided her head down. The moment her tongue touched his expensive leather shoe, something changed in her eyes. The struggle vanished, replaced by a glazed look of pure submission.

""Oh god,"" she moaned, no longer playing at resistance. Her tongue traced every curve of his shoes, working with desperate enthusiasm. She shifted position to reach the soles, licking the dirt and grime with obvious relish.

""Look at your woman,"" Brad told me, his hand stroking her hair as she worked. ""This is what she was always meant for.""

I watched in horror as my feminist girlfriend, who just last week had led a women's rights rally, began sucking on the laces of Brad's shoes. She was lost in her own world, completely ignoring my presence, focusing entirely on worshiping every inch of his footwear.

""Please stop,"" I begged, my voice cracking. ""Sarah, this isn't you!""

She didn't even look up, just moaned louder as her tongue collected the dirt from the bottom of his shoe.

""Your turn,"" Brad commanded me. ""On your knees.""

""No,"" I said, trying to sound firm despite the tremor in my voice. ""I won't-""

Brad cut me off by grabbing Sarah's hair, pulling her up onto his lap. She went willingly, eagerly, her lips parted in anticipation.

""Last chance,"" he warned, his hand sliding under Sarah's shirt. ""Beg to lick my shoes, or watch me take what's mine.""

""I... I can't..."" My resistance was crumbling as Sarah arched into his touch.

""Tell him what he needs to say, princess,"" Brad commanded.

Sarah's eyes opened, fixing on me with a mix of pity and arousal. ""Beg him properly, baby. Say 'Please, Sir, let me lick your shoes.'""

""I won't-"" My protest was cut short as Brad's hand slipped into Sarah's pants, making her moan loudly.

""Say it,"" he ordered again. ""Or watch me make your woman cum right here.""

My entire world was crashing down. Every principle, every belief I'd held dear was crumbling in the face of this primal display of dominance. Sarah's eyes rolled back as Brad's fingers worked their magic.

""P-please..."" I choked out.

""Please what?"" Brad prompted, his other hand unbuttoning Sarah's blouse.

""Please... Sir..."" Each word was agony. ""Let me... let me lick your shoes.""

Sarah's laugh cut through me like a knife. ""God, he looks so pathetic,"" she giggled, then moaned as Brad rewarded her cruel observation with his fingers.

""He does, doesn't he?"" Brad agreed. ""Tell him how natural he looks down there.""

""You belong there, baby,"" Sarah purred. ""On your knees, begging to serve Sir... oh god..."" she trailed off as Brad's fingers moved faster.

""Sir?"" I repeated weakly.

""That's right,"" Sarah managed between moans. ""You will address him as Sir from now on. Now get down there and lick his shoes clean while he fingers me.""

I sank to my knees, my last shred of dignity dissolving as my tongue touched leather. The taste of dirt and leather filled my mouth as Sarah's moans filled my ears. Each lick felt like an admission, each stroke of my tongue acknowledging my place in this new hierarchy.

""Good libcuck,"" Brad praised mockingly. ""You're learning. Sarah, tell him how proud you are.""

""So proud,"" she gasped, grinding against his hand. ""Such a good little shoe cleaner... oh fuck, Sir, please...""


That night, Brad claimed our bedroom like he'd claimed everything else. I knelt naked in the corner, his shoes placed before me as a reminder of my place. Sarah was bent over our bed - the same bed where we'd once planned protest strategies - her face pressed into a MAGA hat while Brad took her roughly from behind.

""Thank me,"" he growled, spanking her ass hard enough to leave a handprint.

""Thank you, Sir!"" Sarah cried out. ""Thank you for showing me my place!"" Each thrust made her grip the sheets tighter. ""Thank you for putting this liberal whore in her place!""

""Clean deeper,"" Brad commanded me, noticing I'd slowed my worship of his shoes. ""Get your tongue between every crevice."" When I hesitated, he grabbed Sarah's hair. ""Should I make her suffer for your disobedience?""

My tongue worked faster, probing the stitching of his expensive shoes, gathering every speck of dirt. The taste of leather and filth was becoming frighteningly familiar.

""Good boy,"" he mocked. ""Now crawl over here and clean my feet while I fuck your woman.""

I crawled, my resistance warring with my growing submission. Brad's feet were sweaty, the space between his toes dark with lint and grime. As Sarah moaned in pleasure, I was forced to suck each toe clean, swallowing whatever I found there.

""Tell him how much better this is,"" Brad ordered Sarah.

""So much better than your weak liberal dick,"" she gasped. ""Sir knows how to treat a woman... how to make her serve...""

The next weeks were a blur of escalating submission. Brad moved us to his house, claiming our apartment was ""too liberal."" He burned our progressive books, replacing them with conservative literature. Sarah was made to read them aloud while servicing him.

One morning, Brad presented Sarah with a MAGA hat. ""Your new uniform,"" he declared. She not only wore it but kissed it reverently before putting it on. My protests earned me a week in chastity - the first of many.

""The cage stays on until you learn,"" Brad informed me. ""Sarah, show him what good behavior earns.""

I watched as he pissed in her eager mouth, her thank yous mixing with her swallows. When she finished, she looked at me with pity. ""It's so much better when you accept it, baby. His piss tastes better than your cum ever did.""

The day we voted was particularly humiliating. Brad made us wear MAGA gear to the polling place, Sarah in a tight red dress, me in a collar and leash. Our former activist friends saw us, their disgust evident. But when we returned, Brad rewarded us by letting us clean his feet with our tongues.

""Look what I found,"" he said one evening, holding up nail clippers. ""Sarah first.""

I watched my former girlfriend eagerly eat his toenail clippings, thanking him for each one. When my turn came, I tried to resist.

""Fine,"" Brad smiled cruelly. ""Sarah, bend over. Each time he refuses, you get the belt.""

The crack of leather on flesh broke me. Soon I was begging for his toenails, thanking him as each one crossed my lips.

Our transformation continued relentlessly. Brad would host MAGA parties where we served drinks naked, our bodies written with conservative slogans. Sarah took to it eagerly, while I had to be motivated with threats and punishment.

""Please, Sir,"" Sarah would beg each morning, ""let me drink your piss. Let me show you how grateful I am.""

When I resisted similar requests, Brad would make me watch as he pleased her in ways I never could, until I broke and begged too.

The final surrender came on a quiet Sunday evening. Brad had the papers ready - property deeds, bank accounts, everything we owned. Sarah knelt eagerly beside his chair while I stood, that last ember of resistance still flickering.

""Time to make it official,"" Brad announced, patting his lap where the papers lay. ""Who wants to sign first?""

Sarah crawled forward immediately. ""Please, Sir, let me sign everything over to you.""

""Not yet,"" Brad smirked. ""First, tell me who you love most in this world.""

Sarah looked at me apologetically, then turned to Brad with devotion in her eyes. ""You, Sir. Only you. You've shown me what real love is - serving, obeying, worshiping.""

""And you?"" Brad turned to me. I stayed silent, that last bit of pride keeping my tongue still.

""Strip,"" he commanded. ""Both of you.""

As our clothes fell away, Brad stood and turned, presenting his ass. ""You want to sign? Earn it. Show me how much you love serving a real man.""

Sarah dove in first, her tongue eagerly probing his ass. Her moans of pleasure were genuine - she'd grown to crave this degradation. I watched, trembling, as my former girlfriend worshiped our Master's hole with passionate dedication.

""Your turn,"" Brad commanded me. When I hesitated, he grabbed Sarah's hair. ""Maybe she needs motivation to leave you completely? To never speak to you again?""

""No, please,"" I begged, falling to my knees. My face pressed against his ass, tongue extending. The taste was humiliatingly familiar now - we'd done this so many times, but this felt different. Final.

""Tell me you love me,"" Brad demanded. ""Both of you. Tell me I'm your god.""

""I love you, Sir,"" Sarah breathed between licks. ""You're my god, my everything. Thank you for saving me from weak liberalism.""

My resistance crumbled as Brad spread his cheeks wider. ""I... I love you, Sir. You're my god. Thank you for showing me my place.""

""Prove it,"" he commanded. ""Prayer position. Both of you.""

We fell into the familiar pose - foreheads touching the floor, asses raised, hands stretched toward his feet.

""Dear Sir,"" Sarah began praying, ""thank you for breaking us, for showing us true purpose. Thank you for every drop of piss, every speck of dirt between your toes, every moment of humiliation...""

""Join her,"" Brad ordered me.

Tears fell as I prayed, my former self finally dying completely. ""Thank you, Sir, for destroying my pride, for showing me what I really am. Thank you for taking Sarah from me, for making her yours...""

Brad made us alternate between rimming him and praying for an hour before finally allowing us to sign. Sarah went first, kissing each page before signing away everything she owned. When my turn came, Brad had me sign while continuing to lick his ass.

""Now you're both officially property,"" Brad declared. ""And property doesn't own property.""

""Thank you, Sir,"" we said in unison, falling back into prayer position.

That night, he took Sarah while I cleaned their sweat with my tongue. But something had changed - the last walls were gone. When Brad ordered us to kiss his feet and thank him for freeing us from the burden of ownership, of identity, of liberal weakness, our gratitude was genuine.

Now early in to 2025, the crypto market is on the verge of the greatest alt season ever seen.  
  
More specifically, a ‚Äúmemecoin supercycle‚Äù as labelled by much of CT.  
  
It happened in 2017 and 2021. The alt seasons gave rise to events such as Shib exploding in 2021, where it saw a rise from 22m to 22B in only 36 days around April that year.  
  
Standing now on the precipice of crypto greatness once again, there lay ahead of us an opportunity for many established communities to take this cycle all the way to the top, just like Shib.  
  
The foundation laid in 2024 and early 2025 is what will determine success during the imminent alt season. Communities with conviction and belief, ones that inspire, provide a sense of belonging and give motivation to those who participate.

  
**Why Kendu is in pole position to win this cycle** 

  
Launched in Feb of 2024, Kendu has now seen 10+ months of proof of life and establishment.  
  
With constant growth, engagement and awareness spreading of the Kendu name, it has been our mission to ensure we are in pole position to capture the decabillions this cycle.  
  
We have grown day in and day out, 10 months after launch, which means that we are here to stay and there is genuinely only one way now for us to go - up. 2024 was a year comprised of foundation building and community development, experiencing the necessary periods of redistribution and growth that are essential for any organic memecoin to hit the billions.  


\*The community is so large and so decentralized that it is hard to capture all the alpha in one post, so i strongly recommend you read through the x article link located at the bottom of this post.\*

**2024 Achievements**  
  
In the early days of Kendu we saw Shytoshi, the Shib dev, messaging within our TG and offering words of encouragement. He follows our doxxed dev, Miazaki, and the main Kendu page as well. In fact, he is so linked to our dev he even placed us on Shib mag.

[Shib Mag](https://preview.redd.it/7tg0r8czwxae1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=94d63ac5cd8419bf48165692ce2a15e3c652bfee)

Kendu is not a community to remain in the shadow of another, though. We aim to cast our own shadow and to take the number 1 spot.

  
Recognising that community is the ultimate driver of success for a memecoin, we have cultivated a perpetual culture of hard work and an unparalleled sense of unity under our motto: ""We do not gamble, we work.""

  
This dedication has propelled us to achieve an ATH of $280M mc in a pre-bull run market‚Äîan impressive feat rarely seen during that period last year.

Our success has been entirely organic, with no reliance on paid KOLs or paid marketing, as we understand it only leads to pump-and-dumps. This approach has fostered consistent and sustained growth in our social presence and holders.

Even during the huge market dips, shakeouts and massive Eth drops of the last 10 months, our holders have never seen a decrease.

[Consistent Holder Growth](https://preview.redd.it/gkqcsrznxxae1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=f74e835cccd70b5e7e2e5fed404022fb332c5989)

I am a level 64 player, and here is my tier list of buildings based on my experience so far. I hope this helps some people who ask ""which machine should I buy"". I am not looking forward to the millions of coins coming up for the machines in levels 70s.

**Some special mentions on some of the machines:**

- **Honey Extractor:** I love this machine, and the different mechanic of harvesting beeswax compared to other items. Peanuts do not hit the same way though.
    
- **Sewing Machine:** You get a ton of expensive items with this, including the Blanket. Plus it has an interesting dynamic with the Loom.
    
- **Smelter:** Objectively, you can buy 2 or 3 and be set for a long time. I like it a lot and personally have all 5 of them, which made it easier to 3-start the machine too.
    
- **Coffee Kiosk:** I love coffee. But the machine is not... great. Very short production times is a big hurdle.
    
- **Flower Shop:** Such. A. Trap. Don't even bother with it until level 65 where you unlock the second item.
    
- **Sushi / Salad / Sandwich Buildings:** Takes a lot of really valuable items to produce pretty mediocre items at best, just an unnecessary challenge.
    

If you are interested I can share the template format and expand it to include all the machines!",1,1735982976.0,HayDay,1,1.0,False

Now early in to 2025, the crypto market is on the verge of the greatest alt season ever seen.  
  
More specifically, a ‚Äúmemecoin supercycle‚Äù as labelled by much of CT.  
  
It happened in 2017 and 2021. The alt seasons gave rise to events such as Shib exploding in 2021, where it saw a rise from 22m to 22B in only 36 days around April that year.  
  
Standing now on the precipice of crypto greatness once again, there lay ahead of us an opportunity for many established communities to take this cycle all the way to the top, just like Shib.  
  
The foundation laid in 2024 and early 2025 is what will determine success during the imminent alt season. Communities with conviction and belief, ones that inspire, provide a sense of belonging and give motivation to those who participate.

  
**Why Kendu is in pole position to win this cycle** 

  
Launched in Feb of 2024, Kendu has now seen 10+ months of proof of life and establishment.  
  
With constant growth, engagement and awareness spreading of the Kendu name, it has been our mission to ensure we are in pole position to capture the decabillions this cycle.  
  
We have grown day in and day out, 10 months after launch, which means that we are here to stay and there is genuinely only one way now for us to go - up. 2024 was a year comprised of foundation building and community development, experiencing the necessary periods of redistribution and growth that are essential for any organic memecoin to hit the billions.  


\*The community is so large and so decentralized that it is hard to capture all the alpha in one post, so i strongly recommend you read through the x article link located at the bottom of this post.\*

**2024 Achievements**  
  
In the early days of Kendu we saw Shytoshi, the Shib dev, messaging within our TG and offering words of encouragement. He follows our doxxed dev, Miazaki, and the main Kendu page as well. In fact, he is so linked to our dev he even placed us on Shib mag.

[Shib Mag](https://preview.redd.it/6ab1v0yq3yae1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74e605cde34e8e1d49c788dd540f1fdf1daf3f1)

Kendu is not a community to remain in the shadow of another, though. We aim to cast our own shadow and to take the number 1 spot.

  
Recognising that community is the ultimate driver of success for a memecoin, we have cultivated a perpetual culture of hard work and an unparalleled sense of unity under our motto: ""We do not gamble, we work.""

  
This dedication has propelled us to achieve an ATH of $280M mc in a pre-bull run market‚Äîan impressive feat rarely seen during that period last year.

Our success has been entirely organic, with no reliance on paid KOLs or paid marketing, as we understand it only leads to pump-and-dumps. This approach has fostered consistent and sustained growth in our social presence and holders.

Even during the huge market dips, shakeouts and massive Eth drops of the last 10 months, our holders have never seen a decrease.

[Consistent Holder Growth](https://preview.redd.it/7rfm7j5t3yae1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3bc9ddb291b9f44b67784cf5db3177c9ea27b2)

We have over doubled our holders now since ATH, and are holding a concrete floor of 30M that is consolidating nicely. This redistribution period is not unusual either, with most other memecoins in the billions experiencing periods eerily similar before their legs up. This has also led now to the top 100 holders owning 51.37% (at time of writing) of supply - incredibly healthy and bullish for any memecoin, especially one at this level.

This redistribution period is not unusual either, with most other memecoins in the billions experiencing periods eerily similar before their legs up. This has also led now to the top 100 holders owning 51.37% (at time of writing) of supply - incredibly healthy and bullish for any memecoin, especially one at this level.  
  
To then demonstrate our social media presence, taken directly from grok:  
  
""Moreover, posts on social media highlight $KENDU's community as being miles ahead in terms of engagement and activity, positioning it as a leader in community-driven momentum for the upcoming year. This is further supported by specific figures showing a rise in engagements and mentions, with a reported increase of 48.07 million engagements and 412.85 thousand mentions.""

412.85 thousand mentions of the Kendu name. We dominate every single poll, we win all the raids we participate in and we consistently get engagement that is unseen.

[Community](https://preview.redd.it/dhkste7v3yae1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0648a124ad739ce2b6aec51b1fc642b9230b91)

We know social media isnt the only way to get the name out there though. IRL is the Kendu way. We have countless community members daily, handing out flyers, placing stickers, shilling to friends and their networks and utilising their skills to ensure the world knows Kendu.

we now even have under our belt genuine products such as our energy drinks and coffee.

[Energy drinks and Coffee](https://preview.redd.it/tpyj3xpw3yae1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab85ae96e7dc54781e00cab09ca8f5189fd1c4cb)

Thats in addition to our gum, hot sauce, jewellery and merchandise - with so much more in the pipeline. 

Our community in general has established a convicted and driven approach to the Kendu name, with many of our community members essentially living and breathing it.

so much conviction in fact, that we have 12 community tattoos.

We instil in every new holder our ethos and methods and so often they come back with statements along the lines of ""I have never ever seen a community like this""

You go in to any TG - no one is as active as us.

Of course with a community like this, it then leads to success elsewhere.

* We had the largest NFT mint of the last 2 years
* Our dev has given away of 200K + USD to community members for challenges and also out of the kindness of his heart for dedicated community members
* We have 15 Cex listings, a sol bridge on the way, and another listing on Indias biggest exchange incoming

We have also just completed our Certik audit - the second memcoin EVER to complete the 50 000 votes organically, only behind Pepe. With this audit - it proves we are unruggable and here to stay.

Not only that, we are also only 1 of 2 existing memecoins right now who have our own dedicated stocktwits page.

We then even get mentioned and noticed by several T1 CEXs such as Coinbase, OKX and Bitget.

Only a couple days ago Coinbase for the second time posted us, this time now on their main page.

2024 was a year to be remembered for Kendu. This is only a scratch on the surface though for our achievements so far.

Read these 6 articles for a detailed summary: [https://x.com/kojak797/status/1873184989518680313](https://x.com/kojak797/status/1873184989518680313?s=46&t=x-AVnqahJsjZkoYGfqo2qg)

The Kendu community is simply unmatched. No one does IRL, branding, engagement or conviction like us.

We are placing ourselves in absolute perfect position for this alt season and it is evidenced why. It would be unwise to not dip the toes in even slightly, for us succeeding this year is inevitable.

We are running it up just like Shib did. The Kendu name is beginning to be known globally and it is only a matter of time until the marketcap catches up to our actual value.

Join the Kendu movement, anon. We are an unstoppable force who will never stop.

I dont sleep and when I do it's a nap either after school or when its daylight. I feel like a really fucked up vampire.

Hypervigilence is a major part but I also think I'm subconsciously trying to avoid REM sleep so I don't have the horrible deep-sleep nightmares that I have to fight to wake up from. Its not really affecting me school-wise but I NEED coffee or I take long naps from breakfast to dinner. Is there literally anything I can do? I would go to the doctor but I dont know how my mom would feel about it. Should I be worried? I know caffeine is bad and im not getting enough sleep but (to my knowledge) nothing is working.

At the start of our dating period we were not exclusive. We talked about it and it was okay. She handled on it and I did not but I was okay with that. Since our relationship no cheating had happened. Though, after we got exclusive I got to know that the person she still slept with was her guy best friend. This is a person she now still talks to pretty much everyday and they are meeting up today to go do a hobby they share. At this point in time I‚Äôm more and more struggling with our dating period and that she slept with someone so close in her circle while we were dating. I would‚Äôve understood a ONS but not someone she told me she was gonna meet for a coffee and then sleep with whilst messaging me that she could not wait to see me again the day after.

Furthermore, she was always complaining about a guy seeking attention and that she despised the guy during our dating phase. When we were in a relationship I learned that he ‚Äòapparently turned out to be a pretty nice guy‚Äô went gymming together and slept together once. 

It just feels different for me due to it being so close and she still daily speaking with that guy and that she told me she missed me in the deed and the other guy she was hating on to me at first. 

Is it weird for me to still feel bad about this? I‚Äôm thinking of putting an ultimatum on that guy best friend. Either me or him, I know guys, he is looking for a crack in the door and I just feel uneasy when I know she is messaging daily with a past fwb, even when I am there sometimes.

So I (25F) on my local subreddit saw a post of a girl (24F) who actually lives in my town. In that post she was looking for advices about why she doesn't have any friends, and she complained about how people IRL in college, school always ignore her and she never had any real friend. She said she is also having hard time connecting with girls in our town because she has specific interests and hobbies and that she likes ,,intelectual'' people and she find most girls her age boring. Tbh she did sounded little bit like ,,pick me'' girl, but I had some intuition that we may get along. I jumped into her dm, I appologised if I interrupt, and said that I have same problem. We exchanged few messages where I sensed that we may hit it off so I ask her number to get to know eachother better. We chatted about everyting for like 2 days, she asked questions also seemed interested and also we found out we have same hobby and similar taste in movies etc. After 2 days or intense conversation I asked if we could maybe meet for a coffee , because I don't see a point in texting with some stranger 24/7 when she may live few blocks from my place and we are both lonely and bored. Btw in the beginning of conversation she said that she is really careful about meeting people online etc, so to calm her down I gave her my instagram where is tons of my photos and she could get good impression of who I am. Anyways when I asked to meet IRL she just said that she is now busy but why not some day, I said that I understand, no problems. And she suddenly withdraws and ghosted me. 

Tbh I am little dissapointed because I also really want to make new friends and give people chance but I often feel rejected. With my friends irl I often felt like I was the one making effort and others are not really interested in me. But she did sounded interested through texts so I don't understand why not to ,,take a risk'' when we have things in common? I am not some man with hidden agenda or smth so Idk why would she be afraid to meet me. Have I maybe come too strong? Maybe she needed more time to get to know me through texts before meet up? Did I maybe sound clingy and desperate? 

I wanted to maybe politely ask her did I say something ,,wrong'' because I really felt like we clicked, but I don't want to sound deperate and weird and needy, so I will just leave it like this.

1htaqj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/prettyprivilege/comments/1htaqj9/an_honest_reflection_on_pretty_privilege_a_double/,An honest reflection on pretty privilege- a double edged sword ,"This might come across as self-absorbed to some, but it‚Äôs an honest account from a woman who has come to understand that, whether for better or worse, life experiences under the radar of ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù are more complex than they seem.

Growing up, I was shaped by two worlds‚Äîmy mother‚Äôs artistic flair and my father‚Äôs athleticism. This blend gave me a wide range of interests, which, from a young age, made me stand out. Yet, standing out came with its challenges. I never felt like I had a middle ground. The treatment I received‚Äîwhether overly positive or outright negative‚Äîalways seemed extreme.

By the time I was 14, I began facing the darker side of this privilege. Creepy behavior from older men, unsolicited comments about my clothing, and ridiculing remarks from other women made me feel like something was inherently wrong with me. For years, I struggled to form meaningful female friendships. I felt judged, excluded, and often betrayed for no clear reason. The anxiety this caused was overwhelming.

But as I grew older, I realized something: my day-to-day life and certain accomplishments came with a kind of ease that others might not experience. I didn‚Äôt fully understand it at first, but it was clear this ease stemmed from what society calls ‚Äúpretty privilege.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs address the uncomfortable truth: women supporting women is often conditional. Many times, women only support others who don‚Äôt threaten their self-esteem. I‚Äôve been told by those closest to me‚Äîfriends I trusted‚Äîthat I wasn‚Äôt good enough for my dreams or that my successes were purely based on my looks. This wasn‚Äôt just hurtful; it shattered my confidence.

A pivotal moment of clarity came recently. Living far from home, I planned a day out with my best friend who is also my housemate. We went for pre-drinks before heading to a venue, and a couple of guys struck up a conversation with me. I wasn‚Äôt interested and politely disengaged because I wanted to focus on my friend. What followed stunned me. She abruptly ended our plans, saying she didn‚Äôt want to continue. When I pressed her, she admitted she felt insecure and wondered why she hadn‚Äôt received the same attention at the bar.

While I appreciated her honesty, the experience stung. To avoid making her feel inferior, I started dimming my light‚Äîwearing PJs outside, keeping my hair untidy, and dressing down. But nothing prepared me for what happened next.

Christmas was approaching, and I was excited to finally visit my family after so long. I packed my bags with all of these cute lil gifts that I bought for my family after working day in and out over the past few months. I enter my room to grab my passport which mind you- I had kept it on my bedside table in the morning‚Äîjust vanished.  Yes it disappeared into thin air. I had seen it an hour back and left the house for a cup of coffee so I was certain that it can‚Äôt just fly on its own which is why I searched every corner of the house‚Äîyes, even the microwave. It was gone. My worst fears materialized as my supposed best friend sat on the couch with a smirk, telling me to reschedule my flight because I‚Äôd never find it. She knew how much I longed to see my family and just how happy I was. What had happened would completely shatter me undoubtedly because the next few days were sleepless nights, anger and panic attacks for me. Was this the only way I could be brought down..I wondered? Yes I could be wrong too maybe she didn‚Äôt do it at all but the course of events didn‚Äôt sit right with me especially after she had confessed few days prior to me just how insecure she feels in my presence. And I was really proud of her for wearing her heart on her sleeve but if this did happen then how will I ever be able to trust anyone in my life and so I just took this entire situation with a brisk of salt and blamed myself for leaving my passport on my bedside table in my very own house. Haha funny. I know. So‚Äî-
This post is for anyone who relates to this experience. Pretty privilege isn‚Äôt just about glitter and gold‚Äîit comes with isolation, invalidation, and loneliness. We‚Äôre constantly told that our struggles are less valid because of how we look. We‚Äôre told, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine‚Äîyou‚Äôre pretty!‚Äù as if that erases every hardship we face.

Friendships often become exhausting because they‚Äôre measured on scales of envy and competition. We try not to outshine others, yet our light becomes a source of discomfort. In relationships, we‚Äôre objectified, lusted over, and, too often, not truly loved. Men either show us off as trophies or reject us the moment we reveal our vulnerabilities. And if we succeed professionally, people dismiss our hard work, attributing it solely to appearance.

But here‚Äôs the truth: you don‚Äôt need to dim your light to make others feel brighter. Shine unapologetically. Wear your confidence proudly, even if it makes others uncomfortable.

To everyone who feels this way: you‚Äôre not alone. Being pretty comes with a price, but your worth isn‚Äôt diminished by others‚Äô insecurities. Keep shining, dear girl, because you deserve to take up space in this world‚Äîfully and confidently.

5. What‚Äôs the deal with physical gestures? Is holding hands okay on a first date? Should I bring flowers, or is that too much?

Landlords already raising their rent as the new year stated, supermarkets/grocery stores increasing prices, businesses already raising prices because of 'Trump tariffs', restaurants raising prices because the rent increased and food ingredients increased, everything going up and up while your $35/hr job stays the same.

$35/hr is 'nothing' these days. I had to stop driving and sold my car to put money into stock investments. Yeah, it's going good so far with investing, but I don't want to sell any of my investments until I'm like 60 years old or in extreme emergency cases. However, the rapid increase of prices is making me put less and less into investing.

I've already stopped eating out and buying coffee/drinks outside. Heck, you will only see me eating at a restaurant like once every couple of months, but even then, it's a casual-dining restaurant. It is so rare for me to spend money outside on food/drinks that my total cost for 2024 on outside dining/drinking amounted to only $173 for the whole year. 

Then here comes the landlord increasing rent by 4% that will take effect after my current contract ends soon. That's more money being taken out of my paycheck to go to rent and not towards my investments. 

I look online on ways to make money, but it's always 'start a business' or learn 'skills' that gives you a lot of money. 

Like damn seriously? Are we all supposed to start businesses now???? Are we all supposed to learn the same skills that pays a lot of money???? And if you don't do it, you get called a 'wage slave'.

Long gone are the days where you can just work one job with a college degree and not worry about bills and rent because you are making ENOUGH money.

For fucks sake, I'm not trying to be a millionaire. I just want to have ENOUGH throughout my days of living until I die. 

But nah. Apparently, people get offended by that thought. They get MAD that you want to work only one job and have a 'living wage'. They say shit like 'you don't deserve it'. Why? Why is it all of a sudden a fucking offense to have someone working one job and being paid a living wage that raises up as inflation goes up? ",1,1735982148.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a F Aqua (please don't judge) who‚Äôs developed deep feelings for a F Scorpio colleague. She‚Äôs only dated men before, but there have been many moments that make me wonder if she feels the same way about me. Here‚Äôs the backstory:

Before we became friends, she used to stare at me intensely, often holding deep eye contact. She‚Äôs the one who initiated our friendship, and early on, I invited her out for what was essentially a date (though not officially one) over coffee. It was magical, but afterward, she pulled away, seeming scared or overwhelmed. About 4-5 months later, she started getting closer again, and since then, we‚Äôve built a strong and meaningful friendship.

Some signs that confuse me:

1. She once casually mentioned, almost as an offhand comment, that someone interested in her wouldn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs currently dating a man or a woman. It wasn‚Äôt a direct statement about being open to dating women but made me wonder about the possibility.

2. She treats me differently from her other friends‚Äîmore gentle and reserved, while with others, she‚Äôs more playful and casual.

3. When I recently left the job, I sent her a message hinting at my deep feelings without being too direct. She replied that the feelings were mutual (though she didn‚Äôt say anything explicitly romantic). When I left, she initiated a long, intense hug that felt electrifying, and it was clear she was deeply affected by my departure.

4. Throughout this period, especially since our coffee date, her behavior has often been hot and cold. Sometimes she‚Äôs very warm, thoughtful, and attentive, and other times she pulls back or seems more distant, which leaves me unsure of where I stand.

5. There‚Äôs a very strong, almost spiritual connection between us, and I‚Äôm certain she feels it too.

I‚Äôve always thought she wanted to build our friendship slowly, deepening the bond until she felt safe enough to open up to something romantic. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve given her time, and it‚Äôs worked‚Äîwe‚Äôve grown closer over the last five months. But with my departure, everything feels unsettled now. I‚Äôm scared we might drift apart over time, and the chance for a romantic relationship could slip away, especially if her intention was to take things slow and test the waters with me.

I‚Äôm torn between waiting to see if our connection stays strong (even though we won‚Äôt see each other daily, maybe just once a month), or confessing my feelings now to see if it sparks something.

He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.

I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.

After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning.

I didn‚Äôt receive any texts so I text him yesterday 

heres the update after I just texted him:

me = ""when do you think we can see each other again, I really liked you""

him = good morning, yes we will arrange something again, do you plan on coming to scotland again soon?

me = no plans

him = i can come over to you. possibly around march, got a few things here to do first

me = ok thats good id really like to see you if you come

1htao1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1htao1y/nightmare_experience_with_zoloft/,Nightmare experience with zoloft,"Apologies for this being so long, I just want to include all the backstory.

Hello, I am 20F and in July began Zoloft. My doctor started me on 50mg on a monday, and wanted me on a schedule of every 2 days upping by 50mg to eventually get to 200mg in like a week. My very first night of taking it i woke up at 3 am sweating profusely, and I felt so exhausted the next day that I genuinly was asleep for longer than I was awake. I had constant muscle tremors, was constantly hot to the point that 2 large fans on me wasnt enough, couldn't stop yawning, was grinding my teeth so bad I had to buy a mouth guard, and my hair was falling out in clumps. I called my doctor and she said this was normal because my body was adjusting to it, and put off me upping my dose.

I went in once a month for several months, consistantly telling her I was having horrible side effects, especially when she would up my dose, and she brushed me off. every. single. time. And constantly reminded me that she wanted me to get up to 200mg eventually.

Whenever someone would ask me if I thought they were working I genuinly wouldnt have an answer because I did not know. All that I could feel were the side effects.

It took me about 5 months to get up to 200mg, I was on it for about a week before I completely crashed and started having the same symptoms as when I first started. I slept the entire day and my mom called the doctors out of concern, chewed out a poor nurse, and ended up getting me an over the phone consultation. When I listed out my symptoms, she audibly went ""Oh, thats not good."" Like it was some shock that the symptoms I'd ben feeling on and off again for months were somehow NOW a cause for concern. She told me to start going down by 50mg every 3 days until I was done and I was more than happy to comply because I felt so awful.

I learned about seratonin syndrome through a damn TIKTOK that same day because I was searching about what going off of zoloft would be like. Currently I have been fully off of zoloft for about a week. I have had constant vertigo, Im too scared to drive because of it, I slept for 10 hours straight during the DAY then fully slept through the night, Im getting ""brain zaps"", muscle tremors, and I am overall just absolutely miserable.

I started researching what a normal protocol for starting/stopping zoloft is, and from what I have read, my doctor has done just about everything wrong. I just dont know how to approach this anymore. They did not take a single one of my concerns seriously until they got as bad as they did, I was not properly introduced or taken off of the medication, I am literally getting brain zaps as I am trying to write this. I can say I WILL be attempting to switch doctors because fuck this.

**My main question** is how am I supposed to feel better or at least manage these withdrawals from zoloft to be able to function like a normal human being. Its been over 2 weeks of feeling like this and I dont want to just 'wait it out'. I tried an anti vertigo thing that you dab behind your ear and it almost instantly made me feel worse. I've started taking vitamin D supplements because apparently thats supposed to help with vertigo as well. I've been trying my best to stay as hydrated as possible. I barely have enough energy to even get out of bed to go to the bathroom. Every website's advice has not been helping or doesn't apply to me. I just feel like I am at a complete loss and extremly frustrated. I dont drink, I dont smoke, I dont even drink coffee, and I havent done anything of the sort while on the meds as well as now that I am off them.

**Edit for context:** I started Zoloft to help with my PMDD, which from experience, it absoulty did not help and made it worse some months.",1,1735981982.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

It happened again this morning: ""ohhhh, new upgrade. 2025.01, sexy"" proceed to read the release notes, get excited about something, read the breaking changes (nothing there for me), hit the update button. 

After the reboot, one or many integrations start throwing errors. Fml, there goes the morning. This time is my waste collection schedule thing (apparently ICS scheduling is broken, generally speaking) 

Is there a way I can have a sensor or something that tells me the current number of new github problems opened for the integrations (both native and hacs) I have? 

I know I could eventually do it, after much reading and tinkering with some templates but I am sure there is something out there ready to be used. 

Plan is to quickly check and read the new issues in the last 12 hours to verify they are not related to the new upgrade and thus saving me a morning or evening full of coffee and anger at not waiting 

So whatever the solution is, it should show me only the integrations I have with new reported problems (best case scenario timestamp newer than the release of the update, but 12 hours would work just as well too) 

I thought spook, being the jack of all trades it is, could do something like this, but it can't

Kirkland French Roast beans, handheld blade grinder that I run for about 9-10 seconds, stainless steel kettle I set to boil on the stove. It does not have the long spout, it's actually a big open short spout. And I brew my stuff strong. Like, the pour over is fairly close to full of grounds. I'd say about 3/4. I'm very insistent on strong, hot, dark, filtered coffee. (Plus cold milk and brown sugar.)

Have people had this problem with their PO just getting waterlogged and stopping all drips after a bit?

In the past I had issues with an excessively fine grind, so I cut back on that. Also situations where I was stirring the grounds and I would scrape the bottom of the filter. Then the thing tears, the water crashes down and lots of grounds go into the decanter. Other bad situations where I shifted the whole filter/grounds/water by moving the filter edge a big to try to adjust... and another crash-out.

I make sure the slurry does not actually go over the edge of the filter.

But even controlling for these, it still got slow with filtering down until I slid a spoon between the side of the filter and the ceramic. That gave it enough room to actually drain down. Like this was a suction problem or something.

1htafm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1htafm9/passed_atatat_and_some_thoughts/,Passed AT/AT/AT and some thoughts,"I recently passed the exam and wanted to share how I prepared, hoping this can be helpful for someone.

I started this journey quite some time ago but only began focusing intensively during the last month before the exam. In my opinion, if you can dedicate 2‚Äì3 hours per day for a month, or compress your study time into two weeks with more daily hours, you should have enough time to pass. Don‚Äôt over-prepare or schedule the exam too far in advance. This advice assumes you already have some real-world experience and are an average or above-average test taker.

Here‚Äôs how I prepared for the exam:

1.	Udemy course: I used this to earn the 35 PDUs required to apply for the exam. I didn‚Äôt get much value from it, though.

2.	Third3Rock‚Äôs notes: I read the full version. It‚Äôs excellent for understanding key concepts, but the flow and organization could be better.

3.	DM‚Äôs videos: I watched the entire series on Agile, the PMBOK 6th and 7th editions, and the drag-and-drop videos. These were great for learning how to analyze questions and summarizing key concepts. However, I found most of them to be a bit too easy compared to the real exam.

4.	AR‚Äôs videos: I watched a few but preferred DM‚Äôs videos, so I focused solely on those.

5.	Study Hall: I completed all five full-length exams and most of the mini exams. My initial score, without any prior studying, was around 55%. Closer to the exam date, I was scoring between 75‚Äì80%. I found Study Hall‚Äôs questions to be more similar to the real exam. Make sure to thoroughly understand the rationale behind the answers.

6.	Mindsets: While many people recommend focusing on mindsets, I didn‚Äôt rely on them much. For me, understanding the core concepts and applying common sense worked well. That said, mindsets seem to be helpful for most people, so I‚Äôd recommend learning them if you can.

The exam itself was challenging but not overly difficult compared to other certifications I‚Äôve taken. I used the entire allotted time, and spent quite some time to review and finalize the questions I had marked for reviewing. Taking the two scheduled breaks to hydrate and use the washroom was helpful. I also had some coffee and an energy drink beforehand to stay focused, though that might have been overkill.

1htacms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Secretill/comments/1htacms/the_menagerie/,The Menagerie,"My mind often comes back to childhood memories, things that could never be real are vividly imprinted in my mind and etched into my soul. Pale withered arms reaching out with their elongated fingers, surfacing from a well, slowly creeping closer to a bird perched on the rim til the rotting fingers wrap around it in an instant. A silhouette of a man 7 feet tall, with red eyes staring at me beyond the doorway of my room, his breathing labored as each exhale sounded like there was popcorn popping in his throat. I can recall even in the dark the man seemed darker than everything around him, as if his shape was cut out of the space he resided in. A monster looming over me as I woke up on the schoolbus, being unable to move a muscle, it's mouth agape with sharpened teeth, readying itself to swallow me whole, lifeless eyes staring into my soul as my eyes spin in my skull looking for someone to help me. Sitting in a classroom during a lecture while worm like creatures pierce through the walls, some slimy substance falling off themselves as they push through.

 There are so many of these memories that revolve in my mind that I could never write them all, but even when they had woken me up in a cold sweat with nail marks indented in the skin of my palms I could still believe it was all just a bad dream, caused by an overly stimulated imagination of a child. How I wish I could still think of them as nightmares and childhood terrors, conjurings of a cursed imagination. It all had to be fake, they were nothing but childhood fears, so they surely would never rear their ugly faces once more and I felt relief in that thought. I'm sure most children had seen things that go bump in the night, or at least felt it was there, such as a monster under the bed waiting for your foot to drop down to drag your body under, but as a child grows up such things leave their minds as wild fantasies that reality would never glance at, and they usually are just that. A cruel fate has taken this thought that gave my mind reprieve and solace from those recollections, and now something that is not myself compels me to write this wretched story no matter how well I try to resist and plead for my hands to halt. If pressing a blade to my throat and slicing would stop this torment it would have been done yet they stop me, they bind me here, shackling my body to a place I once called my refuge, all this place appears as now is my prison and personal hell. There are strings sewn into the fibres of my muscles propelling me towards an inevitable end, any resistance is met with overwheling strength by the pupetteer. Even now hot breath is on the nape of my neck, something is closely watching everything I do, it acts as if it wants to be seen, that it wants affirmation from my eyes yet it doesn't allow myself to do such a thing. I haven't seen what is behind me, the moment my body whips around theres still a cold breath on my nape. The creature feels familiar, maybe it just wants to be in my mind, I think they all do, maybe it's goal is to drive me insane, maybe it observes for the others, any guess would be pure conjecture, and there is a feeling in the depths of my soul that the real reason it stands behind is worse than any theory crafted by my mind. I'm not used to these arrangements, yet even after a few days of this insanity the exhaustion of my mind has considerably dulled the fear that was held in my heart when all this started. 

I was finally happy you know? Most of my life was experienced in solitude, connections with people were daunting, but life had started to appear less grim in my eyes. A ray of light entered this life of mine from a chance encounter when we bumped into each other while I was at work, one thing led to another and we went on a date. A date turned into two, then three, then more than I could count. We got along well, she was able to put up with my quirks, and she was someone even a freak like me could be comfortable around, the feeling of comfort she radiated was never experienced even from my own family. Everything was a wonderful dream in which there would be no want to wake up from, yet that light vanished, dissapeared in a heart beat, it's when my everything was ripped away, all the meat of my life and soul flayed off by a malevolent force. Some things aren't explainable, have you ever seen something so out of place that you are utterly baffled by what you see? And if you were to see something your mind couldn't comprehend what would you do? The answer for myself became painfully obvious to me now, I would just stare, unmoving, speechless... My wife and I were having a midnight walk like we often had, it wasn't dangerous where we lived, and we enjoyed the scent of the midnight air, the contrast to the day making it ever more alluring. There was something calming about the empty roads illuminated by street lamps, all the lights of houses and most signs of life gone to rest, my hand in hers as we chatted about whatever we could come up with, and never seeming to run out of topics to discuss. That night was supposed to be like any other night, it was going as excpected until we saw the newly built playground in our neighborhood. 

In the dark there were children, from their stature they looked to be no older than 8 years, as they played on the equipment I could hear little quiet laughs echoing around, the laughter felt close like it was in my skull, yet also distant. At that time what the children were doing alludes me as they were not what my eyes had affixed themselves to at the time. Something difficult to describe filled my vision, even now a splitting headache surfaces when trying to remember, but my will alone is not enough to supress this ardent desire to write which isn't my own. The being had the shape of a large deformed dog, at least that was the shape of its silhouette, it was illuminated by a street light yet even under the light its shape seemed to be constantly shifting, its shadow was the only thing that stayed consistent. The creature was so black it absorbed almost all light save for one feature that reflected all back, a white mask on the creatures head, there were black ovals on the ivory mask that only emphasized the empty voidlike sockets where eyes should have been. I would have observed it for longer in utter awe but the feeling of my wifes hand slipping from mine brought me back into conciousness. She asked me what I was staring at, my mind was stunned, she had no clue what horrid being beyond comprehension stood before us, how could she not see something that towers over us, that makes the air itself around it dense and cold. Speech refused to exit my mouth to answer her question, it was like my voice was desperate to hide from what lurked outside. She told me she wanted to ask the kids on the playground what they were doing out at night like this, oh how I wanted to stop her, I wanted to scream at her to run, or to grab her hand and take her back to our home pretending this was all a bad dream, however what I wanted to do had no bearing on what my body would do. This body of mine stood motionless, there was cement on my feet and hands as well as a muzzle on my mouth, and something akin to a scratchy liquid filling my throat. 

I watched in terror as she walked into the field, my eyes gazed ahead and saw the children once more, or what should have been children, upon closer inspection their bodies weren't alive, their bones were broken and jutting out in grotesque ways, and their skin was rotting away turning into a rancid black sludge yet still sticking to the bones. The kids played on the equipment as their joints moved in unnatural directions, I frantically looked at my wife who kept moving closer and closer to them hoping she would sense something amiss and fall back to me. Thinking back on it now they were so far away and my vision was never that good, their appearence shouldn't have been known to me, it was as if imagery of them were engraved in my minds eye, worming its way into a place where it could dwell. My wife moving towards them had me momentarily forget the biggest threat and when it came back to the forefront of my mind panic overwhelmed me more than it had ever done before, moving the only thing I could move I looked at the creature hoping, no praying, that it would ignore who was walking near it, to my horror it was staring intently at my wife. Black substance dripped from the bottom of the mask like slobber, large drips fell to the ground but there wasn't any splash. I don't want to recall this, I don't want to remember, why must I recall this wretched memory, why must I continue to write what seems like the tales of a man gone mad, what occured is something I wish I could have forgotten and have whisky take my mental faculties away, then next a bullet to provide permanent reprieve. If memory had been taken from me like the others, I may have felt dead but it wouldn't have been as soul crushing as the curse of remembrance. The creature began to move towards my wife, the children stopped their act of merrily playing and stared at her with their empty sockets as she slowly approached them. They were like the call of a siren beckoning my beloved closer and closer, all to feed whatever the creature in the grass was. The dog like creature sped up in an instant, it barrelled towards my wife and all that could be done was to watch in utter terror, with screams of warning wanting to exit my lungs with such ardor that it felt my lungs were bursting, but my mouth was only left agape without the exit of a single breath. The white mask cracked and gaped open, with only a void where its gullet should have been, the creature moved at an ungodly speed where it became just a smear in my vision... then her being was no more, vanished as if she was never there to begin with. Everything felt futile, I couldn't even move, my eyes had to watch who I cared for most be devoured, as not even my fingers could move. A feeling of faintness came upon me thereafter, I don't know if the creature caused it or if it was the shock, but the thudding sound of my body when it hit the ground and a crack echoed in my mind as I faded from conciousness.

 When my eyes had opened up, sticking to sandman dust that was on my eyelids, it became apparent to my horror that it was now day. Jolting up with eyes wide it became known to me that the creature and children were gone, my body no longer held down by an invisible force lept up and darted to the playground for anything that mightve been dropped or would have given a sliver of a clue as to what happened last night. The amount of time that passed searching for clues gone and went into the blue, I combed through the grass, checked every piece of equipment and even dug through the sand for hours, some people passing by gave me strange looks but it didn't matter. The place where the creature under the light stood had nothing either, there was not a hint of its existence, the grass didn't even look disturbed by something that should have had enough weight to leave dents in the ground. My face was buried in my hands as I thought of what to do next, how could I explain what occured to anyone, it'd be like the ramblings of some crazy, maybe if they heard my explanation they'd think it was me who had killed her, then it would be an impossibility to find her. So many thoughts rushed into my head, they were loud, deafening, my next step eluded me. Laughter bellowed out of me, all the fear and anxiety had me in hysterics, it felt like something snapped in my mind and an overwhelming sense of shame overcame me for laughing in such a situation. Tears streamed down my cheeks as the laughter continued, what kind of cruel joke was this when life finally began to have meaning. My lungs burnt and my vision blurred from the fit of laughter, my head felt light as I collapsed once more. My eyes opened and my head felt fuzzy, it was a moment of bliss in ignorance before memories rushed back to me and remembering almost sent me into another fit. Sitting in the sand of the playground for some time my mind attempted to process all the nonsensical information in what I had hoped to be a calm manner. I wanted to call the police but the chance of that succesfully working seemed so slim, so the only thing that seemed reasonable was to go home, then I'd try to contact someone. I walked down the streets, my head cast down in shame as I followed the path we walked together only last night, my body swayed back and forth like a drunkard, and almost all vigor had left me. The house was almost within reach after some time, the thoughts of last night replaying in my mind the entire way. The effort to move my body up the steps of the house was monumental, a momentary thought slipped into my mind as I slid my key into the door, imagining that she would be waiting there, wondering why her husband was wearing such a downcast expression, she'd offer her open arms for an embrace to cure whatever disease was in my mind. Yet when the door clicked and opened, it was dark with the curtains shut from last night, and not a soul was present. 

I pressed the switch by the doorway and the lights flickered to life, my head scanned around and something in my mind registered everything was off. The first thing that had caught my attention was the color of the walls. Rubbing my eyes and opening them once more only showed me the same image that I thought must have been a trick of the light. Moving closer to a wall by the door my hands pressed against it, it was cool to the touch, the paint was dry, it couldn't of been new but it made no sense if it wasn't. When my wife and I had purchased the house she had wanted to spruce up the place, we painted the walls a bluish gray, she spent weeks deciding on the color, the matter of what color the house should be never seemed that important to me but she was so adamant on picking just the right one and it was a pleasent time seeing her so excited. We spent a good few weekends painting the entire house after her decision on the color. I can still recall the blunder that I made when doing cutting, when she saw she told me it would just add a bit of character to the house that would have us recall this moment. That slight barely noticeable mistake that held so much importance was now gone, without a trace. Those fond times with her still revolved in my mind, yet when I stared at the walls of my home all I saw was a white that made me sick, it was as if what we had done never even occured. Moving around the house led to more discoveries of subtle and direct changes, our portrait from a street artist wasn't hanging in the hallway, her curling iron wasn't sitting ontop of the bathroom counter, a side of the bed was missing her stuffed toys, there were so many inconsistencies that it made a chill run down my spine and question if I even went into the right house. The feeling of unease crept up on me, it was my abode, yet everything changed to the point where it felt like rummaging around in a strangers place. 

My head was full of thoughts and it all felt jumbled, it was pointless looking anymore so I made my way to the living room for my body and mind to have a breather. The couch was different too, but too many thoughts were already revolving around that the thought slipped away as quickly as it entered. My head leaned back on the cushion and just stared at the ceiling. Even the ceiling was different, the popcorn roof which we had removed was back once more, it really seemed that any evidence of her living in this house vanished into thin air. I stayed seated on that couch for so long, wondering what could be done in this situation which reality should have never humored. Thoughts slowly began to organize, and my first action was decided, I wanted to talk to her parents, they knew me, they would believe me. Reaching my hands into my pocket I pulled out my phone, the screen apparently cracked from the fall in the field, a slight feeling of annoyance bubbled up when I went to press my finger to the screen and it caused my finger to bleed. Ignoring the new blood on the phone I pressed on the phone icon at the bottom bar, the app opened but it was effected like the house, her parents numbers were removed from my phone as well as many others. Looking at the list of contacts I noticed her number was gone as well. Another knot tied itself in my stomach when I saw her contact completely missing, panicking I dialed her number but all I had gotten was a response saying the number wasn't in use. Frustration kept piling onto me and things kept looking bleaker, my phone moved through the air before my mind had even registered that I had thrown it, it made a thud as it hit the floor. The feeling of needing to talk about her to someone rushed like a tidal wave, there must be someone to contact, however most of my connections were from her, and they all had seemed to be gone without a trace, blank spaces on my screen where their names used to be were the only things remaining. 

Sitting there in silence I racked my brain to try and find a solution, maybe there was a simple solution that I was overlooking, ideas rushed in my head until an epiphany came. It would be hard to contact someone, but if they were in a place I already would go to it would be easy to meet them. At that moment it became clear what my next move would be, my wife often spent time with a coworker of mine, if I just met with her tomorrow I could see if the rearrangement of my house and phone were the only things that changed. It was naive to think it was just the house and my device that were altered, but I was so desperately clinging to anything that would create even a thread of hope, a lifeline out of this situation from hell. There was nothing else I could do waiting for the next day to come, wanting that day to come more than anything I decided to try and rest. My feet dragged along the floor as I shuffled to the bedroom. Once my head had hit the pillow I would like to say I fell asleep, but memories of the prior night tormented me to no end as I tossed and turned. Dawn had came after what felt like eons, giving up on the idea of sleep I resolved myself to ready myself for the day. Thoughts felt blurred and balance nonexistant as if I spent the night drinking, I thought it had to just be stress wearing me down, it made sense at the time. 

I swung my feet over the bedside and attempted to stand up, my legs buckled as soon as my body went upright and I fell down to the floor. Every muscle was exhausted, even moving a finger was almost too much to do in my current state. As I sat there on the floor there was a sensation on the back of my neck, it felt like breath, it was warm and made the spot which it blew on damp. Turning back and seeing nothing eased my mind at the time as I just blamed it on fever or the body acting strange with sleep deprivation, there was something much more pressing that I had to do after all. There was a resurgence of my energy if only by a hairs width after a few minutes which allowed me to move. With the little energy I now had I began making my way to the kitchen to steep some coffee to stave off this exhaustion, it was one step after the other with my full attention being on each step as to not stumble. My body was sluggish and I doubted in my current state that I could even make it to my work without collapsing, but sleep wasn't an option so loading my nervous system with enough caffeine to kill an elephant had to do. Entering the kitchen my body still felt exhausted, but it had seemed to ease somewhat after getting further from the bedroom. My hands shook as I grabbed a cup from the cabinet above the coffee maker, preparing coffee with enough ease I then moved to the dining table take a seat. The coffee slowly dripped into the cup, with it taking so long I thought it'd be best to begin cleaning myself up while it was being made. Standing up I exited the kitchen and  made my way to the bathroom to freshen up, I thought my coworker might just run away if I looked so disheveled. If a coworker came to me looking like a bat out of hell I'd probably get out of there as fast as possible as well. While inching towards the bathroom it felt like gravity became greater, and looking ahead towards my bedroom door created a sinking feeling in my soul. Luckily the bathroom wasn't past the bedroom, if it was I'm not sure what I would have done. 

Pressing the switch in the hall the light of the bathroom flickered on, the bulbs seemed to be on their last bit of life as they flickered erratically. When I entered the bathroom my eyes focused on the mirror as I stared at myself in disbelief, the hairs on my head were gray, creases lined my face to where one would think I aged 30 years. I brought my hand up and ran it down my face, it was rough, and the skin had lost its elasticity. Would my coworker even recognize me? I don't even look like the same person she had talked to last week. Worrying about these things now would be pointless however, maybe I could just cover myself up and say I have a cold. Even though I knew it was pointless to worry I couldn't help but wonder what was happening to me, it wasn't natural. No man should randomly grow old in the span of a day, but it was just another strange thing to add to the list of occurances. After some freshening up I grabbed clothes from the hamper, the feeling my bedroom gave off was just too daunting to come closer to now that I became aware of it. The rest of the time was spent drinking cup after cup of coffee, til heart palpitations kicked in as I waited til I could leave. I had grabbed my phone off the floor while waiting, the blood on it was crusted and there was a small dent on the corner, but luckily my throw didn't break it further,  I then went back to the kitchen to wait. Tapping my foot on the ground sitting at that dining room table while absorbed in my axiety was the only thing I could do. When time for work came I grabbed my coat, scarf, and toque from the coat hanger by the door, I'd look odd but at least they wouldn't see the change of my face. The coat was larger as if I had shrunk, it made me question whether I had the right one or not but after a few seconds I was sure it was mine. Getting to work went smoothly fortunately, I entered the building and saw a few puzzled looks, likely wondering why I was covered head to toe. My mind only had one thought, to find my coworker. I looked around at the front of the store but she wasn't there so I made my way to the back. Opening the door to the back, I saw her and my strange choice of clothing seemed to have grabbed her attention. She looked at me for a second and then asked me what I was doing. ""Why are you wearing that? It's the middle of July.""

""O-oh, I just have a bit of a cold, thought I could still work but now that I'm here I'm not too sure.""

""Hmm, well better tell the manager so you can go home already, you really aren't looking so great."" She was looking me up and down, my body was shaking from all the caffeine and I was breathing heavily, no wonder why she would say something like that. ""Oh yeah, b-but first, can I talk to you about Sophia?""

""Sophia?"" It didn't seem like she remembered, my heart was cracking solely by the tone of a reply, it was like she was talking about a stranger. After a pause she continued.

""The name sounds familiar..."" She held her head in her hand and her eyebrows furrowed. 

""It feels familiar but I'm drawing a blank, I'll contact you later if I remember."" I saw her face wince a bit, like something struck her. ""Oh man, give me a second, my heads throbbing, I'll contact you later.""

""Yeah yeah yeah, no problem, just text me when you're up for it."" She seemed puzzled for a second before responding. ""Why would I have your number, wait why did I think I had your number?"" The response gave me a glimpse of hope, maybe memories still resided in her subconcious even if she couldn't remember. Right now though, I doubted spilling everything would work so I just made up an excuse.

""Oh, well we've worked together for a while so it'd make sense, but no worry I'll just write it down for you."" I grabbed a random receipt from my coat pocket and grabbed a pen on the table, I quickly wrote it down then handed it to her. ""In any case, I'm gonna go back home and rest up, I hope your headache gets better.""

""I hope so too."" With that I left her, left the building, then drove back to my house. After entering my home I slammed the door and went back to the couch, even if they had some underlying memory their memories of her were removed, they really didn't know her, she really was gone. If I had more energy I would have gone into a fit of rage but I was just so exhausted, the effect of the caffeine was weakening and I just sat there in a semi-comatose state. At one point I could've sworn I saw worms exiting the walls like they had when I was a child but they vanished in the blink of an eye. While being in that state time passed quickly, it was a while before I was snapped out of it by a phone call. Reaching my hand into my pants pocket and looking at the screen I saw a number that was familiar, but without the name of the contact I couldn't recall who it was. I answered the phone and a delirious voice seeped out. ""What'd you do to me!"" The voice startled me and I regretted having the phone so close to my ear when answering. ""Right after you asked me that question that incessant headache started, I left early due to the headache and when I got home I began to remember. I remembered Sophia, and right when I recalled her is when these things started growing on my body, and I'm seeing strange things in my vision. What's happening? What did you do!""

""I didn't do anything! Something happened and I just wanted to see if someone remembered her.""

""Well great for you, now I'm in deep shit, I tried to call for 911 but the only number I'm able to call is yours for some damn reason. Just get over here, I don't want to be alone and I'm feeling cold..."" At the last part of the sentence her voice sounded hollow, lacking the emotions a human would carry, like she was losing herself, I was worried and knew I had to go. She gave me her address before hanging up, and after putting the coordinates in my phones GPS I dashed out of the house. It hadn't taken me long to get to her house by car, 8 minutes at most. When I arrived the door was slightly ajar and there were no lights visible from the outside. I crept closer to the house but felt an ominous aura eminating from it, but if she was in there and this was all my fault shouldn't I go in. With some new found resolve I headed towards the entrance, the door creaked as it opened slowly and there was a chill in the air coming from within the house. Moving through the doorway I found a light switch and attempted flicking it on but I had no luck, it was dead, so with my phone as my only light source I turned on the flashlight and continued through the house. There was a thin layer of ice lining the walls and also some white tendril like lines lining all sides of the rooms. The chill of the air got worse as I carried on and the crooked white lines seemed to have gotten more dense and become one in some parts. It was certainly creepy but there was some allure to it as well, I wanted to touch the walls but my gut begged me not to so I obliged. The lines took off to the right to a hallway and then a door, I followed them and entered a small room, what laid before me was a corpse. 

The corpse was blue, holes perforated it's body, and through the holes mushrooms had sprouted. Ice crystals had formed all around the skin, and the white lines poured out from below the body. In that moment I realized what the white lines were, they were mycelium for the mushrooms in the body. I stood there, bending over in an attempt to get a look at the face, but that too was full of holes, and large mushrooms protruded from where the mouth would have been. I stood there in disbelief and upon noticing the shirt she was wearing I knew who this was, my coworker who I had been talking to only moments before became this. I began to back away but the body began to twitch and convulse, it rose to it's feet like a puppet and I could see mycelium from the ceiling holding it up. It looked at me with that face full of holes, it's left arm raised and it made a motion beckoning me over. A gargled sound welled up within it. ""Hhhheellpp meeee."" Was she not dead yet? If she wasn't dead yet she would be soon and there was no way I would touch that. I began to step backwards, when the creature heard the cracking of ice my foot made when I moved it lunged. I saw mycelium peel off the wall as the body began to hurdle towards me, it's mouth full of mushrooms grew wide enough to where I could see the stalks. I turned around and began to bolt, energy swelling up within me in this do or die moment.

 The mycelium seemed to pulse along the walls, and the ice made it difficult to fully run, luckily it made what was chasing me slip as well. I continued to run, I swear I should've been out of the house by then but the end seemed no closer and my stamina was fading. The creatures stamina seemed unlimited as it never lost steam, my mind was going blank from exhaustion and my muscles began to ignore my pleas to move. It was at that moment I lost control over my body and that breath on my neck reappeared, my body began to gain speed but I wasn't the one moving. My body moved in strides but it was as if I was watching a movie, I saw it leap over objects, and when it found a window it jumped through covering my body in cuts. When it exited the house it hadn't stopped, it was like something was taking my body for a joyride. I didn't feel exhausted even with my body moving at break neck speeds, I looked around and saw so many strange creatures. Creatures that towered over the city patrolled around, and these multi colored scorpion like creatures moved out of drainage holes. I could see human like creatures staring me down, some with saliva dripping from their mouths, others with their arms and legs disproportional to their body. Some had no faces, others had eyes floating around their heads, it was like memories of my childhood all over again. I attempted to resist the movement of my body but it would not listen, I had no energy and it allowed whatever it was to gain full control. It eventually made its way to my house with me being its unwilling cargo. 

The worms that once flashed in my vision and left were now moving through the structure of the house constantly, shifting themselves through the ceiling and floor as well. When I entered my house I saw where it was taking me, back to my room, the source of a carnal fear that flooded my psyche. It was hopeless to resist as it dragged me there, it sat my body down on the desk in my room and that was that. I don't know how long I've been like this, it gave me back some ability to move my head and arms, but my legs are still planted in place, if I try and resist its desires it takes control once more. Things enter this room every now and then, but their strange appearences have become normal to me, they stare for a while before leaving, I don't what they are doing. It seems my need for food and water have dissipated, I don't know what my body has become now but I'm afraid to know so I keep my phone away so I can't see a reflection. After all this time I'm fairly certain that I'm a tool to spread their influence, sowing ideas of them into the minds of people. How many more people will they take away I wonder, it's not like they'll be missed, they'll be forgotten like everyone else, and anyone who does remember will simply be new prey. Well now that I've finished writing I can't say for sure what will happen next, if I'm lucky maybe I'll be finished off but who's to say. I guess I never got to figure out what happened with my wife, and I doubt I ever will, maybe she was luckily and truly dissapeared in an instant, or maybe she became a puppet by the creature that ate her. In any case I'm signing off, and if you ever see these creatures, these things that must have come from hell, I wish you luck.  ",1,1735980584.0,Secretill,0,1.0,False

1htaa71,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1htaa71/aio_by_feeling_hurt_my_fil_is_always_undermining/,AIO By feeling hurt my FIL is always undermining me ,"I (38f) have been with my fianc√© (36m) for almost 2 years, living together almost a year and a half. About 2.5 yrs ago, he found out he had a daughter thru CPS when the mother was arrested on drugs and daughter (about 1.5 at the time) was taken into custody. In a phone call, found out he probably had a daughter and if he wanted to get her which involved a lot of hoops. 

He got full custody of her, moms still on drugs in and out of jail, no help from her at all. I told him when we got together, my belief is kids come first and I will do my best to always do so. He works full-time and I was only part-time so I really spend more time with her. 
I have taken huge part in her care of her everyday for the past 18mo. She's not biologically my daughter but, she's absolutely my daughter and we're absolutely a family.

So we just moved out of state, renting a mother in law unit on SOs father's & stepmoms property. They're happy to have their granddaughter and that is fantastic. I 100% want her to have all the support in the world. She has addiction history on both sides of family, I'm sure her mom was using when pregnant, she was exposed to drugs and who knows what else before being taken by CPS, put with a foster family then given to a father she didn't know. It's a rough start and she deserves all the love, support and help she can get.

Anyways, since we've been here (2MO) I have been full time care provider. My fiance got a job immediately and just got her enrolled in preschool starting tomorrow so I've been Stay at Home Mom. Anytime when we visit and I am parenting her, her grandpa says ""oh no that's ok."" Like saying no treats before dinner and he sayy ""no that's ok"" and give her a cookie and juice then she won't eat dinner. If I try to remind her not to run inside (brick mantle, glass coffee table, etc) or it's not nice to interrupt people when they talk, we gotta wait our turn.. 

ALWAYS, he says ""oh that's ok"" and encourages her to continue what I was trying to correct. I feel his actions are literally saying ""we don't have to listen to her"" when I am literally the one who spends the most time with her and I'm only looking out for her health, safety and manners. And it's easier to gently correct her when she starts getting wound up, than to deal with it when it's imploded to a full on toddler temper tantrum.

I don't know if his interference is to ""save me"" from having to parent or to ""save her"" from following rules or if I'm ""not her real mom"" but it hurts and moreso it's harming our family. In the 2 months we've been here, her listening and manners have plummeted.  Tantrums have sky rocketed. 

Tonight he took her off my lap and out of my arms when I was telling her she could dance to the people playing music but they were invited to play and it's not nice to tell them to stop. (They had a couple over to play guitar and sing, an annual thing they do. She then kept yelling telling them to stop mid song and telling them to be quiet so everyone could watch her dance.) Then he told her she could play his friends guitar. The guy clearly didn't look comfortable with it and held it out for her to touch and she started twisting the tabs so he quickly pulled it back and had to return his guitar. And then the couple are looking at us like we let her run wild. 

 I was already frustrated about this behavior and to take her out of my arms just felt next level. I felt upset so I waited a few minutes then excused myself and retired early, left her there with her dad. 

Half hour later, they come through the door, Dad telling her to get in time out and her stomping, yelling ""I DON'T WANT TO!"" So basically, without little reminders and corrections, her behavior got so bad they couldn't pretend it was cute anymore so we had a screaming tantrum and had to put her to bed early. 

I've tried to lightweight bring it up a few times and while his wife seems to totally get it, he's just brushed it away.

I want to sit down with them and discuss my concerns about the example it's setting and discord it's sewing but I first wanted to ask..

Am I wrong for thinking that I have a duty to parent her, to try to keep her from getting hurt or sick, to teach her how to express herself and to use manners?

Nescafe had 35 pack per bag which was nicer on the wallet for us. Thanks in advance! üôè",3,1735979959.0,askSingapore,6,1.0,False

In my journey to try speciality coffees from different roasters, one which I saw being frequently mentioned was SavorWorks. I ordered 2 of their signature coffees, Fruit Bomb and Phenom.

I really had high hopes for this coffee due to all the big words mentioned on the packaging and how some members of this channel absolutely swear by it. Oh my ! what a dissapointment !

1. **Fruits Bomb** \- Supposed to be a fruity, medium light roast. What I actually got was an extremely generic mix with no highlighting characteristics. The beans seems more tending towards medium-dark roast than a medium-light (which might explain why such fruity characters are nonexistent). Moreover, beans are unevenly roasted. Notes I can gather - Chocolate, woody, slight generic acidity. At this price point, I will rather order BT Attikan / Silver Oak Cafe blends if I want such a generic coffee.
2. **Phenom** \- Again same story, but a bit better. Supposed to be a medium roast with fruity notes. What I actually got was a generic coffee with a occasional suggestion of fruity flavours. Beans seems to be roasted better (but still uneven), maintaining its medium roast profile. Notes I can gather - Slight plum acidity, woody, chocolaty, ripe fruits. Again, at this specialty coffee price point, I am expecting something much better.

For the benefit of doubt, I dialed-down my water temperature, grinded both finer and coarser, and changed brewing methods (Aeropress/V60/Moka Pot). Nope, nothing improved it.

Has anyone faced the same (quality degradation) recently which might explain how I got a bad batch ? Or is it just how it is supposed to be (which will be really dissapointing honestly).",5,1735979878.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the breathtaking country of Georgia this December, and our experience has been nothing short of *wildly beautiful*! From the landscapes to the people to the food ‚Äì everything about this country left us awestruck. We couldn‚Äôt help but fall in love with it. üíï

**A Special Shoutout to GTG and Rezo!** üöó  
Our journey started with a car rental through GTG, and honestly, it set the tone for our adventure. I booked a car a month before arriving, and from the moment I did, Rezo from GTG reached out on WhatsApp, staying in touch throughout and answering any questions we had. When we landed, a GTG representative was waiting at the airport with our name ‚Äì talk about stellar service! After a quick inspection, we were handed the keys to an upgraded, nearly brand-new Mazda CX5 parked just steps away from the airport exit. The process was seamless and professional.

However, our adventure wasn‚Äôt without its hiccups. On our first day, after a long drive through snowy terrains from Kutaisi to Mestia, our car slid and unfortunately hit another vehicle. Cue Rezo and his team coming to the rescue like absolute heroes. From coordinating with the other party, helping us navigate legal protocols, and liaising with locals (who were incredibly kind and helpful) to managing insurance and ensuring we were taken care of ‚Äì they did it all.

Rezo himself drove SIX HOURS into the mountains to personally deliver a replacement vehicle the next morning! His level of care and commitment was nothing short of humbling. A huge thank you to Rezo and Eelie for turning what could‚Äôve been a stressful experience into one filled with gratitude. üôè

**A Journey Through Snow and Determination: Our 20-Hour Drive to Mestia** ‚ùÑÔ∏èüèîÔ∏è  
Day one of our trip was nothing short of an odyssey. After landing in Kutaisi, we picked up our car and set off straight for Mestia‚Äîa drive that was supposed to take 6 hours but ended up being a *20-hour ordeal*.

The drive started off smoothly, but about 90 km from Mestia, it began snowing‚Äîlightly at first, then heavily. The uphill roads became blanketed with snow, and we inched forward slowly, following any tracks we could find. The tunnels on the way (I counted 10 in total!) became much-needed refuges amidst the snowy stretches. But at the 7th tunnel, around 8 AM, we found no more tracks to follow. Exhausted from the journey, we decided to nap inside the car at the tunnel‚Äôs exit.

The scene was surreal: the tunnel‚Äôs arch framing the snowy landscape, with snow-covered pine trees creating a picture-perfect fairytale moment. After an hour of rest, we woke to find fresh tracks‚Äîsomeone had braved the snow ahead of us. We resumed the journey, hopeful once again.

However, about 40 km from Mestia, we hit another roadblock. A few cars were stranded, and the tracks stopped. With no other choice, we decided to turn back 50 km to the nearest snow-free town. It was disheartening, but safety came first. By now, it was 1 PM.

Throughout this ordeal, we were in touch with our hostess, Ksenia, who had rented us a villa in Mestia. Despite our challenges, she strongly encouraged us to try again, insisting the destination was worth it. At the nearest town, we grabbed some local hot bread, parked near an old Soviet dam, and rested. A local baker also urged us to continue our journey, convincing us to give it one more shot.

At 2 PM, we restarted the drive. This time, the path was promising‚Äîsnowplows had cleared some tracks, and we followed larger vehicles up the mountain. By 5 PM, we were just 20 km from Mestia when disaster struck‚Äîour car slid and hit an oncoming vehicle. The car was rendered immobile, and we had to call the police and GTG for assistance.

Despite the chaos, the kindness we encountered was incredible. The police not only helped us with the paperwork but also gave us snacks and Fanta before dropping us off at our villa. We finally reached around 11 PM, exhausted but relieved.

**A Birthday to Remember üéÇ**  
Amidst this whirlwind day, one detail made it extra special‚Äîit was my wife‚Äôs birthday! I had asked Ksenia to arrange a custom cake made by *Kate‚Äôs Cakes in Mestia*: a three-tiered masterpiece with alternating chocolate and vanilla sponge layers, filled with caramel and chocolate ganache. It was perfect.

The following day, I visited Kate‚Äôs Cakes to thank them for their incredible creation. That night, after everything we had been through, my wife and I cut the cake in our cozy villa, overlooking the snow-covered mountains. It was a moment of joy and gratitude, capping off an unforgettable day.

**The Rest of the Adventure**  
The remaining days in Georgia were filled with magic: walking on snow-covered roads, driving through stunning areas around Mestia, dining by fireplaces, relaxing at cozy cafes, and simply soaking in the charm of this winter wonderland. Snow was everywhere, the people were warm and welcoming, and the coffee was delicious.

Georgia has left me head over heels in love with her. ‚ù§Ô∏è

We eventually drove back to Kutaisi, this time completing the journey in the standard 6 hours. After returning the car to GTG, we flew back to our home in Abu Dhabi, our hearts full of memories and gratitude.",10,1735979477.0,Sakartvelo,0,0.92,False

I let out a satisfied huff as I took a second to catch my breath after concluding my morning 5 mile treadmill run. It was nice getting back to my usual morning exercise schedule now that I had taken time to set up all the various gym equipment that grampy had sent me.

It really helped clear my head after the past few days events. I had managed to play the cool-cucumber until Tolva, Helin, and Danly left yesterday morning but I spent half the remainder of the day just laying on my back staring up at the ceiling.

It helped that Grampy had taken the news of what had happened so well, I was more than half expecting him to put a warship in orbit and land troops on the ground. Instead he remained calm and told me that he was proud of how I had handled it and that he would get me anything I needed, anything at all.

*Grampy is the best*

***Grampy acted suspicious.***

*What?*

***He took it waaay too well and you know it.***

*Ugh.*

I shook my head to try and dislodge the unease that was twisting up in my stomach and headed for the shower.

\------

**Advance time 20 minutes**

\------

After getting dressed for the day in a t-shirt and sweatpants I quickly made myself a disgusting breakfast smoothie and chugged it down as quickly as I could before washing it down with a glass of ice water. I shuddered as I waited a few seconds for the awful taste and abominable texture to fully leave my mouth and throat before sitting down on the couch and pulling out my pad.

I navigated through my contacts and was about to call Vosk when I heard the now familiar \*Bing-Bong!\* of the front door chime.

I frowned, I wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone as Tolva had promised to spend the first half of the day with his sister.

*Who could that be?*

I took a deep breath and let it out slowly as I worked up the energy to answer the door and indulge in a little unplanned socialization. After a moment or two I called out that I was coming and got up.

I crossed the main room of the hab and stepped down into the little tiled area in front of the door where I put on the silvery mask that was hanging next to the door and then pressed the button to activate the display for the door camera which revealed... no one?

There wasn‚Äôt anyone or anything there.

*A ding-dong-ditch? That‚Äôs... kinda adorable actually.*

I started to reach for the handle when I stopped myself.

*No... it... no, that‚Äôs not... nah... but...*

I opened the closet and took my belt off of the shelf on top. I put it on real quick and checked my revolver before taking a deep breath and opening the door.

Rather than an invisible monster ready to pounce on me and take revenge for its fallen kin, I found myself looking down at a small and familiar Venpup.

‚ÄúDanly?‚Äù I asked with confusion

The little pup nodded, his tail wagging happily behind him

I opened and closed my mouth a few times ‚ÄúDo you... need something? Is everything ok?‚Äù

He nodded and I noticed then that the pup was holding a little pad, I assume one made for children given the brightly colored and robustly built body of it. He typed something out and held it up for me to see, <Can I have an ice treat?>

I blinked a few times before giggling, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, have you had your breakfast yet?‚Äù

He fidgeted his little toes a bit as he looked down for a moment before shaking his head.

I laughed, ‚ÄúWell you can‚Äôt have the treat before the meal,‚Äù I said before stepping aside, ‚Äúwell come on, I‚Äôll fix you up something,‚Äù

He looked surprised to hear this and his tail wagged excitedly as he hurried past me and stood next to one of the tall chairs with an expectant look.

I chuckled again as I closed the door and gave him a hand up into the chair before stepping up into the kitchen and quickly pulling out everything I needed. Almond milk, apple cider vinegar, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, *real* maple syrup (none of that fake stuff), margarine, and vanilla extract.

After about six minutes of measuring and mixing I poured the mixture into the double waffle maker that had arrived alongside all the treats and snacks I had ordered. I waited for the steam to stop rising out of the maker and then opened up to retrieve the pair of fluffy waffles which I put on a plate before spreading a little more margarine on top and adding a bit of maple syrup.

‚ÄúHere ya go,‚Äù I said as I set the plate down in front of him alongside a fork.

It was only after I did this that I remembered that Venlil didn‚Äôt use any kind of ‚Äòpointy‚Äô silverware and for a second I felt a small hint of panic as I recalled behind warned that it might be viewed as a weapon.

However, to my surprise and relief, Danly picked up the fork without hesitation and quickly demonstrated that he was familiar with the utensil: using the side of it to cut off a little piece of fluffy waffle before spearing it and bringing it to his mouth.

As soon as it touched his tongue his eyes went wide and ears did an excited little flapping motion.

I giggled as he quickly took another bite, ‚ÄúI take it that you‚Äôre a fan of waffles?‚Äù

The little pup nodded eagerly and after a few minutes the waffles were both gone in their entirety.

*Well, I‚Äôm glad I made two.*

I chuckled as I took the plate and set it in the sink before wetting a washcloth and wiping his face and paws of any lingering stickiness.

‚ÄúThere we go, all cleaned up. Do you still have room for a freezie?‚Äù

Danly nodded eagerly and I smiled as I fetched one from the freezer and snipped the top off before handing it to him, ‚Äúthere you go,‚Äù

His tail wagged happily and I‚Äôm pretty sure I caught a >thank you< in the variously swivels and swishes of his ears.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very welcome,‚Äù I said in response just before a beeping from my pad pulled my attention away.

I pulled it out of my pocket and smiled as I saw that it was Vosk calling. I gave another glance towards Danly to make sure he seemed content where he was before pressing the talk button, ‚ÄúHello, Vosk,‚Äù I said with a smile as his fierce yet beautiful visage appeared on the screen

‚ÄúThis one greets you!‚Äù Vosk replied eagerly before snapping his jaws loudly

‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs excited,‚Äù I remarked with a laugh, ‚Äúsomething good happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù He affirmed with a nod, ‚ÄúThis one has been given an opportunity, an opportunity to Visit you,‚Äù

I blinked a few times, ‚Äúuh, come again?‚Äù

Vosk made a low, hissing exhale to calm himself before explaining, ‚ÄúThis one, like all the Arxur raised by humans on earth, has a mentor - another Arxur who this one is to learn from where the human‚Äôs lessons fall short,‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúShe is strange and wise, and this one believes that she sees, hears, and understands things that she should not,‚Äù He hissed again and shook his head, ‚ÄúBut, that is not important. What is important is that she is serving with the sapient coalition, she travels aboard one of their ships and offers guidance to the hunters of the management office. Grandfather has informed this one that the ship she serves on shall be coming to the colony which you are visiting and has told this one that this one may accompany her.‚Äù

I opened and closed my mouth a few times, there was no way that an Arxur coming here could ever be anything but a terrible idea. But... hmm, no even if he cannot come to the colony I could visit him onboard the ship and maybe we could do something in the wilderness away from the colony where he won‚Äôt scare anyone, ‚ÄúI would love that, I-‚Äù

I stopped as I felt something prick the back of my leg and I looked down to see Danly trying to climb up me. I laughed and shook my head, ‚ÄúDanly, I‚Äôm in a call,‚Äù

He looked up at me and raised his little paws above his head, opening and closing them a few times rapidly. It would seem that the request for ‚Äòuppies‚Äô was universal between Venlil and humans, ‚ÄúDanly, I‚Äôm talking to an Arxur and-‚Äù

The pup nodded eagerly, his tail swaying as he hopped up and down twice to emphasise his desire to be picked up. I hesitated. ‚ÄúYou do know what an Arxur is, right Danly?‚Äù

The pup nodded again as he rose up to his tip toes.

‚ÄúWho are you speaking to?‚Äù Vosk asked curiously

‚ÄúI- Well, my neighbor‚Äôs pup. I think he wants to see you,‚Äù I replied with a sigh

Vosk snapped his jaws, ‚ÄúAh, it wishes to gaze upon the monster, yes? Very well,‚Äù

‚ÄúVosk, don‚Äôt you go *trying* to scare him, understand?‚Äù

The pearlescent Arxur nodded and I let out a heavy sigh before kneeling down and scooping up Danly with one arm.¬†

*Oh my god he is soft.*

He was softer even than Tolva and I found that his apparent size was at least 1/3rd floof. I couldn‚Äôt suppress the small \*squee\* of delight as the little pup hugged around my neck and nuzzled in under my chin with his head turned so that one of his boxy pupils could focus on the screen of my pad.

Vosk tilted his head slightly, apparently intrigued by the tiny Venlil now on the screen, ‚ÄúWhat is it‚Äôs name?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis name is Danly. He‚Äôs mute, uh, meaning he can‚Äôt speak,‚Äù I informed Vosk, ‚ÄúDanly this is Vosk, he‚Äôs my little brother,‚Äù

Vosk snapped his jaws when I called him my little brother, but he at least made sure to look away from the screen when he did so. Danly giggled in apparent delight and waved his little paw at the screen, puzzling Vosk further.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very handsome, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù I cooed to Danly with a smile

Danly nodded in agreement, making Vosk go wide eyed before going rather red as he looked away and snapped his jaws again, ‚ÄúYou tease this one too much,‚Äù he complained in a quiet, low voice

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a big sister‚Äôs job,‚Äù I informed him with a laugh, ‚ÄúBesides, it‚Äôs hardly teasing to simply state the truth.‚Äù

Vosk went more red as Danly giggled, ‚ÄúThis one-. This one will call you later, when plans are made,‚Äù he said before abruptly ending the call. I might have worried I had pushed a little too much if not for the slight wagging of his thick and sturdy tail I could just barely see before he hung up.

‚ÄúThere, are you happy you got to see my little brother?‚Äù I asked with a chuckle as I looked down at the pup.

He giggled some more and nodded before reaching up and touching my mask. He then made a motion like he was taking off a mask of his own and I smiled with my brows raised.

‚ÄúYou wanna see my face too?‚Äù

He nodded eagerly and I chuckled before slowly taking it off, keeping an eye on his face for any sign of distress.

Rather than distress, he seemed delighted and wagged his tail and his ears this way and that before reaching up and pressing on my nose with the palm-pad of his soft little paw.

I laughed and gently booped him on the end of his snout in return, getting a giggle from the energetic little bundle of wool. I smiled and tickled his fluffy tummy a bit, getting more lovely whistling giggles as he pushed my hand away as he used the fluffy tuft at the end of his tail to tickle at my neck. I laughed and flinched away a little, smiling in delight.

Just then our playing was interrupted by a frantic \*bing-bo-Bing-b-Bing-bong!\* from the door as the ringer was pressed multiple times in quick succession. I frowned and stepped over to the door, pressing the display button which revealed a practically panicked looking Berra standing there ringing her tail and looking about frantically.

I furrowed my brow and frowned down at the pup in my arms who was suddenly trying to look everywhere except the screen or my face, ‚ÄúYou little stinker, did you sneak over when mom wasn‚Äôt looking?‚Äù

I gave a \*tsk, tsk\* before opening the door.

‚ÄúMs. Elanor have you seen-‚Äù The sandy-blonde Venlil stopped mid-burst of words as she saw what, or rather who, I was holding. She let go of her tail and her knees trembled a little and she looked like she was about to break down in tears of relief as her ears swished this way and that, ‚ÄúI-I was so scared, I- I- he was just gone and- and- and-‚Äù

The happy playfulness I was feeling was instantly drowned in a wave of guilt and shame, ‚Äúoh my god, I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I said as I knelt down and Handed over Danly who she hugged tightly, ‚ÄúHe came over and asked for a freezie, it didn‚Äôt even occur to me to make sure he had permission, I‚Äôm so, so, sorry,‚Äù

She wiped her eyes and shook her head, ‚ÄúN-no, thank you. Thank you for looking after him. I-I spent all night at the clinic with Camli and I-I must have nodded off while I was making breakfast for us,‚Äù

I hesitated, not knowing at all what to do or say but feeling a huge lump of guilt still lodged firmly in my throat, ‚Äúuh. D-did you eat?‚Äù I asked after a moment

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù

‚ÄúI made waffles for Danly and there‚Äôs still a fair bit of batter left over,‚Äù

Her tail swished slowly, her ears and head cocking to the right, ‚ÄúUou.. Made him... waffles?‚Äù

I felt a whole new wave of panic inside as I realized that I definitely should have cleared any food I gave him with his mother. I swallowed dryly and nodded slowly, ‚Äúuh, y-yeah. I-I found a recipe online and practiced it a bunch before coming here so I -uh- so I could make them for Tolva,‚Äù

Berra hung her head and for a second I panicked as I thought she started to cry, but she threw her head back and let out a hearty belly laugh, ‚Äúoh my stars, you little trouble maker,‚Äù she chuckled after a moment, looking down at Danly in her arms, ‚Äúyou had your mommy Berra all worried about you and here you were having delicious human treats,‚Äù

She laughed for a few more seconds before letting out a sigh and wiping a tear from her eye as she regain her composure, ‚Äúyes,‚Äù she said, looking up at me, ‚ÄúI- I would *love* waffles,‚Äù

\------

**Advance time 15 minutes**

\------

Berra let out a content sigh as she set the fork down on the plate and her ears fluttered a bit as she leaned back in her chair with a somewhat dreamy expression, ‚ÄúOh my stars, I haven‚Äôt had human cooking since the exchange program\~‚Äù she said with a musical trilling undertone to her voice, ‚ÄúI almost forgot how *good* you guys are at making delicious food,‚Äù

I blushed and did my best to not let my small smile show as I took the empty plate to the sink, ‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs *that* good, but thank you,‚Äù

She laughed, ‚Äúoh it most certainly *is* that good, Ms.Florence,‚Äù

‚ÄúY-you can just call me Elanor,‚Äù I said shyly with my back turned as I put some cling wrap over the rest of the batter before placing it in the fridge.

Berra chuckled warmly, ‚ÄúVery well, Elanor. Say, would you mind explaining just what Danly means by a ‚Äòpretty Arxur‚Äô?‚Äù

I froze a second before I felt my face go warm before closing the fridge and turning to offer my explanation, ‚Äúuh, I- uh... well it‚Äôs a bit of a story but an Arxur named Vosk has been adopted into my family and he called me while Danly was eating his freezie and the little guy *insisted* I pick him up so he could see,‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything for a few seconds, just blinking slowly as she processed that, ‚ÄúI... see,‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, y-yeah. It‚Äôs uh... well, umm,‚Äù I fidgeted a little as I tried to work out what I was supposed to say next, ‚Äúuh, Danly seems rather, uh... bold?‚Äù

That made Berra chuckle again, ‚Äúthat he is. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Me or Camli he gets it from, but he‚Äôs certainly that,‚Äù her smile slowly transitioned into a frown as she eyed my mid section

I looked down and realized that I was still wearing my gun belt, ‚Äúoh uh, I completely forgot about that,‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there... a reason you have it on in the first place?‚Äù She asked hesitantly, ‚ÄúI understand that some places on earth are rather... lax in their views on weapons and I‚Äôve heard that in some places people commonly walk around with weapons openly on their person, but...‚Äù

‚ÄúOh uh,‚Äù I blushed, ‚Äúwell uh... Danly is... well, he‚Äôs too short to be seen by the door camera, at least when he stands close to the door and I... gosh,‚Äù I fumbled a bit as I tried to unfasten the belt, my embarrassment and self consciousness making my hands shake a bit, ‚ÄúI-uh... w-well when he rang the bell and I didn‚Äôt see anyone there I\~ ugh, god it‚Äôs silly to say out loud, but I thought maybe it might be one of the phantoms back for revenge,‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you really think that‚Äôs something they‚Äôd be capable of?‚Äù

My face felt like it was on fire and I‚Äôm sure I had to be cherry red as I looked down at my feet, ‚Äúuh... I- I dunno?‚Äù

I risked a glance up and rather than incredulously, Berra looked thoughtful, ‚Äúare there creatures on earth that could do that?‚Äù

I blinked a few times, surprised by how seriously she seemed to be considering it, ‚Äúuh, w-well yeah. Uh, Crows come to mind, I guess. I accidentally frightened one out of a tree with a wayward arrow once and uh, they launched a summer long harassment campaign against me. I know elephants too are supposed to be really smart and capable of some surprisingly elaborate and long-reaching revenge plans. Like smashing up the funerals of poachers,‚Äù I offered as I put the belt back on the top shelf in the closet by the front door.

‚ÄúInteresting... what made you think that they might be that smart?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell... uh, crows, uh... well when a crow dies, the rest of the murder -that‚Äôs what a flock of them is called- gather around the body to try to figure out what happened, to learn if there‚Äôs some new danger or something I guess. And uh, well the way that those things came back to your house made me think that maybe they were looking for their missing pack mate,‚Äù I explained

Berra nodded, ‚ÄúYou had mentioned that you‚Äôre pretty sure one got away after they attacked that second time, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù

‚ÄúSo maybe... maybe they could have identified *you* as the threat,‚Äù Berra offered before scowling slightly and giving an annoyed looking flick of her tail, ‚Äústars, I wish I had my pad to note this all down,‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, erm, I mean it‚Äôs just a silly thought I had so-‚Äù

Berra cut me off with a wave of her paw, ‚Äúno, no, it's a very valid thought and I wonder if there isn‚Äôt something to the idea. I remember from the zoology class I took during the exchange that corvids were known to actually *teach* each other, so if you anger or befriend one they will tell others about it,‚Äù

Ah, she was part of an exchange? That kind of makes sense why she‚Äôs so comfortable around me, ‚ÄúOh, you did an exchange?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, I volunteered right away,‚Äù She confirmed with a nod and somewhat embarrassed expression, ‚ÄúActually... to be honest, I was considered a bit of a crackpot in the scientific community that,‚Äù

I opened my mouth to ask more but before I could I noticed Danly was very preoccupied trying to figure out how to open a box he had found under the coffee table, ‚Äúoh, here,‚Äù I crossed the room and knelt down, flipping the latches and opening it up reveal an Artist‚Äôs pad.

I pulled the device out and booted it up, navigating to the simpler of the four art applications on it before pulling the stylus out of the slot on the side and handing the pad to Danly, ‚Äúhere, it‚Äôs for drawing,‚Äù I explained as I demonstrated the stylus, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs where you can change the color, and right here you can change what kind of brush it will use,‚Äù

Danly was looking at the pad with eyes like I had just revealed the holy grail to him and took the stylus in his paw with reverence before excitedly experimenting with it.

I giggled at his astonishment and gave him a gentle pat between the ears before standing and turning back to Berra, ‚Äúsorry, uh, where was I? Oh! What you said, are you a scientist?‚Äù

Berra‚Äôs attention seemed focused on Danly for a few moments before it shifted upwards to me, ‚Äúuh, s-sorry, what was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you a scientist, then?‚Äù I repeated

The distracted venlil nodded, ‚Äúuh, y-yes, that‚Äôs right. Uh... a-are you sure that you‚Äôre ok with him playing with that?‚Äù

I looked back and smiled as I watched Danly drawing what looked like some kind of tree, ‚Äúyeah, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúO-Ok, it‚Äôs just... isn‚Äôt it... expensive?‚Äù

I shook my head, ‚Äúnah, it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù

She hesitated before shaking her head and chuckling, ‚ÄúI guess I forgot just how *cheap* art supplies are for you humans,‚Äù

I frowned a little, ‚Äúoh...‚Äù

*I had forgotten about that. Does that mean that... does poor Danly not have anything to draw with? What about Phyli? That‚Äôs simply unacceptable!*

Berra looked a little confused, ‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo are art supplies still rare to come by here?‚Äù¬†

She nodded, ‚Äúyes, this colony is quite far out of the way and I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve gotten cheaper elsewhere, but every site I can find still has them listed as expensive as ever,‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs-‚Äù I paused and frowned, ‚ÄúActually... you might want to talk to Dema about that,‚Äù

She cocked her head, ‚ÄúDema? Wh- well, actually I guess that if he can get pads and terminals delivered then he must have some kind of contact for shipping. That‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean\~‚Äù I trailed off as It occurred to me that maybe this isn‚Äôt something Rahlo would want me to share... ah, screw it, ‚ÄúRahlo says that the Predator Watch has been forcing Dema to maintain some kind of super-censorship thing to block out and replace a bunch of stuff on the fly. Anything to do with trading with humans was probably doctored to look more expensive and less beneficial I bet.‚Äù

Berra looked utterly shocked, her eyes going wide before her expression slowly slipped into thoughtfulness and then anger, ‚ÄúWhy that- that makes sense! Ugh!‚Äù She balled up her little paw into a fist and thumped it on the table, surprising me and Danly both, ‚ÄúI- I... this whole time I thought that he\~ ugh. BRAHKING DAMN IT!‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy exchange partner Hughie, we promised to keep in touch after the program ended but he never once responded to anything I sent him so I gave up! I bet he never even got it! That-that-that those BASTARDS!‚Äù Her tail flicked angrily and her ears drew back, ‚Äúand all my papers too! I thought that there was just no interest but- STARS DAMN IT!‚Äù

‚ÄúPapers?‚Äù

Berra looked like she was about to launch into a tirade of some sort, but stopped herself as her gaze shifted to Danly who was now looking at her with surprise and concern.

‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù She let out a heavy sigh and shook her head, her ears and tail signaling something to Danly that seemed to reassure him as he went back to drawing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an ecologist by occupation and education. I run the ecology center here, you see.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù I perked up a little, ‚ÄúTolva wanted to take me there,‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle at the memory, ‚ÄúHe said that he was always too scared to go in the predator exhibit himself,‚Äù

That seemed to release the last tatters of the Venlil‚Äôs anger and she laughed quite heartily, ‚Äúah yes, I remember seeing him turn back at the second set of doors a few times. Of course,‚Äù her ear indicated towards Danly, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt help that *someone* like to play hide and seek in there and make noises to scare people,‚Äù

I snickered as Danly giggled and wagged his tail, clearly oh so *very* remorseful at the memory.

A thought occurred to me then, ‚Äúare you the one who will be conducting the autopsy on the Phantoms I killed?‚Äù

Berra nodded, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs right. I‚Äôve done some cursory observations and Rahlo carried out a... less scientific experiment with one of the cadavers - testing their resilience to ballistic weaponry - but Nothing in-depth has been done yet. Maybe... Maybe tomorrow? I suppose I should do it *before* they send Camli home so that I can focus entirely on helping her around the house,‚Äù

‚ÄúCan... can I ask you a few things about them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe phantoms? Sure,‚Äù

‚ÄúHave they always been a problem?‚Äù

Berra shook her head and sighed, ‚Äúno... actually, they didn‚Äôt really start being an issue until just about three years ago. They were nothing more than baseless rumors from jumpy exterminators before that. Something to note is that that‚Äôs two years after Pahlo took over as the head of the guild here. He was much more... uh, zealous and... proactive than his brother was... Truthfully I strongly suspect that one or a combination of three things happened: They directly or indirectly harmed the numbers of whatever phantoms were eating before - thus pushing them to start attacking the colony; They wiped out something that preyed on the phantoms - allowing their numbers to boom; or they did something that angered them.‚Äù

The last one surprised me to hear, ‚ÄúAngered them?‚Äù

Berra took a deep breath and fidgeted uncomfortably, ‚ÄúI... I looked at some of the reports of the attack, and reviewed some footage... It... I can‚Äôt deny what I saw and it makes me deeply uncomfortable,‚Äù

That got my attention.

‚ÄúThe phantoms first attacked via the shuttle port, they tried to get into the terminal but upon failing that they *dispersed*,‚Äù she shifted a little, her tail twitching a bit as she continued, ‚Äúthey spread out alone in different directions -*alone*\-, and when Predator Watch showed up they\~‚Äù

She swallowed and took a deep breath before sighing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve looked over the footage again and again, but I can‚Äôt find any other explanation. They each stood still long enough when confronted to *let* themselves get hosed down by the flamethrowers before bounding off. Not only that, they seemed to deliberately scrape up against buildings and trees as they ran, rubbing off the flamethrower fuel that was coating them and spreading smaller fires for several minutes before they each headed to whatever the nearest park was and rolled around in the dirt to get the rest off,‚Äù

I felt my face go pale, ‚ÄúWait... you mean... are you implying that they... used the fire to deliberately create a distraction for the other two?‚Äù

Berra nodded, ‚ÄúWe were at the park when the siren sounded and we ran home as fast as we could. If... If Camli hadn‚Äôt hadn't grabbed hold of one of their legs as it tried to run past her, it would have gotten to me and Danly too. I suspect that they were on the hunt for something that was near enough the place they snuck in that they could grab it and get out before the Predator Watch could respond,‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they ambushed you? I...‚Äù I frowned as I thought about it, ‚ÄúIf. *IF* they are that smart. Then if you go to that park frequently, they could have watched you from the other side of the fence, learned your route and schedule... That itself wouldn‚Äôt be strange actually. Many predators are capable of learning when and where their prey is vulnerable if they have some kind of set paths or routes,‚Äù

She nodded again and shivered, hugging herself slightly as her tail curled around a leg of the chair, ‚Äúit‚Äôs... It‚Äôs one thing to study predators with a drone on the other side of a monitor, or to perform autopsies on the bodies... but the thought that there might have been some watching me. Watching *Danly*. It... I... It makes me feel sick,‚Äù

I nodded sympathetically, ‚ÄúI... I wish I knew what to say. I... I- ugh, I‚Äôm terrible with words sometimes. Sorry. But, I agreed to help Rahlo with figuring out what to do about the colony‚Äôs predator problem so-... So I hope that I can help make you feel a little safer,‚Äù

Berra gave me a small smile and genuinely seemed a little relieved to hear that, ‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm glad. I hope that I can learn something about them by dissecting them. And of course, any ideas that you have I‚Äôd love to hear them,‚Äù

I nodded thoughtfully, ‚Äúuh... well hmm... I-I guess it‚Äôs probably pretty obvious, but I‚Äôd like to see what their scales look like under a few different wavelengths of light. From what I saw, it looked like their invisibility works by arranging their scales in such a way that light hits them on one side and is redirected through their scales and out the other side. I was thinking that maybe-‚Äù

She perked up and finished my thought for me, ‚ÄúMaybe not every wavelength can pass through neatly?‚Äù

I nodded, ‚Äúyeah, maybe... I don‚Äôt know, maybe if we‚Äôre lucky something as simple as an IR illuminator will make them sparkle in night vision,‚Äù

‚ÄúThat- Damn, I wish I had my pad. That just might work, after all if thermal energy was transferred through their scales like light was then rather than being heat resistant, their scales would heat up quickly and they would probably be *weak* to heat.‚Äù She fidgeted a moment, murmuring something under her breath and nodding a few times before she smiled brightly up at me, ‚Äúthat... I actually feel a little more confident already,‚Äù

I smiled back, feeling relieved I was able to help a little.

A little tug on the back of my pant leg drew my attention and I saw Danly holding the pad so that it was facing me. I squatted down and took the pad in one hand as I rested the other atop his head and gently scritched him between the ears, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see here... those look like Folly Fruit, so is this a Folly Fruit Tree?‚Äù I asked

He practically bounced with excited joy at my apparently correct deduction.

Berra came up from behind and I held up the pad for her to see, ‚Äúoh my!‚Äù she said with¬† surprise, ‚Äúthis is excellent! The leaves have just the right number of veins and points, and those marks on the trunk, are they bore holes from a blue bomber? This is wonderful Danly!‚Äù

‚ÄúBlue bomber?‚Äù I asked curiously

‚ÄúAh yes, they are a four winged avian who almost exclusively eat Folly Fruit. They peck holes into the trees to pluck out parasitic worms and beetles that might harm the three‚Äôs well being,‚Äù Berra explained, ‚ÄúAnd they get their name because... well, their plumage is a brilliant sapphire and they pick up fallen Folly Fruits off the ground and fly them to clearings where they can drop them on the ground from great height to try and crack them open to get at the fruit inside. They are especially fond of dropping them on rocks... or an unfortunate passerby if they decide that they look like a rock from above,‚Äù

I winced as I remembered the heft of the one I had sampled, ‚ÄúThat sounds painful,‚Äù

She chuckled as I gave the pad back to Danly who quickly went back to drawing something new, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre lucky it‚Äôs painful. Otherwise\~ well, I‚Äôm sure you can imagine.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, if the phantoms are a more recent danger, what was the fence initially constructed to keep out?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell the two main threats were brush reapers, and night haunts, but they‚Äôve been all-but ‚Äòexterminated‚Äô in the area surrounding the colony for almost a decade now,‚Äù Berra explained, ‚ÄúIf I had my pad I‚Äôd show you pictures, but the brush reapers are... hrmm... I think... I think the best way I can describe it would be a small, scaly panther with a sword for a tail and night haunts... well... they...‚Äù She shivered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure at all how to describe them in a way that would do it justice, but they are terrifying. They stand about as tall as the average Venlil with an inky-black and rubbery hide.They are eyeless, but ‚Äòsee‚Äô with electro and thermal sensory organs in their heads alongside echolocation and a superb sense of smell. The thing that makes them so awful though is their... mimicry.‚Äù

I frowned, ‚ÄúMimicry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes they...‚Äù She shivered again and shook her head, ‚Äúthey mimic the sounds that their victims make. I remember... I remember nights growing up when they‚Äôd prowl around the perimeter fence, just beyond the reach of the lights, making the same screams and pleads for aid that those they had eaten had,‚Äù

I felt my face go pale as the scene played out in my mind, ‚ÄúGood god, I... I thought that the federation *glassed* planets with things like that on them,‚Äù

¬†Berra signed and shook her head, ‚Äúnormally, yes... but planets with a completely miscible biosphere don‚Äôt grow on trees.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see... still... that‚Äôs... ugh,‚Äù I shivered as I tried to push the image from my mind. I searched for something else to talk about for a moment before a realization dawned on me, ‚ÄúBut wait, Tolva told me that Gylen takes Phyli and Helin camping sometimes,‚Äù

Berra looked surprised, ‚ÄúCamping? Here? Certainly not perhaps he meant when they occasionally go to Skelga?‚Äù

Danly waggled his ears and tail at his mother who nodded after a moment with a look of realization, ‚Äúah, yes, of course, of course. I forget that Gylen is a pilot. There is an island perhaps 10 miles off the coast of the sea,‚Äù Berra explained as she motioned with a paw to what I think was the west, ‚ÄúIt is free of predators, save a few small nippy reptiles that prey upon some of the insects there,‚Äù

I chuckled and shook my head, ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs certainly a detail that Tolva failed to mention,‚Äù

Berra laughed, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gotten better about than when he was a pup, but he‚Äôs always had a tendency to omit important details when he‚Äôs excited,‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve known him since he was a pup?‚Äù

She smiled and her tail gave a... nostalgic(?) flick, ‚Äúyep, I remember watching him when he was just a pup. It‚Äôs funny how it doesn‚Äôt feel like that long ago at all even though school -which I attended later- feels like a lifetime ago,‚Äù

I nodded in agreement, ‚Äútime is funny is like that,‚Äù

Berra sighed and turned her head slightly to look towards the door, ‚ÄúSpeaking of time, I should get Danly home so that we can call Camli like I promised we would,‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, of course, suppose I think Tolva will be wrapping up with his sister soon too‚Äù I nodded as Berra picked up Danly, the little tyke pouting as the pad was taken from him and handed to me, ‚ÄúNo more sneaking over, little mister. Get permission next time, got it?‚Äù I scolded the little guy playfully, emphasizing the point with another gentle boop on the end of his snout which got a bashful nod as he hugged himself tight against Berra‚Äôs wool.

She smiled and gently straightened out a few wayward strands of fluff over his forehead before looking back up at me, ‚ÄúThank you for taking care of him, Elanor,‚Äù

I felt my face go warm, ‚ÄúN-no, thank you for being so understanding. I... uh, I *really* should have checked in with you when he showed up at the door,‚Äù

Berra chuckled, ‚Äúyes, without a doubt... but still, thank you.‚Äù

I walked the pair to the door and bid them farewell, waving goodbye to Danly as he waved his little paw at me over his mother‚Äôs shoulder before closing the door.

*Ok, didn‚Äôt catch a kidnapping charge so that went well.*

***After Vosk you‚Äôd think that you‚Äôd question just taking in random children who show up at your doorstep.***

*Yeah... I probably should have learned my lesson, but oh well\~*

I gave one last chuckle and shook my head before heading to the kitchen to get started on the dishes before Tolva was due to arrive.",17,1735978849.0,NatureofPredators,3,1.0,False

I hope my review helps for anyone trying to learn a new language in 2025.

\- from April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working and having a life -

My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.

My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.

What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:

Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.

3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.

4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.

5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.

As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.

If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)

I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",2,1735978813.0,polyglot,1,1.0,False

Comments- The coffee draws down slow on v60(Chestnut C2- 16 clicks draw down of 3:40), but on the flat bottom B75 it draws down pretty fast.

We break up and it hurts so bad ,"English is not my first language and I'm on my phone. Please be easy on me. I just wanna find a place to write this down or I'm going insane. I'm a 28 woman. I live in a small town where everyone knows each other. My father side family is huge. Seems like everyone in this town is connected to my father side family at some point. It's always hard for me to find a boyfriend since I work around children. Hence, almost every man I meet is already married. Until I met him 6 months ago. He's a police officer. He's tall, handsome and charming. I help my father with his bookstore when he's out of town. This handsome police officer walked in, bought a pen and we chatted. That's how we met. At first, I did not think much of that. He's way out of my league anyway. I'm short, not so beautiful and have acne. But somehow, he thinks I'm cute. We exchanged numbers, chatted more and went to have coffee often. We have many similar interests like gaming and books. He asked me to be his girlfriend about a week later. I can still remember the feeling of blossom happiness. We hangout more, we kissed and holding each other hands. I was so happy. Of course I tried to figure out If we're related or not. But my father was out of town at that time. His mother reassure us that we're not related (His father is no longer in the picture and he lives very far away). I really thought that I found my soulmate. 
And then my father came back home. He learned that I had a boyfriend and very happy. But when he met my boyfriend the first time, his smile faded. He was cold towards my boyfriend and the atmosphere was changed. When my boyfriend left, my father asked to talk to me. And that is how I found out. We're distant cousin. My father and my boyfriend's grandfather are cousins. It's so funny because my boyfriend's father lives so far away. We didn't consider him ac having connected to my father side family at all. My father said he knew it right away because my boyfriend looks exactly like his father. 
I called my boyfriend, no, ex, no no, my cousin? that night and we broke up instantly. It was much painful than I thought. I thought I finally found my husband. We were so happy. I could hear him silently sobbing through the phone. We stopped texting. I tried my best to forget everything. But the sweet sweet memories haunts me every night. Thank Goodness that we're both traditional and there's no sex or we would be toasted. That's it. I'm still in pain but I know that time can heal everything. Hope he's doing ok.

My parents have been married for 20 years but for the last 7 years or so, they should have been divorced.

I know, many kids have divorced parents and it's not easy, but this I'd say is worse. They hate each other. They argue every day. And whenever I get some alone time to spend with either of them (say I'm helping my mom or I'm grabbing a coffee with my dad) they just rant about the other.

And today for instance. I was trying to sleep at 10. But yelling. Me and my siblings have made a group chat and we poke fun at it. Sort of a humour to cope with it. We'll say things like ""ROUND 2!! FIGHT!"" and all that. Anyways, I ask my parents to tone it down a bit and my dad tells me, ""No, go sleep in the neighbors house

It's come to the point where the stress has raised my bp to 160. As well as my brothers. How do I know it's the stress? 1. I lead a very healthy lifestyle. 2. When they stopped arguing for about a week or two my bp dropped to 125. In any case it's ridiculous.

My main issue is that they're not role models. At all. I have no idea what to expect when loving someone, or how to behave. Because for as long as I can remember they have been fightng. Well past those 7 years I mentioned earlier. They're immature, they yell and scream instead of using their words properly. And when I see one of my friends with a semi-happy family It makes me wonder what I would have been like if my family was normal.

And because of how preoccupied they've been with each other, they've rarely had much involvement in our lives. Recenlty my mom has started showing me motherly affection but it's too late. I get she realized that that sort of stuff is important but I'm almost an adult. 17 years. All I remember are the bad things. I'm sure there were good times at one point. There are videos of my parents having fun, or us being playful. But I hold no recollection of them. Maybe some automatic response from all the bad stuff. The brain erases all the memories or something.

I'm no degenerate. I will never use this as an excuse to be one. I lead an active lifestyle and I have freinds. I've had a girlfriend. But without that leadership by example I'm lost in romantic relationships. I've had 2 breakups because I haven't been able to handle myself well.

I don't feel cool venting abt this to my friends irl so here I am.",1,1735978551.0,self,0,1.0,False

I'm sure you've probably seen it a million times already, but I would appreciate a bit of feedback on my travel plans.

For context in Canadian, but I've been living and working in Melbourne since 2020 and really wanted to pop around to other parts of Australia. This is an impromptu trip. I'm 30, but very social (but still okay on my own) I'm female and travelling solo. I'll be in Sydney for 5 days and 4 nights from a Thursday to Monday, a little later this month.

I have the option of staying at a hotel in Darling Harbour a flexible amount of nights, (2 min, up to all 4 nights). I was intending on staying at a hostel  at Manly beach for the last two nights (again, flexible). The last day my flight is at 3pm back to Melbourne.

I'm wondering if going up to Manly pigeon holes me into not having much to do other than the beach (which is lovely), but I worry I'll miss out on activities opposite side of the ferry.

What I seek on this trip:
A nice coffee
Tasty food
Relaxation 
Beaches
Basic sightseeing (hopefully not tourist traps)
Socialisation/night life
Potentially a cool arcade 
Art exhibitions
Live music (Techno/raves or RnB)
Photo ops - not so much of myself but of scenery for my DSLR
Walks (around an hour's length)- not overly intensive due to tendonitis

Also, I know this place is probably a tourist trap, but Bondi's Iceberg Pool has been on my list forever. Is it worth going?

Feedback and suggestions are kindly welcome :) Thank you.",2,1735978499.0,sydney,11,0.56,False

Had coffee with my friend last night and syempre pinagchismisan namin mga workmates nya at workmates ko. Pero sa workmates niya ako nagulat.

Dami nya katrabaho na hindi dumadaan sa process ng adoption. Binili yung baby. Literal na binili at may haggling pa nga daw. Wth.

I understand wanting a child pero yung ginagawa nila mali. Child trafficking yun at criminal offense yan!

Yung isa 15k lang daw ginastos nya para makuha yung baby. 

Yung isa sa lying in daw niya nakuha yung baby at gawain na daw ng lying in clinic yung sistema.

Yung isa may pirmahan pa daw sila ng mother ng bata, so feel nyo legal adoption na yan? 

Sa hospital nga daw sila na nag ayos ng PSA nung baby sila na daw agad nakalagay mother at father. Binigyan nalang pamasahe yung biological mom pauwi ng province. Wtf. Masaya ka pa dyan?

Talamak pala sa mga lying in yan. Di ko nakuha yung name ng clinic eh pero Laguna yung isa, yung isa naman sa Cavite, pero may ""factory"" daw talaga sa Las Pi√±as. 

And since wala anak yung friend ko,, niyaya pa sila na gayahin yun. ü§¢

Teh. Government employee kayo. Alam niyo yan na bawal. Sapak gusto niyo? Sayang tax namin sa inyo. Proud pa kayo. Di niyo alam chinichismis na kayo sa trabaho niyo. Illegal mga ginawa niyo.

Mahal adoption. 100k to 200k. Pero sa ganitong illegal na gawain, malamang mapunta yung bata sa mga maling tao at gamitin pa sa krimen.

There are three things I‚Äôve always known:
  One, I‚Äôm claustrophobic.
  Two, magic exists.
  And three, I don‚Äôt belong on Earth.  
  Or maybe Earth isn‚Äôt exactly the right word. It‚Äôs this version of Earth that feels wrong‚Äîthe one with crowded highways, overstuffed backpacks, and grocery stores where nothing sparkles unless it‚Äôs wrapped in plastic. Even the air smells wrong here, like gasoline and stale coffee in my mom‚Äôs truck. I belong somewhere else. Somewhere like Oz, with Dorothy and the Tin Woodman, or the Land of Stories, where anything can happen. Just not here.
  ‚ÄúHere‚Äù is a road trip with my four-year-old sister, Beth‚Äîwho kept the left window open to watch animals, even though it‚Äôs freezing‚Äîin my mom‚Äôs old truck. The truck‚Äôs heater sputters weakly, as if in protest, as we trudge along the empty stretch of road. Occasionally, a snowflake flies in, landing on the edge of my coat or dissolving in my dark brown hair. I huddle deeper into my thickest winter jacket‚Äîa puffy navy blue one that doubles as a suitcase reject‚Äîand let my mind wander.
  The drive from our house in Connecticut to Grandpa‚Äôs itty-bitty cottage on the edge of New York usually takes three hours. Today, though, the roads are unusually clear, probably because it‚Äôs mid-January. Nobody takes road trips in January, not after the holiday rush. Mid-January feels like a neglected middle child‚Äîstuck between the excitement of the new year and the long wait for spring.
