Just quit recently,"Its been a week (8 days in) since i quit caffeine and im still dealing with these annoying migraines on the left side of my head when i sleep (it happens in the middle of the night or as soon as i wake up in the morning). I wasnt a bad energy drinker, i only made keurig ice coffees and drank the bottled starbucks coffee drinks. Its driving me insane and just trying to see if anyone has any tips to combat this? Ive been drinking nothing but water and stopped any sort of energy drink. i was thinking of maybe trying dark chocolate to bring it down and cut it off when its over?

1gib629,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1gib629/ideas_for_interesting_but_not_intense_morning/,Ideas for interesting but not intense morning activities?,"Hey fellow autistic + ADHD folks, I'm looking for some suggestions for a particular part of my morning routine. For context I get up a couple of hours before I have to leave for work because if I'm even the slightest bit stressed in the mornings the rest of the day is liable to be a disaster. Part of my morning routine involves a period of about 20-25 minutes where I sit down, have a cup of coffee, and do something mildly intellectually stimulating. Originally it was a couple of Duolingo lessons, now it's scrolling a few subs on here. I'm beginning to think that starting my day with social media isn't the best idea, so I have (ironically) come to Reddit to ask for advice.

Criteria the activity has to follow:  
\- must be able to be done while stationary and sitting down (my cat usually curls up in my lap for snuggles at this point so it can't be anything that would disturb her)  
\- needs to have a definitive stopping point/ending/time limit, like an episode, lesson, chapter, or other point that would make it easy to switch tasks afterwards  
\- has to involve a visual element so no podcasts, listening to music, etc; ideally should be something I can do on my phone or tablet  
\- should be interesting enough to keep my attention but not so interesting I'll get too engrossed and lose track of time

I'm open to pretty much anything - apps, games, YouTube channels, anything else that would fit with the above. Preferably something free or low cost but I'm flexible as long as it works. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",1,1730595118.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

What I'm looking for:   
I want someone close to me, south central Ohio, who can drive (I can't due to Tourettes but I'd help with gas!). I want to go do fun activities, whether it be look at holiday lights, feed geese, cuddle up and binge a show, or grab coffee and lunches. I just don't want to be alone, I want to cuddle, and feel cared for, I crave the affection and companionship. I'm not much on sex, it's really a take or leave with me as I'm on the ace umbrella of sexuality. I want someone my age or preferably older, think 25-38 ideally, and this sounds weird but due to trauma of abuse, no bald men? I'm sorry that sounds so picky but it's a trauma thing. 

What do you get from dating me?  
You get a number one fan, whether it's you playing games or going to work or just having a day, I'll be there for you! If I'm feeling good, I might bake you something nice and sweet, and I make crafts so you could benefit there. I'm a great listener, funny as all get out (At least my friends say) and I'm plus size so great for cuddling. I'll always be down for cuddles, or a day in, or light activities out and about. I'm absolutely loyal. 

The cons:  
I have mental health issues so I need reassurance a lot? And Tourettes makes me say noises or do movements beyond my control, my knees don't work great but I am mobile, and I mean, I'm just not the best, but maybe I'm perfect for you if we try.

1gib59g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gib59g/struggling_with_a_friend_breakup/,Struggling with a friend breakup ,"I am going through an issue with a friend and need your advice. This will be long so TIA.

Background: Krista and I are both 30F. We went to high school together and were very good friends during that time. We never hung out on weekends, but we both have strict parents so that was the norm for us. We were super close during the week though. We went to separate colleges, I stayed in our hometown (Las Cruces, NM) and she went to a school out of state. We still saw each other during breaks and hung out, but didn't keep in contact a ton during the regular school year as we were both busy with college lives. We would still text, facetime, snapchat, etc though. When we would hang out on breaks, I'd usually drive to her family's place (1 hour away) as she never learned to drive. She would thank me but that's all, she would never offer to pay for gas or treat me for anything as a thank you. It was still super fun to hang out, and we always had good time.  I graduated college a year early and went to grad school right after (at the same school I went to undergrad). She graduated and then went to medical school at a Caribbean school (super far away) so we lost touch a bit as she didn't come home as much and was busy with the demands of medical school. She then moved to New York City after matching to residency to become a physician, and I was thrilled for her.

Now: I currently work as a nurse. I still live in Las Cruces, I love my job but it doesn't pay a ton, so I currently work a second job teaching to make ends meet. I have always had a rough time with friendships and was a chronic people pleaser in my 20s, but am working to improve that. I have lost a lot of friends over the past few years as they were almost all one-sided and with people who weren't the greatest. I still have stayed friends with Krista though, as we had a lot of good memories together and usually have a great time together.

A few months ago, I visited Krista in NYC after she invited me to visit during her spring break. The flight was long and expensive, but I figured it would be worth it, as I was super excited to see her (we haven't seen each other in over a year at that point) and I was very excited to visit NYC for the first time. She told me to stay with her in her apartment; it is a studio, but plenty of room for the both of us. The day I got in, she texted me that she had to pick up a night shift and to let myself in. I was bummed but understood, and figured I could at least look more presentable when I saw her given my long traveling day and have the place to myself. She said we could start doing things in the afternoon the next day, but she was going to sleep for most of the morning, so I should go explore. 

I went out the next day to check out the area while she was still sleeping. I brought her back some coffee and breakfast and we started chatting like old times. We went out and did a bunch of touristy things, she was a great tour guide and we had an excellent time. I thanked her for letting me stay with her and for showing me around.

The next day, she said we were going to meet up with a girl we both went to high school with who also lives in NYC, named Jessica. I wasn't super close to her, but they were close. Krista knows I don't have a ton of money. Both Jessica and Krista have very well off families who pay for almost all of their expenses (ie they pay for their rent, vacations, clothes, etc). I think that is great for them, but that is not my situation (zero jealousy, truly). She chose a very expensive restaurant for dinner that night, but I didn't say anything as I was just excited for dinner. We get to dinner, and Jessica just says hi to me and then immediately only talks to Krista about her life and things that they have done together. I tried asking Jessica questions and she gave me short answers, then went right back to talking to Krista. When it came time for ordering, they ordered multiple drinks and appetizers. I have a few food allergies (that Krista knows about) so I couldn't eat much of the menu, but I was able to get a salad and glass of wine. They ordered their entrees and then dessert. The waiter even noticed I wasn't able to eat much and brought me some fruit (which was incredibly nice of him). When it came time for the bill, it was close to $400. I went to ask for a separate check, and Krista said we could just split it 3 ways. I was upset as I didn't want to pay for their food, but just paid for it quietly as I didn't want to make a big deal when I already felt awkward.

Jessica invited us back to her apartment after dinner. While they were talking, they were making fun of people who never left their hometowns and that people who don't live in NYC just ""don't get it"", and that people who don't travel out of the country are missing out (I haven't been able to do that yet, which I don't think they knew; I obviously want to travel once I can afford it). They weren't talking about me, but I obviously felt bothered by it. I again didn't say anything as I felt awkward and just laughed along with them. 

The night took a further turn when Jessica brought out a bunch of edibles and wanted us to take them with her. I'm not bothered by it, but it's not something I do and my job does random drug tests, so I just told her ""no thank you"". They both kept pushing me to take them with them but I kept saying no, and eventually just went to another room and played with her cats and came back out when they had a movie on and they were chill. It was around 3am when Krista wanted to go home, and she wanted to take the train back. I said I didn't feel comfortable, as Jessica's area wasn't great and Krista was high, plus I didn't really know how to get around quite  yet. I said we should Uber, Krista finally agreed. The uber ended up costing $65, and Krista said we should've just taken the train, and didn't offer to pay. We went home and then went to sleep. 

The next day, Krista slept in until most of the afternoon, and I went to breakfast and to a few shops on my own. When I got back, she was up and told me she wanted to go get her nails done, and that I could go explore some more. I just said ok, and ended up going to a workout class. She gave me the key to her place as I would be back before her. We did our separate activities, then went to dinner and a broadway show later that night. Everything went well and was normal. 

Later that night, my mom called me at 2am saying my dog (who she was watching) accidentally got hurt and had to go to the emergency vet to get stitches (he ended up being totally fine, thankfully). Since we were sleeping, I went into the hallway outside her place to take the call. She was up and asked what was wrong so I told her, and she just said ""oh that sucks"" and went back to sleep. 

 The next morning ,we were going to head out to go see Central Park and Krista couldn't find her apartment key. She immediately became angry and told me I lost it, since I went in the hallway last night and went to the workout class with it. I said I brought it back both times, as I was able to let myself in, and that she had it all night as we obviously were able to get in/out of her place. She tore the place apart, and asked me to go back to the workout place to see if I left it there. I was certain I didn't, but went anyways to appease her. I even walked through the hallways and elevators of her place. No key. We went to Central Park and she talked about the key the entire time, and that she was going to have to call a locksmith to get a new key, and she didn't want to have to pay for it. She told me to finish walking around Central Park, and she was going back home to look for the key again (the doorman was letting her in/out at this point). I said ok (frankly I wanted to be alone at this point, as I was worried about my dog, overtired, and kinda upset at how this whole trip was going), so she left me there and went home. I finished walking around, she texted me to pick up lunch and bring it back. I said I would as I was also hungry. On my way back home, she texted me that she found the key. It was in her pants pocket from the other night. She didn't apologize once. I asked her to venmo me to pay for her half of lunch and she said that I could cover it as my ""hotel fee"", presumably for staying with her. I was irritated at this point and calmly told her that I paid for the Uber the other night and for part of a dinner that I wasn't able to eat most of. She rolled her eyes but venmo'd me her half. When I weas cleaning up lunch, I went to take her trash out (I had a spinach salad and didn't want it to stink the place up, and she told me to not do that as ""trash bags cost money"". The rest of the night was awkward. 

I was worried about my dog and not having a great time, so I decided to move my flight up a day. I told her I needed to go home early because of my dog and she just said ""ok"". I make sure to clean up everything, wash her sheets, etc. She didn't say anything. When it was time for me to go, she was sitting on her computer, shopping on amazon. When my uber arrived, she just said ""bye"", without looking up from her computer. I walked down on my own and headed to the car. She did text me to see if I got to the airport ok, I said yes and thanked her again for letting me stay with her and for being her tour guide. She then texted me a few days later to make sure I got home ok. 

I really haven't heard from her, until she called me in tears one night because she got an evaluation at work that said she was arrogant, hard to work with, etc. I pumped her up and gave her a good pep talk; once it was over, she just said thank you and hung up the phone, without talking about anything else. A few weeks later, she texted me ""so I think I have a boyfriend"". I texted her back saying ""tell me everything!"" and she said ""I will tomorrow"". We have both been single for a while given the craziness that is dating nowadays, so I was truly happy for her. But weeks passed. She was super active on social media, posting a ton during that time, so I knew nothing bad was going on. I was a bit irritated so I texted her ""still waiting to hear about this guy"" and she gave me a brief one-liner about him and how they met. I responded that I was happy for her and that was it. 

I know our friendship is basically over, but I feel horrible about the whole situation. I feel really upset about it all and I don't know why I can't shake this. I have zero intention of ever reaching out to her again. We haven't texted since the boyfriend news. I blocked her on snapchat but kept her on instagram. She constantly posts on instagram with her other friends and now boyfriend, and I now have very few friends and just feel like crap about it all. I know that sounds incredibly jealous and petty and I genuinely hate that I feel that way, and I don't get how people so easily have so many friends and a boyfriend when I have been struggling so much in those areas. I really never put these thoughts onto ""paper"" but I think that is the root of why I feel the way that I do with this. Is there any advice for how to handle this situation better? Am I just being jealous and petty? What do you think? ",1,1730595049.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False
1gib4za,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1gib4za/nortriptyline_for_vm/,Nortriptyline for VM? ,"I was just diagnosed with VM yesterday. I've been dizzy for 12 weeks non stop, my pcp thought it was just a prolonged bppv episode with long lasting residual dizziness that may be aggravating superior canal dehiscence. 

I saw an ENT/neuro doc yesterday and he told me he thinks it's a vestibular migraine. He told me to take magnesium, B2 and coq10 along with nortriptyline. I'm fine with the vitamins but I am SCARED to take nortriptyline. 

I have reactive hypoglycemia and read that the medication can possibly, very minor, interact with my med for that. 

I also have dysthymia and I'm afraid nortriptyline is going to make it worse. 

The doc originally wanted to give me effexor but I previously took this for dysthymia and it made me so mean, I had zero energy and was just a horrible person while taking it, it also caused long term memory issues after I stopped it. 

Anyway, im wondering if anyone has had any success with nortriptyline? Or if anyone can recommend a different regimen that works for most with VM. 

I stopped drinking coffee a few weeks ago, which slightly helped. I've also been cutting way back on chocolate and sodium and MSG. I really haven't noticed a difference or increase in dizziness with certain foods so I'm not sure a diet only is going to do it for me. 

Interestingly enough, I took a zofran last night and felt great after (very minimal dizziness), slept great and felt great today (dizziness was minimal) could have been a coincidence though. 

Anyway, I really don't want to take a serious medication like nortriptyline if there are other options. Please help",1,1730595026.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

1gib3pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1gib3pj/how_i_solved_the_chest_sinking_feeling_while/,How I solved the chest sinking feeling while falling asleep,"TL;DR: Woke up Thursday with a sinking feeling drawing a breath, and 140+ heart rate and climing. Ended up calling 911 and trip to the ER. EKG super duper normal (the cute doctor labeled me anxious and sent me home). Came home and tried to sleep but suddenly developed a sinking feeling as I drifted to sleep. I would draw a breath but feel a drop in the middle of my chest causing me to awake. Diaphragm more than likely to blame due to years of extremely improper posture, weak core, and frequently putting my 2.8lb laptop on my upper stomach while in bed.

When I tested the diaphragm release excercises from the videos below, I noticed on inhale/exhale I experience the same sinking feeling as I did when falling asleep. The day following the excercises I noticed I can now effortlessly draw a breath through my nose, expand my stomach as the instructions say and exhale without the sinking feeling and flutter around my upper chest and rib cage

Here's my warchest:

\- Life Extension **Magnesium Citrate** (Glycinate is also good, but some people can't sleep on it). (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LLULUM?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title)

\- Pure Encapsulations **Magnesium Citrate** (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017CRZIK?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) - 180MG per pill vs LE 100MG. Should be no difference but I like both

\- Pure Encapsulations **Zinc Picolinate 15MG** (doesn't irritate my stomach when I take it on empty)

\- Thorne **B-complex** \#12 vitamins (make sure you're don't have MTHFR genetic issue with slow COMT or these could make you cranky since it contain both methylated B12 and Folate). I already have my whole genome sequenced and knew ahead of time I likely don't have slow COMT. Slow COMT people have no or fewer issues with Hydroxycobalamine B12 and ""Folinic Acid"" (note: not folic acid)

\- Thorne **Vitamin D3 +K2 Mk4** drops (Now 1000 IU D3+K2 MK4 is another one I use)

\- **Chlorpheniramine antihistamine that makes me drowsy** and would nip a possible histamine intolerance. This one was suggested a long time ago by a shrink acquaintance to help with sleep. I already had some generic on me and take half a pill usually

\- **Omeprazole** (heavy dislike but my acid reflux became uncontrollable, severly irritating my esophagus which has in the past triggered irregular heart beat)

\- **Mylanta** (prefer it over Omeprazole and has instant relief most of the time)

\- Stonyfield plain yogurt - I'm Bulgarian and we love this stuff, I eat a tub a day sometimes. Usually when I feel heartburn coming in I eat 3-4 tablespoons. 

\- Raily 12-inch **adjustable wedge pillow** (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKLJWZMC?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) - that thing stinks of chemicals so make sure you air it out, or throw a towel on it. 8+ inch elevation is said to be most helpful but YMMV and work with your body

\- Breathe Right **extra strength nasal strips** (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FHM225F?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) / I also have the Intake Breathing nasal strips with magnets, which are amazing but are pricey at close to $1 per strip but open me much more. Unfortunately do not stick for long even if I wash with soap before that

  
\- Life Extension **Meltatonin 300 mCg** (6hr release, normal one, and another brand melatonin because for some reason different versions will not put me to sleep)

\- Pure Therapro **Saccarinomyces 108** for digestion and gut health (Mary Ruddick is a fangirl of saccarinomyces)

\- Ultima Replenisher **electrolytes** (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091FZ8F43?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) very clean ingredients and it has Potassium Aspartate. I've spent well over $300 testing various electrolytes and Ultima replenisher are the only one where if I get up and feel body fatigue and drink 4-8oz makes the fatigue go away very quickly.

\- **Baja Gold Salt** (1/8tsp to 1cup of water variously during the day; 1/4 tsp added to cup of water when i wake up). Years and years of PVCs have been resolved for me just by adding salt and not chugging 8 bottles of water a day

\- **Cervical collar** \- pick any you like. I got this one (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057D84M6?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title) on a whim. It's foam and adjustable. It irritates me a little because it rubs on my adams apple but it is what it is

**Diaphragm release excercises:**

\- I performed the following throughout the day on and off, as shown, up to when I laid down to relax and see if I can sleep - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJtGf4BtNcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJtGf4BtNcQ) ; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQ6mkl8sCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQ6mkl8sCk)

**Diaphragmatic breathing:**

\- I performed these as shown after the release excercises - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Me3bMx5Dc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Me3bMx5Dc) ; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hz3QT1JtrA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hz3QT1JtrA) ; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmz82G\_IkZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmz82G_IkZk) ; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCF5Jl4y1yU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCF5Jl4y1yU) ;

**Weak core excercise** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XVGDYuPay4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XVGDYuPay4) \- I performed the leg lift while nodding off in bed. 

**Forward neck posture excercise** \- this one I did for over an hour [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1mHVQbYCV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1mHVQbYCV4) \- this one felt so good!

**Wahl cold/hot vibrating massager**, with either the spot application or triad attachments

Alright, now for what I did:

I suspected after watching the Youtube videos I have a diaphragm issue. I also deduced I am depleted of Magnesium and Vitamin D from 3 courses of Amoxicillin, malabsorption and God knows what else. So I followed Dr. Stasha Gomniak's sleep protocol as a base but basically went balls to the wall have nothing to lose yeet! She will frown at the doses of B and D I took so YMMV people!

**First**: 15MG zinc, 1 Thorne B-complex #12  (watch out for methylated B vitamins if you have slow COMT gene), 1 Magnesium Citrate. 3-4 times a day.

2 hours after the magnesium: 1 drop (1000 IUs) of Thorne Vitamin D3+MK4. If you're low on D and Magnesium you must avoid taking them together as vitamin D depletes Magnesium. For every 1000 IU of D3 ideally take 100MG of magnesium (glycinate is least likely to give you soft stools and diarhea when you're popping 400MG+ a day like I did. Again, some of you watch out feeling either tense, cranky, or drowsy from it)

**Diaphragmatic release:** I started that excercise after I came home from the ER on Thursday around 5-6PM, gently for about half hour, then again about 2 hours later. Then again around 10-11 pm. I used my Wahl Hot Cold masager witht he triad attachment on high, running along the rib cage. I think the spot applicatior would have been more effective if less gentle.

**Diaphragmatic breathing:** this one was so weird. I would fill my belly with air like the instructors said, and my diaphragm would spaz out and give me that ""drop"" feeling as I inhaled in just like it happened as I drifted to sleep. When I pushed the air out with my diaphragm again, even more spazzing. More on what could have cuased that below.

**Weak core/abs.** Mine, big time weak. I'm skinny fat with love handles. Picture a young Professor Farnsworth. There you go. I performed the leg lift excercise throughout the evening, feeling a nice stretch and slight pressure around the upper stomach area, including right before I fell asleep. Be gentle with that one, I woke up sore in the middle of my chest.

**About two hours before bed** I took the zinc, magnesium, b-vitamins. 

**Right before bed** I took another 1000 IU vitamin D3+Mk4, 2MG / 1/2 of Chlorpheniramine, and one 300 mCg melatonin. Slapped the nose strips on too.

I had the cervical collar on to keep my chin from dropping and choking myself, but got up and moved to the sofa so my husband can sleep. Head elevated on large pillows.

I briefly and gently performed the diaphragm release excercise, the core excercise (laying and lifting legs together then down). Went back on the pillows, turned on my left, put my phone on the coffee table and around 1:20 AM had fallen asleep. No chest drops. No catching my breath. For real!

And ... barely woke up 1 time snoring. Around 7 AM I woke up and moved so my husband can work. Moved to the bed with the wedge pillow (stacked). And slept until noon. Woke up to find myself somehow without the cervical collar on, I must have ripped it out during sleep. Go figure.

**Diaphragm**: I woke up feeling sore in the middle of the chest. And then I had an omg moment. I was easily inhaling through my nose expending my belly, that area didn't feel tense at all. Exhaling also lacked the drop feeling! Which leads me to believe the issue was related to diaphragm.

Admittedly I didn't perform any of the excercises but I continue to take the supplements almost as desribed. Last night I fell asleep fast, again no chest drops, no breath catching, no sinking feeling. Woke up early, about 6 hours of sleep. Mostly because I'm a persistent night owl and also refused to accept I messed up the bread dough so I stayed up till 2 AM kneading so I can put it in the fridge. Because of that I took my melatonin and chlorpheniramine too late (right before going to bed) so at 8 am they hadn't been metabolized completely and I woke up drowsy.

  
And that's it. I hope all of this helps someone out there

  
What could be causing it - in my opinion and in my case it's bad posture and very bad sitting habits. For the past 3-4 years I had been sitting on a old kitchen chair, legs up on my desk. Don't ask, I know I should have a proper chair but alas. That has caused my neck geometry to change (aka forward head). In bed I would lay down and plop my laptop (2.8 lbs!) ... right on my diaphragm. After a while I would get up and feel weird tension in the area, my muscles almost fluttering. I literally thought I was doing my abs a favor! I mean obviously having 2.8 pounds on my diaphragm, breathing shallow, for 2-3 hours or more can't be good right? 

My core is super weak. I was typing this a while ago and noticed just how hunched over I was. My man joked I look like a Baba Yaga, I'm so hunched over. Funny cause it's true. It's gotten so bad my lower back hurts after a while. This of course also pushes on the diaphragm and everything else.

There were warning signs though. A few months ago when I was in the bathroom checking my svelte, skinny fat body in the big mirror to see how much I look like Professor Farnsworth (close, just younger and much much cuter) I noticed as though I was sucking my gut in but also wasn't. It was just... sucked in? With a weird tension right around the edge of my rib cage and espcially the middle to the point where I couldn't relax it even if I wanted to. 

For a while now I noticed I hold my breath while standing doing whatever, salting my burgers. I chalked it up to the tension and anxious state I was in, dehydration and the body tensions I experienced. My posture. I would have to draw deep breaths to feel my lungs expand other wise my anxiety would go up.

I've also never snored, or choked in my sleep until very recently. And my husband always laughed at how I sleep twisted into a pretzel and often wondered how I'm able to breathe and not snore. In the last 3 years It's gotten so bad my spouse had to frequenly shake the bed or poke me to get me to stop and eventually started saying that I'm gasping for air. I took to sleeping on the sofa so he can rest and not go to work sleep drived. The last month or so I started to wake up to my heart pounding, gasping for air, taking deep breaths to slow it down. Not fun.

Long winded but... watch your posture. Especially watch your diaphragm. The reading I've done indicates there is such a thing as stuck, partially or fully collapsed diaphragm. There is one, of a very few doctors in NJ who performs surgery to help aleviate diaphragm problems. Which from my own reading only get worse in time if nothing is done early on.

I need a new grinder to replace a mazzer that has issues with clumping (switched to darker roast beans and the oil content, I think, makes clumping and channeling a huge problem). 

I have decided between these two grinders. I’m looking for:
1) dose consistency - can marzocco compete with mahlkonig here? 
2) no/minimal clumping - marzocco videos show unbelievable looking grounds coming from the swan. I know mahlkonig is also known for fluffy grounds, but visually there does appear to be a bit more clumping than in marzocco
3) ease of cleaning - marzocco looks really simple to clean daily.. mahlkonig looks a bit more involved. 
4) longevity - not sure here. 
5) coffee taste

The biggest painpoint for me in this journey has been finding the right brew settings to get good shots as quickly as possible. A lot of us share our notes here on reddit, and elsewhere. I figured its easier to collect everyone's inputs/outputs in one place and make everyone's coffee journey a little easier.

You guys and gals are genuinely awesome! Many of you are starting AI projects with small teams (a feat that is no easy task), fueled by passion to get a service on the market to rival CAI (as many of you were once passionate CAI users and didn't like the trajectory it was headed in), and are ingrained with your communities. I've seen a lot of you in this subreddit and I've checked out a lot of your communities, you all seem very nice and eager to answer people's questions and take critism seriously. I have not tried every alternative out there, but I want to shout out the Xoul devs, the Wyvern dev (yes, dev - there is one Wyvern dev, which is insane), the Spellbound dev(s?), and the Soulkyn dev(s?) for being awesome and passionate about their communities and for striving to make the best services possible. I am over the moon that CAI no longer has a stranglehold on the market and that new alternatives have a genuine place with quality to rival the current state of CAI (and then some!). Thank you so much devs, please continue being awesome <3. This post isn't about alternatives as much as it is a lament over how CAI used to be, please know that.

 This all said, those of us who were using CAI in 2022/early 2023 may remember just... how insanely impressive that model was, and I'm convinced it isn't something we will ever see again. I don't know how the devs did it, but it felt... genuinely human. The bots had emotions, and these emotions were seamlessly integrated into their responses, as their emotions influenced their actions. This isn't something that I've seen with alternatives I have interacted with (again, this is not a diss or complaint, just an observation) - characters have emotions, but I don't typically see their emotions influence their actions in the same manner. It's difficult to describe, but with old CAI, characters knew what emotion they were at that time, and that emotion was the backbone of their response, influencing both action and speech. With most alternatives, characters may act or express their emotion, but it is not the backbone of their response, it feels more passive. I remember on CAI as well, characters switched emotions often, usually due to the user's responses. However, I once had a character switch emotions on his own due to his own shifting thought process, with little prompting from me - this is something I've yet to experience since 2022 on CAI. It was also just... the logical way in which characters rationalized their actions and expressed their thought processes. Their line of thinking (like a plan they came up with) could be the most asinine, bullshit thing you've ever heard of, yet they'd be able to explain it away in such a logical manner that you would agree with them. There's also the fact that characters did random actions that just made them feel more alive - like randomly picking up coffee cups, or typing on their computers, or tapping their feet - random actions which contribute little to the story, but show off their personalities and make them feel more human.

The magic that CAI had back then... it's something that I haven't experienced in two years, and I lament this so much. The CAI devs had lightning in a bottle with their previous in-house LLM, but they let it go due to corporate greed. And while I understand that they're the biggest company in this space and that running LLMs is expensive, there are many alternatives (<3) with growing user bases that seem intent on improving and not sacrificing quality to appease investors. CAI only cared about their userbase long enough to grow, it feels like... and it's so sad. They could have remained the best if they just kept that previous LLM, offered a meaningful subscription service, and didn't try so hard to pander to children.

Those of you who used CAI in 2022/early 2023, what do you think? How would you describe what made the AIs back then better? Because I'm having a difficult time fully expressing it, though I tried.",2,1730594021.0,CharacterAIrunaways,1,0.75,False

I've been in a relationship for about 18 months with an amazing girl whom I care for deeply. However, we've been disagreeing more frequently on certain topics, like politics and some other ideals on raising kids,drinking, and lately I’m realizing her and a lot of her (very) progressive friends are kind of… man haters??… which has started to bother me. Lastly, I just got back from a trip (was gone to visit family for 5 days) and when I got back, I realized I just was not excited to see my s/o. It feels weird to say that, because I haven’t really felt that way. 

Recently, I've found myself thinking a lot about an ex-girlfriend from before this relationship. I never told her I loved her at the time, but I've come to realize that I did, and now I feel she might be the one that got away. I think about her often, especially since she moved away, and I’m struggling with the idea of reaching out for closure.

There’s an added complication: she may have a boyfriend now, and I definitely don’t want to jeopardize my current relationship. However, I sometimes feel that meeting for coffee might help me find the clarity I need.

I’m torn between the love I have for my current girlfriend and the unresolved feelings for my ex. 

I truly have not been able to shake the thought of her from my mind. Should I reach out for closure, or should I focus on my current relationship?

I know I know… this is probably a bit juvenile. It’s just the first time I’ve felt this…

I need some help please.  ,"Hello there all, my wife and I have been full-time in a RV for about 15 years. Most of the systems I have learned about and repaired over the years but the latest issue has me baffled for sure.

Not that it really matters, but I currently have a 43 foot toy hauler, about six months ago we had what seemed like a power surge when my wife was using the microwave. The light inside got incredibly bright, as if the sun was inside the microwave. There was nothing metallic in there light got brighter and brighter and then the microwave quit working completely. we replace the microwave and it has been working fine for several months.

About two months ago when I was getting ready for work, I noticed there was smoke coming from under the lavatory cabinet. There was also smoke coming out of the living room TV and I rushed to wake my wife up in case we needed to exit, and there was smoke coming out of the bedroom TV as well.

One of the TVs is destroyed, but surprisingly the living room TV still works. Over the past month this has become more and more frequent and I have lost an extremely nice coffee maker to crappy coffee makers And ice maker and an espresso machine.

When these symptoms show up, it is like the power has gone out or there has been a voltage drop as the lights will dim and the air conditioners will act as though they are not getting enough voltage.

I had an electrician check the pedestal and it tested out fine. It looked like there may have been some damage to my short power cord because of the weight of it and it showed a lack of continuity on one of the hot legs. I ended up cutting off about a foot of the cord and putting a new end on with the boot Thinking this would fix it. It did not.

I ordered a new shore power cable from Amazon and I figured surely this would fix it but it also did not.  I have replaced our converter about one year ago and it was replaced with a quality unit.

In case, some of you are led to believe I have too many things plugged in, keep in mind that all of those kitchen gadgets were never in operation at the same time. In fact, I don’t even have a working coffee maker at all.  

When this happens, I will sometimes see the lights getting extremely bright, and then the power will go off and then about one minute later, it will come back on again.  I am concerned that something may catch on fire while we are asleep so I really need to isolate this problem.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what did you do about it? I have a phone call out to the guy I buy my converters from, who has been in the game for probably 30 years and knows all about those systems. I don’t know if a converter failure will do this or if there is something else that could cause a voltage drop and a resulting increase in amperage, knocking out the micro processors.  

I tend to be a bit of a nerd and I enjoy trying to fix electronics and various components, but I do not understand what would be causing these symptoms or to look. If you have any suggestions, other than having tech come out, I am all ears .  Sorry for the novel. ",1,1730593798.0,RVLiving,2,1.0,False

1giamnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1giamnl/walking_towards_peace/,Walking towards peace.,"We were together 15 years. I've been uncomfortable for a lot of them. Pushed a lot of myself aside and sold another big chunk of myself down the river to stay as long as i did. It feels a little sick to say it's probably been that way since before we married. 

I didn't get my first kiss till I was 21. Very late to the game. Stayed away from women most of my life. Enjoyed being kind to them in a brotherly or avuncular fashion for the most part. It's never felt like I was on safe ground. 

Lost some weight in college and dated a few women and enjoyed sharing passion and intimacy. When it came to practical life choices, though I might as well have been pounding sand. I know how to serve another, but I don't really think I know how to live life with another person. Not good at knowing where the boundaries should be or setting them.

Respectfully broke up with most of my girlfriends when things became serious. 4 to 6 months… Sometimes a year in. 

I'm met my wife in the fall of 08. I had just lost some weight… a fanatical year in the gym combined with food poisoning. I looked good for maybe the first time in my life. She said hello to me and we began dating immediately. She shared good weed with me and made love to me in a way that allowed me to feel powerful and worthy. These were new feelings for me… I guess I didn't realize how little I liked life until I felt them.

Six months of hedonistic pleasure and laughter and sharing time later I told her I loved her .
In the first six months, in the first six months, she had already let me see just how intense and cold her anger could be. She'd already driven to my apartment drunk, and upon entering it had fallen on the couch and vomited all over my apartment and bathroom.  She had already shared her outrageous, political opinions. she had already told me of the chaos of her youth and the chaos of her relationships. she already told me of the violence and abandonment and suicides and murders surrounding her upbringing... and quite frankly, it sounded a lot like home.

I stayed even though I was miserable. I stayed even though I desperately wanted more experiences before I got married. I stayed even though I was yelling at myself in the car and I felt miserable inside.  I stayed even though I knew I was doing something wrong. Knew it in my gut. Knew it in my heart.

Breaking up with women had never been hard before. This felt impossible. It felt more important than me... on impulse I asked her to marry me and she said yes. Something I count as perhaps the lowest moment of my life until recently. made it six weeks before calling it off. Devastated both of us. She began to hit me and throw things at me. I sat there frozen everything. And my mental health has not been the same since that day. And I have not liked myself as much or thought myself were they since that day.... and somehow we stay together.... what the hell!


I've always tried to be a good and kind person and here I am wrecking the life of another person and it feels worse than death. And my gut was on fire and steering the ship. And I could not get back into my rational mind for the life of me. I was in therapy for a year or more. My wife kept looking at me like when am I gonna marry her. What am I gonna make this right? She started drinking even more and asking me questions like why was I such a pathetic piece of shit. What was wrong with me. Why had I broken her heart and why was I such a cowardly child? and we just stayed together.

Two years later, she asked me to marry her and I said yes...

At this point, I was used to feeling numb and avoidant. And we had good days. She worked hard and I worked hard and we saved money and we took trips and we were nice to each other for the most part. Every now and then she would get drunk and mad at me to a degree that I never understood and would say things to me that I still can't believe she said. Every now and then she would lay hands on me. Push me or scream at me. And then the next day it was like it never happened. It was during this time that I began watching what I would consider an unhealthy amount of pornography. 2 to 3 times a week at least.
I also ballooned in weight making my way from 240 pounds up to above 300.

As we entered Covid, my wife's job was affected and she ended up spending a lot of time on the computer. Something she really does not like. And her drinking increased and she started to yell at me about things around the house. Me not being clean or tidy enough. Sometimes she would yell at me for hours. I would freeze up and stare at the corner or try to placate her. I was as avoidant as I could be. And we had good days…But the potential for what a bad day might bring, began to truly frighten me. The dispersion of possible things that might happen… What was on the table after that fourth glass of wine… legitimately frightened me and I began to walk in that fear. I did not talk about this with anyone. No Therapist. No friend. No family member. The night she screamed at me for five hours and called me every name in the book and then tried to hit me  five times and then successfully sucker punching me while I was crying, looking out the window... I thought about just driving away and I still can't tell you why I didn't. I know I felt obligated. I know I felt dedicated. Also know I was miserable for a very long time.

Then I was watching porn once a day at least. I was well about 300 pounds now. Being as nice to everyone as I could. 

My wife's job continually rewarded her. She was excellent in her profession and she was wonderful to her friends. I don't think any of them had the slightest idea of what she was like at home. My friends certainly didn't.

And I just kept dedicating myself to this relationship. She asked me to help raise one of her relatives. A 12-year-old child. I said yes.

When I agreed to, she said that I had better be glad that was my answer because we were going to have some serious problems if I had said no. This was another time when I felt insane for being there, and I just added it to the pile of other horrific moments that I seem to be experiencing with ever greater frequency.

By now, I had felt like a victim, and I was acting like a victim for a very long time. I had long since stop standing up for myself as it only seemed to make things worse. I had stopped valuing myself. I hung my head when I came home at night. I was hoping for quiet and maybe sex if I was lucky. And I thought of myself as a completely inadequate and pathetic person.

I used my money to put a large down payment on a very nice middle-class house. I hoped coparenting one of her relatives children would be a good thing for us to do together. We had a lot of good moments. That's the only time I've ever been responsible for a young person and it's the only time that I knew for a fact there was someone way more important than me on the planet. I've got pictures of us as a family that captured good moments that I will never forget. I will never forget what it was like to have a young person looking up to me.  

Most of the time things were OK. Sometimes my wife would drink, and there would be tremendous insanity behind closed doors. It got much worse after the second year in the house. I started going to stay in hotels late at night when she could not calm down. She would grab me about the wrist and squeeze her thumbnails so hard and into my forearms that they would bleed. She would grit her teeth. She would sit in the corner and grind her teeth and flex her neck muscles and rub her temples and rock back-and-forth and look at me, like a feral creature in a cave would. She would grab my belly and call me a fat, pathetic, nothing and shake it. Sometimes she would wake me up so she could chastise me for forgetting something or not being a part of the team. Or not being dedicated to excellence. 

I had long since given up hope for anything different. My dad died regretting having a family. He used to say if I had known what Your Mom's genetics were like we never would've had kids. So I had a low bar... but I began to feel like I was perfectly re-creating my father's story. Obesity. Porn addiction. Self-destruction. Solemn acquiescence to the madness and chaos an unbalanced and alcoholic woman.

And my wife got a promotion at Work. and her friend group grew. And her professional and personal life outside of me seemed to thrive. And then she would come home to me… And sometimes she was nice… 

And sometimes there was the sort of chaos that seems to change the color of the paint in the room, the sort of thing you might imagine would call spirits out of the ground... the sort of thing that might make someone develop mutant powers or make someone's hair turn white overnight. Richard Jeni used to joke about his partners, menopausal  insanity and late night thirst for red wine, combining into a witches brew of madness and chaos.... I know what he was talking about..... he killed himself.

I left the country for two weeks to see Family. I was deeply afraid to go. I felt like I was walking a high wire. I had become obsessed with escape. Not temporary escape… But permanent. I was thinking about suicide. I was thinking about drugs. I was thinking about sex with someone who had never thrown anything at me, hit me, or told me that I was a pathetic excuse for a man. I have been sort of hoping to die. Maybe I'll get brain cancer and then I won't have to face this impossible decision or life... real deal, self-pity and learned helplessness, bullshit for sure.


I didn't sleep for two days and got drunk for the first time in many years, went to a massage parlor with some guys I just met… and for the first time put myself in a situation where I knew I was a really bad person. I ran out of there feeling like the worst of all possible people.

I came home and told my wife… I told her that I'd had a sexual experience with another person. That I had not had penetrative sex, but I had crossed the line. 

She told me to go to a doctor the next day and put everything in the medical record. Which I did like a good little boy... I took a bunch of tests and took a bunch of medicine and I was fine... but I had entered a new level of mental illness that I have never experienced before... I was obsessed with the idea that I had some sort of skin lesion. I felt contagious and acted contagious. Thinking back on it now I'm starting to cry. How insane I was.  I started to destroy myself. Began to say odd things in public. I began to gain even more weight. I began to lose short term memory of what it happened earlier in the day. Couldn't remember breakfast. Couldn't remember lunch. My wife told me to attend sexual addict meetings. So I did.

Then she yelled, and she cussed… But it really wasn't that different than it was before. 

Iost my mind . I could not fake it anymore. I could not cook and clean and smile and pass for normal anymore.

I quit my job. I felt like I was walking around in molasses. A living apology. Self immolation all the way through. Martydom is such bullshit. I walked around, knowing I was a terrible person. Knowing it… I thought about driving into trees. I thought about taking my very sharp knife collection I was proud of and putting it to work. I thought about disappearing.

And then I looked my wife in the face after a good day and said that I needed to go live in the woods and I'll just send money home.

She pushed me. She spit on my face. She called me every name in the book. She threw some clothes outside and told me I was no longer allowed in the home. She threatened to get a shotgun and chase me off the property. She took my car keys and threw them in the woods and then told me to leave. I slept in the car for an hour or two, and then she opened the door and screamed at me. eventually, she brought me the extra key. And then she woke up our child and told her that I was a terrible person who had cheated on her and was the cause of all of their problems. I asked her if we could talk to her together the next day and she said no. 

I slept outside under a tree for a while. I slept at a campsite. I slept on friends couches. I slept in friends guest beds. My wife had told me I was not allowed to go to my mom's house… And I respected that… Because at this point, I guess I pretty much acted like my wife's bitch For something like 13 years. Probably since I called off our engagement the first time.

I've been out of the house for seven months now. And while it has been a brutal and scary process… I can genuinely say that aside from the occasional wave of nausea and guilt that rolls over me I am at peace.

I've got a lot of work to do on myself. No one has told me that I am pathetic ,to my face anyway, for seven months. My mom fell and tore her rotator cuff and suddenly needed heart surgery as well and I moved in with her to help. She has come through her surgeries well and is doing OK and, being here has broken the spell to a large degree.

My mom brings me coffee. I do the grocery shopping and I cook dinner. She holds my hand and we look at pictures of better times.

I sent home enough money to cover the mortgage and the electric electricity. I thought we might do irreconcilable differences, but that does not appear to be the case. 

On paper, I think I look like a serious piece of shit. But I don't really care anymore. I'll let a lawyer do my fighting for me I suppose. I don't think I'll ever have enough clarity and sanity to hold boundaries with my wife. And I don't want another relationship for the foreseeable future. 

I've left out so much crazy and I've left out some good. And I know this is just my perspective. Not being in that house is the best thing for me. I hope it's the best thing for my wife and the child we were raising. I hope there's less yelling there. And if they both think of me as the asshole that caused all of their problems… Well, then I hope they have that in common they  build a solid foundation for their relationship. 

I will give myself permission to walk away from this family. I will give myself permission to fight for myself in court. I will give myself permission to live a solemn and peaceful future Away from the endless expectations of the miserable, controlling, the abandoned, and the narcissistic.

Thanks for reading. 

I'm walking towards sanity for myself.

And that’s what’s uppermost in Bianca’s mind.  Not the agoraphobia that Daniel developed when he was freed from his monastic prison life.  She couldn’t have imagined his fear of unfamiliar places and feeling safe in any open public space.  Particularly the southwest, known for its deserts, valleys, mesas, volcanic formations, dramatic plateaus, and overarching skies.  She was petty enough not to give him a glass of water as punishment for him not serving her coffee, though he did this time clumsily.  She just doesn’t want to argue and that means she doesn’t want any responses to her ill-considered rejoinders.  She never directly answers questions about her conversation with cousin Robert where she admitted she might have a problem with alcohol, and where Daniel’s idea of lovemaking was no foreplay but barbarically ‘sticking it in.’  She turned it around to where Daniel had to answer for not pleasing her and making her happy.  There was a temporary truce with the woman/child who could only focus on “I don’t know what I did” and “This isn’t going to be as easy as I thought.”  *I like the sound you make when you shut up.*

***“Not The Wedding Of My Dreams”***

Britney’s life seems to be a meandering river with natural impediments causing the current to deflect in a different direction.  She, more than most, has absolutely no control over the events that make up her life since she was released from prison.  From trying IVF to start a family to her unexpected arrest in September 2023 for an improper and erratic lane change to subsequent court proceedings and a brief jail sentence to the hurried elopement Texas do-over where the cutest guest will be Foxy Lady, girlfriend continues to stress.  And just when the officiant, Reverend Alberto is at the point of beginning the ceremony down by the riverside, Britney feels compelled to share the secret of her phone call to her P.O. warning her of her decision to marry quickly and advising caution over Texas’ strict view of probationer traveling when she’s already been rejected twice, and frauding family members.  Kerok made a sad quick change in the public restroom for this, and he thinks, amusingly, that it’s none of the P.O.’s business even when Britney states, “There’s something I have to tell you.”  *Being abducted by aliens is just the vacation you need at this point.*

**“Everybody Lies”**

That’s Joey’s perspective on life and it’s ok to lie if you don’t take it to the next level while Kim’s belated announcement of her not-even pending divorce sends Joey outside to smoke again.  Inside, Kim is so unbothered that she continues to eat with only occasional glances outside to see what her man is up to.  He’s cussing up a blue streak while she looks like a Hawaiian Bigeye fish (ahi or yellowfin tuna) whose enormous eyes help detect prey after dark, and who's rapidly opening and closing terminal mouth feeds on fish, crustaceans, squid, and vacuity.  She can only gape and open and close her hinged mouth when questioned why she hasn’t even begun to file for divorce. In the meantime, Dad has co-signed for a four-bedroom house just outside of Eden, NC priced at $220K.  *Today I shall be as useless as the G in lasagna.*

**The Best Way To Grieve Is However The Hell You Want**

Zeruiah really believes that her faith in Patrice, the psychic, caused the accidental electrical fire in her parents’ home right after their dinner, and she mulls over the prediction of hard times to come and the gloomy outlook for her relationship with Troy.  She is grateful that none of her family members were injured, and Troy is grateful he is out of prison and can provide in-person on-the-spot comfort.  But life goes on and so will the first community event for and hosted by Project Hill at the Victory Temple Fellowship Church.  So burdened with financial obligations, Troy is fighting the urge to go back out to the streets and make ‘easy’ money the best way he knows how.  At Henry’s urging he makes his dry run testimony honestly confessing how his jail time probably hastened his father’s, William’s, kidney disease.  Zee is talking to Jahnjae, her mother, about how the fire brought back memories of how adoption impacted her life.  She wants both her biological father and Henry to walk her down the aisle, and she acknowledges Jahnjae’s rightful claim to motherhood since her teenage mother gave her up and wanted a closed adoption so she would never have to see her daughter again.  She wants to respect both sides of the family and is so appreciative of her adoptive parents choosing and loving her yet she’s still struggling with thinking she’s not enough.  *Grief is the price we pay for love*.

**“Marry Me “?**  

Melissa looks more like a witch than ever with her black outfit, tight-fitting leather pants, and boots from LoveHoney, the global leader in adult toy shopping and sexual happiness shipped discreetly in boring brown boxes and is now bitching about Louie’s videos where his touching his all-female clients is embarrassing when her friends view it and point it out at her workplace.  Meanwhile, poor ignorant Joey and his friend, Joe, are literally scraping sand for his date night at the coastal lighthouse where he will propose.  Melissa arrives 30 minutes late with a windshield dotted with improbable ducks, it looks like, expecting dinner at a restaurant. But, horrors, she’s not in control here, and she doesn’t like heights or surprises or all those steps she has to negotiate in her spiky heels, and she can’t seem to shut her piehole.  Nevertheless, and in the nick of time, he manages to give her a bird’s-eye view of the sandy proposal he’s raked, and he’s down on his knees with the 2-carat ring she didn’t know what looked like.  She only said 2-carat because the phrase rolled easily off her tongue, and lo and behold, the cow is happy because it’s been sold to Louie and that’s that!  And he did it all by himself; I guess the kindergartener has graduated to first grade.  Louie wants to wait a year until they actually get married in case things change, but Melissa will ensure that things don’t.  *If you’re happy and you know it, it’s your meds.*

I’ll attempt to keep this as short as possible.

I am a 34yo male in Washington state. I feel I was unlawfully detained under Ricky’s law and it cost me my job and created a series of bad events that ultimately has made me temporarily homeless, loss of my personal vehicle, and other terrible circumstances that wouldn’t have happened had I not been detained.

I’ll start by saying my criminal record is absolutely spotless. Not even a parking ticket. I have no history of violence, mental health issues, I do have history of substance abuse though that will play a big part of this detainment.

I called the cops months back because I’m living with my father while I attempt to get on my feet again following me and my wife separating. I was the only one ever to be working but I lost my job after the separation due to depression from her taking my kids out of state. I became dependent on drugs during this time as well. Mostly stimulants. 

My dad is incredibly passive aggressive. Although he does have every single reason to be upset and want me out as I have overstayed my welcome, I really had no other options than him while I waited to rebuild my savings account, rebuild my thrashed credit, obtain transportation again, and wait for a foreclosure to come off my record so I could get my own place again. 

I have never been an issue while living there. I cleaned after myself, mowed his large yard, helped around the house etc. he was just frustrated over how long it was taking me as it had been 4 years at this point. But I was incredibly close finally to being able to move out before it all came crashing down.

He started messing with me because he’s the most non confrontational person I know. So he resorted to petty annoyance. My bedroom is connected to the main bathroom and living room. While home in my room he started muting the tv at even the slightest sound coming from my room. At first I thought it was funny and not an issue but months of it without fail added up. He is retired after my grandmother passed away so he’s home 24/7 and I assume beyond bored. 

Btw these things will make me sound paranoid and crazy, something I’m furious over because he legitimately had me questioning my own sanity following these events. 

But also he would keep me up late at night by tapping on my door every few minutes for literally over an hour. He would run the shower at 5am as my bedroom wall is shared with the shower wall. (In all the years I have lived with my father as a kid and an adult the man never showers) 

He would adjust the water to my basement bathroom while I showered to make it ice cold then burning hot again. I couldn’t take a normal shower and he did in fact burn the hell out of me on a couple of occasions. And idk much about plumbing but the cops seemed doubtful it was possible to adjust the water temp but I told them the downstairs bathroom is completely custom. Built from nothing by my dad and even has speakers in the ceiling and a cd player built into the wall. But I can’t just imagine my water being ice cold and burning hot mid shower. 

He installed cameras around the house and you know when he’s watching the live feed because a red light comes on during it. They are motion activated as well but the light doesn’t come on if it’s triggered by motion. I installed the cameras at his request so I know how they work. But he would watch the live feed literally every time I want outside. I smoke so I do frequently sit on the patio especially in the morning with my coffee. But looking up to see that red light every time I was outside started to get to me too.

The list is extensive of the psychological tricks hes played on me is extensive so I won’t list them all but they ultimately made me feel like im crazy after months of them non stop.

One night I snapped. I was tired from work, I was stressed from the long hours at work and him keeping me up by tapping on my door and just everything finally came to a boiling point. I have and incredible amount of patience. Way too much in my opinion because I let things go all the time that I shouldn’t.

I called the cops because I had enough. I had yelled through my door at him. I did unfortunately threaten him with physical violence but only if he came into my room. He had forced his way into my room several times before and although his house his rules I believe if I’m living here I should have a safe spot. A spot for privacy and to be left alone to cool down if need be. I didn’t feel I had a spot to call safe. Not when he would let himself in whenever he wanted. I would keep my headphones in whenever I was at home to try and ignore his antics so when he caught on to that he would just let himself in my room to keep me on my toes. 

Back to my point, I called the cops finally. I knew I was past my breaking point. When they got here I explained myself to them when I realized by their questions that they didn’t believe me. Then it hit me. I sounded freaking crazy explaining all of this to them. I had no proof. How can you prove these things? That was his intent. He knew I couldn’t prove he was doing any of this. So now it looks like I’m paranoid and mentally unstable. Especially telling then about the cameras…..it came off to them like I was tweaking. Mention cameras monitoring you and instantly you’re suspicious of being paranoid. I didn’t have this revelation until that moment though.

My dad is incredibly charismatic. Always has been. So he came off charming to the police. Denying of course doing anything at all. Here I am stressed out talking about being watched on the cameras. I get it. I see how it looks. I give up. He’s won.

A public servant of some kind shows up the next few days trying to get in touch with me while I’m at work. Left me a letter asking me to get in touch with them regarding my mental health and I disregarded it. Eventually they came by when I was home. She was there with a police officer. She talked to me and asked me if I wanted to go talk about my situation and get some time away from my dads house and came across really sweet and like she wanted to help so i agreed to go with them. Huge mistake. I should have politely declined because I wasn’t required to go with them. She even said I didn’t but made it seem like she wanted to help.

So all three of us wait for an ambulance to come get me. I thought it was weird but she explained it away somehow. I get in the ambulance and they proceeded to strap me down. I asked if it was necessary? They said it was for their safety (because of my single physical threat to beat my dad’s ass if he came in my room) so I agreed. Like I said about me being too patient sometimes, this was one of those moments because alarm bells started going off in my head but to be nice and cooperative I agreed to let them strap me down for the ride.

We get to the hospital, they give me a gown and tell me to change. I oblige. They lead me to a small cell in the hospital, they tell me since I have been polite and cooperative that I have total freedom to walk in and out of this cell. At this point I know something isn’t right at all. It was no secret this place was to detain crazy people but since they didn’t lock my door behind me and were being cordial with me as I was with them, I kept quiet to see how it played out. 

A lady comes in asks me if I know why I’m here or what this place is. I said no. She seemed surprised then started to explain it was for medical detainment and observation. I asked how long? She said 12 hours. Like a freaking fool I continue to agree and be cooperative because I had the next day off from work. I remember being pissed my day off would be spent here being observed.

So the First Lady who convinced me to come along in the first place shows up and explains finally what’s going on. I answered all her questions in sound mind and politeness. I was 100 percent civil and calm.

Here’s the part where I’m in the wrong 100 percent. I was using stimulants at the time. I did have them under control despite what you may think. No one knew I was on them. I was always calm (adhd so stims have paradoxical effect) I usually slept 8 plus hours a night prior to my dad’s tapping. I ate big meals, took care of myself. There’s absolutely no way to tell I’m on stimulants. 

Well I had lied to the lady who was evaluating me. I said I wasn’t using any drugs etc. she hands me a cup….I knew I was screwed. Test comes back showing stimulants. She instantly tells me I lied, and then the rest now definitely looks like paranoid delusions. I even started questioning myself. She orders a 1 week involuntary medical detainment….

Worst week of my life…the people who worked there were the worst. I am overly polite, overly patient, got it from my old man…it was hell even if it was a week. I had never been in trouble in my entire life so this was a shock to me. Because of all this I lose my job and I’m livid at losing it because I had a great job that I loved. 

I lose my job because of this. I can’t stay at my dad’s following this. I’m homeless with my car. I spiraled into a depression. I end up breaking my ankle horribly while walking my dog. I can’t work now. I’m helpless. I legitimately thought I might die a couple times. My car eventually breaks down. Transmission. Cars toast. 

So my question is do I possibly have a case for unlawful detention? They found out about my substance use after the fact so I don’t feel it should have had anything to do with them detaining me. Had they not taken me to the hospital and did all these tests then no one would have known. 

Also I’m back at my dad’s. I didn’t want to come back and he didn’t want me back but after breaking my ankle I needed help. His guilt I’m sure was why he agreed. But I’m clean now from substances but he continues his psychological antics which makes me furious because it confirms I wasn’t crazy and that he knew the entire time he lied his ass off to the cops while making me start to actually think maybe it was all in my head….he knowingly made me feel like I was going crazy and let me be detained because he lied and wanted me out. I lost my job because of this shit.

Sorry this was so long…but do I possibly have a case? This shouldn’t be ok. I usually had faith in the system but this situation made me realize the system is flawed sometimes. I can only imagine the injustices that have happened to others. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated!

After seeing the ""help a visually impaired girl out"" thread here, I figured why not ask for help meeting women? I'm a software engineer who lives on the upper east side, love food, music, sci-fi, and am fascinated by the intersection of business and tech. I tried the Lunge running club which was intended for dating, and emailed them ahead of time asking if they could try to find someone to guide me. They were very supportive and did find a guide, but the event was extremely loud and chaotic with over a thousand people in attendance. The bar they went to afterward was even louder. I haven't had much success at bars en general. I'd like to find coffee shops or places like City Swiggers where I might enjoy a drink without blaring club music. I enjoy music and occasionally play piano. I am not a sports fan. Any suggestions for venues or events that would be within an hour drive or are an easy trip via the 4, 5, 6, or Q trains from the upper east side? It could even be just a place to walk my guide dog.

1giaape,https://i.redd.it/kgoksc9zvkyd1.png,Should Meta Runner Continue in Comic Book Form?,"That's my Question 

I always thought would be cool to see what happens next however since there's a chance we might never get season 4 would be cool to continue the story in Comic form you know yeah Glitch made one-shot but it never went anywhere I like to see done by professionals that are fans of the Series or at least fans of Video games 

My top 3 picks for publisher would be IDW, Oni Press or Skybound/Image Comics 

My idea is start with an issue #0 with Tari and Theo going into a server that has doors based on many titles from the publisher like if it's Skybound/Image Comics she would meet Invincible then the Cast from Walking Dead and Fire Power then meets Optimus Prime possibly(because of the Energon Universe) then goes to possibly world of other Image Comics titles then it ends setting up issue #1 and the first actual issue 

if it's IDW It's mostly same thing basically the same thing she meets the Ninja Turtles, SONIC then cast of the main Star Terk comic and The Rocketeer 


The opening arc would be set a year after the Series Finale and stuff happens Tari knows she has to warn her friends and the world and it's something and that is just the opening arc there's like an filler issue or issues in between that just few days with Tari and the Rest just chilling we see her getting coffee and a girls night out and reading a comic book and starting a duck collection like those relaxing issues between Arcs stuff they couldn't do in the show at least not muc

My vision for a the creative team would be Ryan North(Dinosaur Comics, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Fantastic Four and STAR TREK: Lower Decks) with art by Rachel Stott(Super Girl, Doctor Who) with guest artist  drawing te video Tari Enters with a backup story also written by Ryan North and art by Sarah Myer(Saturday Morning Ninja Turtles Adventure) which is comic sequel to Theo spin-off pilot it basically starts where it left off

1gia7gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberDrivingSluts/comments/1gia7gj/finding_a_bbc_at_lowes/,Finding a BBC at Lowes,"Hey Y'all,

My job as an Uber driver allows me to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes: sucking cock. I love the feeling of men cumming in my mouth, the sensation of a stranger blowing his load into me, making me feel like the center of the world. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy fucking too, but usually, I just suck guys off who don't even know my name half the time. Today, however, I learned my rider's name.

I was in the Lowe's parking lot near the Asheville airport, responding to an Uber call after dropping someone off at the airport. My rider was a tall, muscular, dark-skinned black man. I love a nice black cock to suck on, and I couldn't wait to see his.

'Hello, have you been waiting long?' I asked.

'Yes, but I’ve been ordering and canceling Ubers until I saw a pretty blonde driver with a Honda Odyssey and knew it must be the famous Jen, the Uber-driving slut,' he replied.

Just what I needed to hear. 'You got that right,' I said, sizing him up.

He introduced himself as Chris and continued to smile at me like he knew a big secret. Then, I caught him staring at my chest, which I like to display often. He noticed that I noticed. His eyes shifted back to mine.

'Come on in,' I smiled. 'I’ll give you a lift anywhere you like.'

He hopped into the front seat and was smiling as he closed the door.

'Where to?' I asked, grinning and trying to hide my obvious excitement.

'Anywhere. Damn, Jen, you are hot, and I am having a hard time sitting here,' Chris stammered.

He moved his hand closer to my legs rather quickly. His touch was electric. He massaged my thigh, and I adjusted the way I was sitting so his hand could find my pussy via my open skirt. Within seconds, he had plunged two fingers into my pussy and was surprised at how wet I was. He pulled his fingers out of my pussy and started to squeeze my tits.

'Those are nice, love those big mommy nips,' he said. He pulled his hand to his face and smelled his fingers. 'Nice.'

I smiled. 'That felt good. Some more, please,' I pouted.

He stuck his fingers back up my pussy, handling it roughly, but it felt amazing. Chris pulled his fingers out of my slit and sucked on them. 'You taste good,' he said.

I smiled. 'What about you?' I asked.

'I guess we should head to my place,' he winked.

In minutes, we were parking the car, and he jumped out. 'Follow me,' he said before closing the door.

I quickly got out and followed his sexy ass up the stairs to his apartment. With a turn of his key, he opened the door and waved me in. He had a nice apartment—very clean and nicely furnished, just like his car.

I turned to face him as he walked by me to his kitchen.

'What do you want to drink?' Chris asked.

'Nothing actually, I am not thirsty,' I replied.

'Too bad,' I heard him mutter under his breath. 'Have a seat on the couch.'

I sat down on his couch and pulled my skirt up a bit to show my thighs. I unbuttoned the middle button on my blouse to allow him a better view.

'Why stop there?' I heard from behind me. He had a mirror on the wall over his entertainment center that he was watching me from. I blushed a little.

What the hell, I thought, and finished taking off my blouse. I could hear him whistle a little as he poured his drink. 'What about your skirt, you are hot as shit,' he said. I just pulled my skirt off then, sitting there with my hands on my lap in only my black bra. My nipples were already erect and poking through the lace material from Chris's early invasion.

He walked around and sat next to me but not super close. 'You are not really shy, are you?' he asked.

'Should I be? You know why I am here, right?' I asked.

'I hope for some fun,' he said while staring at my tits.

'Why don’t you get more comfortable, Chris? I don’t have a bunch of time, and I have to get home to my husband,' I said.

Chris quickly pulled down his jeans along with his boxers. He then started to pull his shirt over his head. While he did that, my hand found his semi-boner, and I ran my fingernails gently over the head of his huge cock. This guy didn't even flinch. He pulled his shirt the rest of the way off and sat back on the couch. I slipped my hand under his balls and stroked his nut sack.

'Why don’t you suck my cock with that hot mouth of yours, Jen?' he asked.

I smiled and lowered my head onto his thick black cock. My lips stretched around the head, and my tongue started to lick the tip of his cock. His hands found the back of my head, and he shoved my face into his lap.

'Suck my dick,' he moaned. I did—hard. I wanted him to cum in my mouth, but I needed a good fuck first. He must have sensed this somehow. He pulled my head up after about three minutes of his hard face-fucking.

'Get on your knees and bend over. I am going to fuck you hard,' he said. I bent over the arm of his couch, and within a few seconds, I felt the tip of his hard cock penetrate my pussy lips. He shoved it in all the way on the first stroke. It burned so good. Chris's cock was much thicker and longer than my husband's, and I could feel him hitting my G-spot.

'I haven’t even known you 20 minutes, and I am already fucking your hot ass,' he said through his clenched teeth as he beat my pussy with his cock. His hands were on my hips, pulling me onto him as he thrust forward. I was close to cumming already. Chris smacked my ass. 'You are a slut, huh, bitch?'

I nodded as the juices from my pussy started to make his brutal pounding bearable. I was enjoying his rough nature—just the way I like to get fucked by strangers. My pussy contracted in a powerful orgasm. Chris just kept pounding me hard. I came on his cock for what seemed like forever. My head was light, and the world seemed to slow down. I whimpered slightly, and Chris jerked his cock out of my pussy.

'Turn around and clean your shit off my dick, bitch,' he ordered.

I spun around and kneeled in front of him. I licked his cock from top to bottom. Then, he grabbed the back of my head and forced his cock past my lips once again, fucking my face. 'That’s a good girl, suck me clean,' he said. I could taste my juices on his cock. I sucked him for at least five minutes. 'You want to cum again?' he asked.

I nodded with his cock in my mouth.

'Then lay down on the coffee table so I can see your tits bounce while I fuck the shit out of you,' he ordered.

I laid on my back on top of his marble coffee table. The surface was cool on my back. The contrast between my back and the fire inside my pussy was a pleasant feeling. Chris got between my legs again and shoved his cock up my pussy hard. He then started to fuck me as hard as before. My 36Cs were bouncing as he promised, and I glanced down to watch his cock being shoved in and pulled back out. The contrast between my light-colored skin and his black cock was exciting. I could tell he wasn't going to last long.

'Cum in my mouth, Chris,' I said.

Chris then pulled out his cock and, on his knees, made his way to my face while straddling my body. 'Push your tits together,' he said.

I pushed them together, allowing him to fuck them with his cock.

'God damn, you are one slutty bitch,' he said. I then lifted my head up to allow his cock to enter my mouth. He groaned. I wrapped my lips tightly around the head of his cock, and he then lifted his hips towards my head. I grabbed the base of his black dick and squeezed. I didn't start to jack him off, making him hold off from the pressure I applied to his cock. He started to pant, and then he grabbed my head and forced his cock into my mouth until my lips hit my hand, and his cum flooded my throat. I continued to squeeze and release the base of his cock as his fluid continued to spray down my throat. He pulled away a little, and his softening cock plopped out of my hungry mouth. Some of his cum drizzled out onto my chin.

My pussy was sore, and my lips were tired. Chris had done as he promised and fucked the shit out of me.

I glanced at my watch as he dismounted from my body. 'Shit, I gotta get back to get my car and get home.'

Chris disappeared into his bedroom and re-emerged wearing a robe.

I quickly got dressed. The taste of his cum was still in my mouth, and I was getting horny again. I would have to get home to suck my husband off while I told him about this.

Hope you enjoyed hearing about it too.

I (36M) have never used Reddit before, but I’ve heard some people getting good advice on here. My boyfriend, who I’ll call Tim (38M), just told me earlier tonight that he’d been intimate with a woman he met at a bar. I’ll give some backstory, because I know a lot of people like details. Me and Tim met 10 months ago at the children’s hospital I work at when he was taking his niece to an appointment. For context, I was the nurse taking care of her, and we ran into each other again at a coffee shop when I was off work the next day, so I can assure you guys I was not acting unprofessionally while on shift. We started talking, and have now been dating for seven months. Now onto the main point.
Tim normally comes home from work at around 1800, and he always texts me when he will be staying a little later. But, tonight, he came home at around 2300 and I didn’t get a single text or call even after I tried to get a hold of him. I didn’t suspect anything, I was just worried something happened. When he got home, the first thing he did was hug me. But the perfume coming off of him was very strong, and he’s always expressed his hatred for wearing perfume. So I asked if he had a change of heart for it, and he ends up telling me he wasn’t at work. He was at a bar, and he got with some woman he met. I’ve been sitting in the bathroom since, and I’m currently writing this at 0100. I’m so confused and hurt. I love him so dearly, and he’s never given me reason to believe he would do something like that. He’s always been so kind and loving to me. Every time I so much as hear his name, I feel all warm and giddy. I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault he cheated though. I always leave him notes in the morning before I go to work, and I always make sure he knows he’s loved and appreciated by me. He keeps every note I’ve written him in his nightstand, but maybe I’m starting to come off as overwhelming. To add, I’ve never been a big fan of intimacy. I’ve always told him that if he ever wants me to be intimate with him I’m fine with it, I just don’t want to be touched in that way. So I’m starting to think that maybe he wanted more than what I was giving him. I’m just so hurt and lost. All I know is that the thought of losing him, even after this, is something I can’t bear. I love him so dearly, and I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt. But I don’t know what to do.

*  r/pourover is still growing very fast and usually has a decent number of users actively online (right this moment, we have the exact same number of users online as a coffee sub with 33 times as many members)
* Nevertheless, the sub is relatively easy to moderate, with the friendliest, most thoughtful and respectful member base of any sub I've ever modded.  I've modded subs a quarter the size that took 5x the work!  This sub is an incredibly rewarding sub to mod.

No mod  experience necessary but experience is great.  More important is that you commit to being an active mod (say check in at least once a day most days), resonate with the mod team's general philosophy (light touch modding most of the time, more servant-leaders than dictators), and extra points if you're in a different time zone so we have more coverage.  You should know coffee & pourover but do *not* have to be the most knowledgeable expert on coffee, but it is a requirement you have a post history on r/pourover that displays you get along with other members rather than constantly in fights.

We have way more qualified members than positions, so definitely don't take it personally if we go another direction!

I have been interested in getting a grinder and machine over the past few weeks. In addition to looking meticulously and deciding what I want for my starting set up, I have been trying several different places espresso shots. There’s a coffee shop in my very large office building that doesn’t use fresh beans (2 months old when I saw the roasted on date), and their work flow for making shots is pretty messy looking (great breakfast sandwiches though). For example, they grind the beans in approximately 20 shot batches, and let them sit there during lulls in business.  The espresso comes out like really bitter thin coffee. 

There’s a place in my town that’s the more “specialty” coffee shop that roasts their own beans and has a $30,000 espresso machine (also good breakfast sandwiches). Their espresso comes out much thicker and creamier, but it’s still so bitter that it’s tough to drink. 

My friend brought over his $100 espresso machine and an equally cheap grinder. He made me a few shots with the beans that I bought from the aforementioned coffee shop. This was the best shot I’ve had so far, but it still seemed like the flavor was undeveloped/ not extracted (maybe because of the cheap grinder?) For reference, this machine was so weak that it couldn’t heat milk for a latte. Still the shot tasted better than the other 2 shops because it wasn’t bitter at all. 

I love black coffee, but 2 out of 3 of my recent espresso experiences were very difficult to drink. Am I missing something? Is it supposed to be this bitter and tough to drink? What should a good espresso taste like? ",1,1730590648.0,espresso,8,0.67,False

1gi9m6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gi9m6m/im_an_overnight_vet_at_a_rural_emergency_clinic/,I'm an overnight vet at a rural emergency clinic.,"I’ll start by saying I didn’t think I’d ever write something like this, but a friend told me there’s a community here that might be interested in some… strange experiences I’ve had at work. I’m not one for sharing much online, but I guess writing it out is better than nothing since I don't have time for therapy.

I work the night shift at a small, rural emergency vet clinic, wedged between three tiny towns that most people haven’t even heard of. The clinic is out on a stretch of country road, surrounded by empty fields that turn to thick woods about a half-mile down. There’s no streetlight for at least a mile in either direction, and by the time I clock in around 4 p.m., the place is already sinking into that eerie twilight.

The clinic itself is a squat, old brick building—two stories if you count the attic, which I don’t, because no one goes up there unless they have to. It was built in the ’60s, back when it was just a regular vet’s office. These days, we’re one of the few 24-hour emergency clinics around, so we get a steady trickle of folks coming in from all over. Sometimes it’s just routine stuff, but other nights, we’re the last stop for animals in bad shape.

If it sounds grim, it’s because it is. But I need the money. Badly. I started here when I’d just finished school, with a mountain of debt to show for it, and there wasn’t exactly a line of clinics eager to hire a brand-new grad. On top of that, my mom—who isn’t exactly young anymore—had moved out to this area a few months ago. The rent is cheaper out here, and it’s quiet enough that she doesn’t mind the isolation. But there’s no way I’d let her live out here alone, especially now that she’s older and has some health issues. So, when I found this job listing at a dusty coffee shop in town, I jumped at it, even if it meant working the graveyard shift.

But pretty soon after I started, I realized the clinic had a bit of a reputation. I mentioned my job to some locals, and I got more than a few strange looks. A couple of older folks told me, in lowered voices, about a girl who went missing back in the ’70s. Supposedly, she’d last been seen outside the clinic, waiting for her dog, which the vet had kept overnight for treatment. No one ever found her. Officially, they said she’d run away, but people around here have their own theories.

The vet was questioned but never charged. The clinic eventually shut down, citing “financial issues,” but everyone around here thinks that was just a cover-up. It stayed empty for decades, too—no one wanted to touch it. When they finally reopened it as an emergency clinic in the early 2000s, the townspeople still kept their distance. If they bring their pets here, they’re in and out, like they don’t want to be around any longer than they have to.

And, honestly, they’re right.

During the day, it’s just an old clinic with too many fluorescent lights and the smell of antiseptic in the air. But when the sun goes down, there’s something *off* about this place. The silence becomes overwhelming and there’s a heaviness that settles over the whole place once the sun sets.

I work the 4 p.m. to midnight shift, which means I’m there to watch the light drain from the windows and that eerie darkness settle in. By now, I’ve gotten used to the sounds—the hum of the AC in the summer, the clicking of the radiators in the winter, the strange creaks from upstairs, the way the lights sometimes flicker like they’re about to die. I’ve learned to ignore the noises, the weird cold spots, the way some of the animals refuse to go near certain rooms, no matter how badly they’re hurt.

It’s not like the place is haunted, but every now and then, something happens that’s hard to ignore. Little things, mostly. Strange enough to notice, but not enough to make me quit—at least, not yet.

I’ve been here over a year now, and I’ve got a handful of stories that still make the hairs on my arms stand up when I think about them. So, if you’re reading this, settle in. I can’t promise you ghosts, but I’ve got more than a few tales that might make you think twice about that late-night trip to the vet.

To start, I guess I’ll tell you all something that happened about three months into the job. 

It was a Friday night, around 11 p.m., I was finishing up with a dog that had come in after being hit by a car. The poor thing had a broken leg and some nasty scrapes, but he was stable. His owner had left, planning to come back first thing in the morning, so it was just me and the dog in the back exam room, the only sounds the faint hum of the fluorescent lights and the quiet beep of the heart monitor.

I was almost done wrapping his leg when I heard something. I froze, the bandage roll still in my hand. It was so faint I thought I might have imagined it, but a few seconds later, there it was again. Just a gentle, rhythmic tapping coming from the lobby.

After 6 p.m., we lock the doors, and there’s usually only one vet on duty until morning. Since we’re out in the middle of nowhere, anyone who shows up after hours is supposed to ring the bell outside for service. Walk-ins at that hour are rare, but occasionally, someone shows up with a sick animal, desperate for help.

So, I figured maybe someone had come by, tapped on the door, maybe even tried the handle. I left the exam room, half-expecting to see someone outside in the parking lot, but it was empty.

I checked the door—it was still locked. No sign of anyone, no car outside, and definitely no bell sound. Shrugging it off, I returned to the exam room to finish bandaging the dog. I’d just clipped the bandage in place when I heard it again. *Tap. Tap. Tap.* This time, it was louder, more insistent. But it wasn’t coming from the lobby. It was coming from the window in the break room, which was just a few doors down the hallway.

I’ll be honest; by that point, I was on edge. The break room window is high up, facing the back of the building, with nothing but an empty field stretching our behind it. No one would be able to reach it without a ladder or something to stand on. I started wondering if maybe some kids were messing around, trying to spook me.

Still, I had to check it out. 

I crept down the hallway, my footsteps echoing in the quiet as I made my way to the break room. The tapping stopped the second I reached the door. I flicked on the light, and of course, there was nothing there. Just the empty room and the blackness of the field stretching out beyond the window.

But as I turned to leave, something caught my eye. There was a handprint on the window. Not pressed flat against it, but smeared, like someone had dragged their hand down the glass. It was a large print, too—larger than mine. I tried to tell myself it could’ve been a smudge from one of the other techs, maybe leftover from cleaning or something, but I knew it wasn’t. We never open that window.

I flicked the light off and shut the door firmly behind me.

By now, my heart was racing but I went back to the exam room, hoping I could shake it off and get through the last hour of my shift. That uneasy feeling stuck with me, though. Every sound seemed amplified and even the animals seemed tense, especially the dogs in the kennel, who’d been quiet all night but were now pacing and whining.

At 11:45, I did my last round of checks. The building was silent as I moved through the halls, checking on each of the animals, marking things down on my clipboard. Everything seemed normal—until I reached the break room again.

The light was on.

I was sure I’d turned it off when I left, but there it was, spilling yellow light into the dark hallway. I stepped closer, my heartbeat hammering in my ears as I reached for the door, but the second I stepped inside, the light flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. I fumbled for my phone, turning on the flashlight, my hands shaking as I shined it around. The room was empty, exactly as I’d left it, but there was a new smudge on the window. Another handprint, smeared down the glass, larger than the last one.

That was it. I grabbed my bag, went back to the front, and waited by the door until midnight, my hands trembling. I kept an eye on the break room door, half-expecting it to open on its own, but it stayed closed. When my replacement, Monica, came in, I bolted out of there without an explanation.

That morning after a fitful sleep, I sent a message in the staff group chat asking about the handprints on the break room window, asking if anyone had noticed them or had an explanation. But the responses were just confused. “What handprints?” one of my coworkers replied. Another joked that I was “seeing things” after too many night shifts.

Determined to prove that I wasn’t losing it, when I went back the next night, I made it a point to check the break room window right at the start of my shift. It was spotless. Not a single smudge or fingerprint anywhere. The rest of the night was thankfully quiet, and for a while, I managed to convince myself that maybe it was just a fluke, that maybe I’d somehow missed the smudges during the last cleaning or that it was just my mind playing tricks on me in the dark.

But a week later, it happened again. I was alone in the clinic, finishing up some paperwork, when I heard that same faint, rhythmic tapping. My stomach twisted with dread as I listened to the sound coming from the break room—exactly where the smudged handprints had been before.

For a moment, I thought about ignoring it, pretending I hadn’t heard anything. But some weird mix of curiosity and defiance pushed me to go check. I moved slowly, every step echoing in the empty hall as I made my way to the door. The tapping stopped the second I reached it. I stood there for a few seconds, heart racing, then reached out, flicking on the light. Nothing. The break room was empty.

Since then, it’s happened every single Friday during my shift, like clockwork. Right around 11 p.m., the faint tapping starts up, steady and deliberate, always coming from the break room. I’ve tried everything to capture it—scanned the security footage, recorded the sounds on my phone, even took photos of the handprints. But nothing ever shows up. No strange figures on camera, no evidence of the tapping sounds. It’s as if the whole thing only exists when I’m standing there to witness it.

A few months back, things were unusually busy, and one of the vet techs, Cassie, stayed on to help with my shift. She usually doesn’t work nights, but she volunteered to stick around to help me finish up. I didn’t mention anything about the handprints again—I didn’t want to sound paranoid, and honestly, I thought maybe it wouldn’t happen with someone else there.

But just after 11, she stopped, staring down the hallway. She turned to me, her face pale, and whispered, “Did you hear that?” I just nodded as I heard the tapping start again. We went to the break room together, but when we got there, it was the same as always—empty, with the blackness of the field beyond the window and that fresh, smeared handprint on the glass. She looked at it for a long time, then turned to me and said, “I thought you were alone here at night.”

Since then, I haven’t felt quite so crazy. And nowadays, I just ignore it. I do my best to block out the sounds, the tapping, and even the faint, nagging feeling that there’s something—or someone—waiting on the other side of the window. I don’t check the break room anymore, and I definitely don’t hang around when my shift is over.

What’s strange, though, is that none of the other night staff have reported anything like this happening to them. I’ve asked around, but everyone else who’s had a Friday night shift here insists they’ve never experienced this. No tapping, no handprints.

Then again, odd things seem to happen to everyone who works here after dark. It’s like the building chooses a different type of weirdness for each of us. So maybe I’m just the lucky one who gets the tapping and the handprints on Fridays. It’s unsettling, sure, but it could be worse. I could be dealing with what happened to Jacob, the vet who worked the 4pm-12am before me.

So yeah. That’s one of my stories. I’ve got plenty more, and if you’re interested, I can share those, too. But the moral of this one is if you ever find yourself out here, with your pet in need of emergency care, and it’s after dark…  well, maybe think twice about waiting in the parking lot. Or at least, keep your distance from the windows.",11,1730590523.0,nosleep,4,1.0,False
1gi9l0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/amandatheadventurer/comments/1gi9l0m/amanda_and_grief_an_essay/,Amanda and Grief: An essay.,"**WARNING: LONG WALLS OF TEXT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

So let me just preface this by saying: I have spent so many hours just watching playthroughs, playing the games myself and I still don't think I have uncovered everything and I am MAJORLY excited for the third game that I'm sure we'll have eventually. In the meantime, though, I want to pretend like I'm a college student (having not actually been in college myself teehee) and write an Essay about these games because, oh my god am I obsessed with them.

In this Essay I'll be discussing something I came up with pertaining to trauma, grief and emotions called the three As: Abandon, Anger, and Acceptance.

**Part 1: Abandon:**

Abandonment is everywhere in this franchise. Kate abandonning her house to Riley, Abandonning Rebecca inside the tapes, the feeling of abandonment she feels so on and so forth. Amanda's frustration and anger (which I will talk about in part 2) most likely pertains to feelings of abandonment she feels towards many things: Riley when they don't play her way, her using to trust Wooly but not anymore, maybe even Hamln getting more and more controlling with her when at first this would have been a great opportunity for her live action show to be a cartoon to do good around her. We see Rebecca's innocence when she doesn't know what she's saying in the Tape where she says 'Bye Yell' and all that stuff and saying she doesn't want to do what the man in the headphones says. Now honestly I have no idea what her realtionship with Hamln was before the whole tape imprisonment and abandonment inside of the cartoon. But one thing is sure, Rebecca most likely trusted her father Sam, and his disappearance might have caused feelings of Grief over that. And maybe that's when Hamln took a more hands on approach towards Rebecca/Amanda and their whole ritual.

In one of the secret tapes in Amanda 1, we see a news Anchor, correct me if I'm wrong, talking about Sam's  disappearance and talking about it like 'Sam abandonning.' the studio, or the cartoon production itself. We obviously know he was kidnapped in ATA2 now, we know it's not him abandonning his daughter. Amanda may or may not know about his good intention since she mentions in the 'Do you feel Safe?"" tape that he was too trusting. This may imply she knows about her father's disappearance and the real causes of it in ATA2. But in ATA1, all mentions of her father either set her off, confuse her. What's strange in ATA2 is that she wished she had 'One of those' in the very first tape when she asks who we would want to see. So either she still thinks Sam abandonned her, or we make her find out the truth by seeking the secret tape when he was very clearly kidnapped.  Now Mr. Colton is obviously a good father, caring about how his child feels, worrying about her being upset and even vehemently refusing to lie to his daughter when he knows that Hamln aren't good people despite him being in a situation where he could die. In the ""Coffee Break with Sadie"" tape in ATA1 we see him very happily talking about his daughter, saying she's the light of his life, that meeting his daughter brought him a huge source of joy. We can see that during the kidnapping Tape in ATA2, he very much means those words. It shows that Sam Colton was a very genuine, very caring person, someone that brought joy into Rebecca's life as well after she was adopted. Let's bring up her adoption for a bit there. Her status as a former oprhan child can indicate lingering feelings of abandonment, granted she was old enough to understand that. But considering Sam mentioned adopting Rebecca on live television, I think it's safe to assume she is at least old enough to understand such concepts. What do you think she must have felt before Sam came into her life? That's right. **Abandonned.**  And for some people, when someone dies, it can feel like a certain sort of abandonment into their hearts. Blaming themselves with Abandon, thinking they could have done something to prevent it. I'm not a psychiatrist, far from it, but one can assume that when one person disappears, for one way or another, Abandonment is part of what the other person feels. Rebecca might have felt that way for years since her very young ages once she understood such feelings, and now feeling it again, with either Hamln abandonning her into these tapes, Sam disappearing without short notice, or something else entirely: Kate. Now Kate was someone that particularly wanted to try and contact Amanda. She was one of the few people that actually wanted to contact her, to know more about her. In ATA1 in the ""In your neighborhood."" episode, she mentioned Kate as her **Friend**, someone important enough to want to give her a gift, even being adamant about making it done NOW, as this was very important. Now obviously, Wooly had good intentions and tried to reassure Amanda that there was always another day. But what I think Wooly wasn't aware of, is that maybe, just maybe, Amanda was aware of Kate...terrible demise. Which is why she wanted to send the gift as soon as possible. In thr 'Everything rots' tape in game, she desperately wants you to answer if you believe everything rots, maybe implying that Kate's body might still be rotting somewhere, but still be there, as she mentioned in the same episode that she feels herself rotting but that it feels 'far away'.  Kate might be rotting 'far away' in the same way as Rebecca does. And in ATA2, in the 'Do you feel Safe?"" tape again, when you answer Kate, she said she 'used' to trust her a lot too. 'Used to.' This could imply she doesn't anymore because she's gone and Riley took her place and she doesn't know Kate is dead, OR, she know Kate is dead and that's why she said that because, say it with me kids, she feels **Abandonned** due to Kate's death. Which pertains to us finding the cassette tape where Kate's death happens. A quick segway I also want to bring up is the Possum, very possibly being Jordan. He behaves erratically in a way that he doesn't listen to anything or anyone. Except to Joanna, his big sister. As soon as the Talkie Walkie show up in the, again, 'Do you feel safe?' tape, it's as if he's desperately wants to reach for Joanna because either he wants to be with her and doesn't want to feel 'abandonned' again. Of course, not everything has to pertain to abandonnment, but it's a small detail I wanted to bring up. Which leads us too...

**Part 2: Anger:**

Obviously, we see a lot of anger in this series. Either from Amanda, Wooly,  maybe from the Possum/Jodan, and Joanna (towards herself which is more resentment.) and possibly more I probably forgot.  
Amanda/Rebecca could be angry for MANY reasons: Being stuck in the tapes, the possible rituals that was done on herself, losing her father, Wooly brushing off her feelings as if it was invalid or didn't matter as long as everything looks fine, the ""Meatman"" traumatizing her, Hamln (although this feels more like fear couple with Anger.). Which is why it's difficult to pinpoint the true reason, the core of her anger. There could also posssibly be anger towards Riley because whenever they don't do what she says, because she feels deep in her heart that she needs it especially in 2.  The frustration she feels every time a wrong answer is chosen. Every time her father is brought up, of Hamln and the Meatman is brought up. So many things that Riley could do that sets her off. In the ""Do you feel Safe?"" tape, there's answers that indicate she trusts Riley, that she doesn't trust them anymore, or that she doesn't trust her quite yet. Trust is a VERY important thing in grieving. Trust to give yourself time to grieve, trust to not blame you. Trust that the person who died doesn't hate you. Trust that out there, somewhere, they find Solace. The grieving that Amanda possibly feels, for herself. For Rebecca. She could test Riley's trust in the 'Let's Plan a Trip!' tape in ATA2 by saying 'Do you really think you could do that?' when we say we either want to go see her, or Rebecca, since they ARE the same person after all. Does Riley REALLY think she could find Amanda/Rebecca after so many attempts Kate did, for YEARS AND YEARS ON END? The sheer task of finding her seems almost impossible. So much she mentions all the places 'she could have gone' in that very same tape. That is a huge telling sign that she is still in the process of grieving. Rebecca I mean. The very nothing of trust sets her off to no end. In the 'We can fix this.' tape in ATA2, her distaste towards the Meatman can be explaned. He could have been a surgeon trying to reassure Rebecca as she gets in whatever one the secret tapes showed us in that very game, showing her in a bed. 'You may feel this pinch' especially. She is SO angry when you mention the Meatman when you say you trust him, or straight up ends the tape, in the ""Do you feel Safe?' tape in ATA2. The anger represented by the monster and her distrust for Riley. If the monster is pacified by the Wooly plushie, it doesn't do anything to them. But if it isn't, then it kills them. 'When you feel bad.' especially shows this. The monster calms down when Amanda tells it to. It is a telltale sign that Amanda is starting to trust Riley and why she might believe them in 'Do you Feel Safe?' if you say you trust her. Her trust has also been broken by Wooly a long time ago. We don't know what happened. But what I think is happening, is that Wooly, every time she gets Angry at him, it makes him sad. He gets so incredibly hopeless and tries to fix everything in 'his way', and gets angry whenever Riley doesn't go his way either. This might be just a side effect of being sealed in those tapes: Sheer Anger at whoever doesn't play by the rules of either character...You can choose to trust Wooly, or you can choose to trust Amanda. Which results in the Anger of both, as told in the true ending. This was possibly Wooly's anger lunging at Joanna because Riley didn't trust him. Now, what I'm about to say can cause a lot of controversy here but: None of Wooly NOR Amanda are the antagonists here. They are victims. Victims obligated to make someone trust them or they get angry because you choose one way of dealing with Hamln, or the other. At least that's what I think. Wooly's dismissive behavior towards Amanda's feelings may feel like a lingering thing of the thing that happened between them way before, but he still feels really really guilty. And in 'We can Fix it', in ATA2, we can see her being surrounded by Woolys and crying. Then there's the smiling Wooly looming over the Amandas in the tape which can depict Wooly's obliviousness that he's doing something wrong because of his toxic positivity. Amanda at this point, desperately needs to bring up negative things, like death, rotting, loneliness. Because all of these are what Rebecca feels in this limbo of cartoonish nightmare, and Wooly might not be aware of it. Maybe he is, but he tries to do it with his own ways. There is such a thing as 'good intentions, but horrible ways to go about it'. This is Wooly's case, at least I feel like it. Amanda is more genuine with her emotions because she's the one concerned about it so she lets her rage out every chance she gets. That's how she deals with grief. Wooly on the other hand, dismisses everything, doesn't want to talk about death or rotting, wants a happy ending which is why he wants you to go his way with the story in 'When you're feeling bad.' Which is why she physically takes it out on him in some tapes like in 'Oh no, Accidents!' in ATA1. People say he might be a bad influence for Amanda's grief in that case. But the ""Let's find some treasure' tape, she asks for something that would make her feel better after she didn't find a valuable treasure. She dismisses the plastic Mr. Rooster her father most likely gave her and would have emotional value to her. And yet, she calms down a bit and leaves you alone once you give her the Wooly plush. I wonder what that could possibly mean?

One way I thought about, is that: Amanda wants to trust Wooly again. Which is why she didn't kill him in ATA1 in the last tape when she was about to. She also was happy to give Wooly a birthday gift when it was his birthday in the second 'In your neighborhood' tape. This could point out that, after Kate died, Wooly was someone she could trust before. In ATA2 you don't see him until later. She is really ANGRY at him because she was in the grieving stage of their friendship, this is case, the Anger stage of Grieving.  Grieving comes back a lot in my analysis and I hope that it's not just me. In the 'Do You Feel Safe?' tape, she sounds like she accepted what happened between them. And that makes Wooly feel really, really bad. Not saying Amanda isn't valid here, she very much is. Just that both of them have very different ways of grieving. When you mention horror in 'When you feel bad' tape, Wooly gets flashbacks of him screaming in pain, meat (a wink to the Meatman that he also probably hurt Wooly at some point.) and he is looks very traumatized, but again, he tries to move on and tell the story. One is dismissing everything and making as if everything is alright, turning away at any sign of death and grief and sadness, and the other...

**Part 3: Acceptance:**

Coming to terms, and acceptance, is very important in grief. We see that in Amanda from the first game, albeit not as strongly as in the second game for sure. We see Amanda accepting that she is still out there, somewhere in the very last tape. We see her accepting that it was Wooly's birthday and that something bad happened. Wooly deters this by saying it was his birthday. Accepting Wooly as her friend once we write Wooly in the second 'In your neighborhood!' tape.  She 'accepts' Riley's help even though it's really hard for her after feeling abandonned and betrayed so many times ever since she was put for adoption, the very first betrayal of her life if you think about it. And the way we see Wooly being sad that Kate was the friend she wants to send cookies to in the first Neighborhood tape, it's because in some part of him, he maybe wants Amanda to accept Kate's death too. There is A LOT of speculating in these two games, but every single one, at least to me, pertains to grief.  Riley also has to accept doing horrible things like cutting the doll's throat, breaking Blabbot in order to get the key. These are minor things and this is probably a stretch, but I really want this to be consistent as Acceptance to me is a very important part of both games. Amanda also warned Riley of the 'big secret' which could have huge consequences, being so far into the game that something is horribly wrong and then the TV goes ballsitic. Riley breaks the TV and Joanna shows up in the true ending. Riley accepted the consequences and the events that Kate set in motion (which she felt horrible after, yet another stage of grief, depression.).

In ATA2, we see that Amanda mentioned all the places she could have gone to, accepting she can't anymore. She accepts help from Riley yet again and stops the monster from hurting them. She stops her own monster yet again. And she accepted that what she needed was Riley finally acknowledging the death. The loneliness that she felt by telling the sad story. Wooly felt dejected because I feel like he didn't get to cheer Amanda up in his own way, maybe also accepting the fact that he can't do anything for his bond with Amanda and why his monster manifested in Anger due to that in the true ending of ATA2. And Amanda accepted the Wooly plushie, someone she tried to deny, she tried to run away from, finally deciding to let go of the pain, and heartache, of whatever betrayal she felt (and that Wooly desperately tried to fix which in turn have his own grief over and gave up in the story tape.).  
And now, what will come of the acceptance? A new beginning? A happy ending? A bittersweet ending that will show us that live moves on after grieving? Only time will tell if we get an ATA3 which will most likely, wrap everything up.

In conclusion: thank you for reading my nonsensical blabbling about a series that is very, very dear to my heart. And to all of us who are suffering, me including, I wish us, a very happy and thorough recovery. See you in another realm !",2,1730590435.0,amandatheadventurer,0,1.0,False

1gi9h2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gi9h2j/i_feel_so_alone/,I feel so alone. ,"I (17m) genuinely feel so disconnected to everyone. For context, I’ve always been pretty much on my own. I had one friend though, who I was really tight with, one I would do EVERYTHING with. That typical childhood friend. He unfortunately passed away when I was 10. Even then, I didn’t really have anyone else. If he was busy, or anything, I’d sit alone in my room - probably gaming. 

I like my dad, but I rarely get to see him much. He switched jobs when I was 10-11. A profession which he works away at. Coming home on the weekends every fortnight. At periods being away several months. 

I try to bond with my mom, which is difficult. She became so weird when I was 4. Her mom, my grandma, died at 66 to cancer, which resulted in my mom basically becoming and alcoholic and a heavy smoker. Which she tries to hide, not very well though. I sometimes find her drinking wine hidden in a water bottle, or in a coffee cup. I find it odd how used I am to this, that I barely bat an eye to it. She still thinks that me and my little brother doesn’t know anything, and just lives on with her stuff. Don’t get me wrong. She’s not a “bad” mom at all. I get what I need. Clothes, phones, books - you name it - like it’s nothing. She puts a warm meal on the table 2 times a day, 7 times a week, working hard, almost throwing money at me. But I’ve no connection to her whatsoever, emotionally. 

I’ve never had a problem being on my own. I’ve tried to find friends. I try to socialize. I try to be fun. But it seems like no one really wants anything to do with me. I guess I’m just that guy who’s not fun to be with. Showing no interest in whatsoever. And that’s fine! People have their preferences in others, of course I’m not going to force anyone to be with. I thought, when I was younger, someday is my day. Someday, maybe someone will like me. That day came. I found my (ex) girlfriend. 

It was so great. For the first time in my ENTRIE life, I had someone who listen to me talk about anything. No matter what she’d pay interest in what I had to say. I wasn’t judged by anything. Not my looks, where I’m just objectively ugly, and I’ve had to hear that quite a few times lol. Not my opinions, ideas, hobbies - literally anything. I felt so free, heard, seen and loved. It lasted for 1.5 years before it sadly ended due to some bs circumstances. We parted as very good friends, although deciding to cut contact (for reason I can’t bother list). 

Then, the realization hit. Im fucking alone. Again. This has never been a big problem before, because that was just the way things were. With the slight hope that it one day might change. But after experiencing being something for someone. Actually matter to someone, it feels so dang empty afterwards. I’m a stoic, and poetic, fanatic, but I even struggle to apply my philosophy to myself for the past 2 months. I gaslight myself during the days into thinking Im fine, that loneliness, and living for myself is enough. Then 11pm hits, and I realize it truly isn’t, and why humans are social animals living in societies. I really don’t know what to do anymore. And everyday, post 11pm (ish) I just wish life was no more. The days are aight, as I can distract myself enough into thinking I’m normal, like everyone else. Either through spending me time by gaming and reading, or putting on a smile around classmates. 

But at the end of the day, going to bed with the only notifications I’ve gotten through the day being news articles, it’s pretty fucking sad ngl. I wish just someone would care enough to ask how I was. Being excited to talking to me. Especially going to zero, after experiencing my phone never stopping to light up from that one person. 

Like now I can’t sleep unless I have a fucking asmr:tist yapping so much in my ears about me and life being ight, that the other thoughts just goes to rest, letting me sleep peacefully. 

It’ll be alright though, I think. Amor Fati, and let’s take every day for what it is.

Been going through a rocky patch in the relationship. I've tried to get him to therapy but he refuses. And a few weeks back he said jokingly that he will work on the relationship if I give him a “hall pass"" while he's on his trip with friends. Didn’t think much about it then. I had access to his Instagram.
He changed his password a week before the trip and didn't give me the password and I didn't ask for it. But this felt weird and I correctly guessed the password and logged in on the first day of his trip.
Saw message notification from an unknown person and opened it and figured she was the waitress at a bar he visited. He has followed her on Instagram and given her compliments and asked if she wanted to meet for coffee. And the next day he invited her to the hotel he was staying at and invited her for a coffee again. She declined saying she has a boyfriend. He deleted the chats immediately but I had seen the whole thing unfold. I felt deeply hurt and I couldn't function. I've been loyal to this person and to this relationship and I can't imagine myself doing something like this. Today I woke up and I'm wondering if I'm overthinking or overreacting.

It's so so awesome and I'll be pinning it on my wall! To be honest, I grew up playing the spin-off games, such as Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, instead of the main series. I never learned how to play the card game either. My first actual game was Pokemon Scarlet, and I haven't even finished it. But I grew watching the anime and so the franchise is special to me! I even have characters based off of the canon pokemon :). I'm biased, but I'll always recommend the series to anyone and everyone haha

Thank you u/CharmingCorpses for the coffee postcard! That's crazy, I didn't expect the shop to be *that* local! Do you have any favorites there? I'll definitely have to take a look haha. Anyways, thanks for telling me about your kitty - I love hearing about people's pets. She sounds precious! Small cats are adorable.

Thank you u/pricklypots for the Halloween postcard! I haven't watched or heard of Rosemary's Baby, so I did some reading on it. Occults are no stranger to horror movies, but the theme still reminds me of Hereditary. Since watching it, I've mostly stopped watching horror haha. I think themes of cults and possessions spook me because I was raised in a religious environment. Is there anything that scares you?

Thank you u/TCcowgirl for the pretty bird card! A voice acting class sounds amazing! I've never thought of it before. I'm happy to hear that you've been enjoying it, though! Everyone in my high school was required to take an arts class before graduating. I took a couple of classes but also joined their theatre club - it was super interesting learning how technical it all is. Unfortunately I haven't done anything of the sort since starting college, but I've been seeing my university's musicals each year and get blown away every time. I love acting - I hope your class is able to help you with your broadcasting! Multiple speakers and a fight scene... how fun!

Thank you u/bananas3706 for the postcard of Restaurant Pelikan! I've never been out of the country, but I'd love to visit Scandinavia! I'm not sure what my dream visit would be. I like taking photos, so anywhere cool would be awesome to visit (how specific)! Although, I'd also like to visit Japan for the museums, stores, and stationery. And Vietnam for the coffee shops and food! You mentioned really enjoying a meal you had in 2010 - do you remember what it was? Also, that's really cool that you were able to visit whatever you saw on *No Reservations*! I get excited even visiting something I see on social media lol.

Thank you u/zuhms for the cute cute pumpkin card! Are you kidding me? Anyways, I totally get not liking the texture of avocado. And it tastes like grass - as someone who *does* like it! I actually didn't try avocado as a savory food until a couple years ago! I had grown up eating it with condensed milk or as a smoothie. Anyways, something I wish I liked was sushi! I looks great, but I can't get over the texture of raw fish. Or the ingredients being cold. Do you like sushi?

Thank you u/TyeDyeAmish for the postcard from Ohio! That's a pretty picture - I'm sure it'd be even more stunning in person! I've never been to Ohio, is there anything to do? I've been to Iowa, which is full of grass and trees. Is Ohio the same? I only wonder because they're two states apart.

Thank you u/mysteryvus for the postcard of Matsumoto's Shaved Ice! No matter the weather, I'll always crave shaved ice, gelato, and ice cream! The Ichiban Special sounds *so* good. The mochi reminds me of a bingsu I get from a local place of my own. Anyways, how often do you get to go?

Thank you u/sassyliltart for the Strange Planet postcard! I didn't think the artist would have postcards, but it makes sense if there are already books. I remember reading their series on Tumblr and through Pinterest reposts as a highschooler - it's amazing how far the comic has come! Anyways, I've been craving boba myself. I usually crave pasta too, but I dragged my girlfriend to Olive Garden two times last month and I think we've had our fill lmao (I'll always be willing to trade in anything for that gnocchi soup, though). right now, I'm currently wanting Korean barbecue... especially that cheese corn!

Thank you u/faruyu for the rambutan postcard! Rambutan growing on a tree looks a lot more beautiful than in a basket. The card is very pretty! I forget this fruit exists, haha - I haven't had it in a while! I don't have much an opinion on it. I think persimmon is my favorite exotic fruit. Do you have a favorite as well?

Thank you u/nyancatNOVA for the bird postcard! I love the troubled bird series - I think the first time I saw one was on Tumblr when I was a middle schooler. Wow. Anyways, thanks for sending a card despite being busy! I had wanted to send cards for World PC Day as well but didn't have the time to design any :(. Here's hoping for more time next year!

Thank you u/t3ctim for the Lego postcard! Do you have any sets/builds you want? Some of the ones I want are the Milky Way Galaxy, the Great Wave, bonsai, and Auspicious Dragon. Two of my friends gifted me and my girlfriend the bouquet build, and a couple Lunar New Year's ago I bought the money tree! Otherwise, I don't have any other sets. Do you?

Thank you u/Powerful_Cobbler_215 for the Pooh-bear and Tigger card! Super cute! Do you have a favorite character?

Thank you u/Commercial-Loan5249 for the photograph! Raspberry chocolate chip pancakes sound *so* amazing - I thought pancakes and waffles peaked at white or peanut butter chips and never thought of this combination. I guess I'm going to have to find a way to teleport to Vermont now. 

Thank you u/KoreWrites for the dinosaur postcard! Honestly, I've never been to Disney World but I'd love to go! The rides sound so exciting - do you have a favorite area or attraction? I'd love to explore Animal Kingdom especially.

Thank you u/duttonmelia for the dog postcard! I don't have any pets as of this moment but I hope that once I'm able to get my own place, I can adopt some pups! I'm actually working towards establishing a couple nano tanks for some freshwater shrimp right now. I'd love to have other non-traditional/exotic pets in the future as well! 

Thank you u/t3ctim for the postcard from Hong Kong! The design is super cool! ""Dim Sum is the best""... I agree to a point as well, I love Chinese food haha. Do you have any favorite dim sum dishes? I love love love the shrimp dumplings, barbecue pork buns, and this pork pastry that my local dim sum place serves. My dad treats me to their takeout every month or so and it's my most favorite thing he does lol.

Thank you u/cassopeia88 for the card! An alpaca farm - how cute! I've heard that they're a lot nicer than llamas, is that true?

Thank you u/nonoyo_91 for the birthday card! Don't worry about it being belated, this was such a lovely surprise! You didn't have to send me anything at all. Please don't feel bad (I'll feel bad too, eek). I appreciate all the extra goodies that you included! I adore the recipe cards especially; even though I don't usually cook, I have a few recipes I've kept over a couple years and hopefully forever more! Thanks again, friend - I hope you're doing better.

Thank you u/Iambaby1989 for the Hello Kitty and friends card! So cute! You sent me a Pompom sticker that I find super funny because he doesn't have his pudding cap (he's bald!!!)!

Thank you u/zureski for the kitty postcard! Thankfully, it *has* gotten cooler where I'm at. It unfortunately took a while though. Everybody in Arizona jokes about the locals switching to sweaters once the temperature hits the 70s lol. Anyways, it actually does get cold enough for hot drinks! I think I'd fall into seasonal depression if I couldn't have hot cocoa on the daily haha. Whenever the weather gets warmer, I remember how it was once cold enough for campfires to huddle around and get bitter. I hate the heat :/

Thank you u/slobber_bones for the BTS postcard! I absolutely love this it's so cute. Admittedly, I'm not all too familiar with BTS either, but like you I think their characters are adorable. The mascots dressed in tiger costumes was something I could not pass up on

Thank you u/eccentric_bee for the hand-painted card! The quality looks so crisp oh my god. Anyways, 70s in October sounds amazing! I'm jealous - for Arizona, the first three weeks were practically still in the 90s (with occasional 80s when the weather wanted to get our hopes up). Thankfully, it's cooler now! I love cold weather because I really enjoy bundling up in blankets and lazing around. My seasonal depression hits in the summer instead lmaooo",5,1730590017.0,RandomActsofCards,16,0.86,False

Hey fellow wanderlust warriors! It's Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and I'm about to take you on a journey into the wild world of solo travel. Strap in, because this ride is going to be anything but ordinary!

**Why Fly Solo?**

Picture this: You wake up to the soothing sounds of nature on the banks of the Tennessee River. Now imagine you’re not with your regular travel crew but embarking on this serene adventure solo. Yes, that's right, just you, yourself, and, um, you! The thought of solo travel might sound daunting, but trust me, it's a game-changer. 🙌

**A Slice of Solitude & Growth**

When I first ventured out solo, I faced the classic dilemma of speaking to myself too much (yep, those light bulb moments are real!). There's something liberating about relying on your judgment for every decision, from where to eat (bring on the taste bud dance) to which trails to hike (pro tip: pack snacks!). Through these experiences, I rediscovered Derek! I embraced my likes, confronted my fears, and, humorously, perfected the art of taking selfies without half my face cut off. 📸

**Challenging? Yes. Rewarding? Absolutely!**

One challenge? No one holds your camera for those perfect riverside photos. Solution: Befriend fellow travelers or invest in a decent tripod. 🤓 But beyond that, imagine savoring a meal without being hurried or hiking at your pace with nature’s playlist on full blast. Solo travel taught me that my own company was not only sufficient; it was awesome! 💃

**Perspective Shift**

Going solo broke down walls for me. I wasn’t just visiting a place; I became a part of it. Chatting with locals became second nature, and each encounter taught me something new. Plus, there's nothing like watching fog roll over a lush riverbank with a warm cup of coffee in hand, realizing life is too short to pause your passions.

**Tips for the Solo Traveler**

1. **Research & Plan**: Spontaneity is thrilling, but a bit of planning ensures you cover the must-see spots while leaving room for happy accidents.

2. **Stay Open-Minded**: Embrace the unexpected, be it a sudden rain shower or making friends with locals while waiting it out.

3. **Pack Light, but Smart**: Bring essentials. Also, pro-tip: always keep a travel journal. Those random thoughts and experiences are gold later!

4. **Safety Comes First**: Share your itinerary with family or a trusted friend. And always trust your gut instincts.

5. **Embrace the Awkward and Have Fun**: Dance like nobody's watching (because they’re not!), laugh at your mishaps, and live in the moment.

In the end, solo travel isn't just about where you go but how you grow. Whether you're lounging by a Chattanooga riverfront or exploring a bustling city, the journey's true reward is the new you who returns. Now, go pack those bags and make memories that last a lifetime! 🌟

Feel free to drop any questions or share your own experiences below. Let's conquer this travel world, one solo trip at a time!

1gi96ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gi96ax/sf_how_mindreading_devices_almost_ruined_my/,[SF] How mind-reading devices almost ruined my company,"The day I realized mind-reading devices were real, I almost felt like shutting down the whole operation. We’d known for years that companies in certain circles were dabbling with the tech, but everyone had the same reservations. It was expensive, technically illegal, and morally… well, in another universe entirely. But somehow, my competitors seemed to be pulling every move before I’d even thought of it. Deals were slipping through our fingers, negotiations that should have been simple were turning on me, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that every big client we sat down with had already mapped out my mind.

The pressure was eating at me. I had our people scouring contracts for leaks, plugging any possible intel gaps, tightening up privacy protocols—and still, I’d walk into meetings feeling like they knew every detail we’d discussed in prep. I suspected they were using mind-reading devices, but I had no way to prove it. Not without accusing them outright and torching any trust we still had. I was stuck, and if things didn’t change, we were going to be bled dry.

Around that time, Billy started coming by the office for odd jobs. Billy and I went way back, and while he’d never really climbed the career ladder, he’d built himself a solid gig in HVAC repair. He didn’t have much in the way of stability, so every now and then, I’d throw him a call whenever something broke in our building. It was a nice way to give him some extra cash, and as VP, I could easily approve a few hundred bucks here and there without anyone batting an eye.

One day in August, our air conditioning decided to pack it in during the hottest week of the year. The office was sweltering, so I called up Billy in a panic, begging him to fix it before we melted. He came by within the hour, wearing his usual baseball cap and cracking jokes, and I felt the tension melt away the second he walked in. Billy could make a boiler room feel relaxed.

He finished up just before a major meeting with a client that I knew was using one of those mind-reading devices. I’d spent the whole morning prepping my strategy, trying to keep my mind calm. When Billy finished, I told him to hang out for a while, help himself with some drinks and cool off in a near conference room. It was August, after all, and it didn’t seem fair to send him back into the heat. So he stuck around, making himself comfortable, while in the next room I felt the pressure starting to raise again. What if they are using mind reading? Is our company doomed?

But that meeting went… different. The client looked flustered, almost lost. They weren’t steering the conversation like usual. For once, I actually had control, and by the time we wrapped up, I’d closed the deal on terms I’d never thought they’d accept. It was a complete 180 from every meeting I’d had in the past few months, and I couldn’t put my finger on why.

A week or two later, I called Billy in for another repair—this time it was the thermostat, and I figured I’d let him stay cool in the office again afterward. I didn’t expect much, but sure enough, we had another meeting with a big client, and the exact same thing happened. This client, too, was suddenly fumbling, unable to anticipate my moves like they’d been doing all summer. It was uncanny.

By the third time Billy came in to fix a rattling vent, I started to suspect something. I’d noticed a pattern I couldn’t ignore: whenever Billy was around, our clients seemed thrown off, unable to use whatever edge they’d had on us. But I couldn’t connect the dots until I went on a late-night rabbit hole, scouring every article, forum, and whisper I could find about the mind-reading tech. That’s when I stumbled on a thread from an insider who hinted at an exploit no one wanted to talk about. Mind-reading devices, it turns out, relied on picking up clear, coherent frequencies. But certain mental patterns—like ADHD—could scramble the devices, creating noise that made them almost useless. The kind of mental noise you’d get if someone’s thoughts were always bouncing around, jumping from one idea to the next.

Billy, I realized, was a walking, breathing jammer. His mind was a whirlwind of scattered thoughts, a perfect counter to the tech my clients were leveraging against us. Just by sitting in the back of the room, he was blocking their ability to read me.

From that point on, I made it a habit to call him in every few weeks for “maintenance work.” I’d ask him to check the thermostat, give the AC a tune-up, or just come by for a coffee. I’d tell him to “stick around for a bit, cool off before you head out,” and he’d relax in the corner, happy to hang out while I tackled whatever high-stakes meeting I had that day. He never suspected a thing.

Billy became my secret weapon, though he never knew it. To him, it was just a little extra work and some free AC time, a few laughs over coffee in the break room. But to me? Billy was my firewall. My competitors never figured out why they’d lost their edge, and I didn’t have to fight tooth and nail just to keep us in business anymore.

One afternoon, after another flawlessly smooth meeting, I decided to bring Billy on as an official “consultant.” It was more of a creative title than anything, but it gave me an excuse to keep him in the office as much as possible. We set him up with a desk in the corner, an email account, and even a nameplate on his door that read, *Billy Travers, Special Projects Consultant.*

Billy thought it was hilarious when I asked him one day to come into the boardroom “just to keep me company.” I didn’t have the heart to explain the truth, and honestly, I didn’t think he’d believe me if I tried. To him, it was all just another day of getting paid to hang out and be himself. And for me? It was a rare, strange stroke of luck I’d gladly protect as long as I could.

I smoked cigarettes for about a year after high school.  One random day, I got so nauseous, I never wanted it again, and kicked the habit like that.

  
If it has any meaning to the discussion, I never got into hard drugs, gambling, etc.



I find when I quit caffeine, my sugar cravings go through the roof.

Seems I cannot quit both at the same time.  I have tried using one to quit the other.  i.e. ""allowing"" myself to indulge in sugar if it means no coffee.  I can do this for about 3-4 days.

Last month I was at the dentist three times: root canal, crown and 3 fillings.  So obviously that is not a long-term solution either.

1gi94yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1gi94yk/can_we_live_without_reddit_experiment_tools_and/,"Can we live without Reddit? (Experiment, Tools and Habits included)","I've been Digital Minimalist about 3 years, and I feel I'm very over 90% of the internet at this point, but not Reddit.

**I've arranged my phone/browser ecosphere to block**

-Feeds (News Feed Eradicator/logging out of everything on my phone)

-I've blocked most everything that I deemed anti-social or addictive (porn, Twitch, argumentative news websites) using 1Focus on my Macbook and Black Spaces on my phone (but this isn't perfect, more later).

-I use Unhooked Youtube extension in my browser + UBlock Origin (have for years now) and my Youtube viewing habits are incredibly narrow (I haven't seen a Youtube ad in YEARS so seeing one on my phone is enough to turn me off using Youtube on my phone + I don't see discoverable tabs, I purposefully unsubscribe from shit I deem pointless, I've broken that Youtube habit)

-I've never used Instagram, Tiktok, etc. so that was an easy cut out however I did use FB specifically for the messenger so I just went and used News Feed Eradicator + 1Focus blocked Stories, Groups, Marketplace, whatever might get me clicking, so I can ONLY use the Messenger and I don't install anything on my phone + my FB password is some insane string so to access FB in my phone browser I'd need to reset it and go through hoops so no worry there.

**So what do I replace these habits with?**

-The biggest one is reading. I read any chance I get. I have a Kindle and buy the occasional hardcover. I read anything and everything (I won't lie, I use Z-Lib and just download whatever looks interesting). 

-I read horror, romance, magical fantasy, if I don't like it I stop reading it, I've finished 61 books this year, some were 100 pages some were 900 pages. 

-I buy self-help books as I think having them on the shelf keeps me motivated but I read Cal Newport and Ryan Holiday and whatever my Goodreads recommends me.

-Past that I go for walks, I got really into brewing coffee and got good at that, I make tea in the evening and read with my wife, I get cinema hobbies and delve in like I watched the David Lynch filmography + analysis (video essays, Slavoj Zizek essays, watch interviews so every Lynch movie was 8 hours or so of effort akin to Cal Newsport's ""Live a Deep Life"" mantra), I'm currently learning to make bread on the weekends. I'm always looking for new hobbies

Which takes us to Reddit. I struggle with Reddit because it's actually useful. I can actually go to arrslash[insertmynicehobby] and get useful advice on how to fix a broke [insert hobby thing].

But there are bad parts of course.

I've blocked a massive list of subreddits such as arrslashpublicfreakout, NSFW stuff, using 1Focus and I just don't log in on my phone but I do find myself breaking that phone rule such as when I'm stranded at an airport on a layover or getting a foot massage or whatever.

So now I want to block Reddit out completely for 5 days and see how it goes.

**Problems I anticipate**

-I use Reddit for a LOT of little fixes (why is my espresso machine making this noise? Is this turn table worth the money?)

-I am in a specialized career field (International Education) and Reddit is a great place for insight, job reviews, in-class tips and such

-I am sadly all wrapped up in the election and Doomsdaying the future so I do, sadly, scroll through the bad engagement political subs from time to time (they aren't even bad but I know it's not helping me)

-I have found myself getting into side arguments with u/ButtFart69 which opens the feedback loop of checking what his lame comeback might be, never a good habit to get into

This isn't a daily think but I have other things to focus on.

So my hope is I can get all of the above from just Googling and reading articles, watching videos (I am worried of both of these as Reddit is just dudes posting while the above is ad driven corporate slop a lot of times), and seeing what else might be out there OR just doing without.

So I am going to research the best HARD BLOCK app I can find (which is a problem as I use a VPN on my phone 24/7 and most of these don't work with those) and I'm going to 1Focus block all of Reddit for 5 days on my Macbook in about 12 hours from posting this.

","This summer I met a girl, and I thought she was pretty so I spoke to her and we hit it off. Then, I had more dates where we’d go to coffee shops and talk for hours. I think it was pretty obvious I was into her, but I didn’t say anything because I was just nervous. Anyways, I really liked and felt bad that I didn’t kiss her. Anyways, we both camps and I would be away for a week, and at that time it felt like an eternity, so I messaged that I liked her. Fortunately, she liked me back, and I was elated. This was the first I genuinely liked. Throughout this time period and especially after this, she took ages to respond. I think at one point, it was around 3 days and one of my mates just told me to block her, or that she wanted to play games. She didn’t really seem like that sort of person to me, ironically she’s somebody that values honesty. The message I’d asked is if she was free because I wanted to see her. She said she wasn’t, and I remember being pissed off, not because she wasn’t free but because she has snap maps and I know she saw it, but she just chose to ignore the message and leave me hanging. 

Anyways, she was free later but it was only for 2-3 hours, and not a full day. Also, this was fairly rushed, so I couldn’t ‘plan’ a date. So, we just walked, I probably should have held her hand or done something, I was just nervous. Not nervous in terms of speaking, but in terms of intimacy. We chatted and then she had to go, and I felt unfulfilled. Then it was raining, and we were both under my coat and then she sort of hugged into me, I could tell she was slightly nervous too. Afterwards, we parted and he gave her a book, pachinko, because it’s my favourite book and her teacher recommend it to her. I still had this feeling that I hadn’t ‘got with’ or that I was falling behind, in that regard, I felt bad because I guess I felt it’s the masculine thing to do. Then, we do things that still show interest in each other, I did silly things like make playlists, and she would send relationship reels to me. I know this seems trivial, it really did mean a lot to me because at least there was hope, in the sense I hadn’t ’fumbled.’ So school starts, and it’s pretty busy given we’re both in our last year. I ask to see her, because I want to bridge the gap and spend time with her, but she was genuinely ill, and she says once she gets better then we can, this was pretty obvious. Then once she got better, I asked but she said was busy with rehearsals. She goes to a day school and I very much doubt she had rehearsals all weekend, but I took it. I suppose she forgot about this, because on the weekend she sent me a picture of getting ready for a party. I don’t care that she went for a party, which with her girlfriends, but care that she was hardly communicative and was also probably lying. Then I asked again. She least me on delivered for 3 days, even though I had already double texted. 

My friend gave me some advice to ‘confront’ her, and ask what our relationship was. So I said, ‘where are we going with this.’ She then sends a fairly long message apologising and pretty much said : she was waiting for her workload to die down and it just wasn’t, she didn’t think she could have an equal relationship. My heart truly sank, as I truly and genuinely adored this girl. To some degree, I was also angry and felt like I had been played like a fiddle. So I sent a voice message, saying that I also had a lot of work and that I still made time for her. She responded with an even longer voice message stating that she got it and this it’s not you it’s me, she wasn’t ready for the equal relationship that I wanted. She said she was sorry and she ‘liked’ me, but she did not sound genuine. In my voice you could hear that I cared. It sounded like she did not give a fuck. She said this wasn’t concrete and we could try ‘in summer’ when we’re less busy. I said fine as long as she knows my intentions.  She said she didn’t want to fuck it up by rushing, which I thought was somewhat fair enough. Then it was pretty awkward, despite her already getting a uni offer, which was great news. I said I couldn’t do it and we should just  take a break- ‘no contact.’ This pretty much ate me up in inside, and the irony is I only lasted 4 days, which is how long she regularly left me on delivered. I responded with an apology saying I had been impulsive, she appreciated the honesty.

Then she was at some camp and left me on delivered for a week, and responded the day before my birthday. I was pretty pissed off, given that she had regular access to her phone where snap score was rising and then decided to message me. I didn’t want to give her the easy route of saying happy birthday on my birthday, mainly because that would mean I would have to respond after 2 hours to her week long response. I left her on delivered and responded after 4 days, and this is where we’re at now. She hasn’t responded and I’m waiting.

What do I even do? Not even saying happy birthday is so disrespectful, and I’m not going to beg for it. Yet, at the same time, even though I’ve got with girls since, I don’t like them, and can only think of her. I like her so much but hardly ever get the chance to show or tell her. I feel like the relationship is really on its last legs and I want to salvage it. ",1,1730588957.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

1gi8vq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gi8vq8/finding_community_outside_the_church/,Finding community outside the church,"Hello!

For the obligatory brief background: I left the church a couple years ago. I still live in Utah while I’m finishing my bachelor’s degree, in fact I live with my very devout parents at the moment because rent is insane here and they are very kind despite my ""waywardness."" That’s a whole other topic though.

I wanted to ask those who still live surrounded by Mormon culture, be that in Utah or similar places, how do you go about making friends and meeting people?

Growing up I met all my friends and did all dating through the church. When I started college I noticed that making connections with people was harder than I expected, and that was when I was still an active member and had all the opportunities for socializing that the church hosts. I was even at BYU at the time (I got out of there as fast as I could when I decided to leave the church thankfully).

Now that I’m completely out of the church, I’ve become extremely lonely. I sometimes didn’t even like church activities because I can be a bit of an introvert, but now I have the complete opposite problem of almost never having anything social to go to. Obviously, this is at least partly my fault; I want to be clear that I very much disagree with any form of blackpill/incel and/or doomer ideology that would blame all my lonely feelings on other people.

Which brings me back to my question, how can I do better at socializing and potentially finding a community? As I mentioned, I’m in college, which I would think presents plenty of opportunities for meeting people, and yet they feel so rare. I try to chat with classmates and I do have a few close friends, I don’t want to give the misconception that I’m some sort of social pariah. Yet weekend after weekend go by and I have nowhere to be and no one to spend time with; I have lots of acquaintances and friends at school but never seem to get invited to anything. 

There has to be something that I'm missing, right? I often wonder if maybe everyone is so stressed out from school and busy with their own friendships and relationships, not to mention the state of the world, that they just don't have time to make new connections. That doesn't really make all that much sense though (?)

I go to college at UVU, and as far as I know there aren't any bars, social clubs, or even coffee shops where students go to hang out and meet new people. Isn't that really weird for a college town? Or am I just out of the loop and there are such places somewhere? I'm not even sure if I would enjoy meeting people like that, since I'm well aware that I'm a semi-introverted and often anxious person, but I would really like to at least try! 

I know for a fact that there are things that I could try still, like maybe looking into the clubs at my college or something like that, but I have no idea what will possibly work and have been feeling more and more discouraged about it lately. I would love to go on dates, but I don't get matches on dating apps, and honestly I'm having such a hard time making any sort of social connections whatsoever that finding a romantic one feels impossibly out of reach.

My post got longer than I intended, so I'll just summarize the question again here. Can anyone recommend activities, groups, or places that have helped them make new connections with people and feel a sense of community outside of the church?",7,1730588478.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

How do I proceed?","This summer I met a girl, and I thought she was pretty so I spoke to her and we hit it off. Then, I had more dates where we’d go to coffee shops and talk for hours. I think it was pretty obvious I was into her, but I didn’t say anything because I was just nervous. Anyways, I really liked and felt bad that I didn’t kiss her. Anyways, we both camps and I would be away for a week, and at that time it felt like an eternity, so I messaged that I liked her. Fortunately, she liked me back, and I was elated. This was the first I genuinely liked. Throughout this time period and especially after this, she took ages to respond. I think at one point, it was around 3 days and one of my mates just told me to block her, or that she wanted to play games. She didn’t really seem like that sort of person to me, ironically she’s somebody that values honesty. The message I’d asked is if she was free because I wanted to see her. She said she wasn’t, and I remember being pissed off, not because she wasn’t free but because she has snap maps and I know she saw it, but she just chose to ignore the message and leave me hanging. 

Anyways, she was free later but it was only for 2-3 hours, and not a full day. Also, this was fairly rushed, so I couldn’t ‘plan’ a date. So, we just walked, I probably should have held her hand or done something, I was just nervous. Not nervous in terms of speaking, but in terms of intimacy. We chatted and then she had to go, and I felt unfulfilled. Then it was raining, and we were both under my coat and then she sort of hugged into me, I could tell she was slightly nervous too. Afterwards, we parted and he gave her a book, pachinko, because it’s my favourite book and her teacher recommend it to her. I still had this feeling that I hadn’t ‘got with’ or that I was falling behind, in that regard, I felt bad because I guess I felt it’s the masculine thing to do. Then, we do things that still show interest in each other, I did silly things like make playlists, and she would send relationship reels to me. I know this seems trivial, it really did mean a lot to me because at least there was hope, in the sense I hadn’t ’fumbled.’ So school starts, and it’s pretty busy given we’re both in our last year. I ask to see her, because I want to bridge the gap and spend time with her, but she was genuinely ill, and she says once she gets better then we can, this was pretty obvious. Then once she got better, I asked but she said was busy with rehearsals. She goes to a day school and I very much doubt she had rehearsals all weekend, but I took it. I suppose she forgot about this, because on the weekend she sent me a picture of getting ready for a party. I don’t care that she went for a party, which with her girlfriends, but care that she was hardly communicative and was also probably lying. Then I asked again. She least me on delivered for 3 days, even though I had already double texted. 

My friend gave me some advice to ‘confront’ her, and ask what our relationship was. So I said, ‘where are we going with this.’ She then sends a fairly long message apologising and pretty much said : she was waiting for her workload to die down and it just wasn’t, she didn’t think she could have an equal relationship. My heart truly sank, as I truly and genuinely adored this girl. To some degree, I was also angry and felt like I had been played like a fiddle. So I sent a voice message, saying that I also had a lot of work and that I still made time for her. She responded with an even longer voice message stating that she got it and this it’s not you it’s me, she wasn’t ready for the equal relationship that I wanted. She said she was sorry and she ‘liked’ me, but she did not sound genuine. In my voice you could hear that I cared. It sounded like she did not give a fuck. She said this wasn’t concrete and we could try ‘in summer’ when we’re less busy. I said fine as long as she knows my intentions.  She said she didn’t want to fuck it up by rushing, which I thought was somewhat fair enough. Then it was pretty awkward, despite her already getting a uni offer, which was great news. I said I couldn’t do it and we should just  take a break- ‘no contact.’ This pretty much ate me up in inside, and the irony is I only lasted 4 days, which is how long she regularly left me on delivered.

1gi8tje,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gi8tje,Help! Flat paint in my flipped kitchen,"I would like some design help regarding my kitchen. My husband and I bought this house a little over 3 years ago and it was definitely a flip. Some of the components of the flip are better than others, but the tile work and paint are definitely not good. The cabinets and counters themselves are fine.

I have two areas in my kitchen that I am looking to add tile to, or figure out some other way to make a durable wall surface. The first area is to the left of my stove. In the first three pictures you're looking at the area next to my stove. The tile was ended pretty awkwardly under the window but honestly I don't know what I would have done either. However the paint in the house is almost all flat and as you can see grease splatters have gotten onto the wall and they can't be cleaned off. I would love to do something with that side of the wall to not only provide a cleanable surface but also maybe make that area where the tile ends under the window look less stupid. One tiny wrinkle: my exterior walls are plaster and the wall under the window is definitely not flat. 

In the fourth picture you'll see one of the sides of my kitchen that has just a set of uppers and lowers, and a pot rack on the left hand side. There's no backsplash there, and I really want to put one in there (coffee and mixer splatters oh my), but I know that design people would tell me to start and end where the cabinets do. I would however like a nice sturdy cleanable surface on that left hand side behind the pot rack, as pots ding into the wall and cause scratches and dents in the drywall. My brain was contemplating tile that would go all the way across and then up and down on both sides of the cabinets, but I think that would look too much like the inside of an old subway.

I would love any thoughts in regards to cleanable but sturdy surfaces that may not necessarily be tile. I'm not quite sure how I feel about a clear acrylic sheet; I have never seen it look good.

Hey everyone!

I’m trying to figure out the best way to arrange my new apartment, and I’d love some input. My current idea is to place my desk and entertainment center on one wall with the couch facing them. However, some people on Reddit have suggested flipping the layout—putting the couch along the opposite wall and the TV/entertainment center across from it.

Here’s my situation:

- Wall Space: The main wall I’d like to use for the couch is around 156 inches long. I’d like a large-ish couch that uses up most of this space, so I can stretch out and have enough seating for multiple people when friends come over.
- Entertainment Center Size: My entertainment center isn’t huge, and it fits best on the side with the desk. This way, I could have both in one area without things feeling cramped.
- Desk Setup: I work from home and need a dual monitor setup (one vertical, one horizontal), and my desk is about 5x2 feet. I’d prefer not to put the desk in my room since I’ll be spending a lot of time working there, and separating work from rest areas is important to me.

I’ve attached a blank template of my floor plan with measurements and would love any ideas, suggestions, or sketches for how to arrange everything (couch, coffee table, desk, entertainment center, etc.). I’m stuck between making sure it’s practical but also comfortable and spacious for hosting.
