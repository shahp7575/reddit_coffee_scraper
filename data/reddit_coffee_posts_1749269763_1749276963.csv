1l5dzii,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/1l5dzii/i_read_atomic_habits_and_lost_30_pounds/,I read Atomic Habits and lost 30 pounds,"I was a productivity porn addict.

Downloaded 47 habit tracking apps. Bought 12 different planners. Watched every YouTube video about ""morning routines of successful people."" Read every blog post about willpower and motivation.

Result? I was still the same lazy piece of shit who couldn't stick to anything for more than 5 days.

Then I read *Atomic Habits* by James Clear and realized I'd been doing everything backwards.

# Why You Keep Failing (It's Not What You Think)

You think the problem is motivation. Wrong.

You think the problem is discipline. Wrong.

You think the problem is you. Also wrong.

The problem is you're trying to change results instead of systems.

I spent 3 years trying to ""lose 30 pounds"" and ""read 50 books"" and ""wake up at 5 AM."" All outcome-focused bullshit.

James Clear flipped this: Don't focus on what you want to achieve. Focus on who you want to become.

Most people do this: *""I want to lose weight, so I'll go to the gym.""*

Smart people do this: *""I'm the type of person who takes care of their body. What would that person do right now?""*

The difference is identity. Because identity sticks long term. Tips and tricks don't.

When you see yourself as someone trying to lose weight, skipping the gym feels like failure.

When you see yourself as someone who prioritizes health, skipping the gym feels like betraying your identity.

I didn't start exercising to get in shape. I started exercising because that's what healthy people do. Small shift. Huge difference.

Here's the math that changed everything:

* 1% better every day = 37x better in a year
* 1% worse every day = nearly zero in a year

You don't need massive changes. You need tiny improvements that compound.

I didn't go from couch to marathon. I went from couch to walking around the block. Then two blocks. Then jogging one block.

Six months later, I was running 5km 2 times a week without thinking about it.

**Small changes aren't dramatic. But they're permanent.**

The 2-Minute Rule:

Every new habit should take less than 2 minutes to start.

* ""Exercise for an hour"" becomes ""Put on running shoes""
* ""Read 30 minutes"" becomes ""Read one page""
* ""Meditate for 20 minutes"" becomes ""Breathe deeply once""

This sounds stupidly simple because it is. But stupidly simple works.

You're not trying to achieve the habit. You're trying to prove to yourself that you're the type of person who does that habit.

Once putting on running shoes becomes automatic, adding the actual run is easy.

Environment design:

Your environment shapes your behavior more than your intentions.

I kept failing at reading because I'd leave my book in another room while keeping my phone next to my bed.

Then I flipped it:

* Phone charges in the kitchen
* Book sits on my nightstand
* Kindle app deleted from phone
* Physical books stacked where I can see them

Making good choices easier than bad choices is the closest thing to a cheat code for habits.

# How to stack habits:

Link new habits to existing ones: **""After \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].""**

My morning stack:

* After I start the coffee, I do 10 push-ups
* After I pour the coffee, I write 3 sentences
* After I drink the coffee, I read one page

Each habit triggers the next. It becomes a chain reaction that runs on autopilot.

Here's why most people quit right before they break through:

You work your ass off for weeks with zero visible results. This feels like failure. It's not.

Think of an ice cube at 31¬∞F. Heat it to 32¬∞F and suddenly it melts. The previous heat wasn't wasted - it was accumulating below the surface.

Most breakthroughs happen after months of work that seemed pointless.

I read consistently for 4 months before people started calling me ""well-read."" The reading wasn't working... until suddenly it was.

A simple system that worked for me:

1. **Start embarrassingly small** (2-minute rule)
2. **Focus on identity**, not outcomes
3. **Design your environment** to make good habits obvious
4. **Stack habits** onto existing routines
5. **Never miss twice** (consistency matters more than perfection)
6. **Track your progress** (what gets measured gets managed)

Most people want sexy, dramatic transformations. Clear offers the opposite - tiny, invisible improvements that compound into massive results.

The choice is yours:

* Keep chasing motivation and failing every few days
* Build systems that make success inevitable

I chose systems. Three years later, I'm unrecognizable from who I used to be.

Not because I had some massive breakthrough moment. Because I got 1% better, every single day, for 1,000+ days straight.

Start today. Start small. Start with identity.

So I‚Äôm a developer working on a new tool called Flexi that I hope helps to use to ecom businesses manage and run their businesses faster. I‚Äôm not here to pitch anything ‚Äî just hoping to learn from people actively running stores and dealing with the real day-to-day.

What I‚Äôm building:

Okay so basically it‚Äôs as if Google Sheets and Chat GPT had a baby - AI-powered spreadsheet-meets-database interface. It connects to your existing platforms (starting with Google Sheets, and now I‚Äôm working on Shopify), pulls in your product, order, and customer data, and gives you one flexible place to analyze it, clean it, enrich it, and even automate content creation.

Instead of building a dashboard or one-off reporting tools, I wanted to create something super flexible but powerful ‚Äî where you can manipulate your data freely, generate insights, write product descriptions, create new images, and build your own systems without code.

Why I‚Äôm building it:

Because of ecomm spreadsheet hell! I saw the same patterns over and over:

	‚Ä¢	Spreadsheets everywhere
	‚Ä¢	Repetitive content work
	‚Ä¢	Manual reporting
	‚Ä¢	Copy paste, copy paste 

I started Flexi to take the flexibility of Sheets and combine it with the kind of AI support and automation that saves time and makes growth easier ‚Äî especially for solo founders or lean teams.

What I‚Äôd loveeeee from you:

If you run a store or manage ecommerce data, I‚Äôd love your honest thoughts on what I‚Äôve built so far ‚Äî especially around:
	‚Ä¢	What‚Äôs missing
	‚Ä¢	What feels confusing
	‚Ä¢	What would make it actually useful for you
	‚Ä¢	What data or tasks you wish were easier/faster

I‚Äôm happy to DM access to anyone who wants to try it. Not selling anything right now ‚Äî just want to build something that‚Äôs actually useful.

After an hour of deep and meaningful conversation about what we had shared together he tells me he saw me on Bumble. I didn't see him but I was on for a day and then deleted it. 


Long story short, he ""technically"" has a girlfriend that he met the day after we broke up (together 2 years), and she's desperate to marry him. He's ""trying to get rid of her"". She's apparently fighting for her life to keep him around, and the smirk on his face when he mocked her. My god. 

His response to her angst was to go on Bumble, then contact two other women he dated but didn't get intimate with, have one sleep over last week, and then have a three hour fancy lunch with me, hinting he wants to be friends with benefits. He didn't tell her he was in contact with me. 

I really didn't think at our age people could get MORE self destructive and treat others as this disposable, but here I am, always learning. 

I feel yuck that I am inadvertently part of some long line of women he breadcrumbs to stroke his ego.

The Indian stock market witnessed a mixed performance on June 6, 2025, with varying degrees of movement across several large-cap stocks listed on the BSE.  This comprehensive overview analyzes the trading activity, sector classifications, and technical indicators for a range of prominent companies, offering investors a glimpse into the market's pulse.

**Sectoral Analysis:  A Tale of Two Markets**

The market's performance on this day reveals a diverse landscape, with some sectors experiencing gains while others faced headwinds.  **Auto and related sectors** largely performed well.  **Hero MotoCorp**  (Auto - 2 & 3 Wheelers)  enjoyed a 2.04% gain in one day, with its stock price reaching ‚Çπ4260.1, showcasing a strong upward trajectory. Similarly, **Mahindra & Mahindra** (Auto - Cars & Jeeps) also demonstrated positive momentum, gaining 1.54% to reach ‚Çπ3093.65. **Bajaj Auto** (Auto - 2 & 3 Wheelers) also experienced a positive trend, gaining 0.82% and trading at ‚Çπ8621.  However, **Eicher Motors** (Auto - 2 & 3 Wheelers) saw a comparatively lower one-day increase of 1.32% and a price of ‚Çπ5375. The overall positive performance in the auto sector might be attributed to renewed consumer demand or positive outlook in the sector, although some stocks' performance shows that this positive outlook is not affecting all stocks equally.

The **Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)** sector, as represented by **Shriram Finance**, displayed a strong upward trajectory, surging 5.54% during the day to reach ‚Çπ686.6. This significant gain suggests increased confidence in the financial sector or positive company performance.

In contrast, the **Pharmaceuticals** sector saw mixed results.  **Sun Pharmaceutical Industries** experienced a slight dip of -0.25%, closing at ‚Çπ1679.95. However, **Cipla** displayed a small gain of 0.83%, closing at ‚Çπ1501.45. This performance indicates a possible hesitation in the pharmaceutical industry or the presence of varied factors that are affecting stock performance differently.

The **IT Consulting & Software** sector, represented by **Wipro**, and **Tech Mahindra**, showed a mixed performance.  Wipro showed a slight gain of 0.14% and a price of ‚Çπ248.3, while Tech Mahindra, showing a comparatively higher gain of 0.41% and trading at ‚Çπ1568.5, indicating that the sector's overall performance has been neutral.

**Other key performances:**

*   **Bajaj Finserv** (Holding Company): The stock price settled at ‚Çπ1991, reflecting a one-day gain of 2.29%.
*   **Hindustan Unilever** (Personal Care): saw a price of ‚Çπ2388 with a one-day gain of 0.33%.
*   **Tata Consumer Products** (Tea & Coffee): the price was at ‚Çπ1115.7 with a one-day gain of 0.4%.
*   **Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone** (Port & Port Services): recorded a 1.2% gain, with a final price of ‚Çπ1474.
*   **Adani Enterprises** (Trading):  The price went up by 1.29% and it reached ‚Çπ2536.2.
*   **SBI Life Insurance Company** (Finance - Life Insurance): A moderate increase of 0.16%, reaching ‚Çπ1777.25.
*   **Britannia Industries** (Food Processing & Packaging): a decrease of -0.52% and a final price of ‚Çπ5584.
*   **Bharti Airtel** (Telecom Services): The stock ended at ‚Çπ1871.6, down by -0.37%.
*   **Asian Paints** (Paints/Varnishes): a marginal decline of -0.01% and trading at ‚Çπ2244.2.
*   **ITC** (Cigarettes & Tobacco Products): closed at ‚Çπ420.85, with a marginal gain of 0.32%
*   **Infosys** (IT Consulting & Software): The stock ended at ‚Çπ1559.5, up by 0.26%

**Technical Analysis:  Pivot Points and Resistance Levels**

The provided data also offers insights into the technical levels of the stocks.  Daily pivot levels, resistance levels (R1, R2, R3), and the 52-week high and low are crucial indicators for traders.  For instance, analyzing the pivot level and resistance levels for **Bajaj Finserv** can help investors assess the stock's potential upward movement. The daily pivot level is set at 1947.47 with resistances at 1971.68, 2013.47 and 2037.68. Similarly, for **Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone**, the pivot level is at 1458.07, providing crucial reference points for short-term traders. These technical indicators, combined with the daily and monthly performance figures, can inform investment decisions.

**Long-Term Performance:  A Mixed Bag**

While the one-day performance provides a snapshot of the current market sentiment, the three-month performance data offers a more comprehensive view of the underlying trends. Several stocks, including **Hero MotoCorp** (+16.78%), **Tata Consumer Products** (+16.47%), **Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone** (+29.81%), and **SBI Life Insurance Company** (+25.06%) exhibited strong gains over the past three months.  This indicates sustained positive momentum and could be a sign of investor confidence in those sectors. However, other stocks like **Infosys** (-9.04%) and **Wipro** (-13.11%) show a negative trajectory.

**Overall Market Outlook**

The data indicates a mixed overall market, with certain sectors experiencing significant growth, while others struggle.  Investors are advised to conduct thorough research, considering both daily fluctuations and long-term performance, before making investment decisions. The diverse performance across sectors highlights the importance of diversification and a careful assessment of individual stock fundamentals. It is essential for investors to analyze factors like company performance, sectoral trends, and technical indicators to make informed decisions in a dynamic market.

A short story about The Love Hypothesis, my TBR, and my 2-year hiatus from reading Romance Books.  
  
*It is Labor Day weekend 2021, a man, let's call him u/DadReadsRomanceBooks or 'Dad' for short, reads {The Hating Game by Sally Thorne}. It is the best Romantic Comedy he has ever read. It convinces him of something he had been thinking for about a year and a half...Romance is his favorite literary genre. His decision to read it was due to it being recommended in a request post on r/RomanceBooks. He quickly dives into another recommendation from that post {Headliners by Lucy Parker}. He loves it as well - he finishes it in 1 day. Next he reads another recommendation from that post {Dating You / Hating You by Christina Lauren} he likes it but not as much as The Hating Game or Headliners he drops a few other CRs^1 from that post into his and his TBR^2 list. The date is September 11, 2021.*
  
*A few days later Ali Hazelwood's debut Novel, The Love Hypothesis, releases to instant praise. How much praise? Enough that Dad adds it to his TBR on September 16, 2021, two days after its release. Dad takes a break from Romcoms after finishing {The Boyfriend Project by Farrah Rochon} to read some Romantic Fantasy and Sci-Fi. In early October, Dad's Libby hold for {Magic Bites by Ilona Andrews}, another top recommendation from that post, arrives. From October 2021 to November 2022, Dad would read 23 books, 12 by Ilona Andrews, 4 other sci-fi/ Fantasy Romances, The sequel to The Boyfriend Project, 2 other Romances, and 4 other books. For many reasons 2023 & 2024 would be two of the most challenging years of Dad's life, resulting in Dad only having time to read 6 books over 2 years. Consequently, The Love Hypothesis sat quietly near the top of his TBR for the better part of three years.*
  
*June 1, 2025, The Love Hypothesis makes it to the top of Dad's TBR. June 3, 2025, Dad finishes The Love Hypothesis. It is the best Romantic Comedy he has ever read.*

## Spoiler Free Review  

*The Love Hypothesis* is a FMC/MMC^4 Contemporary Romantic Comedy set at Stanford University in Northern California. Our story revolves around Olive Smith, a doctoral candidate in Stanford's Biology department and her fake dating arrangement with Dr. Adam Carlsen, renowned computational biologist who has a habit of being ~~a complete jagoff~~ needlessly antagonistic and unapproachable. This fake dating relationship is mutually beneficial as Olive wants her best friend, Anh, to feel she can date Jeremy (Olive's X) guilt-free and Adam wants Stanford to release research funding they are holding because they think he is a flight risk.  
  
I had a massive crush on Olive through this entire book. She is smart, thoughtful, caring, driven, and hilarious. Why does such an amazing gal choose a ~~Dickhead~~ needlessly antagonistic and unapproachable professor as a fake boyfriend? Her friends and colleagues have a similar question. She knows the answer cannot be ""I accidentally (but also on purpose) kissed him one night to cover up a lie I told my Anh so she would know I am fully over Jeremy"". So she mostly is stuck stacking up the lies but it will be okay because our #1 girl Olive can get through a little more than a month or so of fake dating this Dr. Makes-His-Grads-Cry-And-Quit. It's just 10 minutes of free ~~coffee~~ sugar sludge and pastries every Wednesday. It makes her friend, who she loves, happy and he's not so bad...what could go wrong?  
  
I had been excited to read this book since its release, which for me means avoiding spoilers like the plague. I knew it was set at a university, I knew the MCs were scientists, and I knew early drafts were a Reylo fic^5 , which is why the MCs are described as looking similar to Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. I did not know anything about what romance tropes it did or did not have or even what the central conflict of the plot. Coincidentally, most of the romance tropes in the book are not ones I have actively sought out. Books with fake dating and/or forced proximity have never sparked my taste. I prefer workplace romances where the MCs are professional equals. While I am not against MCs being oblivious to how much the other MC loves them, I think many times it is at odds with how the character is portrayed otherwise. *The Love Hypothesis* has every one of these tropes, and Ali Hazelwood's execution of each is pristine.  
   
  
Romcom stories end with a Happily Ever After (HEA). My opinion is that since the destination is preordained quality of a romcom is judged on its journey. I think the two most important qualities of that journey are:
1. Each MC earns the HEA - I fall in love with them as individuals.
2. The MC's relationship earns the HEA - I fall in love with them as a couple.
Every moment of Adam and Olive's journey is full of joy and love. This journey is beautiful.  
  
I loved every page of *The Love Hypothesis*, but I also kept half a heart^6 from it. One thing drove me crazy the entire time I was reading it. **It is begging to be dual perspective.** I was yearning to be inside Adam's head^(>!maybe as much as he was yearning to be inside Olive!<) and to see Olive through his eyes. In all fairness, I am a straight man^7 and my default preference is dual perspective; however, Ali Hazelwood's writing is so outstanding that it made me want it that much more.^8   
  
**What I loved about this book**

* Olive. (Highly educated, brilliant, nerdy, incredibly competent, and professionally passionate brunettes who sass their friends and lovers are kind of my thing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
* The burn is slow, the playful banter is plentiful, the yearning is intense, and the payoff is üßë‚Äçüç≥ü§åüíã.
* The side characters are given enough time and personality for us to actually care about them.  
  
  
**What I did not like about this book**^(Other than the lack of Adam's perspective)

* There are a lot of opinions about food in this book, how are more than 50% of them incorrect?
* ~~Adam is tall. We get it 95% of MMCs in Romance books are over 6' despite <15% of men being over 6' tall...you do realize that Oh! Oh!~~   
  
## Spoilers Review  

>!I was surprised to see that the fake dating lasts nearly the entirety of the story. There were times in the middle where I was a bit frustrated at Olive. Honey, it could not be more obvious that this man adores you. Please have the confidence of a mediocre white man for like 5 seconds and examine the way he looks at you. Ultimately, I realized that Olive's obliviousness made sense for her as a character and improved the ultimate payoff. On a related note, the whole ""they think the other one loves somebody else, they because they love them and are selfless they want them to be with that person so they are happy"" might be a trope I need more of in my life.!<  
  
>!As the plot developed, I was worried the Act 3 conflict would be a letdown. I was terrified when the fake dating was clearly going to be most of the book, and that the plot was headed to a 9 month+ time jump before they admitted their true feelings (e.g. one of them goes to Harvard hoping the space will help them get over the other one). So even though I figured Tom would end up being the jagoff Holden thinks he is, I was not expecting the jagoff reveal right after Olive's presentation, nor was I expecting him to be **that** kind of jagoff üñï. It was awful, too real, and heartbreaking. Then ultimately (following amongst other things some pretty great spice) we get a love confession that puts all the rest to shame, delivered simultaneously with his comeuppance. What a great book!üíï!<   
  
   
**What I loved Spoilers**

* >!Consent‚úÖ, reconfirming consent‚úÖ, confirming consent is enthusiastic‚úÖ, reluctance to take advantage of emotions ‚úÖ, AND communicating and adjusting sex-acts to your partner's needs and wants‚úÖ? Hey, wait a minute is this smut about passion-filled love making?‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•!<
* >!Sitting on your faculty member boyfriend's lap during an hour-long lecture is not appropriate professional behavior. It is an incredible way to build tension in a romcom though.!<
* >!The sass in this book is great, but the best sass is Ali Hazelwood's sly remarks about academia. Preach!!<
* >!One of the things that irks me about the ""MMC is a giant"" trope is that the many ergonomic challenges of significant height disparities often go ignored. We get it here.üôèüèΩ!<
  >!I melted when Adam texted a picture of the sugar abomination to Olive from Boston.!<  
  
**What I didn't like Spoilers**

* >!Are we supposed to believe that two brilliant biologists do not know what UTIs are or they do not exist in this world? It only stood out because the spice felt so authentic.!<  
    
    
### This Book Reminded Me of
* The quality of humor in {Headliners by Lucy Parker}
* The slow burn and subsequent payoff of {The Hating Game by Sally Thorne}
* The MC chemistry of {Mindf*ck by S. T. Abby}

Buttercup was tasked with getting mojo out of there and keep him from getting infected, but his arrogance wouldn‚Äôt let him be defeated again, even during an invasion. So with one pull of a lever, his robotic hand came across quickly and hit buttercup head on. Soon after though, monsters flooded his suit, infecting him anyway. Buttercup crashed into a wall, the monsters all flocking to the noise. And before blossom could get to her in time, she became infected as well. 

Blossoms world turned upside down in an instant, a pain in her stomach as she saw her sister, infected. If only she had been faster, she would still be here. But she also knew that like this..buttercup was too much of a risk now. So with wet eyes, and before fusion buttercup could attack her, she froze her solid. Blossom called bubbles over, begging her to take buttercup to Dexter to see if he could help her. She nodded and flew off to the lab, tears running down her face.

Blossom then realized that her father, professor utonium was still at home and possibly in danger. So she made the hard decision, retreating and flying to her house. She hoped that his intellect could help fix this situation, but more than that she just needed him to be ok. 

But as she got to the house, she found it damaged, clearly broken into by..something.  She walked inside, green goo splattered along the walls and floor. The professor had indeed put up a good fight, but as she walked into the kitchen‚Ä¶she let out a small wail, her father was sitting down sipping some coffee‚Ä¶but he was infected. But not only did he have the same gooey green skin like buttercup, but had 4 tentacles on his back made out of fusion matter.

She couldn‚Äôt move, everything was spinning and she found it hard to stand. She wasn‚Äôt a small child anymore, but she was still just a dumb kid, barely even a teen, and yet she lost a sister and her father in the span on less than an hour. 

He set his drink down, recognizing the girl as utoniums daughter. He introduced himself, his voice filtered in an unnatural way, like he was possessed almost. He called himself professor plutonium, differing himself from the other fusions.  He was less of a mindless animal like other fusions, more aware and capable of thought

She fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face as she sobbed. She called out the professors name, only to be met with laughter by Plutonium. He mocked her, asking if this was really the hero utonium remembered. 

He spoke coldly, saying that she had no use running or fighting back. That her body and mind would be corrupted and used to make this invasion easier for lord Fuse. The planet would become fully corrupted, die, and then be consumed by Lord Fuse, and if any of them were lucky, they would be used in his army for the future. 

He walked over to her, she was frozen, unable to move her body. And as his tentacle went in for the finishing blow, the roof suddenly caved in, crushing him under rubble. And floating down..was none other than brick! He saw from the window that she needed help, apologizing for the mess. 

She reaches out for the professor, but brick held her back, he knew it was too late. He told her they needed to escape while they could, and that they could check on him later when they had more manpower. She reluctantly agreed with him, but asked why he was being so..uncharacteristically nice. So..he told his side of the story of that day.

The rowdy rough boys were causing trouble on the northwest side of Townsville when l the invasion happened. Monsters started forming around them, and not knowing the danger, immediately went to fighting. Butch tried to punch one of them with fists, which lead to him becoming infected. Boomer used a sonic screech to hold the rest of the monsters back and the two of them raced off for reinforcements to help their brother. Boomer went looking for ‚ÄúHim‚Äù, the one who brought them back to life, while brick tried to find the girls. 

And in a weird turn of events, blossom hugged him, and he..hugged back. They both lost a sibling that day, they finally had something to relate to each other. And well..she did appreciate that he saved her life and all. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt so bad at his core after all? He blushes and studdored, saying they should get going

But rubble moved slightly behind him, and in an instant.. a tentacle shot right though the rubble, and impaled brick, the blood going from a dark red and slowly taking more and more of a green hue. She yelled at blossom, telling her to run, to find his brother, and keep him safe since..he can‚Äôt anymore. What a big brother he was he thought..he couldn‚Äôt protect his two baby brothers when they needed him most (they were triplets, but he always said he was the older one).

He then..confessed that he always loved her, and was sorry that he never cleaned up his act sooner, before telling her to go again. She simply held back tears, nodded, and flew off. 

Professor plutonium laughed at bricks words, and his futile attempts to resist the infection. He was going to die with regrets, and couldn‚Äôt even stop the bad guy, dying a useless death. But..brick wasn‚Äôt going down without a fight. He took a deep breath, and then screamed so loud you could hear it for miles, the entire house becoming incased with a thick block of ice, keeping them both frozen until they could later be extracted and taken in to dexters lab. 

And all this time? ‚ÄúHim‚Äù was in his own little dimension, watching the invasion like a tv show. Going oooooo, and sitting on the edge of his seat over the drama. 

Eventually boomer gave up on his search, and ran into bubbles as she came back into town trying to find blossom. They both caught up and raced to the professors house, running into blossom on the way. Blossom told them both about the news, of brick and the professor. They all mourned in the sky for a brief moment, before settling at the KND base to regroup and come up with a plan.

Blossom from that moment on became a valuable member of the resistance against fuse, with her dual ice breath and heat vision ability. She works with Dexter sometimes to keep the chambers cool in case of any tech issues, and they two formed a sort of friendship. They both lost their sisters and parents due to this war, but dexters walls wouldn‚Äôt allow him to get closer than that with anyone until he finally made the cure. But even still, the nights where dexter would fall asleep at his work desk, she would sometimes check on him, covering him with a blanket at least.

Dexter and professor plutonium formed almost a rivalry when he was detained. Dexters interrogations leading nowhere as the professor knew just how to push all of Dexters buttons. After almost escaping one time, he‚Äôs been deemed too dangerous to let out of containment, and a last possible choice of curing if it‚Äôs even possible new just how to push all of Dexters buttons. After almost escaping one time, he‚Äôs been deemed too dangerous to let out of containment, and a last possible choice of curing if it‚Äôs even possible

1l5drmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l5drmb/how_to_choose_your_grind_size/,How to Choose Your Grind Size,"Grind size is one of the most important things when brewing coffee. It determines how quickly the water can penetrate the grounds and how long the coffee and water will be in contact. So how do you choose a grind size?

* **Bigger dose, coarser grind**: why does a bigger dose mean a coarser grind? Since higher dose equals higher grind and makes the water flow through the coffee grounds slower, we need to coarsen the grind size to maintain the water flow rate
* **Dripper Shape**: similar to the first point, each dripper has its own geometry which means different ground heights, so when you brew the same dose in a v60 and a flat bottom like a Kalita Wave, you can use a coarser grind in a v60, because the ground coffee in a v60 is taller compared to a Kalita
* **Extraction Speed**: finer grind equals faster extraction, espresso uses a finer grind size because it is only brewed for a few seconds, so when we use the pour over method, we need to adjust it based on how fast we want to extract our coffee, there is no bypass dripper like a Tricolate that takes 4 minutes or more to brew so we need to coarsen our grind to maintain its extraction speed

So, do you have anything else in mind for choosing a grind size? Or do you disagree with my opinion?",2,1749275963.0,pourover,0,0.75,False

**Title:** I (28F) found a woman‚Äôs sock in my house after being away for a week and my boyfriend (30M) lied to me about it.

I was away for a week for work. He was off work nearly this entire time as he works one week on, one week off. When I came home, my boyfriend had cleaned the house up quite extensively. Obviously not a crime in itself, but it was surprising and a little out of character. I usually have to do most of the cleaning, so it was unexpected. He‚Äôd even picked up some of my laundry that I‚Äôd left in the washroom and living room and put it in the basket. I was surprised but I didn‚Äôt think much of it.

He started night shifts the day after I returned and I was working days so I came home from work after he‚Äôd left. I figured I‚Äôd spend some time cleaning the house too as he‚Äôd done. There‚Äôs a shop vac that‚Äôd been sitting just outside of our bedroom door for a few weeks that I finally moved to the closet. When I moved it, I found a sock just behind it. A small ankle sock, obviously women‚Äôs in a brand that I‚Äôve never seen before. I had a bad feeling by this point but I put the sock on a table by my bedside and continued cleaning, intending to ask him about it when he returned from work early in the morning.

When I asked him whose sock it was, he said he didn‚Äôt know. He then said he found it on the stairs and thought it was mine, so he put it there. But I put the sock there. I doubt he‚Äôd even seen it around the house or else it wouldn‚Äôt have been behind the shop vac. And if he had seen it and thought it was mine, wouldn‚Äôt he have put it in the basket with my other clothes that he‚Äôd put away?

I told him that I put the sock there and asked him why he lied about putting it there. He said he didn‚Äôt have anybody over and he didn‚Äôt know whose sock it is. I left and got ready for work and he went to sleep.

Any advice on how to address this?

***Top Comment:*** 

**Chupacabrona:** He lied about how the sock got there, first off. And when you confronted him about why he lied, he deflected with an entirely different answer you didn‚Äôt even ask about ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have anyone over.‚Äù - but you didn‚Äôt ask if he did. You asked why he lied.

It doesn‚Äôt really matter who the sock belongs to now - what matters is it‚Äôs NOT yours, and he lied to you several times about it.

Do you want to stay with someone who would lie about anything?

**Update 1 (Same Post): Same Day**

UPDATE: I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to update in less than 48 hours as per community rules. But he woke up. I‚Äôm sitting here in my office area, doing some work but also periodically crying and reading the comments here. He came into the room and tried cuddling me from behind my chair. I was obviously stiff and he asked me why I was mad at him. I said that I didn‚Äôt know why he wasn‚Äôt honest with me earlier about the sock. He said he didn‚Äôt lie to me. I said I put the sock there on the table so he couldn‚Äôt have. He said that he‚Äôd meant he‚Äôd found the sock while cleaning and he‚Äôd tossed it aside (landing forgotten behind the shop vac). 

He then got super mad, saying that I‚Äôm always accusing him of cheating. Swearing around and saying that he‚Äôs not coming on our trip to my parents‚Äô house during the summer and that he‚Äôs staying at the house all summer and that a friend of mine who was supposed to rent the house for work during the summer can‚Äôt stay there then because he‚Äôll be here. I asked him why he was getting so mad and said that I‚Äôd been upset and I just needed an explanation and reassurance from him. He continued to lose it. Stormed towards the door and threw his cup full of coffee down the stairs. Grabbed an old baseball bat that we keep by the stairs and started hitting the step outside the door yelling that he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fucking cheating‚Äù. Threw his lunch that he‚Äôd packed for work all over the steps and peeled off in his truck.

**Update 2 (Same Post): May 31, 2025 (2 days from OG post)**

We broke up. As a lot of the comments have said too, it wasn‚Äôt really about the sock anymore. Maybe I won‚Äôt ever know what happened while I was away, but the violence in his response was frightening and I don‚Äôt want to be with someone that makes me feel unsafe in my home. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen him that angry, but it‚Äôs the first time that he‚Äôs done something so physical and I don‚Äôt want to be involved if it continues to escalate. 

He‚Äôs been taking some of his stuff while I‚Äôve been out of the house (and one of our dogs which has been probably the most upsetting out of all of this) and I‚Äôve been changing the lock code after each time. I have some friends that live nearby that I‚Äôve explained the situation to and they‚Äôve assured me I can contact them if I ever end up in an unsafe situation. 

Thank you to everyone that has offered advice, shared their own experiences, or expressed concern for my safety in the comments. There will be a lot of changes in my life upcoming due to this but I know it‚Äôs for the best.",280,1749275131.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,34,0.98,False

The gaslighting, the emotional abuse, the verbal abuse, the alcoholism. I was convinced that if I loved him hard enough, then he would get better and love me back. Wrong. 

We fought constantly. He would threaten me if he didn't like what I had to say with, ""if you don't stop talking, I won't be responsible for what happened."" Kind of like how he got drunk and pushed me backwards. He told me that was my fault as well. Or the time he bashed a hole into my bathroom wall with his head. My fault. 

When I was the one staying at home with my youngest, I didn't do enough according to him. I would get up at 5 am with him on his work days. Pack a full lunchbox with homemade meals and snacks and a fresh coffee. I waited on him hand and foot but it wasn't enough. I sat down and asked him one day what I needed to do to get him to love me the way I so desperately wanted. ""Get a fucking job."" Meanwhile I'm raising a toddler who can't go to school and we can't afford daycare. I already promised I'd work as soon as she started school but again, not good enough.

 So, I got a job. Work from home. Not even two weeks later. 
I wasn't sure how I was gonna make it work but I was willing to do whatever. He was thrilled. Promised we'd be dual income and we'd be so much better off for it. Get fucking pranked. He quit his job without telling me before I even started. We had no income for three weeks. I had to get help from neighbors to pay the bills and went to the local food bank here. He was shameless.  

Then, he told me that he was going to be the stay at home step-dad and do everything that I did and then some but there was a catch. He wouldn't do it for two months at least. He wanted to be lazy and play video games while I worked 40 hour weeks, cooked, cleaned and took care of the children. Solid fucking deal. How could I say no. Especially when he told me that he could do everything that I did in one day in four hours or less. Insinuating that I was shit at time management and chores. Not true but okay. 

Guess what. Two months passed and then six months and then a year and then two years. Still fought. I was on the edge of killing myself between dealing with the workload of my job and the house. Him? He was sleeping in until midafternoon, getting high and playing league of legends. 

In-between all of that time was a suspended license, a court date that he avoided because I paid his fine on unpaid child support for a kid who isn't mine and no desire to get a job until I crashed out on him that August. 


I realized in August that he wasn't going to change after a fight we had over me mourning what should have been my first day of college. He had agreed to get his GED and take over earning the money so I could drop to part time and get started on my career. Two years were wasted. He would wake up, get high and play league of legends until he went to bed late at night. If I asked him to get out of the house with me to do something mundane like groceries, he gripe and fuss and throw a fits because he had to do something besides rot at his desk. 

I had zero help with chores, finances, bills, nothing. All of it was on me. I'd work ten hours a day, clock out and play mommy to him. The only time he moved was to get a drink or go to the bathroom.

I *let* this person treat me like absolute shit for nothing. I ended it with him two days ago while he was in a different state for a job that he didn't get. I had several talks with God, my mother, my friends, anyone who knew my situation. Guilt ate at me for nearly four months for being done. He promised that this job would change our lives and that he would treat me the way that I deserved. He was going to be a new man. I waited five years for him to treat me like a person instead of an animal. All the money in the world wouldn't have gotten me to stay. So before he got the chance to accuse me of using him for his money, I jumped ship. If there is one definite thing about me, I'm not a user but I am a people pleaser to a fault and I'm the one who gets used. Obviously. 

I haven't spoken to him in two days. He texted me while I was getting ready for bed while on a drunken bender. Telling me that I was a coward and that I was just as bad of a person as my father. That me leaving him was a blessing and that his friend who's a hacker has permission from him to essentially get into his computer here at my house and do what he pleases with the information he can pull from my computer. A stark fucking reminder that I made the right choice. He kept preaching that he was a changed man, found God. The whole shebang and he slid back right into his abusive, manipulative tactics with zero hesitation. He hasn't changed. He's not going to change. 

I'm glad I left and if you're stalking my reddit account like you probably are since I have zero privacy, fuck you. 

Tl;dr I left a highly volatile and abusive relationship and he's making threats since I finally found the balls to choose myself over him. ",1,1749274839.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

When I actually try and extract the coffee, I get a few drops. Before I adjusted the internal grind, it was working fine.

I‚Äôm not here to pitch anything ‚Äî just hoping to learn from people actively running stores and dealing with the real day-to-day.



**\\What I‚Äôm building:**

Flexi is an AI-powered spreadsheet-meets-database interface. It connects to your existing platforms (starting with Google Sheets, and now I‚Äôm working on Shopify), pulls in your product, order, and customer data, and gives you one flexible place to analyze it, clean it, enrich it, and even automate content or workflows using AI.

Instead of building a rigid dashboard or one-off reporting tool, I wanted to create something that feels like a powerful workspace ‚Äî where you can manipulate your data freely, generate insights, write product descriptions, create new images, and build your own systems without code.



**Why I‚Äôm building it:**

I‚Äôve helped a few small Shopify brands and saw the same patterns over and over:

* Spreadsheets everywhere
* Repetitive content work
* Manual reporting
* Not enough time to actually *think* about the business

I started Flexi to take the flexibility of Sheets and combine it with the kind of AI support and automation that saves time and makes growth easier ‚Äî especially for solo founders or lean teams.

Here‚Äôs the ecommerce use case page if you‚Äôre curious: [**https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce**](https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce)



**What I‚Äôd loveeeee from you:**

If you run a store or manage ecommerce data, I‚Äôd love your honest thoughts on what I‚Äôve built so far ‚Äî especially around:

* What‚Äôs missing
* What feels confusing
* What would make it actually useful for you
* What data or tasks you wish were easier/faster

I‚Äôm happy to DM access to anyone who wants to try it. Not selling anything right now ‚Äî just want to build something that‚Äôs actually useful.

And yep ‚Äî your next coffee‚Äôs on me if you take a few minutes to play with it and give some feedback. Thanks for reading :)",2,1749273881.0,ecommerce,1,1.0,False

But today? Today I discovered that selecting files in the Trash and hitting ‚åò + Delete (yes, the same shortcut that sends files to the Trash)‚Ä¶ instead restores them. All of them. Instantly. No prompt. No warning!!

Hundreds of files came blasting out of the Trash like a confetti cannon. Banana peel? Back on the counter. Coffee filter, grounds and all? Neatly placed back in the machine. The digital waste teleported back into folders, across drives, without any indication it had happened at all... save for the empty bin.

Could I have pressed ‚åòZ? Sure, I suppose, but remember, I was given no indication of what had just happened.

Is this a bug? A feature? Performance art? If this is a prank, I'm not even mad, I'm impressed! Apple, you got me good!! üòÇ

Anyway, I tried to ask about it on Apple Discussions and got these genius replies: (paraphrasing)

‚ÄúJust press ‚åòZ lol‚Äù

‚ÄúThe shortcut was in the Finder menu, so you should have known about it already.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever heard of that, sounds like you hit the wrong thing.‚Äù

One Apple tech dude doubled down, saying: ""Just to add, it makes perfect sense."" üòÇ

Why is ‚åò + Delete mapped to both trashing and restoring files? Is there a way I could alter how this shortcut works?

first, there is no separation anymore. your house is your office, your office is your house. you wake up, roll out of bed, and boom, you are at work. no transition, no mental reset. i used to love leaving the office, feeling that shift from work mode to home mode. now, it is all blurred together. i catch myself thinking about emails at midnight or staring at my laptop during dinner. it is like work never ends, because it does not have to.

then there is the isolation. sure, you can chat with coworkers online, but it is not the same. those random hallway talks or coffee runs with colleagues. gone. i have not made a single new work friend since going remote three years ago. my social circle is shrinking, and i did not even realize it until i started feeling weirdly lonely on a random tuesday. humans need real interaction, not just slack messages.

productivity is a lie too. people act like they get so much more done at home, but i call bullshit. i am distracted all the time. laundry, dishes, the cat, that package at the door. at the office, i had focus. now, i am lucky if i string together two solid hours without wandering off. studies even back this up, some say remote workers log more hours just to get the same output. we are working harder for less, and we do not see it.

and do not get me started on health. sitting in the same chair all day, no walk to the train or stairs to climb. i have gained weight, my back hurts, and i barely leave the house. the office forced me to move, to see daylight. now, i am a cave troll with a wifi connection.

i know the counterarguments. commuting sucks, offices can be toxic, flexibility is great. yeah, those are real. i hated my hour long drive too. but at least it gave me structure, a reason to get up and out. remote work trades one set of problems for a sneakier, worse set. it is not freedom, it is a slow slide into burnout and boredom.

so, am i crazy. does anyone else feel like working from home is not the paradise we were sold. or am i just bad at it.",116,1749273460.0,unpopularopinion,125,0.66,False

1l5d0lq,https://youtu.be/GPvfd0gSmzc,3 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Living Horror Stories,"# ""We Were Never Alone in Those Woods"":

I‚Äôd always wanted to break free from the city‚Äîits endless noise, the crowded streets, the constant buzz of stress. My wife, Emma, felt the same. We talked about it for years, dreaming of a quiet life where we could grow our own food, live simply, and breathe fresh air. So when we found a cheap plot of land deep in the Oregon wilderness, it felt like fate. The realtor warned us it was remote‚Äîthree hours from the nearest town, down a winding dirt road that barely qualified as a path. We didn‚Äôt care. We sold most of our belongings, bought a used RV, and moved out there with our dog, Rusty, a scruffy mutt who loved chasing anything that moved. We were ready to start our off-grid adventure, to build a cabin and live on our terms. But from the moment we arrived, something about the place felt off, like the forest itself was watching us.The land was stunning‚Äîacres of towering pines, a small clearing perfect for the RV, and a creek nearby that gurgled softly day and night. But it was so isolated. The dirt road to our plot took 20 minutes to navigate, all ruts and rocks, and the nearest neighbor was a guy named Tom, who lived a mile away in a sagging trailer surrounded by junk. When we met him, he seemed friendly, offering us a jar of homemade blackberry jam. ‚ÄúNot many folks make it out here long,‚Äù he said, his eyes flicking over our RV, then back to us. ‚ÄúToo quiet for most. Gets in your head.‚Äù His smile was thin, like he knew something we didn‚Äôt. Emma squeezed my hand, her fingers cold. I laughed it off, thanking him for the jam, but as we walked away, I felt his stare on my back.The first few days were busy. We parked the RV in the clearing, set up a fire pit with stones from the creek, and started clearing brush for the cabin‚Äôs foundation. Rusty bounded through the trees, barking at squirrels and rolling in the dirt. During the day, the forest felt alive‚Äîbirds chirping, wind rustling the pines. But at night, it changed. The silence was so thick it felt like a weight on my chest. I‚Äôd lie awake, listening, waiting for something to break it. Sometimes, I‚Äôd hear a branch snap or leaves crunch, like something heavy moving through the underbrush. I‚Äôd tell myself it was deer or maybe a bear, but when I looked out the RV‚Äôs window, I never saw anything. Emma felt it too. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too quiet,‚Äù she said one night, her voice low as she stirred soup on our propane stove. ‚ÄúLike the forest is holding its breath.‚Äù I hugged her, trying to laugh it off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just new,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get used to it.‚ÄùAbout a week in, things started getting weird. One morning, we found Rusty‚Äôs water bowl tipped over, the ground around it muddy with what looked like boot prints‚Äîbig ones, too wide to be mine or Emma‚Äôs. They circled the RV, then trailed off into the trees. My stomach knotted up. ‚ÄúMaybe Tom stopped by,‚Äù I said, but Emma shook her head. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd have said something. And why spill Rusty‚Äôs water?‚Äù She was right. It didn‚Äôt make sense. We decided to keep Rusty inside at night and started locking the RV door, something we hadn‚Äôt bothered with before. That night, I barely slept, my ears straining for any sound. Around 3 a.m., Rusty growled, low and deep, his eyes fixed on the window. I grabbed the flashlight and scanned the clearing. Nothing but shadows. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, boy,‚Äù I whispered, but my heart was pounding.The next day, I drove to Tom‚Äôs trailer to ask if he‚Äôd seen anyone. His place was a mess‚Äîrusted car parts, a sagging tarp over a half-built shed, empty beer cans scattered around. He was sitting outside, whittling a stick, the blade of his knife glinting as it moved. ‚ÄúFootprints?‚Äù he said, not looking up. ‚ÄúCould be anybody. These woods are old. Lot of folks pass through‚Äîhunters, drifters, people who don‚Äôt like being found.‚Äù He paused, his eyes meeting mine. ‚ÄúSome say there‚Äôs old camps out there, abandoned shacks. People who don‚Äôt take kindly to new faces.‚Äù His voice was calm, but there was an edge to it, like he was testing me. I asked if he‚Äôd been by our place. He chuckled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNot me. But you might wanna get a gun. Never know who‚Äôs out there.‚Äù I nodded, trying to act casual, but my skin was crawling as I drove back.When I told Emma, her face went pale. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù she said, pacing the RV‚Äôs tiny kitchen. ‚ÄúI keep feeling like someone‚Äôs watching us. Yesterday, when I was by the creek, I heard something moving in the bushes. I thought it was Rusty, but he was right next to me.‚Äù Her voice cracked, and I pulled her close. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre okay,‚Äù I said, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I believed it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stick together, keep the doors locked, and I‚Äôll get a signal booster for the phone.‚Äù The nearest town was too far for a quick trip, but I promised we‚Äôd go soon. For now, we‚Äôd stay vigilant.That night, we triple-checked the locks and kept Rusty‚Äôs leash short, tying him to the bed frame. I kept a kitchen knife and a heavy flashlight by my side, useless as they‚Äôd probably be against anything serious. Around midnight, it started. A faint tapping, like someone knocking on a tree. Tap. Tap. Tap. Rusty‚Äôs ears perked up, and he growled, his fur bristling. Emma grabbed my arm. ‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù she whispered. I nodded, my mouth dry. The tapping grew louder, closer, moving from the trees to the edge of the clearing. Then came a scraping sound, slow and deliberate, like something dragging along the RV‚Äôs metal side. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch. My heart was hammering so hard I thought it‚Äôd burst.‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù I said, grabbing the flashlight and knife. Emma‚Äôs eyes were wide with panic. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare go out there!‚Äù she hissed, clutching Rusty, who was now barking like mad. I cracked the window, shining the flashlight into the dark. The beam caught nothing but trees, their branches swaying slightly. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs out there?‚Äù I shouted, my voice shaking. Silence. Then, from somewhere in the woods, a voice‚Äîlow, gravelly, almost a growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù It was so clear, so close, it felt like ice in my veins. I slammed the window shut, locking it, and stumbled back to Emma. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù she whispered, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said, my voice barely steady. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not opening that door.‚ÄùThe tapping and scraping went on for what felt like hours, sometimes stopping for a few minutes, then starting again, closer or farther away, like whoever it was‚Äîor whatever‚Äîwas circling us, toying with us. Rusty kept growling, his teeth bared, and Emma clung to me, whispering, ‚ÄúPlease, make it stop.‚Äù I banged on the RV wall, shouting, ‚ÄúGet out of here! Leave us alone!‚Äù It didn‚Äôt help. The sounds kept coming, relentless, until just before dawn, when they finally stopped. We sat there, frozen, waiting for daylight.When the sun rose, we stepped outside, shaking, to check the RV. The sides were covered in fresh scratches‚Äîlong, jagged marks in the paint, too deep to be from branches or animals. Around the clearing, more boot prints, some smudged, like someone had been pacing. Worst of all, we found Rusty‚Äôs favorite toy‚Äîa chewed-up tennis ball‚Äîsliced clean in half, left right by the fire pit. I felt sick. Emma was crying again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow.‚ÄùWe packed in a frenzy, throwing clothes and gear into bags, not caring what we left behind. As we loaded the RV, I noticed something carved into a pine tree at the edge of the clearing‚Äîa rough symbol, a circle with three jagged lines slashed through it. It wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. My stomach churned, but I didn‚Äôt say anything to Emma. She was already on edge, clutching Rusty like a lifeline. As we drove down the dirt road, I glanced in the rearview mirror and saw Tom standing by his trailer, watching us. He didn‚Äôt wave, didn‚Äôt move‚Äîjust stood there, his face blank, a shadow against the trees.We made it to a motel in town and collapsed, exhausted but too scared to sleep. Over the next few days, I dug into local forums and news archives, looking for answers. There were stories‚Äîhikers disappearing, strange carvings found on trees, whispers of people living deep in the woods, territorial and hostile to outsiders. One post mentioned a group of drifters who‚Äôd been spotted over the years, moving between abandoned cabins, leaving marks like the one I‚Äôd seen. No one knew who they were, and the police rarely investigated‚Äîtoo far out, too little evidence. Another article mentioned a couple who‚Äôd abandoned their off-grid homestead after finding similar scratches on their trailer and hearing voices at night. It felt like we‚Äôd dodged something dark.We never went back. The RV‚Äôs still out there, for all I know, along with our dreams of off-grid living. We‚Äôre back in the city now, in a small apartment, where the hum of traffic feels safer than that suffocating silence. Sometimes, I wake up at night, hearing that tapping in my mind. Tap. Tap. Tap. Emma doesn‚Äôt talk about it, but she keeps a light on when she sleeps, and Rusty stays close, like he knows something we don‚Äôt. I still don‚Äôt know who‚Äîor what‚Äîwas out there, circling our RV, whispering in the dark. But I know we weren‚Äôt alone in those woods, and I‚Äôm not sure we ever would‚Äôve been.

  


# ""The Man in the Trees"":

I‚Äôd been living in my cabin near North Pond, Maine, for about four months, chasing a simpler life away from the city‚Äôs noise. The cabin was small, made of weathered logs, with a slanted roof and a stone fireplace. It sat in a clearing, surrounded by dense pine trees that blocked out the world. No neighbors for miles, just me and the quiet. At first, it was perfect‚Äîmornings spent chopping wood, afternoons hiking trails, and evenings reading by the fire‚Äôs glow. The air smelled of sap and earth, and I felt free. But then, things started going wrong.It began with small stuff. I left a flashlight on the porch table one night, and by morning, it was gone. I figured I‚Äôd knocked it off, maybe an animal took it. A few days later, a bag of chips vanished from the kitchen counter. I searched every cupboard, thinking I‚Äôd misplaced it, but found nothing. Then my favorite jacket‚Äîa thick green one I hung by the door‚Äîdisappeared. I tore the cabin apart, checking under the creaky floorboards, behind the couch, even in the tiny loft where I slept. Nothing. My stomach churned. I wasn‚Äôt just losing things; someone was taking them.I drove my old pickup to the general store in town, a 30-minute trip down a winding dirt road. The store was a cluttered place, shelves stuffed with canned goods and fishing gear, the kind of spot where locals lingered to gossip. While grabbing coffee and batteries, I overheard two men at the counter, their voices low. ‚ÄúHeard the hermit hit another cabin last week,‚Äù one said, scratching his beard. ‚ÄúTook a whole case of soup.‚Äù The other nodded. ‚ÄúFolks say he‚Äôs a ghost, but I reckon he‚Äôs just a guy who don‚Äôt like people.‚Äù I froze, clutching my basket. The ‚ÄúNorth Pond Hermit‚Äù was a local legend, a man who supposedly lived in the woods and stole from cabins to survive. Some thought he was a myth; others swore they‚Äôd seen him. A woman behind the counter, her apron stained with coffee, leaned in. ‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt hurt nobody, but it‚Äôs creepy, knowing he‚Äôs out there, watching.‚Äù My skin prickled. Was he watching me?Back at the cabin, I couldn‚Äôt shake the unease. The trees felt closer, their shadows heavier. I checked the windows‚Äîsimple latches, easy to jimmy‚Äîand the front and back doors, both with flimsy locks. If someone wanted in, they wouldn‚Äôt need much effort. I ordered a motion-sensor alarm online, a small white box that screeched if anything moved nearby, and swapped the old locks for heavy deadbolts. It cost me half a paycheck, but I needed to feel safe. For a week, everything was fine. Then, one morning, I found a loaf of bread and a can of beans missing from the pantry. The alarm hadn‚Äôt gone off. The doors were still locked, no windows broken. It was like he‚Äôd walked through the walls. My heart raced as I realized he must‚Äôve come while I was asleep, just feet from my bed.I stopped sleeping well after that. Every creak of the cabin, every rustle outside, sent my pulse spiking. I started keeping a baseball bat by my bed, its smooth wood a small comfort. I‚Äôd lie awake, staring at the ceiling, imagining footsteps circling the cabin. The isolation, once peaceful, now felt like a trap. I considered leaving, but I‚Äôd sunk everything into this place‚Äîmy savings, my dreams of a quieter life. I wasn‚Äôt ready to give up. So, I decided to catch him.One night, I turned off all the lights and sat in the dark living room, the bat across my lap. The cabin was silent except for the faint crackle of the fire dying in the hearth. I‚Äôd propped a chair under the front door handle and left the back door unlocked, a risky bait. If he was coming, that‚Äôs where he‚Äôd try. I waited, eyes locked on the door, my hands sweaty around the bat. The clock on the mantle ticked past midnight, then one, then two. My eyelids grew heavy, but I forced them open, sipping cold coffee to stay alert. Just as I thought I couldn‚Äôt stay awake any longer, I heard it‚Äîa soft scrape, like a boot brushing the wooden steps outside. My breath caught. The doorknob jiggled, slow and deliberate, then turned.The back door creaked open, and a figure slipped inside, moving with a quiet grace, like he‚Äôd done this a hundred times. He was thin, his frame swallowed by tattered clothes‚Äîa frayed jacket, pants patched with duct tape. Long, greasy hair hung past his shoulders, and a scruffy beard covered most of his face. He didn‚Äôt see me in the corner, my body pressed against the wall. He moved to the kitchen, his steps silent on the floorboards, and started rifling through my pantry, pulling out a can of soup. My heart pounded so loud I was sure he‚Äôd hear it. I gripped the bat, took a shaky breath, and stepped forward.‚ÄúStop right there!‚Äù My voice cracked, louder than I meant.He froze, the can in his hand, and turned slowly. His eyes, wide and sunken, locked onto mine. They weren‚Äôt angry or wild‚Äîjust tired, like he‚Äôd seen too much. For a moment, we just stared, the air thick with tension. I held the bat high, my arms trembling.‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I demanded, trying to sound tough.He didn‚Äôt answer, just stood there, clutching the soup. His silence unnerved me more than any threat would have.‚ÄúWhy are you stealing from me?‚Äù I said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúThis is my home. You can‚Äôt just walk in!‚ÄùHis voice came out soft, raspy, like he hadn‚Äôt spoken in weeks. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to scare you. I just‚Ä¶ need things to get by.‚ÄùHis words hit me like a punch. He wasn‚Äôt some monster, just a man, thin and worn, surviving in a way I couldn‚Äôt imagine. I lowered the bat a fraction. ‚ÄúAre you the hermit? The North Pond guy?‚ÄùHe nodded, eyes dropping to the floor. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they call me.‚ÄùMy mind raced. Part of me wanted to call the sheriff, have him hauled away. But another part saw the desperation in his hunched shoulders, the way his hands shook slightly. He didn‚Äôt look dangerous, just lost. ‚ÄúWhy my cabin?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy keep coming back?‚Äù‚ÄúI know when you‚Äôre gone,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúYou leave for town every Tuesday. It‚Äôs easier then.‚ÄùA chill ran through me. He‚Äôd been watching, learning my routine. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not okay,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making me afraid to live here.‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that,‚Äù he said, almost pleading. ‚ÄúThe woods‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all I have. I don‚Äôt know how else to live.‚ÄùI should‚Äôve been furious, but his words softened something in me. He wasn‚Äôt stealing for fun‚Äîhe was surviving. I took a deep breath, the bat still in my hands but lower now. ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt want to hurt you, and I don‚Äôt think you want to hurt me. But this has to stop. What if I leave food for you? Outside, so you don‚Äôt need to break in?‚ÄùHis eyes widened, like the idea was foreign. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd do that? For me?‚Äù‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, my voice steadier. ‚ÄúBut only if you promise to stop coming inside. Deal?‚ÄùHe hesitated, then nodded. ‚ÄúDeal.‚ÄùI pointed to the door. ‚ÄúGo. I‚Äôll leave a box on the porch tomorrow. Food, maybe some clothes. But don‚Äôt come back in here.‚ÄùHe set the soup can on the counter, slow and careful, and backed toward the door. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he whispered, then slipped out into the night, as quiet as he‚Äôd come. I rushed to lock the door, my hands still trembling, and sank onto the couch, the bat clattering to the floor.The next morning, I left a cardboard box on the porch‚Äîcanned beans, tuna, a loaf of bread, and an old sweater I didn‚Äôt wear anymore. By dawn, it was gone. I started doing it every week, leaving food and sometimes a blanket or socks. The break-ins stopped. Once, as I set out the box, I thought I heard a faint ‚Äúthank you‚Äù carried by the wind, but when I looked into the trees, there was nothing but shadows.I never saw him again, but the fear never fully left. Every creak of the cabin, every snap of a twig outside, made me wonder if he was still out there, watching. I kept the bat by my bed, checked the locks twice a night. The woods, once my escape, now felt alive with secrets. I stayed, though, determined to make my life here work. But I never forgot that night, or the man who lived like a ghost, surviving on the edges of my world.

  


# ""Not Alone in the Wild"":

I‚Äôd been living in my cabin for nearly seven months, tucked deep in a forest where the nearest town was a 40-minute drive down a winding dirt road. I‚Äôd wanted this‚Äîsolitude, a break from the noise of city life. The cabin was small, with weathered wooden walls, a slanted roof, and a stone chimney that puffed smoke when I lit the fire. My days were simple: tending a vegetable garden, chopping firewood, hauling water from a nearby stream. I‚Äôd built a routine, found comfort in the rhythm. The place felt like mine, until it didn‚Äôt.It started with little things. One morning, I noticed footprints in the soft dirt around the cabin. They were big, heavy boots, circling the house, stopping near the windows. I told myself it was a lost hiker, maybe someone curious. But the prints showed up again the next day, and the day after, always in a loop, like someone was studying the place. I‚Äôd stand on my porch, scanning the trees, but the forest was thick, swallowing any sign of who was out there. My stomach started to knot every time I stepped outside.Then my shovel went missing. I kept my tools in a small shed out back, locked with a rusty padlock. I searched everywhere, thinking I‚Äôd left it in the garden, but it was gone. A few days later, my hatchet disappeared too. I started to feel eyes on me, even in broad daylight. At night, things got worse. I‚Äôd hear noises‚Äîcrunching leaves, slow, deliberate steps outside. I‚Äôd lie in bed, heart thumping, telling myself it was deer or a fox. But the steps had a rhythm, too careful, too human.One afternoon, a man showed up. I was splitting wood when I saw him emerge from the trees, walking toward the cabin. He was skinny, with greasy brown hair and a stained jacket that hung loose on his frame. His eyes darted around, hands fidgeting in his pockets. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he called, stopping a few yards away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tom. Live a few miles out. You got any copper? Need it for my daughters, some school thing.‚ÄùHis story didn‚Äôt sit right. His voice was shaky, and he wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes. I gripped the axe a little tighter, keeping my distance. ‚ÄúNo copper,‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúGot some old car batteries in the shed, though. You can take those.‚Äù His face twitched, a quick flash of something‚Äîexcitement, maybe, or something darker. He nodded, waited while I grabbed two dusty batteries from the shed, and took them without a thank you. As he walked back into the woods, I memorized his face, the way he moved, the way he glanced back at the cabin.That night, the noises were louder. Crunching gravel, a faint scrape near the back door. I grabbed my flashlight, hands trembling, and checked every window. Nothing but darkness. I barely slept, my mind replaying Tom‚Äôs visit. The next morning, I found pry marks on the back door‚Äôs frame, deep scratches in the wood like someone had tried to force a crowbar through. My chest tightened. I started locking everything‚Äîdoors, windows, even the shed. I dug out my old shotgun from a trunk, cleaned it, loaded it, and kept it by the bed. I didn‚Äôt want to use it, but the thought of someone out there, watching, made my skin crawl.A few days later, I drove to see John, a neighbor who lived a few miles away. His place was bigger, with solar panels and a chain-link fence. He was older, maybe 60, with a gruff voice and calloused hands. We stood by his gate, sipping coffee he‚Äôd brewed on a camp stove. ‚ÄúYou look spooked,‚Äù he said, squinting at me.‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúFound footprints around my place, tools missing. Back door‚Äôs got pry marks. Met a guy, Tom, asking for copper. Seemed off.‚ÄùJohn‚Äôs face hardened. ‚ÄúTom? Never heard of him. Folks out here don‚Äôt just wander up asking for stuff. You gotta be careful. We‚Äôre too far from town for quick help. Get some motion lights, maybe a satellite phone. Check your place every day.‚Äù He paused, then added, ‚ÄúWe watch out for each other. You need me, you call.‚ÄùHis words helped, but the fear didn‚Äôt leave. Back home, I checked the cabin twice a day, looking for new footprints, more pry marks. I found a few‚Äîfaint scratches on a window latch, like someone tested it. I started sleeping in fits, waking at every sound. One night, around 1 a.m., I heard it‚Äîa creak, not outside, but inside the cabin. My heart stopped. I lay still, ears straining. Another creak, then a soft shuffle, coming from the living room.I grabbed the shotgun, my hands slick with sweat, and slipped out of bed. The floor was cold under my bare feet. I moved slowly, avoiding the boards I knew squeaked. In the living room, moonlight spilled through the window, and there he was‚ÄîTom, hunched over my desk, rifling through drawers. Papers were scattered, my flashlight knocked to the floor, its beam cutting across the room. He was muttering to himself, low and frantic, pulling out anything metal‚Äîa screwdriver, a small knife, even a spoon.I stepped forward, the floor creaking under me. His head whipped up, eyes wide, glinting in the dark. For a second, we just stared, my pulse hammering in my ears. ‚ÄúGet out,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking but loud, raising the shotgun. ‚ÄúNow.‚ÄùHe froze, hands half-raised, a screwdriver still clutched in one. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt gonna hurt you,‚Äù he stammered, voice high. ‚ÄúJust needed stuff. For my girls.‚Äù‚ÄúOut!‚Äù I shouted, stepping closer, the gun steady now. He stumbled back, eyes locked on the barrel, then turned and bolted for the back door. He fumbled with the lock, cursing under his breath, before yanking it open and sprinting into the night. I ran to the door, slamming it shut and bolting it, my hands trembling so bad I dropped the key. I stood there, listening to his footsteps fade, the forest swallowing him.I didn‚Äôt sleep after that. I checked every inch of the cabin, found the window he‚Äôd gotten in through‚Äîone I‚Äôd forgotten to lock, the latch bent open. He‚Äôd left a trail of dirt, a few papers crumpled on the floor. My stomach churned at how close he‚Äôd been, how long he might‚Äôve been inside while I slept. At first light, I called John. He came over, his truck rattling up the path. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky,‚Äù he said, inspecting the window. ‚ÄúCould‚Äôve been worse. You did good, standing your ground.‚Äù‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt feel good,‚Äù I said, my voice tight. ‚ÄúWhat if he comes back?‚Äù‚ÄúHe might,‚Äù John said plainly. ‚ÄúGet lights, cameras, something to call for help. We‚Äôll keep watch too. You‚Äôre not alone out here.‚ÄùThe next week, I poured everything into securing the place. I installed motion-sensor lights that flooded the yard with a harsh glow. I bought a cheap security camera, set it up to record the porch. I got a satellite phone, kept it charged by my bed. I started visiting John and other neighbors more, trading eggs from my chickens for their advice or spare tools. They told stories‚Äîothers who‚Äôd had intruders, people drawn to cabins like mine, thinking we‚Äôre easy targets. One guy had a truck stolen; another found a stranger sleeping in his shed. It wasn‚Äôt just me.I still live here, but it‚Äôs different now. The forest doesn‚Äôt feel like a refuge anymore. Every rustle, every snap of a twig, makes my heart race. I check the camera footage daily, scan for footprints, lock everything twice. The shotgun stays loaded, leaning by the door. I wanted freedom out here, a life on my terms, but I learned the truth: out in the wild, you‚Äôre never as alone as you think. Someone‚Äôs always watching, waiting for you to slip.",1,1749273064.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1l5cy2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1l5cy2n/perfectionism_work/,Perfectionism & Work,"Hello! 
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with OCD since 2019, and most of my compulsions revolve around checking and rumination. My OCD kicks into high gear surrounding my work performance, which is technically a blessing, but feels like an absolute curse. For example, I worked at an ice cream shop in college, and would have anxiety every day I worked and the day after. I would constantly check the Yelp reviews for the shop I worked at, worried that someone left a bad review about me. Once, I pulled a hair off of an ice cream cup and was worried that a customer saw it and ended up convincing myself that I would end up being reported to the health inspector because the customer would report it (the customer was about 12, for reference). It‚Äôs funny to look back on, but felt so real in the moment. It got to the point where I would go nonverbal with anxiety for an hour before each of my shifts, all for a minimum wage job scooping ice cream. 

Then, I became a teacher. I moved on from checking Yelp reviews to checking my email up to 17 times a night. I was worried that a parent would email me and be upset about something. I deleted the email app off of my phone and started making it as inconvenient as possible to check my email, but I always found a way around it. I‚Äôd try so hard to resist, but the relief of knowing that there was no email was too tempting. If anything went wrong throughout the school day, I‚Äôd be extremely anxious the remainder of the night, sure that I‚Äôd receive a scathing email. Even on days when things went perfectly at school, I would check my email with anxiety, afraid something had happened that I wasn‚Äôt aware of. On the few occasions that I did receive an email, I wouldn‚Äôt be calm until the matter was entirely resolved, and I‚Äôd always blame myself for whatever happened. 

Now, I got out of teaching after only 4 years, and have moved on to owning my own coffee shop with my partner. We‚Äôve recently gone sort of ‚Äúviral,‚Äù and have had a lot of traffic. I am back down the path of checking the reviews, except now I‚Äôm even more stressed about it due to it being such a personal thing for me. In addition to checking reviews, I now also have the lovely review culture created on tiktok and instagram. We‚Äôve had mostly positive feedback, but those don‚Äôt even matter to my brain. However, the few negative reviews effectively ruined the remainder of that day. I convince myself that the positive reviews are just doing us a courtesy, and the negative reviews are the absolute truth. After each day, instead of feeling proud and successful, and despite people frequently telling us that they love their drinks, I am left with pure stress and sadness at the idea of a bad review. I end each day emotionally drained and feeling unlike myself, which is a feeling I was excited to leave behind with teaching. I have essentially banned myself from watching TikToks about our shop and from reading comments on the viral video, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just being avoidant. 

I try to explain my feelings to my loved ones and they do their best, but it‚Äôs so isolating because they don‚Äôt actually get it. They tell me things I already technically know, such as, ‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre doing your best, don‚Äôt worry about others,‚Äù or ‚Äúonly pay attention to what you can control,‚Äù but they can never relate to the emotions I have. I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm looking for. Advice, community, anything, really. I just needed to talk to someone. ",1,1749272804.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

First 3 days were hell after wich i figured out how to deal with the symptoms i had, and its working so nice that im basically left with just 1 symptom wich i managed to reduce but not compleetly make it go away.

My body aches like hell and so hard that i couldnt get out of bed, sollution : Paracetamol 3 times a day, once i took it in 30 minutes all my pain was gone, pooffed away, i feel 0 body aches for a good 5h after wich i have to take anoather one, i take 1 in the morning, 1 in the afternoor and 1 in the evening. Only issue i have is that today i woke up due to aches at 3 in the morning and i had to take anoather one to fall asleep.

  
Anxiety , restlessness, akatasia , the doctor just gave me 1-0-1 Atvian , 1mg/dose , i instead chose to take 1-1-0 cus its awfull when the effects wore off, but Atvian unfortunately dosent get rid of my restlesness, i would still couldnt find a comfortable possition when in the bed trying to take a nap or in the chair trying to play a game, i would feel like im about to lose my mind , so i ordered L-Theanine online, took 1 scoop of 200mg and it instantly calmed me and improved my mood, and i mean calm calm, i have 0 anxiety , 0 restlessness, and 0 akatasia, i am fully functional, i even drank coffee and played some videogames for hours on end with no symptoms, wich is awesome, i take L-theanine 3 times a day 1-1-1, and if i wake up in the night with restlessness i take anoather scoop. This probably wont work for a long time so i will have to up my dosage, but i think ill be ok 1 week, and after that will have to go up with the dosage.

  
  
Motivation, depression, low mood, no energy, i ordered L-tyrosine wich is a precursor to dopamine, i take 1 big scoop in the morning aprox 4-5g of it on an empty stomach, and it lifts me up, gives me a big boost of energy and motivation wich i need to do things and be functional. Because i also take theanine and atvian , i dont experience anxiety or restlessness from it.

  
The only issue i have is brain zaps wich make me a little dizzy, but when im playing a game i kinda forget they are happening and time just flies by.

So this is my cold turkey with close to 0 downsides. I feel normal + brainzaps.

( I Have to mention that i already am on Lamotrigene 100 mg , olanzapine 15mg and bupropion 150mg for quite some time, but i still was unfunctional untill i did what i did.)

Posting this so that hopefully helps others who wanna quit cold turkey this medication. Also maybe have a chill game to play to pass time. Gl yall!",0,1749272656.0,antidepressants,1,0.5,False

I dated this girl for 8 months, 27M 30F. I have always felt like an old soul, I have only ever dated twice in my entire life. This one seemed to be one of the safest places we have ever been in. We met at an event at a park and grew into each other. I love the slow burns. I get to know someones values dealbreakers etc. Ours became serious, we even spoke about spending habits, thoughts about what cheating meant to us, and attitudes towards building a family together. We spoke about how our ages impacted how we related to one another given that she is older than I. 
We had fun this pasy weekend, we visited a local museum and had coffee later in the day and took her back home where she expressed how glad she was to have me. During the week, she sent me screenshots of our initial texts of which I found really cute ‚Äúroad to 1 year‚Äù. We work close to each other and I always work from home and go to the office when needed, and I always see her thereafter, take a walk have a snack and I head back. This time she got me socksüòÇ with a cute note inside. The day after was weird. But I thought she was just busy with work. The texting was slightly aloof and i thought perhaps its just a busy day for her at work. I gave her a the usual sweet goodnight message and just waited for the next day to talk to her. 
Friday morning? I receive a message‚Ä¶‚ÄùLets break up..‚Äù the reason? She is not able to bear the age and cultural differences that we have. Thats it!! I called her to hear her out, i thought i was dreaming still. She said, she doesn‚Äôt feel ready to fight for us. That she would rather bear the pain of a breakup now than later get us rejected by one of the parents..again based on assumptions that people of my culture have a weird way of treating women(we were born in the same country and are both citizens of the same country). I was trying to fight for a solution for us..but this didn‚Äôt work. I felt that its better not to beg, not to force and not to try and convince especially when someone has already made a decision. I absolutely hate the fact that during the week everything is fine and a bomb just hits you suddenly that its over. I don‚Äôt know who will read this, i am not sure if I am seeking validation, all I know is that I am more angry and confused than sad. We spoke about our different cultures, and we said that we can never know and only first impressions would go a long way. We were both on the same page that it is not a matter of urgency to meet her parents. That it would come later as the relationship continued to grow. Suddenly she is not ready for a future where our families are involved. Most painful part? Not sure that I will stand with her when the challenges come. If anything, I have tried to be supportive in her other areas of life. Coming through financially and giving emotional support when needed. I am just so angry.

The consumer affairs landscape on June 6, 2025, presented a mixed bag, marked by significant fluctuations in the stock market, particularly within the Indian context, and a pivotal legal setback for Apple regarding its App Store payment policies. The day witnessed developments spanning corporate governance concerns, legal challenges, and the performance of key players in various consumer sectors.

**Stock Market Fluctuations in India:**

Several prominent companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) experienced price fluctuations, providing a snapshot of investor sentiment and economic performance. These included:

*   **Tata Consumer Products:** Trading in the Tea & Coffee sector, Tata Consumer Products closed at ‚Çπ1115.7, reflecting a slight 0.4% increase on the day, though it had experienced a negative return of -3.39% in the past month and 16.47% in the last three months. The daily pivot level was set at ‚Çπ1112.82, indicating a key technical indicator for traders.
*   **Hindustan Unilever:**  Operating in the Personal Care sector, Hindustan Unilever closed at ‚Çπ2388 and ‚Çπ2387.4 in two separate reports, showing a small 0.33% and 0.46% daily gain.  Despite these daily gains, it has performed moderately in the last month (0.15% and 0.28% gain) and the last three months (7.45% and 7.59% gain). Its daily pivot level was set at ‚Çπ2380.3, with resistance levels at R1=2389.85, R2=2396.55, and R3=2406.1, highlighting potential barriers to upward price movement.
*   **Britannia Industries:**  This Food Processing & Packaging sector company saw a -0.52% decline in its share price, closing at ‚Çπ5584.  It had performed well over the last month (3.35% gain) and the last three months (18.38% gain). The daily pivot level was ‚Çπ5624.6.
*   **Titan Company:** In the Gems, Jewellery & Precious Metals sector, Titan Company's stock closed at ‚Çπ3559.05, up 1.51% for the day.  The stock demonstrated strong growth over the past month (7.84% gain) and three months (13.88% gain). Its daily pivot level was ‚Çπ3503.95.
*   **Asian Paints:** The Paints/Varnishes sector saw Asian Paints close at ‚Çπ2244.75, with a negligible daily change of 0.03%. The stock experienced a drop over the last month (-7.19%) and three months (-1.01%), reflecting a cautious market sentiment for this sector. Its daily pivot level was set at ‚Çπ2247.83, with resistance levels at R1=2255.22, R2=2265.68, and R3=2273.07.
*   **ITC:** The Cigarettes & Tobacco Products sector saw ITC close at ‚Çπ420.85, up 0.32% for the day. The stock showed negative growth in the last month (-3.44%) and a small increase in the last three months (3.67%). Its daily pivot level was ‚Çπ420.18, with resistance levels at R1=420.82, R2=421.63, and R3=422.27.

These fluctuations highlight the dynamic nature of the Indian stock market and its sensitivity to various economic factors.  The mixed performance of the companies reflects differing investor confidence levels across various sectors.

**Vijay Mallya Loan Recovery Controversy:**

Adding to the day's news was a renewed discussion regarding the controversial figure of Vijay Mallya, former owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) cricket team, and his substantial loan defaults. The debate was sparked by an X (formerly Twitter) post from RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka, who questioned the continued demonization of Mallya, especially considering reports of loan recoveries. Goenka's remarks suggested that Mallya's case was being unfairly singled out when compared to other defaulters who had caused larger losses to banks. Mallya himself responded, criticizing what he termed ""blatant discrimination."" The situation underscores ongoing concerns about corporate accountability and the uneven application of legal scrutiny in cases of financial fraud in India. The context of this discussion is that Mallya owes 6,203 crore debt.

**Apple's App Store Legal Setback:**

In a significant legal development, a court denied Apple's request to stay a ruling regarding its App Store payment policies. The ruling dictates that Apple must permit developers to direct users to alternative payment methods outside of the App Store. The court, after reviewing the relevant factors, did not find a basis to justify a stay. This decision has far-reaching implications for Apple's revenue model, potentially leading to a decline in the fees it collects from developers. The court stated, ‚ÄúApple ‚Äòbears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of [our] discretion,‚Äô‚Äù and then concluded a stay was not appropriate. This development represents a victory for developers seeking more flexibility in how they process payments and could encourage greater competition within the mobile app ecosystem.

1l5clab,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1l5clab/howard_is_the_most_wronged_character_in_the_series/,Howard is the most wronged character in the series,"Rewatching Better Call Saul now for the second time, I had a completely different experience than the first. At first, my focus was entirely on the characters directly linked to Breaking Bad ‚Äî Lalo, Nacho, Hector, Gus, Mike... and of course, the arc of Jimmy becoming Saul Goodman. All of this is still genius. But this time, more calmly, paying attention to the details, the one who caught my attention the most was precisely the one I had ignored the most the previous time: Howard Hamlin.

Seriously, Howard is probably the most wronged character in the entire series. And I don't just say that because of the ending ‚Äî but for the entire journey.

Right from the start, the series introduces you to him as that arrogant lawyer, with expensive suits, impeccable hair, that starched manner of someone who seems to think he's in his own right. But watching carefully, I began to realize that Howard was never the villain that the series made him out to be at the beginning. In fact, he's a guy who was forced to live a life he didn't want.

There's a line from him, in the first seasons, in which he mentions that he never wanted to be a lawyer. That the one who forced him to do this was his father ‚Äî the other ""H"" in HHM. And that says it all. The guy grew up suffocated by expectations, forced to follow a path he didn't choose. And yet, he did it in the most correct way possible.

You realize how emotionally stuck he is. He tries to be impeccable all the time ‚Äî hair, clothes, posture ‚Äî because it's the only way he knows how to survive in this world where he's always had to fit in. He probably had an authoritarian father, and was later ‚Äúadopted‚Äù emotionally by Charles McGill, who was also manipulative and narcissistic. Charles used Howard as a puppet. Jimmy wanted to join HHM, Charles was the one who stopped him, but Howard was the one who took the blame. Once again, him being used.

And even so, Howard never descended to the level of others. I tried to maintain ethics and elegance. When he decides to face Jimmy, he goes to the boxing ring ‚Äî because even to get revenge, he wanted to do everything right. He hires a detective to protect himself... and is deceived. Jimmy sets everything up to make it look like Howard is using cocaine and being paranoid. And the worst part: it works. He loses millionaire clients, loses his wife's respect (that scene with the coffee that he makes with affection and she throws it into the cup with contempt is heartbreaking), loses everything.

He still goes to therapy. Try to open up. And even then it is ignored. The guy tries to heal, tries to understand himself, and the series shows this with great subtlety. But nobody listens to Howard.

In the end, he will get satisfaction from Jimmy and Kim ‚Äî and takes a shot at Lalo Salamanca's head, completely out of context, in the middle of a situation he shouldn't even be in. He was literally the scapegoat for everything.

And what bothers me most: even when he was teased, he was humiliated for no reason. Jimmy wearing suits similar to his, putting Howard's name in the trash, the way everyone treats him as if he were a villain... whereas, coldly, Howard was the most upstanding guy there.

Jimmy, Kim, Mike, Nacho, everyone played the game. Howard wasn't playing. And for that reason, he was the one who got screwed the most. He was the only ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù in a world of manipulators, criminals and survivors. And it cost him his life.

Reviewing the series with this perspective changed everything for me. Howard's tragedy is silent, but it is perhaps the cruelest of all.

Did anyone else have this perception the second time they watched the series?",11,1749271514.0,betterCallSaul,0,0.79,False

We are starting a free men's workout group that is going to start meeting up on Saturday mornings 6:3a-7:30a and Wednesday mornings 5:30a-6:15a.

We are open to ALL men - with kids or without, married or single, in good shape or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter. We are nondenominational and not affiliated with any particular religion, church, or political party.

Workouts are always FREE, so leave your wallets at home... no payments, no subscriptions, no trials, no memberships, no joining fees. No commitment whatsoever. Absolutely no catch, I promise. After the workout we head for coffee (optional), and it‚Äôs our tradition to pay for your coffee if it's your first time out with us.

If you are interested in working out with us, just be at Genoveva Chavez Community Center for a 6:30am kickoff on Saturday. We meet at 6:30 on the dot, so plan accordingly. I recommend a few minutes early so you can warm up and stretch. We will meet at the park in front. We are also meeting at Fort Marcy Park (meet at the fields, park on Artists Rd.) on Wednesday mornings 5:30-6:15.

We are a local chapter of F3 (fitness, fellowship, and faith) which has groups all across the USA. We are a new F3 region (we just launched last Wednesday) and only the second in NM (Albuquerque has a great group)!

I first joined an F3 group in San Diego and I can‚Äôt even began to describe what a positive impact it has made in my life. If you need help being held accountable with fitness goals, this is the perfect way. 

The fellowship aspect is an amazing way to build community and socialize outside of the workout space. Whether it be getting the kids together, big family outings or just the guys, fellowship is hugely important and this is a great way to find that. The group I was a part of routinely planned meal trains for those who needed help (babies on the way or spouses who had major surgery), checked in on guys who hadn‚Äôt come around in awhile and just genuinely cared about the well-being of each other. 

I will admit I was a little put off by the faith aspect when I went to my first workout. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect and worried I would be preached to or had something pushed on me. It was anything but that. The faith piece refers to a faith in something higher than ourselves. For some that‚Äôs a religious faith/purpose, but for others it‚Äôs the idea that we are meant to serve a higher purpose in our lives/community (ie a belief in a higher common good outside of oneself, sense of calling to serve and help our community, community service projects, etc.).

I‚Äôm so excited to bring this to Santa Fe and share this with others. Hope to see y‚Äôall gents out there! You can check out f3santafe.com for more info (although I am still working on getting info up on there) or dm/email me and I would be happy to answer any questions.",1,1749271205.0,SantaFe,0,0.6,False

I realize this is a common question, but I'm having a hard time deciding the best place for us to stay on our honeymoon. We've never been to Hawaii before and are planning a \~7 night trip in January where we will rent a car. 

We've never done a beach/tropical trip before, usually go to mountain towns and do a lot of outdoor recreation or European cities. We are looking forward to:

* snorkeling / swimming / water activities
* seeing the whales and other nature things (turtles!!)
* walking around, taking it in, buying little treats or coffees, etc. 
* exploring different parts of the island, hiking, etc. 
* relaxing (more my partner's energy than mine - I tend to be restless and pretty active. I can't really imagine laying at the beach or the pool for more than a little bit at a time but he is a big reader)

I've done a lot of research into the different options. While we will have a car for excursions, I really value walkability - love walking to get something to eat or just taking it in! We like eating out and are vegetarians - we expect to cook some at a condo style place and like eating anywhere from food truck to nice restaurants (but not what we are going to Maui for). 

  
**Ka'anapali** seems like a good fit because of the whales, walkability, and the ability to get an ocean view from our unit. My coworker insists we won't like it, it will be too rainy, too far from the rest of the island, and too commercial with the resorts. I'm a little hesitant it will be too far from other places we want to go. 

**Kihei** seems a little too everyday for our honeymoon, it doesn't seem as pleasant for walking around (??), but I like that it is close to everything. 

**Wailea** seems too luxe and just not our vibe - we like nice places but just doesn't seem like the best fit?

**Kapalua** seems really nice - beautiful area and more relaxed than Ka'anapli while not quite a Wailea but it seems pretty far away from the rest of the island. Is it less walkable than Ka'anapali? Is it too stormy in January?

  
Any tips or advice or places you think would be best? I assume I'm having a hard time deciding because they will all be nice so harder to differentiate :) ",4,1749270589.0,MauiVisitors,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the most sought-after laptop tote bags for women in 2025 are defined by their carefully considered features, each contributing to a blend of style, security, and utility.

**Dedicated Laptop compartment:** A padded and secure laptop compartment is paramount. Look for compartments that fit laptops up to 15.6 inches, with extra cushioning to protect against bumps and drops. Many bags include a Velcro strap or zipper enclosure to keep the laptop from shifting during transport. The dimensions of these compartments often range from 14 inches wide to 10 inches high, providing ample space while ensuring a snug fit.

**Durable and water-Resistant Materials:** The bag's material is crucial for longevity and protection. Popular choices include high-quality canvas,nylon,and faux leather,each offering varying degrees of water resistance. Reinforcements at stress points, such as the handles and seams, are key to ensuring the bag can withstand daily wear and tear. the denier count (a measure of fabric thickness) is a good indicator of durability, with higher numbers signifying greater strength and resistance to tearing.

**Multiple Interior and Exterior Pockets:** Organization is essential in a laptop tote. Multiple interior pockets, including zippered compartments, slip pockets, and pen holders, help keep your belongings organized. Exterior pockets, such as a fast-access phone pocket or a water bottle holder, add convenience. the number and size of these pockets vary, with some bags offering as many as 10 separate compartments to accommodate everything from chargers to makeup.

**Reinforced Handles and Straps:** The handles and straps are critical for comfortable carrying. Look for sturdy, reinforced stitching and durable materials like leather or nylon webbing. Wider straps distribute weight more evenly,reducing shoulder strain,especially when carrying a heavy laptop and other essentials. Some bags also offer adjustable or removable shoulder straps for added versatility. Drop lengths on handles typically range between 9 and 12 inches to accommodate carrying over your shoulder or in your hand.

Key features of the best laptop tote bags include:

* Secure laptop compartment
* Durable construction
* Ample organizational pockets
* Comfortable carrying options

## FAQs Section

**Is the tote bag water-resistant enough to protect my laptop in light rain?**
Many laptop tote bags utilize water-resistant materials like nylon or treated canvas, which offer decent protection against light rain. However, for heavier downpours, it is advisable to consider bags with explicitly waterproof coatings or use a separate rain cover for maximum protection. Check the product description for details on water resistance ratings.

**What laptop size can the tote bag accommodate?**
Most laptop tote bags specify the maximum laptop size they can comfortably hold, generally ranging from 13-inch to 16-inch laptops. Always measure your laptop's dimensions (including the bezel) and compare them to the bag's internal laptop compartment measurements to ensure a proper fit. It's also a good idea to read customer reviews to get a sense of how well the bag accommodates different laptop models.**Are the shoulder straps adjustable or padded for comfortable carrying?**
Adjustable and padded shoulder straps are crucial for comfort, especially when carrying heavy laptops and other essentials. Check the product description to confirm whether the straps are adjustable and if they feature padding to reduce shoulder strain. Some bags also include removable shoulder straps, offering the option to carry the bag by its handles for a more formal look.

1l5c7u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1l5c7u8/suddenly_a_nonsmoker/,Suddenly a non-smoker.,"I‚Äôve been a social smoker for most of my adult life. Recently, I started smoking a little more than usual, such as during the day, with my daily coffee, with friends, even into my MJ journey. 

However, 6 months in, I woke up one morning two weeks ago, and quite suddenly and unexpectedly I did not feel like smoking any more. 

Like, not a single craving. Actually, the thought of it right now is making me feel ill. A friend even offered me one last week and I said no. Something I‚Äôve not been able to do for a very long time. 

I‚Äôve read that MJ can have this effect, just wondering why it‚Äôs taken 6 months for it to happen (if it‚Äôs even MJ at all). I‚Äôm currently on my third 10mg pen. 

Anyone else share a similar experience? I‚Äôm curious. ",12,1749270164.0,Mounjaro,3,0.93,False
1l5c7p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1l5c7p4/tomt_help_finding_video_of_overly_friendly_guy/,[TOMT] Help finding video of overly friendly guy,"i saw this video on instagram within the last few months and saved it but it seems to have disappeared

two guys filming on their phone start talking to this guy who's presumably paying for his parking on the street. the guy is dressed nicely in a plaid button down with either jeans or khakis, can't remember. he was holding a coffee and had brown hair and some facial hair

he had this very extroverted personality that seemed almost threatening. many in the comments described him as ""someone who isn't allowed to talk about work and has most certainly has killed someone""

he asked them their names and where they're from. they mentioned russia and then they ask him his thoughts on the 
comparing russia to ukraine. he was able to deflect rather smoothly and without confrontation. 


during the entire conversation he is well spoken, upbeat, and barely breaks out of a smile. 

in the background his friend, presumably, is adjusting something in the backseat and has a irritated and slightly concerned look in his face

after that the video ended. i checked the page and it seems as if their entire premise is to film people in public to get a rise.

1l5c7h4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5c7h4,Coffee and Contemplation,"David Harbor, has said the hopes that his character (Jim Hopper) gets a happy end to his story, that he deserves it after all of the pain he has been through including being a Vietnam Veteran, the passing of his daughter, fighting a human terminator, being a Russian prisoner. And the most dangerous the countless, triple eggo extravaganzas with Eleven. 

As one of my personal favorite characters I hope he and Joyce have a happily ever after.

What do you hope for Hopper in season 5, will he live, and will he the satisfying conclusion he deserves? ",6,1749270127.0,StrangerThings,1,1.0,False
