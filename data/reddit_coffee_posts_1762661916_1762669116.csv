1osbz3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1osbz3p/best_vpns_for_iceland/,Best VPNs for Iceland,"Iceland may be known for its strong privacy laws and world-class internet infrastructure, but even in this digitally advanced nation, online security challenges persist. Whether you're an Icelander protecting your data from mandatory ISP logging, a tourist navigating public WiFi at the Blue Lagoon, or an expat accessing Icelandic content abroad, a reliable VPN is essential.

After extensive testing and research into Iceland's unique digital landscape, we've identified the best VPNs that address the country's specific cybersecurity needs. This guide will help you understand why VPN protection matters in Iceland and which services deliver the security, speed, and streaming capabilities you need.

# Why You Need a VPN in Iceland

Despite Iceland's reputation as a privacy-friendly nation, several factors make VPN protection essential for residents and visitors alike.

# ISP Data Retention Requirements

While Iceland implements strong GDPR protections, the country's Electronic Communications Act requires **ISPs to collect and store user data for up to 6 months**. This means your internet provider is legally obligated to log your connection times, bandwidth usage, and potentially browsing activities—regardless of Iceland's otherwise progressive privacy stance.

A VPN encrypts your traffic and routes it through secure servers, preventing ISPs from monitoring your online activities beyond basic connection metadata.

# Third-Party Five Eyes Contributor Status

Iceland serves as a third-party contributor to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, despite not being a full member. This relationship means that under certain circumstances, Icelandic authorities may cooperate with international surveillance networks.

For privacy-conscious individuals, this creates a compelling reason to use encryption tools that prevent any third party—domestic or international—from accessing your communications.

# Growing Cyber Threats Targeting Iceland

Iceland experienced its **largest recorded cyberattack in 2018** when thousands of residents—a significant percentage of the 350,000 population—were targeted by a sophisticated phishing campaign using Remcos RAT (Remote Access Tool). The attack specifically targeted Iceland's banking system, demonstrating that cybercriminals understand the country's digital infrastructure well enough to craft effective attacks.

More recent threats include:

* **Ransomware attacks** increasingly targeting businesses, media outlets, and government agencies
* **Credential theft campaigns** exploiting Iceland's advanced digital economy
* **Attacks on critical infrastructure**, including the 2024 assault on [mbl.is](http://mbl.is), one of Iceland's major news portals
* **NTLM relay attacks** targeting the country's business sector

With Iceland's cybersecurity market projected to grow 12.58% annually through 2029, the threat landscape continues to evolve alongside the country's digital transformation.

# Public WiFi Security Risks

Iceland's tourism industry welcomes over 2 million visitors annually—nearly six times the resident population. While free WiFi is widely available throughout Reykjavik's cafés, restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, these networks pose significant security risks:

* **Unencrypted connections** allow hackers to intercept banking credentials, passwords, and personal data
* **Fake hotspots** mimicking legitimate networks can steal information from unsuspecting users
* **Limited security in rural areas** where travelers depend on hotel WiFi for navigation and emergency communication
* **43% of free WiFi users have experienced security breaches**, according to Forbes research

A VPN encrypts your connection on any network, transforming vulnerable public WiFi into a secure communication channel.

# Streaming and Content Access

Iceland's Netflix library contains significantly fewer titles than larger markets like the US. Icelandic travelers abroad also face challenges accessing:

* **Local services** including RÚV, Stöð 2, and Nova TV
* **US-exclusive platforms** like Hulu and Paramount+
* **Banking and government services** restricted to Icelandic IP addresses
* **International streaming libraries** with different content selections

A quality VPN with servers in both Iceland and target countries enables seamless access to content regardless of your physical location.

# What Makes a VPN Ideal for Iceland

Not every VPN service meets Iceland's unique requirements. Based on extensive testing across Iceland's digital infrastructure, these factors determine VPN effectiveness:

# Server Presence in Iceland

Physical servers in Reykjavik or Akureyri provide **low-latency connections** essential for:

* Accessing Icelandic services while traveling abroad
* Maintaining fast speeds for domestic use
* Bypassing geo-restrictions on local content

# International Server Network

Iceland's compact size makes global connectivity crucial. A robust international network enables:

* Access to streaming services worldwide
* Fast connections when traveling
* Alternative routes if specific servers face congestion

# Strong Security Standards

Iceland's evolving threat landscape demands comprehensive protection:

* **AES-256 encryption** (military-grade standard)
* **Audited no-logs policies** verified by independent firms like PwC or Deloitte
* **Kill switch protection** to prevent data leaks if VPN connection drops
* **DNS leak protection** ensuring all traffic remains encrypted
* **Modern protocols** like WireGuard or NordLynx for speed and security

# High-Speed Performance

With Iceland ranking 6th globally for internet speeds at 297.5 Mbps average, your VPN shouldn't create a bottleneck. Look for services maintaining **at least 90% of baseline speeds** to preserve Iceland's world-class connectivity.

# Streaming Capabilities

Effective VPNs should reliably unblock:

* Icelandic platforms (RÚV, Stöð 2, Nova TV)
* International services (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer)
* US-exclusive content (Paramount+, Peacock, HBO Max)

# Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction

VPN headquarters location matters. Services based in Panama, British Virgin Islands, or other privacy-respecting jurisdictions face no mandatory data retention laws and resist government data requests more effectively than providers in surveillance alliance countries.

**Best VPNs for Iceland torrenting:**

* **NordVPN:** Dedicated P2P servers in Iceland
* **Private Internet Access:** Port forwarding support
* **Surfshark:** Unlimited bandwidth for large downloads

# Common VPN Questions for Iceland Users

# Is using a VPN legal in Iceland?

**Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Iceland.** The country's strong privacy protections and democratic values support citizens' rights to encrypt their communications and browse anonymously.

However, using VPN for illegal activities (copyright infringement, fraud, cybercrime) remains illegal regardless of encryption. VPN use should protect privacy, not facilitate criminal behavior.

# Will a VPN slow down Iceland's fast internet?

Iceland's average internet speed of 297.5 Mbps means most users won't notice VPN overhead. Quality providers maintain **90-95% of baseline speeds**:

* **Without VPN:** 300 Mbps typical
* **With quality VPN:** 270-285 Mbps
* **Performance impact:** Minimal for most activities

Modern protocols like WireGuard and NordLynx minimize speed loss while maintaining strong encryption.

# Can I use free VPNs in Iceland?

**Free VPNs are not recommended** for several critical reasons:

**Security risks:**

* 38% of free VPN apps contain malware (CSIRO study)
* Many sell browsing data to advertisers
* Weak encryption or no encryption at all
* No kill switch protection

**Performance limitations:**

* Severe speed restrictions (often under 2 Mbps)
* Data caps (typically 500 MB - 10 GB monthly)
* Overcrowded servers causing constant buffering
* Limited server locations

**Better alternatives:** Premium VPNs like Surfshark ($2.19/month) or NordVPN ($3.69/month) provide comprehensive protection for less than the cost of a coffee in Reykjavik.

# Which VPN is fastest for Iceland?

Based on extensive testing:

1. **ExpressVPN:** 95-98% speed retention (fastest overall)
2. **Surfshark:** 800+ Mbps on optimal servers
3. **NordVPN:** 92-95% speed retention (best balance of speed and security)

Speed varies based on server selection, time of day, and distance from server location.

# Do I need a VPN if I'm just visiting Iceland?

**Yes, tourists should use VPN in Iceland** for several reasons:

**Protection needs:**

* Public WiFi security at airports, hotels, tourist sites
* Safe access to online banking from abroad
* Protection against fake hotspots in crowded tourist areas
* Secure navigation and communication in rural areas

**Content access:**

* Streaming home country content (Netflix libraries, local news)
* Accessing banking and services restricted to home IP addresses
* Maintaining normal digital routines while traveling

**Setup before arrival:** Install and test VPN before departing for Iceland. Airport and hotel WiFi networks are most vulnerable to interception.

# Can VPN help me watch Icelandic TV abroad?

**Yes, connecting to Iceland VPN servers provides access to:**

* **RÚV:** National public broadcaster
* **Stöð 2:** Major commercial channel
* **Nova TV:** Entertainment programming
* **Icelandic news websites**
* **Streaming services with Icelandic content**

**Setup process:**

1. Connect to Reykjavik or Akureyri server
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Visit Icelandic streaming platform
4. Content appears as if accessing from within Iceland

# How does VPN interact with Iceland's data retention laws?

Iceland's Electronic Communications Act requires ISPs to log connection data for 6 months. **VPN encryption prevents meaningful data collection:**

**What ISPs can still see:**

* You're connecting to VPN server
* Connection timestamp
* Amount of data transferred
* VPN provider's IP address

**What ISPs cannot see:**

* Websites you visit
* Content you access
* Data you transmit
* Your actual online activities

The encrypted tunnel prevents ISPs from fulfilling the spirit of data retention requirements—they see only encrypted traffic, rendering the logs meaningless for surveillance purposes.

# Iceland's Cybersecurity Landscape: Why Protection Matters

As I drank my cappuccino, I thought about my life, looked at the expensive cars driving by, and wondered what I was doing wrong.

Then an expensive BMW X6 pulled up outside the cafe and an attractive, well-dressed man got out. 

He decided to have a coffee in the cafe and asked if he could sit with me. 

We started talking, and he told me about an idea for making money that he had seen in u/crowjudgement and that really works.",2,1762668852.0,10xPennyStocks,0,0.75,False

I have been friends with one of my roommates since first year, although we were living in different dorms.   
The past two academic years I've been living with said roommate and I get along 99% of the time and that 1% is generally over small and petty things.   
Anyways, I was looking for my instant coffee that I usually have on the counter/shelves. Couldn't find it this morning and ultimately didn't need it. Ok fine whatever. I found it after work and expressed that I was happy that I found it (different roommate put it on a different shelf). My roommate chimes in that ""caffeine is detrimental to society and it's capitalism's fault that we need to rely on caffeine as much as we do."" I understand the argument, but ultimately disagree. And was getting oddly defensive about it.   
Keep in mind that they are essentially against all drugs (to the extent that if you've ever consumed an alcoholic drink you're an alcoholic and a morally bad person and you can't be friends with them anymore, I wish that I was exaggerating), but still okay with drugs prescribed by a doctor (but probably on thin ice). Called me an addict over wanting to drink coffee on early mornings so that I could be more alert/focussed, especially when driving. I drink less than four cups of coffee a week. I'm happy that they don't need to rely on caffeine to stay safe and alert. 

I'm ultimately hurt by this because   
a) they've put me in a position where I can't have any of my friends over/around(that also were this roommate's friends) because they occasionally have a drink (think a glass a month)   
b) ignore the horrors of addictions and what that can entail (I went to a friend's funeral who likely passed from an OD, and this roommate basically told me ""not surprised"" and it took a lot not to lose my marbles). I recognize that they have seen a different aspect/perspective of addiction, but this comment was inappropriate.   
c) I work TWO jobs (in addition to volunteering, and other things here and there). 

And as much as I want to leave, I know what to expect from this roommate. If I move now, my options are incredibly limited and I don't know what kind of situation that I'm putting myself in.

Buckle up, this is a bit of a story. (TLDR at the bottom)

Today, as we were on our way to get our morning coffee for our lazy day, my girlfriend spotted something peaking out of the bushes at us. She identified it as a kitty almost immediately. (Shes good like that) we approached and this little one, without any fear, exited the bushes and started nuzzling and chatting with us asking for love and attention. As soon as I pet him, I could tell he has had a rough life. 

He was covered in sores and all manners of scratches quite literally over almost every inch of his body. He is the scraggliest, saddest little thing with more love to give than I have ever seen in any feral cat. We immediately got our cat’s kennel and scooped him up recognizing that he was in dire need of a vet. 

Almost a thousand dollars and several hours later, we have his flees taken care of, checked for a chip (no chip), found out he is 1 yrs old, missing a back molar, got him meds and the works. It seemed that the cat distribution system had apparently chosen us for our third and final cat and we could not have been more excited.

Until…

The vet came back almost in tears with the results of one of the tests. She really wanted this to work out for us as much as we did. This little man had FIV. Basically, kitty HIV as far as I understand it. With our two cats at home. We can’t keep him…the vet advised us that it can be spread to our cats via scratches and saliva. We checked with the humane society but they won’t take him either on account of the FIV. 

We don’t know what to do and it’s been a heartbreaking day. We even named him Salem in expectation of bringing him into the family. Now we need to find a place for him. One of the humane society people said that we should just put him back outside and we will not do that as it has been pouring the last few days and getting pretty cold.

Cat people of Reddit, we need your help. Is there a rescue or shelter for cats like Salem in the Portland or Vancouver area? Are there any people who can help that you know of?

He loves to give head nuzzles, crawls on your lap and just purrs and purrs. He will climb on your shoulder and will curl around your neck if you let him. He seems so full of love and we refuse to just casually toss him back outside but we can’t keep him in our apartment locked away from our other cats forever. We need solutions or at the very least, someone who wants a single loving cat who doesn’t already have cats in the Portland/vancouver area. Please help.

Since I’m 17, I had this one goal I wanted to achieve before turning 18 — running a full marathon. I don’t care about pace, I don’t care about how many pauses I take. I just wanted to hit the magical 42.195 km mark on my Strava app.

A few weeks ago, I actually made a plan where I would continuously increase my kilometers per session by 10% every Sunday. Sounded like a good plan, but I didn’t calculate that right. I ran a half marathon in Munich and a triathlon in Linz, and I got ill twice. Now here I am — after a two-week illness and one week until I turn 18. This is the last weekend I can achieve my goal. So it’s now or never.

I told everyone I met that I would run a marathon tomorrow (Saturday), so that my ego couldn’t back out. I loaded up on some carbs this evening to get ready for tomorrow.

I went to bed pretty early that Friday because I wanted to get up early. I couldn’t really sleep well. The alarm clock rang at 6 a.m., and I somehow managed to get up. I FELT TERRIBLE. After my normal morning routine (teeth brushing, hair styling, …) I made a coffee and read a book just to get myself ready for the run. I had already dressed in my sportswear right after getting up.

As I felt ready and the time hit 7 a.m., I started to run from home.

My plan was to choose small towns as checkpoints where I could also buy some food or drinks if I wanted. That went really well, and my thoughts were great. (I just thought about my whole life during the first few hours.) Two Red Bulls later I was at km 28, and things started to slow down a little bit. My legs felt heavier, and I couldn’t run faster than a 7:30 pace. It was insane. But at this point, I was still in flow, so it didn’t feel that bad.

Then the 35 km mark came, and I thought: only 7 km to go. BUT that was the time it really hit. My legs were extremely heavy. I wasn’t even able to run uphill or downhill because I was in such pain.

And then I started to calculate in my head: running with an 8:00 pace and I still need 7 km… fuck. I still need to run nearly a full hour. I couldn’t concentrate on anything other than my run because I was in such pain. I just kept repeating the same sentence over and over again: *now or never, now or never…*

Then the last 3 km came — and this was, I think, the worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life…

***But in the end…***

“*Yes, Rio, your dish sounds like a staple street food dish, or in Chef Ramsay’s case, tableside.*” *- Eileen Andrade*

***Rio’s dish clinched a challenge victory for the Red Team, and they were rewarded with a trip to Little Havana, while the Blue Team had to complete a punishment of separating ingredients and grinding spices for Cuban Night.***

***The Red Team hoped to plow through service without any injustice in their way. Though they were met with a few empanada issues…***

***JC’s poor attempts on Garnish…***

“*Look at it, the corn’s exploded into a measly puddle!*” */* “*Jose Christophe? Yeah, more like Just Clueless; that’s what your name should be.*” *- Ramsay*

***And Dani’s pork mishap.***

Ramsay would dismiss everyone from the dining room, and as everyone walked out, Tem would make a confessional, expressing relief that she isn’t on Ramsay’s list anymore, happy that she’s going to keep moving forward without any more issues. Meanwhile, Rio would make a confessional of how he’s going to miss JC; he and him seemed quite close when he was back on the Blue Team, but it’s a huge reminder that he really shouldn’t be fooling around, as he’d nearly gone home a few nights ago for being too happy in the middle of service. Everyone returned to the dorms, as Tem and Samuel lament on how they made the right decision, but at the same time, they felt JC was their little lightbulb that could take them anywhere. Though David does swing by and state that lightbulbs don’t last forever, and that even he knew that JC was close to failing; he’d back that up in a confessional, stating that he knows that JC was a nice guy, and so is Rio, but they’ve already eliminated over a quarter of the chefs who’ve started in this season, and this is about to ramp up even more… Though he does add that JC’s poor attitude during their punishment really didn’t do him any solids. In a subsequent confessional, Samuel would state that the Blue Team must be without any weak links, and is confident that they’ll bounce back a lot stronger next service. Meanwhile, Dani was with Sierra and Edward in the kitchen, as they’d talk to each other about their favorite foods and interests, with Edward stating one time how his step-mom, Amanda, made him make beef bourguignon all by himself when he was sixteen. Dani asked if it was challenging, but Edward denied this, saying it was actually a bit easy… He saw her and his dad debating what to make for dinner that night, and they decided to let him cook the beef for that night. Wanting to challenge Edward, Sierra innocently asks what’s the most difficult dish he’s made. After pondering about it, the blonde chef stated he had to cook fugu one time, and he’s not sure if he wants to even try again. Sierra wittily makes a comment to not tell Allison that, she might go on and on about how dangerous it is. About Dani, she says she has over two and a half dozen cousins over in Italy, and they were the roots of how she began her culinary career; she does mention that things do get quite messy, but that’s what happens when there’s a lot of productivity. In his confessional, Edward states how nice of a lady Dani is, and he hopes that they can stick around, and who knows, make the black jackets. In her own confessional, Sierra huffs about how it’s so splendid getting to know a thing or two about her teammates; she states that puffer fishes are known to inflate, but one touch to their spikes, and then pop!

Over with the Red Team, they were taking the route of relaxing and unwinding, with Allison confident in her confessional that after finally winning a service, it feels nice to not have to stress about what to do, because they already know what their next steps for tomorrow’s service will be; win again. Shayna brings out a board game, crokinole, stating how lucky she is the dorms had it. When Rio asked what that was, Shayna would describe the game, with Kara also lending a verbal hand, describing how to play it, and what the goal is in order to win. In her confessional, Kara states that she played crokinole before, stating it was one of those games they played whenever her school had to deal with indoor recess. Her, Shayna, Rio, and Allison played the game together, flicking disks from their quadrants, knocking each other's disks off, trying to get the most points. The other chefs looked on, quite invested on who might win, with Sierra hedging bets with Henri on who might win; their guesses being Shayna and Kara, respectively. However, as the board game wore on, it was between Rio and Allison, as they had garnered more points than the former two. Ultimately, Allison managed to knock Rio’s disk off, which hers ricochets to land in the 20-point center hole, earning her the win. She would thank the many nights of playing board games in her dorm at Ohio State for getting this victory, and she’d follow it up in her confessional, stating that the perks of living in a college dorm gave her the opportunity to play fun games like crokinole, and jokingly states they might as well name her the ‘Crokinole Queen’. Eventually, both teams began to tire out, as it was starting to get a bit late, and tomorrow called for a brand new day.

**Challenge**

The next morning, everyone would wake up to get dressed, and head down for their next challenge. As soon as they made it across the kitchen and into the dining room, they were stunned to find it completely disorganized; tables were moved around a bunch, chairs looked like they had been toppled over, and curtains draped over the windows. Ramsay was in the middle of the fray, sitting on top of a white-clothed table that was surrounded by the chaos, looking all content and relaxed, greeting everyone upon arrival. Isabela would make a confessional that this season, they’ve seen Ramsay cook without a shirt on, him in fishing gear, and now she feels like they’re watching him all laid back; she wonders if Miami is doing a number on his usual fire. The British chef would address the mess in the dining room, Ramsay started giving the teams details of what their next challenge will be; he addresses them with the grocery bags at the entrance of the restaurant, and the maze of dining equipment that presents them. Before he continues explaining what the challenge means, he turns to Marino, ordering him to kill the lights. Marino obliges, turning off all the light energy in the dining room and kitchen, making everything go pitch-black, save for a few gas lamps conveniently placed by the sous chefs in each kitchen. As everyone reacts to Hell’s Kitchen going dark, Kara makes a confessional (in the dark) of how everything is so dark, she can’t even see, even imitating a howling ghost. Ramsay would order Marino to turn the lights back on, with Marino turning them back on. When Marino turned the lights back on, Freddie stated this is the second time in a row that Ramsay’s had Marino in charge of the light switch, and no shit is that going to be used for their next challenge. Ramsay would tell each team that he’s going to put their teamwork and trust to the test, as they’ll have to adjust to cooking in a dark setting. However, that’s not the only thing they’ll be doing in the dark; he gestures to them the grocery bags on the ground, and tells them that four chefs will be in charge of carrying those bags to the kitchen… The catch is, and he addresses the maze of tables spread out across the dining room, and he tells them that it’ll be so dark in the room, that they’ll have to rely on their teammates to meander through them. Tem states in her confessional that she’s going to have a lot of trouble getting through; she mentions a time when she was young and she stepped on a Lego trying to get back to bed in the middle of the night. Ramsay also added that any food they drop during their trip back to the kitchen, it’s dead inventory; they won’t be able to use it, even making a warning that it could be a valuable asset for those who’d need to cook with it. Meanwhile, Henri would state in his confessional that with age comes more difficulties; he’s worried that the dark will be the death of him, especially since his vision’s already deteriorating. Ramsay would then tell them that after both teams make it to their kitchens safely, those cooking will cook what they have, but only pick from a certain grocery bag; because three chefs from each team will cook different foods; one will cook an appetizer, one an entree, and one a dessert. He makes it very clear that whatever bag they don’t choose will be discarded. Additionally, those cooking will be working with little light, gesturing battery lanterns by each station, where they’re working, meaning this entire challenge will take place in the dark, with some brightness to accompany those cooking. And to make sure they don’t cut themselves, he’s provided them gloves to wear. As for now, they need to talk amongst themselves about who should do what…

With both teams splitting up, they decided to see who was going to do which portion. Over with the Red Team, Rio volunteered to take the bags, asking who wants to join him. Kara is also next to join in with him, wanting to try and do something fun like that. Ruben says in his confessional that Rio calls himself gay, but he’s unsure if he believes that statement, stating that he knows he’s got both Kara and even Isabela around his neck. Ruben immediately calls that he’s going to be cooking, and no take-backsies. Henri also volunteers to join, stating that he feels a bit more at ease with cooking than getting himself hurt, though Allison reminds him he’s forty years of age, not double that, and while Henri agrees, he admits that he’s a bit clumsy when it comes to these sorts of activities. In her confessional, Allison snarks about how Henri acts a lot decrepit, stating she’s worked with an instructor who’s eighty-two back in Ohio State, one who’s survived pancreatic cancer twice, and insists they’re much stronger than Henri. Allison volunteers to ‘keep watch’ of Henri, meaning she’s going to be cooking the food with him and Ruben, meaning Shayna and Isabela are the ones in charge with handling the groceries. In her confessional, Isabela states she would’ve loved to cook again, but she’ll have to deal with doing that next time. Over with the Blue Team, however, Edward volunteers to cook the food, wanting to prove himself, but Sierra asks him what else he has got to prove, stating he’s doing a good job already, and if anything, she should be the one to cook. Edward nods and invites her to cook alongside him, and in his confessional, he states how nice Sierra really is so far since the swap. However, Samuel and David start jumping on each other to see who was going to be the final cook, before Tem mediates the situation and suggests to them they play ‘rock, paper, scissors’, and whoever beats the other can cook. The two men oblige, and after a tie where both got scissors, Samuel tops David by getting paper over the latter’s rock. In his confessional, Samuel says that he wants to try and redeem himself after yesterday’s challenge failure, and hopes to bounce back with something unique. As for David, he states in his own confessional that he wishes he could redeem himself, but he does hope that Samuel has a great idea on what to cook. This leaves him with Tem, Freddie, and Dani to carry the groceries. As they take their positions, Ramsay says before they begin, the sous chefs have something for them. Sure enough, James and Michelle hand them crates, which feature night vision goggles, and Samuel is seen in a confessional wearing them, stating that this is like being in a *Call of Duty* mission. Ramsay advises them that while they’re carrying groceries, they must be giving them directions on where to go, explaining that part of being a team player is to help other teammates. He asks if he’s understood, and with a “Yes, chef,”, Ramsay also mentions that when one team’s teammates make it back to the kitchen, then the timer for the cooking portion will begin, meaning the other team who’s slagging behind might need to get their act together. He also reminds them that they cannot say what’s inside the bags unless they’re all back in the kitchen. With those taking the overfilled grocery bags lined up at the other end of the dining room, Ramsay starts the countdown, and when he gets to one, he orders Marino to kill the lights, beginning the challenge!

**Grocery-handlers - Kara, Isabela, Shayna, & Rio vs. Dani, David, Tem, & Freddie**

**Appetizers - Ruben vs. Samuel**

**Entrees - Allison vs. Edward**

**Desserts - Henri vs. Sierra**

\-----

Everyone carrying groceries began traversing through the darkened dining room, carefully trying to tread and be careful of any furniture that might get in their way. Meanwhile, the chefs in charge of keeping a sharp eye on them wore their night vision goggles, as they kept calling out to them on where to go, and what to do. All the while, Ramsay is also keeping watch, and making sure that none of them go back for any ingredients that they’ve dropped along the way; he’s also wearing night vision goggles. This is prevalent when Rio accidentally stumbled into a fallen table and dropped a bag of carrots, and Ramsay tells him that he lost it, that means it’s gone forever. In his confessional, Rio says that he hopes those carrots don’t mean anything significant. Meanwhile, the cooks at the kitchen kept guiding their teammates closer, giving them movement pieces to pivot left or right. Shayna says in her confessional that she’s hearing so many voices, and she understands why, but there really shouldn’t be any reason to panic just yet. Samuel is very direct with guiding the grocery handlers, telling them where to go… though Dani accidentally loses a bag of gnocchi after hitting a table. Meanwhile, Kara accidentally loses a few fruits after hitting a chair leg, and she awkwardly chuckles in her confessional, hoping that they can make do without them. Though the cooks helped maneuver them through the messy dining room, there were some groceries lost in the fray; a ground beef, a beet plant, a bag of marshmallows, etc. This still didn’t stop the handlers from continuing on, as their chefs in the kitchen continued giving them verbal guidelines to go which way. In his confessional, Edward states that giving directions for his teammates to go through a power outage isn’t something he’s certain to do, since this is a competition to become the next head chef for Ramsay, but at the same time, he knows it’s also about teamwork, and he’s sure to give it to them without a doubt. The first person to reach the kitchen is David, who signals to his other teammates that he found the kitchen entryway. With the other three joining him, the Blue Team started to get to work, leaving the Red Team to continue with their challenge. In her confessional, Allison mutters on what she’s even doing here, because between Ruben barking orders and Henri being slow to the punch, things need to change now. Allison begins to become more vocal by giving her team’s grocery handlers explicit direction on where to go. Things started to move in a much better way, up to such a point where the Red Team finally reunited, meaning they could begin the cooking portion of the challenge. However, then came the idea of which grocery bag they needed to discard, and they decided to check the ingredients… They decide to toss out the one with the most amount of ingredients lost; in that case, Kara’s bag. Each team member sets up which bag they’ll be working with; Ruben will cook an App using Isabela’s bag, Allison will cook an Entree with Shayna’s bag, and Henri will make a Dessert with Rio’s. Meanwhile, over on the Blue Team, they ask themselves if they could look into what they could use now, but Sierra reminds them they have to hurry quickly. In her confessional, she knows Ramsay said they can look at what’s inside each bag, but they need to get going if they want to finally win a challenge. After a bit of debilitating, they agree that they should get rid of Tem’s grocery bag, seeing as there were some ingredients lost, while Tem braces in her confessional, hoping everyone has an idea of what to make. The decisions are made for who’ll cook from which bag; Samuel cooking the App with Freddie’s bag, Edward cooking the Entree with David’s bag, and Sierra using Dani’s bag to make a Dessert. 

Though everything was dim, the sous chefs also made sure to check each chef cooking, wearing dimmed light helmets to see what’s going on. As Shayna unraveled her bag for Allison, she found packs of chicken breasts, chicken hearts, soy, chili peppers… But what struck her most was black licorice. Meanwhile, Allison was prepping the dish, but when she saw that there wasn’t a lot of ingredients to compliment any chicken dish, she groaned in her confessional, because she should’ve known that this was going to be a disaster from the get-go, and maybe Kara’s bag would’ve been useful after all. But Michelle would ask her what she was making, and after a little deliberation with Shayna, Allison states she’s going to try something unique; teriyaki chicken hearts with a little melted black licorice. She acknowledges it sounds gross, but it might work. Meanwhile, Ruben sorted through some steak ingredients, and Isabela mentioned he could make do with a steak skewer dish, Ruben says he’s got a ‘better idea’, though Isabela wonders in her confessional what it might be, because even if steaks are more Entree-oriented, they do make good small appetizers. Though Isabela is stunned to find him crisping up onions, while also flattening the steak with a mallet, and when she and Michelle ask what he’s doing, he states he’s going to make something spectacular; something that’ll impress Ramsay; he’s making steak nuggets. Michelle would advise him to be conscious about the limited time they have, only for Ruben to laugh her off, and follow up in his confessional, stating that Michelle thinks she’s the shit, but he’s cooked this before, and he can prove her wrong when he gets a great score later. As for Henri, he and Rio unpacked the grocery bag, and through a little bit of ingredient-sorting, they find cocoa powder and peanut butter, and though Rio makes a lighthearted joke about how this would be a good idea to use them as a way to make a special entree, Henri reminds them that he’s got to make a dessert. However, he finds an avocado and some flour and sugar, which gives him an idea… Henri reveals in his confessional that he’s thinking of making a chocolate tart for the challenge, stating that everyone loves chocolate, and he thinks that he might want to use the avocado for something special. He decides to whip up the flour and sugar to make a sort of crust for the dessert, determined to make something from scratch. When Michelle went over to check on him, he told her what he’s making, with Michelle advising him with tips on how to handle certain pie tarts. Though it was very dark for him to work on it, he seemed determined to try and get it done, keeping the mixing bowls near the lantern. In his subsequent confessional, he states that he doesn’t like to perform in the dark, but at the same time, he’s sure he can make a dessert straightforwardly. 

Meanwhile, Edward burrowed through David’s grocery bag, wondering what to use, as he hoped to try making a little seafood dish to make, but he was met with salmon and a few bits of spices that he’s uncertain might not mend well, as well as a few other foreign ingredients; purple onions, potato chips, root beer, orange soda… He said in his confessional he knows it won’t suffice much if he uses any of those ingredients. The other option was a ham hock, and he could try something like that. However, David notices root beer and suggests to him to try making something out of that instead, suggesting he make the root beer into a sort of glaze or marinade. Seeing it as an idea he could try, he sticks with it, prepping to make a ham dish, but one that hopefully reaches a gambit. David has a confessional of his own, stating that it’s all about making a gamble, and what he wants is to make sure his teammates can give something that would be worth a shot at scoring high, even if it means coming up with obscure ingredients to use. Meanwhile, Samuel had already taken out squid from Freddie’s bag, but was hoping to crisp it up and make it into some kind of salad. When James goes over with his headlamp, illuminating more of what Sam’s cooking, Sam reveals to him he’s making a squid salad. James would also ask what he intends to do with a bag of candied blood orange slices, seeing as they’re close to them, and Samuel responds he’s going to make it a little more inspiring, seeing how there weren't a lot of Japanese-style ingredients from Freddie’s bag. In his confessional, Samuel states that he would’ve wanted to do something more straightforward with a squid salad, but the blood oranges he saw were what he had to use. Freddie helped guide Samuel with the lack of brightness around him, while he makes his own confessional, stating that it’s all about coming up with something creative, and showing a great amount of effort in doing so. Then there was Sierra, who found ingredients she could use to make a cobbler. In her confessional, she says everyone loves fruit cobblers, but since she’s got pineapple in the bag, she’s going to have to work on that. While working on the crust, she wants to use something other than ice cream to top off the cobbler, given how it’s tough for her to make it in a small amount of time. When James asked her what she was going to be making, she mentioned she was also going to make crème fraîche, which has a consistency similar to sour cream, but it’s a bit more sweeter. She confidently mentions in her next confessional that she’s got this handled, and she doesn’t care if the power’s out, she’s got it.

As time was winding down, all the chefs were finishing up their dishes, hoping to beat the clock and plate them by the time the lights go back on. Meanwhile, Edward had taken out his ham hock, applying root beer glaze onto the meat. Though he’s not sure if he’s applying a lot on it, as he squints and puts the ham near the lantern he was using. In his confessional, he states that time’s getting close, and he doesn’t know if he’s applied enough glaze on it or not, but he’s assuming that he’s put on enough. Allison, on the other hand, worked on taking her chicken hearts off her pan. Though she barely had light on, she inspected the chickens, expressing confidence that they’re done. As she dresses them with the black licorice-teriyaki sauce, she states in her confessional that she might think it’s the unthinkable, but she’s hoping that a little ingredient mix-ins can make her mark on this challenge. Over with Sierra, she was working on her cream for the cobbler, when she started smelling something that was about to become overcooked… Sierra cursed under her breath as she noticed her crust for the cobbler starting to overcook. She mutters in her confessional about how she can barely even see, but she’s sure that her crust is burning. Before it could overcook any further, she placed the crust off the pan, hoping to salvage the dish with some improvising. And with time getting close, Ramsay began calling the final few seconds of the challenge, meaning everyone had to start plating, as well as put their plates onto the pass for judgement. Meanwhile, Ruben stated in his confessional that he knows his steak nuggets will make the passing grade. 

The challenge was finally complete, and with every dish at the pass, Ramsay was congratulating everyone once again for another finish. Marino would turn the lights back on, and he’d give his own congratulations to each team, saying they’ve made it without plenty of accidents. However, as Marino kept monologuing, the lights suddenly turned off again! This created a little pandemonium, with Ramsay cursing what’s going on, ordering Marino to go and check the power box. But in this darkened chaos, a familiar voice was heard in pitch black…

**???:** “*Hey, is everything okay here? Why’s Hell’s Kitchen all dark and scary? I thought this was Miami!*”

That voice came not from Ramsay, nor Marino… as the chefs wondered out loud who that could possibly be… For the two men in question, though…

**Marino:** “*Chef, sembra familiare. Who do you think it is?*”

**Ramsay:** “*Fuck me… That voice sounds just like…*”

The lights suddenly turned back on, and standing in front of both Ramsay and Marino was another man, wearing a military helmet and night vision goggles, holding another light switch in his hand.

**Man:** “*Ta-daaaaa!!*” *(a second later…)* “*Whoops, apologies.*”

That man was no ordinary man… Lifting the goggles up revealed to be none other than the former maitre d’hotel himself; the one who stood by Gordon Ramsay all those years ago, and Ramsay’s friend… **Jean-Phillippe Susilovic**! The entire dining room lit up with excitement as he took off his helmet, making a grand spectacle. Kara would squeal in her confessional of how she can’t believe that JP of all people had returned. Marino would greet his predecessor warmly, while Ramsay, chuckling to himself, said to himself that it’s like JP never left at all. JP flamboyantly says that everyone thought that after his last season, with flashbacks of Season 12, was the last time Hell’s Kitchen would see him, but not today! He thought he’d surprise Chef Ramsay, Marino, and well, everyone, with a little return. He wants to help judge the finalists… only to taper off when he noticed there were more than two contestants; fourteen. JP clumsily asks Ramsay what’s going on, and Ramsay explains to the former maitre d’ they’re not even at the finale yet. JP feigned awkwardness, scratching his head, only for Ramsay to ask if he’d be willing to judge this challenge, to which JP excitedly says he’d love to. In her confessional, Shayna states she grew up watching JP work in Hell’s Kitchen, and she can’t believe he’s here once again for another blast, even if it is to judge their food. Ramsay and JP would take seats, while Marino steps up to remind them they’ve made one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert, but Ramsay butts into his monologue and reminds him who’s really in charge of the competition. In his confessional, David chuckles about how it’s like watching *The Three Stooges*, yet Ramsay’s the only one who knows exactly what he’s doing.

The Appetizer round was called first, with Ruben and Samuel being summoned with their dishes. After they shook hands with JP, Ramsay turned his attention to Ruben, asking what kind of dish he made. Ruben describes his onion-filled steak nuggets with a dijon mustard sauce drizzled on top. The judge trio were a bit skeptical on that approach, but Ruben states it’s a kind of appetizer people would kill to try, though Ramsay does quip it would be one to try at a pub. Ignoring Ruben’s leer, as Ramsay cuts into one of them, JP says that hearing this dish ‘steak nuggets’ sounds a bit new to his ears. Marino agrees, asking if he did something with the onions inside, and Ruben responds he sauteed them. Ramsay shows them that the little steak nugget he cut into indeed has sauteed onions, but its presentation is messy; the onions are all over the place. After each at one nugget, JP makes a comment on how the dijon definitely goes well with steak, and it otherwise tastes pretty good, but does state it’s a little messy, pointing out to some onions dripping on his plate. Ramsay agrees to this, and he asks amongst the maitre d’s what they think, on a scale of one to five. JP says with that dish, it’s a safe appetizer, but not one that’s too inspiring with that presentation; it’s a three for him, with Marino agreeing, but Ramsay says it’s a little too less inspiring, giving Ruben’s dish 2 points; this gives the Red Team 8 points. Ruben snarks in his confessional, stating that not everyone’s got to have that fine dining etiquette they ‘oh so desperately want’. Turning to Samuel, Samuel presents his squid salad with watercress, cucumber, and candied blood orange slices. Marino points out he’s added a little dressing on it, and asks him to describe that as well; Samuel says it’s a little vinaigrette he added along with it. The trio take turns notating how the dish looks pretty splendid, but if it tastes good as it looks is the million dollar question. Ramsay cuts into the squid, and notes how it’s cooked beautifully, even joking how even with the lights nearly out, he managed to find a way to make it cooked right. After tasting it and the salad, JP mentions how salads that contain squid contain a Japanese edge to it, and while Samuel didn’t replicate that, he somehow managed to make it into a restaurant dish. Marino concurs to this, stating that the acidity and sweetness of the candied blood orange balanced out the brine, and it does taste like a restaurant dish. Grading it, Ramsay, Marino, and JP collectively say it’s a 4, giving the Blue Team a score of 12 compared to the Red Team’s 8, and Samuel says in his confessional that it feels good making something unique and getting a superb score on it. 

Next up was Allison and Edward with their Entrees, and Ramsay would ask Allison what she made, and Allison states she made teriyaki chicken hearts, and she even mentions she added a speck of black licorice. However, the words black licorice were what made Ramsay especially lock eyes with Allison, and when he asks her to repeat what she said, he lets out a sigh, stating that he’s fond of creativity in any dish… as long as they work together, and he’s not sure if black licorice and teriyaki *belong* together. Though JP does mention it might, as long as it has a consistent balance. However, his heart would be broken as Ramsay cuts into one heart to find it undercooked. Ramsay asks Allison if she really graduated with a 4.0 rating to show them this, though Allison says it was either that or chicken breasts she’d cook with. Marino mentions that chicken breasts are a lot easier to cook with, considering how they’re easier to cook tender in a limited time. Ramsay shamefully says it’s unfortunate, he thought to have been proven wrong that black licorice doesn’t go with teriyaki, but with the chicken heart being raw, he’s giving her a 1, with Marino doing the same. However, JP sheepishly states he’s giving her a 2, and when a curious Ramsay asks why, JP mentions that the licorice-teriyaki combo could indeed work; such a concept like that could work, as there are some unique ideas on how to use different candies and mold them into dishes, but ultimately, since they cannot taste the dish. He’d personally give her a 1, but for the effort she pulled, it’d be a 2, which baffled Ramsay, who says he’ll have to take JP up on that challenge after this season. In her confessional, Allison states that at least JP had a good idea on what she was trying to do, and judging Edward’s dish, she’s sure he’s gonna do something even worse. Ramsay asks Edward to describe his dish, and he responds by explaining a root beer-glazed ham hock dish with asparagus as a side dish. JP makes a joke on how he’s made so much, there’s probably no room for their stomachs to take it. Meanwhile, Edward prays in his confessional that the root beer he uses can do him a favor, while Allison smirks in her own confessional, asking what would root beer do to even embellish a dish. Upon the trio tasting the ham, Marino mentions how it has this sweet, yet savory kind of taste to it, and it has a little kick to it, asking what kind of spices did he use. When Edward mentions he used jalapeno; he knew jalapeno peppers were spicy, but it was one that worked more than the habanero he was about to use. Ramsay said that even with that miniscule spiciness, these flavors balance each other out, and it’s delicious… However, he does want to make a mention of how he tastes the meat, and it’s slightly overcooked. Edward scratches his head when he hears this, but Ramsay says it’s still pretty delicious overall. He gives his dish a 3, with Marino giving him another 3 in agreement, also adding that as long as it tastes good and it’s cooked, it’s still a nice restaurant dish, just not the first option in the elements of fine dining, but still great. As for JP, Ramsay turned and saw him going back for another taste, and JP says that it definitely is a delicious one, even if it’s slightly overcooked, and he breaks from Ramsay and Marino, giving Edward a 4, bringing the Blue Team up 22-12. Edward cheers in his confessional, mentioning how he’s even got Jean-Phillippe to see how great he can make dishes, while Ramsay chortles on how much of a wildcard the former maitre d’ is. Meanwhile, Allison grimaces at this, as she makes another confessional, scowling at the camera for a little longer than usual, before finally uttering two words, “*Root. Beer.*”

While the Blue Team held a ten-point lead, the challenge wasn’t over; now came the Dessert round, and Ramsay makes a witty quip, suggesting there’s no chance that they should be fucking this up, though JP and Marino snicker amongst themselves. Though Ramsay ignores this, he continues, asking Henri and Sierra to step forward. Turning their attention to Henri, JP immediately takes notice of his Frenchspeak, wondering if he’s from the foothills of Bordeaux, or the rich, stunning beauty of Paris. After clarifying to the former maitre d’ that he’s originally from Quebec, the two engage in a little playful bantering between France’s influence on America and Europe. Sierra chuckles in her confessional of how Henri found himself a new best friend in JP. Moving on from that, Henri presents his chocolate avocado tart with a drizzle of peanut butter. The judges note how pleasant it looks, and when JP asks if he’s cooked desserts where he’s from, Henri mentions that he has, but because of Carnival Cruise Line’s menu, he can’t really improvise and make a tart like that, to which Ramsay fills him in on him working on a cruise ship. The three judges taste the dessert, and JP mentions how chocolate desserts are known to be on the heavy side, but it’s a very melt-in-your-mouth-kind of heavy. Marino agrees, stubbornly going after the tart for a second bite, while Ramsay laughs at this. The Brit mentions how decadent it tastes, but at the same time, it’s very mouthwatering, and he can tell that Henri had cooked this beautifully, to a point where he can’t even find anything to criticize. It came to nobody’s surprise that Henri got all 5s from the judges, catapulting the Red Team to 27, giving them the lead. Henri wipes the sweat off his brow in his confessional, stating it wasn’t easy making it, especially when he had to deal with low lighting, but he managed to make all of the judges satisfied with his cooking. Last, but not least, was Sierra, who presented her own dessert; pineapple cobbler with hot honey and crème fraîche. A curious JP mentions how cobblers usually include ice cream, but he mentions that crème fraîche has the same consistency as sour cream, but it’s a lot less sour. Ramsay agrees to this, wondering how good it tastes… However, upon tasting the dish, they find out that the crust for the cobbler is a bit… overcooked, as Ramsay describes it as using a shovel to break through moist solid ground, and that’s beach sand from the tidal waves. Though upon eating it, they mention how the pineapple and cream is delicious, and when Marino asks what she used for the hot honey, Sierra explains she used dried chili peppers for it, but not too much. Ramsay commends her for the effort in garnishing her dessert, but says he can’t really get past the burnt crust… Marino agrees, stating that if it weren’t for the fact it was overcooked, he’d give it a 4, but he’d settle for a 3. Ramsay nods, stating that even with how delicious the dish looks, it’s a shame that the crust kind of gives it a ‘reset’, so he’s giving it a 2, giving the Blue Team 26 points. But when they turn to JP for his thoughts on the dish, he mentions that it’s a tough one… He knows Sierra has the right idea, but at the same time, he does agree with Ramsay a bit that the crust is too cooked. As for the overall dish… He would score it with…

As the Blue Team celebrated their challenge victory, JP clarifies that even with the crust being overcooked, it’s still a fairly ‘scrumdelicious’ dessert, and even pokes to Sierra that perhaps if it were lighter in there, she’d make it even more magical. Neither Ramsay nor Marino made any interjections, while Sierra chuckles, sighing in her confessional that she got her team the win, thanking JP over and over again. Meanwhile, while the Red Team were a bit mixed that they lost, Henri states in his confessional that he’s got nothing bad against Sierra, because even with a dish presented like that, she had a great idea, and it was enough for Ramsay and the two maitre d’s to award her and her team the win.

*   **Ticket Stipends:** Provide a voucher for a certain dollar amount that can be used for concerts, sporting events, a local play, or a movie night. It's personal and flexible.

## ### Tips for a Successful Gifting Strategy

Finding the right gift is only half the battle. The *way* you give it matters just as much.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=holiday%20gifts%20for%20employees)

*   **Set a Budget (and Stick to It):** It's the thought that counts. Determine a realistic per-employee budget. Your sincerity is more valuable than an extravagant price tag.
*   **Presentation is Key:** Don't just hand over a box in a plastic bag. Take the time to wrap it nicely or include a handwritten, personalized note from leadership.
*   **Timing is Everything:** The first or second week of December is usually a sweet spot. It’s early enough to avoid the last-minute holiday rush but feels festive.
*   **Make it Inclusive:** Be mindful of diverse holidays, traditions, and dietary restrictions. If you're giving food, consider providing options. Gifts should be a source of joy for everyone on your team.

## ### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How much should I spend on an employee holiday gift?**
**A:** There's no magic number. It depends entirely on your company size and budget. A common range is between $25 and $150 per employee. Remember, a thoughtful $50 gift is always better than a thoughtless $100 one.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=holiday%20gifts%20for%20employees)

**Q: Are gift cards a good or bad idea?**
**A:** They're convenient, but can feel impersonal. If you go this route, make it more thoughtful. Instead of a generic Visa card, choose a gift card to a platform they'll love, like a local restaurant, a high-end bookstore, or an experience-based service like Airbnb.

**Q: Should gifts be the same for everyone?**
**A:** For fairness and simplicity, it's usually best to give the same type of gift at the same value. However, if you offer a selection of a few different options (e.g., ""choose one of these three gifts""), you can add a layer of personalization while maintaining equity.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=holiday%20gifts%20for%20employees)

**Q: What's the best gift for a remote team?**
**A:** Focus on items that enhance their remote work experience or help them feel connected. Think high-end tech (headphones, webcams), a curated home-office care package, or a virtual team experience.

1osb87v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictedToTemplates/comments/1osb87v/my_antiinflammatory_diet_routine_that_changed_my/,My Anti-Inflammatory Diet Routine That Changed My Life,"I never knew this before. But having a good anti-inflammatory diet is very helpful for menopause symptoms - this was what I needed desperately but never knew before!

I started following this diet just because I was having some stomach issues. This solved not only my digestion issues but also knocked out my perimenopause symptoms too! I was having constant night sweats that were making it impossible for me to sleep at night.

So I am listing here some things that I have been eating and what I have removed from my daily routine -

✅ Stewed Apples - I often go for raw apples, but someone told me that eating cooked apples helps to release the pectin in the skin and even makes it easier to digest and helps to reduce inflammation. I add a little cinnamon.. tastes better :)

✅  Sardines - Never, this has been my fav, but I added this recently to my breakfast list. They are really quick, no need to cook them at all! I see some people dont like it, so no worries, you can skip this.

🚫 Processed and Replacement sugar - I was obsessed with this, but I needed to cut it down. I now prefer jaggery. And most of the time, my coffee is sugar-free! Even no sugar for yogurt.. anything for my health :)

  
✅ Blueberries - My personal fav. I have been taking this for my breakfast for a very long time.

✅ Iced Green Tea -  I take this 4-5 times a week along with some honey. I prefer taking it with my meals.

✅ Lemon - I used to skip lemon a lot. But now I take them with water or tea.

✅ Sweet potatoes -  I prefer roasting in the oven with little coconut oil and even cinnamon. 

✅ Spaghetti Squash - Fav of many here. I take this with ground chicken and pasta sauce.

🚫 Alcohol - Now I prefer no alcohol at all. I get better results without this on my diet.

🚫 - Processed/packaged foods - I love processed food a lot. But with this, I will never get the results I wanted. So I needed to remove this from my diet completely. It's been 2 months now, NO PROCESSED food at all! It's working great. I still crave for packed food. I will give myself a break, but for now, I'll continue with my routine.

✅ Fatty fish - Not a seafood girl, but this brings results faster. Sardines, salmon and tuna are great. Make spicy bowls with brown rice, avocado, and a little greek yogurt and sriracha. I add a little soy sauce, and taking this with seaweed snacks is always great!

  
This is all! I always keep updating my diet. So I'll keep posting here.

My husband is obsessed with ice coffee--drinks it multiple times a day, every day. We have made it ourselves in the past but never made a habit of it so now he just buys premade cartons of it at the grocery store.

I'd like to buy him a cold brew machine for Christmas but what I'm thinking of doesn't seem to exist? Is there a machine where you just put in grounds and water, it steeps for 24ish hours then automatically strains it and it's waiting for you (ideally cooled) for whenever you want to dispense a cup? Maybe even diluting it for you with cold water? I've been researching for hours and found nothing like this.

And yes, I know cold brewing with a toddy system or even just mason jars is very cheap and easy but I know us and know that we will not keep up with it. I just want to buy him a robot that can make it as hands off as possible but haven't found anything.

Anyone have any leads or advice?

The closest thing I've come across is the Fellow Aiden, which has an almost but not true cold brew recipe that you can schedule in advance to have ready for you in the morning, but this seems like a lot of machine for somebody that only drinks iced coffee.

\------

The heavy winds of Montana’s Tobacco Root range rolled in across the prairies, kicking choking dust up into the air. The coarse sand spilled from the Precambrian rock formations spattered throughout the valley, marking the ancient passage of glaciers from thousands of years earlier.

  
The multi-story spires of ancient sun-bleached sandstone stood tall, but when compared to the equally grey mountains beyond the valley’s pine-covered foothills, they might as well have been an insignificant nothingness. Ants standing before eldritch gods.

  
But that form of ancient wonder was not something that held the attention of a lone figure trundling down an old dirt road. Thin scrub grass scratched his pressed pants; their little fingers grabbed and tore loose every thread of wool they could. 

  
The dry silt clung to every nook and cranny of his once pristine leather dress shoes, as small rocks were crushed beneath each footfall; every plodding step adding to the never-ending dust.

  
An ancient and unknowable enemy of mankind was taking its toll on him; an invisible beast, but one that assured you paid your cost in mucus, dried eyes, and fits of sneezing— allergies. 

  
He coughed and spat out phlegm again before wiping his brow with the white button-down sleeve of his shirt, leaving the material stained with wet dust and ruining the shirt. Typically, he would have been upset about his shirt being soiled, but after wearing the same clothes for a week straight without a chance to wash them, all he had left to wear was already destroyed.

  
“Can you shut the fuck up!?” Luke yelled up at the sky moments after an agricultural drone buzzed overhead; its whirring repulsion engines grating on his last nerve.

  
Never in his life had he believed that everything he had planned for years could fall apart in a matter of seconds. But somehow it happened to him. A soon-to-be fiancé...gone. All of his so-called friends...abandoned him. Even his own mother thought he was some monster in human skin after the lies she had propagated.

  
Initially, when Luke saw Jackie in their room with ----, he would rather not think about what he had seen or what she had done. Recounting what happened before he ran from his old life still hurt like glass shards being driven into his brain. It still made him dry heave and gag a week post-revelation of how fake their love had been.

  
Luke had assumed his flight from Olympus Mons University and silence about what happened would not have meant much beyond having to alert a few people of where he was going, but the effects were far beyond that. 

  
Now, he was all alone within the vast universe.

  
His doctorate was in question because the dean of the agricultural department bought that liar's story without question and revoked his scholarships, placing him on probation due to integrity violations. 

  
That they had been working together for nearly a decade meant nothing to Professor Swate when Jackie put on the waterworks and twisted her betrayal into illicit accusations against his morality.

  
The only person back at Olympus Mons University who supported Luke was Doctor Harold Dimula, Luke’s longtime genetics and applied agricultural growth teacher. His support was undoubtedly what kept Luke from indulging in a sinful meal of alkaloid botany.

  
Dimula, bless him, gave Luke a less-than-lethal path to escape the situation. He felt pity after seeing how far the once bright-eyed and eager graduate student had fallen to alcohol and self-loathing.

  
That non-fatal solution to his problems was not some proof to clear his name of assault, nor would it set the world right, but it did offer him sanctuary. All it would cost Luke was his presence, expertise in 24th-century farming and agriculture, and the willingness to do whatever the owner expected to ensure the ranch's success.

  
The ranch had been scraping by for years and had been in desperate need of assistance. Luke asked why they had never hired people when problems began to occur, but Dimula never gave Luke an answer that made sense. Something about his answer still seemed wrong, like he was not telling Luke the entire story.

  
“Well, Kurkel is a stubborn man, and he probably did not feel spending what little money they had would fix the issues,” Dimula had explained. “He is a real ‘pull yourself up by the bootstraps’ kind of man. You know the type.”

  
Luke indeed knew the type and expected this ranch to be troubled by the same issue he had seen many times while earning his masters degree, and his now never-to-be doctorate. The farmer was stubborn, stuck in their ways, and did not wish to adapt to modern tools and techniques, resulting in them falling behind in production. A sinful thing that the coalition of planets had sent more failures to an *applicable skills camp* for. 

  
Stubborn old farmers were a tale as old as time. Luke just hoped this time would be a different case; he had fruitlessly battled enough old timers when it came to fixing their fields and plants, doing so again was not an appealing idea.

  
Luke especially hoped so because if the farmer were lugged off to a *skill camp,* it would cost him the three hots and a cot, something he was in desperate need of here on earth. He didn't know anyone. Dimula’s friend was Luke's only connection to his species' cradle world; if this did not pan out, Luke had no idea where he would go. 

  
Luke looked down at his Data slate and groaned. There were still another four hours of walking to reach the entrance to his friend Kurkel’s ranch, “Golden Fields.”

  
If that lazy driver had taken him all the way to the ranch, Luke would have been there hours ago and hopefully already burying himself within whatever work the ranch needed. But apparently, going the last few miles down the road into the old dusty town of Grey Rock and hanging a left onto the only road leading to Golden fields was unfeasible.

  
The man complained that the dirt and rocks would scratch his car. That was nothing but an excuse to take the money and run, leaving the rider high and dry. In fact, such a scam was a standard issue across coalition space, because payment had to be given upfront for services, it was in the cabbie's best interest to cut and run. They already had their money after all.

   
With no other choice on how to reach his destination, Luke soldiered on, marching through the Montana early spring heat without faltering.

  
Despite his sour mood, Luke had to appreciate the beauty of this place. Endless rolling fields touched the mountain foothills. Farms of varying types could be seen just as far. The only thing breaking up the infinite continuity was the babbling of brooks or the distant sound of service roads.

  
Cattle grazed beneath the shade offered by the gargantuan solar kites cabled almost half a mile in the air.

  
The shadows cast by those monumental creations of industry were like stationary clouds, always offering one reprieve from the heat and scalding radiation Sol emitted.

  
Not only did the local fauna find them as a place to seek shelter, as Luke crested a small hillock and the town of Grey Rock came into view, a group of local teenagers waved at him from beneath one of the kites while they lounged in a small brook. 

  
He returned the gesture and momentarily considered hopping the fence to grab a drink after one of the scantily clad girls offered him a beer. He decided against it, shouting “Thanks but no thanks” in a crackly dry voice.

  
By the time he was almost to the town’s outskirts, a new sound grew into the orchestra of nature’s bounty. A dull, thrumming noise arose and eventually overtook the bleating of goats, the mooing of cattle, and the whistling wind through the solar kite cables.

  
It was the sound of a vehicle, an old combustion engine, and tires on dirt. Luke had never heard one in person before. They were not used on Mars at all, and even here on Earth, they were considered archaic and only used in heavy-duty industries where the torque they allowed was needed, or in places like this town.

  
Towns where Earth forgot, and they preferred it that way. A small town, full of people happy with small, uneventful lives.

  
“Well, hello there, lad. Where you heading?” a male voice said loudly, overpowering the sounds of the engine as the truck pulled up from behind Luke and stopped.

  
The man looked old and well-worn, with wrinkled, tan skin, grey hair, and a set of overalls that were barely held together by rough, hand-sewn stitching. 

  
Compared to the man, the vehicle looked young. Hard-bodied steel, spattered with rust, its once-vibrant green paint and the logo on the cab's side were barely discernible.

   
“Golden Fields,” Luke replied, clearing his brow with his sleeve yet again. “What makes you ask?”

  
“Spotted you a few miles back, right when you walked past my place,” the man replied. He jutted a thumb over his shoulder. “Back at the Johnson place. You walked right by my mailbox. And I figured you looked a little lost, so I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”

  
Luke thought of it for a moment and recalled the house and the lone mailbox. The aforementioned house loomed atop one of the hills, surrounded by miles and miles of barley and rhubarb. The sprouts waved steadily like an ocean between the road and the old prairie-style home. He could even recall this old rambling truck, parked beside it.

  
“Ah, I see,” Luke replied.

  
Luke had to admit he did look quite out of place around here. He was dressed like a lost lawyer, not a farmhand, or a local by any means. That this old man's sharp green eyes spotted the interloper within their midst was not shocking.

  
Every time Luke went to a new farming community, he was quickly assessed as an outsider and treated as such. It was not that the sapients in those places were insular and hated him; they just showed both hesitant caution of out-groups, and wanted to ensure he did not wander into places he had no right to be in.

  
He was lucky enough to never have dealt with the latter issue. But he had heard tales of other contracted agricultural researchers and workers stumbling upon illicit narcotic productions or scandalous affairs.

  
The locals never appreciated them finding what should have been well hidden. As such, the outsider was run out of town, not unlike the tax collectors of the old American colonies nearly five hundred years earlier.

  
So, learning from the follies of his contemporaries and predecessors, Luke took the man up on the offer for a ride, through town and to the destination where he would bury his old life to whither, and ultimately be forgotten.

  
“Hank Johnson,” the man said, extending a well-worn hand toward Luke once the younger human had settled into the seat in the truck.

  
“Luke Stephens,” Luke replied, returning the handshake.

  
“Well, it is nice to meet you, Luke,” Hank said as the truck started to roll.

  
“Same,” Luke nodded.

  
They entered Grey Rock, and Hank began to ramble on about the town. The town itself was nothing special compared to the dozens of others Luke had called home over the years. Slant roofs, solar panels shimmering, with grey duracrete bricks held together with mortar. 

  
If you could not check the date on your calendar, it would look no different from a developing town in the twenty-first century. 

  
Hand-drawn signs and fading brick shops included. Luke just hoped this town's drunk was more pleasant than the last one. That asshole ended up stealing the catalytic converter from several of his previous clients' tractor-bots. An infraction that had the coalition's jackboots whisk him away in the night. 

  
Hank, through his overly excited tales, ensured that the stranger knew everything there was to do within the area. Hank was a font of knowledge: the local grocery store and its hours, the dinner and the confectionery coffee cakes Maria only sold on Sunday mornings, and of course, the farming store; A location Luke would be needing for his job, if his previous bouts with failing agricultural plots were anything to go by.

  
He was already racking numbers in his mind. How many chits would fresh herbicide, fungicide, and the methods to deploy them cost his soon-to-be employer and landlord? He could make wild assumptions, but without the whole picture, putting much effort into such an action was a waste of effort. 

  
The town had a healthy amount of mixed species, something that was not common on Earth but was very common on Mars.

  
They passed by several dozen Servilk shopping for the day. They were tall, lean, and cat-like, covered in thick fur in as many colors and patterns as domestic felines.

  
A Varintol woman pushed a cart filled with early growth squash. She, like most of that Ursine-like species’ females, was buxom, towering, and covered with both steel cable-like muscle and insulating fat and fur so thick you could drown in it.

  
She spotted Luke watching her from a stoplight and waved, giving him a brimming smile that showed off her several-inch-long fangs. Those shining daggers could give a kodiak bear a wicked case of insecurity issues.

  
The only other species they saw was a man that Hank pulled off to the side of the road to speak to. 

  
“Hey, Brukus, you got that replacement cylinder for my old car?” Hank said, leaning out of the window toward a Torelin man, hefting a whole V8 engine block over his shoulder from the open bay doors of *Brukus’ Breaks, Pads, Boosters, and Balancing.*

  
Brukus paused and turned toward them, the light playing off his horns, amber fur, and oil-stained overalls. He was gargantuan, even by his species' standards. Luke would likely only come up to the alien man’s abs.

  
Torelin were bull-like bipeds, but to the average Human, they were the spitting image of a Minotaur from ancient myth. They typically had broad shoulders, muscles bulging from underneath thin hair-like fur, and a set of horns pulled right off a Texas longhorn.

  
Luke had heard the females of their species were a bit softer and did not have a look of perpetual hatred in their eyes, but he had never seen one, so as far as he was concerned, the entire species looked like they always wanted to kill you.

  
“I got it right here,” Brukus said, shaking the engine over his shoulder, looking like he was lifting mere pounds, not a whole ton.

  
“That’s great,” Hank said. “Want me to tow the beast over later?”

  
“Not today. I still have to finish Mikey’s ride. But I can get you yours tomorrow,” Brukus said, stepping over and stopping slightly to look into the cab.

  
He looked over at Luke, his sharp, hate-filled eyes scanning him for a hidden weapon or intent. He found nothing but another outsider. A man who would run away soon enough. “And who is this?”

  
“Ah, this here is Luke, he is goin’ up to Kurkel’s place too,” Hank said, but stopped and looked back at Luke. “Well, I don’t rightly know why he is heading there, but he seems like a good lad.”

  
“So, what are you heading up there for----Luke,” Brukus raised a brow and snorted, adding Luke’s name like it was an afterthought.

  
“I took up a contract they sent to Olympus Mons. I’m supposed to help out with getting the ranch running in the green,” Luke explained flatly, trying not to feel intimidated by the freakishly sized man.

  
“I see, well, that’s good. Morel has been having a tough time of it since she came back home,” Brukus said, scratching a short bit of hair on his chin that looked somewhat like a goatee.

  
“Who is Morel? I was told the place was owned and run by Kurkel?” Luke asked.

  
Hank and Brukus shared a glance, a dour look befalling both of them. Kurkel must have been a sensitive subject around town.

  
“Well, he did own it for many years. But about a decade ago, his wife passed, and about five years ago, Morel wandered off to Europe for art school. Running that big ol’ place on his own took its toll, and last year Kurkel went off an’ died,” Hank said, making the sign of the cross in the air. “God bless his soul.”

  
“And Morel came back to run the farm and can’t pull it out from the red?” Luke asked.

  
“That’s the long and short of it,” Hank confirmed.

  
That certainly changed the perspective of the situation at hand. Luke truly had no idea what was going on at Golden Fields. Years of neglect from Kurkel, and now his daughter, who, based on her chosen field of study, had no heart for farming or ranching. Who knew what state Golden Fields was in?

  
The entire area could resemble anything from an overgrown rainforest to a horrendously arid savannah. Both extremes were easily doable with the wrong farming techniques or biotechnology.

  
“Oi, kid,” Brukus said, pulling Luke out of his daydream. “When you get there, do me a favor and be patient with Morel, and also don’t mention her dad. She is a nice woman, and that is still a sensitive topic. So working out what happened to the farm might be a bit of a minefield if you lay all the blame on a dead man...or her.”

  
“Don’t worry. I wasn’t planning on doing that. It’s not my job to judge how something ended up that way. My job is to find solutions,” Luke explained, knowing these two likely had heard that spiel from his type before. Everyone in his field of study knew that was the creed the government forced upon them. 

  
“But, I will do my best to be sensitive,” Luke finished.

  
“Perfect, ‘Cause if yah’ don’t” Brukusus nodded, before turning away and heading back into his workshop, not looking back as Hank waved goodbye and shouted a time he would bring the car over. All Brukusus did as an acknowledgement of the comment was whip his tail and lightly nod.

  
With goodbyes said and what Luke took as a warning all done, he and Hank rolled on through the rest of the little town without any further delays. Before Luke knew it, they had taken the road north out of town, leaving behind the blacktop and returning to dirt.

  
Blooms of dust kicked up as they rumbled along, coating the wooden fences and bumper. They did not speak much as they completed the last of the drive. Up and over a pine-covered hill, and five minutes more was all it took.

  
Off in the distance over the swaying fields of untended, wildly growing wheat was the main ranch gate of Golden Fields. Luke’s salvation, and his only chance at a future. 

  
The wooden fence attached to the gate was in disrepair, with crossbeams fallen or missing in many spots. Where it was not falling apart, vines lashed it together.

  
As they neared the gate, the state of decay of the sign was immediately evident. The Slab Serif font clearly displayed the name, but old cracks ran through the chipped paint.

  
Two Iron rod gates should have been closed along with a cattle guard. But the gates were open, and rusted in that position. Meanwhile, the cattle guard was so full of dirt that the truck ambled over it without so much as a change in sound.

  
Luke's salvation was looking more like a prison sentence by the second.

  
Once past the gates, they traversed a small orchard, all overgrown as well. Detritus and unpicked fruits from last year’s harvest rotted on the ground, to the delight of the dozens of rodents that skittered throughout the boughs and foliage.

  
“What did they grow here?” Luke asked, nearly gagging on the sickly sweet rot rolling in through the open window, not being able to identify the trees clearly due to how well and truly overgrown they all were.

  
“Oh, they grew quite a few fruit here... Le’me think...” Hank said, chewing on his lip for a moment. “Mostly pears, peaches, and some cherries. I do know that Morel planted an avocado tree near her window as a little lass, but they never sold any of them.”

  
None of that was odd for the region. All of those plants grow well within this climate. This area of Montana, although it experienced long winters, sometimes with the first snows arriving as early as late August, was also blessed with a robust summer and growing season.

  
The real challenge for farmers was managing to harvest enough crops within a short timeframe to bring to market and satisfy the coalition tithes. It was not impossible for the average farmer, but if the state of the fields was anything to go by, Luke knew that harvesting yield was one issue he and Morel would have to discuss in great detail.

  
The truck burst through the tree branches, sending budding fruit and twigs bouncing off the cab with dull thunks. Luke gaped as his new home came entirely into view.

  
This was not just a house, no, it was an industrial compound.

  
Nearly a dozen buildings of various sizes and purposes were bathed in the vibrant yellow sunlight. Most were easy to identify even from this high vantage: garage, the main barn, crop processing, and what looked like workers' lodging.

  
There were a few he could not identify, but he knew they were likely miscellaneous storage or possibly coops and habitats for smaller animals. But those were questions he could answer later. What drew Luke's eye was the central house.

  
It was built with two floors, but stood nearly as tall as a standard four-story building. It had vibrant wood walls, a green metal roof, and was shaded beneath several mighty oak trees and a tiny avocado tree. 

  
The main lodge sported enough windows that anyone inside would have surely already spotted their approach, a theory that was given credence less than a minute later. 

  
As Hank pulled up and stopped just before a set of stairs that led up to the porch, the door to the main house opened, and out stepped a woman that Luke could have never seen coming.

  
She was stunning, almost otherworldly,

  
She took a moment and adjusted her tight plaid button-up shirt, trying to show off slightly less cream colored cleavage, but that was a pointless effort. Her bust was as bountiful as an autumn harvest, but in no way looked out of place, given her staggering height and luscious hourglass figure; much like Brukusus, the top of Luke's head barely reached her chest.

   
Morel gave up on buttoning the top few clasps and smiled before sauntering forward, her hips swaying with a bold confidence that could only be showcased in such tight-fitting jeans. Morel’s smile nearly knocked Luke on his ass. 

  
The small poof ball at the tip of her tail peaked out on occasion as it swayed in opposite time with her confidently swaying waist.

  
As she stepped down the stairs, her polished hooves clopped on the planks. Her tussled bob cut hair shone with a brilliance that would make the sun envious. Peeking out from the shimmering golden weaves was a set of white horns that curved like ivory spears toward the sky.

  
“Why hello there, Hank, to what do I owe the pleasure?” Morel said in a voice as sweet as apple pie, and thick with the southern accent of the women who baked the best ones.

  
“Hello, there, little Miss Morel,” Hank tipped his cap and looked over at Luke. “Oh, I just found this ‘ere youngin’ traipsing up the road, bound for here. So I gave him a little lift.”

  
“Oh, did you now?” Morel said, turning her attention to Luke.

  
Her forest green eyes scanned him quickly, not in a judgmental way, but more as if she was giving the strange man at her home a once-over and gaining her first impression. Whatever Morel saw, she must not have hated, because her smile grew to reach her eyes, pushing that little mole beside her plush lips to move.

  
“Well, thank you for bringing him here. I will be sure to give him a ride wherever he may need once our business is done,” Morel said, looking back at Hank.

  
“Ain’t nothing.” Hank waved, before a realization of something appeared in his aged eyes. “Oh yeah, if you want, you're more than welcome to come over for supper. “Holly made ten bean soup. We would love to have you and Luke there to swing on by.”

  
“That does sound good. I will see if I can make it over. I have to see what Luke wants first. But I will let you know,” Morel replied.

  
“Alright, then. I hope you two kids have a nice time,” Hank said, looking over at Luke and giving him a wink, one that Morel saw clear as day.

  
Hank turned the car around and left. Morel and Luke watched as the vehicle reached the orchard at the hilltop. Once gone, Morel addressed Luke. “Sorry if he said anything odd. Uncle Hank is a bit...much,” Morel said, scratching behind her head and blushing slightly.

  
“He didn’t seem that bad. But Uncle?” Luke asked.

  
“He is not my actual uncle, but he and his wife watched me when my parents were busy, so they are my auntie and uncle,” Morel explained. “But, enough about that. What can I do for you? I don’t get a lot of visitors these days.”

  
“My professor sent me here. He said you all needed help with your farm and were offering lodging and meals as compensation.” Luke said, turning his data slate around so Morel could see the Emails sent from Kurkel to Dimula, asking desperately for help.

  
Morel took hold of the dataslate, but paused and gestured toward some chairs on the porch. “Would it be alright if we go sit down while I read this over?”

  
“Of course,” Luke replied, not having much of a choice.

  
He followed Morel up the stairs and averted his eyes from her shapely rear. He had enough issues with women; lingering on the attractiveness of Morel would only cause him more trouble. Once at the chairs, Luke clambered into one of them, it being slightly too large for him, making him look like a kid at the adults' table for the first time.

  
“Wait right here, sug’, I’m going to get us some refreshments,” Morel cooed, setting the data slate down and heading into the house.

  
Through the open window, Morel's humming could be heard. It was as smooth as silk, filled with joy and jubilation. He looked across the yard, listening to her slow, meandering song. It was paced to fill the early spring day perfectly.

  
Rabbits hopped inside some pens around their homes across the yard. Their little noses rooted around through clovers and small flowers, searching for the most succulent petals. Although technically a ranch, there was no sign of any cattle, horses, or other large animals. Luke did find that to be slightly odd, but for all he knew, the animals were deeper within the several thousand acres Morel owned.

  
Luke yelped as a light swat patted against his leg, wrenching him from his thoughts of what was going on at the farm; interruptions to his idle thoughts seemed to be a theme for the day. It was as if the universe itself did not wish to allow him to bury his pain in work and forget what she did.

  
He retreated slightly on the chair, pulling his legs up before hesitantly peering over the side, looking for the aggressor. All he saw was the simple wooden deck. He was about to call out to Morel to ask about rodents when a light mew brought his attention to his side. 

  
A small amber kitten rubbed against his flank, having used his fright to ascend the chair unnoticed. If it were a snake, it would have bitten him. 

  
“Hey there, little guy,” Luke said, reaching down to stroke along the now purring kitten’s back. The little fuzz ball was more than happy to receive the affection, nuzzling into his dirty stomach and moving to settle in atop Luke’s lap.

  
By the time Morel had returned, the kitten had fallen asleep, curled up like he owned the Human. That or that Luke was his new favorite perch to look out across the yard in search of mice.

  
“Your cat is cute,” Luke said, as Morel placed a platter on the table.

  
“Cat?” Morel tilted her head, her bovine-like ears fluttering in curiosity.

  
“Yeah,” Luke pointed at the little kitten.

  
Morel peered over the edge of the table and frowned before settling down and pushing the tray toward Luke. “He is just a barn cat. I can’t rightly say he is mine. He won’t even let me touch him.”

  
Luke frowned and looked down at the cat. He understood why it was untrusting of Morel. He was young, likely only born a few months earlier. With no other signs of other fauna near Morel's size, she likely intimidated the little thing. 

  
“Don’t worry, I’m certain he will warm up to you,” Luke said, picking up his tea and taking a sip.

  
“Hopefully. The only friend I’ve had since moving back has been the bunnies over there,” Morel sighed, pointing at the rabbit enclosure.

  
“No other animals on the ranch?”

  
“Not currently. I had to sell the herd last spring to make tithe,” Morel breathed, her ears drooping.

  
“Well, that’s a pickle.”

  
“Yeah, but that is in the past and not your concern, let me take a look at this,” Morel said, picking up the dataslate and opening the Email. “Please help yourself to some snacks or more tea.”

  
Luke did just that while Morel reviewed the transmissions. The spread was delicious and shockingly artistic.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, along with multiple types of dip, were arranged in an intricate flower pattern, with each petal constructed from a different kind of snack.

  
Arranged beneath the flower, representing dirt, were crackers of various types of bread: rye, white, garlic, and even a succulently hardy nut loaf.

  
To wash it all down, Morel had blessed Luke with sweet tea that would give you diabetes if you did not monitor your intake. That drink was a true boon for Luke. After his miles and miles of walking, he needed something to drink; so much so that by the time Morel had finished reading, he had sucked down half of the pitcher.

  
“Alright, Luke. This is definitely something my father had sent to your professor. But this is the first I’ve heard about it,” Morel said, taking up her own beverage and looking out over the fields ponderously.

  
“And you don’t want to honor it?” Luke asked, assuming the worst possible scenario.

  
Morel took a sip of her drink to wash down a cracker. She did not answer for a minute, leaving Luke to fear for the sanctuary he had been promised and desperately needed. But eventually she swirled her glass, sighed, and looked back at Luke. 

  
“I never said that I would not; in fact. I really do need some help around here,” Morel said.

  
“So I can stay?” Luke asked.

  
“Aye, you can, so long as I still have the farm and you are willing to help me fix it,” Morel said.

  
“Of course I will help,” Luke agreed. “But I do have a question. “What do you mean by so long as you have it? Is the coalition saying they are ready to replace you and take the farm?”

  
“Do you have time for a story? Or would you rather I get you set up in a room first?” Morel questioned.

  
“Please, if I’m going to help, I need to know what’s going on.”

  
“Alright.” Morel sighed, pouring herself another drink and grabbing a tomato. She bit into it and chewed on it slowly, like cud, while ruminating on the past events, organizing them in a way that would make the explanation easier to digest. After she swallowed, Morel looked over at Luke with a pained gleam in her vibrant eyes. “Alright, so this is the situation....”

1osaynz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1osaynz/being_watched_by_my_neighborscommunity_worker/,Being watched by my neighbors/community worker.,"Last year, I moved into a 2 bedroom mobile home inside a family community park. I have a boyfriend, but he has his own place, and I wanted something of my own as well. So I did the walk through and everything by myself, and he only came to help me move my things from my apartment to the new house . 

Once we started moving things in, problems started to happen. The floor was soft in most of the rooms and didn't feel safe. The plumbing was leaking and, in some areas, completely disconnected.  Im freaking out because I had inspections and now I have a loan on a house thats not even liveable , so my boyfriend good man he is says he will help me fix so I dont need to mess up my insurance by using it on the first day.  

During all this chaos, we meet a neighbor who lives not next door but one over, but it's a dead end, so we all share the end of the street. Come to find out, he works for the community.  He is a maintenance man. Over the coming weeks the demo showed how bad the damage to the sub floor was and it was a full tear out and rebuild plus all new water lines needed to be ran with ne shut offs the works .we'll over 6 months and my boyfriend has spent every day off he has working on my house for free  well for food lol . 

He has 3 more rooms to completely gut and rebuild, but my roof is starting to show its age and needs to be recoated again, not a problem. My boyfriend is on it .

Well, my boyfriend came to me today and said he really dont feel comfortable being at my house anymore . When I asked why, he said the maintenance man is watching your house, and I dont want to get you introuble . I was confused, so I asked for more info. He told me he has had conversations with him that he thought was friendly but he sees it was just for information because im here so much fixing stuff it looks like I live here and they have an issue with it.   

I still wasn't sure what he meant, so I asked again to explain . He said that because he's a smoker, he is outside much morethann me and mostly alone.  Whenever he sees the neighbor he gives him a fake smile says hello and then says in spanish to his wife he back again and the wife never says high to ether and is always kinda smug when she sees me and the husbands not around. He sees it like there watching him and he pointed out that on nights he sleeps over and they see him because he goes outside to smoke there living room windows are wide open by 7am when we leave to get coffee or go out for breakfast but only in the days he sleeps over . I thought he was lyin,  but he is either right or its odd that they just want sunlight when he is here. 


He also told me he caught the maintenance using our side yard as a cut through on his golf cart so it just seems like i have no privacy and they really dont want me to be the one fixing this stuff because they have offered to fix stuff for me but its never cheap. 

My boyfriend gave me a copy of his lease and said if th le community office comes around and tries to complain that im no on file with them as a tenan,  I havesomethingg to defend myself with. He wants me to sell the house as he feels him moving in later   would h be  problematic . Like are my neighbors stalking me. He also said everyone go cameras put up a few weeks after he started coming by regularly  to do the remodeling. 

Also, I pick up my boyfriend. I have a suv, and he just leaves whatever tools here, so he never has a car in my driveway, and he doesn't want to bring his car here at all now . His car regularly in my driveway is all they need to come bother me . 

Most of what he had said I've found to be somewhat true.

Chapter 1
The biggest bombshell of the year at the Ivy League university was that the first sex tape of Chloe from the art department was posted in the campus group chat.
The video was shot in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
Chloe was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a head taller than her, the intimate rhythmic sounds non-stop.
When it was over, the man whispered in her ear, ""Good girl.""
Those two simple words were like a bombshell, causing a huge uproar in the group chat.
[That voice... could it be Liam?]
[Chloe really has her ways, managing to hook up with our school's trustee!
No wonder her bullies haven't been bothering her anymore.]
[I always thought Chloe was some innocent girl, but it turns out she's a scheming bitch. Just what you'd expect from a mistress's daughter!]
When the news reached Chloe, she was in her dorm room knitting a scarf for Liam.
Her roommate turned the video's volume to max, passing the phone around with a sneer, deliberately drawing out her words:
""Chloe, you sound so skilled. You must have done many times, huh?""
Laughter erupted around her. Chloe froze, her face pale, the half-finished scarf slipping from her hands as she got up and bolted out the door.
She stumbled towards Liam's office, wanting to ask him what the video was all about.
But as soon as she got to the door, she heard mocking voices from inside.
""Liam, you really showed Chloe no mercy. You deliberately made sure her face was so clear. She doesn't even have a chance to clear her name.""
Hearing this, Chloe's mind went blank, and a chill instantly spread through her entire body.
""Well, it's her own fault for pissing off the woman Liam love most. She deserves it.""
""It was just tough on our Liam, having to spread rumors about Chloe's mother being the mistress, and then playing the savior to deal with her bullies, acting all in love in front of her.""
""By the way, Liam, when are you going to tell her the truth?
If she finds out the guy she's liked for so long is actually her future brother-in-law, she'll probably cry herself out on the spot, hahaha...""
Liam, lounging on the sofa, tapped the ash from his cigarette on the edge of the ashtray, his expression unreadable.
Seeing him silent, his buddy next to him quickly asked, ""Feeling sorry for her?
Back then, she went to great lengths to send Serena abroad for two whole years, leaving her to starve and freeze. I can't just let her get away with it!""
Hearing Serena's name, Liam finally reacted.
He stubbed out his cigarette and said flatly, ""Wait until Serena returns.""
""That day also happens to be an anniversary Chloe has been looking forward to for a long time. I'll give her a 'surprise' and make her pay back everything she owes Serena.""
Chloe's breath caught. Her gaze cut through the smoke to Liam's cold, stern face, and she felt as if her heart had been ripped open, the pain so intense her vision went blurred.
So it was Liam who spread all those rumors slandering her mother!
Liam pursued her and protected her, all just for revenge.
The person he truly loves is her half-sister, Serena.
Chloe couldn't bear to hear any more and turned to flee in a panic.
But she hadn't gone more than a few steps when a group of women blocked her path.
""Well, well, the girl in that explicit video?!""
""Just came from the office? Couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""
Chloe's face was pale as she tried to get away, but the group just pushed her back and forth.
Just then, Liam's icy voice came from behind her—
""You dare touch Chloe right under my nose? Do you have a death wish?""
Liam had left the office at some point, and his tall, imposing figure was now strolling toward them.
The girls scattered the moment they saw Liam.
Liam came to Chloe's side, reached out to smooth her disheveled hair, and as he leaned down to look into her eyes, he gently caressed her cheek with his thumb.
""Didn't I tell you? If anyone bullies you again, just drop my name.""
The familiar smell of tobacco filled her nose, stinging her eyes and making them burn.
The Liam before her now merged with the memory of the man who had protected her so many times, feeling like an old dream.
After her mother's suicide, her father got back together with his first love, leaving her to live a life that was worse than an orphan's.
Later, rumors flew around school that her mother was a mistress, and that Serena was the true, legitimate daughter of the Carter family.
As ""a mistress's daughter,"" she was inevitably bullied.
It was Liam who rescued her from her misery. Using his position on the school board, he effortlessly carved out a safe haven for her.
Yesterday was Liam's birthday, and emboldened by alcohol, they slept together. He dropped his usual elegant and refined facade, forcefully pinning her against the bare floor-to-ceiling window, watching her body tremble with nervousness.
As Liam claimed her, Chloe felt like a long-lost bird finally returning to its nest.
Little did she know, her return to the nest was built on one scheme after another.
Chloe was in a daze.
By the time she snapped out of it, Liam had already led her out of the office building and she was in the passenger seat of his car.
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
Liam leaned over to fasten her seatbelt as usual. Noticing her red-rimmed eyes, he said softly, ""The video was an accident. I'll handle it. You're not yourself today, I'll take you home so you can rest.""
Chloe bit her lip. As she recalled his words in the office, tears began to fall uncontrollably.
Liam froze for a second, then raised his hand to wipe her tears. A moment later, as if remembering something, he opened his door and said, ""Wait here, I'm going to buy something.""
The door closed, and only then did Chloe realize Liam had taken the wrong phone.
His phone was in the slot by the armrest, and on a strange impulse, Chloe picked it up and typed Serena's birthday as the password.
The phone unlocked, and Chloe saw Serena's name in the pinned chats on WhatsApp.
In their recent chat history, Serena asked him if he could end their relationship with her before she returned to the country.
Liam replied: Just a plaything, I never wanted to be with her.
Chloe's heart clenched, and fighting back the sting in her nose, she kept scrolling up.
During the two years Serena was abroad, Liam called her every single day without fail, always around eight in the evening.
This was also the time he claimed to have board meetings, telling Chloe not to disturb him no matter what.
On top of that, he would transfer money to Serena every month, amounts as high as six figures, so straightforward that there was never even a memo.
Serena was also very good at being cute, occasionally sending a few selfies looking for praise, and Liam would reply with cute emoji Chloe had never seen before, reminding her not to wear too little and catch a cold.
Looking at these chat logs, Chloe finally understood that she had never really known Liam at all.
The tenderness and consideration he showed was just the tip of the iceberg of his overwhelming love for Serena.
When Liam returned to the car, he placed a box of morning-after pills in her hand.
Liam gently stroked the top of her head and said in an incredibly gentle tone, ""Last night was a bit rushed, I wasn't careful. Take this, just in case.""
Chloe clutched the pill box tightly in her hands, biting her lip so hard it almost bled.
If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she would probably still be foolishly thinking that Liam genuinely had her best interests at heart.
Now, she was wide awake.
After the car stopped in front of the villa, Liam leaned in to kiss her goodbye out of habit, but Chloe dodged his kiss and fumbled to unbuckle her seatbelt.
The man's eyes darkened, and he forcefully pulled her into his arms.
""Still upset about the video?""
""...""
""I didn't record the video, and the hotel manager has already been fired.""
Liam lifted her chin, ""Chloe, I never meant to hurt you, and I never will.
Our anniversary is coming up soon, and I'll make it up to you properly then.""
Lies disguised as kindness are often more hurtful than the truth.
Chloe's nose stung, and she pushed Liam away, saying, ""I'm going inside.""
She practically ran into the villa.
But as soon as she got through the door, she ran right into Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter's face was grim, and before Chloe could speak, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.
""Chloe, I really underestimated you. Dating is acceptable, but you even made that kind of indecent video—you've completely ruined my reputation!""
""No wonder those people at your school are always targeting you. It's because you're so filthy and disgusting yourself, you attract all the flies!""
After his tirade, Mr. Carter threw a plane ticket in front of Chloe.
""I've booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get as far away as you can and never come back!""
Chloe picked up the plane ticket from the floor, her fingers trembling slightly, as if it were a verdict sentencing her to be completely abandoned by the world.
Her father found her disgraceful and wanted her to leave.
Just as well, she didn't want to stay anymore either.
""I'll go.""
Chloe's tone was calm. ""And I'll do as you say. I'll never come back.""
Mr. Carter was stunned, thinking he had misheard.
He had arranged for Serena to study abroad and tried to persuade Chloe to go with her, but Chloe refused. Only after repeated questioning did he learn that she was in dating and was head over heels in love.
He thought Chloe would refuse again.
But he didn't expect her to agree so readily this time.
Mr. Carter's anger subsided a little, and he said coldly:
""Serena is coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome-home banquet for her, and you'll be there too.""
""The video is already out. If you don't show up, it will only confirm all the rumors.""
Chloe nodded, ""I know.""
...
Chloe took three days off from school.
She spent those three days packing up everything Liam had ever given her and sold them all online for the original price.
Three days later, Serena returned from abroad.
Mr. Carter threw a welcome-home banquet for her at the biggest hotel in Los Angeles, inviting all the big names in the business world.
That included Liam.
Chloe didn't expect to run into Liam there. As she turned to leave, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a deserted corner.
Liam pinned her against the wall, his hands firmly planted on either side of her, his hot breath fanning against her ear.
""You haven't been to school these past few days, you're not answering my messages, and you were silent even on our anniversary.""
""Chloe, you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
His eyes were locked on her, clearly unhappy about her disappearance.
Chloe pressed her lips together, mustering the courage to meet Liam's gaze. ""So, Liam actually worries about an insignificant sex buddy?""
The usually docile and obedient Chloe suddenly showing a temper surprised Liam a little.
A rebellious feeling surged through him, and he yanked Chloe closer, his arm wrapping tightly around her waist.
""Sex buddy?""
""Once in two years, and you call that a relationship only with sex?""
Chloe didn't know what had gotten into Liam, as he grabbed her chin and was about to kiss her.
Just then, a voice sounded nearby.
""Liam, you are here. Serena's looking for you.""
Liam frowned slightly, let go of Chloe, and said to the person, ""Got it, I'll be right there.""
Chloe pretended to be surprised and asked Liam, ""You know my sister?""
""Know her? Their relationship is more exciting than you think.""
Liam's friend had a teasing look on his face. ""Chloe, just you wait. You will be shocked.""
After the two had walked away, a flash of mockery crossed Chloe's eyes.
These people thought she was still in the dark, planning to stage a grand humiliation for her today.
But they didn't know she had already composed herself, ready to make a clean break with Liam.
As the banquet was in full swing, the lights went out.
An instant later, a spotlight hit the stage, revealing a sharply dressed Liam with Serena, who was in a white gown, on his arm.
Mr. Carter, beaming, raised his hand for silence and announced loudly:
""I've invited you all here today for two reasons: first, to welcome Serena home from her studies, and second, to announce some good news.""
""The Carter and Sterling families are friends for generations, and years ago, we arranged a marriage for Serena and Liam.""
""Now, they are deeply in love, and the formal engagement banquet will be held at the end of the month. I hope you will all come to witness their happiness!""
​
After Mr. Carter finished speaking, Liam's friends all turned to look at Chloe, waiting to enjoy the sight of her breaking down.
But Chloe just stood quietly in the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Liam frowned slightly.
In his mind, Chloe was supposed to lose control when she found out about his relationship with Serena.
But right now, she was a little too calm.
A strange restlessness stirred in Liam's heart. Serena, sensing something was off, quickly asked, ""Liam, what's wrong?""
Liam subtly averted his gaze. ""It's nothing. I just zoned out for a second.""
He knew very well that Chloe's feelings for him ran deep; it was impossible for her to have no reaction.
She was just putting on a brave face.
...
Chloe went to the restroom and splashed her face hard with cold water.
Thinking back on her past infatuation with Liam, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had only touched her once in two years.
It wasn't because he cherished her, but because he couldn't even be bothered to touch her.
And the first sex she had always treasured was, to him, just perfect material to ruin her reputation.
Just as Chloe returned to the banquet hall, Mr. Carter called her over.
""Chloe, come here. This is your brother-in-law.""
Chloe walked up to Liam, a perfect smile playing on her lips. ""Brother-in-law.""
Hearing the words ""brother-in-law,"" Liam's expression tightened.
But Serena didn't seem to notice, smiling brightly. ""Chloe, I just heard that Liam is on the board of directors at your school. What a coincidence! If you run into any trouble in the future, just ask your brother-in-law for help. After all, we're all family.""
Chloe gritted her teeth and said, word by word, ""I won't cause my brother-in-law any trouble.""
She didn't look at Liam's face, but she could feel his piercing gaze, like a freezing wind in the dead of winter, making her tremble.
After a few simple pleasantries, Chloe prepared to leave.
But Serena stepped forward and took her arm, feigning intimacy. ""Chloe, we haven't seen each other in so long. I have so much I want to tell you.""
Without another word, she dragged Chloe to a lounge.
The moment the door closed, Serena dropped her smile, her expression turning cold and sinister.
""Chloe, I heard you slept with Liam, and the video is all over the place. Did you think you could cling to hm with such a cheap trick?""
""Let me tell you the truth. He doesn't like you at all. Not only does he not like you, he's utterly disgusted by you!""
""I asked him to spread the rumor that your mom was the mistress. I told him to pursue you. I just wanted to watch you fall in love with him, only to be destroyed by him personally!""
Chapter 4
Chapter 4
Chloe: ""Why?""
""Why?
Because you have no shame, of course. Your mom's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to the Carter family's things?""
""All of that was supposed to be mine! What right do you, the daughter of a mistress, have to enjoy the Carter family's wealth and luxury!""
Chloe could tolerate anything, but she could not tolerate her mother being insulted.
She lunged in front of Serena, her voice squeezed through her teeth:
""My mother was not the mistress. When she married my father, she didn't know he has married your mother.""
""It's you! Drove her to death!!""
Serena hadn't expected Chloe to talk back to her, and raised her hand to slap her.
Just then, the door to the lounge was pushed open.
Catching sight of Liam, Serena quickly grabbed some nut pastries from the table and stuffed them into her mouth.
The next moment, she went limp and collapsed, mumbling, ""Chloe, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Liam rushed over to Serena and pushed Chloe away.
Chloe stumbled backward, her back hitting the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the coffee table shattered, and Chloe's hands were pierced by the shards, dripping with blood.
​
Liam didn't even glance at her. He quickly knelt and pulled Serena into his arms.
""Serena, are you okay?""
With tears in her eyes, Serena helplessly grabbed Liam's arm. ""I just wanted to catch up with Chloe. I don't know what I did to offend her, but she just forced me to eat those pastries...""
""Look at me, am I breaking out in a rash?""
Liam looked down and saw large red hives rapidly breaking out all over Serena's skin.
""What should I do?
The banquet isn't over yet. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... yes, I need to cover it with makeup!""
Liam gripped Serena's wrist tightly. ""How can you be thinking about that now?
Come on, I'm taking you to the hospital.""
Liam picked Serena up, and before leaving, he shot Chloe a cold glare.
Fighting through the intense pain, Chloe struggled to her feet. Blood gushed from her hands, instantly staining the hem of her dress red.
But she couldn't feel the pain. It was as if all her senses had been stripped away the moment she fell into a bottomless abyss.
She called for a server to bring a first-aid kit and shakily managed to bandage her wounds.
Exhausted from the ordeal, Chloe dragged her feet, preparing to leave.
Just as she entered the hallway, several figures lunged out and dragged her into a nearby storage room without a word.
Then, a large hand gripped her chin hard, forcing her to look up as highly concentrated Chili Oil was poured into her mouth.
Chloe's eyes widened in terror.
Like Serena, she had allergies, and she was born allergic to chili peppers.
This much Chili Oil was enough to kill her!
""Mmph... let...""
Chloe struggled desperately.
But the men gave her no chance to resist, pouring cup after cup of Chili Oil down her throat.
She choked, her face turning beet red, and her body began to convulse violently. Her injured hands clawed feebly at the floor, making an unsettling sound.
Instead of stopping when they saw her wretched state, the men only grew more vicious, hurling insults at her:
""Serena is the woman Liam treasures. You dare to lay a hand on her? Who the hell do you think you are?""
""I heard you got bullied a lot in school. You must be completely used up by all kinds of guys by now. A man with standards as high as Liam would never want a filthy slut like you.""
""Just drink all this Chili Oil. Consider it an apology to Serena. Or else, we'll make you suffer!""
Chloe's vision grew increasingly blurry, and her consciousness began to fade.
She used the last of her strength, almost unconsciously murmuring that person's name, ""Liam...""
The moment she spoke, a piercing laugh came from above her.
""Hahaha!
You don't actually expect Liam to come save you, do you?""
""He told us to pour this Chili Oil on you. You hurt Serena, he'd be happy if you were dead!""
""Come on, let's rip her clothes off, take pictures, and send them to Liam. Let him get some satisfaction too!""
Several men swarmed her, tearing Chloe's dress to shreds in an instant.
They frantically took pictures of the barely breathing, disheveled Chloe until she couldn't hold on any longer and passed out completely.

He had arranged for Serena to study abroad and tried to persuade Chloe to go with her, but Chloe refused. Only after repeated questioning did he learn that she was in dating and was head over heels in love.
He thought Chloe would refuse again.
But he didn't expect her to agree so readily this time.
Mr. Carter's anger subsided a little, and he said coldly:
""Serena is coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome-home banquet for her, and you'll be there too.""
""The video is already out. If you don't show up, it will only confirm all the rumors.""
Chloe nodded, ""I know.""
...
Chloe took three days off from school.
She spent those three days packing up everything Liam had ever given her and sold them all online for the original price.
Three days later, Serena returned from abroad.
Mr. Carter threw a welcome-home banquet for her at the biggest hotel in Los Angeles, inviting all the big names in the business world.
That included Liam.
Chloe didn't expect to run into Liam there. As she turned to leave, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a deserted corner.
Liam pinned her against the wall, his hands firmly planted on either side of her, his hot breath fanning against her ear.
""You haven't been to school these past few days, you're not answering my messages, and you were silent even on our anniversary.""
""Chloe, you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
His eyes were locked on her, clearly unhappy about her disappearance.
Chloe pressed her lips together, mustering the courage to meet Liam's gaze. ""So, Liam actually worries about an insignificant sex buddy?""
The usually docile and obedient Chloe suddenly showing a temper surprised Liam a little.
A rebellious feeling surged through him, and he yanked Chloe closer, his arm wrapping tightly around her waist.
""Sex buddy?""
""Once in two years, and you call that a relationship only with sex?""
Chloe didn't know what had gotten into Liam, as he grabbed her chin and was about to kiss her.
Just then, a voice sounded nearby.
""Liam, you are here. Serena's looking for you.""
Liam frowned slightly, let go of Chloe, and said to the person, ""Got it, I'll be right there.""
Chloe pretended to be surprised and asked Liam, ""You know my sister?""
""Know her? Their relationship is more exciting than you think.""
Liam's friend had a teasing look on his face. ""Chloe, just you wait. You will be shocked.""
After the two had walked away, a flash of mockery crossed Chloe's eyes.
These people thought she was still in the dark, planning to stage a grand humiliation for her today.
But they didn't know she had already composed herself, ready to make a clean break with Liam.
As the banquet was in full swing, the lights went out.
An instant later, a spotlight hit the stage, revealing a sharply dressed Liam with Serena, who was in a white gown, on his arm.
Mr. Carter, beaming, raised his hand for silence and announced loudly:
""I've invited you all here today for two reasons: first, to welcome Serena home from her studies, and second, to announce some good news.""
""The Carter and Sterling families are friends for generations, and years ago, we arranged a marriage for Serena and Liam.""
""Now, they are deeply in love, and the formal engagement banquet will be held at the end of the month. I hope you will all come to witness their happiness!""
​
After Mr. Carter finished speaking, Liam's friends all turned to look at Chloe, waiting to enjoy the sight of her breaking down.
But Chloe just stood quietly in the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Liam frowned slightly.
In his mind, Chloe was supposed to lose control when she found out about his relationship with Serena.
But right now, she was a little too calm.
A strange restlessness stirred in Liam's heart. Serena, sensing something was off, quickly asked, ""Liam, what's wrong?""
Liam subtly averted his gaze. ""It's nothing. I just zoned out for a second.""
He knew very well that Chloe's feelings for him ran deep; it was impossible for her to have no reaction.
She was just putting on a brave face.
...
Chloe went to the restroom and splashed her face hard with cold water.
Thinking back on her past infatuation with Liam, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had only touched her once in two years.
It wasn't because he cherished her, but because he couldn't even be bothered to touch her.
And the first sex she had always treasured was, to him, just perfect material to ruin her reputation.
Just as Chloe returned to the banquet hall, Mr. Carter called her over.
""Chloe, come here. This is your brother-in-law.""
Chloe walked up to Liam, a perfect smile playing on her lips. ""Brother-in-law.""
Hearing the words ""brother-in-law,"" Liam's expression tightened.
But Serena didn't seem to notice, smiling brightly. ""Chloe, I just heard that Liam is on the board of directors at your school. What a coincidence! If you run into any trouble in the future, just ask your brother-in-law for help. After all, we're all family.""
Chloe gritted her teeth and said, word by word, ""I won't cause my brother-in-law any trouble.""
She didn't look at Liam's face, but she could feel his piercing gaze, like a freezing wind in the dead of winter, making her tremble.
After a few simple pleasantries, Chloe prepared to leave.
But Serena stepped forward and took her arm, feigning intimacy. ""Chloe, we haven't seen each other in so long. I have so much I want to tell you.""
Without another word, she dragged Chloe to a lounge.
The moment the door closed, Serena dropped her smile, her expression turning cold and sinister.
""Chloe, I heard you slept with Liam, and the video is all over the place. Did you think you could cling to hm with such a cheap trick?""
""Let me tell you the truth. He doesn't like you at all. Not only does he not like you, he's utterly disgusted by you!""
""I asked him to spread the rumor that your mom was the mistress. I told him to pursue you. I just wanted to watch you fall in love with him, only to be destroyed by him personally!""
Chapter 4
Chapter 4
Chloe: ""Why?""
""Why?
Because you have no shame, of course. Your mom's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to the Carter family's things?""
""All of that was supposed to be mine! What right do you, the daughter of a mistress, have to enjoy the Carter family's wealth and luxury!""
Chloe could tolerate anything, but she could not tolerate her mother being insulted.
She lunged in front of Serena, her voice squeezed through her teeth:
""My mother was not the mistress. When she married my father, she didn't know he has married your mother.""
""It's you! Drove her to death!!""
Serena hadn't expected Chloe to talk back to her, and raised her hand to slap her.
Just then, the door to the lounge was pushed open.
Catching sight of Liam, Serena quickly grabbed some nut pastries from the table and stuffed them into her mouth.
The next moment, she went limp and collapsed, mumbling, ""Chloe, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Liam rushed over to Serena and pushed Chloe away.
Chloe stumbled backward, her back hitting the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the coffee table shattered, and Chloe's hands were pierced by the shards, dripping with blood.
​
Liam didn't even glance at her. He quickly knelt and pulled Serena into his arms.
""Serena, are you okay?""
With tears in her eyes, Serena helplessly grabbed Liam's arm. ""I just wanted to catch up with Chloe. I don't know what I did to offend her, but she just forced me to eat those pastries...""
""Look at me, am I breaking out in a rash?""
Liam looked down and saw large red hives rapidly breaking out all over Serena's skin.
""What should I do?
The banquet isn't over yet. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... yes, I need to cover it with makeup!""
Liam gripped Serena's wrist tightly. ""How can you be thinking about that now?
Come on, I'm taking you to the hospital.""
Liam picked Serena up, and before leaving, he shot Chloe a cold glare.
Fighting through the intense pain, Chloe struggled to her feet. Blood gushed from her hands, instantly staining the hem of her dress red.
But she couldn't feel the pain. It was as if all her senses had been stripped away the moment she fell into a bottomless abyss.
She called for a server to bring a first-aid kit and shakily managed to bandage her wounds.
Exhausted from the ordeal, Chloe dragged her feet, preparing to leave.
Just as she entered the hallway, several figures lunged out and dragged her into a nearby storage room without a word.
Then, a large hand gripped her chin hard, forcing her to look up as highly concentrated Chili Oil was poured into her mouth.
Chloe's eyes widened in terror.
Like Serena, she had allergies, and she was born allergic to chili peppers.
This much Chili Oil was enough to kill her!
""Mmph... let...""
Chloe struggled desperately.
But the men gave her no chance to resist, pouring cup after cup of Chili Oil down her throat.
She choked, her face turning beet red, and her body began to convulse violently. Her injured hands clawed feebly at the floor, making an unsettling sound.
Instead of stopping when they saw her wretched state, the men only grew more vicious, hurling insults at her:
""Serena is the woman Liam treasures. You dare to lay a hand on her? Who the hell do you think you are?""
""I heard you got bullied a lot in school. You must be completely used up by all kinds of guys by now. A man with standards as high as Liam would never want a filthy slut like you.""
""Just drink all this Chili Oil. Consider it an apology to Serena. Or else, we'll make you suffer!""
Chloe's vision grew increasingly blurry, and her consciousness began to fade.
She used the last of her strength, almost unconsciously murmuring that person's name, ""Liam...""
The moment she spoke, a piercing laugh came from above her.
""Hahaha!
You don't actually expect Liam to come save you, do you?""
""He told us to pour this Chili Oil on you. You hurt Serena, he'd be happy if you were dead!""
""Come on, let's rip her clothes off, take pictures, and send them to Liam. Let him get some satisfaction too!""
Several men swarmed her, tearing Chloe's dress to shreds in an instant.
They frantically took pictures of the barely breathing, disheveled Chloe until she couldn't hold on any longer and passed out completely.

Chapter 1
The biggest bombshell of the year at the Ivy League university was that the first sex tape of Chloe from the art department was posted in the campus group chat.
The video was shot in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
Chloe was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a head taller than her, the intimate rhythmic sounds non-stop.
When it was over, the man whispered in her ear, ""Good girl.""
Those two simple words were like a bombshell, causing a huge uproar in the group chat.
[That voice... could it be Liam?]
[Chloe really has her ways, managing to hook up with our school's trustee!
No wonder her bullies haven't been bothering her anymore.]
[I always thought Chloe was some innocent girl, but it turns out she's a scheming bitch. Just what you'd expect from a mistress's daughter!]
When the news reached Chloe, she was in her dorm room knitting a scarf for Liam.
Her roommate turned the video's volume to max, passing the phone around with a sneer, deliberately drawing out her words:
""Chloe, you sound so skilled. You must have done many times, huh?""
Laughter erupted around her. Chloe froze, her face pale, the half-finished scarf slipping from her hands as she got up and bolted out the door.
She stumbled towards Liam's office, wanting to ask him what the video was all about.
But as soon as she got to the door, she heard mocking voices from inside.
""Liam, you really showed Chloe no mercy. You deliberately made sure her face was so clear. She doesn't even have a chance to clear her name.""
Hearing this, Chloe's mind went blank, and a chill instantly spread through her entire body.
""Well, it's her own fault for pissing off the woman Liam love most. She deserves it.""
""It was just tough on our Liam, having to spread rumors about Chloe's mother being the mistress, and then playing the savior to deal with her bullies, acting all in love in front of her.""
""By the way, Liam, when are you going to tell her the truth?
If she finds out the guy she's liked for so long is actually her future brother-in-law, she'll probably cry herself out on the spot, hahaha...""
Liam, lounging on the sofa, tapped the ash from his cigarette on the edge of the ashtray, his expression unreadable.
Seeing him silent, his buddy next to him quickly asked, ""Feeling sorry for her?
Back then, she went to great lengths to send Serena abroad for two whole years, leaving her to starve and freeze. I can't just let her get away with it!""
Hearing Serena's name, Liam finally reacted.
He stubbed out his cigarette and said flatly, ""Wait until Serena returns.""
""That day also happens to be an anniversary Chloe has been looking forward to for a long time. I'll give her a 'surprise' and make her pay back everything she owes Serena.""
Chloe's breath caught. Her gaze cut through the smoke to Liam's cold, stern face, and she felt as if her heart had been ripped open, the pain so intense her vision went blurred.
So it was Liam who spread all those rumors slandering her mother!
Liam pursued her and protected her, all just for revenge.
The person he truly loves is her half-sister, Serena.
Chloe couldn't bear to hear any more and turned to flee in a panic.
But she hadn't gone more than a few steps when a group of women blocked her path.
""Well, well, the girl in that explicit video?!""
""Just came from the office? Couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""
Chloe's face was pale as she tried to get away, but the group just pushed her back and forth.
Just then, Liam's icy voice came from behind her—
""You dare touch Chloe right under my nose? Do you have a death wish?""
Liam had left the office at some point, and his tall, imposing figure was now strolling toward them.
The girls scattered the moment they saw Liam.
Liam came to Chloe's side, reached out to smooth her disheveled hair, and as he leaned down to look into her eyes, he gently caressed her cheek with his thumb.
""Didn't I tell you? If anyone bullies you again, just drop my name.""
The familiar smell of tobacco filled her nose, stinging her eyes and making them burn.
The Liam before her now merged with the memory of the man who had protected her so many times, feeling like an old dream.
After her mother's suicide, her father got back together with his first love, leaving her to live a life that was worse than an orphan's.
Later, rumors flew around school that her mother was a mistress, and that Serena was the true, legitimate daughter of the Carter family.
As ""a mistress's daughter,"" she was inevitably bullied.
It was Liam who rescued her from her misery. Using his position on the school board, he effortlessly carved out a safe haven for her.
Yesterday was Liam's birthday, and emboldened by alcohol, they slept together. He dropped his usual elegant and refined facade, forcefully pinning her against the bare floor-to-ceiling window, watching her body tremble with nervousness.
As Liam claimed her, Chloe felt like a long-lost bird finally returning to its nest.
Little did she know, her return to the nest was built on one scheme after another.
Chloe was in a daze.
By the time she snapped out of it, Liam had already led her out of the office building and she was in the passenger seat of his car.
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
Liam leaned over to fasten her seatbelt as usual. Noticing her red-rimmed eyes, he said softly, ""The video was an accident. I'll handle it. You're not yourself today, I'll take you home so you can rest.""
Chloe bit her lip. As she recalled his words in the office, tears began to fall uncontrollably.
Liam froze for a second, then raised his hand to wipe her tears. A moment later, as if remembering something, he opened his door and said, ""Wait here, I'm going to buy something.""
The door closed, and only then did Chloe realize Liam had taken the wrong phone.
His phone was in the slot by the armrest, and on a strange impulse, Chloe picked it up and typed Serena's birthday as the password.
The phone unlocked, and Chloe saw Serena's name in the pinned chats on WhatsApp.
In their recent chat history, Serena asked him if he could end their relationship with her before she returned to the country.
Liam replied: Just a plaything, I never wanted to be with her.
Chloe's heart clenched, and fighting back the sting in her nose, she kept scrolling up.
During the two years Serena was abroad, Liam called her every single day without fail, always around eight in the evening.
This was also the time he claimed to have board meetings, telling Chloe not to disturb him no matter what.
On top of that, he would transfer money to Serena every month, amounts as high as six figures, so straightforward that there was never even a memo.
Serena was also very good at being cute, occasionally sending a few selfies looking for praise, and Liam would reply with cute emoji Chloe had never seen before, reminding her not to wear too little and catch a cold.
Looking at these chat logs, Chloe finally understood that she had never really known Liam at all.
The tenderness and consideration he showed was just the tip of the iceberg of his overwhelming love for Serena.
When Liam returned to the car, he placed a box of morning-after pills in her hand.
Liam gently stroked the top of her head and said in an incredibly gentle tone, ""Last night was a bit rushed, I wasn't careful. Take this, just in case.""
Chloe clutched the pill box tightly in her hands, biting her lip so hard it almost bled.
If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she would probably still be foolishly thinking that Liam genuinely had her best interests at heart.
Now, she was wide awake.
After the car stopped in front of the villa, Liam leaned in to kiss her goodbye out of habit, but Chloe dodged his kiss and fumbled to unbuckle her seatbelt.
The man's eyes darkened, and he forcefully pulled her into his arms.
""Still upset about the video?""
""...""
""I didn't record the video, and the hotel manager has already been fired.""
Liam lifted her chin, ""Chloe, I never meant to hurt you, and I never will.
Our anniversary is coming up soon, and I'll make it up to you properly then.""
Lies disguised as kindness are often more hurtful than the truth.
Chloe's nose stung, and she pushed Liam away, saying, ""I'm going inside.""
She practically ran into the villa.
But as soon as she got through the door, she ran right into Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter's face was grim, and before Chloe could speak, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.
""Chloe, I really underestimated you. Dating is acceptable, but you even made that kind of indecent video—you've completely ruined my reputation!""
""No wonder those people at your school are always targeting you. It's because you're so filthy and disgusting yourself, you attract all the flies!""
After his tirade, Mr. Carter threw a plane ticket in front of Chloe.
""I've booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get as far away as you can and never come back!""
Chloe picked up the plane ticket from the floor, her fingers trembling slightly, as if it were a verdict sentencing her to be completely abandoned by the world.
Her father found her disgraceful and wanted her to leave.
Just as well, she didn't want to stay anymore either.
""I'll go.""
Chloe's tone was calm. ""And I'll do as you say. I'll never come back.""
Mr. Carter was stunned, thinking he had misheard.
He had arranged for Serena to study abroad and tried to persuade Chloe to go with her, but Chloe refused. Only after repeated questioning did he learn that she was in dating and was head over heels in love.
He thought Chloe would refuse again.
But he didn't expect her to agree so readily this time.
Mr. Carter's anger subsided a little, and he said coldly:
""Serena is coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome-home banquet for her, and you'll be there too.""
""The video is already out. If you don't show up, it will only confirm all the rumors.""
Chloe nodded, ""I know.""
...
Chloe took three days off from school.
She spent those three days packing up everything Liam had ever given her and sold them all online for the original price.
Three days later, Serena returned from abroad.
Mr. Carter threw a welcome-home banquet for her at the biggest hotel in Los Angeles, inviting all the big names in the business world.
That included Liam.
Chloe didn't expect to run into Liam there. As she turned to leave, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a deserted corner.
Liam pinned her against the wall, his hands firmly planted on either side of her, his hot breath fanning against her ear.
""You haven't been to school these past few days, you're not answering my messages, and you were silent even on our anniversary.""
""Chloe, you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
His eyes were locked on her, clearly unhappy about her disappearance.
Chloe pressed her lips together, mustering the courage to meet Liam's gaze. ""So, Liam actually worries about an insignificant sex buddy?""
The usually docile and obedient Chloe suddenly showing a temper surprised Liam a little.
A rebellious feeling surged through him, and he yanked Chloe closer, his arm wrapping tightly around her waist.
""Sex buddy?""
""Once in two years, and you call that a relationship only with sex?""
Chloe didn't know what had gotten into Liam, as he grabbed her chin and was about to kiss her.
Just then, a voice sounded nearby.
""Liam, you are here. Serena's looking for you.""
Liam frowned slightly, let go of Chloe, and said to the person, ""Got it, I'll be right there.""
Chloe pretended to be surprised and asked Liam, ""You know my sister?""
""Know her? Their relationship is more exciting than you think.""
Liam's friend had a teasing look on his face. ""Chloe, just you wait. You will be shocked.""
After the two had walked away, a flash of mockery crossed Chloe's eyes.
These people thought she was still in the dark, planning to stage a grand humiliation for her today.
But they didn't know she had already composed herself, ready to make a clean break with Liam.
As the banquet was in full swing, the lights went out.
An instant later, a spotlight hit the stage, revealing a sharply dressed Liam with Serena, who was in a white gown, on his arm.
Mr. Carter, beaming, raised his hand for silence and announced loudly:
""I've invited you all here today for two reasons: first, to welcome Serena home from her studies, and second, to announce some good news.""
""The Carter and Sterling families are friends for generations, and years ago, we arranged a marriage for Serena and Liam.""
""Now, they are deeply in love, and the formal engagement banquet will be held at the end of the month. I hope you will all come to witness their happiness!""
​
After Mr. Carter finished speaking, Liam's friends all turned to look at Chloe, waiting to enjoy the sight of her breaking down.
But Chloe just stood quietly in the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Liam frowned slightly.
In his mind, Chloe was supposed to lose control when she found out about his relationship with Serena.
But right now, she was a little too calm.
A strange restlessness stirred in Liam's heart. Serena, sensing something was off, quickly asked, ""Liam, what's wrong?""
Liam subtly averted his gaze. ""It's nothing. I just zoned out for a second.""
He knew very well that Chloe's feelings for him ran deep; it was impossible for her to have no reaction.
She was just putting on a brave face.
...
Chloe went to the restroom and splashed her face hard with cold water.
Thinking back on her past infatuation with Liam, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had only touched her once in two years.
It wasn't because he cherished her, but because he couldn't even be bothered to touch her.
And the first sex she had always treasured was, to him, just perfect material to ruin her reputation.
Just as Chloe returned to the banquet hall, Mr. Carter called her over.
""Chloe, come here. This is your brother-in-law.""
Chloe walked up to Liam, a perfect smile playing on her lips. ""Brother-in-law.""
Hearing the words ""brother-in-law,"" Liam's expression tightened.
But Serena didn't seem to notice, smiling brightly. ""Chloe, I just heard that Liam is on the board of directors at your school. What a coincidence! If you run into any trouble in the future, just ask your brother-in-law for help. After all, we're all family.""
Chloe gritted her teeth and said, word by word, ""I won't cause my brother-in-law any trouble.""
She didn't look at Liam's face, but she could feel his piercing gaze, like a freezing wind in the dead of winter, making her tremble.
After a few simple pleasantries, Chloe prepared to leave.
But Serena stepped forward and took her arm, feigning intimacy. ""Chloe, we haven't seen each other in so long. I have so much I want to tell you.""
Without another word, she dragged Chloe to a lounge.
The moment the door closed, Serena dropped her smile, her expression turning cold and sinister.
""Chloe, I heard you slept with Liam, and the video is all over the place. Did you think you could cling to hm with such a cheap trick?""
""Let me tell you the truth. He doesn't like you at all. Not only does he not like you, he's utterly disgusted by you!""
""I asked him to spread the rumor that your mom was the mistress. I told him to pursue you. I just wanted to watch you fall in love with him, only to be destroyed by him personally!""
Chapter 4
Chapter 4
Chloe: ""Why?""
""Why?
Because you have no shame, of course. Your mom's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to the Carter family's things?""
""All of that was supposed to be mine! What right do you, the daughter of a mistress, have to enjoy the Carter family's wealth and luxury!""
Chloe could tolerate anything, but she could not tolerate her mother being insulted.
She lunged in front of Serena, her voice squeezed through her teeth:
""My mother was not the mistress. When she married my father, she didn't know he has married your mother.""
""It's you! Drove her to death!!""
Serena hadn't expected Chloe to talk back to her, and raised her hand to slap her.
Just then, the door to the lounge was pushed open.
Catching sight of Liam, Serena quickly grabbed some nut pastries from the table and stuffed them into her mouth.
The next moment, she went limp and collapsed, mumbling, ""Chloe, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Liam rushed over to Serena and pushed Chloe away.
Chloe stumbled backward, her back hitting the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the coffee table shattered, and Chloe's hands were pierced by the shards, dripping with blood.
​
Liam didn't even glance at her. He quickly knelt and pulled Serena into his arms.
""Serena, are you okay?""
With tears in her eyes, Serena helplessly grabbed Liam's arm. ""I just wanted to catch up with Chloe. I don't know what I did to offend her, but she just forced me to eat those pastries...""
""Look at me, am I breaking out in a rash?""
Liam looked down and saw large red hives rapidly breaking out all over Serena's skin.
""What should I do?
The banquet isn't over yet. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... yes, I need to cover it with makeup!""
Liam gripped Serena's wrist tightly. ""How can you be thinking about that now?
Come on, I'm taking you to the hospital.""
Liam picked Serena up, and before leaving, he shot Chloe a cold glare.
Fighting through the intense pain, Chloe struggled to her feet. Blood gushed from her hands, instantly staining the hem of her dress red.
But she couldn't feel the pain. It was as if all her senses had been stripped away the moment she fell into a bottomless abyss.
She called for a server to bring a first-aid kit and shakily managed to bandage her wounds.
Exhausted from the ordeal, Chloe dragged her feet, preparing to leave.
Just as she entered the hallway, several figures lunged out and dragged her into a nearby storage room without a word.
Then, a large hand gripped her chin hard, forcing her to look up as highly concentrated Chili Oil was poured into her mouth.
Chloe's eyes widened in terror.
Like Serena, she had allergies, and she was born allergic to chili peppers.
This much Chili Oil was enough to kill her!
""Mmph... let...""
Chloe struggled desperately.
But the men gave her no chance to resist, pouring cup after cup of Chili Oil down her throat.
She choked, her face turning beet red, and her body began to convulse violently. Her injured hands clawed feebly at the floor, making an unsettling sound.
Instead of stopping when they saw her wretched state, the men only grew more vicious, hurling insults at her:
""Serena is the woman Liam treasures. You dare to lay a hand on her? Who the hell do you think you are?""
""I heard you got bullied a lot in school. You must be completely used up by all kinds of guys by now. A man with standards as high as Liam would never want a filthy slut like you.""
""Just drink all this Chili Oil. Consider it an apology to Serena. Or else, we'll make you suffer!""
Chloe's vision grew increasingly blurry, and her consciousness began to fade.
She used the last of her strength, almost unconsciously murmuring that person's name, ""Liam...""
The moment she spoke, a piercing laugh came from above her.
""Hahaha!
You don't actually expect Liam to come save you, do you?""
""He told us to pour this Chili Oil on you. You hurt Serena, he'd be happy if you were dead!""
""Come on, let's rip her clothes off, take pictures, and send them to Liam. Let him get some satisfaction too!""
Several men swarmed her, tearing Chloe's dress to shreds in an instant.
They frantically took pictures of the barely breathing, disheveled Chloe until she couldn't hold on any longer and passed out completely.

He suffered a medical event that landed him in the hospital just before radiation was supposed to start and stayed in the hospital from January 21st until February 24th.  When he was finally discharged home, he moved in with me and my young family so he could complete his chemo/radiation treatments.  

When he first got here, he required help with everything (stairs, showers, dressing, toilet, etc.), but since February, he has managed to get stronger and gain his weight back.  He is still living with us, is back to almost pre-diagnosis weight, and is able to dress, shower, and make quick meals (cereal or heating up leftovers) on his own.  I'm so proud of him for the progress he's made, but now he's dealing with a lot of residual pain that is likely radiation neuropathy and/or damage that was done by the cancer itself.

He has visited pain management and was given gabapentin, and the idea of physical therapy was introduced, but he refused it pretty immediately and wouldn't even consider it.  Now he is living in my home, and basically just sits here all day.  When we have mentioned that some of his pain may be due to weakness and muscle loss, he rejects the idea and claims that he has ALWAYS had this pain, but now it is just constant and the only relief comes with sitting with his back against a chair or the bed.

With all this being said, he manages to come downstairs in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, his cellphone, and a big hardback book and go out to our garage to smoke cigarettes.  He'll sit out there for an hour or two, coming in once or twice to get a cup of coffee, and then go back out to sit in the garage.  When he comes inside, he sits on my couch and reads his book or scrolls his phone.  At some point, he'll get up and go to the kitchen to make a bowl of cereal and grab his meds, but then back to the couch he goes.  From about 7 a.m. until about 5 p.m., he moves between the couch to the garage 4 or 5 times to sit and smoke.  Then he goes upstairs to lay in the bed and waits for me to bring him dinner and his nighttime medications.

He only showers once a week.  He stays in pajamas everyday unless he has an appointment, which lately has only been once every 4 weeks for immunotherapy.  He might get dressed to go to the library to pick out books, but otherwise its pajamas and sitting.  He will drive his truck if I insist on it, and he does a pretty good job, but most of the time he wants me to drive him.  When he does drive, he can make it from our home to the library about 15-20 minutes away, walk around the library for about 5 minutes, and then drive back to the house.  I know that being on his feet for longer than a couple of minutes is very uncomfortable for him, but he IS able to do it.  So at this point he can shower himself, dress himself, toilet on his own, make small/quick meals without assistance, and drive his truck - he just can't be on his feet longer than a few minutes or he is in pain.  The pain subsides once he sits back down.  And his description of it is an intense burning sensation, which COULD be nerve pain, but also sounds like the burning you might experience from overuse of a weak muscle.

I have asked him several times what he wishes to do with the rest of his life because sitting on my couch isn't LIVING, its just EXISTING.  He says he doesn't know what he wants to do - and he can't do ANYTHING until he figures out this pain in his shoulder blade.  We have spoken to his oncologist and his pain management team, and they have both stated that he will likely never be pain-free, but that he can take gabapentin for the nerve pain for now, and possibly see physical therapy.  He will not agree to physical therapy, no matter how many times it is suggested.  

At this point, I feel like I have done everything in my power to get him through the very worst of his treatment.  The things that I do for him recently aren't NEEDED, its just something I do now because he's here and I feel obligated to.  I often get the feeling that I am enabling him to just sit and get weaker and weaker, when what he NEEDS is to do many of these things for himself.  Also, he is very insular, so he doesn't really interact with us.  When you TRY to interact with him, he often ignores you, or cuts you off mid-sentence because he's not that interested.  He has taken over one of the bedrooms of my home, the kids bathroom, and now our family room.  My girls spend much of their time at other people's homes, or in their own bedrooms, because he's always sitting in our family room.  My husband spends all his free time at home just sitting in our basement.  And I just feel like I'm constantly on edge and anxious - trying and failing to manage the emotions of everyone around me.  

I can tell that my kids running in and out of our house makes dad anxious.  I can tell that the fact that my husband isn't super handy around the house annoys him.  When he is in our garage smoking, he only opens the garage door about 6 inches - so if my kids open the garage door to get their bikes or roller skates or scooters, he snaps at them to close the garage door back.  My dog barking when the doorbell rings annoys him - and our doorbell rings constantly because the neighborhood kids are always looking for my girls.  The fact that the kids pull the garden hose out and don't put it back annoys him.  Their shoes and backpacks laying all over the place annoys him and he'll bark at them to put their stuff away.  But this is THEIR house, not his. He asked if he could live with us during his treatment, but now his treatment is pretty much complete, and he's just settled in. My husband and I don't care that the kids are rowdy, or that their shoes and backpacks are piled up by the door, or that they go in and out a hundred times when they're playing.... it just doesn't bother us.  But it bothers dad - and it always has.  Even when I was a kid, dad was kind of a killjoy.

So, his presence in my home keeps me in a constant state of anxiety because I know that he is going to say something to me about the kids or the dog or whatever.  And the fact that my anxiety is rubbing off on my husband and kids is depressing to me.  I've tried to broach the subject with dad gently, but it never seems to land the way I want it to, and nothing seems to change.  Today something was different in my demeanor, and it just seemed to amplify everything by 100. 

I woke up anxious - as soon as my eyes opened, I was amped.  I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee - I always set the pot the night before to auto-brew at 6:30 a.m.  I realized at 11 p.m. last night that I only had enough regular coffee for a half pot, so I added in a couple scoops of some vanilla flavored coffee just so we could have a full pot this morning.  I went to let my dog out, and dad was on the couch.  He didn't even say good morning, he said ""Did you do something different to the coffee?""  I told him about the vanilla flavored coffee and he scrunched up his face and said ""Well I don't like it."" I said sorry, it was all we had until I got to the store later.

I went downstairs to find my husband, and as usual he was working on our small business in the office.  I sat down at the desk to start on my daily tasks, and he could tell right away that something was wrong so he asked me about it... but nothing had really HAPPENED, so I just told him that I was just amped this morning and didn't know why.  A little while later, our youngest came barreling in from a sleepover she'd had at the neighbors house.  She brought the neighbor friend back with her.  My husband and I are fine with that, but I could hear dad upstairs barking at them to close the door and take off their shoes and put their stuff away.  In my head, I thought ""This is HER house, not yours."" But I couldn't make myself go upstairs and actually say it to him.

A little while later, my husband went out to cut the grass and the steering on our lawnmower broke.  No big deal, we'll get the repair guy to fix it.  Dad asked me what was wrong and I told him, and he said something snarky like ""It probably just needs a new plate. He could fix it himself in an afternoon. If you'd tell that repair guy to look at EVERYTHING instead of just the thing that's broken, he might catch this stuff before it breaks - but you won't tell him that.""  I was annoyed, but I held my tongue.  I should have said ""Why would we spend an afternoon fixing it when we know someone who can do it?""  But I didn't say what I was thinking, I just kept my mouth shut.  Then he headed to the garage and fussed because the garage door had been left open and now it was cold in the garage.  And I thought to myself,  ""we left it open because the lawnmower is still outside,"" but I didn't say anything, I just kept my mouth shut.

My husband gets aggravated because I don't speak up or talk back when dad gets an attitude - but he's my dad and I was trained my whole life to respect him and to not talk back to him.  I'm finding it pretty impossible to stand up for myself and my family as long as dad is here - so I've reached a point where my house no longer feels like mine, it feels like its dads, and we're just an inconvenient annoyance to him.  But dad isn't paying our mortgage.  And he's not paying utilities.  He might cover groceries now and then, but thats about it.  I don't owe him ANYTHING, but I cannot seem to speak my mind.

When dad came in from the garage, after fussing because we'd left the garage door open, I was silently seething.  He noticed it and said ""Are you mad at me?""  And honestly, no, I'm not MAD at him.  But I AM frustrated with him.  But I find it so hard to just SAY THAT.  So I said, no, I'm just stressed out.  He told me that I needed to go sit down and relax.  BUT I CAN'T RELAX.

I went back to the office in the basement and sat down, but I was so BESIDE MYSELF with anxiety and just pent-up frustration, that I started to cry - just silent tears rolling down my face.  Not because I was sad, but because I'm so anxious and frustrated at the current state of my life.  My husband clocked it immediately, but he's frustrated, too, so he said something a little snarky, then said he was going to take a shower.  I sat there for a minute with my head in my hands and then before I knew it, I was up on my feet and heading up the stairs to the family room.

I sat down in front of dad and said ""You asked me earlier if I was mad at you - and I'm NOT mad, but I just don't know what to do anymore.""  I went on to tell him managing the day to day of everybody while all of us are living in the same house was kind of breaking me and I didn't know how to fix it.  He piped up and said ""I'll start doing more for myself.""  But I steamrolled through and told him that I was just getting so burnt out and frustrated.  But everything I mentioned, he would refute. When I said that my house doesn't feel like my own anymore, and he said he'd stay in his room and not take over the shared spaces anymore.  When I mentioned getting him an apartment, he said that if he lived on his own, it would be a ""death sentence"" for him.  When I mentioned going back to his girlfriend's place, he said he ""had to get rid of this pain first"" before he goes back there. When I mentioned that the pain likely would never go away, and he should go to physical therapy, he said ""I'm not going to physical therapy so they can beat me up and make my pain worse."" 

He went on to say that when he lived in a single bedroom apartment, he wasn't eating well, or sleeping well, and that he was smoking and drinking too much, and that it wasn't good for him.  So I told him that maybe we could split the difference - and I mentioned the independent living complex that is literally 5 minutes from my house.  He shook his head defiantly and said he wasn't going there.  I went on to say that he wouldn't be completely by himself, there would be people around that are his age and have similar interests, and they also have everything he needs right there on site.  He shook his head again and said he wasn't doing that.  He said that we can have our family room back whenever we want and he'd just find someplace else to hide out in our house - but I told him that it wasn't healthy for him to sit alone in his bedroom all day, either.  He expressed that he knows that I've been doing more for him than I need to, and he would do better.  I told him that I'm having a hard time separating it, because as long as he's here, I can't separate myself from doing things for him that he could do for himself.  

I asked if going back to his girlfriend's house was something that he WISHED to do and he said ""yes, eventually- but not full-time.""  I told him that I think that sitting here in my house without any interaction makes him hyper-focus on his pain, because on days when he's distracted by appointments or outings, he doesn't seem to have terrible, unbearable pain.  I reiterated that the independent living facility would be good for him because there are people there who he would share common interests with, but he kept shaking his head no.  

In one 15 minute conversation, he said that being alone in an apartment was a death sentence for him, but being in an independent living complex around other people his own age just wouldn't work.  I don't feel like anything I said to him actually LANDED.  And I wasn't forceful enough to make him understand that him living HERE isn't WORKING for me or my family.

The only good thing that came out of the conversation today is that now he knows I'm burnt out and stressed out, and that I wish to reclaim my home for myself and my family.  But I don't think he truly HEARD the underlying sentiment, which was ""you can't stay here.""  I think I will eventually be strong enough to say those actual words, but today I just let him know that I'm reaching the emd of my rope.  Again, as always, I was too timid to actually say the words, but I do feel like the conversation today has laid the groundwork for me to relinquish control of his life BACK TO HIM.  At the beginning of the year, my constant involvement in his affairs was necessary - but even though I acknowledge that he still needs my support in some aspects of his life, it has become evident that he COULD function safely in his own place.  

I am prepared to still accompany him to his appointments, or run through the grocery or pharmacy for him - but otherwise, I think he NEEDS to be independent again.  And if he moved into the independent living apartment, we'd be less than a 5 minute drive away - so he could come hang out here if he wants, or we could get to him quickly if he needed us.  

I'm hoping that today's conversation was a soft-start into getting our lives back - both him AND me.  I just have to keep speaking my mind when issues present themselves.",3,1762665259.0,CaregiverSupport,0,1.0,False
1osatr8,https://i.redd.it/aoc4cnkqv50g1.jpeg,Hermes Mobile Unit,"I spend months a year away from home, so although I own a few 100ml bottles, travel sprays just fit better into my life. I've got a ton of them, but this is most of my current collection of Hermes travel sprays. I've been wearing Terre d'Hermes since the late 2000s, and over the past 2 years or so, I have really tried to branch out and explore the house more deeply. From the left: 

Terre d'Hermes Pure Parfum 12.5ml: It's such a calming take on the TdH DNA that I take it when I know I'll have to make a stressful presentation or something. It is my ""power through it"" fragrance. I recently finished my 15ml bottle. This little 12.5ml is cuter (and better to place on a shelf). 

Terre d'Hermes Eau de Parfum Intense 15ml: I just got this one a couple of weeks ago! I never thought I would see the day a fragrance with licorice and coffee in its notes would somehow manage to smell fresh, but here we are. Christine Nagel really surprised me with this one.

Terre d'Hermes Eau Givree 15ml: This is my second travel spray of Eau Givree. It's the mineralic side of TdH blended with a cool yuzu-juniper cocktail. One of the best summer fragrances available. It's quite deservedly popular.

Terre d'Hermes Eau Intense Vetiver 15ml: This was the one I was slowest to warm up to, mainly because I am quite sensitive to the superambers that linger after the middle notes wear off. It is the most austere version of TdH, with a profile that situates it more in line with classics like Guerlain Vetiver and Tom Ford Grey Vetiver, but with a rougher citrus that shares a lot in common with Eau de Citron Noir. I've grown to appreciate it.

Terre d'Hermes EdT 15ml: This is my third(!) travel spray of TdH, and I'm also coincidentally on my third full bottle. This one goes on every trip with me. Needs no further introduction. My desert island fragrance.

Eau des Merveilles Bleue 15ml: This is one I finally picked up after smelling it in the store probably 10 times. It takes Christine Nagel's salt accord from Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt and lasers in on it. The effect is like an idealized memory of breathing salty air on the beach, with none of the seaweed and unpleasantness.

Voyage de Hermes Edt 15ml: This is one of the few fragrances I will wear on a flight (and even then, just a spray). It is a light, crisp, soapy cardamom that almost doesn't feel like a fragrance at all. It was intended for travelers, and as such, it evokes the nicest aspects of traveling.

H24 EdT 15ml: I actually prefer the Herbes Vives flanker due to its cooling qualities, but there is something special about this one, too: It's got a nice clary sage bite mixed with what I would describe as a pear in a steam room. The drydown is very ambroxan-heavy, which I enjoy as well. 

H24 Herbes Vives 12.5ml: I have the full bottle of this one, and I was able to procure this endearing little 12.5ml for trips. This is one of the first fragrances to include an aromachemical called PhysCool that hints at coolness without smelling mentholated; the result is that this fragrance evokes a cool, misty jungle. 

Not pictured: I've also got a travel spray of Le Jardin sur la Nil (which is a masterpiece), but my wife is traveling with it at the moment. 

My next Hermes purchase (well, more accurately, it will be a Christmas gift) will be travel sprays of four of the Hermessences, and your input would be highly appreciated here.

**Are you open to refurbs/used?** 

No

**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** 

All metal body strongly preferred. 2 in one or ultra book would be nice. I would like good battery life, 6-8 hours battery life on light browsing or short spreadsheets?

Quite important. I have a desktop already, I want something I can easily grab and move to the kitchen for recipes or toss up on the coffee table for research, or throw on my lap. 

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

14-15""

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

Really just browsing the web or excel. Maybe some occasional word processing. 

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

I might grind some OSRS if I get really bored, but I have a powerful gaming desktop with 3 monitors I don't really need this to game.

Chapter 1
The biggest bombshell of the year at the Ivy League university was that the first sex tape of Chloe from the art department was posted in the campus group chat.
The video was shot in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
Chloe was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a head taller than her, the intimate rhythmic sounds non-stop.
When it was over, the man whispered in her ear, ""Good girl.""
Those two simple words were like a bombshell, causing a huge uproar in the group chat.
[That voice... could it be Liam?]
[Chloe really has her ways, managing to hook up with our school's trustee!
No wonder her bullies haven't been bothering her anymore.]
[I always thought Chloe was some innocent girl, but it turns out she's a scheming bitch. Just what you'd expect from a mistress's daughter!]
When the news reached Chloe, she was in her dorm room knitting a scarf for Liam.
Her roommate turned the video's volume to max, passing the phone around with a sneer, deliberately drawing out her words:
""Chloe, you sound so skilled. You must have done many times, huh?""
Laughter erupted around her. Chloe froze, her face pale, the half-finished scarf slipping from her hands as she got up and bolted out the door.
She stumbled towards Liam's office, wanting to ask him what the video was all about.
But as soon as she got to the door, she heard mocking voices from inside.
""Liam, you really showed Chloe no mercy. You deliberately made sure her face was so clear. She doesn't even have a chance to clear her name.""
Hearing this, Chloe's mind went blank, and a chill instantly spread through her entire body.
""Well, it's her own fault for pissing off the woman Liam love most. She deserves it.""
""It was just tough on our Liam, having to spread rumors about Chloe's mother being the mistress, and then playing the savior to deal with her bullies, acting all in love in front of her.""
""By the way, Liam, when are you going to tell her the truth?
If she finds out the guy she's liked for so long is actually her future brother-in-law, she'll probably cry herself out on the spot, hahaha...""
Liam, lounging on the sofa, tapped the ash from his cigarette on the edge of the ashtray, his expression unreadable.
Seeing him silent, his buddy next to him quickly asked, ""Feeling sorry for her?
Back then, she went to great lengths to send Serena abroad for two whole years, leaving her to starve and freeze. I can't just let her get away with it!""
Hearing Serena's name, Liam finally reacted.
He stubbed out his cigarette and said flatly, ""Wait until Serena returns.""
""That day also happens to be an anniversary Chloe has been looking forward to for a long time. I'll give her a 'surprise' and make her pay back everything she owes Serena.""
Chloe's breath caught. Her gaze cut through the smoke to Liam's cold, stern face, and she felt as if her heart had been ripped open, the pain so intense her vision went blurred.
So it was Liam who spread all those rumors slandering her mother!
Liam pursued her and protected her, all just for revenge.
The person he truly loves is her half-sister, Serena.
Chloe couldn't bear to hear any more and turned to flee in a panic.
But she hadn't gone more than a few steps when a group of women blocked her path.
""Well, well, the girl in that explicit video?!""
""Just came from the office? Couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""
Chloe's face was pale as she tried to get away, but the group just pushed her back and forth.
Just then, Liam's icy voice came from behind her—
""You dare touch Chloe right under my nose? Do you have a death wish?""
Liam had left the office at some point, and his tall, imposing figure was now strolling toward them.
The girls scattered the moment they saw Liam.
Liam came to Chloe's side, reached out to smooth her disheveled hair, and as he leaned down to look into her eyes, he gently caressed her cheek with his thumb.
""Didn't I tell you? If anyone bullies you again, just drop my name.""
The familiar smell of tobacco filled her nose, stinging her eyes and making them burn.
The Liam before her now merged with the memory of the man who had protected her so many times, feeling like an old dream.
After her mother's suicide, her father got back together with his first love, leaving her to live a life that was worse than an orphan's.
Later, rumors flew around school that her mother was a mistress, and that Serena was the true, legitimate daughter of the Carter family.
As ""a mistress's daughter,"" she was inevitably bullied.
It was Liam who rescued her from her misery. Using his position on the school board, he effortlessly carved out a safe haven for her.
Yesterday was Liam's birthday, and emboldened by alcohol, they slept together. He dropped his usual elegant and refined facade, forcefully pinning her against the bare floor-to-ceiling window, watching her body tremble with nervousness.
As Liam claimed her, Chloe felt like a long-lost bird finally returning to its nest.
Little did she know, her return to the nest was built on one scheme after another.
Chloe was in a daze.
By the time she snapped out of it, Liam had already led her out of the office building and she was in the passenger seat of his car.
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
Liam leaned over to fasten her seatbelt as usual. Noticing her red-rimmed eyes, he said softly, ""The video was an accident. I'll handle it. You're not yourself today, I'll take you home so you can rest.""
Chloe bit her lip. As she recalled his words in the office, tears began to fall uncontrollably.
Liam froze for a second, then raised his hand to wipe her tears. A moment later, as if remembering something, he opened his door and said, ""Wait here, I'm going to buy something.""
The door closed, and only then did Chloe realize Liam had taken the wrong phone.
His phone was in the slot by the armrest, and on a strange impulse, Chloe picked it up and typed Serena's birthday as the password.
The phone unlocked, and Chloe saw Serena's name in the pinned chats on WhatsApp.
In their recent chat history, Serena asked him if he could end their relationship with her before she returned to the country.
Liam replied: Just a plaything, I never wanted to be with her.
Chloe's heart clenched, and fighting back the sting in her nose, she kept scrolling up.
During the two years Serena was abroad, Liam called her every single day without fail, always around eight in the evening.
This was also the time he claimed to have board meetings, telling Chloe not to disturb him no matter what.
On top of that, he would transfer money to Serena every month, amounts as high as six figures, so straightforward that there was never even a memo.
Serena was also very good at being cute, occasionally sending a few selfies looking for praise, and Liam would reply with cute emoji Chloe had never seen before, reminding her not to wear too little and catch a cold.
Looking at these chat logs, Chloe finally understood that she had never really known Liam at all.
The tenderness and consideration he showed was just the tip of the iceberg of his overwhelming love for Serena.
When Liam returned to the car, he placed a box of morning-after pills in her hand.
Liam gently stroked the top of her head and said in an incredibly gentle tone, ""Last night was a bit rushed, I wasn't careful. Take this, just in case.""
Chloe clutched the pill box tightly in her hands, biting her lip so hard it almost bled.
If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she would probably still be foolishly thinking that Liam genuinely had her best interests at heart.
Now, she was wide awake.
After the car stopped in front of the villa, Liam leaned in to kiss her goodbye out of habit, but Chloe dodged his kiss and fumbled to unbuckle her seatbelt.
The man's eyes darkened, and he forcefully pulled her into his arms.
""Still upset about the video?""
""...""
""I didn't record the video, and the hotel manager has already been fired.""
Liam lifted her chin, ""Chloe, I never meant to hurt you, and I never will.
Our anniversary is coming up soon, and I'll make it up to you properly then.""
Lies disguised as kindness are often more hurtful than the truth.
Chloe's nose stung, and she pushed Liam away, saying, ""I'm going inside.""
She practically ran into the villa.
But as soon as she got through the door, she ran right into Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter's face was grim, and before Chloe could speak, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.
""Chloe, I really underestimated you. Dating is acceptable, but you even made that kind of indecent video—you've completely ruined my reputation!""
""No wonder those people at your school are always targeting you. It's because you're so filthy and disgusting yourself, you attract all the flies!""
After his tirade, Mr. Carter threw a plane ticket in front of Chloe.
""I've booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get as far away as you can and never come back!""
Chloe picked up the plane ticket from the floor, her fingers trembling slightly, as if it were a verdict sentencing her to be completely abandoned by the world.
Her father found her disgraceful and wanted her to leave.
Just as well, she didn't want to stay anymore either.
""I'll go.""
Chloe's tone was calm. ""And I'll do as you say. I'll never come back.""
Mr. Carter was stunned, thinking he had misheard.
He had arranged for Serena to study abroad and tried to persuade Chloe to go with her, but Chloe refused. Only after repeated questioning did he learn that she was in dating and was head over heels in love.
He thought Chloe would refuse again.
But he didn't expect her to agree so readily this time.
Mr. Carter's anger subsided a little, and he said coldly:
""Serena is coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome-home banquet for her, and you'll be there too.""
""The video is already out. If you don't show up, it will only confirm all the rumors.""
Chloe nodded, ""I know.""
...
Chloe took three days off from school.
She spent those three days packing up everything Liam had ever given her and sold them all online for the original price.
Three days later, Serena returned from abroad.
Mr. Carter threw a welcome-home banquet for her at the biggest hotel in Los Angeles, inviting all the big names in the business world.
That included Liam.
Chloe didn't expect to run into Liam there. As she turned to leave, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a deserted corner.
Liam pinned her against the wall, his hands firmly planted on either side of her, his hot breath fanning against her ear.
""You haven't been to school these past few days, you're not answering my messages, and you were silent even on our anniversary.""
""Chloe, you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
His eyes were locked on her, clearly unhappy about her disappearance.
Chloe pressed her lips together, mustering the courage to meet Liam's gaze. ""So, Liam actually worries about an insignificant sex buddy?""
The usually docile and obedient Chloe suddenly showing a temper surprised Liam a little.
A rebellious feeling surged through him, and he yanked Chloe closer, his arm wrapping tightly around her waist.
""Sex buddy?""
""Once in two years, and you call that a relationship only with sex?""
Chloe didn't know what had gotten into Liam, as he grabbed her chin and was about to kiss her.
Just then, a voice sounded nearby.
""Liam, you are here. Serena's looking for you.""
Liam frowned slightly, let go of Chloe, and said to the person, ""Got it, I'll be right there.""
Chloe pretended to be surprised and asked Liam, ""You know my sister?""
""Know her? Their relationship is more exciting than you think.""
Liam's friend had a teasing look on his face. ""Chloe, just you wait. You will be shocked.""
After the two had walked away, a flash of mockery crossed Chloe's eyes.
These people thought she was still in the dark, planning to stage a grand humiliation for her today.
But they didn't know she had already composed herself, ready to make a clean break with Liam.
As the banquet was in full swing, the lights went out.
An instant later, a spotlight hit the stage, revealing a sharply dressed Liam with Serena, who was in a white gown, on his arm.
Mr. Carter, beaming, raised his hand for silence and announced loudly:
""I've invited you all here today for two reasons: first, to welcome Serena home from her studies, and second, to announce some good news.""
""The Carter and Sterling families are friends for generations, and years ago, we arranged a marriage for Serena and Liam.""
""Now, they are deeply in love, and the formal engagement banquet will be held at the end of the month. I hope you will all come to witness their happiness!""
​
After Mr. Carter finished speaking, Liam's friends all turned to look at Chloe, waiting to enjoy the sight of her breaking down.
But Chloe just stood quietly in the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Liam frowned slightly.
In his mind, Chloe was supposed to lose control when she found out about his relationship with Serena.
But right now, she was a little too calm.
A strange restlessness stirred in Liam's heart. Serena, sensing something was off, quickly asked, ""Liam, what's wrong?""
Liam subtly averted his gaze. ""It's nothing. I just zoned out for a second.""
He knew very well that Chloe's feelings for him ran deep; it was impossible for her to have no reaction.
She was just putting on a brave face.
...
Chloe went to the restroom and splashed her face hard with cold water.
Thinking back on her past infatuation with Liam, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had only touched her once in two years.
It wasn't because he cherished her, but because he couldn't even be bothered to touch her.
And the first sex she had always treasured was, to him, just perfect material to ruin her reputation.
Just as Chloe returned to the banquet hall, Mr. Carter called her over.
""Chloe, come here. This is your brother-in-law.""
Chloe walked up to Liam, a perfect smile playing on her lips. ""Brother-in-law.""
Hearing the words ""brother-in-law,"" Liam's expression tightened.
But Serena didn't seem to notice, smiling brightly. ""Chloe, I just heard that Liam is on the board of directors at your school. What a coincidence! If you run into any trouble in the future, just ask your brother-in-law for help. After all, we're all family.""
Chloe gritted her teeth and said, word by word, ""I won't cause my brother-in-law any trouble.""
She didn't look at Liam's face, but she could feel his piercing gaze, like a freezing wind in the dead of winter, making her tremble.
After a few simple pleasantries, Chloe prepared to leave.
But Serena stepped forward and took her arm, feigning intimacy. ""Chloe, we haven't seen each other in so long. I have so much I want to tell you.""
Without another word, she dragged Chloe to a lounge.
The moment the door closed, Serena dropped her smile, her expression turning cold and sinister.
""Chloe, I heard you slept with Liam, and the video is all over the place. Did you think you could cling to hm with such a cheap trick?""
""Let me tell you the truth. He doesn't like you at all. Not only does he not like you, he's utterly disgusted by you!""
""I asked him to spread the rumor that your mom was the mistress. I told him to pursue you. I just wanted to watch you fall in love with him, only to be destroyed by him personally!""
Chapter 4
Chapter 4
Chloe: ""Why?""
""Why?
Because you have no shame, of course. Your mom's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to the Carter family's things?""
""All of that was supposed to be mine! What right do you, the daughter of a mistress, have to enjoy the Carter family's wealth and luxury!""
Chloe could tolerate anything, but she could not tolerate her mother being insulted.
She lunged in front of Serena, her voice squeezed through her teeth:
""My mother was not the mistress. When she married my father, she didn't know he has married your mother.""
""It's you! Drove her to death!!""
Serena hadn't expected Chloe to talk back to her, and raised her hand to slap her.
Just then, the door to the lounge was pushed open.
Catching sight of Liam, Serena quickly grabbed some nut pastries from the table and stuffed them into her mouth.
The next moment, she went limp and collapsed, mumbling, ""Chloe, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Liam rushed over to Serena and pushed Chloe away.
Chloe stumbled backward, her back hitting the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the coffee table shattered, and Chloe's hands were pierced by the shards, dripping with blood.
​
Liam didn't even glance at her. He quickly knelt and pulled Serena into his arms.
""Serena, are you okay?""
With tears in her eyes, Serena helplessly grabbed Liam's arm. ""I just wanted to catch up with Chloe. I don't know what I did to offend her, but she just forced me to eat those pastries...""
""Look at me, am I breaking out in a rash?""
Liam looked down and saw large red hives rapidly breaking out all over Serena's skin.
""What should I do?
The banquet isn't over yet. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... yes, I need to cover it with makeup!""
Liam gripped Serena's wrist tightly. ""How can you be thinking about that now?
Come on, I'm taking you to the hospital.""
Liam picked Serena up, and before leaving, he shot Chloe a cold glare.
Fighting through the intense pain, Chloe struggled to her feet. Blood gushed from her hands, instantly staining the hem of her dress red.
But she couldn't feel the pain. It was as if all her senses had been stripped away the moment she fell into a bottomless abyss.
She called for a server to bring a first-aid kit and shakily managed to bandage her wounds.
Exhausted from the ordeal, Chloe dragged her feet, preparing to leave.
Just as she entered the hallway, several figures lunged out and dragged her into a nearby storage room without a word.
Then, a large hand gripped her chin hard, forcing her to look up as highly concentrated Chili Oil was poured into her mouth.
Chloe's eyes widened in terror.
Like Serena, she had allergies, and she was born allergic to chili peppers.
This much Chili Oil was enough to kill her!
""Mmph... let...""
Chloe struggled desperately.
But the men gave her no chance to resist, pouring cup after cup of Chili Oil down her throat.
She choked, her face turning beet red, and her body began to convulse violently. Her injured hands clawed feebly at the floor, making an unsettling sound.
Instead of stopping when they saw her wretched state, the men only grew more vicious, hurling insults at her:
""Serena is the woman Liam treasures. You dare to lay a hand on her? Who the hell do you think you are?""
""I heard you got bullied a lot in school. You must be completely used up by all kinds of guys by now. A man with standards as high as Liam would never want a filthy slut like you.""
""Just drink all this Chili Oil. Consider it an apology to Serena. Or else, we'll make you suffer!""
Chloe's vision grew increasingly blurry, and her consciousness began to fade.
She used the last of her strength, almost unconsciously murmuring that person's name, ""Liam...""
The moment she spoke, a piercing laugh came from above her.
""Hahaha!
You don't actually expect Liam to come save you, do you?""
""He told us to pour this Chili Oil on you. You hurt Serena, he'd be happy if you were dead!""
""Come on, let's rip her clothes off, take pictures, and send them to Liam. Let him get some satisfaction too!""
Several men swarmed her, tearing Chloe's dress to shreds in an instant.
They frantically took pictures of the barely breathing, disheveled Chloe until she couldn't hold on any longer and passed out completely.

1osao3k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osao3k,Cinnamon and ginger cookies (gluten-free),"Today I'm back with another recipe, this time featuring seasonal flavors, the flavors of autumn. I'm sharing some **CINNAMON AND GINGER COOKIES**, which are gluten-free, making them perfect for those who don't eat gluten. I made this recipe with what I had on hand. I took a look in my pantry, saw what I had, and since I wanted some cookies to go with my coffee, I decided to make them.

The base for these cookies was oat flour and cornstarch. I already had oat flour at home, and I really don't like using it for drinks or porridge; for those kinds of recipes, I prefer rolled oats, so I decided to use it for this. That said, let's get to my recipe.



# THE RECIPE / LA RECETA



**Time, ingredients and equipment**

* Preparation time: The recipe requires approximately 20 minutes for mixing, and baking time is 20-30 minutes per batch (this varies depending on the oven), so the total approximate time will be 1 hour and 20 minutes.
* Servings: 25 medium cookies and 10 small cookies. This will depend on the cookie cutter you use. The total weight of the cookies is approximately 200 grams.

**The ingredient quantities listed below can be varied according to availability and personal preference. Be creative!**

* 100 grams of oat flour. If you don't have oat flour, simply grind rolled oats into a powder.
* 75 grams of cornstarch.
* 1 tablespoon of cornstarch for rolling out the dough.
* 3 heaped tablespoons of grated piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar).
* 1 chia egg (1 tablespoon of chia seeds + 3 tablespoons of hot water).
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 50 ml water
* 50 ml neutral-flavored oil. I used corn oil (you can use whatever you have at home).
* Baking sheet, parchment paper, rolling pin, teaspoon, bowl, measuring cup, etc.



# THE PROCEDURE

  
Prepare the chia egg (add hot water to the chia seeds and let them hydrate for 20 minutes). Place the grated piloncillo in a bowl, gradually add the oat flour, and mix with your hands, trying to integrate both ingredients.

Add the cinnamon and ginger and mix well. Add the chia egg and oil and mix. Then add the water and mix with a spoon until combined. You will obtain a smooth mixture like the one in the photo.  


Next, gradually add the cornstarch. First mix with a spoon, and then with your hands. Knead briefly until you obtain a smooth dough, into which you can press your finger and it comes out clean.

Place the dough on the table, sprinkle with cornstarch, and roll out to a thickness of 0.5 to 0.3 cm (remember, the thinner the dough, the crispier the cookies, yummy!). Cut out the cookies with a cookie cutter and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or one that you have previously greased and floured.

Bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and carefully unmold using a spatula. Let them cool completely and enjoy them on their own or with coffee, juice, or tea. And there you have it, my **CINNAMON AND GINGER COOKIES** are ready! They turned out DELICIOUS. To keep them fresh, you can store them in an airtight jar or container.

I want to emphasize that from the moment I made the dough, the smell of these cookies was delicious, and when I baked them, that smell intensified, filling the whole house with that warm and special aroma. They are crispy cookies with a unique flavor thanks to the spices and piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar). They are truly delicious. I highly recommend them.

**Is it me, or is this problematic?**

**Mood Spoilers:** >!appalling, funny!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/kA6NghmD4z): **October 18, 2025**

**So anyway, here's the original post:**

First, I'd like to say that if I'm wrong, I'll accept it. I'm older, and I know that a lot has changed, even from a few years ago when I got hitched.

**Here's the issue:**

My husband's niece is getting married, and I just learned this 3 days ago. The wedding is on October 31st.

We did not receive an invitation, a text message, a FB or Instagram message, nothing. We heard about it when my partner's parents were here for dinner.

The wedding is at 0830 AM in a town 2 hours from here. The family has rented a huge Air B&B with only 2 bathrooms for the bride, groom, wedding party, and family. We would be sleeping on the sofa. The mother of the bride is offended when I said I'd be getting a hotel (if I go. I mean, we haven't been invited at this point.)

Partner called mother of the bride (his sister). She says there's no dress except ""Dark Academia"" costumes. I own nothing in this aesthetic that fits these days and it's a little late to buy anything.

The venue the couple has chosen DOES NOT ALLOW WEDDINGS, so they have booked it for a ""business meeting,"" even though the bride will show up in long white wedding gown. There's a very real possibility of the entire event getting kicked out of the venue, and the family thinks that would be absolutely hysterically funny.

Am I the crazy one? I don't want any part of this and can think of a dozen things I'd rather do on Halloween than get up early in the morning and get kicked out of a venue. We technically have not received an invite, but the bride's mother was clear that she'll be offended if we don't attend.

I can sit this one out, right?

**Edit:** I just woke up and am a little overwhelmed at how many replies I have. I oromise I will read them all--after coffee.

Briefly, though--the question was ""does this count as an invitation. The overwhelming response is that, even with fairly relaxed rukes arund these things, it doesn't, and that's a huge relief to me.

Secon, several people have asked how my husband feels about this. He seems to think it's perfectly normal. He absolutely lans to attend.

And finally, for the person who said I'm expressing obvious ""disdain"" for the couple--that's not true. I barely know them. I've no problem with a wedding that wants people to come in coatume, and if my brief google search is any indication it's a look I could really get behind. But not in a week and a half. And less you doubt that, hubby's niece attended my wedding in a very cute steampunk/burlesque outfit, and my 80 year old dad wore his old bagpiper's regalia when he walked me down the aisle.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You haven’t been invited? Definitely. If you do get an invitation, just say you already have plans. It’s less than two weeks away.

> **OOP:** It feels so haphazard. Supposedly, today's phone call ""counts"" as an invite, but I'm super disinclined. The mother of the bride isn't the bride, last I heard.

**Commenter 2:** If you don’t want to go, can I?

I don’t know what dark academia is as a dress code but I doubt it’s business casual so how are they going to sneak the wedding party into the non-wedding venue?

Serious answer - you haven’t been invited so no, don’t make plans to go. Or do and live post everything.

> **OOP:** She's going to wear a legit wedding gown! Does she think no one will notice, I wonder? Also, the bride is painfully shy, so I'm confused why she would want this.
> 
> **Commenter 2:** Does she want this? Does she even know? Sounds like her mum/family are the ones doing the planning
>> 
>> **OOP:** She's a remarkably passive person and her mom is....not. I don't know if she's even capable of saying what she wants or needs. She's super shy, so I could see her just going along to ""keep the peace,"" then having a miserable time at her own wedding.
>> 
>> Or, I could be projecting how I would feel.

**Commenter 3:** I mean... you aren't actually invited.

You are hearing details from everyone else who assumes you are... but no invite from the Bride and Groom.

I think that gives you an out.

I'd say, directly to the bride and groom, not continuing the game of telephone with other people. (And bypassing the drama)

""I'm so sorry. I never got an official invite, so I assumed you were keeping it small, like lots of couples do now and didn't think twice about it. I only knew I was invited after ""phone call date"" and, unfortunately have a conflict I cannot get away from. I'm so sorry to miss it. I can't wait to catch up and see all the photos. ""

I'd then send a gift and heartfelt card and happily sit it out.

> **OOP:** Thank you. It's where I'm leaning. I could sleep in, read a book, hand out candy.

**Commenter 4:** This is insane enough that I’m torn between “go just to see the chaos unfold” and “do not even dignify this with a response, let alone consider going.” With that said though, I’m really curious to hear what your husband thinks since it’s his family. Is he planning to go? Or is this entirely up to you? Does he also think this is crazy?

> **OOP:** They are all acting as if this is totally normal. But he says that his sister (mother of bride) also had a ton of drama surrounding her wedding. So maybe they thrive on the chaos. He is definitely going, with or without an invite. I'm leaning towards a peaceful weekend with my cats, and everyone here us 100% validating me!

**Commenter 5:** Everything about this “wedding” sounds nuts. I’d pass. There is no way the venue is going to allow that if they have explicitly stated no weddings.

> **OOP:** For me, thats the worst part. It feels incredibly disrespectful and entitled.

**What is Dark Academia?**

> **OOP:** I googled it, and it's sort of goth meets British school. I'm older, so i guess dressing like I was Wednesday Addams' teacher.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/7MdafRFTJa): **November 2, 2025 (a bit over two weeks later)**

Update to ""Is it me, or is this problematic?""

Here is a link to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/pCboB6tLme

First, you'll have to understand that this is taking place through the lens of my husband, who thinks weddings are boring and that his mother and sister can do no wrong.

I am at the age where an appointment with one's cardiologist takes precedence over nearly anything else. I kept that appointment.

Mother-of-the-bride called at about noon on the 30th to ask if we would be attending the rehearsal dinner. We didn't know there was one. Husband decided to drop everything and go. The family had not selected a restaurant, nor made reservations. They all ended up driving from place to place until they found somewhere able to seat 12 plus a baby, and they ended up at what I consider one of the worst restaurants on the Oregon Coast.

After dinner, MOB and Grandma-of-Bride were affronted that husband had booked a hotel, rather than staying at the air bnb they had booked--where he would have had to sleep on the couch and share a bathroom with 12 other people. (I had a BLT for dinner and watched 2 episodes of Slow Horses with my cat. Very nice.)

Halloween, the entire wedding party and entourage had to get up ungodly early for their ""meeting,"" which was reserved for 0800-1000. It was raining--hard--and the entire party got soaked just getting from the parking lot to the car. There was a total of 14 people there for the ""meeting,"" including the baby--which cried the whole time and was not taken out to the hallway.

The bride wore a tea length black dress, the groom wore a shirt with a collar and chinos. Most guests did not do anything like ""Dark Academia."" I think that's unfortunate, because the bride really wanted that. However, with the short notice, and with the average age of guests being well over 60, I'm not surprised. (Love the look. I think I could really get into it.)

The ceremony was brief and was followed by a buffet breakfast. Staff at the venue were extremely polite, but afterward the groom was pulled aside and cordially invited to never come back, as was the MOB. Only problematic because the groom would really, really like to work there someday.

(I did my cardio appointment, and had a pleasant lunch in ""war-ravaged"" Portland with a friend, )

Overall, it sounds like everything went as smoothly as could be expected. While I absolutely love weddings, I'm glad I sat this one out.

We never received an invitation. MOB and Grandma of the bride are offended I wasn't there, but I think that's a ""them"" problem, not a ""me"" problem.

Thank you all for your lively, scathing, and witty responses to my original post.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This story feels so Oregon! It’s like I can imagine a lot of people I know doing shit like this, I mean I kind of did a last minute wedding too but I didn’t invite anyone 😂

Glad you had a good time!

> **OOP:** So Oregon

**Commenter 2:** Oh, I bet that BLT was delicious. The rest of the story is, too.

Now I'm trying to imagine what Thanksgiving will be like with this crowd...
> 
> **Commenter 3:** And this is where I would schedule a much needed appointment with endoscopy or the dentist or orthopedics....anything to be able to stay home🤣.
>> 
>> **OOP:** Even better, we are having our hardwood floors refinished and have to move out, furniture, pets, humans, everything, for 2 weeks. Gosh, I won't be able to host Thanksgiving or Christmas! Bummer.

**OOP on her own wedding theme**

> **OOP:** For my wedding (9 years ago) I wanted people to dress from any time period in history that they liked, but I gave 10 months advance notice, and also let guests know that costumes were ""admired but not required."" People had a blast, it was a wild and eclectic party, and I was surprised at some of the people who got into it. My dad--who was about 75 at the time--wore his old bagpiper's uniform, and my husband sported a white zoom suit.

We’re both single, we want similar things in life, of course things got flirtatious - and eventually escalated to sexual. We have made plans to meet up a few times, but it hasn’t worked out for various reasons (one time he got sick, one time I had a family emergency come up), so up until now it has all been digital. Overall, things have been good and I really like this guy! My only complaint overall has been that he tends to be “a man of few words” and often sends snap chats with only a pic rather than actually talking, but I’m a yapper so I talk enough for the both of us, and he doesn’t mind. 


Now for the incident. It’s actually been a few things over the last week or two. 


First, we were being flirty, a little spicy, and he threw in a comment along the lines of “you’re the h*rny tw*t who wants my c*m, you tell me what you want.” I’m not gonna lie, I popped off. I straight up told him not to talk to me like that. I’m all for dirty talk, but that was too far, especially since we have both been very clear that we are not just looking for a hook up. I do not like being called names, I do not like degradation. He did apologize, and I also apologized for the way I reacted, and we moved on. 


Next, a few days ago, I sent him a snap in the morning basically saying “It’s going to be a long day, I forgot to take my meds.” This has happened Before since we have been talking, I’ve told him that when I forget my meds, I’m a little loopy and sometimes more anxious or emotional. This day ended up being extra rough, and we talked throughout, so when I took my meds that night, to try and be light hearted, I sent him a snap saying “in case I wake up and can’t remember, I did in fact take my meds!” He came back with basically saying that there’s probably an app or something out there to track your antipsychotics like a period tracker, in a really dismissive and kind of pissy tone. I don’t take antipsychotics, I take a low dose of antidepressants, which I corrected him on, and he said it’s the “same sh*t”. Which both hurt and pissed me off. I still tried to lighten the mood and said I’m “fun crazy, not slash your tires crazy”. Which he didn’t respond to. 


Then earlier today he sent me a Facebook video of a guy opening a bedroom door and shaking a bottle of pills and an iced coffee saying something like “come on b*itch, I got your meds and your caffeine. Get out of bed.” Which… was funny. If this was a relationship where I knew we understood each others needs, it would be funny. But I’m still kinda stinging from the antipsychotic comment so I’m not sure how to take it. 


Honestly I’m at the point where these comments are starting to stack up, even though they’re one offs. Plus he’s just not really putting in the same effort as me to try and reschedule a time for us to get together, but I find a lot of guys are like that. I really like this guy and want to give it a shot, but I’m starting to feel like I’m just “entertainment” to him rather than someone he really wants to pursue, but I also feel like maybe my feelings are just hurt and I’m being too critical.

1osahta,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianWorkplace/comments/1osahta/accidently_sent_an_email_to_global_head_instead/,Accidently sent an email to global head instead of a fellow colleague,"TLDR; sent an email to Sushma (Global head) instead of Sushma (colleague), and embarrassed myself. Fuck Outlook autofill - AutoComplete.  
  
(For avoiding doubt, Sushma is not the real name. I will use Sushma ABC to indicate global head & Sushma XYZ to indicate my colleague)  
  
So I had some work for Sushma ABC, where I was preparing my team's pitch to send her. We had been interacting on emails and are on good terms. Sushma ABC is a global head and the senior most person I had met and interacted with in-person in my role. She basically reports to the board - so a lot of people want to be in her good books. She's firm, yet very humble and is very helpful. 

Sushma XYZ is a colleague who sends me her team's data for working on. She is 1-2 roles senior and a good friend as well. We've interacted in many office gatherings and she helps me with advice too. 

So while I was sending Sushma ABC the presentations for her review, I had to also request some data from Sushma XYZ. Now I had almost spent the entire 3/4 of my data making that presentation so 'Sushma ABC' was naturally going in my head. 

Now that the presentation was sent to Sushma ABC, I had to send an email to Sushma XYZ for the data. Had kept her seniors in the loop too, since they validate any gaps in the data that Sushma XYZ sends. 

I don't know what happened to me, but as I was putting 'To: Sushma & her seniors' I accidently wrote ""Sushma A"" instead of ""Sushma X"" and Control + K to autofill it. Once the email went, I went for my coffee break and came back after 15-20 mins.   
  
Sushma XYZ & her seniors are quick responders, they reply within 5-10 mins max, so I was expecting the data to be on my desk when I was back.   
  
Instead, I had a Teams message from Sushma XYZ which said ""😂🤣(my senior) asks you to check which Sushma you sent the mail to""

I was puzzled, and I stupidly replied ""...? You?""

""😂 check again""

And then I did. I was so fucking embarrassed. I was basically asking a global head to send measly data which is probably 1 line item which they are going skip anyways.  
  
I immediately recalled the email, and the recall report said ""Successfully recalled but seen by Sushma ABC"". I resent and got my data within 5 mins, so all cool.

I told my manager, and laughed like anything. ""If autocorrect can't help you, nothing can"". I told him that Sushma ABC probably thinks I'm an idiot and he said ""It's an honest mistake, so I'm sure that she would brush it off.""

Later, during a ""All seniors' meeting which my manager was a part of, he said that Sushma ABC praised me for the presentation to everyone, when she was talking to my manager and subsequent seniors. So my work did eventually shadow my stupid mistake.

For the past few days, I haven’t been able to sleep at all, and I have no idea why. Normally, I’d go to bed by 1 a.m. at the latest and wake up around 8. I’d get everything I needed done before the day ended. But lately, for no reason, I just can’t fall asleep. No matter what time I throw myself into bed (usually around 1 a.m.), I lie there wide awake. Thoughts keep running through my mind, and even though I try to stop thinking and just fall asleep, I simply can’t.

After about 30 minutes of tossing and turning, I get up—thinking maybe I’ll read a bit or do some drawing to get sleepy—but it’s useless.

Never dated. Maybe a few but it doesn’t really count. More like meetings. 

Perfectly at peace and happy with my own situation. I think the only thing that worries me, is when I’m old into my 90s, I want someone to eat my meals with. - so typical. I don’t want to eat alone. Seems like a sad thought. Though I don’t mind eating alone. I love having a cup of coffee and reading all day. I can probably do this for years and decades and feel happy. 

It’s just everyone in my life treats me like I am failing at life for choosing to be single. Even though I feel fine, and happy with myself. 

It kinda gets to me when I am feeling ok. But, everyone I care about and love looks at me like I’m not happy. 

It’s kind of to the point where they take it to their heart that THEY failed me. When it’s nothing of the sort. 

I did express, I don’t like the idea of intimacy. I’m not gay, I’m a straight female. I am attracted to males but with no interest in intimacy. 

I think it’s cruel to expect a non asexual person to date a person like me bc of my lack of sexual interest. So I don’t really try to find anyone. 


My family are really traditional and don’t understand. 

I’m just venting. I don’t know what to do except just stay silent and listen to them talk down to me when the topic of marriage comes up. They even bring up children at every chance. 

At points like that, I literally feel like I can’t breathe. But I just stay silent until everything passes bc that’s the only thing I know to do. 

I love all my family and friends, so I won’t cut them out of my life. I won’t stop talking to them. Honestly, I don’t ever expect them to understand a person like me. 

I will probably end up deleting this post sometime in the future haha bc I’m so wary someone in my life might chance upon this post. Anyway, you are all loved! Don’t give up! Find the happiness in life and focus on that. At least that’s what I try to tell myself.

Here is a recent article from Joonang Ilbo on the topic. I initially used machine translation and then edited some parts I found awkward for clarity.

[Link](https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25380508)

>**They just want to live youthfully… So why the backlash against the 'Young Forty' crowd?**

>8:30 a.m. on the 3rd, at a café in Mapo-gu, Seoul. Dressed in a black sweatshirt, gray jogger pants, and New Balance sneakers, 42-year-old office worker Kim Hyun-soo opened his laptop. Next to his coffee cup sat a Stanley tumbler, currently a hot item. “Today’s my weekly work-from-home day, and I just wanted to dress neatly,” he said. “But apparently, dressing like this these days makes you look like an ‘older guy trying to act young.’”

>After finishing work and heading home, Kim said he planned to pour himself a glass of wine delivered through a subscription service. “When people in their 20s do it, it’s called emotional consumption. But when someone in their 40s does it, they say it’s emotional indulgence,” he said. “I’m just trying to keep up with trends because I don’t want to be seen as a boomer…” Kim couldn’t hide a bitter smile.

>The term *Young Forty* (영포티), originally coined in the retail industry, referred to people in their 40s who enthusiastically embraced youthful sensibilities and culture. But online, it has gradually taken on a mocking tone. A major turning point came in the early 2020s with the viral spread of the phrase *Sweet Young Forty* on social media. On the surface, it seemed to describe a stylish man in his 40s, but in reality, it was a satirical jab at middle-aged men who act sweet only toward women in their 20s, while being strict with young male employees and overly friendly with young female ones. The term called out this behavior as a form of inappropriate flirtation disguised as kindness.

>Lee Ji-eun (28), an office worker from Songpa-gu, Seoul, remarked, “The real issue with some bosses in their 40s isn’t that they’re trying to act young. It’s that they pretend to be rational. In meetings, they’re strict with male employees in their 20s, but approach female employees with a friendly smile and buy them coffee.” She added, “They present themselves as open-minded, but once you start talking, you realize they’re just typical members of the older generation. Even when it comes to marriage or parenting, they only pretend to empathize.”

>Park Min-soo (31), another office worker, shared a similar view. “They act like they’re open to political issues, but in reality, they already have fixed answers,” he said. “Even when you bring up how young people have lost their footing in areas like real estate, they just nod and immediately shift back to their own point of view. That’s the mindset of today’s forty-somethings.”

>Professor Koo Jung-woo of Sungkyunkwan University's Department of Sociology emphasized the need to interpret the *Young Forty* controversy on two levels. “There’s a layer that can be understood apart from politics, and another that becomes more complicated when politics enters the picture,” he explained.

>On the non-political level, Professor Koo interpreted the backlash as a reflection of frustration and satire directed at middle-aged men in the workplace who pretend to understand younger generations but fail to genuinely empathize in conversation, making their behavior seem hypocritical. On the political level, he pointed to how online polarization ties generational, gender, and regional conflicts to ideological divides. “This tendency to reduce cultural and organizational issues to political frames makes it even harder to resolve them,” he noted.

>Back to lunchtime on the 4th. Returning to the office after a long time, Mr. Kim headed to a trendy salad café with younger colleagues. As he sipped his coffee, he cautiously dropped a phrase popular among younger people “Gotta live 갓생 these days” but the awkward smiles and sidelong glances from his juniors made it clear the reaction wasn’t great. “If I use phrases young people like, they mock me for being cringey. But if I speak the way my generation does, they call me a boomer,” Kim said, shaking his head. “It feels like I’m taking a multiple-choice test where every answer is wrong.”

>On this issue, Professor Kwak Geum-joo of Seoul National University's Department of Psychology identified a lack of *metacognition* (self-awareness) as the core problem. “As people age or rise in rank, their thinking tends to become more rigid, yet many still believe they’re free of bias. This creates a cognitive illusion,” she explained. “The greater the gap between one’s ideal self, stylish and open-minded, and one’s real self, the more anxiety and depression can arise. That’s the space where public satire finds its way in.” She advised, “In every situation, it’s important to view yourself from a third-person perspective. Rather than blindly trying to emulate people in their 20s, it’s better to seek role models in their 50s or 60s and cultivate a mature sensibility grounded in listening and consideration.”

>Political forums are also rife with criticism, with posts calling *Young Forty* “the last gasp of progressive boomers” or accusing them of “talking reform while being conservative on gender and climate issues.” Na Jung-yeon, a woman in her 20s, commented, “I don’t think all people in their 40s are like that, but it’s easy to find ones who shout progressive slogans while being more conservative than anyone else in practice. Honestly, if they just admitted, ‘Yeah, I’m a boomer,’ it’d be less frustrating.”

>In the consumer market, people in their 40s remain the most powerful demographic. They still lead spending in fashion and food & beverage. Yet criticism often follows, branding them as “pretentious and clueless about value for money.” Cultural critic Jung Deok-hyun responded, “Most people in their 40s aren’t trying to act young. They’re simply trying to adapt to the times. We’ve moved from a generation-based society to one organized around taste. So if we box *Young Forty* into a generational frame, we risk distorting the reality.”

>Professor Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University’s Department of Psychology diagnosed the root of the tension as a deep sense of deprivation felt by younger generations, stemming from rising housing prices and pension reform. “There’s also a growing perception among young people that the 40s and 50s who already hold economic and political power are now trying to claim cultural space as well. That sense of encroachment is fueling resentment,” he explained.

>As a result, people in their 20s push back, saying, “The 40s are already part of the establishment, and now they’re invading youth culture too.” Meanwhile, those in their 40s reject the younger generation’s demand to “act their age,” and the *Young Forty* controversy continues to grow and reproduce itself over time.

>Professor Lim added, “The 40s and 50s generation carries both pride in their role in democratization and traces of having grown up in authoritarian environments. This often leads to a mismatch between their outward image and inner mindset.” He advised, “Those in their 20s and 30s should acknowledge the foundations laid by older generations and refrain from excessive ridicule, while the 40s and 50s should tone down the self-display and respond to the younger generation’s struggles like housing and employment with empathy and care.”

>It’s also worth noting that many *Young Forty* individuals see themselves as a “bridge generation.” Kim Jin-woo, a man in his 40s, said, “I understand the language of older generations and have a decent grasp of MZ culture. At work, I try to play the role of a middleman in communication.” But when someone in their 40s dominates a meeting with lengthy remarks while insisting they’re “open-minded,” it often shuts down genuine dialogue. Professor Koo also emphasized, “What younger generations want in a mature adult isn’t flashy language. It’s consistent consideration and tangible support.”

>As the *Young Forty* debate shows, people in their 40s today are caught in a “double bind” across politics, economics, society, and culture. If they try to relate to younger sensibilities, they’re labeled *young boomer* (영꼰); if they don’t, they’re simply called *boomer*. If they lean progressive, they’re accused of hypocrisy; if conservative, they’re dismissed as outdated. In this climate, ordinary people like Kim Hyun-soo spend each day in constant self-censorship. “Is it really so wrong to try to live in step with the times?” he asked. “In a society where survival is already a fierce competition, do people in their 20s and 40s really need to be at odds like this? I wish we could move past the mockery. It’d be nice if we could all be just a little more generous with each other.”

>Experts agree that generational conflict is nothing new, but they warn that the current tensions have reached a level that can no longer be ignored. They stress the urgency of finding solutions at a societal level. Above all, they caution against the mistake of generalizing entire generations.

>Cultural critic Jung noted, “Generational categories have long been shaped more by political and marketing convenience than by lived reality. Today, people are grouped more by personal identity through taste and values than by age. So instead of focusing on generational education, we need to expand opportunities for exchange based on shared interests.” He added that consuming and sharing content and experiences together is far more effective than perfunctory conversations like “How’s it going these days?”

>Professor Kwak emphasized the importance of inclusive leadership from those in their 40s, who have the experience of having once been young. “Rather than trying to ‘win’ against people in their 20s, it’s more important for those in their 40s to lead with humility and openness,” she said. “It helps to regularly ask yourself: ‘Did I interrupt someone?’ ‘Am I dominating the conversation?’ That kind of self-checking can go a long way in easing the *Young Forty* tensions.”",5,1762663668.0,korea,3,0.78,False

I've been sleeping for at least 7-8 hrs, but in the last week, I only managed to sleep for 5-6 hours a night.
Probably this might be a factor that contributed to my problem.

I’ve been awake since 4am with a maximum of 3 hours of sleep.

Does anyone else have this problem as well and is managing it with daily beta-blockers to prevent tachycardia? 
I feel like every post I’ve seen on here is referring to tachycardia as “100 to 120” and mine was well over that.

I am here to share my report of my very first year as a Magic Key holder from Nov. 2nd 2024 to just last week. 

A little background about me: I'm a mid-30s millenial woman and I grew up in SoCal going to Disneyland with my family. I just love the nostalgia for those happy memories. I also enjoy the 90m drive or train ride to Anaheim because it gets me in adventure mode (and my eyes off a screen!) This year, I treated Disneyland as my ""country club"" and went alone a bunch. Here are the highlights:

**Tier Purchased** Believe for $1374, or $81.67 in monthly payments after applying a 2-day ticket down payment

**# Times I Thought I Would Go to the Parks** 10-12

**Actual # of Times I Went to the Parks** 22

**I can explain!** Sometimes I was in the area for work already staying in a nearby hotel and would go in the evenings! Also, I found my sweet spot to be approximately a half day on Sundays from just after rope drop until 3pm. Honestly perfect for a half Disneyland/half football household.

**Dates Visited** Nov 2, Nov 7, Nov 17, Nov 20, Nov 25, Nov 27, Dec 11, Dec 16, Feb 8, Feb 24, March 2, March 15, April 8, May 18, June 11, June 22, July 20, Aug 10, Aug 17, Aug 18, Sept 14, Sept 27.

**Cost Per Visit:** $62.45

**Best Day** [June 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1li7001/half_day_full_tummy/) probably. So dreamy. It's great to enjoy your own company. Also Nov. 27 was the night before Thanksgiving. I drove up after work and it was surprisingly quiet and lovely.

**Worst Day** March 15... it was extremely crowded and I made the mistake of conceding to a friend not being a morning person so we didn't arrive until noon. I should have made him suck it up and get there early like duh. We had a tough time getting on rides; we were super overstimulated; tdid oo much zig zagging. NEVER AGAIN.

**Most Purchased Snack(s)** Ronto wraps + churros + plain caramel apples + spare ribs kids meal from Hungry Bear + Boysen apple freeze from Maurice's Treats

**Worst Snack** the spicy fireside mac and cheese bites from Troubador Tavern. I also threw away the green milk after one sip. 

**Favorite Park Staple Treat** Boysen Apple Freeze done up with the works and honestly, the classic caramel apple just cannot be beat. They are always crunchy and perfect.

**Favorite Temporary/Seasonal(? idk - it was new in Sept) Treat** The Waffle Cristo sandwich at Royal Street Veranda (discontinued - boooooo it was the perfect breakfast) and the Black Caf cookies and cream slushy from Kat Saka's Kettle. Good lord this thing is special. Wish I had one right now.

**Total Steps** 395,358 you see, it's also a gym membership

**Ride Breakdowns/B Modes** Fewer than 5 I can remember. No evacuations. The only major one was Indiana Jones. I saw them remove a vehicle from the track and put it backstage (so cool!) + got to ride again.

**Rides I Never Rode** Teacups, Small World, Astro Orbiter, Autopia, Explorer Canoes, Golden Zephyr, Grizzly River, Jumpin Jellyfish, King Arthur Carousel, Ariel's Underwater Nap Time, Luigi's, Mater's, Mickey's Death Wheel, Sailing Ship Columbia, Silly Symphony Swings

**Do I Regret This?** No

**Lightning Lanes?** Only when going with friends and only when I or another experienced Disneylander are in control

**Locker?** Not as a single rider, unless your coat is too big to carry all day and/or you want to safely store souvenirs.

**Most Magical Moments** Finding Crustacea in the final scene of MMRR, the Shboom moment in Cars Land, watching first timers' jaws drop on Rise, friendly strangers waving to each other from the train, Elsa genuinely complimenting a little girl's dress from her Paint the Night float, that first hit of churro

**Recipe for a Perfect Single Rider Day** Arrive at/just after rope drop (get your coffee on the way!) Place mobile orders for lunch + Harbor Galley cookies for pickup later. Walk onto Big Thunder, Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, and Space Mountain single rider. Walk onto Buzz and Star Tours because you're right there. Mobile order a mint julep for an hour from now. Browse Star Traders. Mobile order a Ronto Morning wrap and haul ass to Galaxy's Edge to get it before the breakfast cutoff. Scarf it down while people watching on a bench between Galaxy's Edge and Frontierland. Waddle to Pirate's to digest. Wander the New Orleans Square shops on the way to pick up your mint julep. Get on the train from NOS to Toontown for MMRR. Ride MMRR. Hit Matty Bobs single rider, but if it's down, go back to Big Thunder. Grab a churro and a boysen apple freeze, and take a breather in the Nemo Observation room or the Fantasyland Theater show. Go pick up your high protein lunch that you mobile ordered earlier, then get in the single rider line for Tiana's. Then, do standby for Rise and single rider for Smuggler's. Pick up your HG cookies and enjoy them in line for Jungle Cruise. Marvel at your efficiency and go shopping or do literally anything else you want at whatever pace you want. You are carbed TF out and you have hit all the flagship rides; you are unstoppable (but seriously do not stop moving at this point or your legs will give out bigtime! Move it or lose it!)

**Best Thing You Can Do to Save Your Sanity if the Parking Garage is Super Backed Up or Full** Park at GardenWalk and walk over to the Harbor entrance. It's less than $20 for the whole day and closer than the Toy Story lot. You're welcome! 

**Was the Pass Worth It?** Yes! I enjoyed treating myself to Disneyland ""whenever I wanted"" and feel I got my money's worth. I visited enough times to justify the higher tier pass for parking, but some of these visits were via train or had free hotel parking nearby, so it's still a wash for me personally. 

**Did I Renew?** I did not. I am both satisfied with the experience I had over the past year, and I believe in voting with my dollars. It's also no surprise to anyone that prices are increasing but perks are not. The next time I go to the parks will likely be with SoCal resident discount tickets, but not for a while. For now, I have had my fill, and my inner child is very happy. I have enjoyed sharing this space with yall :)

I loved how they are transparent about using China Matcha. The guy there said they wanted it to be sustainable. So off the bat, I wasn’t a fan of sipping as it is to get all the layers, which they suggested. They used clarified matcha as base, with cold brew, syrup, and coffee foam. It was bordering on bland and I imagined this is how dishwater tastes like. But when I stirred it, it has this creamy mouthfeel and the flavors just came together. Although It’s not something I would order again. Don’t get me wrong, I loved their coffee concoctions in that branch but their take on dirty matcha is just not for me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=IESnvL564VQ&list=WL&index=10&t=1s

-Read the whole recipe before messaging me and ask me concrete questions.

-I use dihydrocodeine 30mg and 50 mg promethazine pills (or diphenhydramine)

-Cold water extract 2000mg of dihydrocodeine (or codeine) and 1000mg promethazine (or diphenhydramine) with 160 ml warm water (all at once). You will lose roughly 20% doing so (i will not consider the loss to make it more simple)

-Mix with 770 ml of either torani, monin, humco, crown, karo or homemade simple syrup ( l used 500ml of strawberry torani syrup and 270ml crown corn syrup for thickness)

-Add 7% of global 94, (or equivalent brand) which is 70 ml. If you don't have access to it, use vodka.

-Mix your cold water extraction with the syrup and alcohol.

-Opioid equivalent dose approximately : Codeine
200mg = Morphine 30mg = Hydromorphone 6mg
Oxycodone 20mg

Few other tips based on recurrent questions i get:
-Codeine or dihydrocodeine 60mg per ounce
-Morphine 15mg per ounce
-Hydrocodone 10mg per ounce
-Oxycodone 7mg per ounce
-Hydromorphone 2mg per ounce

-For extended release pills you can try crushing them, dissolving them in alcohol and then extract with coffee filters to get rid of fillers. You can leave it in alcohol for a few days to make sure you get the most out of it. Obviously the best way to go is instant release pills. Blending the pills in alcohol also works really great if it does not dissolve on it's own.

-If you want to make your own simple syrup there are more steps to it that i won't include here. The reasons why i use brand name syrups are because i don't have to worry about the preservatives and they work just fine to me as i am not trying to replicate anything.

-I do not sell anything ! This is a hobby and i'm just trying to teach people on how to do this in the simplest way possible.

-It is to your discretion to change colour, strength, consistency, opioid and quantity of antihistamine used etc.

-Antihistamine worth using also is chlorpheniramine.

-Antihistamines (prevents nausea and itchiness) and alcohol are not a necessity but i suggest you use v them.

-Antihistamines (prevents nausea and itchiness) and alcohol are not a necessity but i suggest you use them.

-If you want a ligh purple, use a clear canne sugar syrup (monin, torani or sugar water homemade). As there has no colour added, use a light blue food dye mixed with pink food dye. Play with colours until you have it right there is no secret to the right colouring.

-Yes you need to cwe pills that don't even contain paracetamol (acetaminophen). If you dont cwe, your syrup will be horribly cloudy because of the fillers.

-The amount of water you use for your cold water extract is up to you. It's going to affect the consistency of the syrup. Also note that the less water you use the more codeine you lose so take all that into consideration.

-This is for fun so have fun with it. You fail one batch, do another one until you get it right. That's how i learned: trial and error and i probably saved you a lot of time and money with this recipe!

-Let's make home-brew syrup a safe way to sip lean by understanding how it's made, CHEERS!

For most of us, the microwave oven is a kitchen workhorse for one thing: rescuing leftovers from the cold, dark depths of the fridge. It's the popcorn popper, the coffee re-heater, the quick defroster for last-minute meal planning.

But what if I told you that you're using about 10% of your microwave oven's actual potential? Tucked away on your countertop, you have a powerful tool that can steam vegetables to crisp-tender perfection, poach eggs for a quick breakfast, and even cook entire meals with surprisingly good results.

It's time to stop thinking of it as a re-heating box and start seeing it for what it is: a legitimate cooking appliance. Ready to level up?

## It's All About the Technique, Not Just the Wattage

Before we get to the recipes, let's talk fundamentals. The difference between a sad, rubbery mess and a perfectly microwaved dish comes down to a few simple techniques.

1.  **Embrace the Power Level.** That button isn't just for show. Cooking everything on 100% power is like searing everything on your stove on high. You'll get a burnt outside and a raw inside. For tasks like softening butter or cream cheese, melting chocolate, or gently reheating a delicate sauce, try using 30-50% power. It takes longer, but the results are infinitely better.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=microwave%20oven)

2.  **Arrange, Don't Dump.** Microwaves zap food from the outside in. To get even cooking, you need to help the energy out. Arrange food in a single layer. For plates of leftovers, form a ""Z"" or ring shape, leaving the center empty. The center heats up fastest, so leaving it empty prevents overcooked edges.

3.  **Master the Damp Paper Towel.** This is the oldest trick in the book for a reason. Placing a damp paper towel over foods like bread, tortillas, or reheated rice prevents them from drying out and creates a mini-steam bath.

4.  **Let It Rest.** This is the most important—and most ignored—rule. Your microwave oven doesn't ""stop"" cooking the instant the timer dings. The molecules continue to vibrate and distribute heat for several minutes. Letting food rest for 1-3 minutes after microwaving allows the heat to equalize, leading to much more even results.

## What You're *Really* Missing: Cooking, Not Just Reheating

Once you have the techniques down, you can start actually cooking. Here are a few game-changers.

### Perfectly Steamed Veggies in Minutes

Forget boiling away all the nutrients. The microwave creates a perfect steam environment for vegetables.

> **How to do it:** Chop your veggies (broccoli florets, sliced carrots, green beans are all great). Place them in a microwave-safe bowl with about two tablespoons of water. Cover the bowl with a microwave-safe plate or lid (don't seal it completely—leave a small vent). Microwave on high for 2-4 minutes, depending on the vegetable and your desired crispness. Let it rest for a minute before carefully removing the lid to avoid a steam facial.

### One-Bowl Eggs and Scrambles

Yes, you can make delicious eggs in the microwave in under two minutes. It’s a lifesaver on busy mornings.

> **How to do it:** Crack one or two eggs into a greased, microwave-safe mug or bowl. Add a splash of milk or water and whisk with a fork until smooth. For scrambled eggs, microwave on 50% power for 60-90 seconds, stopping halfway to stir. For a ""poached"" or baked egg, just cook it on full power for about 60 seconds, or until the white is set but the yolk is still runny.

## The One Tool I Wish I’d Bought Years Ago

For the longest time, I was just covering my bowls with random plates or plastic wrap. It worked, but it was a hassle, and I always ended up with a mess.

Then I discovered a simple, glass, lidded microwave steamer dish. It's not a fancy, brand-name gadget—just a heavy-duty, borosilicate glass bowl with a vented lid.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=microwave%20oven)

This one thing completely changed how I use my microwave oven. It turns it into a dedicated vegetable steamer, a perfect re-heater for leftovers (no more splatters!), and a vessel for cooking grains and one-pot meals. The glass heats evenly, the lid traps steam perfectly, and it’s easy to clean. It's the kind of upgrade that doesn't feel like buying a new appliance, but rather like finally getting the right tool for the job.

## Final Thoughts

Your microwave oven is so much more than a convenience for zombie-like late-night reheating. It's a fast, efficient, and energy-saving way to cook real food. By understanding a few basic techniques and maybe adding the right tool to your arsenal, you can transform it from a box of mediocrity into one of the most useful allies in your kitchen.

1osa70k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1osa70k/how_toxic_was_this/,How toxic was this?,"He and I broke up recently, and the more I think about our relationship, the more I realize that I was getting the short end of the stick. It's a long read but I promise it'll give you an idea of the person I was with. 

- he constantly complained about being broke, but did not budget well. Even now, I have savings and he doesn't. 

- he said that women tend to use men as wallets, and blamed me for him not having savings due to how much money he ""had"" to spend on me. I never asked for any lavish dates and I gave him multiple examples of low budget dates - he never did any of them. I don't know why he did this if he couldn't afford it.

- he could not afford to buy a washer/dryer with me, so for months we went without. I offered to buy them, and he refused because he didn't want to be indebted to me. He insisted on doing laundry at the laundromat himself since he was the reason we didn't have a WD. Months later, he complained about my spending habits and said that they were the reason why we didn't have a WD. I corrected him immediately on this because wth.

- he came across a nice chunk of change - about $14,000. He blew through all of it in a year, while being employed the entire time. I did not find out about this until a year after it happened. 

- he claimed he liked to cook, but also wanted to make the most low effort meals possible. He did not contribute any recipes to the household, besides his 4 favorite comfort meals... Which were all spicy and greasy and had ingredients that I did not like. I searched up low effort recipes and he barely made any of them. Much food went to waste, including potatoes, which he didn't like to work with. 

- he claimed that I was picky and that my need for a variety of food was out of boredom. I grew up eating a large variety of foods and wouldn't consider myself particularly picky. Despite his beliefs, he is incredibly picky. Introducing new foods was risky because it was a 50/50 chance if he'd like it. He disliked a lot of perfectly normal dishes for reasons I didn't always understand. Half his diet was probably fast food, as I kept finding fast food bags/boxes in the trash or freezer. 

- after several issues with ED, he got diagnosed with low T. His options were to take testosterone for the rest of his life, or make lifestyle changes. He did neither, and complained about his ED and our sex life suffering. I tried to encourage him to make lifestyle changes multiple times, but he never tried. I had to learn to deal with getting a lot less intimacy than I would have liked. 

- he claimed to be fairly progressive and moderate. Later on, I found out he voted for trump. As our relationship progressed, he became more right-wing and extreme. Political discussions became uncivil extremely quickly because he would start tearing me down if I didn't fully agree with his viewpoints. Ironically, my views usually landed somewhere in the middle and I usually agreed with him on some level. But nonetheless, if I didn't fully agree with him it was because I was stupid or didnt have good core values.

- an incident at his job landed him in hot water. We both discussed it and agreed that the writing was on the wall and that he'd eventually be let go. He forgot this conversation entirely. When he got axed months later, he was ""blindsided"" and had no other job lined up. 

- he misunderstood basic aspects of relationships. I had to explain the concept of compromises to him on several occasions because he believed it was ""forcing the other person to change themselves"". It took several months and multiple discussions for him to finally understand it in a way that wasn't a threat or attempt to suppress him. I tried explaining the concept of relationship boundaries and dealbreakers to him, and he claimed they were ""threats"". Anytime I tried to bring up my relationship needs and boundaries, I was ""threatening"" him.

- he told somewhat mean spirited jokes and I asked him to stop because they hurt my feelings. He said I was over sensitive, but promised to stop anyway. He didn't. Every time I didn't find them funny, he called me over sensitive. 

- I flinch at loud noises and get scared when someone looms over me due to some bad life experiences. In some arguments he'd lose his temper and scream at me. Sometimes when I flinched, he'd say ""Oh don't flinch like I'm about to hit you! Jesus!"" 

- we planned on moving into a house together. He wanted to move in his jobless deadbeat friend who didn't have a license. He said his friend would ""lock in"" and find a job. This friend was aloof and barely spoke to me when he was over. 

- he had a habit of invalidating my feelings if they were negative or he didn't agree with them. He got irritated when I grieved for ""too long"" for a deceased pet. If I was having a bad mental health day, he'd often ask me if I was *actually* having a bad mental health day, or if I just got into my head and made it so. If I didn't forgive him immediately after an argument, he said I was ""purposefully staying mad just to stay mad"". If I said I was unhappy with a certain aspect of our relationship, he told me to be happy with less, like he did. 

- he wanted to be a writer and sometimes showed me his writing for feedback. The concept was unoriginal, the main character was clearly a self-insert, and his writing style was full of itself yet packed with run-on sentences. I had to dial back my critiques because they made him defensive. I pretended to like and support his writing to keep the peace.

- he made a snide comment about how much stuff I had while we planned our move into the house. When we moved in together, I was the only reason why we had pots and pans, dishes, silverware, a sofa, a TV, nightstands, a shoe cubby, and a first aid kit. 

- he claimed he wanted to be a ""provider"". He threw a tantrum when I bought a coffee table and asked him to assemble it. He also threw a tantrum when I pointed out that I was the only one restocking paper towels, dish soap, toilet paper, and hand soap in our home. 

- he had a coke and adderal problem in college. He had since been clean for years. However, when he spoke of those years he was clearly very nostalgic for those times and reminisced quite a bit. He also made jokes about coke constantly. Somehow it got brought up in a lot of conversations. His favorite mug also had a coke joke printed on it. When I mentioned that a friend of mine had leftover Adderall, he lit up and asked me if he could buy it off of her. I was worried that someday he'd fall back into it, because he clearly still loved uppers.

- he got hospitalized 4 times from Crohn's in 8 years. The last time it happened, I stayed in the hospital with him for a week and waited on him hand and foot while advocating for his care with his doctors and nurses. When he was released, I suggested eating healthier. He accused me of being glad he got hospitalized so that I could say ""I told you so"" (this was my first time bringing it up btw) and said that he never needed me there with him in the hospital. 

- I love cats, and would like to get one someday. In the summer, I fostered a kitten that was at deaths door but made a miraculous recovery. Once recovered, the kitten was quite needy and yelled for attention a lot. One day she was yelling for attention and he snapped and screamed at her. I told him that this was unacceptable behavior and that I did not want him acting like that towards any of our pets. He gave me a lecture on how animals don't think and feel in the same way that humans do, and that the kitten would forget about it pretty much immediately. Yikes.

What do you call a person like this, and why do they act like this? I'm genuinely so confused as to how such an affectionate and sweet fella could be such a poor partner. ",1,1762663113.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

if the midst of this, i happened to hit it off with a stranger at a garage sale and we exchanged numbers.  the stranger happened to be planning to open a new coffee shop in a nearby town in a few months and asked about if like my current job.  i felt like i should be loyal, so told her i was happy there.  but then my hours at my current shop kept steadily trickling down to about 18/week.  there was a rough manager meeting at my current shop, where the owners had a lot of criticism to give and no positive feedback.  they were upset i had called a customer creepy to them. they also said at the meeting that they wanted us to be ministering to customers more, which made me question if the job is a good fit, since I am not Christian and they are both pastors.  the word “minister” rubbed me the wrong way since i was not hired to be a missionary 

after that meeting, i reached out to express interest in the new shop.  the owner of the new shop was so excited, she said she thought we met for a reason, and she told me she’s looking to hire a few full time staff members.  she invited me to hop local coffee shops to try coffees and discuss her vision and plans for the new shop, see her new shop, and to get my input and also interview me.  she has not worked in coffee before, which i know should be a red flag.  but she’s so much friendlier than my current boss.  and her family has a good reputation in the town for being trustworthy and wealthy enough to give their staff steady hours.  and i am really excited about the idea of being part of a new shop and having my ideas valued   

this last week, we had another manager meeting, and my boss was acting like a different person.  just super nice to us, had a lot of good things to say, and was even pointedly interested in including me.  she promised me (only about 5) more hours in january.  then she hung out in the shop for my entire next shift and was socializing with us and helping with customers all day.  that is something my coworkers and i do for each other a lot since we are friends, but my boss has never done for me before

i’m confused on the behavior shift.  maybe my boss knows competition is opening and is scared of losing staff.  maybe she even knows from the rumor mill that i’m interviewing with them and she wants to keep me.  or maybe she’s genuinely starting to value me.  she said something in the meeting about thanking us for giving them a safe space within our community (her husband is an immigrant, and we are all super supportive of immigrants.  while our town is very conservative).  it made me feel guilty about the idea of leaving.  it will certainly look bad to my coworkers, who have even bad mouthed the new shop opening since they are upset we will have rivals in a nearby town.  my coworkers all seem to worship our bosses and i just had a different experience with them until this week 

another factor in this decision is that i am currently sharing a car with my partner since we work across the street from each other.  it’s very convenient and we even head home together for lunch.  i can even walk to work.  if i switch shops, i would need to buy a second vehicle.  the new shop is a 10 minute drive away.  but it would be nice to have consistent enough hours to be able to afford a second vehicle in the first place 

TLDR I have a job at a local quality coffee shop with inconsistent hours and inconsistent treatment from bosses.  A new coffee shop with a very kind but inexperienced boss is interested in hiring me, showing great potential for good pay and treatment.  i live in a small town where switching shops is bound to lead to drama and losing my work friends.  is it worth jumping shops?

1osa1fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1osa1fs/grind_consistency/,Grind consistency,"I have a question, genuine question about grind consistency. I've eagerly watched every video from Hoffman and Hedrick and many others and am on the perpetual quest to get better tasting coffee. I'm still using the Barista Express grinder and contemplating the DF54 or NZ. I understand that they do produce a grind with a narrower particle size distribution more consistently compared to the Breville.

But my question is, is that necessarily any better tasting? A wider range of particle sizes would probably introduce a more rounded profile. A bit like a violin vs an orchestra. You may really like the violin by itself, but the whole orchestra can sound pretty good too. As long as the distribution of particle sizes in from the Breville is consistent and they are well mixed, the packing efficiency should be the same and hence the same shot times for the same grind and shot weights. i.e. 'consistent' in that sense. I get that the steps in the Breville are chunky and so it is hard to get the exact dosing time. But Hedrick has also commented that 2:1 etc are not hard and fast rules and they 'depend' , as does the 30 sec thumbrule.

In his interview with Steve Bartlett, Hoffman said (paraphrasing), that the grinder is a more important part than the brewer/espresso machine. Granted that my palette is anything but refined, I'm trying to see if the improvement in taste & texture is noticeably better when using a good grinder, or is this more a geeky pursuit of perfection.

A somewhat related analogy is in whiskey where I am a collector and do have a fair degree of appreciation. In short, at the start the moonshine that goes into the casks has a mindblowing combination of flavors. But as aromatics are volatile, they evaporate over the years and the longer in the cask, the fewer are left. i.e. you start with an orchestra and in the end are left with the violin or oboe or some other single note. That isn't necessarily better than the orchestra, it is just different. Because price is an index to value for most people (expensive wine must taste better than cheap wine...), people can convince themselves that aged whiskey tastes better than younger batches. However, if you do the math, old whisky has to cost more just based on economics alone. i.e if you lose 3% a year to evaporation and 3% a year is inflation. Then keeping a 12 year to age 24 means you have (0.97)\^12 = 69% of the volume depreciated by 3%, meaning you have to charge 43% more just for depreciation. ie. you have to charge 2x just to make the same money on the volume you sell, and that's not counting  storage and labor costs and other losses like barrels breaking etc. Long story short, you pay at least 2x for a 24 yr old vs 12 yr old just so the the distillery can make exactly the same profit on both. The doubling of price isn't because it is mindblowingly better, it is because of simple economics. I had a long chat with the Chief Noser at a major distillery and he essentially agreed with the premise. One caveat being that the more aged bottlings aren't purely time based, but also carefully selected to be more enjoyable, but you get the idea.

I'm interested in hearing if you really experienced much better tasting coffee on a dedicated grinder, or did you talk yourself into believing that based on the investment you made, the marketing and social media posts.",2,1762662616.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Their three-flavored curry was both visually stunning and deeply satisfying. The dish featured a rich combination of flavors such as green curry on one side, a deeper tomato-based curry in the center, and a pork-based umami rich curry on the other, all surrounding a mound of multigrain rice. Each bite brought a gentle complexity, with the vegetables and seafood complementing the distinct curry bases perfectly. The side dishes added refreshing contrast with their crisp textures and subtle acidity, making the meal feel well-rounded and nourishing. The cardamom coffee, served with a siphon, carries a beautiful aroma, floral, citrusy, and slightly spicy, that paired wonderfully with the meal’s warmth. It’s brewed cleanly and served with elegance, offering both depth and clarity in flavor. For dessert, the pudding was classic yet refined: smooth, rich, and gently sweet, with a delicate caramel layer that adds just the right bitterness.

All I wanted was to drive straight into their venue and kill us all.
I was about to floor it when my phone wouldn't stop buzzing.
I picked up. It's the hospital.
""Miss Kingston, you're pregnant.""
I killed the engine. Froze.
Thirty minutes later, I started the car again. 
But this time, I turned around and drove straight to the airport.
Just like that, the fake heiress everyone wanted gone vanished from New York.
I fled to Austin, a thousand miles away. 
Almost died having my baby girl. But we made it.
And never talked to any of them again.
Not until four years later, when they all came crawling back.

Four years later, I ran into Cade Sullivan picking up kids from school.

I'd just gotten Maya when another mom came over.

""Oh my god, Maya's mom, look—that guy across the street. Isn't he that singer? God, what's his name again...""

I looked where she was pointing and stopped dead.

""Cade!"" She snapped her fingers. ""That's him!""

I looked away. ""Never heard of him.""

She stared at me. ""Wait, you don't listen to music? Cade! He's been huge the past few years—singer-songwriter, tons of awards!""

She leaned closer, squinting at me. ""Actually... you two kind of look alike. Both gorgeous...""

I smiled and shook my head, taking Maya's hand as we kept walking.

But then I heard his voice behind me.

""Sasha.""

I didn't stop.

""Sasha Kingston!""

Maya looked up. ""Mommy, is that man calling you? Why's he saying Sasha Kingston?""

I shook my head. ""Wrong person, sweetie.""

But when we got to the parking lot and I reached for the car door, someone grabbed my arm.

I turned around—

Cade, out of breath.

""Sasha, you... you're actually alive?""

Same old Cade. Still a total asshole.

Maybe he'd run too fast, because his eyes were red.

I dropped Maya off with the neighbor.

When I came back down, Cade was standing there with his hands in his pockets.

""Why are you living in this shithole? Where's your place? I'm coming up.""

I shook my head. ""Don't bother.""

Four years ago, he made it pretty clear—his only sister was Ivy Sullivan.

He also made it clear that calling me his sister made him sick.

When Garrett Kingston kicked me out, when Rhys Callahan dumped me, when I had nowhere to go, I thought about asking my actual brother for help.

I stood outside his office all night in a snowstorm. Nearly froze to death.

What did I get? Him telling me he wished I'd never been born.

""If you didn't exist, Ivy wouldn't have been switched at birth. She wouldn't have suffered.""

""Sister? That's hilarious. The Kingstons don't want you, so now you're trying to guilt-trip me?""

""I'd never call someone like you my sister.""

That's when I got it—didn't matter how good I was to him. He hated me because of Ivy.

Now he was staring at me with that same look.

""That kid... she's Rhys's, right? You ran off to have his baby?""

I didn't say anything for a second. ""She's my daughter. Mine.""

He smirked. ""Come on, Sasha, that kid's a carbon copy of him. You think I'm blind?""

""Wait, did you really think having his baby would make him come back to you? That's some delusional romantic nonsense...""

""It's pathetic. Absolutely pathetic...""

""I said she's my daughter. Mine."" I cut him off.

""I never planned on going back to New York. Never planned on using my kid to steal Rhys from your precious Ivy. So relax. And quit coming at me like this.""

""Like you said back then—we share blood, that's it. We're strangers. I don't care about your life, so don't try to run mine.""

He just stared at me.

""If that's all, leave.""

""Wait."" He grabbed my arm again.

Opened his mouth. Then closed.

""You... you...""

I frowned. ""What?""

""Why'd you even leave back then...""

I just looked at him.

""You were this spoiled rich girl who couldn't do anything. So people talked sh//it about you—big deal. Why'd you have to run off and do this whole single-mom thing?""

""If I hadn't found you, how long were you gonna keep living like this? And these past four years...""

He stopped.

""H-How'd you even survive?""

I looked at his eyes, red around the edges again.

Probably pissed.

He's probably shocked I'm still breathing. And me being alive? That's a threat to Ivy's perfect life.

How did I survive?

Someone died so I could.

But he doesn't need to know that.

The old Sasha was like some useless hothouse flower.

The new me? I stopped crying on people's shoulders a long time ago.

When I didn't answer, he got more worked up.

""What the HELL, why are you acting so weird now? Did that massive earthquake in Austin a few years back mess up your brain or something?""

""Running off to some middle-of-nowhere place like this—you had an earthquake coming.""

Just then, a neighbor walked by and waved. ""Hey, Wren, haven't started dinner yet?""

I smiled. ""About to.""

Cade froze.

""You should go,"" I said.

But he wouldn't let go of my arm.

""Wait, why'd you change your name? Wren? Did you get married? Whose name is that?""

""None of your business.""

I pulled free, saying it slow so he'd get it.

""What my name is, how I'm doing, Cade—none of your business.""

Cade's a celebrity.

No way he's making a scene in public.

I went upstairs, got Maya, and looked out the window. He was still down there, staring up.

He never cared about me before. His confusion now? Probably just thrown off because I'm not kissing his butt anymore.

Four years ago, after I found out he wanted to be a musician, I used up every connection I had just to get him one shot on stage.

His agency—I'm the one who got him signed.

He's my brother. He'd been through he//ll. I wanted him to do well.

But he twisted all of it, said I was manipulative, trying to make Ivy miserable.

""Mommy, was that man your family?""

I blinked, then smiled and touched her hair. ""No, baby. Why would you think that?""

""Just guessing. You look alike.""

Family?

Garrett's face flashed through my mind.

I used to think no matter what, blood or not, Garrett would always be my brother.

But four years ago, he held Ivy after she ""fell"" down the stairs and looked at me like I was garbage.

""Sasha, you've disappointed me for the last time.""

""Starting today, you're not part of the Kingston family. You're not my sister.""

""My only sister is Ivy.""

I cried, grabbed his leg, begged him not to leave me. Swore I didn't push her.

But he kicked me off and walked away.

I shook my head. ""He's not my family, sweetie.""

She looked sad. ""I thought maybe you had someone besides Uncle.""

I tapped her nose. ""Mommy's got you and Uncle. That's enough.""

""But Uncle's gone..."" Her lip shook. ""I miss him.""

I got it. I really did.

But disappointment? That's better than having something, then losing it.

Better than depending on someone, then having them ripped away.

I'd lived through that. I wasn't letting my daughter go through it too.

Still, I didn't expect it.

The next day, I saw Garrett.

Maya got a fever in the middle of the night.

I took her to the hospital. Bad viral infection—she had to stay for an IV.

By morning, her fever finally broke, but she was wiped. I carried her on my back and stopped at a street vendor on the way home to grab groceries.

I'd just paid when someone took the bags from me—long fingers, sharp knuckles.

I looked up. Through the early fog, I saw Garrett's face.

I was so tired I could barely think. I accidentally called him what I used to.

Then I caught myself. He didn't let me call him that anymore.

The Kingstons? Yeah, I couldn't piss them off.

Four years ago, one sentence from Garrett got me blacklisted everywhere.

""Mr. Kingston,"" I said instead.

I was too busy wondering why he was in Austin to notice how his face went stiff.

""Let me carry this,"" he said quietly.

""I'm good."" I reached for the bags but lost my balance. Maya made a sound on my back.

""Don't push yourself, Sash."" He caught my arm. ""I'll take you both home.""

Sash.

Garrett hadn't called me that in forever.

Our parents were always overseas, so Garrett basically raised me.

When he still saw me as his sister, he spoiled me.

Someone once asked if he worried I'd get him in trouble.

He'd just grinned. ""So what if she does? She wants to cause trouble, let her. Whatever happens, I'll handle it.""

But then Ivy came back.

At first, he still said I'd always be his sister.

But every time Ivy messed with me, he'd tell me to let it go.

""She's been through a lot, Sash. Just give her some space.""

He said we had to make it up to her.

I didn't want to make things hard for him. He'd been my brother for over twenty years. I wanted him happy.

So I gave in. Over and over.

Until he believed Ivy's lies without question, and I finally got it—I saw him as my brother, but he'd stopped seeing me as his sister a long time ago.

And when he took back every bit of care he'd ever given me, when I was drowning and everyone turned on me, that's when I realized how stupid I'd been to depend on him.

We didn't talk the whole ride.

Hadn't been in a car this nice in years. I felt out of place, so I just held Maya close and kept to my side of the seat, trying to figure out why Garrett was even here—

Did Cade tell him?

Was he scared I'd hurt Ivy, so he came to check?

What would he do?

Punish me for having Rhys's kid?

I didn't know. My head was killing me. I held Maya tighter, completely missing how he kept looking at me—like he'd been dying to see me.

""Sash...""

I looked up.

There were new lines around his eyes.

""Four years ago, we all thought you were...""

""Dead. I know."" I cut him off. ""And honestly, you can just keep thinking that. I'm not trying to compete with Ivy. Everything was hers anyway. I'm fine with that. You don't need to be paranoid or check on me. I just want to live quietly with my daughter.""

""And my daughter's staying with me. She's not going to Rhys. I swear I won't use her to mess up Ivy and Rhys. So relax.""

Then I looked him in the eye.

""You can really relax.""

He froze.

""I'm not—""

""Or are you scared I'll use the Kingston name? I won't. I changed my name years ago...""

""Sash!"" He cut me off, voice breaking.

His eyes were red.

""I... I want you to come home...""

I didn't get what Garrett was thinking.

I wasn't part of the Kingston family anymore.

He's the one who said so four years ago.

And what would I even go back for? To be Ivy's punching bag again?

I also didn't get why someone as rich as him had to follow me back to my tiny apartment.

I laid Maya down in bed, then headed to the kitchen. I reached for the instant coffee, then paused—no way someone like him would drink my shitty three-dollar coffee.

So I got him water instead.

He looked down at my right hand. His face did something—I couldn't tell what.

""How's your hand?""

I looked down.

My right hand—my pinky and ring finger didn't move anymore.

It happened after Ivy came back.

We went to tour one of the Kingston factories. She got curious, started talking to an engineer about machinery. To prove her point, she hit the power button on a test device.

My hand was right there.

Before that, I was a rising piano star.

It was the one thing I had over Ivy. I wasn't as smart, wasn't as capable—but piano? That was mine.

When Ivy first came back, every time I practiced, she'd sigh.

""I've always loved music. If I hadn't been switched at birth, I'd be playing piano too.""

But after that day, I couldn't perform anymore.

I spiraled. Didn't want to live.

I was sure she did it on purpose. I hated her for taking my one thing.

Until she tried to kill herself.

After they saved her, I went from victim to villain.

I remember Garrett coming back after seeing her, rubbing his face, exhausted.

""It's just piano, Sash. Just two fingers. Did you really have to push her to this?""

""Even if you can't play, even if you're not my real sister, didn't I say the Kingstons would take care of you? Why are you doing this?""

Cade was colder. ""If you hadn't been switched, Ivy would've been the one playing. You're just giving back what you stole. Why are you throwing a fit?""

They all said my hand would never heal. That crying wouldn't fix it.

But later, at Ivy's party celebrating a patent for the same machine that crushed my fingers, I heard a doctor talking to Garrett.

""I told you back then—if Miss Kingston got treatment abroad right away, she could've recovered most of the function. But you never took her. Now it's too late.""

Garrett's voice was ice-cold. ""It's better this way. Ivy always wanted to learn piano. Seeing Sash unable to play probably makes her feel better.""

""I'll take care of Sash either way. Doesn't matter if she plays or not.""

So my dreams, my future—to him, they were just tools to keep Ivy happy.

When did I start being scared of him?

Probably right then.

""I heard you're teaching music now,"" he said suddenly.

I stiffened, eyes wide.

""I only teach beginner stuff to little kids. Simple music. I don't need my ring finger or pinky for that.""

""I'm not trying to get back on stage. I'd never do anything to upset Ivy. I just need this job to feed my kid. And doctors said my hand's permanently messed up. I'll never play well again. So even if that's true, you still won't let me work?""

He froze. ""Sash, that's not—""

But I wasn't listening anymore.

The fear of having my life destroyed again hit me. I couldn't lose this job because Ivy was unhappy. So I held up my hand, showing him the fingers that wouldn't move.

""Look! I can't play anymore! I gave everything back to the Kingstons!""

""If you don't believe me, go ahead—try to move them. They don't work!""

""I was your sister for years. Can't you just let me survive?""

He jumped up, panicked, and grabbed my shaking shoulders.

""Sash, don't be scared. Please.""

""This time I'll protect you. I swear. Trust me.""

But how could I not be scared?

I'd finally rebuilt my life—the life Kai Wren traded his own for me and Maya.

""NO!""

I shoved him hard.

But the more I fought, the tighter he held me.

Hey all, was visiting for the huge Coffee Festival in your city and saw this vendor selling prints in hugely different styles, some of which were clearly AI generated. Did a quick search and saw that this isn’t their first show. I’ve also seen them at craft fairs around SF so she’s out there selling this.

I asked the vendor who the artist is, and a young woman pointed at herself. I asked if she drew it all herself, she said yes. When I asked what medium she uses, she said “all digital and collage” but insisted that she does the drawing, which is just… obviously not true. Check out the 3rd photo. The Golden Gate Bridge has a cable that vanishes into the sun.

Is this normal? I know it’s part of a larger trend of AI “art” being normalized but seeing it at a coffee event full of vendors with real heart and love for their field was… gross, to say the least. Her art had nothing to do with coffee and AI feels against the ethos of most craft shows.

Just want to vent and get perspective. Maybe writing out my thoughts will help me. I'll prolly post this on a couple of different subreddits, just to get a variety of opinions.

So, I'm struggling haha. I'm 19 and a woman btw. I really, *really* want God to exist. But I just can't get myself to believe it. Like, no matter how hard I try. The idea of a God feels so impossible. Just like the idea of existing feels impossible, but it's happening, so now I'm stuck with conundrums like this haha

So I'm trying to figure out my relationship with the church right now. I'm struggling to stay, and I'm struggling to leave. I freaking love this church. I love the members. There are a lot of super cool, hard to explain things with the book of mormon. I love going into the literary and archeological things surrounding it. Also, the church makes amazing people, and does amazing things for the world. Yes, there are some people and things that i'm kinda iffy about. I don't fully understand some things in church history, stuff with gay marriage, etc. But, I mean, I think i'd be able to cope with that if I felt like the church was true, and that God existed.

So do I leave? Do I stay? A part of me wants to go out and see what other religions have to offer. I've been a member my whole life, so I don't really know as much as I wish I did about other religions. But I'm afraid that, like, if the church really is true, and I die while I'm out learning about other religions, then I'm screwed haha. ehhhhh

Even if I do leave, i don't think a lot would change in respect to how I act. I've never really felt a desire to have s3x (I'm queer - aro/ace -- more on that later), drink, do drugs, etc. I don't think I'd start drinking coffee or tea. I'm broke lmao, and I also am really prone to addictions so I don't wanna open up that can of worms. I generally really appreciate the moral code the church offers. Be kind to people, care about people, serve others, etc. I think I'd still do that. I hope so, at least.

I really love the impact the church has in peoples lives. I can't deny the beneficial impact it's had in my life. I don't think I'd have gotten through some of the harder points in my life without the community the church has given me. I'll never hate the church. Maybe I'd disagree with some of the things it stands for, but I won't hate it. I think it helps people to come together and become better versions of themselves. I'll always be thankful for it. If I ever do have kids, I kinda want them to be raised in the church. Even if I don't believe. It just gives a really good foundation I think.

Is it weird to say that I want other people to be members, but I feel like I can't be a member myself? And that makes me feel really sad. Idk.

My biggest issue is I've never had a connection with God. I feel really empty when I pray. I feel like I'm lying about spiritual experiences and I hate being dishonest about that. I wonder how many other people are lying just to conform or because they're afraid of considering the fact that the church might not be true. I guess that's why I've always loved the testimonies of converts. They seem to be more confident.

I want *so badly* for there to be a God in heaven who loves me. I want to be able to see my family again. I want there to be someone who's guiding my life to the best path possible. But it just feels... impossible??? I'm saying that a lot but idk how else to express it. Religion feels like a coping mechanism for death and the other bad things in the world. Maybe I'm just nihilistic, idk. Or depressed. Or autistic. Or both. (I am both)

I also struggle a lot with, like, the pressure to have a family and stuff. Don't get me wrong, I really do want a family. Kind of. ish. Like I said before, I'm aro/ace and so my relationship with s3x/dating is kinda weird in general. I feel like there's such an expectation to get married and have a family. And I want an eternal partner, for sure. But more like an eternal-best-friend kind of deal, without the whole... s3x thing. I think that's the biggest lifestyle change for me if I left the church. I'd try and find another partner on the ace spectrum, probably another woman, and I'd get platonically married and have a bunch of cats or something. Maybe adopt a kid or 2. But I struggle to find a way that fits in with the church, you know?? and it breaks my heart. Genuinely, I wish that I could find another girl and we could be sealed as, like, sisters or something idk. Or eternal besties. And would that be sinning if we didn't have s3x???? :( i'm just sad and struggling. I hate feeling liked I'd be depriving a potential partner of something that's apparently so ""important"" (I've never understood why people think s3x is so important ngl) anyways this section of the rant is done

I feel like... I'm just struggling with fear in general. Afraid that the church isn't true. Afraid that it is. And I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I've been waiting on the Lord for so long, and I'm exhausted. And there are some times where I've felt slightly better about the church, but never really confident. I've never been able to say confidently that Jesus is real. That God is real. I've held on to a logical ""testimony"" for so long, and I feel like it's crumbling. Like yes, it's nice to say all of the cool connections in the book of mormon. The impressive improbabilities with how it came to exist. But it's getting to the point where that's not enough. I haven't felt good about religious stuff in years. Ever since I was a kid.

Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough. Maybe there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Maybe the church isn't true. Maybe God doesn't exist. I can come up with so many maybes, but I don't have any answers.

wellll

anyways that's my rant

it's super long haha, my bad

I would genuinely love any advice or insight from anyone.

She started dating him two years ago, and her therapist started suggesting she break up with him 6 months into the relationship, so I'm glad she's finally out of there. She's talked about getting back together with him, and I'm apparently the only person who is directly telling her that she shouldn't, especially if she's been complaining about him for over a year and a half. 

Normally she's cool, but every so often she will do something I find weird. In the past year, she has asked to take a nap at my house, she showed up to carpool to work without telling me she was going to, and she has taken unflattering photos of me and sent them to me. Sometimes, it's her sense of humor, and she will usually go a few months between these types of things, but earlier this week, she asked if I'd be interested in being her roommate even though she knew I would say, ""no."" Today, she ordered a drink and had the coffee shop print my face on it even after I told her I didn't want her to do that, she posted it on instagram, and she made very strong eye contact with me as a joke. 

I'm starting to think that these jokes are not actually jokes anymore, and I'm pretty sure I've been clear about my lack of romantic interest by having firm boundaries and denying every one of these weird requests. WIBTAH if instead of just constantly saying, ""no,"" I just directly told her I'm sensing her attraction to me and I am not interested? What is the best way to go about this?",1,1762661924.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
