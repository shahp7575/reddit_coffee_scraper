EDIZIONE DEL GIORNO

──────────────────────────────
ITALIA: L'ETÀ DELLA MATERNITÀ IN EVOLUZIONE

Negli ultimi decenni l'età media per avere il primo figlio in Italia è aumentata. Mentre negli anni ’80 e ’90 molte donne diventavano madri intorno ai 25–30 anni, oggi la soglia si sposta intorno ai 31–34 anni.  
Fattori come la ricerca di stabilità economica, l’impegno nella formazione e carriera, i mutati valori culturali e l’accesso a servizi per la fertilità contribuiscono a questo ritardo. Se da un lato si gode di una maggiore preparazione e sicurezza, dall’altro i rischi in gravidanza e parto possono aumentare.

CLIMA & AMBIENTE: IL CALDO AFRICANO E I FENOMENI ESTREMI

Le ondate di ""caldo africano"", caratterizzate da temperature che talvolta superano i 40°C, sono sempre più frequenti, con impatti sulla salute pubblica e sull’ambiente.  
Tra le conseguenze troviamo:  
– Maggiori disagi per la salute, con rischi di colpi di calore e disidratazione.  
– Aumento dell’evaporazione e rischio di siccità: fenomeni che mettono sotto pressione l’agricoltura e le risorse idriche.  
– Picchi di domanda energetica dovuti all’uso massiccio di condizionatori.  
Questi eventi estremi testimoniano la necessità di interventi e strategie per garantire la vivibilità delle città.

──────────────────────────────
CAFFÈ E GASTRONOMIA: L’ESPERIENZA DI CAFÉ KIt

Café Kit ha saputo coniugare l’amore per il caffè con un’estetica raffinata e una proposta internazionale.  
I punti di forza del brand includono:  
• Specialty coffee selezionato e preparato con cura, esaltando sfumature aromatiche uniche.  
• Una raffinata offerta di dolci e pasticcini che unisce tradizione francese e delicatezza giapponese.  
• Un ambiente curato in ogni dettaglio, dai locali agli atelier di torrefazione, presenti sia in Europa che in Giappone.  
Oltre a offrire un’esperienza in loco, Kit  garantisce la possibilità di acquistare chicchi tostati per riprodurre a casa l’eccellenza del suo caffè.

──────────────────────────────
MODA SOSTENIBILE: LA LANA DI PELO DI CANE E GATTO

Una tendenza innovativa nel mondo della moda sostenibile vede l’utilizzo della lana ottenuta dal pelo di animali domestici.  
Questo filato, ricavato eticamente e in modo responsabile, offre caratteristiche di calore e morbidezza ideali per capi d’abbigliamento personalizzati, come maglioni e sciarpe.  
Fattori trainanti sono:  
• L’interesse per soluzioni ecologiche che riducono gli sprechi.  
• L’unicità dei capi, che possono celebrare il legame speciale con i propri animali.  
Il mercato, in crescita, suggerisce che designer e marchi continueranno a esplorare e valorizzare questa materia prima alternativa.

──────────────────────────────
SPAZIO: LA VELA A LASER E I VIAGGI INTERSTELLARI

Nel campo dell’esplorazione spaziale, la tecnologia della vela a laser rappresenta un approccio innovativo per i viaggi interstellari.  
Come funziona? Una vela riflettente viene colpita da potenti impulsi di luce di un laser, generando una spinta continua che permette di accelerare la navetta senza l’esigenza di trasportare grandi quantità di carburante.  
Tra le applicazioni future:  
• Missioni verso Proxima Centauri e altri esopianeti, con tempi di viaggio significativamente ridotti.  
• Significative potenzialità nel contenimento dei costi e nell’ampliamento della nostra conoscenza dell’universo.  
Le principali sfide riguardano la precisione del laser, il materiale della vela e la gestione delle comunicazioni a grandi distanze, elementi fondamentali per realizzare il sogno dei viaggi interstellari.

──────────────────────────────
CONCLUSIONI

Dalle dinamiche sociali e culturali italiane, passando per le emergenze climatiche fino alle innovazioni in gastronomia, moda e spazio, il panorama odierno è caratterizzato da trasformazioni profonde. Questi sviluppi, sebbene diversificati, evidenziano l’interconnessione tra progresso tecnologico, consapevolezza ambientale e scelte di vita sempre più informate.

1jgabih,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiddleClassFinance/comments/1jgabih/define_middle_class_lifestyle_and_my_progress/,Define middle class lifestyle and my progress,"My wife and i are in our late 40s with no kids and combined net income no more than 100k since we have been married in 2010.  I had 25k in student debt and we were debt free prior to purchasing a $220k home in 2012. We had been making normal mortgage payments and saving to have a kid but that never happened, so we just started making extra payments on our mortgage with whatever extra leftover we had and paid off our home in 12 years.  At the same time, we weren't knowledgeable about investing but i contributed a little in my 401k.  Since 2020, we have been investing a lot more and max out both our Roth accounts and i just started maxing my 401k (wife doesn't have 401k at her job).  Currently, house is worth about $420k, $450k invested, and continuing to invest and maybe downsize to a smaller home in our mid 50s.  How do you think we are progressing so far as i feel like we are behind with retirement.

We live a simple lifestyle and don't dine out or travel much because we enjoy being homebodies.  Instead of buying coffee or buying breakfast or lunch, we make our own which saves a whole lot considering it costs around $3 for each coffee and $7 for a breakfast sandwich. The cost of tipping and the realization of dining out is outrageous. For instance, a steak dinner with 20% tip runs up to about $100 but the tip amount alone can buy you a few steaks to grill at home and you still have leftover.  As for going out to the bar, its almost $50 per head for drinks and appetizers so buying 2-3 cases of beer and ordering takeout to someone's house is so much cheaper when you roll to the bar with like 8 guys.  We have 2 credit cards for emergencies and pay in cash so we don't get out of hand with running up debts. I work in an industry where i review people's income and expenses and people really need to budget and check their finances.  People having more than 3 credit cards and spending above their means and wondering why they are in distress.  If people who are struggling pull out their last 3 bank/credit card statements and do a line item check, they can save hundreds each month if they just learn to budget and cut their expenses aka 20 starbucks and 20 fast food transactions each month.

How much income is considered to be middle class?  What kind of lifestyle do you live?  Is it travelling 2-4 times per year?  Having an expensive hobby like weekly golf outings?  Dining out multiple times a week?  Or are these the norm and considered needs and not wants?  Believe me when i say i don't have much but i enjoy my life and appreciate everything i have worked for and enjoy my simple life.

I’ve been curious about the degassing period after roasting — some say it makes a huge difference, while others enjoy trying their coffee fresh to catch the more volatile aromas. I saw that there are some small roasters that are countertop-friendly, and I’m considering getting one. The only thing holding me back is that my local coffee supplier sells raw beans at a premium, so I’m not sure if it’ll be much cheaper than buying larger batches of roasted beans.

I’m also curious about how the flavors develop over the degassing period. Some people say coffee can taste a bit “green” or flat right after roasting, while others swear by trying it fresh to experience the more vibrant notes. I imagine it could be fun to experiment — maybe pull a shot every day after roasting and see how the flavors evolve. For those who roast regularly, do you have a sweet spot for resting time depending on the brew method?

Another thing I’m wondering about is consistency. With home roasting, do you find it hard to repeat the same roast profile every time? I can see how dialing in roast levels would take practice, but it sounds rewarding to have that kind of control over your coffee. If I take the plunge, I’d love to try different origins and figure out what works best for my pour-overs and occasional espresso shots. Any advice for getting started without overcomplicating things?

My coffee brew from today: [Check it out] (https://youtube.com/shorts/MyARI_WJM2Q)— really enjoying the crema. Will the crema be the same for freshly roasted beans?

I need some advice regarding dealing with my mother with whom i disagree on many many things. I am an only son. My father is no more and I have to take of her. But i just can't take her thought process and her judgement about how I live my life.

I'll give some examples of how she thinks and what I feel about that, so that you can get an idea of what I'm talking about.

1. She doesn't eat Pani puri outside in our hometown because ""what if someone sees"". She doesn't let me wear shorts and go outside (im a guy) because people don't wear shorts here. I chafe and feel suffocated at crap like this. One thing I just detest is changing how I live my life because of what people will think, especially at a non-issue like this.

2. My cousin brother had psychological issues brought on by his grandmother's verbal abuse. She used to verbally abuse him because he was dark-skinned. And you know what the clincher is, he looked exactly like his father and grandfather. But no-one helped him or protected him the way he needed to. My aunt ( his mother, and my mom's sister) didn't protect him because she herself was a target of abuse by her mother-in-law. She was married off at 14. She had a nervous breakdown once because of the mental abuse by her mother-in-law. So she couldn't protect her children. My cousin had an episode once. And my mother advices my aunt, ""why don't you do some pujas, instead of just sitting around idle?"" And I'm seeing all this and thinking, ""don't these people see the impact of years of mental/emotional abuse? What kind of thinking is this? Are they even thinking?""

3. I got married in 2021. She came to stay with us for a few days in 2023 after my dad passed. I was WFH at that time unfortunately. One day she sat me down and started asking me about our future plans, children,etc. Then she asked me how close my wife is to her parents, how much gold she has brought and who has it, how much money they have? I got very angry and told her that i don't know and is none of our business. I told her that if she wants to think all this garbage, she is most welcome, but I will not allow her to put all this into my head, because my mental peace is most important to me. I am not the kind of guy to ask all these questions to my wife, and will never become one. I was very harsh that day.

4. During my college years, i had come home for vacation. We had gone out, and i bought a cold coffee can. Then she said, abhi coffee pee raha hai, baad mein kya piyega... I don't drink coffee or tea even today. Just cold coffee during hot days. 

5. She keeps saying I have changed after leaving home at 18 for college. I was a good boy earlier. But that's not true. With her I was a  good boy because I was craving for her approval. I tried to be good in her eyes, because I wanted to keep her happy, because she was unhappy with my father. I couldn't sustain this forever. I realised it's not my burden to bear. But because of this, now because I don't behave the way she expects me to, im not a good boy anymore.

6. I don't trust her, because she will cook up some garbage in her head, and throw it out at me, and I'm afraid if I let her thought process influence me, it will affect my relationship with my wife.

7. I had a plan to sell one property in my name and pay down payment for a place in Mumbai. But one day she asked me whose name will the place in Mumbai be? I told her it will be joint in my wife and my name. Then she asked me to keep the new place joint in her and my wife's name. I don't know why she said this, but i decided not to touch any money or property left by my maternal grandfather (my father left nothing anyway), at least till the time she's alive. Else I'll have to be obligated to her.

All these things have created significant trust issues in my mind regarding her.

But the thing is, i know she's not a bad person. It's her insecurities that make her behave in this way. Plus the company she keeps. The people she talks to are of the same kind. No discussion with those people yields any positivity.

I realise after moving out and interacting with people, how important it is for a person to have an identity beyond being someone's  wife, mother etc. I am seeing the negative effects in front of me.

But still she's my mother and I love her. I need advice on how to take care of her while protecting my mind and my marriage.",1,1742536448.0,AskIndia,0,1.0,False

Specifically the coffee table type books like 'The art of Warhammer 40,000' or 'Liber Xeneologis' where I see the book itself as a bit of an art piece, similar to a poster in a room. The default 40K logo really just spoils it for me, I think it looks out of place and a bit tacky. 

The Black library logo is fine IMO, its simple, plain and fits, but I find more often than not the 40K logo clashes with the cover art. I have backed down from buying a nice showy hardback on several occasions because of that logo and really wish they'd do prints without it, or at least have a nice subtle print logo like the black library one.

Thoughts?

\*To be clear as a logo for the game I think its fine, I just dont like it slapped on other art like a 'title' that was never meant to be.

1jg9xcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1jg9xcr/im_stuck_in_a_hellish_roundabout_of_my_own_design/,I’m stuck in a hellish roundabout of my own design.,"For most of my licensed life, I’ve never had much of a say in the cars I drove. My parents were very low income and very strict, so I just ended up driving whatever hand-me-down, clapped out GM vehicle that I would end up having to use all my part time (and eventually full time) job money just to be able to maintain in order to drive it to my clapped out part/full time job.

Eventually, I was able to graduate from the pushing the existentially crushing, Sisyphus-Ian boulder of forgoing retirement savings on maintaining high-mileage cars to forgoing retirement savings on financing a lower mileage vehicle. It was the first car I “chose”. And it was dogshit, but it was a dogshit that I finally chose to step in, and a dogshit that taught me an incredible amount about APR rates and what it feels like to be unceremoniously penetrated by them, one digit left of the decimal per hole. 

But, outside of the financing woes, it was a great value. Mainly because it was a gratuitously unarousing (although, ironically, had a small nation’s worth of once-potential babies stained deep into the passenger seat) Hyundai Elantra base with, of all things, a manual transmission, which I did not know how to drive. But I was determined to learn, because it was by far the best value I had found at the time for a used car. Learning stick is basically free, I thought.

But it turned out that I was severely wrong. Somewhere within the pretense that a car was a thing that got one from point a to b and should be the most restrained purchase one makes in their life, I ended up having fun. Which is a problem, because I then felt good, which is a problem, because I wanted to feel more good. 

I kept the Elantra for about 5 years and then I got a good career opportunity, where I could afford to buy a car that maybe I actually wanted to buy before I went searching for a new car. Now that I got a taste of rowing my own gears, I wanted something not an old, stiff, slow, feature-deprived Elantra and also something maybe with seats that had, at most, only half the set-in ejaculate. 

I’m getting tired of writing and you are getting tired of reading, so here is the financial shit-show that ensued over the next 3 years, because finally being able to drive what you want also means having to find out what you even want in the first place:

Jetta R-line: tried to find a budget-friendly balance and bought new, since the used market was insane and it made more sense to go new at the time. Loved the interior for the price point. Good amount of features for the price (sunroof/heated steering wheel/heated front and rear seats/keyless entry and push start/blind spot and autonomous breaks/auto dimming mirror), which is just about all I could ask for and the price tag was only $23.5k! Exterior was a bit understated, but I liked it. Manual transmission, enjoyed the ride quality. Exceptional gas mileage. Dumped it because I kept freaking myself out looking at VW reliability horror stories and I had three major issues that were fixed by the dealer in the 10 months I owned it. Also wanted more power, once it got to highway speeds, it just fell flat. Speakers were pretty garbage as well. 

VA WRX base: very lightly used, first time a car made me smile and giggle. I kind of understood the passenger(s) of the previous owner of my old Elantra now. Loved the feeling of being planted and confident in the awd, loved the whooosh of the turbo. Also freaked myself out with Subaru horror stories, but didn’t have any issues. Did a lot of external and interior customization, which was fun and a learning experience. Loved the look of the car, pure red and I added gloss black accents for every angle. Interior was a bit boring. Missed the features of my Jetta. Traded it in because the ride was rough and any crack in the road became an explosion in the cabin and the transmission for the manual version was not friendly for the stop and go traffic on my commute. (It never is, I know, but this was notably non-compliant) This car kind of felt like it came from an abusive relationship and just couldn’t handle peace or stability, so it created issues to make itself feel okay and familiar. But, just like an abusive relationship, probably the most fun I’ve had driving. Also helps that it is a relatively practical sedan. Gas mileage was not terrible (I do a lot of highway during the week and some backroads on the weekend). Had for about 9 months

Tesla model 3 rwd (pre-highland): got it new and wanted to jump on state and fed incentives while they existed. Smooth ride and better build quality and sound deadening than its reputation would suggest. Every feature I could want and then some. So convenient and I loved being able to control things like climate and locks and see through cameras all from my phone. Comfy and spacious inside. Maybe too spacious. The cosmic vacuum of a dashboard really was depressing at night, all you really get in terms of significant light is the giant infotainment tablet. Really easy to drive and great passing power. If I felt like crap or was tired or just focusing on the work day ahead of me, it really was a godsend. But I never really had “fun” and I missed making things hard for myself in a manual ICE vehicle. Traded in for that reason, but ultimately no major gripes. Had for about 9 months

2.4 BRZ: man(ual), did I swing for the polar opposite. Pure drivers car, really, because when I’m not driving it, I want out of it. Some kind of baffling design choices. Cup holders are far behind you; coupled with the stick shift, drinking a hot coffee becomes a high stakes game of will I spill this hot liquid on my penis or the car’s penis (shifter). No practical place to keep your phone. A lot of port-a-potty plastic. Interior is cramped, that wasn’t a surprise. Also, the car is low, so you will get hit with every vector of light from every high beam of every car behind you. You might even just get hit, period, which I did (love tap) by a lifted ram (again, no surprise) that didn’t see me at all red light because of the height difference. All of that melts away when I drive though, and it’s just so easy to manipulate the clutch and shifter. Stop and go traffic is quite bearable, the car is okay with creeping forward or being WOT and revving to high rpms is a delight. People say the ride quality is rough, but compared to the WRX, it feels fairly neutral and reasonable for the type of car it is. I don’t think I’ve even stalled once, such a delight to drive. Wish the visibility were a tad better. Not hitting the fun highs as I was in the WRX, but a consistently enjoyable driving experience.

Now I’m trading that in and I’m about to sign for a Genesis g70 first gen manual. I think I’ve learned that I want something sporty and comfortable with at least some creature comforts/tech. But I’m also realizing that maybe I have a deep seated internal issue here. Will I ever be satisfied? Will I ever put some of that money towards retirement? Is the problem that I don’t know what I want? Am I looking at the wrong cars? Is this just what car buying is like for manual transmission drivers? Do I need a new therapist? Please, Reddit, help me out before I have to shell out a copay for therapy, because I could really use that towards the premium fuel I have to fill up with.

TL;DR playing musical chairs with cars (not leasing) and ultimately wanting something lacking from each one (reliable/sporty/comfortable/some creature comforts/manual transmission). Am I asking for too much and should adjust my expectations, or is there something out there that is the perfect fit for me? About to pick up a manual Genesis g70 and don’t know if this is the right move.

1jg9whk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1jg9whk/i_24f_am_seeking_relationship_advice_possibly/,"I (24F) am seeking relationship advice, possibly AITA. I'm so lost and unsure of what I'm doing or how to proceed.","I'm just posting because I don't have a person in my life who typically gives sound advice and I'm hoping this could reach more people with various perspectives. I normally just read other peoples' write ins so please bear with me on my first post. 

I (24F) have been butting heads with my long term partner (24F) about anything related to my shitty family, to long or demanding work hours, and even my bowel movement (I'm sorry to mention this but we've had serious fights about it where she lashes out at me and calls me disgusting for shitting once a day). I'm not sure what to do and I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster of trying my best to be a good partner, trying to see my siblings here or there, taking care of general house chores/errands, and doing my best to move upward in my career. 

For further context: my partner hates my family and for very good reason. They weren't the best to me (dad is arguably an abusive narcissist, and siblings at times demanded a lot from me with little return when I needed help), but since I've not lived under my parents roof for the past year, my younger siblings have been seeking time with me like playing video games or board games. Sometimes even going out to run errands together. 

Lately my car has been breaking down and my father is very handy with cars. These fixes are quite costly to have a dealership repair and he has the tools and means to fix it. It's been racking up about $40/day to get to work and is something I can't not have. It's within my employment contract to own a car and use it for work as we have heavy tools and ladders we need to assess buildings. I've been needing to go to my family's to repair the car and it eat up time with my partner, and also makes it harder to cut ties with my parents.

On top of this, we've been under stress at work with new hires that I've been placed on demanding jobs that easily eat up 8.5-9.5 hrs every day. I'm still trying to find a way to balance the demands of my job with my life and trying to help out others on my team who are also drowning. 

She has brought up to me that we don't get much time together despite my best efforts to watch TV together, go out on walks, play a video game together, eat out at restaurants at least once a week, go out on dates, buy her gifts, or just generally be around eachother. 

It just doesn't seem to be enough and I'm not sure what to do. I took a couple days off from work to spend with her. Today I got her favourite coffee and pastries from a bakery that is no longer in our neighbour, got a carshare just to pick her up from work, and we spent a considerable about of time together before she left for her workout class and to see friends. I pick her up from her hangout and have her upset with me for wanting to play a co-op video game with my siblings for 30-45 minutes. 

She hates them so much that it feels like it may get to the point where she ultimately says to pick her or my family (which includes my siblings who seem to be turning around). She's mentioned the possibility of moving out of town and back in with her mother who lives across the country if I continue.

I just don't know what to do. This is my first relationship, and really first serious one at that. We have the same views on many things, similar activities we enjoy, and even diet (I have dietary restrictions so it's difficult to live and eat with folks who aren't open to eating the similar foods to me). I'm not sure if she's been more upset with me lately as she's been feeling the pressures of a hiring freeze (she's looking for a full time job that pays decently), and general pressures of a post-grad life.

I'm currently in a bit of a financial bind, exhausted because I have family who demand my presence every week (and hold it against me if I don't show up or prioritize them), and feel like the shittiest partner for not being able to ease my partner's stresses. I try my best to do everything I can, but it just doesn't seem like enough.

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any responses and will try my best to respond if there are any questions. I'm sure I'm missing some context clues along the way or other background information so please feel free to ask!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine waking up in a cozy retreat that merges the raw beauty of nature with sleek, modern design. Metal cabin living offers this unique combination, infusing rustic charm into contemporary architecture. These cabins aren’t just homes; they’re an experience that evokes a sense of tranquility and style.

The primary appeal of metal cabins lies in their robust construction. Made from materials like steel or aluminum, they are built to withstand various weather conditions. This durability means you can enjoy the great outdoors without worrying about maintenance. Whether it's rain, snow, or sun, metal cabins stand strong, allowing you to embrace nature's elements without fear.

When it comes to design, metal cabins harmoniously blend rustic and modern aesthetics. You can find cabins that showcase sleek lines and contemporary finishes alongside materials that reflect a more traditional, rugged look. Here are some key elements that highlight this perfect blend:

- **Exposed Metal Beams:** These add a modern twist while showcasing the cabin's structural integrity.
- **Natural Wood Accents:** wooden elements, such as furniture or wall panels, brings warmth and a handmade feel to the space.
- **Large Windows:** They not only brighten up the interior but also create a seamless connection with the surrounding landscape.
- **Minimalist Decor:** Keeping decorations simple and functional allows the beauty of the cabin and nature to shine.

Adopting a metal cabin lifestyle also means embracing sustainability. Many metal cabins are designed with eco-friendly practices in mind. You might find solar panels on the roof or rainwater harvesting systems integrated into the structure. This design approach invites you to live in harmony with nature, minimizing your environmental footprint while enjoying modern conveniences.

Furthermore, metal cabins offer versatility. You can customize them to fit your needs, whether you seek a quiet weekend retreat, a full-time residence, or a rental property. The arrangements are endless! Here are some popular uses for metal cabins:

- **Vacation Retreats:** Escape the hustle and bustle of city life.
- **Guesthouses:** Perfect for family and friends visiting your property.
- **Remote Work Spaces:** Create a peaceful environment for productivity.
- **Workshops or Studios:** An inspiring space for artists or crafters.

For those who appreciate outdoor living, incorporating porches and decks further enhances the experience of metal cabin living. Imagine sipping your morning coffee under a covered porch, listening to the rustle of leaves or the chirping of birds, all while surrounded by the natural beauty of the outdoors. These spaces become an extension of your home, ideal for entertaining guests or simply unwinding after a long day.

Metal cabins also adapt beautifully to any setting. Whether nestled in the woods, perched on a hillside, or integrated into a beach landscape, they maintain an aesthetic appeal that complements their surroundings. Depending on your location, you might choose a cabin with a flat roof for a sleek look or a more traditional gable style for that timeless feel.

Another compelling reason to consider metal cabin living is the ease of construction. Many companies now offer pre-fabricated metal cabin kits. These kits come with everything you need, simplifying the building process. With some basic skills, you could put together a stunning structure in no time. This accessibility encourages more people to embrace a cabin lifestyle, connecting them with nature without overwhelming complexities.

You may also want to reflect on how metal cabins can enhance your quality of life. The modern rustic designs promote a sense of peace and simplicity. They encourage outdoor activities, family gatherings, and a slower pace of life—all essential for mental well-being. You’ll find that living in a metal cabin allows you to escape the obligations of urban living, offering a refreshing space for relaxation and creativity.

Metal cabin living perfectly fuses rustic charm with modern sensibilities. This lifestyle embodies strength, sustainability, and style, making it a wonderful choice for anyone who craves the beauty of nature while enjoying contemporary comforts. Whether you’re considering purchasing a cabin or just daydreaming about it, metal cabins remind us that home can be both a refuge and an adventure.

The Benefits of Choosing Metal Cabins for Sustainable Living
------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing a metal cabin for sustainable living comes with a plethora of benefits. These structures seamlessly merge modern engineering with rustic charm, offering a unique living experience that is both eco-friendly and aesthetically appealing. If you're considering a shift towards sustainable living, metal cabins might just be the perfect solution for you.

One of the key advantages of metal cabins is their durability. Unlike traditional wood structures, metal cabins resist decay, pests, and harsh weather conditions. This longevity means that you won’t have to worry about frequent repairs or replacements, allowing you to focus on enjoying your living space. With proper maintenance, a metal cabin can last for decades, making it a wise investment for anyone committed to sustainability.

Additionally, metal cabins offer excellent insulation properties. The materials used in their construction can help regulate indoor temperatures, thereby reducing energy consumption. This means you can stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer without relying heavily on heating or air conditioning. As a result, you'll not only reduce your carbon footprint but also save money on your energy bills over time.

Another benefit to consider is the environmental impact of metal cabins. Metal is one of the most recyclable materials available. When using steel or aluminum, you're supporting a recycling process that has minimal negative effects on the environment. Many manufacturers use recycled materials in their production, further decreasing the ecological footprint of your home. Choosing a metal cabin not only supports sustainable construction practices but also promotes a lifecycle that values repurposing and recycling.

In terms of design, metal cabins can be customized in various ways without compromising their sustainability. You can choose from multiple colors, finishes, and designs to create a unique living space that reflects your personal style. The versatility of metal as a construction material means you can create both the rustic feel you love and the modern comforts you need.

Metal cabins also often come with pre-fabricated options, which can be assembled quickly and efficiently. This means less waste during construction and a faster move-in time for you. Many companies offer kits with everything you need to create your new home, making it easier for you to take control of your sustainable living journey.

Another important aspect is that metal cabins are generally fire-resistant. This is a significant advantage in areas prone to wildfires or extreme weather. Safety is a priority for any homeowner, and choosing a metal structure can give you peace of mind knowing your home has enhanced fire safety features.

When considering your surroundings, metal cabins can integrate beautifully into natural landscapes. Their sleek, modern look stands out without being intrusive, allowing you to enjoy the beauty of nature around you. This connection to the outdoors can enhance your overall living experience and promote a more harmonious lifestyle.

Moving towards sustainable living also often includes aspects of self-sufficiency. Many metal cabin owners choose to incorporate solar panels or wind turbines to power their homes. This further reduces reliance on traditional energy sources, allowing you to truly live off the grid. Pairing solar energy with the efficiency of metal construction can result in a nearly self-sustaining lifestyle.

- **Durability:** Metal cabins withstand the elements better than many traditional structures.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Great insulation properties help reduce energy costs.
- **Eco-Friendly:** Metal is recyclable and often made from repurposed materials.
- **Customizable:** Tailor your cabin’s design to suit your aesthetic preferences.
- **Safety:** Fire-resistant features make them a safer option in vulnerable areas.
- **Quick Assembly:** Prefabricated options minimize waste and construction time.
- **Integration with Nature:** They blend well within natural environments.
- **Self-Sufficiency:** Opportunities for renewable energy integration.

Metal cabins present a fantastic option for those looking to embrace sustainable living. By investing in one, you not only choose a durable and efficient structure but also contribute positively to the environment. Whether you envision a cozy getaway in the woods or a modern home on a spacious lot, metal cabins offer the perfect blend of rustic elegance and modern functionality. As you make plans for your sustainable future, consider the many advantages that metal cabins have to offer. You might just find that it's the perfect choice for your lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Metal cabin living stands at the crossroads of rustic charm and modern convenience, offering a unique lifestyle that resonates with many. By blending these two aesthetics, metal cabins create spaces that are not only visually appealing but also functional. Their sleek lines and contemporary design elements make them a standout choice for those who appreciate modernity, while features like wooden accents and nature-inspired motifs maintain a warm, inviting atmosphere reminiscent of traditional cabins.

Opting for metal cabins brings a multitude of advantages, particularly when it comes to sustainability. Made from recyclable materials, these structures boast exceptional longevity and durability, reducing the need for frequent replacements. Metal cabins are also designed to withstand various weather conditions, ensuring energy efficiency and lower utility bills. With proper insulation, they naturally regulate temperature, which means you can stay cozy in winter and cool in summer while minimizing your ecological footprint.

Adopting a metal cabin lifestyle is not just about choosing a home; it’s a commitment to living harmoniously with the environment. You can personalize these spaces to reflect your style, whether through modern embellishments or rustic décor elements. The perfect mix of rustic and modern aesthetics allows for endless design possibilities, making metal cabins a versatile option for both full-time residents and weekend getaways.

If you're considering a new living arrangement, exploring the world of metal cabin living might just inspire you to make a change that is aesthetically pleasing and environmentally responsible. Embrace the comfort and style that comes with this innovative approach to home design, and let your metal cabin be a sanctuary where modern life meets the enduring essence of nature.",1,1742535762.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1jg9uaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1jg9uaf/diet_and_exercise_recommendation/,Diet and Exercise Recommendation,"Hello everyone!

I've gained a large amount of weight after starting my new job and it has affected my self-image in a negative way.

I used to be a very slim person, I usually did minimal exercise but somehow managed to stay trim and thin. However, when I starting my new teaching job at Uni, nobody warned me about all the eating that would be involved. I've been teaching for about 3 months now and I've gained over 9kg in that amount of time, you can really tell from how round my face has gotten. 

I have coworkers and superiors who always bring in something for the department like a whole bag of baked goods, leftovers from big family celebrations, fruits and produce from those of us who owned agricultural property etc., and I also have students who come in and have their own little celebrations and they save me the odd slice of pizza or two, hell one even gave me two whole bags of cookies after experimenting with her roommates in the new dorm ovens. This doesn't even include all of the functions and events that we're made to attend. They usually involve a buffet and an open dessert bar as well, just last month we had about 4 such events in as many weeks. I know that some of you will say that I should just say no/politely decline when being offered food but as one of the junior faculty (the youngest among us), I feel like it would be an insult if I didn't at least grab one piece of cake when the senior faculty call me over to eat, likewise I don't want to come off as a snob to my students when they very much made the effort to save/make the food for me.

But now I had to go up a size when I went shopping with my friends last week and when I primp in the mirror before going to work I notice that a double chin in starting to form. It's not devastating but it IS upsetting. I can't even exercise because anything beyond mild cardio triggers my asthma. Here's what I usually eat in a day.

Breakfast:  
\- Two egg sandwiches with a slice of cheese each and black coffee  
  
Lunch:  
\- A cup of rice and any assorted meat side dish that they sell in the canteen and a bottle of apple/orange juice  
  
Office Snack:  
\- A pastry (if my coworkers brought any) and a cup of coffee from my own stock in the pantry

Supper/Dinner:

\- A cup of rice, assorted meat side dish, a portion of vegetables, water/juice, and whatever dessert we have at home, usually a slice of cake.

Any advice? For the exercise portion the best I can do is an hour-long walk per day after work. I can't go to the gym during the weekends because I'm also taking post grad studies at the same university I work at. Any advice at all would you much appreciated.

I finally added him on Instagram today, but now I’m wondering—should I message him and ask him to grab coffee? Or would it be too weird since my mom has kind of played matchmaker here? He obviously knows who I am since he works with my mom, but I don’t want to come off as awkward.

I have worked at this job from trainee to Team Leader, switching from trainer to management. I have juggled multiple jobs at times (subsitute teaching, chess coaching), juggled an internship (Defense Attorney), and juggled my education (Philosophy major). I will be leaving Chick-fil-A to pursue my J.D. after a stressful application process. 

I often times joke about my job, my distaste for my labor, my frustrations about pay, my unwillingness to yield to certain requests, my interactions with guests have had their extreme moments from vile language and physical moments to lies about food and attempt to ‘trick me‘ into providing free sandwiches.   
  
I don't regret what I have said and done at this job. All the jokes and humor were my act of coping. But I do want to acknoledge all the good that has happened. 

When I started at Chick-fil-A I was in a mentally unstable situation. I had few good, deep friendships, I had no social skills, I lacked speaking capability, I was withdrawn, timid, shy, nervous, sweaty-palmed, eye-avoiding, childish, wannabe grownup. I lacked initative, drive, focus, commitment, dedication, awareness, control, and leadership. 

Chick-fil-A gave me an outlet to learn these things. I grew and developed into who I am today as a team leader. I remember having a conversation with my Leader after I was passed for a promotion to team lead two years ago that my friend recieved, he told me he was always in my corner and proud of me. I remember crying on the shoulder of a co-worker when I heard anther co-worker I barely knew died. I had deep friendships. They might not remember these moments but I do. 

I am outgoing and talkative now, I have found courage in myself, I want to help people, I want to grow people, I want what is best for people. And yes, I still joke at work, and thats just part of the downside of the outgoing part.

I am thankful for Chick-fil-A, and encourage those who are willing to stick it out to really work hard, try your best, it does have its benefits even if you dont feel it in the day to day. You will look back even over the course of a year and see how far you have come. 

Thank you Chris, my manager who believed in me. Alana, for being my friend who was always first to the promotions and the first to still call about work gossip. Marc, for being my buddy and buying us coffee for the truck shifts. Karina, for always telling me you don't hate me, although I am terrified of being judged by you. Cameron, for teaching me what it must have felt like to mentor myself (exhausting).   
(Notice I don't commend or remember my executives or my Operator, no love lost there.)

I really do love Chick-fil-A, I am going to miss it, a lot. The 4:45 clock-ins. The night shifts I used to pick up. The times I took home cherries so we didn't waste them and now I have stains in my car still from them. The guests who berated me weren't that bad when I remember the guests who shake my hand and tell me they are proud of me and that I'm going places, when they don't even *know* who I am. I'll miss the breakfast rush, followed by the slow stillness of 11-12, only to be rammed into by the 12-1:30 rush. I'll miss watching the moon, when I run orders to parked cars, become the sun. I'll miss the rain making the days slower because people don‘t want to leave their house. I'll miss my friends, and I hope I keep a few. Chick-fil-A has always been a home for me since I started working, I have always felt safe there, and often enjoyed it sincerely, so, I'll miss Chick-fil-A.

Teas, coffee, chocolate, guarana, etc. Last time I had any of those was 3-4 months ago. It sucked a ton in the first weeks, I felt like a meth addict in recovery. It got better quite fast after that though! Around that time I started to discover the true power adaptogens have, while I was looking for some alternative to give me energy. I've tried a few things that work amazing for me:

Siberian ginseng. Amazing for energy, physical performance. Great for daily use. I was also having some anemia issues and ginseng just pushed me through all the dips in energy caused by the caffeine withdrawals and low iron stores. I take 500-1000mg worth of ginseng per day, 5 days on, 2 days off to reduce tolerance. 

Rhodiola rosea. I love it more than ginseng - alongside a strong energy boost it also acts as an anti-depressant, I notice my mood is elevated alongside my cognitive performance. However for me personally it's too stimulating for dialy use, even though I take a low dose  of the extract - 200mg. Adaptogens stack in the body and for me if I take rhodiola rosea as much as I take ginseng my sleep starts to suffer. Having that said, I find that rhodiola is incredible for physical performance, especially for long distance running. I've run a marathon on and off rhodiola and got a 20% better time on rhodiola than I did just on caffeine at that time. 

Ashwagandha. Everyone here knows about it, so I won't talk about it much. Helps ground down the more stimulating adaptogens I just described, improves sleep. I take a lower dose of 400mg daily. 

To conclude, adaptogens in my opinion are severely underrated in terms of stimulation. To be honest after being caffeine-free and using adaptogens instead, I feel that caffeine is a scam. It drains the body, creates a dependance, gives a short, strong and lame, anxiety fueled energy boost. While adaptogens give a steady boost, no dependance, improve cognitive performance, creative flow, reduces systemic inflammation and the worst they can do to your body is mess with your sleep a day or two. Throughout the day I feel peaceful, healthier, creative and full of energy without any dips, unlike when I was on caffeine - full of anxiety, impatiently waiting for my dose. 

Caffeine is a working bee drug. If you're comfortable with being that, good. If you want to know how what else is possible, I strongly recommend getting off that stuff. ",8,1742535191.0,NooTopics,4,0.9,False

1jg9miz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1jg9miz/dating_app_rawview_for_the_average_sg_guy/,Dating App Rawview for the Average SG guy,"Today officially marks my one-month reusing Dating apps as, my title reads, an average 30s SG male. 

Seeing frequent Dating-related posts here and other Singapore Reddit groups, as well as Kopi Date ads popping up my social media feed prompted me re-opening Pandra's box and try them again, after ""retiring"" for five good years.

What's more? Paid for additional features, like unlimited swipes and seeing who likes my profile before matching them.

So, here's my rawview (especially for new apps like Bumble, Hinge, and Boo):

Bumble: Most legit app, having most matches and only encountering one scammer. But, conversations didn't last after fourth exchange (at most) before being ghosted. Also, got quickly unmatched a few times, likely as I got ""accidentally"" swiped right.

Coffee Meets Bagel: Second most number of matches, but beats Bumble with longer meaningful conversations lol. However, still ghosted by everyone. 

OkCupid: Just a handful of matches with immediate ghosting. Also, found many foreigners strangely liking my profile. Obviously, didn't match with them as they held a number of red flags. Another interesting observation is it generally consists of 20-30yr olds.

Tinder: 1 match with immediate ghosting. Like OkCupid, found a number of potential matches I completely avoided

Boo: Stopped after fourth day as only guy ""friends"" liked my profile instead of women. In case you don't know, Boo has this weird feature letting you ""blue-heart"" people as ""Friends"" while ""Pink Hearts"" mean dates. I'm open to friends, but using blue hearts is just weird since I'm a straight guy. 

Hinge: Best. Recreated my account four times in two weeks (as the app somehow keeps deleting it), before being permanently banned. Honestly, not sure why but I think the app did so as ""filtering"" users with little to no matches. Only had three matches, with one quickly unmatching after realising I wasn't a Pilot(as she initially thought from one of my prompts saying ""Flying is my superpower"")   

 Overall, the ""landscape"" has become slightly more legit, mainly with Bumble and Coffee meets Bagel having the ""least sus"" interfaces and most Singaporeans (at least those my age). 

I also enjoyed talking to new people, though it was overall short-lived.

As such, the average guy still won't benefit much as they're also dating apps, raising anyone's expectation to swiping and talking to the next more successful chaz.

All in all, don't invest too much hope and join interest groups for more meaningful meetings instead. Leave these apps to the ""pros"" (e.g., pilots, business owners, lawyers, bankers, doctors, software engineers) who'll actually connect with others.   

Anyone else will just get scammed or have ""swole"" fingers from endlessly swiping. 

Likewise, I'm finally ending my ""experiment"", starting with not paying anymore and deleting these apps after today. 

It was fun, but only wanted to try them out. ",26,1742534859.0,SingaporeRaw,18,0.91,False

an older man was inside buying coffee. he saw me shivering and asked if i was okay. i told him my situation, half-expecting him to just nod and leave. instead, he bought me a hot drink, sat me down, and told me to wait inside while he made a call. ten minutes later, his daughter pulled up. she was a few years older than me and offered to drop me home since she was heading in that direction.

on the ride home, i kept thinking about how easy it would have been for them to ignore me. but they didn’t. they saw a kid stuck in the cold and helped, no questions asked. i never got their names, but i think about them every winter. sometimes, kindness from a stranger is the only thing keeping you going.

1jg9kaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jg9kaj/aitah_for_wanting_to_drop_a_friend_of_5_years/,AITAH for wanting to drop a friend of 5+ years because she got skinny,"I know the title sounds like projecting, but this is my first post so I thought it would attract attention because I need to know if I'm the asshole.

I, 19 (F), and my best friend Joy (fake name) 21(F), have been friends since freshman year. We weren't always close, but after dealing with an abusive friend forcing group dynamics and such, we became closer; Sorta finding solace in each other and trauma bonding.

To give some context, when we began to grow our friendship we were both sorta midsize, but she was always slightly thinner than me. This wasn't an issue with me at all, because she understood my health issues and accepted me. I finally found a genuine friend who supported me no matter what. We would often get people calling her the prettier best friend and some of my exes even dated me to get closer to her, but I never resented her because it wasn’t her fault and she always took my side and supported me. At the end of high school she got surgery to lose weight because her mom was worried about her health and thought it could also boost her confidence and I helped her during recovery. I accommodated meals out to her diet and even made her meals while also helping her with homework. 

Now this is where I might be the asshole; About half a year ago she lost even more weight, and I was happy for her because, I too, was losing weight since I got a life-saving surgery, so we were getting healthier together. However, with more weight she lost, the more she leaned into the fat-to-fatphobic pipeline and I started to feel like her pet. The real issue is her getting skinny, the issue is all the other red flag behaviors she began to **accumulate** after she got skinny.

(The importance and impact of the listed issues are out of order, so some seem petty and others are genuine problems.)

One thing that stood out very quickly was her saying insulting things about fat people without realizing it: It was often unprovoked and so random that my other friend, let's call her Carol, would exchange glances. Stuff like ""I'm *actually* attracted to a fat guy for once"" like she wanted a gold medal. Or when we would get attention from strangers in public, she would turn it around and say the attention was for “everyone”. However, when we would go out she would call out any guy she thought was ""looking at her"". And denying any fact that he was looking at one of us or even BEHIND us. Not her. They were fathers to young teenage boys with girlfriends. She even went as far to say “that guy wasn’t looking at you” when I finally had the courage to tell the group a guy waved and winked at me. It was happening so often that I started to wonder if they were actually looking at her or if it was a power trip. My friend Carol even said she noticed it, but she might just be agreeing with me because she’s known me longer. Joy claims she doesn't like attention but then switches up to saying she is so attractive, that she catches guys emotionally cheating on their girlfriends to look at her. It’s odd.

Another issue (that literally happened yesterday) was that whenever I go out with another friend, and even after I invite her to join us and she denies, she spams me while I'm out as if she's experiencing FOMO. This happens. Every. Single. Time. And it's often after weeks to a month of not talking or texting me. And suddenly she wants my attention when I'm finally with someone else. But, she doesn’t ask me to hang out. Ever. She texts me saying she misses me and waits for me to ask and then denies any day or plan that I choose because she’s “drained”. And instead of coming up with a date and plan of her own, she just makes me run a spiral until she picks a good day and activity for her.

3. Now this is the biggest red flag she has (saved the best for last). This is where it becomes more deep-seated rage, and where I started to realize she has a boundary issue and sees me as a pet; During quarantine, I developed a really bad drinking habit and went to AA meetings and accepted that I'm an alcoholic and addict. She obviously knew all of this (at some point, because I was insecure about telling her because I thought she wouldn’t believe me) and she kinda ignored the news at first and after I repeated it a second time, she accepted it. However, now that she's skinnier she's also starting to drink more because she’ll get drunk easier. However, she does it around me because we're ""so close"". I've told her repeatedly I cannot be around certain types of alcohol because it can trigger a relapse. I don't even go near coffee or energy drinks because anything can cause me to fail. I explained it was one of my steps, but whenever we go out to eat with her mom (which is often) she gets a drink and her mom even goes to tell me to try some (her mom knows about my sobriety, she just doesn’t believe them). So not only do I have to accommodate my eating habits, what I wear, and my schedule, I also need to deal with my sobriety on my own time. 

I'm starting to feel like a chihuahua in her bag, as I have to cancel appointments and accommodate my schedule to even hang out with her. which was one of the biggest reasons I began to notice her bratty and dare I say selfish and spoiled behavior. It wouldn't be a problem if she had stuff going on, but when I had a job (I'm recovering from surgery) she would ask me to hang out with her after my shift and I would say, because I obviously wanted to hang out with my friend; But if she even had one morning class, she wouldn't even try to hang out with me because she was ""so drained"". It seemed I was the only one putting in effort. Talking about effort, she also always seems to dress down at the last minute when we plan on dressing up to go out and hang out. I don't know if this is an issue but it is to me because I end up looking like a ridiculous jackass looking for all the attention on me, all alone in public. I would like to share the attention with my friends and their amazing outfits; But she didn't even bother to dress up for my birthday because she was, again, ""drained"".

Also, this is so small, but she's also always doing homework when we hang out (we’re in college. I’m in a university and she’s in community so her classes are everyday; She tends to have more homework I guess). It's more of a pet peeve than a red flag I think but let me know because I'm not sure.

I just feel like I'm just complaining at this point about small things and maybe I should suck it up because that's how all people are. Maybe I am projecting just because she's skinny since I've never noticed these things before, but I was sure she never did any of these things before. And before anyone says anything, I have discussed these things with her. I've done all the steps you're supposed to do before breaking up a friendship. I told her my issues, made new friends and took a break from her, and she seems to continue doing them. So should I drop her, or am I just projecting? So, AITA?

The week after this my life was flipped. 



I started noticing the changes in small ways at first—whispered phrases under her breath, strange symbols drawn in the margins of her notebooks, candles burnt down to stubs in our bedroom while she claimed she never lit them. But then, the shifts became undeniable. She stopped talking about therapy, stopped mentioning the postpartum depression at all, as if it had simply disappeared. Instead, she spoke of something else—something older, something that could ""fill the spaces"" where the pain lived. I found books hidden beneath our bed, pages worn from too much handling, filled with incantations in languages I didn’t recognize. And then there were the nights—those unbearable, suffocating nights where I’d wake to find her sitting upright in bed, motionless, her lips moving in silent prayer to something unseen. She was inviting something in. She wanted to be taken, to be emptied, to be erased. And the worst part? It was working. The woman I loved was slipping away, and in her place, something else was watching me from behind her eyes.



I woke to the feeling of warm breath against my ear, the soft hush of my name slipping through the dark like a thread unraveling. Her fingers were on my chest, featherlight, moving in slow, deliberate circles.



""Breathe,"" she whispered, her voice barely more than a sigh. ""Deeper now… let it in.""



My body felt heavy, as if the weight of the room itself was pressing down on me, sinking me into the mattress. I tried to shift, to turn toward her, but I couldn’t. My limbs were stone, my breath shallow.



""Deeper,"" she coaxed again, her lips grazing my skin. ""Let it take you. Let it pull you under.""



Something was wrong. My chest tightened, hollowed. The steady rise and fall of my breath became irregular, then faint, then—nothing at all. A cavity of darkness spread inside me, vast and empty, swallowing the air, swallowing me.



I wanted to scream, to move, to claw my way back to the surface, but all I could see in the abyss behind my eyes was Aston—our daughter—her tiny hands reaching out for me. And then her… the woman I had fallen in love with. The woman who used to laugh so easily, who once held me as if I were her whole world. But she was different now. She was looking at me with something unreadable in her gaze, something vast and ancient and hungry.



""You don’t need to fight it,"" she murmured, cradling my face. ""It’s so much easier this way.""



And for a moment—just a moment—I believed her.



...then it happened. I was encompassed into an abyss I never thought possible. A darkness deeper than possible. A limitless void where I sway back and forth between the fabric of reality...or what I though reality was. Reality for me was the unwavering image of my daughters hands reaching out to me for one last time.

 



I don’t know how long I drifted in the abyss. Time didn’t exist there. Only shadows, stretching endlessly. Only the echo of my daughter’s tiny hands reaching for me—never quite close enough. Only the smirk on my wife’s lips, the fragile shell of her, trapped in a prison she had invited in.



Then, suddenly, I breathed.



Air seared into my lungs like fire, my chest rising with a violent gasp as if my body had been starved for it. My vision swam, the weight of existence crashing down on me all at once. The room was the same. The bed, the sheets, the soft hum of the world outside. But something was wrong.



The air was stale. Thick with dust and something… else. Something sour. Decay.



I turned my head, and my breath hitched in my throat.



She was there beside me. Or rather, what was left of her.



The body that once belonged to my wife lay in the bed, her delicate frame sunken into the mattress, her skin tight against her bones, dry and cracked like old parchment. Dark hollows replaced the eyes I once adored, her lips frozen in that same unreadable smirk.



I scrambled backward, my pulse pounding, my mind clawing for an explanation that didn’t exist. She had been here. With me. Whispering to me. Pulling me under. And yet, she had been dead for years.



My hands trembled as I pushed myself from the bed, my body unsteady, unfamiliar. Everything felt… wrong. The walls, the air, the way my limbs ached like I had not moved in a lifetime. I stumbled through the house, my breath shallow.



The house was not as I remembered.



Dust coated every surface. The pictures on the wall—our wedding, Aston’s baby photos—were faded, edges curled with time. The fridge was empty, long since powered down, its door hanging slightly open. The air carried the silence of a home abandoned.



Then I saw it.



A small frame sitting on the coffee table, the only thing untouched by dust. My hands shook as I picked it up.



Aston.



But not the child I remembered.



She was older now. Taller. A young woman, standing in front of a house I didn’t recognize, smiling brightly at the camera. Happy. Whole. Without me.

My legs buckled, the weight of it all slamming into me.



Ten years.



I had been gone for ten years.



Not dead, not buried, not mourned. Just… forgotten. Lost in the folds of time while the world moved forward without me. While my daughter grew up. While my wife rotted beside me.



I turned, slowly, feeling the weight of unseen eyes pressing against me.



And then I heard it.



A whisper.



A breath against my ear.



""You came back too soon.""



I turned sharply, but there was nothing there. Only the lingering scent of rot and candle wax. Only the vast, empty house that had once been a home.



And the cold, unshakable certainty that the abyss had not let me go.



This whisper will forever be with me until my utter demise.

1jg9ie8,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1jg9ie8/what_are_some_unexpected_ways_small_businesses/,What are some unexpected ways small businesses have turned challenging customer interactions into marketing wins?,"# Unexpected Ways Small Businesses Turn Challenging Customer Interactions into Marketing Wins

Small businesses often face difficult customer interactions, but the most successful ones turn these challenges into opportunities for growth and positive brand exposure. Here are some creative ways they’ve done so:

# 1. Turning Complaints into Viral Moments

Some small businesses have responded to customer complaints with humor or exceptional service, leading to viral social media moments. For example, a bakery once received a complaint about a “too small” cupcake and responded by delivering a comically large one, gaining thousands of shares online.

# 2. Leveraging Negative Reviews for Transparency

Rather than hiding bad reviews, some businesses highlight them in a humorous or constructive way. A coffee shop displayed a sign that read, *“Come try the worst coffee one guy on Yelp ever had!”* This self-deprecating humor drew curious customers and built trust.

# 3. Personalizing Apologies with Thoughtful Gestures

A restaurant once resolved a food complaint by delivering a handwritten apology and a free meal. The customer was so impressed by the genuine effort that they posted about it online, turning a bad experience into free publicity.

# 4. Creating Fun Customer Challenges

A local bookstore faced criticism about its book selection and responded by launching a “Recommend a Book” challenge. Customers submitted their favorites, and the store added many to its inventory, increasing engagement and loyalty.

# 5. Using Customer Feedback to Launch New Products

When a clothing boutique received complaints about limited size options, they turned it into an opportunity to co-create a new collection with customer input. This not only addressed the issue but also built a loyal community around their brand.

# Conclusion

Challenging customer interactions don’t have to be setbacks. When handled creatively and authentically, they can enhance a business’s reputation, create shareable moments, and deepen customer loyalty. Small businesses that embrace these challenges with innovation and sincerity can turn critics into advocates and setbacks into marketing wins.",1,1742534389.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

# Context for this post:
Atrioc showed this book briefly at the start of today's stream. I had listened to it just a few months ago and I loved it and I feel the relevancy to our current times and especially topics discussed on Atrioc's stream to be extremely poignant. I am incredibly happy to see that Atrioc is reading this book and I believe he will gain a lot of perspective from it. I had actually spammed this book as a recommendation in the chat many times when he spoke on the topic of Rome, but I don't think he saw that. And just now I wrote out a few chat messages about it and Atrioc didn't read them... once again... so I felt compelled to write out my thoughts here.

For those who don't know, the book covers the slow dissolution of the Roman republic from the moment of their victory in over Carthage in the Second Punic War [**(Atrioc's reaction)**](https://youtu.be/1FjYh_YP2XE?si=uYPuTJjAwqjTSjMc)^(sorry aedish) to the moment Julius Caesar is set up to truly kill the Republic. Carthage being the other super power in the Mediterranean and the power and dominance gained by Rome after their defeat can only be described as establishing a new world order. A new Roman hegemony that would last, in an extremely powerful state, for 500 years at least. However, that power didn't last as a **democracy**^1 for very long.

The wealth that was gained for Rome in this era lead to extreme corruption at the highest levels of society. A general sense of patriotism and support for your fellow Roman was being thrown aside for blatant self interest and unchecked greed. The wealth and power gap became very extreme especially after the **wars**^2 to fully conquer Carthage and Greece. The gains from these military campaigns could even be described as *K Shaped*… perchance.

This blatantly visible and open corruption lead to a powerful opposition of populism lead by the [**Gracchi Brothers**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi_brothers) who promoted political violence and mob rule to achieve their personal agendas of land redistribution and Italian citizenship. In the process ignoring term limits and violating centuries-long precedents because they technically had the power to do so.

So what happened to them? What were the consequences for ignoring these *""sacred""* laws? Well the older Gracchi brother Tiberius was beat to death with table legs by a horde of senators and the **Pontifex Maximus**^3. The younger Gracchi brother Gaius caused such a stink after he went for his second **re-election**^4 to get a third term as Tribune that the senators declared marshal law and gave near total executive powers to **one** man. Do what must be done. Ignore any laws. Fix this. He marched onto the Aventine hill with a militia and declared that he would pay a bounty for Gaius' head weight in gold. He either committed suicide or was murdered. His head was recovered. His brain was removed and his skull was filled with molten lead to increase the weight. The bounty was honored, as if that word still ment anything anymore.

If you're still reading this ummm.... Glizzy, Coffee Cow, Spoontrioc, Glizzy

# Death of the Republic:
##### *“The republic is nothing, a mere name without body or form.""* -JULIUS CAESAR

The damage these particular events caused to the social order was completely irreparable. A line was crossed and the state could never go back to what it used to be. Once the illusion of laws being real was shattered and everyone realized that the sword was *in fact* much mightier than the pen, ambitious men began dreaming bigger. No longer was the ultimate dream to serve the greater empire, the dream was now to be greater and have the empire serve you. Once the army became a profession where you could make money instead of a duty that you felt compelled to do for your country, it was only a matter of time before a charismatic general leveraged the booty he won for his force to gain power beyond measure. No, not quite Caesar yet. His name was [**Gaius Marius**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius). He held the Consulship (Co-Commander and Chief of the Roman Army) for an unbelievable **SEVEN TIMES**. Once as a normal one year term for a campaign he promised would be incredibly easy and take a month (it took 3 years). Then 5 times in a row. Then one final dunk just to fulfil his own ego. Not a joke. He keeled over dead less than two weeks after beginning his seventh Consulship. He just wanted to prove he had that dog in him. In this case ""that dog"" was a mock election that was brutally undemocratic and it was followed by massive political purges of the opposition. In this case the ""opposition"" were the supporters of another powerful general. [**Sulla**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla).

Yes. He gets the one name treatment. Sulla was the hammer that would be used to swing that final nail. Sulla came back to Rome with a giant army after a major victory to take back what was *his*. His main rival, Marius, was dead and there was **virtually**^5 nothing standing in his way. He marched on Rome and forced the humbled Senate to make him **Dictator**^6 for life. He completely reshaped the Roman Political system, gutting the power of the People's Assembly, ""empowering"" the Senate, increasing the minimum age requirements for all major offices of the **Cursus Honorum**^7. His goal? To make what he himself accomplished impossible. After establishing his own system by bypassing any laws in his way. He, unbelievably, resigned his position as Dictator for life. His goal was genuinely to ""fix"" the dying republic and set it on the right track. His track. He, of course, still ran for election for one last Consulship and won it, just to prove he still had that dog in him, but after that he completely relinquished power. Retiring to a farm land with his wife where he died shortly after.

At one point, before his death, he met a young man. He was the nephew of his long dead rival. He said of him he saw ""Many a Marius"". That young man was, of course, Julius Caesar. He died believing his reforms would lead to another golden age of stability for the Republic. He couldn't possibly have fathomed how far from reality his hoped truly were. How, less than a century after his death, a system of one man rule would entrench for over a thousand years. How quickly the Senate would turn into a complete joke; a social club for the rich elites who couldn't hold power if it was literally handed to them.

# Allusions to America:

This part will be the shortest. Talking about History is all fun and games until we start to acknowledge that our time will one day be looked upon by future humans and judgments will be made that we will be far too dead to argue. But for now you're plenty living, plenty capable of arguing and I don't want that smoke. In my eyes, some comparisons of the decline of the Roman Republic and the American Republic are obvious. How a hegemony was established after a great war. How political elites used their position for their own gain leading to bad actors skirting tradition by playing to popular demand of the disenfranchised, permanently eroding what was seen as unshakable tenants of society. I think it's important to look at our past and see the heights we can reach and also what we are capable of screwing up. I hope in reading this, you gained a new perspective on where things in our world may be heading. I really hope you take the time to read or listen to The Storm Before the Storm.

Brandon, if you read this, thank you for all the amazing content you create and the nuanced takes you have on the current state of the world. I was listening to your stream the whole time I was writing this. Also thank you for unintentionally following my recommendation, I'm very glad you're reading such an excellent book about a criminally under discussed part of Roman Republican History. Hopefully this will encourage you to read my messages more (usr: ""adaves""), though I wouldn't blame you if had your fill of my words for a lifetime. Now go drink some coffee because I know for a fact you've been feening for the cup this whole time. The cow can't put it down can he?

# Footnotes:
***Democracy***^1: The Romans didn't consider themselves to be living in a democracy and the republic was by no means a *true* democracy. The senators were not elected representatives and in fact were straight up oligarchs who had their position purely from wealth. It was literally a class of wealth. If you became rich enough, you would become a senator automatically. I don't want to make it seem like there was no ""democracy"". There was a lot of public participation in governance from the general population (Male Roman Citizens) and they did vote on many things. The Roman Republican system would best be described as a finely tuned balance of **Monarchy** (Elected Consuls), **Oligarchy** (Rich Senators), and **Democracy** (The People's Assembly).

***Wars***^2: The wars in question are the [**Third Punic War**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War) and the [**Achaean War**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_War).

***Pontifex Maximus***^3: The highest priest of the Roman Religion. Yes. This guy was clubbed to death by a Pope dressed as a wizard.

***Re-Election***^4: Traditionally, all elected offices in Rome can only be held for just **one** term of **one year**. The letter of the law said you simply weren't allowed to run again within 10 years. In reality, this 10 year rule was rarely used and most of the time a person never ran again.

***Virtually***^5: Marius had a Co-Consul, as was standard, and that guy tried to hold a last stand against Sulla. He marched his soldiers so hard and so fast to try and catch Sulla that they mutinied and killed him. 

***Dictator***^6: This isn't a turn of phrase like ""He's such an evil authoritarian leader! He's a Dictator!"". No. Dictator was a literal position in the roman political system. That's where we get the word. In ancient Rome, ancient even compared to these times, a Dictator would be chosen by the Senate to have supreme authority in a crisis where there wasn't any time to discuss possibilities and action was necessary. A very important note was this office came with a 6 month maximum time limit. Marvelously, it was respected basically every time and almost every dictator gave back absolute power completely willingly.

***Cursus Honorum***^7: Roman military corporate ladder. Delaying each stage made it harder for a single man to quickly snowball his influence and power to tyrannical status.",2,1742534268.0,atrioc,0,1.0,False

1jg9ft2,https://www.reddit.com/r/returnToIndia/comments/1jg9ft2/feeling_stuck_between_wanting_to_pursure_life_in/,Feeling stuck between wanting to pursure life in US VS moving back to India,"Sorry for this is going to be a long post. Thanks for reading!

I am a 34m who moved to the US about 9 years ago for masters just like many other Indians for better life. After my masters, I got a job in a small company and learned a bunch and landed a better job two years later. I’ve been working at that same company for the past 5+ years and make low six figures in a tier 1 city. Started out very very low.

A little about my past in India. I come from a middle class family and finances were always a problem in my family. My parents worked very hard to provide for me and my sibling. But even then, life was tough, and that’s an understatement. I never was able to make many friends back home and life in India in general just felt like wasn’t for me. I couldn’t connect with most people and family was really the only thing I had, besides a couple friends. I also didn’t like the mentality of most people in India. It was very conservative for me. So I decided to move abroad and make a new life for myself. (Please no need to be rude, that’s just my younger self’s opinion. I was a reserved kid)

But when I movd out here, my personality opened up and I made a ton of friends in my masters. Indian, non-Indian, American, all kinds. For some reason, I didn’t understand the different lifestyle of Indian students I was with either so I started making more non-indian friends from my college. And it was great for a while. I partied hard, enjoyed my life for the second year of my masters program and then a few months until I got a job. Then during my job, I met a few more Americans & Asians (non-indians) at work and became really good friends with them. Everything was going great, and I was enjoying life very much. I still had a couple of Indian friends (from masters) during this whole time that I hungout and partied with in my city. 

I moved from my college town to the city and that’s when slowly some of my American friends I made during my masters started drifting away except like 3 of them. One of them lived in suburbs so I didn’t see him often. But fortunately a couple of them also moved to the city so I kept hanging out with them and they had a bigger circle so I got in on that as well and it was fun. I even lived with non-indians so that added a couple of people in my life as well. 

I tried dating in the city and initially it was tough but I kept trying and got better at the dating situation and met a few nice women and had a few good dates, and mini relationships. My life was basically work, hanging out with those friends (mostly non-Indians, and a couple of indians friends), and dating. Things were good until this point.

But then covid happened and ruined most of the relationships I had. But it also brought good in my life. My last date (with an non-indian woman) turned into more than a fling.

A few months later, we were together and liked each other a lot. A couple years fast forward, I took her to India to meet my family and they liked each other as well and we got engaged when we got back to US. The year next to it, we got married, first in US then in India. While this was all fun and amazing, other things got complicated by this point. 

Throughout this whole thing, I lost a lot of those friendships due to covid, and distancing, and that made me realize that the relationships we make as Indians are very different than the relationships people make here. I long for close relationships and I regret losing all those Indian connections I had. Friends here in US, and relatives I lost touch with since I moved out.

Most friendships here are kind of transactional, even with Indians a lot of times actually. That left me emotionally very lonely. Funny enough, my wife feels the same way as well. Her family isn’t very close or nice so it’s basically us in the city, and a few friends that we see maybe 2-4 times a month if we’re lucky to make those plans happen. The visa struggles do not help either. They are a pain in the a$$. Luckily I got my GC recently, but it’s come at the worst timing honestly.

This has led us to want to move to a different place but we’re not sure where to. Obviously one of the places we’re considering is my home, India. She is scared about it but is open to it if it gives us a better life. And with all the political drama here, she herself is more inclined to leave this country. But to be honest, I don’t know if I want to. I miss my parents so much that I could cry rn. But moving back to life in India is kind of scary to me. I never really enjoyed there as a kid, and it’s weird because I have such beautiful memories with my family. But maybe that was because we were financially poor for most of my childhood (the hardships I mean). I believe somewhere in my head, there is some miscommunication lol. But then again, India is not what it used to, from what I hear and what I’ve experienced during my visits.

Another thing is that I have more money now than my family has ever had. And honestly I don’t have that much, so that speaks volumes lol. Point being, my mind wonders if living in India with a bit more money than I had would be better??

Coming to the point finally. Thanks for staying with me so far!!

I would like to know where in India can we move to, and make a decent living. I am a software engineer and my wife is in a very niche field so we’re not expecting for her to find a job in her field in India. These are the things I would like to know:

1. Where can we move to in India and have a decent job in tech?
2. How much salary can I expect for a senior software engineer role?
3. How is the work life balance there?
4. Which cities have a good social circle for people in their mid 30s or late 30s?
5. Security and safety is one of our biggest concerns. Especially for women. We want to have kids and I don’t want to have to cage my future daughter in the house or limit them with stupid shit that people do in India with women. 
6. How much money does one need to live a good life that can include good education for children, safe and social society to live in, good healthcare, decent parks and outdoors, have a decent sized house, be able to travel 2-3 times a year (Domestic and international), and not have to work stupid hours or Saturdays?
7. We both like to do our chores ourselves but a little help here and there would be helpful. So that’s a factor but not mandatory. 
8. We have two kitties, so places that has good pet care available would be a plus.
9. My wife is open to the idea of opening a small business, maybe a coffee shop. How much money would that take to start?
I know this was a lot but thank you so much for reading through this long a$$ post. I’d appreciate any help!",0,1742534113.0,returnToIndia,6,0.4,False
1jg9f71,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1jg9f71/panic_attack_at_hospital/,Panic attack at hospital,"I feel like I just need to get this out there to somebody. My wife just started her radiation therapy today. The attendant gave me instructions to go to the hospital information desk (upstairs from the radiation place) to ask my questions regarding parking and group counseling. In the meantime, they took my wife in to start her first session. 
As I began walking away, I became acutely aware of the environment: clinical, cold but welcoming, PA system going off buzzing this and that information, signs lit up green saying ""radiation in progress"", and I just detached. My heart began beating really hard, I started breathing heavily, tears rolling down my cheeks, wanting the ground to open up and swallow me whole, thinking back to what is in store for my wife for the next 5 weeks... Just wave after wave of panic crashing into me like a stormy beach. I kept walking and trying to breathe, just kept trying to push through the feelings. I finally got upstairs, and began to calm a little, wiped my tears, as I saw people ahead. Got to the information desk, then grabbed a cookie and coffee before making my way back downstairs to the radiation area. Some of those feelings started up again but to a lesser degree. I sat down and had the cookie and distracted myself with a mobile game. 
I don't know if this was a one-off, or if I'm going to associate the hospital with these feelings. I'm hoping that it wasn't (time will tell). 
I don't want to tell my wife -- she's going through enough already but she knew something was off about me after her session. I don't want to dump this on her, though. Yes I am seeing a counselor (I emailed him about it this evening). 
I'm just wondering if anyone can relate, and if so, what are some strategies that have worked for you? 
I want to be there for my wife, but I don't want her to get the worst version of me. 
Any thoughts, common experiences, or tips would be appreciated. ",2,1742534049.0,CancerFamilySupport,0,0.75,False

My wife and I have been married for 30 years, raised two boys who have turned out exceptional men. One is has been in the army now for 5 years, career soldier and my other son is married with a 2 year old and works in the mining industry. 

My wife has always been the light of my life and I have always thought how lucky I was to marry her. I have never cheated on her, have not even come close. She was the love of my life, a sweet caring woman who always helped others and I thought we had the marriage people aspire to. 

I am now 55, but I am fit and healthy, my wife and I have never had problems sexually and I thought she was as happy as I was with our relationship.

My wife is now 54, she has always been a beautiful woman, and still is, even though she complains that her body has changed over the years. I always tell her that she is still the most desirable woman I have ever met and will be until the day I die.

12 months ago, my MIL took ill, dementia. My wife and I both work and she goes to the hospital every afternoon to see her mother. If she is away I always cook dinner and clean the house up before she comes home.

Typically she would would get home around 7pm, kiss me hello and we would have dinner and talk about our day.

My wife, at times, would go to her mothers house and keep it clean while she was in hospital, about once a week to keep it clean and tidy.

3 weeks ago I got home from work, put dinner in the oven and noticed my wife left a package on the bench for her mother which I knew she had been waiting on. I thought, well the dinner is on, I will pop over to her mothers house and leave it for her while she was visiting her mother.

MIL house is about 10 minutes away from our home.

I drove over there and pulled into the driveway, my wife's car was already there and another parked behind it.

I went through the front door and called for her.

I then heard noises coming down the hallway so I went down to see what was going on. I opened the door to my MIL spare bedroom. What I saw broke my heart. I saw a guy putting on his pants and my wife trying to get dressed as well. They both stopped and just stared at me.

I could see the panic in their eyes. My mind just went numb. All I could say as I looked at my wife, was What the fuck Deb, why??. 

The guy ran passed me and I heard him leave as I just stared at my wife. she just stood there with tears in her eyes, she finally said I was never to find out, she was sorry, she didn't know what to say. 

She started to cry and asked me not to leave her, we need to talk about this, it will never happen again, it was only the first time, she didn't know what she was doing. she will do anything to fix her mistake. 

I just turned around and left. My head was exploding, my heart was breaking, I felt like someone had died, because something had died.

I got into my car and just drove. I started to get calls from her, so I turned my phone off.

While driving all I could think about is what did I do wrong, why would she destroy our marriage, how long have I been made a fool of. The thoughts of us making love after she had been with her lover, it just disgusted me . My perfect wife and marriage had died in front of me. How quick can love turn into loathing. 

I found myself about 3 hours away from home, I couldn't go back. I couldn't trust myself not to do something that would hurt the rest of my family.  I just pulled up to a rest area and stayed there until morning, no sleep, just sitting there with all these horrible thoughts going through my mind. 

I turned my phone back on, many missed calls from her and texts, I didn't read them but sent a text that I was on my way home and she had better not be there, I told her to go stay at her mothers house. If she was at home then I would leave and promised she would never see me again. I turned off my phone again.

I got home and she had left.

My son came around in the afternoon and found me drunk and blubbering in my chair, he put me to bed and stayed with me until the next morning. 

He had a coffee waiting for me and said his mom had spoken to him and asked for him to check on me.

His mother had already told him what had happened and she was deeply ashamed. We both cried over the coffee as we were realising nothing will ever be the same again. When my head had cleared I was angry  and devastated, in my mind my marriage was already over, my wife had destroyed it. I didn't even care why she did it, the point was she had completely annihilated our family. 

My son kept me up to date on his mother over the next week while I processed what I saw. I told him to tell her to come over and have the talk. 

She did.

This is already to long, I will break up what happened next later. ",1,1742533529.0,u_ThrowRA-neverthought,0,1.0,False

1jg8wcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jg8wcs,The one espresso you have to try in Tokyo as a coffee lover,"I'll start by saying I consider myself a heavy coffee drinker. I start most days off with a homemade pourover and at this point I've tried coffee & espresso around the world, from straight espresso pours in Parisian and Italian cafes to turkish coffee prepared streetside in Istanbul to farm-to-cafe pourovers in Columbia.

That being said, there's one espresso shot that clearly stands above the rest, and by a comfortable margin too. If there's one coffee shop you have to try in Tokyo, it's Glitch Coffee in Ginza.

They source premium coffee from around the world and roast their own beans which you would expect from this type of cafe, but there's something about how they pull their espresso that is just so unique, it's an impossible task to put to words. Glitch's espresso tasting notes aren't just hints of citrus, it tastes like they packed a whole grapefruit into your espresso cup. The beans from china which have ""notes of tea"" taste like they've been steeped in an oolong teapot for a week before it reaches your cup. It's impossible to undersell how unique & present the espresso at Glitch Coffee is.

Just FYI, you're going to spend a lot. Like 2000 yen for an espresso a lot. You'll also potentially have to line up outside for over an hour, I know I did my first visit. But when you do and you finally receive your drink, you'll be thankful you did.

I can also recommend their espresso martinis which are made with Japanese vodka and gin. Tbh I wasn't impressed with their pourover but that's just me.

I've applied food grade silicone lubricant on the shaft before putting it back, but now it won't spin on its own when there's no beans.

I do have other forms of grease, and I'm even considering using things like Krytox (yes, the mechanical keyboard ones), but I'd rather err on the side of caution when it comes to food.

So my questions are:

* Do I need to use food-grade grease on the shaft instead?
* Is it more likely that there's contaminants (e.g. coffee particles in the shaft)?
* Has anyone used non-food grade grease with success?

Update: I've decided to use Molykote 111 on the shaft. Fun fact, this Molykote was back from when I bought my Cafelat Robot! No more issues, grinder works like a charm now.",1,1742531629.0,1zpresso,0,1.0,False

Rice crispy breaded tilapia encrusted with Italian herbal seasoning, tumeric, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, dandelion tea and lemon/ginger tea

Baked scallops baked in butter, orange peel, and many of the same seasonings as the tilapia except with the addition of a ramen seasoning I have which includes poppy seeds and more with some rice crispy breadcrumbs

Green beans with some garlic powder, black pepper, minced onion flakes, butter

Some homade iced coffee with French vanilla creamer and Columbian coffee grounds

And sea salt water to purify the space. 

My wife and I follow the practice of waiting some time then eating the meal afterwards, as we don't have anywhere to safely dispose of the food in terms of local wildlife, we believe throwing away is a form of disrespect, and it reduces our food waste which helps financially (plus we believe they take the spiritual aspect of it and leave the physical aspect). That being said, we always wait a few minutes after we finish our own before saying thank you and sharing the offering. It always tastes way better like they add their own ingredients or freshness to it. My wife and I can taste the difference, and we agree that's how we know they accepted the offering :3 

We've also given orange slices to each of our Patron deities' shrines, an orange peel to our guinea pig, and the eggs used to bread the fish to our dog + one extra whole egg (he loves working out how to get the egg out plus the shell is good for him). 

Hope you enjoyed! I think this is my first official post on this subreddit. I'm a long term pagan but a new Hellenistic one. My journey has been an interesting one, that I may post later.
