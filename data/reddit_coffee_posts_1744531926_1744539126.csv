1jy4bw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiKitchenGear/comments/1jy4bw5/essential_kitchen_appliances_for_indian_homes/,Essential Kitchen Appliances for Indian Homes,"If you're setting up a kitchen for the first time‚Äîwhether it's in a new home, rental, or just upgrading from basic cookware‚Äîthis list will help you focus on what actually makes cooking easier in an Indian kitchen. Here's a practical starter pack based on what *actually gets used daily*.

# 1. Mixer Grinder

*Can‚Äôt do without this in any Indian home.*

This is the workhorse for chutneys, dry masalas, smoothies, and even dosa/idli batter.

**In my experience**, getting a 750W motor is worth it‚Äîless chance of overload or burnt smells. A good set includes 3 jars: one each for dry grinding, wet grinding, and chutneys.

**I typically recommend:**

* **Sujata Dynamix** (built like a tank, lasts for years)
* **Preethi Zodiac** (versatile, but slightly bulky)
* **Philips HL7707** (good all-rounder with food processor attachments)

# 2. Pressure Cooker

*Still the fastest way to cook dals, rice, khichdi, rajma‚Äîyou name it.*

**Personally**, I prefer stovetop cookers because they‚Äôre faster and more predictable once you get the hang of the whistles. But electric options like Geek Robocook are great if you want to avoid gas or prefer ‚Äúset-and-forget‚Äù cooking.

**For beginners:**

* **Hawkins 3L** is great for everyday use
* **Prestige 5L** works better if you cook for 3+ people
* For electric: **Geek Robocook or Instant Pot** (a bit pricey but super convenient)

# 3. Induction Cooktop (or Gas Stove)

If you don't have gas or want a backup during LPG refills, an induction cooktop is a great addition.

**From personal use**, Philips induction models are super reliable. I‚Äôve also used Prestige ones‚Äîthey work fine, but Philips feels sturdier over time.

Go for:

* **Philips Viva** or **Prestige PIC series**
* Make sure your cookware is induction-compatible

# 4. Electric Kettle

*Underrated but incredibly useful.*

**In my experience**, this saves so much time‚Äîboiling water for chai, Maggi, oats, or just pre-heating water for faster cooking. It‚Äôs especially useful in hostels or rentals.

Good options:

* Budget: **Pigeon** or **Butterfly**
* Mid-range: **Kent** or **Philips** (auto shut-off is a must)

# 5. Toaster or Sandwich Maker

Optional, but great for quick breakfasts or snack-time.

**I typically recommend** a simple grill sandwich maker if you like toasties or need a break from poha and upma. Works great with leftover sabzi too.

* Try **Borosil Super Jumbo** (if you like grilled sandwiches)
* **Prestige or Bajaj** for basic pop-up toasters

# 6. Hand Blender or Small Bullet Blender

Useful for pureeing cooked veggies, making small chutneys, or blending dal.

**In my experience**, hand blenders save you the hassle of using and cleaning the full-size mixer for small jobs.

* Hand blender: **Orpat HHB-100E** or **Prestige**
* Bullet-style blender: **Borosil Nutrifresh** or **NutriBullet**

# 7. Fridge (of course)

Even a small 180L single-door fridge works fine for 1‚Äì2 people.

**I usually suggest** going for a frost-free model if budget allows‚Äîit saves time and hassle long term.

# What You Don‚Äôt Need Right Away

Unless you have specific needs or a big family, you can skip these in the beginning:

* OTG or convection oven
* Air fryer
* Wet grinder (unless you make batter often)
* Food processor
* Coffee machine

# Final Tips

* **Buy slow.** Use your kitchen for a few weeks‚Äîsee what you *actually* miss.
* **Check for noise.** Some mixer grinders are *really* loud.
* **Service matters.** Stick to brands with good after-sales support in your city.

1jy49ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jy49ws/the_moment_i_lost_faith_in_academia/,The Moment I Lost Faith in Academia,"Confession/vent time; throwaway account.

I've got pretty big secret from my time in academia that I feel I have to tell, even if it's only to strangers on Reddit. The secret or drama mostly just involves me acting as a proxy or observer for what happened between three colleagues (my old MA supervisor, PhD supervisor and my (former) PhD colleague who had the same PhD supervisor as me).

The relationship between my old MA supervisor and PhD supervisor can best be described as a mentor-prot√©g√© relationship, but also friends at the same time. The former is a respected and internationally recognised professor in the field, the latter an up-and-coming, ambitious researcher at the time.

I had a good relationship with both people. I should probably mention that my colleague had our PhD supervisor as supervisor for both the bachelor's degree and the MA.

About a year and a half into my programme, my colleague and office mate had finished and was about to defend. My old supervisor had been asked to be the internal examiner from our university. The day came and I played host to my old supervisor on campus before the defence was due to take place. We set up a spot outside with a cup of coffee and I just thought they would have an informal, light conversation. Quite early on in the conversation, they asked me the very pointed question of whether I felt I was getting enough supervision during the PhD programme. I had to think a bit - which is probably not a good sign - to realise that I probably didn't.

They frowned, inhaled and paused for a moment. And then they drop a colossal bombshell. My colleague's thesis is terrible. So poor, trite and derivative that it should be dismissed outright, with no possibility of revision. I could elaborate on exactly what's wrong with the substance of it, but that's not really the main point here.

According to them, it is immensely bad, BUT they are going to let it go through, unless my colleague catastrophically messes up during the defence (they didn't).

The two external examiners flew in from abroad and are obviously not exactly what you would call harsh critics. I think they were more worried about stepping on toes, making unfavourable impressions or violating perceived university norms/traditions by really subjecting it to critical scrutiny.

But my old thesis supervisor has no such reservations. They're usually pretty blunt when they have a strong opinion about something academic, and even a little too much so sometimes. Of course, it's the relationship with my current supervisor that complicated the whole thing. To cut a long story short, my thesis supervisor did not want to outright fail one of my PhD supervisor's fellows, simply because it would be a scandal for the prot√©g√© (and the university department) and act as a serious stumbling block for career advancement, since in most cases it is quite unheard of for a supervisor in good conscience to let their student hand in their thesis if it is so deficient.

There is more than just cynical careerism and the protection of someone who can champion and carry on one's academic legacy in consideration here, although there is certainly that too. As I said, they were also close friends.

My colleague and I were my PhD supervisor's first PhD fellows under their tutelage. In this way, my old thesis supervisor was also in the process of informing me that my current supervisor, their protege, was a poor and irresponsible advisor to us. I hadn't really thought about it that way before, but I quickly realised that they had actually helped me very little and only quite superficially in the time I had been a PhD so far. When you're trying something for the first time you don't always know how good or bad your circumstances and framework are or what the standard is. Very little text review and follow-up on their part. Few concrete expectations and almost no requirements for something that had to be delivered before a specific deadline. Laissez-faire approach in the extreme you might call it.

Anyway, my old supervisor secretly offered to act as my shadow supervisor. I accepted as my mind swirled with thoughts of my colleague who was about to go through their farce of a defence. I was completely speechless and dumbfounded. The day passed and the defence was completed. We (close PhD colleagues, supervisor and assessment committee, including old supervisor) were invited out to dinner with my PhD colleague. My colleague was happy and relieved that evening, but it was not a very pleasant experience for me, to say the least.

Of course, my colleague is the actual victim here. This person did not receive proper guidance and assistance along the way and was completely gaslit into believing that what they wrote was a creditable, reputable piece of research, even as my old supervisor had confronted the PhD supervisor behind closed doors with the gravity of the matter and explained to him how shoddy they thought it was. In the end, I don't think our PhD supervisor actually cared that much that we did well. My (former) colleague is now walking around the world with a degree they probably shouldn't have because my old supervisor made an emotionally charged decision.

Years later, I'm still mad at them both. My old supervisor, because he let me in on the muddy business and secret. He could have found a way to offer to help without telling me. I'm also disappointed that he then didn't have the integrity to treat the assessment of the thesis with the objectivity it should have been given.

I had real resentment towards my PhD supervisor deep down, but treated him with the normal friendly and sociable approach on the surface. This person never realised that I knew all this about my old colleague during my programme. I know I worked incredibly hard independently to produce a good, cogent thesis (shadow supervisor was not overly active but still far more engaged than official supervisor), but even as I received high praise in the assessment for the size of my bibliography and other stuff, PhD supervisor had the fucking gall to insist that they wouldn't have done their job properly had the bibliography been anything but stellar, suggesting they did diddly squat to enhance it or ensure its quality (they really didn't, and I would be surprised if they even had the slightest inkling of what works were referenced in it). My frustration at what this person has gotten away with in this case has not completely disappeared and probably never will. This person is now a professor, and I am one of the few people who knows that this individual is a hack and a shallow researcher who cares more about reputation and networking than doing real in-depth and innovative research.

The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I left academia after my defence. I was very happy with my own defence and the assessment. The relationship between my old supervisor and PhD supervisor soured dramatically and during the last year of my PhD there was palpable tension between them. Old supervisor wanted less and less to do with PhD supervisor, and disengaged from some of their work-related commitments between them.

I can never tell this to people in my network, let alone old university friends. But I need to tell someone, so here I am.

Maybe that's partially why my old supervisor told me in the first place - to unburden. But he was also justifiably concerned but should have gone about it differently.

I'm currently planning on putting together an ultra-low-budget Hackintosh and need your assistance. My goal is to buy a used CPU + motherboard combo within a very tight budget ‚Äî around $50 maximum. I already have an RX 6800XT graphics card ready, as well as some spare DDR4 memory, so integrated graphics compatibility does not matter at all.

**Main Requirements:**

* **Performance:**¬†CPU performance at least equivalent to Intel Core i5-8350U (a quad-core, 8-thread laptop CPU). I believe this performance level roughly corresponds to desktop processors like an 8th-gen Intel i3 (Coffee Lake) or a Ryzen 5 second-generation CPU (Zen+, e.g., Ryzen 5 2600X) or above.
* **DDR4 Platform Only:**¬†As mentioned, I already have DDR4 memory sticks available and need them compatible.
* **Avoiding Platforms:**¬†I'd like to avoid X79/X99 platforms due to stability and driver compatibility concerns on Hackintosh setups.

Given my very limited $50 budget, I understand that it may be a challenge and I may have to look at older-generation hardware or less-popular combos. Could anyone please suggest realistic second-hand motherboard + CPU combinations within this price range that will fulfill my budget, Hackintosh compatibility, and performance expectations? Or, if my budget is unrealistic, please let me know if I should reconsider.

I would also like to hear your thoughts and feedback.


Here‚Äôs my concern: I see soooo many posts blaming Introversion for their difficulties, when we all really know it‚Äôs Anxiety. I know, I know. This sounds like a broken record at this point. This sentiment has gotten posted and commented often. It sounds like I‚Äôm invalidating your experience by saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not Introversion.‚Äù However‚Ä¶let me reframe this.


What is so bad at accepting that this is Anxiety, and not Introversion? Is it the diagnosis that scares you? A diagnosis is power and power is knowledge. Once you have a diagnosis, you have access to tools, community, medication. Imagine a life without anxiety. That *is* actually possible for you! But you can‚Äôt get there if you refuse to name what you are facing as Anxiety.


Here‚Äôs how an employee may thrive as an Introvert but suffer with Anxiety in an office environment:


An introvert will confidently driving into their parking space, park, step out of their car, and take a moment to acknowledge the beauty of the morning sun and birds. They will walk into their building, and walk into the break room with confidence and a gentle smile. They will pour themselves their coffee, and genuinely smile to those who walk by. Then they will walk to their desk, sit in their chair, and take a moment to sip on their coffee and enjoy the silence before diving into the hustle and bustle of the day. As coworkers call, email, and pop into their cubicle‚Äî they are concise and pleasant. They get straight to the point, but are kind and courteous. Others enjoy working on projects with them because they are clear communicators who don‚Äôt waste time and are there to work. Although working with others isn‚Äôt your favorite, you understand it‚Äôs a necessary part of the job. You save the second half of your day for your individual assignments so you can recharge and wind down for the day.


Meanwhile, an employee with Anxiety will have to slam on their brakes to dodge a squirrel as they drive into work because they are replaying possible ways to respond to the ‚Äúgood morning‚Äùs in the break room that they are dreading. They will park and then wait in their car for as long as they can without being late, holding onto their precious alone time for as long as possible. When they absolutely have to, they will exit their car with dread. By the time they walk into the building and into the break room, they have built up and repeated all possible scenarios so many times that now any remark made by anyone is annoying and an unpleasant inconvenience. They quickly pour their coffee, but spill some on their shirt because they are in a hurry and in their head so much. Then they start shaking. They assume everyone must be thinking how weird they are being (in reality, no one has even noticed anything being off or odd). They quickly scurry into their cubicle, dreading the moment anyone tries to call, email, or pop into their cubicle to collaborate. The thought of working with other people plagues and exhausts them for the entire day. Even if they manage to dodge all emails and phone calls and hide from any interaction, they are still completely exhausted from the mere thought and possibility of having to socialize with others. They go home feeling unfulfilled, completely exhausted, and often times chronically fatigued or ill due to prolonged untreated anxiety.


Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî INTROVERSION IS BEAUTIFUL. WE ARE SO FREAKIN‚Äô LUCKY.


Extroverts will not feel fulfilled or energized unless they have been around other people. Meanwhile, we only need ourselves (and nature, animals)! THAT IS A SUPERPOWER, Y‚ÄôALL. The ability to get lost in a sunrise?? To get lost in a book?? To write a riveting fantastical, rich story?? To enjoy an evening at home, alone, with some calming jazz music playing, sipping on your beverage of choice, while slow cooking some stew and baking some cinnamon rolls. Getting in your comfiest of comfy clothes, under piles and piles of blankets and pillows, making hot chocolate and popcorn, a binging brain-rot comfort tv. Going solo camping or camping with your dog. Meditating! Creating art!! Taking a day nap!! Sitting in a hammock during a beautiful, breezy spring day and listening to the birds sing.

Hybrid 

Morning strain for pain relief and IBS stomach related issues 

Another strain that's got hardly any reviews or pictures but a few mixed or negative comments so here's my first impression..

On opening the bag I'm not met with much of a smell but I am still bunged up still.
I received this yesterday so i put it in a glass jar with a boveda and thought I'd wait until this morning to give it a fair shout. 
It does smell better today, kind of a creamy floral scent, similar to creamy kees only sweeter. 

The size of the buds are all smalls unfortunately but they are well trimmed and has a good trichome covering and the buds feel fresh, not overly dry at all. For the price they look good, just smalls. They also have a long expiry d√†te.

The taste is there it's a little muted like the smell but I'm getting the floral taste that I can smell with a hint of creaminess. No cookie genetics coming through for me. It's hard to describe the taste but it's alright. I think it'll improve with a boveda.

The effects are not bad at all. I'm using this as a first thing in the morning strain with my coffee,

For pain relief it's taken the edge off, and made me feel relaxed but not couch locked and quite uplifted mentally. It's helped with my appetite making me feel hungry and ready to eat.
It has more of a body feeling with a slight behind the eyes effect, again a slight old school feel to it.
The downside it's quite short lived, maybe an hour or so after I was thinking about another vape. I did only have 0.2g with my arizer extreme Q 4 and the bag. 
After seeing a really negative comment about this strain I was worried about what I was going to receive, in all honesty I have no idea what they were talking about. 
For ¬£5.50 it's alright so far, on par with creamy kees possibly better?  certainly better than vanilla ice.
I'll update in a few days my final thoughts, again so far so good.ü§úüíö",1,1744537662.0,mcukmedicalcannabis,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve (28F) been dating my boyfriend (31M) for a while now. He runs his own business and has always been upfront about his demanding work schedule. I run my own business too, so I get it‚Äîlife can be hectic. Still, we try to carve out time for each other, like quick coffee runs during the day, and I appreciate that effort.

But here‚Äôs where it gets confusing: he talks about marrying me, even wants to take my parents out for dinner to talk to them officially. Yet, when we‚Äôre together, there‚Äôs barely any emotional or physical affection. He rarely expresses how he feels‚Äîno compliments, no ‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù no ‚Äúyou look beautiful.‚Äù It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ silent in that department.

A recent example: we spent the night at my place‚Äîwatched a movie, had dinner, I even gave him a head and a shoulder massage. But throughout the evening, there wasn‚Äôt a single kiss, no hand-holding, no cuddling. It felt platonic. Then we went to bed, and he did cuddle me while we slept, but that's the extent of it.

Another time, he traveled to a different city and brought back a local delicacy just for me, which was sweet and thoughtful. Recently, he sent a box of mangoes for me and my family. So it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt care at all. It‚Äôs just that his way of showing it feels so subtle and inconsistent that I end up second-guessing everything. I keep questioning, if he even finds me attractive? Am I not attractive enough for him? Or am I just a safe option for him?

Am I overthinking this? Is this just his love language being different from mine? Or am I ignoring red flags? Any advice would really help. I just want to understand what‚Äôs going on here.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:
Boyfriend talks about marriage but rarely shows affection. His actions feel caring sometimes, but overall I‚Äôm confused by the mixed signals. Not sure if it‚Äôs love language differences or red flags.

Lately i've had to move departments to keep my hours as is, didnt want to but it is what it is. I also had most of march off using up holidays so i wasnt on that department for about 3 weeks. Walked into a lets talk about being too ""slow"", which is a new one. Trouble is ""my name came up"" from other staff as being too slow. When asked what i've done and what i can do to improve the manager didnt actually know. He hadn't seen it. 

The staff on this new department are all very cliquey, i've heard them during my morning coffee break slagging off members of staff not in thier circle for years at this point. So i actually mentioned to others before the move, that THATS the glaring issue and i wouldnt be surprised if thier crosshairs ended up pointed at me eventually. 

These people gang up and mass report people they dont like, and management arent investigating it and just taking thier word from the looks of it. Its why i feel theres going to be more, and more, and more because i've seen them not stop with numerous people over the years. 

Any advice on how to nip this in the bud? I was going to wait until my second talk, because if i'm working well its going to be insanely easy to poke holes in. Once is a coincidence, twice is a pattern sort of thing. Do i go to the store manager? HR?

1jy3yto,https://www.reddit.com/r/PwC/comments/1jy3yto/20yo_stuck_in_brain_dead_role_need_help_with/,"20yo stuck in brain dead role, need help with internal transfers","Hey guys,
I'm a 20-year-old Commerce graduate, currently working in a Big 4 in India. I‚Äôve been with the Forensics team under Risk Consulting for 6 months now. Let me explain what my role involves so you get a sense of where I‚Äôm coming from. My team mainly assists clients‚Äîmostly private equity investors‚Äîwith due diligence checks.

As a Specialist (which is the entry-level role), my work starts with receiving the names of target individuals or entities. I search for them across public databases, government sites, and social media, and take screenshots of every search‚Äîregardless of whether I find anything. If there are any hits, I check if they relate to my target, gather supporting info, and write it up in a report. If nothing comes up, I still have to document and back it up. The report itself is pretty basic‚Äîjust a summary of what the target does, contact details, public domain results, and a short conclusion. The process is super repetitive: fixed list of databases, same search steps, and then writing summaries, often with help from ChatGPT. After that, the report goes to an Associate who reviews it and gets back to me with corrections.

The problem is‚Äîthere‚Äôs absolutely no consulting here. I‚Äôm not learning anything new, there‚Äôs no data analysis, no client interaction, and no real challenge. It‚Äôs brain-dead work. On top of that, the deadlines are intense, and I occasionally breach them because I‚Äôm often pulled into other backend work. My People Manager is chill and doesn‚Äôt nag, but there‚Äôs another Manager who constantly ropes me into Salesforce tasks and client onboarding activities. These tasks are ideally meant for Project Managers, not juniors. I don‚Äôt get chargeable hours for them, and it pushes my actual work behind. Plus, this admin work doesn‚Äôt add much value to my career, aside from saying I‚Äôm familiar with Salesforce.

The team has 40+ people spread across locations. At my office, we have one MD, six Senior Managers/Managers, two Associates, and three Specialists. It‚Äôs a male-dominated team and I‚Äôm the only female junior here. I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of misogynistic comments from a peer, but I didn‚Äôt report it because the team seems to like him more and this fucker is 2 faced asf. He acts polite around the team and shows a completely different side when alone with me, which makes it harder to speak up.

There was another incident where a Senior Manager assigned a task to a Senior Associate, who then dumped it on me after hours without any context. I hadn‚Äôt done that task before and hadn‚Äôt been trained, so I took over an hour to finish it. The next day, the SM pulled me aside and was upset because it had been an urgent client task, and apparently this task would've taken her only 10 minutes but I caused a delay. Later, I overheard her badmouthing me to another Manager, mocking how long I took and how I always stay late in office (which I do just to avoid the crowd and heat). Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that Manager giving me more of the admin and Salesforce work‚Äînone of which the male juniors are asked to do. It‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm being seen as some clueless bimbo. The male juniors get greeted in the mornings, share laughs with seniors, go for coffee, and get high-fives, while I don‚Äôt even get a basic ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù unless there‚Äôs some extra work to be done.

There‚Äôs another vertical in my team that handles Level 2 work‚Äîwhere they reach out to market sources via calls (under false pretexts) to collect information. This work is considered high value and gets the most attention from clients. I thought of doing L2 work to gain more visibility so to learn L2, I volunteered to help with transcripts for these calls. But after listening in, I realized how ethically grey it was, and I don‚Äôt want to compromise on my values for the sake of client deliverables. Unfortunately, now that I‚Äôve started, the Level 2 team keeps pushing me to take up more of their transcripts. Again‚Äîno chargeable hours for this either. And I've not gained any visibility unless it's to give me more work. 

I even reached out to my People Manager and asked if I could be part of more client meetings. He let me attend one and then never again. I‚Äôve also been asking him for a 1-on-1 feedback session for over a month. I reminded him twice, but didn‚Äôt want to keep nagging him. When I reminded him again last week, he said we‚Äôd talk for sure‚Äîbut then left office on Friday without speaking to me. I was planning to use that meeting to bring up all these issues and to ask if I could explore other teams within the Line of Service. I feel like I‚Äôm not learning anything meaningful and my work has become painfully mundane.

I don‚Äôt have a strong relationship with my PM, and I haven‚Äôt pushed harder because of the sexist comments I‚Äôve received from that peer about me and my PM. On top of that, the managers have their own cliques and are often gossiping about each other. Honestly, the whole team feels toxic at this point and I want out.

When I joined as a trainee, we were told during onboarding that we‚Äôre allowed to explore different teams based on our interests. I really want to do that now‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I‚Äôm interested in finance, management consulting, India markets, PE strategy, or even the government sector teams. I‚Äôd love to work in any of those, but I‚Äôm worried I might not have the right skill set. I‚Äôm also scared of ending up in a team that‚Äôs even worse than my current one.

How can I request a transfer without causing bad blood? I know people will judge me regardless, but I‚Äôd rather work somewhere I can grow. Also, are there other SBUs within the firm where the work is less brain-dead and more strategic? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to make the most of this experience without feeling exploited and invisible.

1jy3vrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1jy3vrv/bladder_problems_from_anorexia/,Bladder Problems from Anorexia,"Hi All, 

I‚Äôve noticed some recent posts and comments asking about what to do about bladder problems due to anorexia. Maybe this will help some and guide you to answers, and also may be a cautionary tale of the consequences of anorexia. 

I am not a medical provider and NOT giving medical advice. I‚Äôm sharing what has helped me and the diagnosis from a urologist I finally received after years of bladder pain and burning, urinating unintentionally, and urination frequency. 

I too have experienced severe bladder problems due to (what my urologist is assuming and could be an interplay of other chronic health conditions) chronic malnutrition. I was finally diagnosed with interstitial cystitis of the bladder (use to be called painful bladder syndrome). AGAIN this my diagnosis and not intended to diagnose others here. 

I am going to try to simplify what I‚Äôve learned throughout the years of what occurs in the bladder when we do not eat or drink enough fluids. Feel free to chime in if others would like to add their experiences. 

This condition occurs when the bladder wall lining genetically changes to ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù when there is too much acidity in the urine. This is a VERY simple explanation. Of course, it‚Äôs more scientifically and medically complex on the processes that occur overtime with this condition. 

Again very simplified explanation from what I‚Äôve learned: So when we are chronically malnourished and/or dehydrated, the acidity in your body builds. Think about the acid in your stomach, blood, in your intestines, kidneys, and your bladder, etc. It‚Äôs like a pressure cooker of liquid acid and your bladder is one of the final exits. When working normally, the ‚Äúfood and water liquid‚Äù coat the bladder‚Äôs wall to save it from the acid but when we do not eat or drink consistently the wall is exposed to this raw acid. Do this for years and it ruins the bladder‚Äôs wall and now reacts to anything acidic you eat or drink to decrease further damage to your bladder wall lining. Basically the bladder wall is damaged and has genetically modified its cells to protect and repair the wall that remains by inflaming its cells which cause the pain. 

Rightfully so our bladders are traumatized and when it feels whatever is in your bladder is too acidic it has ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù and makes you want to urinate frequently and causes pain because of the inflammation inside the bladder wall lining trying to protect itself. 

Again, this is a VERY simplified explanation. 

After years of bladder hydrodistentions, other very painful bladder procedures that I don‚Äôt want to scare others with, and numerous tests this is what has helped ME. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve learned from medical providers, research, and subreddits on this condition that everyone‚Äôs bladder is different and responds differently to treatments. What helped me may not help you but at least guide you on finding some relief for this very painful condition while you find relief. 

Here is what I have found to help:

1.) hydration with water is imperative. It sounds counterintuitive since you already have urination frequency. Your instinct tells you to stop drinking water so much. No- you need to flush the acidity out of your bladder system and repair your bladder walls. Of course eating helps too but if still actively recovering, try to focus on hydration. 

2.) work with a dietician or nutritionist to determine which foods are too acidic for your bladder. Unfortunately, this is trial and error. There are lists you can google for IC foods but everyone is different and you will find countless different stories of what foods triggered people and what didn‚Äôt. For example, I‚Äôm okay with coffee and soda but others are in the ER in pain if they drink this. Others are okay with lemonade but I take one sip of lemonade and I‚Äôll be in the ER that night asking the universe for forgiveness and IV pain medicine. 

3.) I will not name the supplements since it is against the rules but there are over the counter supplements to use OCCASIONALLY to lower the acid in your stomach before you eat or drink something acidic. I made the mistake of taking this everyday and ended up with kidney stones and passing them without knowing! This is how painful this condition can be. I was in so much bladder pain I did not know I was passing a kidney stone. Ask your doctor about this and if it is safe and if so, take this before you intentionally eat something that you know will cause your bladder to react. Again a lot of trial and error and flushing your bladder by drinking a lot of water. Again, hydration is key when taking these supplements. 

4.) see a urologist if able. There is prescription medication for this and will help with the urgency, pain, and burning. 

5.) also make sure it is not a UTI. It‚Äôs so hard to determine whether you have a flare up or it‚Äôs a true UTI. Better to be tested than end up septic. 

6.) Amazon sells acidity strips you can pee on to see how acidic your urine is. This helps me to determine if I am drinking enough water. Even if it shows up acidic and I may not be in pain that day, I know if I don‚Äôt keep up with my water intake I may get a flare up later that day or week. This has helped me gauge how acidic my body fluid is.  

7.) For pain without the use of prescription medication I use: heating pads, the over the counter pills that turn your urine yellow (make sure you are medically okay to take this because it can cause kidney damage if you overuse them), physical therapy for my bladder and pelvic floor because they are connected, tens units, and stress management (high cortisol affects the acidity in your body). * I suggest not drinking or pill form anything cranberry! All IC suffers I‚Äôve encountered universally agree that it actually aggravates the bladder. 

Honestly, if you can- I know in the US healthcare is a privilege unfortunately, see a urologist. I wish I had known sooner. Would have saved me years of antibiotics I did not need and now have immunity to ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

I‚Äôve had this since the start of my ED and wish someone would have said ‚Äúhey, eat and drink because your bladder is going to shrivel up and you will end up in daily pain and wearing daily incontinence pads starting in your 20s because you cannot hold your urine when you jump, run, cough, laugh and sneeze‚Äù. 

Maybe take this as motivation to recover too. If anything practice harm reduction and drink plenty of water. This helped me in my early days of recovery. Just having water in me freaked me out but I knew my bladder needed it. Having the acidity strips helped in the early days to know how much water my body needed. After a while I became in tune with my body and now I just know when I‚Äôm dehydrated and when I‚Äôm hydrated. 

I hope this helps at least one person. I‚Äôm open to questions anyone may have.",2,1744536683.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

I just want to share my story about this girl.

To give you guys context, i met her after my ex girlfriend broke up wirh me. 

I cheated on my ex girlfriend of 2 years and I wanted to change myself for the better. 

I drowned myself in liquor for a month straight trying to tell myself that I can no longer change the past and what's done is done. 

Me and my ex broke up on the first week of December. 

I was trying to win her back for almost a month and instead of making things right and getting back together we ended up hurting each other. 

There was this one night that everything fell apart. I was trying to grab her phone, my ex was crying all night. I was so drunk at the time and I ended up physically hurting her. 

She doesn't deserve me, yeah I know that for a fact. 

I distanced myself from her and her family. 

I blocked her on all social media websites. 

I stopped texting or messaging here on sms. 

I completely drowned myself in liquor and made myself busy at work. 
..... 

1 month after the breakup, i quit drinking. This was in February na. 

......

I was still focusing on keeping myself busy and started working out at home. 
... 

I built myself to the point where it no longer hurts when I hear her name. I no longer think about my ex and I go on with my life. 

...

Second week of February, i had a colleague introduce me to this girl who said that she was looking for someone to talk to. 

...

I thought about it but I wasn't really ready for a relationship at the time..

...
I tossed a coin knowing that the odds would be 50-50 kung sakaling magkaron man kame ng connection ng inintroduce sakin nung friend ko. 

...

We talked for a while and we enjoyed each other's company despite her being 5 hours away from me. 

...

Jump to February 14, 2025.
 
I went my way to actually meet her. 
...

At first I was anxious about it kase, what if mapangitan siya sakin. Or di niya magustuhan yung vibe ko.

Really nervous now.
...

She arrived sa meeting place and I was so surprised na nakamotor siya.
... 
Time finally came and we met at a coffee shop. 
..

She was wearing an all pink outfit. 

Pink shoes, pink skirt, and a pink bag. 

Surprisingly, her aura seems approachable and I don't know what to feel but she seemed very approachable. 
...

We talked for a bit and decided to go elsewhere.

.. she took me to a place where its close to a lake or something. 

... there was an acoustic bank playing and there were a lot of people. 

...we wanted to grab something to eat but all the seats were full and the empty place to sit was at the bar. 

... instead of eating a full blast dinner , we came to a decision to drink some liquor. A tower to be precise as I wanted to know if she really drinks a lot. 

. We talked a lot and she was very fun to be with. 
Nakwento nya about her past experiences with exes. Her friends and how she is as a person. 

Her opinions on some topics were a bit dry but I always found a way to make a comeback para ma save yung conversation.

We ordered some quesadilla and nachos to pair in with the liquor. 

Everything else from the concersations are blurry to me as I tend to forget words that don't matter much. 

After the tower she took me to a place where we could take pictures of us together sa second floor overlooking the lake.

We talked there and to my surprise she held my hand. 

I leaned in closer but I only kissed her neck. Fudge. Was I wrong to do that on the first date.

Anyways. We went down and she took even more pictures. 

... i knew the night was ending but she asked if we could go to another coffee shop to sober up. 

... we went back to the parking lot where she parked her motorcycle and funny thing was, she couldn't find her motorcycle. 


.. when she finally found it, i discovered that she recently got into an accident with the guy na nagreto sakanya saken. 

Sketchy right. 

Brushed it off for now. 

We drove to a coffee shop like 3-4 kilometers away from the coffee shop. 

We sobered up dun and she was telling me about a story na her mother just recently passed away. 

It was a sad moment and I asked a lot of questions. 

She was mostly cool with everything. 

The night was ending. We finished out coffee. Hinatid niya ako sa Airbnb where I was renting back then and to me , everything went well even if nothing else went down .

..

We spent the rest of the night apart and she went home. ..

During my stay aa Airbnb, i spent the rest of my morning eith the kilig of the first night I saw her. How she brushed her hair , how she smiled, her uncontrollable laughter and everything..

...

She thought I was a playboy and indeed at the time I was. 

... 

Nung kinahapunan na . Nag aya siya ulit na mag kape. 

Nagkita ulit kame sa place kung san kame unang nagkita. 

She ordered a latte and I didn't order anything as I just ate. 

.... hinatid niya ako and I ended up riding the van and then a bus back to san fernando, La union where I worked.


... fast forward to february 26, i accidentally recorded her calling me ""babe"" for the first time. 

For me it was a milestone as I thought that made everything official. 
...

March came and kn the first of March I decided to see her again.. 

This time she booked me an Airbnb and we met there. I was so excited to see her pero dapat maangas. 

We met sa parahan ng van kung san niya ako hinatid. 

We went straight to the airbnb na binook niya and I got settled. 

She had work that night but the good thing was the airbnb was so close to her workplace. 

I visited her on the job and we had lunch together. 

I met the colleagues that I just talk to online there on that site. 

.. everything went so well but after lunch she said that she would rather spend the rest of the night with me so naghalfday sya just to spend the night. Nagkape kame ulit sa favorite spot niya and it was so great to have her by my side. 

...we call each other babe but it wasn't really that official..

On that night, i leaned in to her. Asked her if she wants this to continue and I asked her to be my girlfriend on the spot. 

.. without hesitation she said yes and I kissed her to seal the deal.  

We didn't do the deed though as it ended up being a confession.

She confessed that this 22 year old girl had a 6 year old daughter .

I was shocked at first but I then realized that she was who she is because of that experience. 

I realized that she was forced to mature despite her age and that she went through a lot more than she should. 

We ended up sleeping together instead without the deed as she brushed my hair. I fell asleep in her thighs like it was a dream. 

I woke up and she was smiling..

I don't know why but she was smiling. 

I think I fell inlove with her that night ..

Morning came and we had breakfast sa restaurant where it sold her favorite dish. Pinaputok na tilapia. 

Sadly it wasn't available at the time. 

We finished the meal and hinatid niya ako ulit. 

We promised that we would make things work no matter what...

Bumyahe nako and at around 8pm from Bulacan nakarating nako ng Baguio. 

I met the boyfriend of my 17 year old sister so I had to go there. 

Anyways, everything else was going well. All the cringy weird messages and everything you could thjnk of. 

I send long sweet messages to her whenever she's asleep so that she appreciates herself everyday.

I send her all the details of my day kahit hanggang pag totoothbrush pa yan.

.... dumating na yung araw na pinaka hihintay namin at sya naman yung babyahe. Siya naman yung pupunta sakin..

I was in Baguio at the time naman. 

This was on the 21st of march and nagbook siya ng airbnb.

Funny thing is. Hindi rin naman siya nag stay sa airbnb. She stayed with me sa bahay namin on that night.

To start off, pagdating niya ng baguio, we went to SM to watch the sunset as she always wanted that. 

Hindi man namin  nakita because it was foggy, it was a very core memory type of scene. 

Yung akala mo hindi na kayo maghihiwalay
..

Uminom kame neto and this was the reason why the relationship had a mark.

... oo hindi namin naubos yu g bote na iniinom namin but we were so tired that we easily got drunk. 

On our way home sa taxi, She told me that I kept mentioning my exs name. Naattach kase ako sa anak ng ex ko that time. She said ""pag wala ka palang malay sya parin pala hinahanap mo"" 

And i was fucked up kase nag black out tlga ako that time..

Gulantang ako hindi ko alam kung pano ako magsosorry at diko din alam kung paano nya ako mapapatawad. 

We didn't talk about it much not knowing that it had a significant impact sakanya. 

We kept going until this day. She broke up with me at 1pm on the 13th of April.

She mentioned that she thought about a lot of things when I went out drinking the night before. 

 Idk if its the trauma but I cant blame her anymore. 

I guess all I can say is atleast we tried.

Any advice about how to deal with this?

Recently i have done a dna test and am still waiting for the results. I started supplementing choline through alpha gpc and instantaneously felt way better. Also my coordination in sports increased as well as my own perception of my stress resilience. I was wondering three things:
1: is alpha gpc the best thing to take if i have a deficiency? Or should i take other forms of choline as well
2: what other nutrients could i may be deficient in? Could that be folic acid or iron perhaps?
3: i drink a loot of coffee. Due to my work in investment banking i got into the habit if sometimes drinking 10 coffee a day for a year now. I was wondering if this could have had any negative effects on my body.

Best regards,

I would love to find a friend for snail mail letters, I do not mind where you are from but if you are German or Czech speaking I would love a chance to develop my ability and write in these languages. In German I am the most proficient. I have spent a lot of my life in Germany and Czechia ü©∑

I come from the small but proud Celtic nation of Cymru (Wales) and love the mountains and forests, but in my heart I am a girl of the sea and I love being by the coast, feeling the sea air, having a swim, enjoying an ice cream and the arcades. 

I'm an experienced outdoors person and to me there is nothing like being in the forest with friends, with beers, a campfire (my phone kept trying to autocorrect that to vampire lmao - that would be a different experience!) and heavy metal blasting. I love hiking, camping, scuba diving and kayaking. 

I am a metal head but I love to wear pink, satin and pearl necklaces. I am a bit kinky and in Berlin clubs like KitKat and Insomnia are my home turf ü©∑

I love plants and gardening, DIY and coffee. 

I am bisexual, believe trans women are women (and vice versa) and am strongly Pro- choice. I am childfree by choice and I have spent much of my life travelling the world and partying, I have no regrets

I'm not just a club rat though, I am a Geologist who adores my science and if you were interested in the Earth sciences that would be so awesome, it would be nice to have friends who love it too. Geology is not just rocks, I would argue it is the story of us ü©∑

I do have mental health conditions but these are controlled, medicated and when I am unwell I seek help. I do not just surrender to it and I don't blame all of my mistakes on it. I believe that attaining good mental health is about expending your comfort zone and being open minded. I have ADHD and Fibromyalgia too which can get to me but again, with medication this is largely controlled and I have still been able to do great things, like backpack solo from Prague to Istanbul via Serbia. 

I have recently left a long term relationship because of domestic abuse and overnight kinda have lost everything, but this will not defeat me and I am glad to have my freedom back. 

I do not want you to think I am a sad, broken woman, I am far from it. I just wanted to disclose these things up front because I believe they could help me find friends who can understand me and where I am at, what I am going through. 

I believe that we have one life, one shot and we deserve to live it happy and according to who we really are. 

As a friend, I am loyal and value honesty, thoughtfulness and care. I love my friends and I am not afraid to tell them so. 

I have often been complimented on my handwriting but to me it often looks like doctors scribble lol üòÇ 

In my long term future I aim to emigrate to Europe to be a student, I want to study MSc Geophysics or Volcanology ü©∑

1jy3pa4,https://i.redd.it/jt48rvovkkue1.png,I'm finally FREE... (17F),"Last month, I found myself trapped in a relationship that had turned toxic. At first, it felt like a heaven on earth but as time went on, his possessiveness began to suffocate me. He would stalk me relentlessly, checking my phone, monitoring my conversations, and forbidding me from talking to anyone else. It was as if he wanted to own me completely, and I felt like I was losing my identity.

I remember the day it all became too much. I was at a coffee shop with a friend, laughing and enjoying our time together. Suddenly, I received a barrage of messages from him, demanding to know who I was with and why I hadn‚Äôt answered his calls. The anxiety washed over me like a tidal wave. I realized I couldn‚Äôt live like this anymore.

That night, I made a decision that would change everything. I sat down and wrote a letter, pouring out my feelings and frustrations. I explained how his behavior was affecting me, how I felt trapped and scared. I knew I had to break free from this toxic cycle.

The next day, I met him at our usual spot. My heart raced as I handed him the letter. He read it, his expression shifting from confusion to anger. He tried to convince me that I was overreacting, that he was just being protective. But deep down, I knew that love shouldn‚Äôt feel like a prison.

‚ÄúI have had enough,‚Äù I finally said, my voice steady despite the fear bubbling inside me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore. I‚Äôm breaking up with you.‚Äù

His reaction was explosive. He shouted, trying to guilt me into staying, but I stood my ground. I had made my choice, and I was ready to reclaim my life. As I walked away, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. It was the hardest decision I had ever made, but it was also the most liberating.

Now, I feel proud that I made the decision to end that toxic cycle. ",1,1744535894.0,TeenIndia,44,0.53,False

I'm a 20-year-old Commerce graduate, currently working in a Big 4 in India. I‚Äôve been with the Forensics team under Risk Consulting for 6 months now. Let me explain what my role involves so you get a sense of where I‚Äôm coming from. My team mainly assists clients‚Äîmostly private equity investors‚Äîwith due diligence checks.

As a Specialist (which is the entry-level role), my work starts with receiving the names of target individuals or entities. I search for them across public databases, government sites, and social media, and take screenshots of every search‚Äîregardless of whether I find anything. If there are any hits, I check if they relate to my target, gather supporting info, and write it up in a report. If nothing comes up, I still have to document and back it up. The report itself is pretty basic‚Äîjust a summary of what the target does, contact details, public domain results, and a short conclusion. The process is super repetitive: fixed list of databases, same search steps, and then writing summaries, often with help from ChatGPT. After that, the report goes to an Associate who reviews it and gets back to me with corrections.

The problem is‚Äîthere‚Äôs absolutely no consulting here. I‚Äôm not learning anything new, there‚Äôs no data analysis, no client interaction, and no real challenge. It‚Äôs brain-dead work. On top of that, the deadlines are intense, and I occasionally breach them because I‚Äôm often pulled into other backend work. My People Manager is chill and doesn‚Äôt nag, but there‚Äôs another Manager who constantly ropes me into Salesforce tasks and client onboarding activities. These tasks are ideally meant for Project Managers, not juniors. I don‚Äôt get chargeable hours for them, and it pushes my actual work behind. Plus, this admin work doesn‚Äôt add much value to my career, aside from saying I‚Äôm familiar with Salesforce.

The team has 40+ people spread across locations. At my office, we have one MD, six Senior Managers/Managers, two Associates, and three Specialists. It‚Äôs a male-dominated team and I‚Äôm the only female junior here. I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of misogynistic comments from a peer, but I didn‚Äôt report it because the team seems to like him more and this fucker is 2 faced asf. He acts polite around the team and shows a completely different side when alone with me, which makes it harder to speak up.

There was another incident where a Senior Manager assigned a task to a Senior Associate, who then dumped it on me after hours without any context. I hadn‚Äôt done that task before and hadn‚Äôt been trained, so I took over an hour to finish it. The next day, the SM pulled me aside and was upset because it had been an urgent client task, and apparently this task would've taken her only 10 minutes but I caused a delay. Later, I overheard her badmouthing me to another Manager, mocking how long I took and how I always stay late in office (which I do just to avoid the crowd and heat). Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that Manager giving me more of the admin and Salesforce work‚Äînone of which the male juniors are asked to do. It‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm being seen as some clueless bimbo. The male juniors get greeted in the mornings, share laughs with seniors, go for coffee, and get high-fives, while I don‚Äôt even get a basic ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù unless there‚Äôs some extra work to be done.

There‚Äôs another vertical in my team that handles Level 2 work‚Äîwhere they reach out to market sources via calls (under false pretexts) to collect information. This work is considered high value and gets the most attention from clients. I thought of doing L2 work to gain more visibility so to learn L2, I volunteered to help with transcripts for these calls. But after listening in, I realized how ethically grey it was, and I don‚Äôt want to compromise on my values for the sake of client deliverables. Unfortunately, now that I‚Äôve started, the Level 2 team keeps pushing me to take up more of their transcripts. Again‚Äîno chargeable hours for this either. And I've not gained any visibility unless it's to give me more work. 

I even reached out to my People Manager and asked if I could be part of more client meetings. He let me attend one and then never again. I‚Äôve also been asking him for a 1-on-1 feedback session for over a month. I reminded him twice, but didn‚Äôt want to keep nagging him. When I reminded him again last week, he said we‚Äôd talk for sure‚Äîbut then left office on Friday without speaking to me. I was planning to use that meeting to bring up all these issues and to ask if I could explore other teams within the Line of Service. I feel like I‚Äôm not learning anything meaningful and my work has become painfully mundane.

I don‚Äôt have a strong relationship with my PM, and I haven‚Äôt pushed harder because of the sexist comments I‚Äôve received from that peer about me and my PM. On top of that, the managers have their own cliques and are often gossiping about each other. Honestly, the whole team feels toxic at this point and I want out.

When I joined as a trainee, we were told during onboarding that we‚Äôre allowed to explore different teams based on our interests. I really want to do that now‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I‚Äôm interested in finance, management consulting, India markets, PE strategy, or even the government sector teams. I‚Äôd love to work in any of those, but I‚Äôm worried I might not have the right skill set. I‚Äôm also scared of ending up in a team that‚Äôs even worse than my current one.

How can I request a transfer without causing bad blood? I know people will judge me regardless, but I‚Äôd rather work somewhere I can grow. Also, are there other SBUs within the firm where the work is less brain-dead and more strategic? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to make the most of this experience without feeling exploited and invisible.

There‚Äôs another vertical in my team that handles Level 2 work‚Äîwhere they reach out to market sources via calls (under false pretexts) to collect information.

I even reached out to my People Manager and asked if I could be part of more client meetings. He let me attend one and then never again.

I was planning to use that meeting to bring up all these issues and to ask if I could explore other teams within the Line of Service. I feel like I‚Äôm not learning anything meaningful and my work has become painfully mundane.

I don‚Äôt have a strong relationship with my PM, and I haven‚Äôt pushed harder because of the sexist comments I‚Äôve received from that peer about me and my PM. On top of that, the managers have their own cliques and are often gossiping about each other. Honestly, the whole team feels toxic at this point and I want out.

When I joined as a trainee, we were told during onboarding that we‚Äôre allowed to explore different teams based on our interests. I really want to do that now‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I‚Äôm interested in finance, management consulting, India markets, PE strategy, or even the government sector teams. I‚Äôd love to work in any of those, but I‚Äôm worried I might not have the right skill set. I‚Äôm also scared of ending up in a team that‚Äôs even worse than my current one.

How can I request a transfer without causing bad blood? I know people will judge me regardless, but I‚Äôd rather work somewhere I can grow. Also, are there other SBUs within the firm where the work is less brain-dead and more strategic? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to make the most of this experience without feeling exploited and invisible.

I never did anything wrong yet he didnt even let me defend myself from his accusations and just ghosted me completely. I finally sent him my last message. Wish him luck and deleted his number.

I love it when my build is at limits and cant push more so I just make myself a coffee, light up a cig and open PoB and theory craft for a good while. Now that I have played poured 500+ hours into this game, I think GGG missed whole point of Poe, it being a game where you overcome limits of your build rather than doing rotations,like, am I doing Mythic+ in WoW or what ?

   Skill gems being tied to weapon types and massive attribute requirements, support gems having huge downsides, passive tree having only handful of useful nodes which makes it you dont even really need to push above 80+ level anymore etc‚Ä¶ 

   And also, point of gems being not socketed into gear were told by devs to provide ‚Äúmore freedom‚Äù. It seems GGG pulled off a classic ‚ÄúBait & Switch‚Äù to its‚Äô customers. Everything we have been told since 3 years up until now have been revamped and honestly Im not sure if it feels PoE anymore, which is, ‚ÄúSandbox-Levels of build diversity‚Äù ARPG.

   All made me realize I would have stopped playing this game earlier than now if this was not named Path of Exile and honestly if this is the direction the game is going to go from now onwards, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúplay campaign once uninstall good game‚Äù type of players are going to be playing this game more than couple more weeks. And once we have Poe1 league we will see how much of numbers Poe2 will hold with their new target audience.

Just my two cents as someone who played both games combined 2.5k hours.

I'm a 20-year-old Commerce graduate, currently working in a Big 4 in India. I‚Äôve been with the Forensics team under Risk Consulting for 6 months now. Let me explain what my role involves so you get a sense of where I‚Äôm coming from. My team mainly assists clients‚Äîmostly private equity investors‚Äîwith due diligence checks.

As a Specialist (which is the entry-level role), my work starts with receiving the names of target individuals or entities. I search for them across public databases, government sites, and social media, and take screenshots of every search‚Äîregardless of whether I find anything. If there are any hits, I check if they relate to my target, gather supporting info, and write it up in a report. If nothing comes up, I still have to document and back it up. The report itself is pretty basic‚Äîjust a summary of what the target does, contact details, public domain results, and a short conclusion. The process is super repetitive: fixed list of databases, same search steps, and then writing summaries, often with help from ChatGPT. After that, the report goes to an Associate who reviews it and gets back to me with corrections.

The problem is‚Äîthere‚Äôs absolutely no consulting here. I‚Äôm not learning anything new, there‚Äôs no data analysis, no client interaction, and no real challenge. It‚Äôs brain-dead work. On top of that, the deadlines are intense, and I occasionally breach them because I‚Äôm often pulled into other backend work. My People Manager is chill and doesn‚Äôt nag, but there‚Äôs another Manager who constantly ropes me into Salesforce tasks and client onboarding activities. These tasks are ideally meant for Project Managers, not juniors. I don‚Äôt get chargeable hours for them, and it pushes my actual work behind. Plus, this admin work doesn‚Äôt add much value to my career, aside from saying I‚Äôm familiar with Salesforce.

The team has 40+ people spread across locations. At my office, we have one MD, six Senior Managers/Managers, two Associates, and three Specialists. It‚Äôs a male-dominated team and I‚Äôm the only female junior here. I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of misogynistic comments from a peer, but I didn‚Äôt report it because the team seems to like him more and this fucker is 2 faced asf. He acts polite around the team and shows a completely different side when alone with me, which makes it harder to speak up.

There was another incident where a Senior Manager assigned a task to a Senior Associate, who then dumped it on me after hours without any context. I hadn‚Äôt done that task before and hadn‚Äôt been trained, so I took over an hour to finish it. The next day, the SM pulled me aside and was upset because it had been an urgent client task, and apparently this task would've taken her only 10 minutes but I caused a delay. Later, I overheard her badmouthing me to another Manager, mocking how long I took and how I always stay late in office (which I do just to avoid the crowd and heat). Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that Manager giving me more of the admin and Salesforce work‚Äînone of which the male juniors are asked to do. It‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm being seen as some clueless bimbo. The male juniors get greeted in the mornings, share laughs with seniors, go for coffee, and get high-fives, while I don‚Äôt even get a basic ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù unless there‚Äôs some extra work to be done.

Our friendship has had slightly flirty undertones for the past few months. I feel a strong connection to him and think we have good chemistry but I‚Äôm finding it hard to tell whether he just likes the attention/company or actually likes me.¬†We are both single. 

He definitely has other female friends in the workplace who he talks to quite often (more often than me, to be honest). He frequently messages them in a private chat on slack and will come up to them and talk to them in the office.¬†One of the other female coworkers he chats to sits next to me, and he'll come and talk to her but doesn't chat to me and turns his body away from me/only focuses on the coworker, even if I say something.

On the other hand, he rarely approaches me to chat in the office but often asks if I want to go on a walk/get coffee with him outside of the office. We used to just leave the office together to do this but recently I‚Äôve started to get the vibe he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen leaving the office with me alone and we will separately leave and meet outside.¬†

Once, we were both in late and left the office at the same time, he walked with me to my bus stop which was much further away from the office than his bus stop, just to continue the chat. We live in a safe area so it wasn‚Äôt a safety-related concern.¬†

A couple of times, he‚Äôs randomly messaged me late at night on our work slack with a flimsy work-related excuse (e.g. asking me about stuff there would be no need to message me about at 11 pm on a Friday). I‚Äôve never replied to any of these messages until the next working day.¬†

He still talks to the other female friends and seems to have an affectionate relationship with them, and smiles and looks affectionately/attentively at them when he chats to them.

I‚Äôm not sure if he just likes the attention from me (maybe he‚Äôs also asking them to hang out and they just decline) or just likes to be seen in public with me. I say this completely objectively (and as someone who does genuinely have feelings for David) but I am a lot more ‚Äòconventionally attractive‚Äô than him.

I think if I didn‚Äôt work with him I‚Äôd be a bit more forward in trying to find out how he actually feels about me, but it‚Äôs difficult in the circumstances. We are both white collar professionals and have good stable jobs. We‚Äôre at the same level of seniority in the organisation and work in the same team, but  don‚Äôt directly work on projects with each other. ¬†I get on really well with him and could honestly see myself being in a relationship with him, but I‚Äôm just not sure of his motives.",7,1744535517.0,bodylanguage,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of misogynistic comments from a peer, but I didn‚Äôt report it because the team seems to like him more and this fucker is 2 faced asf. He acts polite around the team and shows a completely different side when alone with me, which makes it harder to speak up.

There was another incident where a Senior Manager assigned a task to a Senior Associate, who then dumped it on me after hours without any context. I hadn‚Äôt done that task before and hadn‚Äôt been trained, so I took over an hour to finish it. The next day, the SM pulled me aside and was upset because it had been an urgent client task, and apparently this task would've taken her only 10 minutes but I caused a delay. Later, I overheard her badmouthing me to another Manager, mocking how long I took and how I always stay late in office (which I do just to avoid the crowd and heat). Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that Manager giving me more of the admin and Salesforce work‚Äînone of which the male juniors are asked to do. It‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm being seen as some clueless bimbo. The male juniors get greeted in the mornings, share laughs with seniors, go for coffee, and get high-fives, while I don‚Äôt even get a basic ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù unless there‚Äôs some extra work to be done.

There‚Äôs another vertical in my team that handles Level 2 work‚Äîwhere they reach out to market sources via calls (under false pretexts) to collect information. This work is considered high value and gets the most attention from clients. I thought of doing L2 work to gain more visibility so to learn L2, I volunteered to help with transcripts for these calls. But after listening in, I realized how ethically grey it was, and I don‚Äôt want to compromise on my values for the sake of client deliverables. Unfortunately, now that I‚Äôve started, the Level 2 team keeps pushing me to take up more of their transcripts. Again‚Äîno chargeable hours for this either. And I've not gained any visibility unless it's to give me more work. 

I even reached out to my People Manager and asked if I could be part of more client meetings. He let me attend one and then never again. I‚Äôve also been asking him for a 1-on-1 feedback session for over a month. I reminded him twice, but didn‚Äôt want to keep nagging him. When I reminded him again last week, he said we‚Äôd talk for sure‚Äîbut then left office on Friday without speaking to me. I was planning to use that meeting to bring up all these issues and to ask if I could explore other teams within the Line of Service. I feel like I‚Äôm not learning anything meaningful and my work has become painfully mundane.

I don‚Äôt have a strong relationship with my PM, and I haven‚Äôt pushed harder because of the sexist comments I‚Äôve received from that peer about me and my PM. On top of that, the managers have their own cliques and are often gossiping about each other. Honestly, the whole team feels toxic at this point and I want out.

When I joined as a trainee, we were told during onboarding that we‚Äôre allowed to explore different teams based on our interests. I really want to do that now‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I‚Äôm interested in finance, management consulting, India markets, PE strategy, or even the government sector teams. I‚Äôd love to work in any of those, but I‚Äôm worried I might not have the right skill set. I‚Äôm also scared of ending up in a team that‚Äôs even worse than my current one.

How can I request a transfer without causing bad blood? I know people will judge me regardless, but I‚Äôd rather work somewhere I can grow. Also, are there other SBUs within the firm where the work is less brain-dead and more strategic? I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to make the most of this experience without feeling exploited and invisible.

SATURDAY April 13th 1912 - The Olympic sets sail from New York bound for Southampton via Plymouth and Cherbourg, the eastbound leg of her first voyage with Herbert Haddock as Captain. Unfortunately for Haddock, the westbound leg was not without incident. It was marred by the death of first class passenger Barton Harvey on board shortly before the Olympic arrived in New York on April 10th.

12:00PM - Sailing at an average speed of 20.91 knots, Titanic has covered 519 miles on her second full day out at sea. The Engineering Crew prepare to put on more speed and the engine's are brought up to 75 revolutions per minute. The ship now begins moving through the water at approximately 22 knots. 

1:30PM - After luncheon, first class passenger Elizabeth Lines sits down to coffee in the Reception Room on D Deck with her daughter Mary. A short time later, White Star Line chairman and Captain Smith arrive and are seated nearby. Lines overhears them discussing the day's run and and Ismay saying, ""We will beat the Olympic's record and get into New York on Tuesday."" Ismay and Smith also discuss the possibility of lighting the last of Titanic's boilers so the ship can undertake a full speed run on Monday once the icefield has been passed.

Late Afternoon - The forward starboard side coal bunker of Boiler Room 5, Bunker W, is emptied and with that the fire that started before the Titanic left Southampton is extinguished. With the bunker empty and more coal stored on the other side of the ship, she is now listing 2 degrees to her port side. 

8:00PM - In Titanic's Marconi Room, 25-year-old Senior Operator Jack Phillips relieves Junior Operator Harold Bride, aged 22, and he begins his six hour shift at the wireless key. Bride will now retire for the evening and get some sleep before taking the next watch.

11:00PM - Titanic's Marconi wireless transmitter breaks down. Even though he is meant to run off emergency power and wait for a technician to repair the set in port, Jack Phillips decides to wake Harold Bride and the two men set about taking the apparatus apart and attempting to fix it. If Phillips and Bride are unsuccessful, they will be forced to run the system of the emergency power supply which will significantly limit their transmitting range.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The core of Carolans Irish Cream Liqueur lies in its carefully selected ingredients and meticulous production process.

**Base Spirit:** Carolans uses a blend of Irish whiskey and other spirits to create its foundation.

The inclusion of Irish whiskey provides a subtle warmth and complexity that distinguishes it from cream liqueurs based solely on neutral grain spirits. This blend contributes to the overall smoothness and helps to balance the sweetness of the cream. While the exact proportions are proprietary, the presence of whiskey is a defining characteristic.

**Fresh Irish Cream:** The cream used in Carolans is sourced directly from farms in Ireland.

This fresh cream is a significant factor in the liqueur's rich and velvety texture. The quality of the dairy contributes greatly to the overall mouthfeel and flavor, providing a smooth and luxurious experience on the palate. Using local ingredients also ensures a consistent supply and freshness that is vital for maintaining the product's quality.

**Honey Flavoring:** A touch of honey is added to enhance the sweetness and complexity.

Unlike some Irish creams that rely solely on sugar, Carolans incorporates honey to add a subtle floral note and depth of flavor. The honey complements the whiskey and cream, creating a more nuanced and balanced profile. This touch of honey adds a natural sweetness that is less cloying than pure sugar.

**Cocoa and Vanilla:** These natural flavorings contribute to the overall flavor profile.

The addition of cocoa and vanilla enhances the richness and complexity of the liqueur, complementing the whiskey, cream, and honey notes. These flavorings provide a familiar and comforting taste, making Carolans approachable and enjoyable for a wide range of palates. The subtle cocoa notes balance out the sweetness, while the vanilla adds a smooth and creamy dimension.

**Lower Alcohol Content:** Carolans typically has an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 17%.

This lower ABV makes it more approachable and easier to drink than some higher-proof liqueurs. The lower alcohol content contributes to the smoothness of the drink and makes it a versatile ingredient for cocktails and coffee. It also allows the other flavors, like the cream, honey, and cocoa, to shine through without being overshadowed by the alcohol.

**Smooth and Creamy Texture:** The use of fresh Irish cream results in a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel.

The high-quality cream provides a velvety texture that is both satisfying and enjoyable. The smooth texture enhances the drinking experience and makes it a pleasant addition to any drink. This smooth and creamy texture is a key differentiator for Carolans and contributes to its overall appeal.

**Balanced Flavor Profile:** The blend of whiskey, cream, honey, cocoa, and vanilla creates a harmonious and well-rounded flavor.

The combination of these flavors creates a complex and enjoyable taste experience that is not overly sweet or cloying.

1jy3ein,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jy3ein/aita_for_my_thoughts_on_this/,AITA for my thoughts on this?,"Im 26f married to husband 33m for over a year now. From the uk. 
Im peed off because my husbands mum asks him for money every month. Partner and I are saving together to buy a house and though she doesn't ask for much but we still struggle because of it. Today she asked for 40¬£, last month she asked for ¬£150. I spoke to my husband about it today and told him it's an issue because if we have our own family and have kids, we'd be struggling because of this. He reassured me and told me it won't come to this because he will be making more money from work, hell be getting raises. . I understood and understand how hard life can be and it's hard to even get a stable job these days so I don't really blame that she's asking my husband for money. 

My mil also  has a grown ass son and a husband, my husband told me that her husband pays for all her bills already and also his brother pays for all the groceries and also runs out of money. I just find it abit annoying if im honest even though I do understand or try to understand this... and my husband does pay all our bills so I'm not fussed. I don't really pay for anything other than bits and bobs here and there and electic which he also tops so I kind of do think I'm in the wrong.  It's just that he said today he doesn't even spend a penny on himself and.he works literally long hours....so I felt bad. Also, we went for a coffee together today and I felt bitter with the fact that he could give his mum 40¬£ but couldn't me out for a meal today, he said we were running out of money and need to save and suggested that we go for a coffee together which ofc I was fine with until he sent his mum money. I do understand it's his money and he can do whatever he wants with it I know.... I make my own money and take driving lessons and pay for my own course im taking. I put money away for our first home together, he contributes if he can. 
The thing is we are saving for a house and tho he does put away money when he can but that money that he be giving to his mum couldve been used towards our savings even. I honestly dislike her for this a lot. His older brother is married and has children and does not send his mum money, never did even before.  My partner earns decent amount. I'm posting because i kinda wanna get other people's opinions and also wanna know if im actually being a bitch. Today she asked him for money cos she has knee issues and wanted to go for acupuncture which helps her knee issue and she was in so much pain. My husband is kind and he even said he'd give me money too if I asked and even if we had kids he'd provide. I'm not exactly sure why I'm pressed but it could be cos of the fact we couldve saved more or that money couldve been spent on other things. My mil is a nice person but I seriously don't like her cos of this. It just feel like it's going to be an issue in the future...like why can't my mil understand that he is married now and he's going to have kids were trying to buy our first home...if i had kids i wouldn't ask them if they were married and saving for a place, I'd be understanding about this. Idk maybe we just grew up different. ",0,1744534564.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Last meal I had was mince/ground beef, bacon and eggs cooked in butter and some salt on Thursday evening. The next day I then had 5ltrs of water spread throughout the day and two cups of black coffee spread throughout the day. I didn't do anything strenuous that day, but was around the house doing odd jobs and went for a ride on my motorcycle. Went to the bathroom multiple times throughout the day.

Saturday I woke up and felt great, refreshed and alert, went to the bathroom and then weighed myself. Total loss for about 37hrs fasting 0.1kg. 

Am I doing something wrong? 

I had 2 eggs some butter and 4 slices of bacon for lunch and then 5 burger patties with cheese for dinner and I've dropped 0.5kg by this morning.

I feel better now, could it have been a one-off from new meds?","I haven't vomited since 2012 when I drank too much one night. I made sure after that to never have more than two drinks 

Anyway, I have bipolar as well as other things. My doctor switched me from 42mg Caplyta to 21mg and added 500mg Depakote ER. Been on it a few days. I also take Rosuvastatin for cholesterol. Oh, and Hydroxyzine 25mg, and as for other stuff a multivitamin, vitamin D, Omega-3, CoQ10, and Reservation. 

I had some other psych meds that did not play well with me like Olanzapine, so it's been a trial and error thing. But nothing ever did this. My first thought in the AM was food poisoning. I've had that multiple times, but it never made me barf, all the action was lower, and it always came with a high fever and massive headache. This presented as extreme abdominal pain. 

From 5:30am to 8:00am 8 managed to keep it together lying still, but not asleep. 8am I knew I had to run to the bathroom. I have never vomited black. By black, I mean pitch. After that I used the toilet for part two of the catastrophe, took some pill my wife gave me for the bowel issues, drank a Gatorade and went to bed. I woke up at 5 feeling mostly better.

My stomach still hurts, but not in a sick way, in a physical way like the cramping pulled a muscle. But I just now almost 24 hours later read that pitch black vomit could mean GI bleed. And that it could be life-threatening. Wouldn't I have noticed by now if that were it? I mean I had two cups of coffee since, a bowl of bean soup, a few cookies, lots of Gatorade, and the nausea is completely gone. I do have some indegestion, but it kind of feels more like hunger pains. That bowl of soup was all I had yesterday.

I just don't want to waste the doctor's time, just for them to bill me $40 for my copay to tell me to take Pepto and stay hydrated. So can black vomit be other things or is it always the end of the line?",0,1744534093.0,AskDocs,2,0.5,False

I‚Äôve tried to adjust the internal ring but I fear my burrs are misaligned or worse

(F/F tickling) -Short,"The Sunday afternoon sunlight spilled lazily into the living room, where Maria sat stretched across the couch, her bare feet propped comfortably on an ottoman. She was scrolling through her phone, her glasses perched at the tip of her nose, enjoying a rare moment of quiet.

Her daughter, Sophie, perched mischievously at the edge of the coffee table, twirling a pen between her fingers as a playful grin spread across her face. At 15 years old, Sophie was the definition of a little trickster‚Äîquick-witted, sharp-eyed, and always on the hunt for an opportunity to mess with her mom in a loving, lighthearted way.

‚ÄúHey, Mom,‚Äù Sophie said, snapping Maria out of her scrolling trance.

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù Maria hummed, not looking up.

‚ÄúI have an idea for a challenge.‚Äù

Maria arched an eyebrow, finally glancing over her phone. ‚ÄúOh no. What now?‚Äù

Sophie grinned wider. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called The Still Feet Challenge. You have to keep your feet still while I‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused dramatically, ‚Äú...tickle them.‚Äù

Maria sat up straighter immediately, pulling her feet back as if she‚Äôd been burned. ‚ÄúSophie! No way. Absolutely not.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on! It‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù Sophie teased, her voice lilting. ‚ÄúYou love a challenge, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that ticklish,‚Äù Maria argued, though her face betrayed her nervousness as she tucked her feet under her legs.

Sophie‚Äôs eyes sparkled. ‚ÄúOh, really? You‚Äôre not that ticklish? Well then, this will be easy for you. Prove it!‚Äù

Maria stared at her daughter for a long moment, debating whether to play along. She‚Äôd never admit that her feet were her absolute weakest spot.

Finally, she sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúFine. You get five minutes. But I will keep my feet still.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal!‚Äù Sophie chirped, grabbing her phone to set a timer.

‚ÄúWait, wait, wait. I need rules,‚Äù Maria said, pointing a finger. ‚ÄúNo cheating. And no‚Äîwhat do you call it?‚Äî‚Äòintense‚Äô tickling. Just light stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Mom,‚Äù Sophie replied far too innocently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be gentle. Promise.‚Äù

Maria shot her a wary look but reluctantly stretched her legs back out, placing her bare feet‚Äîslender, smooth, and lightly tanned‚Äîon the ottoman once again. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this over with.‚Äù

Sophie cracked her knuckles jokingly. ‚ÄúReady when you are.‚Äù

Maria took a deep breath as the timer began. Sophie leaned in closer, examining her mom‚Äôs feet like a scientist about to conduct an experiment. Her mom‚Äôs toes curled slightly in anticipation, the tension obvious.

‚ÄúRelax, Mom,‚Äù Sophie teased as she wiggled her fingers dramatically in the air. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making this too easy already.‚Äù

Maria groaned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm relaxed! Just‚Ä¶ get on with it.‚Äù

Without another word, Sophie reached out and gently ran her nails down the length of her mom‚Äôs left sole, starting at the heel and moving up to the base of her toes.

Maria‚Äôs entire body tensed, and she slapped a hand over her mouth as she burst into muffled giggles. Her toes twitched, and her foot jerked slightly.

‚ÄúHa! You moved!‚Äù Sophie declared triumphantly.

‚ÄúI did not!‚Äù Maria protested between soft chuckles, her voice high-pitched already. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it counts,‚Äù Sophie replied with a grin. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs keep going. You‚Äôre doing great, Mom.‚Äù

Sophie adjusted her approach, this time using just her fingertips to dance lightly across Maria‚Äôs arches. The sensation was light and fluttery‚Äîbarely there‚Äîbut for Maria, it was unbearable.

‚ÄúAhh! Haha! Sophie, stop!‚Äù Maria squealed, throwing her head back and clamping her fists onto the couch cushion. She tried desperately to keep her feet still, but the muscles in her legs quivered with the effort.

‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre already losing!‚Äù Sophie laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only been one minute!‚Äù

Maria gasped for air, her laughter now flowing freely as Sophie‚Äôs fingers moved faster. Her nails scratched lightly along the sides of Maria‚Äôs feet, up and down, back and forth, leaving no spot untouched.

‚ÄúSophie! Hahahaha! You‚Äôre evil!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gentle! You said gentle,‚Äù Sophie teased, her nails now focusing on the base of her mom‚Äôs toes. She wiggled her fingertips there with just enough pressure to make Maria‚Äôs toes spasm involuntarily.

‚ÄúNOOOO! Not the toes!‚Äù Maria cried, her laughter turning into squeals. Her feet wiggled frantically against her will, betraying her determination to win the challenge.

Sophie smirked. ‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt that ticklish, Mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lied! Hahaha! Sophie, stop! I‚Äôm going to‚Äîhahaha‚Äîlose my mind!‚Äù

Sophie ignored the plea, determined to make the most of her five minutes. She grabbed Maria‚Äôs right foot gently, holding it still by the ankle as her nails scribbled rapidly along the arch and instep.

Maria howled with laughter, tears forming in the corners of her eyes. ‚ÄúI CAN‚ÄôT! Hahaha! I CAN‚ÄôT DO THIS!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost halfway there,‚Äù Sophie announced proudly, her voice light and teasing. She slowed her movements slightly, this time tracing little shapes‚Äîcircles, stars, and hearts‚Äîon the soles of Maria‚Äôs feet.

‚ÄúAre you‚Äîhahaha‚Äîdrawing on my feet?!‚Äù Maria gasped, kicking her legs slightly as her laughter spilled out uncontrollably.

‚ÄúYup. Artistic talent, Mom. Hold still!‚Äù Sophie replied, trying not to laugh herself.

Maria‚Äôs laughter echoed through the house, her attempts to stay still growing more futile by the second. ‚ÄúSophie! You‚Äôre enjoying this too much!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having the time of my life,‚Äù Sophie admitted, grinning ear to ear.

The final minute ticked down, and Sophie went in for her ‚Äúgrand finale.‚Äù She used all ten fingertips, fluttering them across both soles at once, her nails skittering like little feathers.

Maria‚Äôs entire body tensed as she screamed with laughter, thrashing so hard that she nearly fell off the couch. ‚ÄúSTOP! Hahahaha! I CAN‚ÄôT TAKE IT ANYMORE!‚Äù

The timer finally beeped, signaling the end of the challenge. Sophie sat back triumphantly, wiping tears of laughter from her own eyes as Maria flopped back onto the couch like a ragdoll.

‚ÄúFive minutes!‚Äù Sophie announced, beaming with pride. ‚ÄúYou made it, Mom‚Äîwell, kind of.‚Äù

Maria gasped for breath, her face flushed and her hair a mess. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ are evil,‚Äù she panted, though a smile tugged at her lips.

‚ÄúYou moved so much,‚Äù Sophie teased. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll still give you a passing grade.‚Äù

Maria shook her head, laughing softly as she sat up. ‚ÄúYou are grounded.‚Äù

Sophie giggled, leaning over to give her mom a quick hug. ‚ÄúYou love me.‚Äù

Maria couldn‚Äôt help but smile. ‚ÄúI do. But don‚Äôt ever challenge me to that again!‚Äù

Sophie grinned wickedly. ‚ÄúNo promises, Mom.‚Äù",1,1744533816.0,ticklingstories,0,1.0,False

The kind of look that told Noah that Gerald was already deciding how to deal with him.

And this time, it wasn‚Äôt going to end with a simple warning.

Noah could feel it in the weight of Gerald‚Äôs voice when he said, ‚ÄúMy office. Now.‚Äù

As he trailed behind Gerald, Noah‚Äôs palms were damp with sweat. He didn‚Äôt want to lose his job. With bills piling up and Nadia already stressed about their finances, another fight about his employment‚Äîor lack of it‚Äîwould tip their marriage into dangerous territory.

When the office door clicked shut behind them, Gerald gestured toward the chair opposite his desk. ‚ÄúSit,‚Äù he said.

Noah obeyed, his heart pounding in his chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been late five times this month,‚Äù Gerald began, his tone clipped. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm being generous by not including the days last month or the month before that. This is a pattern, Noah, and frankly, it‚Äôs unacceptable.‚Äù

Noah squirmed under the weight of Gerald‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúI know, sir. I‚ÄîI‚Äôm really sorry. It won‚Äôt happen again, I promise.‚Äù

Gerald leaned forward, steepling his fingers. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said that before.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but this time I mean it,‚Äù Noah stammered. ‚ÄúPlease, Mr. Price, I really need this job. My wife and I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, Nadia.‚Äù Gerald interrupted, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Noah froze. The way Gerald said her name made him uneasy, as though he knew something he shouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYes, Nadia,‚Äù Noah said cautiously. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting on this paycheck to make ends meet. Please, I‚Äôll do anything to prove myself. Just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt fire me.‚Äù

Gerald leaned back in his chair, studying Noah with an expression that was both calculating and faintly amused. ‚ÄúAnything, you say?‚Äù

Noah nodded, desperation tightening his throat. ‚ÄúYes, anything.‚Äù

There was a long pause. Then Gerald spoke.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you a deal, Noah. I won‚Äôt fire you. But in return, I need you to‚Ä¶persuade your wife to assist me with something.‚Äù

Noah blinked, confusion washing over him. ‚ÄúAssist you? With what?‚Äù

Gerald‚Äôs smirk widened. ‚ÄúI happen to know that your wife is‚Ä¶exceptionally ticklish.‚Äù

Noah‚Äôs stomach dropped. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer feet, specifically,‚Äù Gerald continued, as if Noah hadn‚Äôt spoken. ‚ÄúAnd her ribs. I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs quite sensitive in those areas.‚Äù

Noah felt heat rising to his face. ‚ÄúHow‚Äîhow do you know that?‚Äù

Gerald shrugged, feigning nonchalance. ‚ÄúYou mentioned it once during a team lunch. Something about her being unable to sit through a pedicure without laughing hysterically. I‚Äôm very observant, Noah. I don‚Äôt forget details like that.‚Äù

Noah stared at him, disbelief mingling with dread. ‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with my job?‚Äù

Gerald‚Äôs gaze hardened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. I have‚Ä¶a fascination with ticklish people. Nothing inappropriate, of course. But it‚Äôs a form of stress relief for me‚Äîexploring their reactions, testing techniques. Your wife would be the perfect subject. If she agrees to let me tickle her, I‚Äôll forget about your tardiness. If not‚Ä¶‚Äù He let the sentence hang ominously in the air.

Noah‚Äôs mind raced. This had to be some kind of joke, right? But Gerald‚Äôs expression was deadly serious.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd be comfortable with that,‚Äù Noah stammered.

Gerald raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for her to decide, isn‚Äôt it? All I‚Äôm asking is that you explain the situation to her. If she agrees, I‚Äôll even allow you to be present during the session, so you can see for yourself that it‚Äôs entirely above board. No harm, no foul.‚Äù

Noah felt trapped. Saying no would almost certainly cost him his job. But saying yes meant dragging Nadia into a situation that was, at best, deeply uncomfortable.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶need to talk to her,‚Äù he said finally.

Gerald smiled, a predator sensing victory. ‚ÄúOf course. Take the weekend to discuss it with her. Let me know your decision by Monday.‚Äù

The weekend felt like it stretched forever, yet somehow, Noah dreaded how fast Monday arrived.

When he first brought up Gerald‚Äôs proposition to Nadia, she thought it was a joke‚Äîa cruel, absurd joke. But Noah‚Äôs expression, riddled with shame and desperation, told her otherwise.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù she had asked, folding her arms tightly. Her wide brown eyes, usually warm, burned with indignation. ‚ÄúYou actually want me to go along with this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Noah had exclaimed quickly, holding his hands up. ‚ÄúOf course not! I hate this! But, Nadia, if I lose this job‚Ä¶we‚Äôre screwed. Rent‚Äôs due. Credit cards are maxed out. We can‚Äôt keep asking your sister for loans.‚Äù His voice cracked, the weight of his failures pressing down on him. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶at least think about it.‚Äù

The silence between them was suffocating. Finally, Nadia spoke, her voice low and sharp. ‚ÄúI hope you know how humiliating this is‚Äîfor both of us.‚Äù

Monday, Gerald's place:

The living room was silent except for the sound of Gerald fastening the last restraint. The thick, padded cuffs around Nadia‚Äôs wrists and ankles were secure but didn‚Äôt bite into her skin. Her arms were pinned to the armrests, and her ankles were firmly tied to a padded stool in front of her, leaving her completely immobile. Her bare feet were positioned at just the right angle for Gerald‚Äôs reach, her toes slightly spread.

Noah sat on the couch, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt like a coward‚Äîwatching his wife being restrained like this‚Äîbut he was powerless. He‚Äôd made the choice, and now they both had to live with it.

Gerald, however, looked completely calm as he adjusted his shirt cuffs. He stepped back, surveying Nadia like a sculptor admiring his latest creation. ‚ÄúWell, I must say, this is an excellent setup,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúComfortable enough, I hope?‚Äù

Nadia glared at him, her lips pressed into a firm line. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get this over with,‚Äù she snapped, her voice laced with defiance.

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôll take our time,‚Äù Gerald said smoothly, his tone almost mocking. ‚ÄúAfter all, I‚Äôve been looking forward to this.‚Äù

Noah felt his stomach twist as Gerald knelt in front of Nadia‚Äôs feet, his fingers hovering just inches away.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Gerald began conversationally, ‚Äúthe feet are one of the most sensitive areas of the body. There‚Äôs something fascinating about how the slightest touch can provoke such strong reactions. Let‚Äôs see just how sensitive yours are, shall we?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù Nadia started, but the moment Gerald‚Äôs fingers made contact, her sentence dissolved into an involuntary squeal.

He began slowly, using a single index finger to trace a deliberate line down the sole of her right foot. Nadia flinched hard, her toes curling instinctively as she gasped.

‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Gerald murmured, a hint of amusement in his voice. ‚ÄúAlready so reactive, and I‚Äôve barely started.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Nadia demanded, twisting in the chair. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny!‚Äù

Gerald ignored her, shifting his focus to her left foot. He used both hands this time, his fingers lightly grazing the arches. The reaction was instantaneous‚ÄîNadia burst into uncontrollable laughter, her body jerking against the restraints as if she could escape by sheer willpower.

‚ÄúNo! No, no, no!‚Äù she cried between fits of laughter, her voice high-pitched and desperate. ‚ÄúPlease, stop! I can‚Äôt‚ÄîI can‚Äôt take it!‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, fascinating,‚Äù Gerald mused, as though he were studying a scientific experiment. He switched techniques, using his nails to lightly scratch just below her toes.

Nadia let out a shriek, her head thrown back as tears formed in the corners of her eyes. ‚ÄúNot there! Not there! Please!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, the toes,‚Äù Gerald remarked, his voice calm despite her frantic reactions. ‚ÄúAlways a good spot. Let‚Äôs see how thorough we can be.‚Äù

He began to focus on her toes, gently holding each one between his fingers and wiggling his nails along the base. Nadia‚Äôs laughter became frantic, almost hysterical, her struggles growing more desperate as she tried to pull her feet away, only to be thwarted by the restraints.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù she gasped, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm begging you‚Äîplease stop!‚Äù

From his place on the couch, Noah‚Äôs hands clenched into fists. He wanted to intervene, to yell at Gerald to leave her alone‚Äîbut he couldn‚Äôt. He had agreed to this, and his job depended on it.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs explore another technique,‚Äù Gerald said, his voice maddeningly calm. He pulled out a small, soft-bristled brush from his pocket and held it up for both of them to see. ‚ÄúThis is excellent for targeting the finer nerves. Let‚Äôs see how it works on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Nadia whimpered, shaking her head as tears streamed down her face. ‚ÄúNo, please, not that!‚Äù

But Gerald was already at work, dragging the brush slowly across her soles in long, deliberate strokes. The sensation was unbearable‚ÄîNadia‚Äôs laughter reached a fever pitch as she thrashed wildly in the chair.

‚ÄúI‚Äîcan‚Äôt‚Äîbreathe!‚Äù she choked out between fits of laughter, her words barely coherent. ‚ÄúStop it, please!‚Äù

Gerald didn‚Äôt stop. If anything, he seemed more determined. He alternated between using the brush on her arches and his fingers on the delicate skin beneath her toes, constantly changing his technique to keep her guessing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite the challenge,‚Äù Gerald remarked, sounding almost impressed. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve only just begun.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo more!‚Äù Nadia screamed, her voice hoarse. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take any more!‚Äù

After what felt like an eternity, Gerald finally stopped, standing up and wiping his hands on a cloth. Nadia slumped forward in the chair, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath.

‚ÄúYou held up well,‚Äù Gerald said with a smirk. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù

Nadia‚Äôs eyes widened in alarm. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äîwhat do you mean? You said it was just my feet!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I did say that, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù Gerald replied with mock innocence. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm curious about your upper body as well. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit won‚Äôt take long.‚Äù

Noah felt his stomach drop as Gerald moved behind Nadia and placed his hands lightly on her ribs.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Nadia whimpered, shaking her head frantically. ‚ÄúNot there! Please, not there!‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Gerald said, his voice almost soothing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just testing your limits.‚Äù

He began to knead her ribs gently, his fingers pressing into the spaces between each bone. Nadia erupted into another fit of laughter, her body jerking helplessly as she tried to twist away from his touch.

‚ÄúStop! Stop! Please!‚Äù she begged, her laughter bordering on hysterical.

Gerald didn‚Äôt stop. He worked his way up to her underarms, his fingers wiggling against the sensitive skin. Nadia shrieked, her laughter turning into gasping sobs as she thrashed in the chair.

Noah couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù he shouted, standing up.

Gerald paused, glancing at Noah with an arched eyebrow. ‚ÄúEnough? I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve quite reached her limits yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt take any more,‚Äù Noah insisted, his voice shaking.

Gerald straightened, turning to face Noah with an icy, unamused expression. ‚ÄúYou seem to forget, Noah, that I‚Äôm in control here.‚Äù His voice was calm but laced with quiet menace. ‚ÄúI set the terms. You agreed to them.‚Äù

Noah‚Äôs heart sank. He felt the weight of Gerald‚Äôs words, the unspoken reminder of what was at stake. Nadia was staring at him now, her tear-filled eyes silently begging him to do something. But what could he do?

Gerald adjusted the cuffs around his sleeves, his composure unshaken. ‚ÄúNadia has been a fascinating subject so far, but I‚Äôd like to see just how far her limits truly go. And I assure you,‚Äù he said, his smirk widening, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even begun to get creative.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, please,‚Äù Nadia whimpered, her voice hoarse from laughter and exhaustion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm begging you. I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt take any more!‚Äù

Gerald ignored her protests, moving back in front of her. He knelt by her feet again, his sharp eyes inspecting her trembling soles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done well so far,‚Äù he said, as though offering her a twisted compliment. ‚ÄúBut I think we can push a little further.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I can‚Äôt‚Äîplease, don‚Äôt!‚Äù Nadia pleaded, her voice breaking. She tried to pull her feet back, but the restraints held firm.

Gerald reached into his pocket and pulled out another tool: a small, electric toothbrush. The faint hum as he turned it on sent a shiver of dread through Nadia.

‚ÄúNo! Not that!‚Äù she cried, struggling against the chair. ‚ÄúPlease, not that!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, the beauty of this tool,‚Äù Gerald said, running the vibrating brush along the edge of her right sole, ‚Äúis that it targets even the tiniest nerve endings. A much more‚Ä¶precise instrument.‚Äù

The moment the bristles made contact with the ball of her foot, Nadia let out an ear-piercing shriek. Laughter exploded from her lips, raw and uncontrollable, as she thrashed in the chair.

‚ÄúStop it! Stop! Please!‚Äù she screamed, her voice cracking.

Gerald remained unfazed, methodically dragging the toothbrush across her foot in small, deliberate circles. He focused on the spots just beneath her toes, the delicate skin of her arches, and the center of her heel, each movement extracting more frantic laughter and desperate pleas from her.

‚ÄúYour reactions are remarkable,‚Äù Gerald said, his tone almost admiring. ‚ÄúThis level of sensitivity is quite rare.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop! I can‚Äôt‚Äîno, not there!‚Äù Nadia wailed as Gerald shifted the toothbrush to her left foot. He alternated between using the bristles on her sole and wedging them between her toes, the vibrations driving her to the brink of hysteria.

Her laughter turned into gasping sobs as she struggled to catch her breath. ‚ÄúPlease, please, I can‚Äôt take it anymore!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing wonderfully,‚Äù Gerald said, completely ignoring her pleas. He continued to switch between techniques, sometimes using the toothbrush, sometimes his fingers, keeping her off balance and unable to predict his next move.

From the couch, Noah watched helplessly, his stomach churning. He wanted to scream, to demand that Gerald stop, but the fear of losing his job‚Äîand the powerlessness of the situation‚Äîkept him rooted to the spot.

After what felt like an eternity, Gerald finally set the toothbrush aside. Nadia slumped in the chair, her face red and streaked with tears. Her chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath, her body trembling with exhaustion.

But Gerald wasn‚Äôt done.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, standing and moving behind her, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs return to your upper body. We‚Äôve barely scratched the surface there.‚Äù

Nadia‚Äôs head snapped up, her eyes wide with terror. ‚ÄúNo! No, please, not again! I can‚Äôt‚ÄîI can‚Äôt take it!‚Äù

Gerald leaned down, his voice low and calm in her ear. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll take what I give you.‚Äù

He placed his hands on her ribs, his fingers lightly grazing the spaces between the bones. Nadia flinched at the touch, shaking her head frantically.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äîdon‚Äôt do this!‚Äù she begged, her voice trembling.

But Gerald‚Äôs fingers were already moving, kneading her ribs with slow, deliberate precision. Nadia‚Äôs laughter erupted again, high-pitched and desperate as she twisted in the chair, her body jerking against the restraints.

‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù Gerald said, his voice calm despite the chaos of her reactions. ‚ÄúThe ribs are an excellent target. So many sensitive nerves, so many opportunities for exploration.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease! Stop! I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt breathe!‚Äù Nadia gasped, her laughter mingling with sobs.

Gerald‚Äôs hands moved upward, digging gently into the soft hollows beneath her arms. Nadia let out a shriek, her laughter taking on a panicked, hysterical edge as she thrashed wildly.

‚ÄúSuch a strong reaction,‚Äù Gerald remarked, his fingers wiggling relentlessly. ‚ÄúThis is truly fascinating.‚Äù

Nadia‚Äôs voice cracked as she screamed through her laughter, her entire body shaking with the effort to escape his touch. ‚ÄúNo! No more! Please!‚Äù

Gerald didn‚Äôt stop. He alternated between her underarms, her ribs, and her sides, constantly varying the pressure and speed of his movements. He seemed to take perverse satisfaction in her helplessness, pushing her closer and closer to her breaking point.

‚ÄúRemarkable stamina,‚Äù he said, his voice almost clinical. ‚ÄúMost people would have given up by now.‚Äù

From the couch, Noah could hardly bear to watch. He wanted to do something‚Äîanything‚Äîbut the weight of Gerald‚Äôs power over him kept him frozen.

Finally, after what felt like hours, Gerald stepped back. Nadia slumped forward in the chair, her body trembling as she gasped for air. Her hair was plastered to her forehead with sweat, and her voice was hoarse from screaming.

‚ÄúThat will do for today,‚Äù Gerald said, his tone casual, as though he had just finished a routine task.

He began to unfasten her restraints, his movements slow and deliberate. Nadia didn‚Äôt speak‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt even look at him. Her shoulders shook as she tried to steady her breathing, her face flushed with humiliation and exhaustion.

Gerald turned to Noah, his expression calm but smug. ‚ÄúI trust this won‚Äôt be an issue again, Noah. Your job is safe, provided you continue to meet my expectations.‚Äù

Noah clenched his fists, his jaw tight. He hated Gerald in that moment‚Äîhated the smug satisfaction in his eyes, the way he had reduced Nadia to this state. But all he could do was nod.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Gerald said, a satisfied smirk on his face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre free to go.‚Äù

Noah helped Nadia to her feet, supporting her as she leaned heavily against him. She didn‚Äôt say a word as they walked to the door, her body still trembling.

As they left, Gerald‚Äôs voice followed them. ‚ÄúOh, and Noah? Do try to be on time from now on.‚Äù

Noah didn‚Äôt respond. He just held his wife close, his heart heavy with guilt and anger as they walked out into the night.",1,1744533651.0,ticklingstories,0,1.0,False

I'm creating a Coffee Ordering app. It worked pretty good before the point, where I needed to send all the info to the orders.db. By all the info I mean: Ordered Items (Is it Drink or Coffee (have to distinguish them)) and which addons each ordered element has.

Here came the problem. Originally I've created List<Items> and List<AddOns>, but then understood It had no connection between them whatsoever. So I've decided to add OrderedItem and OrderedAddOn classes. So rn my files look like this:

1. Item.cs

    public class Item
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public double? Price { get; set; }
       
    // public bool Type { get; set; } //If true is Coffee, if false is Drink
          
    private int? _quantity;
           public int Quantity 
       {
           get => _quantity ?? 1; 
           set => _quantity = value;

    }

    {
        public int? Shit { get; set; }

To be honest, I dont really get how the AutoMapper or Manual Mapper work, so maybe that's why I get the troubles. (I mean I've modified the classes and now migrations do not work even in the Item class) Before this everything worked smoothly and saved the info the right way. That's why (maybe its also relevant) ill add a bit of info how my ui worked:

I was just saving the list of items, that were selected. Then via that list it was shown, which addons could be added, for each selected element. But after that, im stuck.

Maybe there's another solution to send all of the data to an orders.db? ",0,1744533450.0,csharp,5,0.5,False

Surprisingly is mostly stayed around 130lbs. 

My highest weight was 150 and then I sunk into a Ed due to my mom mentioning my weight so often.

I recovered by myself(no one but a few people knew) and I was then 125lbs

Now I'm 19 and I'm 140lbs. 


So my diet is that I have a coffee at 8am in the morning and then dinner around 3pm and then I do now and again snacking. And around 11pm I eat a small meal. That's on weekdays

On weekends I only eat dinner. And then do little snacks after.

But this issue is that Im Not hungry during the day. I'm so hungry at night it's unbearable. I can't sleep. It's so hard to ignore. 

I borderline gorge before bed because I can't go to sleep hungry. Because I won't sleep.

I eat under 1100 calories a day, Im Not exactly active, and I'm 5ft.

I have no appetite during the day and don't get hungry at all but at night I feel starved.

I'm trying to get better and lose weight.

Any advice would be great.

It was a cozy place, all exposed brick and mismatched armchairs, a far cry from my usual sterile, modern haunt. I approached the counter, ready to order my usual black coffee, when the woman behind it looked up and beamed.

‚ÄúHey, Liam! Long time no see! The usual?‚Äù

My name. How did she know my name? I‚Äôd never seen her before in my life. She was petite, with vibrant purple hair pulled back in a messy bun and a constellation of silver rings adorning her fingers.

‚ÄúUh, hi,‚Äù I said, a knot of confusion tightening in my stomach. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve met. How do you know my name?‚Äù

Her smile faltered, replaced by a look of genuine surprise. ‚ÄúLiam, it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ all of us. You know?‚Äù She gestured vaguely around the empty shop. ‚ÄúEveryone knows.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process her words. ‚ÄúEveryone knows what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre you,‚Äù she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all you, Liam. How could you forget?‚Äù

I laughed, a nervous, incredulous sound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

She just tilted her head, her purple strands catching the soft morning light. ‚ÄúIs it? Think about it. Doesn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶ feel right?‚Äù

I glanced at another employee, a young man wiping down the counter. ‚ÄúHey, do you know who I am?‚Äù I asked him.

He looked up, a serene smile on his face. ‚ÄúOf course, Liam. We all do. We‚Äôre all you.‚Äù

I paid for my coffee, my hands trembling slightly, and practically fled the shop. The coffee tasted bitter, like ash in my mouth. The walk to work was a blur of bewildered thoughts. Had I gone crazy? Was this some elaborate prank?

I burst into my boss, Mr. Henderson‚Äôs, office, ready to share the bizarre encounter, expecting a shared laugh at some quirky barista. ‚ÄúMr. Henderson, you won‚Äôt believe what just happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked up from his paperwork, a warm smile spreading across his face. ‚ÄúAh, Liam. Good morning. Did you sleep well? You seemed a little‚Ä¶ out of it yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOut of it? No, I‚Ä¶ I went to this new coffee shop, and the woman there, she knew my name, and she said‚Ä¶ she said she was me. And the other employee too! They all said they were me!‚Äù I waited for the punchline, the shared amusement.

Mr. Henderson‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúWell, of course, Liam. We all are. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fundamental, isn‚Äôt it? Surprised you‚Äôre just realizing it now.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. He wasn‚Äôt joking. He genuinely believed it.

The day crawled by, each interaction a surreal echo of the morning. My colleagues greeted me with knowing smiles, their eyes holding an unsettling familiarity. Every conversation circled back to the same baffling truth: they were me.

That evening, fueled by a desperate need for answers, for escape, I booked a last-minute flight. If this was some localized madness, a shared delusion, then surely a change of scenery would break the spell. I liquidated my savings, the numbers on the screen feeling strangely insignificant, and boarded a plane to London.

Stepping onto the cobbled streets of London felt like entering another world, yet the feeling of wrongness persisted. The customs officer who checked my passport greeted me by name, a conspiratorial wink in his eye. The taxi driver launched into a conversation about my preferences, things no stranger could possibly know.

In a dimly lit pub, nursing a pint of ale, I found myself drawn to an elderly woman sitting alone in a corner. Her eyes were sharp and unsettlingly knowing. I took a deep breath and told her my story, the words tumbling out in a desperate rush.

She listened patiently, her gaze unwavering. When I finished, she nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre finally waking up, are you?‚Äù Her voice was raspy, like dry leaves rustling.

‚ÄúWaking up to what?‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, but it is, dear boy,‚Äù she said, her lips curving into a faint, unsettling smile. ‚ÄúYou are the only real consciousness in this universe. Everyone else‚Ä¶ we are all constructs. Projections of your mind, existing solely for you to perceive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs insane,‚Äù I whispered, the ale suddenly turning sour in my stomach.

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù she countered. ‚ÄúThink about it. Have you ever truly known the inner thoughts of another? Felt their independent existence as vividly as your own? We are reflections, Liam. Echoes in your grand, solitary play.‚Äù

The implications were staggering, terrifying. If I was the only real person‚Ä¶ then nothing else truly mattered.

Shaken to my core, I stumbled out of the pub and into a rental car. My thoughts were a chaotic storm. The rain slicked the unfamiliar roads, the headlights cutting through the darkness. Distracted, lost in the horrifying reality of my solipsistic existence, I didn‚Äôt see the pedestrian until it was too late.

The sickening thud, the screech of tires, the horrifying realization of what I had done. I scrambled out of the car, my heart pounding in my chest. A young man lay motionless on the wet asphalt.

Sirens wailed in the distance. When the police arrived, their faces were grim. But as they approached me, their expressions softened with recognition.

‚ÄúLiam,‚Äù one of them said, his voice surprisingly gentle. ‚ÄúTerrible accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I killed him,‚Äù I stammered, pointing at the lifeless figure. ‚ÄúYou have to arrest me.‚Äù

The officer exchanged a look with his partner. ‚ÄúArrest you, Liam? But‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre you. Why would we arrest ourselves?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me. There were no consequences. Nothing mattered.

The next few weeks were a descent into a terrifying freedom. I walked into banks, demanding money, my face uncovered. The tellers smiled sadly and handed over the cash. The police who arrived simply shook their heads and let me walk away.

The moral compass that had guided my life shattered. If no one else was truly real, what did it matter what I did? I started small, petty thefts, but the lack of consequence was a chilling invitation.

Soon, petty theft wasn‚Äôt enough. I wanted to test the limits, to see just how far this terrifying reality extended. I committed murder. The act was brutal, gruesome, and the faces of the victims‚Ä¶ they were my own, contorted in fear and pain. The police arrived, saw me, and simply turned away.

The weight of my actions, or rather the lack thereof, was crushing. The world had become a grotesque stage play, populated by my own unfeeling projections. I was a monster in a world of mirrors.

Finally, a bleak and terrifying thought took root. What would happen if I ceased to perceive? What would happen if I ended my own consciousness?

In a dingy hotel room, overlooking the indifferent cityscape of London, I made the irreversible decision. The world around me swam, the faces of the countless ‚Äúme‚Äùs I had encountered flashing before my eyes. Then, darkness.

But it wasn‚Äôt the end.

I gasped, jolting awake in a sweat-soaked bed. The air was thick with the smell of dust and something vaguely floral. The room was dimly lit by the soft glow of a gas lamp. The wallpaper was patterned with faded roses.

Disoriented, I sat up and looked around. This wasn‚Äôt my London hotel room. This wasn‚Äôt even my apartment back home. The furniture was antique, heavy and ornate. Through the window, I could see a dusty street lined with horse-drawn carriages and people in long skirts and bowler hats.

A woman entered the room, her hair piled high in elaborate curls. She smiled warmly. ‚ÄúGood morning, darlin‚Äô. Slept well?‚Äù Her accent was thick, Southern.

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where am I?‚Äù I stammered.

‚ÄúWhy, you‚Äôre in Galveston, Texas, sugar. It‚Äôs 1925. You don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù

I stared at her, my mind reeling. Texas? 1925? This had to be another dream, another facet of the solipsistic nightmare.

But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, a strange sense of normalcy began to settle in. The people I met had their own distinct personalities, their own inner lives that felt undeniably real. They argued, they laughed, they grieved. They didn‚Äôt look at me with that unsettling knowingness. They didn‚Äôt say they were me.

The world felt solid again, the consequences of actions tangible. I got a job, made friends, even started to fall in love. The horror of London, the terrifying realization of solipsism, felt like a distant, fading nightmare.

Had I truly woken up? Was this another layer of the dream? Or had the universe, in its infinite branches, finally offered me an escape from the suffocating prison of my own mind? I didn‚Äôt know. But for the first time in a long time, I felt a flicker of hope. And in 1920s Texas, I began to live again, cautiously, tentatively, in a world that finally felt like it existed beyond the confines of my own consciousness.",1,1744532756.0,u_Best-Bonus-4525,0,1.0,False

E olha que n√£o foi nenhuma est√≥ria de amor n√≠vel com√©dia rom√¢ntica, muito pelo contr√°rio. H√° uns a os eu era um adolescente gordinho e desajeitado, tinha alguns amigos por pena e ningu√©m queria me pegar, resumo da √≥pera, sumi, fui √† academia, li, obtive v√°rios hobbies e fiquei impressionantemente bonito -palavra de terceiros, n√£o minhas. Nesse grupo havia uma mina que me chamou sempre aten√ß√£o, vamos chama-l√° de Coffee -piada interna minha e dela. Ela nunca tinha tido interesse em mim quando eu era gordinho e esquisito, mas quando mudei um pouco ela me deu um pouco de abertura e ficamos algumas vezes. Foi o suficiente pra eu colocar pra fora aquela paix√£o que tinha por ela, vejam bem, ela n√£o era exatamente uma deusa grega com corpo escultural, era uma menina comum que vemos no dia a dia, mas tinha algo nela que fazia n√£o s√≥ eu, como v√°rios caras fascinados, pra mim eram os olhos. 

Pra resumir bem, ela n√£o tinha interesse em nada s√©rio comigo, come√ßou a namorar um amigo meu na √©poca n√£o t√£o pr√≥ximo, o que me magoou muito na √©poca.

Temho novidades da vida dela √†s vezes, como agora em que ela est√° cursando medicina, e eu sei que era o sonho dela, e fico feliz demais, mesmo que ela n√£o ligue pra mim, sei que n√£o foi nada importante pra ela, mas fodase, eu amei genuinamente e fico feliz por ter tido essa sensa√ß√£o mesmo que n√£o tenha sido da forma que queria.

I have managed to get out of a depressed and bedridden state for months and start to slowly go back to work and do more things like spend time with my family and eat out after adopting these. I still suffer from high HR, jitters and tremors, poor sleep with adrenaline rushes , fatigue, headaches and constant dizziness and vertigo but they‚Äôre more manageable now and hopefully will go away over time.. 


1. First thing was journaling every single symptom and medication and side effect I‚Äôve experienced since day 1 . This helped me narrow down potential triggers and note effectiveness of different medication. 

2. I did a drug holiday to see what were my real symptoms and not get confused with side effects of various medication. Doc told me it would take 4 days to flush out all effects of ongoing medication and from there I figured out what issues I had to resolve 

3. Being bedridden made my body even weaker and so I forced myself to get out of the house every night or evening just to walk 5-10mins around my home before increasing it to heading out to get food and groceries etc after two weeks . 

4. Started doing supine exercises. You can search pots exercise on YouTube and I‚Äôve been mainly focusing on legs and core muscles to increase their ability to push blood flow. Exercise is super important I felt so much better a week after starting to move around . Before that, I was so weak and down and useless felt like I was truly going to die. 

5. I started on stress relief supplements and Magnesium and b12 daily with meals. I also force myself to take small bites every few hours even without an appetite to build up the appetite and decrease potential blood sugar spikes. Im not sure of the effectiveness of supplements but research said it does help with neurological and blood circulations

6. Listening to meditation and hypnosis to sleep using noise cancelling earphones. They usually include breathing exercises. Blue light glasses for a few dollars off the internet . This sets me in the mood for sleeping an hour prior.

7. Hobbies to do in bed on bad days. I‚Äôve gotten colouring books, sudoku and jigsaw puzzles to calm myself in the evenings before bed and unwind . 

8. Vertigo eye exercises from YouTube helped me a lot with my walking imbalance and vertigo. 

9. Realising and acknowledging that I do have anxiety. I am undiagnosed but I realised being worried about my health has triggered a constant fear in my head. Once I realised some symptoms were due to anxiety I managed to calm myself using guided YouTube breathing exercises and managed to calm my jitters and tremors a lot. Also things took a turn for the better once I started being more positive and accepting of my condition and focusing my energy and mind on recovery steps .

10. YouTube has been my best friend. Lots of channels of recovery stories of people with pots and cfs for years and managed to get out of it ! I love watching guides to recovery and even breakdown of explanations of various symptoms. 

11. Air humidifier helps me keep my hydration throughout my sleep. Drinking water and rehydration salts all the time. Tea, honey, coffee and chocolate used to set me off and so I‚Äôm staying off them

12. Remember that you won‚Äôt wake up one day and feel normal again but one day you‚Äôll wake up and think about one month ago and realise how far you‚Äôll come and eventually you‚Äôll get there. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but that‚Äôs all I can think of for now. I hope this posts encourages some of you to channel your energy to recovery.  ",1,1744532617.0,POTS,0,0.99,False

If you dont have any plans for today, maybe we could get together in a cafe somewhere, talk about whatever, and cap it all off with a make out session in my car? 

I can drive and pick you up and drop you back off naman if we do decide to go somewhere so the world (metro manila) is our oyster. Oh, and coffee's on me!

There are a number of studies/polls and you can also see quite clearly in the media in recent years that there‚Äôs a surge in talking about Christianity or at least spiritual/philosophical topics. 

I wanted to gauge interest if people would like to meet up and talk/discuss openly about things like where do we find satisfaction or meaning in life, where do we find hope, how do we think about evil and suffering - potentially hearing the Christian point of view but with a forum for people to engage, question, speak about those ideas. We could do it over a coffee or small meal‚Ä¶or whatever, it can be chill. 

If you would not be interested or that in fact is something you would not like to happen, I‚Äôd equally love to hear your objections. 

I live in Shanklin so if I started something I‚Äôd love to do it there but open for different venues. 

Thank you for your thoughts. ",0,1744532497.0,isleofwight,12,0.25,False
1jy2x4k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jy2x4k,Help me decide on breakfast bar layout! üôè,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm trying to decide between two possible setups for a small breakfast bar area and would love your thoughts.

**Option 1 (as per photos)**: A 60x60x60 ""cube"" space in the microwave/oven tower. Oven goes below, microwave above, both in white. I'd place the coffee machine, toaster and kettle on a bench-like surface inside and the wood around it. It would stay open at the front (I looked into a roll-up door but it was too pricey). Since it's not directly in the cooking zone, it already feels fairly tidy.

**Option 2**: Put the breakfast bar where the pantry currently goes. So storage above and below, this way the breakfast bar would be less visible. It‚Äôs also near the peninsula, which makes sense. I initially liked this better, but my partner prefers a full-height pantry for more visible storage. I‚Äôm okay with drawers under the peninsula‚Äîeasier to pull out and see what‚Äôs inside but he still finds top-down storage trickier.

There‚Äôs also a **hybrid idea**: option 2 and then keep the oven low and add two drawers above for storage (where breakfast bar goes in option 1), but it‚Äôd only be 60cm tall (worth it?) and I‚Äôm unsure about having the oven that low (even though we don‚Äôt use it much).

Thanks so much for reading! Any advice or ideas are super appreciated üòä",1,1744532384.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False
