Feel free to add your own drinking method.

  
**I'm 61 and been drinking coffee since around...6 yrs old! :D**  


My grandmother would make me coffee with milk and sugar, later, I was introduced to coffee with evaporated milk and sugar, very delicious.  


As I grew older, I would drink coffee with milk and sugar, like a Cuban cortadito so, the coffee brewed was mainly espresso.  


In later life, I've transitioned from making coffee espresso like, brewed from a kettle, to  a Keurig, with zero sugar creamer.  


Since I've discovered the Nespresso system, I'm in love with the crema it makes, and the more refined taste.  


Been thinking about switching to no creamer, no sugar, and just brew the pod and drinking it straight up.

I’ve been living in LA for a couple of years now (originally from France), and I’ve been really curious about how LA’s beauty culture influences the way people experience different parts of the city. What are your toughts about it? 

Before I came here, I thought of LA as this body-positive place, but also one where beauty standards are really demanding, especially when it comes to how we’re expected to look in different neighborhoods.

I’m a PhD student looking into how this beauty culture affects the way people move through and interact with different spaces in LA. As part of my research, I’m doing some fun, casual interviews where we mix a little mapping game with a discussion about beauty culture in the city.

For the game, I’ll show you a few images of beauty representations (like billboards, shop windows, and murals) and ask you to guess where in LA they were taken. It’s a fun way to talk about how beauty is spread across the city and how it affects our daily experiences in different neighborhoods.

I’m looking for people who’d be up for a laid-back chat over coffee to share their thoughts on beauty culture in LA and how it shapes the way they experience different areas of the city.

Her and I haven’t had the best of a relationship at the moment because of her friend. We shall call her friend Barbra. I get my mom has the right to friends but Barbra is a bad apple!! They met during bingo 20 years ago. But at the years went by Barbra started to go to my parents house in the afternoon and not leave til  1-2 in the morning.  My dad brought the topic up and my mom blew him off. Then my mom fell into helping Barbra with a scam. I told my mom it was a scam and she blew me off. Then my mom started treating me like crap. When my son was younger I invited my mom to one of her grandchildren’s choir concert. She was there for a whole 10 mins. She got a text from Barbra and made up a lie to leave before the concert started. Broke my child’s heart. I confronted her and my mom said”oh it was your dad.” Me being who I am I called her out on her lie. Few more years down the road Barbra had her leg amputated from the knee down. And yet my mom was being used to take her places and do things for her while her ex husband was living in her apartment. I told my mom my thoughts and my mom blew me off yet again, even my dad told my mom about her friend. Last month I called my mom to see how she was doing. She became really rude and disrespectful to me so I told her I would leave her be. She took that out of context and started telling my business to other people and Barbra! Barbra is like a gossip tabloid. The other day I reached out to my mom and yet more disrespect. It got to the point she threw my spouses parents in the mix. So I confronted her on how she treats me when she hangs around Barbra and my mom said I don’t talk or hang with Barbra. Well my children and I lost a friend that was like family to us. I was at work I called my mom to have her to go to my house to check on my children ages now 18 & 15. She didn’t answer so I called my parents home phone and my dad busted my mom out by telling me “ you’re mom went to Barbra’s house” Mind you it’s 10:30-11:00 at night. I said ok. So I sat and stewed on it. Then I went over to my parents house like I usually did on the nights I work to have coffee and chit chat. My mom was stand offish. Then her phone keeping going off because she was getting Facebook messages. I said it’s ok I know you’re talking to Barbra. She said “ no it’s our coworker” and she gave me said name. I just looked at her and said” do I look stupid to you.” As she put her phone down facedown on the table which she never does. So I just told my mom”I can’t do the lies anymore you’ve been lying about a lot and I’m not the one to be lying to. I don’t like liars” I’m blunt and honest to people even it hurts their feelings. So my mom went around calling everyone she knows and talking to Barbra about what’s going on. I reached out again and asked my mom to please stop talking about me. She said she wasn’t. Well then how the hell is all these people know what’s going on? She said she didn’t know. So I said you know what until you can tell the truth and be honest to people then I’ll leave you alone.

David has been so apprehensive with dealing with Israel because at the start of the conflict, he began losing listeners/viewers who were pro Hamas. He now avoids talking about it altogether. He avoids bringing up culture war issues like trans ideology and the rabid obsession with identity politics. He said on the Iced Coffee Hour podcast (think I’ve got the name right) around a year ago that Biden’s cognitive ability was a concern for him yet never once covered it as a concern on his own show. 

Bryan Tyler Cohen is the same. I watched him the other day and he proudly stated that he had never did a single video on the trans issue. He was saying this to exemplify that it’s not a big issue otherwise he would have covered it. 

As Sam points out, not covering it and failing to deal with head on cost Harris millions of votes. It doesn’t matter if Bryan Tyler Cohen didn’t see it as a big issue; voters did.

Disclaimer: this is not transphobic. Treat everyone with dignity and respect but at the same time don’t put anyone up on a pedestal because of an immutable characteristic. Deal in common sense on every issue. Deal in reality.

1gp7ukx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gp7ukx/something_thats_helping_me_to_think_about/,Something that’s helping me to think about.,"TLDR at the bottom

Hey guys and gals, I had a good day for the first time in a while. I hope you did too, if not that’s okay too. You can try again tomorrow. 

This isn’t really advice, I’m not completely sure what type of writing this is. I just think that if I read something like this it could have helped me so I am getting it out there. 

One of the things that I consistently torture myself with is remembering the good times. Wondering what was actually bad about them, trying to find mine/their faults in it. Making it grey in my memory. Like their lack from my life now makes that memory tainted. What once was happy, is now gone and ruined.

Today I got a slideshow notification from google photos, it was a trip we had gone on. In a mix of self hatred and curiosity at what the similarities between the photos was and how it was being created, I’m a nerd who likes algorithms sue me, I opened it. There I was, happy and smiling. In a place I had never been and most likely won’t return to. Taking it all in. 

At the time everything still was very new, we didn’t know each other as well as we do now that we ran our course. She didn’t know my birthday. I didn’t know her favorite flowers. She didn’t know about how I got the scar on my knee. I didn’t know about the small coffee shop in her hometown she escapes to get away from things. There we were, now here we are. 

I expected to feel the rush of all of it. That feeling that I’m dumb, that I could have seen this coming. That I can find the clues to whatever was wrong with us. That if I zoom in on just the right spot I’ll see something that puts it all into perspective. So I took a second, stared at the play button and hit it. 

There it all was, as I had seen it when I was there. Not how I see it now. I saw myself taking the pictures, feeling the way that I felt at the time. It was oddly comforting. To feel an appreciation for what I’ve done, not where I am. I just remembered what I did. All of a sudden I didn’t mind looking back. Seeing myself being an idiot in so many ways at once. I was happy, I’m happy that I did what I did. I wouldn’t trade it for anything, all of it is worth it.

All the pain, all those sleepless nights, all of the times I had to say no when one of our friends asked if we were together. I had to do all of these things, and they weren’t fun.

But I would still do it every single time. Even when it was bad, I was living. I was experiencing things I never would have without it, and if that’s all it ever meant at the end of the day. I think I can live with that.

TLDR- Don’t ruminate on the past. Appreciate it for what you can, learn what will help you, and go experience more. It’s going to be okay.",2,1731371194.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I found this community and hope this is a place where I can vent my frustrations and talk to others dealing with similar experiences. I’ll start by sharing my journey from diagnosis I suppose.

I never thought I’d get GERD. I’ve have been eating very freely throughout my life. The first instance happened in college. One day after eating 3-4 slices of pizza and drinking soda, I felt a little uneasy in my throat and stomach. I tried falling asleep that night but couldn’t. The nausea kicked in afterwards. I started dry heaving in the middle of the night so my parents drove me to the hospital. They hospital did some tests, blood work, X-ray to see if I had anything in my throat, MRI. They also checked visually to see if I had anything wrong in my throat. I was told I was perfectly fine and it was probably acid reflux. At the time I thought they must have missed something. This nausea felt debilitating. I foolishly almost wished it was something more serious as opposed to accepting that something like my own stomach was causing me to be completely dysfunctional. I went home after the nausea subsided 50%. And went to sleep.

The next few days I had no appetite. I couldn’t eat at all without feeling a little nauseous, which made me not want to eat. Over time there was always a lump feeling in my throat. Slowly this feeling disappeared over the course of a couple weeks.

I then went to some other doctors describing my experiences, they too assumed it was GERD. I went to a GI and did multiple upper endoscopies. The first one was to see if there’s anything else abnormal, and the second was a few months after, to see if the prescribed PPIs worked. 

Both endoscopies came out with normal results, nothing remarkable except the usual GERD symptoms. My GI said she can keep prescribing the PPIs for me if they will make me feel better.

I decided on a different approach. I didn’t want to be taking the meds for my entire life if I didn’t have to. I tried changing my diet. I cut out soda, a lot of fried foods, citrus fruits. I still maintained my daily cup of coffee. I stopped going to bed right after a late dinner. Started eating earlier and giving my stomach 3-4 hours to digest. I started eating smaller meals.

There were times where the GERD would flair up but it would subside after a couple days. I believed my lifestyle change had worked for the most part. 

For the past 6-9 months, I hadn’t had any significant debilitating symptoms from GERD. I almost forgot that one night when I went to the ER.

Until today, which brings me to the progression of my GERD symptoms. Yesterday, I ate a big breakfast with family, and drank one more cup of coffee than I usually do. I went and got a haircut afterwards and lied down as they washed my hair. The wash couldn’t have been longer than 5 mins.

5 mins. That’s all it took.

Afterwards I felt a small lump in my chest, above my sternum. I bought some water to try and wash it down. It subsided for the day but throughout I felt a bit uneasy, on edge.

Then today happened. I woke up feeling mostly fine, ate an average breakfast, but around noon time, I felt very uneasy. It almost felt like an impending doom was coming. I felt mentally on edge but physically I didn’t know what was going on. I thought I was having an anxiety or panic attack. I tried breathing but it felt like I wasn’t getting enough oxygen. I also noticed I lost all my appetite  and couldn’t eat. The nausea kicked in during this evening. I didn’t eat much if anything today. I came extremely close to vomiting twice. Right now I’m feeling waves of nausea, I’m a little bloated despite not eating much, and I feel like any stimuli will send me to the toilet to vomit.

Anyway, that’s it. Any words of advice, criticism for my carelessness, or verbal support is appreciated. Thank you for allowing me to share my experience.",1,1731370638.0,GERD,0,0.67,False

**Bob’s Java Jive: A Coffee Pot of Nostalgia ☕**

You can’t talk about Tacoma without talking about Bob’s Java Jive. This iconic coffee shop, shaped like a giant coffee pot, is a true local treasure. Built in 1927, it’s been a breakfast spot, a drive-in diner, and even a speakeasy during Prohibition. But it wasn’t until 1955 when Bob Radonich and his wife, Lylabell, purchased the establishment and rebranded it as Bob’s Java Jive that it truly became a legend. The name was inspired by the lyrics of a 1950s song by the Ink Spots: “I love coffee; I love tea. I love the java jive, and it loves me.” I always find myself humming that song whenever I step into Bob’s Java Jive. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and full of character, just like the locals I’ve met in Tacoma.  I remember the first time I visited Bob’s Java Jive. I was new to the city, and I was feeling a bit lost. I walked into the coffee shop, and I immediately felt at home. I ordered a coffee, and the barista, who I later learned was named Bob, told me all about the history of the place. I learned that Bob’s Java Jive had been featured in several movies, including “I Love You to Death” with Keanu Reeves.  It felt like the start of a great story, much like my own journey to the United States. 

**The Dune Peninsula: A Sanctuary of Redemption 🏞️**

Tacoma’s waterfront is stunning, but one of my favorite spots is the Dune Peninsula within Point Defiance Park. It’s a place of rebirth and resilience. The land was once home to the ASARCO lead-and-copper smelter, a source of pollution for decades. But through a massive environmental project, the 11 acres of industrial ruins were transformed into a beautiful public park. It’s a testament to the human spirit and our ability to overcome adversity.  The park’s distinctive features include three large, sculpted landforms known as “sail mounds,” offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.  It’s a peaceful haven where you can reflect on the past and look forward to the future.  I think about my own journey to the United States.  The hardships and challenges I faced were like the pollution that once plagued the Dune Peninsula.  But like the peninsula, I found strength and beauty in overcoming adversity. 

**Thornewood Castle: A Gothic Tale 🏰**

Thornewood Castle is a unique piece of history, and let’s face it, a bit of a mystery. This Tudor Gothic castle was built in 1909-1911 using pieces from a 400-year-old English castle!  It was quite a feat, and it’s a reminder that the past can be brought into the present, much like I brought my Filipino culture to the United States.  The castle has a haunted reputation, having been featured in Stephen King’s “Rose Red” and its sequel “The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer.”  I love a good mystery, and Thornewood Castle has that in spades.  There’s something magical about the castle, and I often wonder what stories are hidden within its walls. It’s a place that sparks my imagination.  

**Point Defiance Slides: A Reminder of Childhood Joy 🤸‍♀️**

I can’t resist a good slide, and the Point Defiance Slides are a treat. These six slides, ranging in length, descend a 60-foot slope from the Wilson Way Bridge to the marina complex below. It’s a reminder of childhood joy and the simple pleasures of life. The slides are a reminder to never take ourselves too seriously and to always find time for a little fun. As a software engineer, I often find myself working long hours.  But I know that it’s important to find time to play, just like when I was a kid.  The Point Defiance Slides are a great way to do that.

**Brown & Haley Outlet: A Sweet Trip Down Memory Lane 🍭**

This quirky building, a relic of the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair, is now a candy outlet for Brown & Haley, the makers of Almond Roca.  It’s a reminder that even the most unusual of places can hold a sweet history. It’s like a time capsule, transporting you back to a different era. I’m a big fan of Almond Roca, and I always enjoy stopping by the Brown & Haley Outlet. It’s a bit of a nostalgic trip, a reminder of simpler times. I think about my childhood in the Philippines, where the streets were filled with the sounds of laughter and the smell of sweet treats.  It’s a feeling I find in the Brown & Haley Outlet.

**The Hobbit House: A Portal to Fantasy 🏡**

The Hobbit House in Port Orchard is a truly whimsical creation. Built in 2015, it’s inspired by the hobbit houses from J. R. R. Tolkien’s fantasy novels. Stepping into the house, you feel like you’ve entered a different world. It’s a reminder that our imaginations can take us anywhere, even to the enchanted realms of Middle-earth. I’m a big fan of fantasy, and I love the Hobbit House for its creativity and charm. It’s a place where I can escape from the everyday world and immerse myself in a world of imagination. It’s the same feeling I get when I’m writing code.  I can create anything I can imagine, and it’s a feeling that never gets old.

Tacoma is full of these hidden gems, waiting to be discovered.  It’s a city that reminds me of my own journey – a journey filled with challenges, unexpected twists, and moments of pure joy.  Like Tacoma, I’m a city of surprises, and I’m always excited to see what comes next. 🌠",1,1731370577.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

Sure, there are perks, like no commute and more flexibility, but the downsides are really starting to weigh on me, and I can’t be the only one. Anyone else feeling like maybe going back to the office isn’t such a bad idea?

One of the biggest problems I’ve faced is the lack of real human interaction. Working from home, everything is virtual, and I genuinely miss the casual conversations and spontaneous connections that happen in an office. Virtual meetings just don’t replicate that feeling. Those hallway chats, coffee breaks, and team lunches made a difference in feeling connected, and it’s just not the same behind a screen. For me, it’s made work feel isolating and repetitive.

Then there’s the issue of boundaries—or lack thereof. When my “office” is the same place where I relax, eat, and sleep, it’s way too easy for work to spill into all hours of the day. I find myself checking emails late at night or struggling to disconnect, and it’s starting to feel like I’m always on the clock. In an office, leaving for the day actually meant *leaving* work behind. At home, it all blurs together, and it’s harder to mentally switch off.

Another thing that often gets overlooked is how much easier it is to stay motivated in an office environment. At home, there are endless distractions—household chores, social media, family members, and more. I often find myself procrastinating or struggling to stay focused. In an office, the environment is specifically set up for productivity, and seeing others around you working can be surprisingly motivating.

And let’s talk about professional growth. When you’re working remotely, it’s easy to feel “out of sight, out of mind.” Opportunities for mentorship, networking, or even being noticed for promotions are different. Face-to-face interactions with managers and peers often lead to more spontaneous opportunities, and I feel like some of that is lost when everything is through a screen.

Finally, there’s the tech frustration. If I have a computer issue, I can’t just walk over to IT for a quick fix; instead, I’m stuck troubleshooting on my own, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. And don’t even get me started on endless Zoom fatigue and the strain of staring at screens all day without in-person breaks.

I’m not saying remote work doesn’t have its perks, and I know it’s a dream come true for some people. But for those of us who thrive on social interaction, structure, and boundaries, there’s something to be said for office life. Am I alone here, or is anyone else actually looking forward to being back in an office?",0,1731370554.0,venting,1,0.5,False

It’s like a scene straight out of a movie, except this one is real, and it’s happening right here in my backyard. I felt a little bit of a chill run down my spine, a feeling I’ve gotten many times in my career as a software engineer. I remember all the meetings, the arguments, the endless iterations, and the frustrations that we faced when we were implementing similar technology in large-scale applications at Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. But I also remember the good that came out of it. We built systems that helped people in need, and that’s what this technology is about – helping people. But these activists are saying that ShotSpotter is dangerous. That it leads to “over-policing” in Black communities. I can tell you, as someone who has seen the good that technology can do, that’s just not true. 😥

I’ve spent years working on projects that aimed to make cities safer, and I can tell you that technology like ShotSpotter is a valuable tool for law enforcement. It’s not a magic bullet, but it’s a step in the right direction. It can help police respond to gun violence more quickly and accurately, and it can also help them to identify potential threats before they escalate. And if these activists were truly concerned about the safety of Black communities, they’d support this technology. After all, if something bad happens in a community, it’s the residents of that community who suffer the most. 

I know some people are worried about “over-policing,” and that’s a legitimate concern. But we can’t let fear paralyze us. We need to find ways to use technology responsibly, and to make sure that it’s used to protect all of our communities, not just the ones that are already privileged. That’s why it’s so important that we have a healthy debate about these issues.  

These groups like the Black Panther Party of Washington, the Institute for Black Justice, and Indivisible Tacoma claim to be fighting for social justice. They say that they’re trying to protect Black communities. But I think they’re wrong. They’re actually doing the opposite. They’re fighting against progress, and they’re making our communities less safe. I hope that people will see through their rhetoric and realize that ShotSpotter is a valuable tool that can make our cities safer for everyone. 🌎✊",1,1731370431.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

I've been having some anxiety about my lack of ability now (and for the future) to donate money to the Church. Our Preist brings up giving money often and I feel guilty not doing so. I am a student and unemployed so the most I can usually give is a few dollars. The days I have no money, I don't eat at the coffee hour. Whenever he brings up the topic of money with the whole parish, it really makes me uneasy, and it's rather off-putting (which isn't his fault, but my own problem). I come from a protestant church where the topic of donating was never mentioned. 

I am also worried that when I am baptized (soon to be a Catechumen), that I won't be able to give as much as I should considering all the things I'll be provided with. I've heard a baptismal robe also needs to be rented/purchased once that time comes and this really concerns me.

The church bells chimed softly, weaving through the stillness of the morning. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, painting the congregation in patches of blue, red, and gold. Natalie shifted nervously, her fingers playing with the hem of her dress as she tried to focus on the pastor’s words. But her thoughts were miles away, drawn to Ethan. He sat a few rows ahead, his posture relaxed, head slightly bowed as if completely absorbed in the sermon. The sight made her heart skip—a warmth that felt equal parts joy and trepidation.
How did I get so lucky? The question stirred both delight and doubt.
Three months had passed since they first met. The memory was still vivid, as clear as the light filtering through the windows now. She’d been the new face in the crowd, awkward and unsure, until Ethan had walked over after the service. His smile had been a lifeline, pulling her out of the sea of unfamiliarity. The way he spoke—confident yet genuine—made her feel like she mattered, like she was the only person in the room.
As the service drew to a close, Ethan turned, catching her eye. His smile lit up his face, and a small flutter of anticipation sparked in her chest. He moved through the departing crowd with ease, stopping right before her. “Coffee?” he asked, his voice casual, his eyes searching hers for a response.
Natalie hesitated, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks. Around them, people filtered out of the church, laughter and conversation blending into a low hum. “Sure,” she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.
Their walk to the nearby café felt effortless, laughter punctuating the afternoon air. Ethan had a knack for drawing her out, making her talk about her childhood, her dreams, things she hadn’t shared with anyone in years. He listened with an intensity that made her feel truly seen. When she’d spoken about how much she cherished her independence, he had tilted his head, eyes softening.
“I admire that,” he’d said, and the sincerity in his voice had disarmed her. “It’s rare to find someone who values that kind of strength in themselves.”
Those words had latched onto her heart, rooted deep. It wasn’t just his charm or his smile—it was the way he made her feel strong and valued.
Now, months later, Natalie felt the same pull every time they were together. It was intoxicating, the way Ethan’s attention wrapped around her, both comforting and binding. He held her hand a little tighter than most, laughed a little louder at her jokes, and his gaze... it always found her first in a crowded room. “You’re not going anywhere, right?” he’d tease, laughter in his eyes but something else lingering beneath. She’d laugh it off, reassuring him, ignoring the slight tightening in her chest that came with the question.
As they left the church that day, Ethan’s arm slipped around her waist, firm yet possessive. It was familiar now, his touch. But today, she felt a strange weight to it, a subtle claim that whispered mine in a way that made her heart quicken—not entirely out of excitement.
“Maybe we could spend more time together this week,” Ethan said, his tone as light as the autumn breeze. “I know we’ve got classes, but I could drive you to campus, maybe lunch in between?”
Natalie hesitated, a twinge of guilt pulling at her. She’d already promised Sarah they’d meet up after class on Tuesday, but the thought of disappointing Ethan filled her with a nervous flutter. He’s been nothing but kind, she reminded herself. He deserves this.
“Yeah, I’d like that,” she said, ignoring the whisper of unease coiling in her chest.
As they walked down the bustling street, his hand slid lower on her back, the pressure firmer. He leaned in close, his breath warm against her ear. “I’ve never met anyone like you, Natalie. You’re special.”
The words sent a familiar rush of warmth through her, filling her with a dizzying mix of happiness and apprehension. Ethan seemed to know exactly how to reach the parts of her that needed affirmation, tapping into her insecurities and cradling them with soft words and a gaze that made her feel invincible.
And so, when that small voice inside whispered caution, she shoved it down, focusing instead on the golden glow of the sunset that painted Ethan’s face, the way his smile curved just for her. It was easier, comforting even, to believe in the perfect picture they made together.
“To us,” Ethan said, raising his cup as they settled into the cozy window seat of the café.
Natalie met his eyes and echoed, “To us,” ignoring the flicker of doubt that passed through her like a shadow.

I was at the gym when she asked me if I wanna have lunch so told her sige sunduin kita after I workout. When I got to tje lobby there she was wearing a royal blue sando and I can see her collar bone with her amazing smile. I dont know I have this thing towards chicks with short hair. We talk a bit and I told her if she wants to eat somewhere in Maginhawa instead of the hotel resto and she agreed.  Jusko kinakabog ung dibdib ko, while driving sumusulyap ako sa kanya, mapapahinga ng malalim sabay sabi ""damn ang ganda nya"" 

We went to this Noodles house and I ordered my favorite bowl and some dimsum. Tapos we talked and she was really amazing, eldest ako bunso sya. Though she was born in QC but they moved to the US before turned 1. So that explains the accent but she can understand Tagalog. .

Then we had an ice cream after at Papa Diddy's. So she didnt have an idea what to order so I asked for some sample and funny lang the 3rd scoop she tried she asked ""do you want to try this handing me the icecream which she initially lick"" Mejo lowkey nahiya ang Auntie so I just smiled. When we were eating I asked her to try what I got and she did naman and we talk for more. And one thing she said, ""you know when we match we had less than 10 messages and then we agreed to meet. I like it that way less talk, try to meet and see if you vibe. I mean at first meet if you dont vibe then off the books right, less time wasted."" Feeling ko naman we are okay, ayoko lang mag-assume.

Ayun as I am writing this magkatext pa rin kami Tita FilAm nyo. She's already in Palawan and I'll be going there as well ng Thursday night but she'll leave ng Friday. I would like to see her before she leaves for Nepal so ayun magkikita kami sa hotel and I'll drive her to the airport. I just ordered some coffee as well from my favorite Vietnamese coffee shop and just hope she would like it. 

I really dont know what the future holds, wala na naman to sa plano. Pero sometimes it's not bad to explore di ba, paano natin makikita ung tamang tao para sa atin if di natin hahanapin.

1gp7bil,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShuumatsuNoValkyrie/comments/1gp7bil/anton_szandor_lavey_character_profile/,Anton Szandor LaVey CHARACTER PROFILE," **Name:** Anton Szandor LaVey / Howard Stanton Levey

**Race:** Human

**Gender:** Man

**Nationality:** American

**Titles:**

**- The Satanist**

**- The Black Pope**

**- The Founder of The Church of Satan**

**- Humanity's Most Occult Man**

**- The Hell's Chosen One**

**- The One to Unveil The Mysteries of Gods**

**Backstory:** Howard, later known as Anton was always a talented child. From a young age he became known as someone with great cognitive skills, he could easily play various complicated songs by heart and recite poetry. He was also intrested in many religious subjects, which would later dictate how he lived his life.

At the age of sixteen Howard dropped out of school in favor of joining a carnival where he would take care of animals and play instruments. At the time he didn't knew exactly why he did that, but he felt as if he was led to do this by some mysterious, cunning force. At the time he spent in the carnival he met a bunch of different fortune tellers, magicians, illusionists and other people dealing with something that many would call **the occult**. These people shaped his future views about religion, which he started to view as a bunch of lies, made to cover up the hidden truth.

Levey then started to ignore his duties as a worker, he would rather read books about the occult to try and figure out how he could find out the true meaning of life. Of course, ignoring your duties is not something many buissness owners are fond of, so he was quickly kicked out of his job. He had to find something that would let him provide for himself and not starve, so he used his music skills to become an organist and play in various pubs and bars, in his free time he would still seek out new books and experiment with different rituals.

Some people found out about Howard's research and started to follow him in his tries to unveil the mysteries of the world, these people would one day join The Church of Satan. While gaining followers, Levey started to become a real master in his field, his rituals were slowly starting to work, he could hear the whispers of malevelent entities, it was the same feeling as the one he felt while he decided to join the carnival.

One time when Howard was performing a ritual, the entities told him to change his name, the one had now was apparently not fitting for someone with his goals and ambitions. His new name was **Anton Szandor LaVey**. With this new name, for some reasons his rituals were much more successful, he was slowly rising in power and was gaining new and new followers.

On April 29, 1966 Anton had a dream. He dreamed of a stormy night, he was walking through a dark forest with nothing but a torch in his hands, he could hear steps around him and growling behind. At the end of a crude path he saw four men, each taller than him, with different symbols on their chests. He had a wierd feeling that these four entities were the same ones that guided him his whole life, they were the reason he joined the carnival, studied the occult and changed his name. Their names were: **Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial and Satan.** LaVey could barely see their faces, but a glance was enough to fulfill his life's goal, before he could even open his mouth he woke up with new ideas in his head, he unveiled the truth, just like that.

Anton couldn't keep the truth to himself, he had to share it with others. Even though to stopped hearing the voices he knew exactly what he had to do. LaVey started writing a book titled ""**The Satanic Bible""** in which he hidden the anwsers to the questions of his followers, he also carved different symbols on his left arm, these symbols allowed him to harvest the power of the demons he saw in his dreams. He became The Black Pope.

**Appearane:** Anton is a tall, fit man with a bald head and a beard. He wears a black robe with red collar and buttons. His left ear is decorated with earrings and on his fingers he wears rings. After his sleeves are torned off by Abaddon, the symbols carved into his left arm can be visible.

**Personality:** LaVey has a showman personality, he lefts out a lot of details about the matters he's talking about for the person he's talking with to find out themselves. He uses pretty convoluted speech to appear as someone with great knowledge. Anton is rarely angry and quickly forgives.

**Ability:** 

Anton uses his knowledge and symbols carved into his arm to harvest the power of demons. It allows him to use different powers, based on the abilities of Leviathan, Satan, Lucifer and Belial.

**Volundr:**

Anton Szandor LaVey is the only human fighter without a Volundr, he doesn't need one since the Demonic Powers are of divine origins and as such can hurt gods.

**Named Techniques**

Anton can choose to use the power of different demons, each demon has it's own abilities and powers. Anton changes his appearance based on the demon he chooses.

**- The Hell-Ruling Demon of Wrath - SATAN:** 

Anton's first form, it uses the power of **Satan** to enchance LaVey's strenght and allow him to use **WRATH** \- an ability that sends almost invisible exploding arrows. In this form Anton gains horns and a third eye opens on his forehead

**1) Hellish Rapture:** Anton uses the exploding arrows to propel himself high into the air, he then sends out three arrows at Abaddon, each from a different side.

**2) The Satanist:** Anton uses his enchanced strength to brawl with Abaddon, with each strike he sends out an arrow that explodes when Abaddon parries the hit. This technique is dangerous, since no matter how Abaddon reacts, he will suffer damage, either from an explosion or Anton's fist.

**- The Heaven-Striking Demon of Pride - LUCIFER:**

Anton's second form, it uses the power of **Lucifer** to enchance LaVey's speed and allow him to use **PRIDE** \- an ability that creates a sword made of light, which Anton can control. In this form Anton grows a pair of wings and a halo appears behind his head.

**1) Heavenly Chant:** Anton flies towards Abaddon and slashes him with his sword, he then flies behind him and slashes him again. He repeats the process a few times until Abaddon figures out how to escape the slashing. 

**2) Dies Irae:** Anton summons the sword and commands it to attack without him, he himself flies around Abaddon to confuse him and allow the sword to do all the work.

**- The Sea-Dwelling Demon of Envy - LEVIATHAN**

In this form Anton uses **Leviathan's** power to phase through solid surfaces and use **ENVY** to create decoys of himself. While using Leviathan, Anton's skin becomes green, his eyes yellow and his hand turn into claws.

**1) Coral Crown:** Anton creates a decoy and at the same time sinks into the ground. He swims behind his opponent and jumps at him when he is busy dealing with the decoy. He then tries to sink his opponent, but Abaddon uses **Hell Pit** to open a portal in the same place Anton is.

**2) Floods:** Anton attack before he can recover from his damage. Due to Hell Pit's ability of Abaddon, a portal on LaVey's body sends out a swarm of locust. Anton uses Abaddon's attack to his advantage and swims around him to create a smoke screen made of locust. He then jumps out of the ground and attacks Abaddon from above. (Yes, this is a teaser of Abaddon's ability)

**- Worthless Demon Without a Master - BELIAL:**

The final form of Anton Szandor LaVey, it's also the most powerful, since it fits LaVey the best. It allows him to use **REBEL,** an ability that makes Anton able to create energy blasts with his attacks. In this form LaVey's body becomes metallic, making him much more durable, it also creates a golden crown on his head.

**1) In Hell We Live, Lament** (yes, it's a Project Moon reference)**:** Anton jumps at Abaddon, creating a shockwave. He then starts to punch his enemy with all his strenght, with each stike he creates an energy blast that causes internal damage.

**2) Unveil the Truth: BEHIND THE CURTAINS:** Anton strikes his fist against his other fist, creating an energy blast that tears the air, allowing him to seemingly copy **Hell Pit.** He then jumps from one pit to the other to appear in fron of Abaddon and deal the final strike, if he lands it he will win, if he doesn't, Abaddon will win.

**Opponent: ABADDON**

1gp7962,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/s/YkR2DJZJZc,Post US trip coffee review,"I made a post about a month ago asking for cafe recommendations for a trip to the US. I visited San Fran, Boston, New Orleans, San Antonio and Hawaii.

We are back in Australia now so time for a post trip review.

San Fran coffee is just awful. Every drink, everywhere, was awful. 
Why do they all taste like an ashtray? Is it the water there?
Between my partner and I, we tried black drip, americano, snowy plover, iced lattes.
Nowhere else has this ashtray taste!

Boston was fine. Perfectly drinkable but nothing interesting. 
The black coffee were really clean, but lacking any interesting tasting notes (is ashtray interesting?) 
Ordering coffee here was the most difficult. Especially at Dunkin' Donuts. I have no idea how I got a milk coffee with sugar after asking for black no sugar...
The best coffee we had was from a Capital One Cafe next to our hotel. 

New Orleans was our first interesting coffee. The standard coffee at restaurants and cafes was fine and clean. More flavour profile than Boston. 
But the highlight was the Cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde! Thank u/basketbike for suggesting the one in the park, amazing! So much quieter and the park is incredible. 

San Antonio had our first coffee that was up to my standards in Australian cafes. A place called Vela about a 5m walk from the Alamo. If you are around definitely go there. 
Typical coffee was the same as Boston and NO, clean but lacking flavour. 
But we made a special adventure for breakfast at Tlahco's and a Cafe de olla. This is absolutely incredible. Easily the best coffee concoction I have ever had, I NEED to make it at home now. 

In Hawaii we braved the line at Kona for breakfast for one day. I was underwhelmed. It was just fine, clean with nothing interesting or delicious. Nice pastries though.

Lastly I do not understand why coffee is SO expensive in the states! 
For comparison, my long black in a speciality Cafe in Melbourne is $4.50AUD and there might be the occasional Cafe that charges $5AUD.
In the states drip coffee is between $3.50-4.50USD. Americano was $5USD, iced lattes were up to $6USD and sometimes ask of the above was more expensive.
Being overly kind and just assuming a 150% exchange rate from USD to AUD that's $7.50AUD for an Americano... what?!

Thank you to everyone that made recommendations on my last post, even though we didn't get to every place they were so helpful and I just wanted to post this to get my thoughts back to them in one place and hear from you about whether I'm off the mark, on point, or maybe just a spoilt Aussie when it comes to coffee.

1gp767b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gp767b/aita_for_not_asking_my_bf_if_i_can_get_up_early/,AITA for not asking my BF if I can get up early on weekends?,"So, my (32F) boyfriend (31M) and I have been living together in a small studio for about 4 months now, and we’re planning to move to a 2-bedroom place in < 4 weeks, which we hope will help solve some of these issues.

We have a bit of a routine conflict in the mornings. I work a 9-5 corporate job, while he works in finance (investment banking) with crazy hours, often not getting home until 9-10pm. This means he’s extremely sleep-deprived, and we argue frequently about my alarm clock. I like to wake up around 7am to get my day started with coffee, emails, and taking care of my dog. He, on the other hand, only needs 30 minutes or less to get ready and sets his alarm for 8:20am, asking me to compromise and set mine for 7:45am instead.

On weekends, he wants to catch up on sleep and asks me not to set an alarm, which I try to honor. But sometimes I wake up earlier than him naturally, usually around 8:30-9am. This past weekend, I woke up at 9am on Sunday and tip-toed out of the room as quietly as I could, closing the makeshift room divider behind me. He asked me where I was going, but I didn’t answer because I didn’t want to disturb him further.

He woke up around 10am, cranky, and complained that I keep waking him up early. He said I should’ve just stayed in bed trying not to disturb him and that I should’ve **asked him if it was okay** for me to get up instead of just doing it. He said I should be more concerned about his health and wellbeing, and said I’m not being accommodating to my partner. I pointed out that I’d been as quiet as possible and suggested that if he wanted more sleep, he should try to go to bed earlier the night before (he wanted to stay up for just 30 more min when I suggested heading to bed around midnight).

I get that he’s really tired, but I also think I’m allowed to start my day when I naturally wake up, especially when I try to be considerate.

So, AITA for not asking him if I can get up or for getting out of bed to start my day before he wakes up on weekends?

- Any suggestions in general?
- Good place to eat breakfast/lunch and desserts?
- Cool, local or interesting stores?
- Which Saurkraut do I buy?
- Any interesting beers to try or bring back to the ship?
- suggestions of things to buy/must haves in general?
- Good coffee shops with the possibility to buy good coffee beans (ex Ethiopian, Columbian light roast)?
- Where do I go to buy a good German made chefs knife? Zwillinge or Wusthof?

Thinking I might be low on base malt and enzymes I mashed for longer (around two hours). Ended up with an OG of 1.061. 

I pitched with no issue, it fermented very well, even blew through the air lock of the first night. Cleaned everything up and it kept on bubbling very decently for another 3-4 days. 

Ended up with an FG of 1.060 and I’m at a loss as to what happened. The final product tastes very good, tastes like good stout with notes of coffee so I definetly made beer. But there seem to be something off with my gravity measurements.

1gp6s2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gp6s2p,Latest Premiere Ave Order,"Hadn’t ordered from PA since March, so decided it was time for a treat! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

I ordered MFK’s Mon Beau Sapin candle, and was already familiar with the scent from a room spray sample last year, so no big surprises on this one. It’s just a really great Christmas tree scent. Pretty straightforward, and pretty strong! However, I have not ever tried one of their candles yet, so hoping for good things on the burn!

My second candle is a blind buy from Laurent Mazzone. I had received many of his perfume samples from PA last year, and really loved most of them! Also in this order are two 15ml bottles of my favorite LM perfumes. So, while ordering those, I saw that there are LM candles also and picked the wildest description to blind buy! 😆 

Ok……There is a LOT going on in this candle! Head notes: Tangerine, Bergamot, Cardamom. Heart notes: Fresh Rose, Jasmine, Tiramisu Accord ( 🤔wtf?), Whisky (😲). Base notes: Patchouli, Coffee bean, Cocoa bean (🤯). I’m not sure what to think yet, but it feels like it’s gonna be strong! And hopefully not nauseating!! 😂

The Trudon boxes are refills for the alabasters in AEK and Vesta! I do NOT have the alabaster vessels, but I DO have 3 or 4 different Trudon vessels all cleaned out and ready to reload! Just to make sure it fit, I tried one of them in my green vessel. It plopped right in there neat as can be… a perfect fit ( see last photo)! 👍🏻😃

PA shipping took a bit longer than usual. Ordered last Sunday night, not picked up from PA until Wednesday, was supposed to still arrive Friday but…..it didn’t! For some reason it sat in Atlanta all weekend, but the pkg still arrived today, so about one week from ordering. Not awful, but they have spoiled me in the past with like 2-3 day turnarounds!

As far as their samples go, they have really cut back from last year! My first order from them had twelve samples including 4 Trudon cameos. My last order had ZERO samples, and they claimed they would make it up to me on my next order. But, I only got 5 perfume samples this time. 😑

Sure, it would undeniably be better for the environment of course if we bought more local American goods and less sweatshop-made Chinese plastic stuff from Amazon and Wal-Mart, but that's certainly not realistic for most people, for the time being, so it will only make inflation worse. Certain common goods like coffee, chocolate, and many fruits are pretty much always imported. I saw someone who works in the coffee industry worry about the tariffs. I'm a Toys For Tots volunteer who buys toys to donate out of my own pocket, and I've already seen prices on toys go up post-COVID due to supply chain issues. I can afford to donate less than I used to.

Once both teams were back in Hell’s Kitchen and back in their jackets, Ramsay would remind them that it was Steak Night tonight, and he needed to see the meat stations shine. With that, he had them get started on prep.

In the blue kitchen, Gisele was setting up apps, LaMont and Tami were setting up fish, Stefan was setting up garnish, and Rico was setting up meat. LaMont said in his confessional that Tami looked completely focused and he knew she was determined to make up for the challenge, but just hoped she wouldn’t try to do it all on her own. He would offer some words of encouragement to her, with Tami saying in her confessional that even if others found it annoying, she definitely appreciated LaMont’s boundless positivity in moments like these. Gisele said in her confessional that running apps alone was putting a lot in her hands early on, and it could be just what she needed to show Ramsay what she was capable of. Stefan said in his confessional that he was nervous about Rico running meat alone, as tonight of all nights, that station had to be perfect. Rico said in his confessional that he knew his team didn’t believe in him now, but was sure that would change after this service.

In the red kitchen, Ingram was setting up appetizers, Blake and Johnny were prepping fish, Natasha was prepping garnish, and Finley was setting up meat. Johnny said in his confessional that he couldn’t afford to have a shit service after his performance in the challenge, and it was do or die right now. Blake said in her confessional that everyone was on edge right now, including herself, because they knew that black jackets weren’t far away, and even one bad night could send you home. Ingram said in his confessional that Finley had proven that he could be a beast in the kitchen in the past, but this was a massive test for him, and he was hoping he could step up and deliver. Natasha was more skeptical, as she said in her confessional that Finley would probably get swamped and get service shut down, though that might not be the worst thing from her perspective. Finley was hard at work prepping his section as he said in his confessional that there was no doubt that Natasha was coming after him the first chance she got, but the only thing on his mind was soloing this station and showing Ramsay why he belonged in the top 10.

With prep complete, Ramsay turned to Marino and told him to open Hell’s Kitchen for Steak Night.

**Dinner Service**

Guests streamed into the dining room for this special occasion, as Hell’s Kitchen was featuring a revamped menu catered towards the steak lover. In attendance were two special guests which Ramsay said should provide all the motivation the chefs needed. At the blue team’s chef table was season 13 winner Christina Wilson and her family, while the red team’s chef table was occupied by season 23 winner Ken Morimoto and his family. 

In the blue kitchen, Ramsay gave them Christina’s table first, as he urged them not to fuck this up. Gisele, LaMont and Tami would have no issues communicating on this first table; however, trouble did arise when Gisele admitted that she was dragging on her risottos and needed another minute, while LaMont and Tami were ready with their scallops. Ramsay urged Gisele to wake up, and she said in her confessional that these risottos needed to be perfect. After a long pause, Ramsay told Marino to serve that to Christina, much to everyone’s relief. While their VIPs were enjoying their appetizers, the team moved on to the rest of the dining room, and began to send out food at a good pace. They would hit another snag though, as Gisele served undercooked risotto, but she was able to immediately recover on her next attempt. With appetizers running smoothly, Ramsay said he wanted to see how the kitchen handled appetizers and entrees at the same time, as he read out the first table of entrees for their VIP table. Things did not get off to a great start, though, as Stefan had trouble getting a response from Rico on how long he needed, only for Rico to eventually say that he needed five more minutes. Ramsay was annoyed as he said that he already had the garnish and the tuna, and was just waiting for the ribeye and filet mignon. Rico would eventually bring them to the pass, only for Ramsay to call him back over and berate him for serving him two steaks that were cooked to absolute fuck. Rico said he didn’t want to serve it raw, only for Ramsay to shoot back that avoiding one extreme didn’t mean he should go to the other. He then forced Rico to apologize to Christina for the order being late.

In the red kitchen, Ingram, Blake and Johnny were hoping to get the team off to a good start on apps. Ramsay gave them the VIP ticket for Ken’s table, getting a good response from all three chefs, as Ingram would take the lead on the ticket. The chefs brought their dishes to the pass, and after a close inspection from Ramsay, were soon on the way over to Ken and his family. While the VIPs were enjoying their food, the red kitchen was now setting its sights on the dining room. Ingram would continue to be a strong presence on apps, as he served up perfectly cooked risotto and carbonara, and led the team through a flawless run. Meanwhile, Blake and Johnny worked well together on fish, with Johnny saying in his confessional that when it was all clicking like this, it felt like they were unstoppable. Eventually, Ramsay would announce that he wanted to start firing entrees in addition to appetizers, as he called out the VIP ticket. Natasha misheard the order, though, as she told Finley that there was only one filet mignon on the order despite there being two, which led to a brief moment of chaos in the kitchen before Ramsay stepped in and corrected Natasha, saying it was two filet mignon, and telling her and Finley to wake up and smell the fucking coffee. Finley said in his confessional that for all he knew, Natasha could be trying to sabotage him, but he wasn’t going to let that get in his head. As the first table of entrees went up to the pass, Ramsay was pleased with the filet mignon, saying they were both cooked perfectly, but the swordfish was a different story, as he called Blake over and pointed out that it was undercooked, as he told her not to start slipping now. Blake kicked herself in her confessional as she admitted she wasn’t that familiar with swordfish, but would adjust and bounce back now that she knew what her mistake was. Sure enough, her refire was quickly accepted, and soon entrees were flying out of the red kitchen.

Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen, the team was still trying to process their first order of entrees, with Rico having to refire his ribeye and filet mignon. As he brought the refires to the pass, Rico said in his confessional that these absolutely had to be perfect. Fortunately, Ramsay would accept Rico’s second attempt, and the blue team were finally able to serve Christina’s entrees, which she and her family were seen enjoying. The chefs would begin to serve the rest of the dining room, with LaMont and Tami sending up perfect swordfish and tuna alongside Stefan’s garnish, but Rico continued to struggle on the meat station, as he was falling behind on the high number of orders, then compounded this by serving raw flank steak. Tami said in her confessional that this entire service depended on Rico, and he needed to bounce back quickly. However, after announcing that he needed another five minutes for his ribeye, Ramsay had enough and told Tami to get on meat and help Rico out, because he was bringing the whole fucking service down right now. Rico said in his confessional that he was busting his balls trying to get this station going, and it was disheartening to not be able to handle it. Meanwhile, LaMont served undercooked tuna, while Stefan served cold sauce, and Ramsay quickly became annoyed by the mounting mistakes in the kitchen. LaMont said in his confessional that they needed to shake the bad vibes off, as he would encourage the team to bounce back. Thanks to Tami’s help, Rico finally settled down on the meat station, and with LaMont and Stefan recovering from their mistakes as well on their stations, entrees were once again flying out of the kitchen. Despite their numerous struggles, the blue team eventually crossed the finish line, sending out their last table, as Ramsay told them to clear down.

In the red kitchen, the team was hoping to build off their early momentum on entrees after sending their VIP entree for Ken on their first try, with Finley saying in his confessional that it was a massive relief to just get that right, and now they could focus on crushing this service and making the blue team send another chef home. On the next table though, a communication mixup led to Finley, Blake and Johnny bringing up their entrees before the garnish, with Ramsay berating them for not being on the same page, and demanded to know why the garnish was the slowest out of everyone. Natasha claimed that her team threw her under the bus, and that she had clearly told them that she wasn’t ready. Finley denied this, and said everyone was communicating except her. Ramsay said he didn’t give a fuck who said what, but he didn’t need this service to be ruined by chefs not talking to each other. As the chefs returned to their sections, Blake said in her confessional that she wouldn’t be surprised if Natasha wanted to lose this service so she could take out another teammate, but there was no way in hell she was letting that happen. Sure enough, Blake and Johnny would have a very strong run on fish, as they were in sync and served up nicely cooked swordfish and tuna. Finley, meanwhile, was frantically processing the mountain of orders on the meat station, running up and down the kitchen to bring up his dishes, and he said in his confessional that he had never worked this hard in his life. Fortunately, his steaks were all perfect, as Ramsay praised him for his dedication. Finley said in his confessional that his team was counting on him, and there was no way he was letting them down tonight. Thanks to strong efforts from fish and meat, the red team completed service on a high, and Ramsay finally told them to clear down. 

**Post-Mortem**

Once the teams were lined up, Ramsay said that tonight’s service was, on the whole, not bad, however, the main factor he had taken into consideration to determine the winner was the performance of the respective meat stations, and in that area, there was a clear and decisive winner. He singled out Finley and said that tonight was one hell of a performance, and one that he should be proud of no matter what happened from here on out. With that, he said that the red team won tonight, and thanked them for a solid service. Turning to the blue team, he said that it was a sluggish performance right out of the gate, and it only went downhill once they got to entrees. Even though they had only five chefs from a team that began with twice that number, there were still weak links that needed to be rooted out, and that was why he wanted them to go back upstairs and come back to him with the names of two chefs who could help the blue team improve by going home. 

Back in the dorms, on the blue side, Stefan said there was no question that Rico had to go up, since he made multiple mistakes on meat, which held up the kitchen on entrees. Rico accepted that he had a bad night and deserved the nomination, but argued that he had shown a lot more potential throughout the competition than Gisele, such as winning the punishment pass. Gisele replied that the punishment pass was ages ago, and they needed to go by what they had done lately. Gisele said in her confessional that they might all be on mostly friendly terms with each other, but right now, it was either her or Rico going home, and she was damn sure going to fight for her place here. Tami pointed out that both Gisele and Rico had their issues tonight, and she didn’t really think it was fair for LaMont or Stefan to go up when they had been a lot more consistent. LaMont agreed, as he said that he liked everyone here and didn’t want anyone from this team to go home, but it just wouldn’t be right for anyone other than Rico and Gisele to go up. Gisele would try to argue that LaMont should go up, as she said that he had a very carefree attitude as well, and felt like that could lead to a lack of commitment, but LaMont said that it was simply how he expressed himself and his personality, and he thought it was BS for anyone to question how much he wanted this. Later, Tami would find LaMont sitting alone, as she asked how he was feeling, and LaMont admitted that it sucked having people mistake his attitude for lack of passion, and it made it tough for him to stay positive at times. Tami said it was okay to be vulnerable and his teammates were here for him. LaMont would smile and thank her, as he said in his confessional that he was definitely glad Tami was on their team, and no matter what obstacles he faced, they would never change who he was. 

On the red side, most of the chefs seemed ecstatic to have won another service, with Ingram, Johnny and Blake all congratulating Finley for his performance on the meat station, as Johnny said he pretty much carried them to the finish line there. Finley said in his confessional that he was absolutely exhausted and was probably going to feel sore all day tomorrow, but it was worth it just to get his team this win. Meanwhile, Natasha said in her confessional that Finley did what any line cook would, but as soon as he was presented with anything requiring finesse or leadership, it would be all over for him. Later, Ingram would be alone in the bedrooms when Blake walked in, and noticed the picture of his wife and kids next to his bed. Ingram said that the longer he was away from them, the more it was taking a mental toll, and he couldn’t imagine what the moment was going to be like when they finally reunited. Blake said that she missed her family a lot too, especially her younger brother and sister, as the three of them had a very close bond. Ingram smiled as he said in his confessional that it was hard to imagine Blake as an eldest sibling, but that she had a lot more wisdom than she realized. He would then say that they were both going to have one hell of a story to tell when they got home. Back in the main dorm, Johnny and Finley were still chatting, as Johnny said that they could shock the world if they got to the final 2 together, with Finley replying that he liked the sound of that, and made a joking bet that if he won, Johnny had to get a haircut. 

**Elimination Ceremony**

The blue team entered the dining room and lined up before Ramsay, who said that this was not the kind of service he expected from chefs in the top ten of Hell’s Kitchen, and now it was time to trim the fat once again. With that, he called on Tami and asked her for the blue team’s first nominee and why. Tami replied that the blue team was nominating Rico, because he had been declining for a while, and struggled on the meat station. Ramsay then asked for the second nominee and why, to which Tami replied that they were nominating Gisele, because of her struggles on appetizers and not standing out in the competition to this point. Ramsay said those were definitely the right nominees as he told Rico and Gisele to step forward.

*Deliberation music*

Ramsay told Rico this was his second consecutive night up here, and asked him why he should stay in Hell’s Kitchen. 

Rico: “I think I have the potential to go all the way, Chef. When you look at my overall performance, I think I’ve been stronger than Gisele, I can handle each station. Tonight was kinda shaky, but I know that I can be your next head chef.”

Ramsay: “When you first got here, Rico, you told me to my face that you were the next head chef of HK Foxwoods. That took some bollocks, let me tell you, and I wanted to see that same confidence shine through in the kitchen as a leader, but so far, I am just not bloody seeing it.”

Ramsay then turned to Gisele and asked her why she should stay.

Gisele: “Chef, I believe I am more consistent than Rico. I’ve had some struggles in services, but at the same time, I don’t think I’ve really had a chance to lead. I think if you give me a chance, I can definitely show you the leadership you’re looking for.”

Ramsay: “My issue is, We’re halfway through this competition, and I still haven’t really gotten a sense of who you are. It’s like you’re in the background. How long am I going to have to wait until I see you step up? Because I am running out of time and patience.”

Ramsay said that this was not an easy decision, but after considering all that had happened, there was no doubt in his mind who had reached their limit in this competition. 

Ramsay: “The person leaving Hell’s Kitchen tonight is…”

Ramsay: “Rico, I can’t do it anymore, big boy. Please give me your jacket, your time is done in Hell’s Kitchen.”

*Elimination music*

Ramsay: “Really solid cook, fun personality, but the leadership hasn’t been there, and I know deep down that you are not ready to be the next head chef of HK Foxwoods.”

Rico shook Ramsay’s hand as he handed over his jacket. 

Ramsay: “Listen to me, keep going, and don’t lose sight of your passion. I respect the confidence, now own it.”

**Rico’s Comment**

“Is it disappointin’? Hell yeah it’s disappointin’. To get as far as I did, only to throw it away in one night, it fuckin’ hurts, man. Maybe I just came in too cocky, too sure of myself. But you know what, I don’t regret my time here. I met a great gal, I’m still the best chef in Jersey, and I think we’re gonna make it work. So thanks for havin’ me, Chef, I hope you’ll swing by sometime.”

\-

After Rico’s elimination, Ramsay told Gisele to get back in line, then addressed the final 9 as a group, saying that surviving this far proved that every chef here had the potential to become a great chef, but potential meant nothing without the ability to execute under pressure and lead a brigade, and that was what he was looking for from here on out. With that said, he told the chefs to get back upstairs and get some sleep, because the next day was just going to ramp up the intensity even further. 

As the chefs left the dining room, several had confessionals. 

Gisele said that being in the final 9 was amazing, but she couldn’t let her guard down for a moment, as she was sure her team was looking at her as the weakest chef remaining. Stefan said that with a shorthanded team, each of them needed to step up, and there would be nowhere left to hide. Tami said that it was all coming down to how much they wanted it, and with her parents’ memory guiding her, she was ready to fight through any adversity she faced along the way. Finley said that someone like him shouldn’t have even had a chance in this competition, but as long as people kept doubting him, he was just as determined to make them eat their words. Natasha said that no one here could match her skillset, and it was only a matter of time before she walked away with the prize. Johnny said that the red team was a tight knit family with that one crazy uncle, or aunt, in this case, and said as long as they survived Natasha, he liked their chances to get black jackets.

1gp6mrv,https://v.redd.it/eczvmz0fxc0e1,"from Tea to Coffee, Nescafe to Subko, Mokapot to Picopresso. Hello Doston!","Hello Hello,
I am a regular roadside tea lover from Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. It was 2019 when I saw a friend in Manali waiting in front of a pot which looked like an Arabic vessel. It was basically a moka pot which intrigued me but I hated the taste at first.

During lockdown I bought a random Mokapot from Amazon for 900 or something with a coffee powder by seven beans because it looked good. I used to fill the bottom and top of the moka pot with water and everytime my coffee used to flow out of control. After 10s of attempts, I googled and found out the top needs to stay empty and all.

But then, I started learning on my own. I never realised that coffee world is so big n serious that I would find a lot of content around brewing on the internet.
I kept adding sugar to my coffee. I used to brew coffee once in the morning and then keep reheating it and all.

Everyone around me in Aligarh used to like whatever I brew with loaded sugar before someone said it's not bitter it's burnt. Then I googled to find out that you aren't suppose to reheat the coffee and all. Also, mokapot has a technique blah blah. 

Then aeropress happened and I started liking the coffee without sugar. I learnt about Blue Tokai and KC Roasters. Roast Levels and Grind Sizes. Bhaisahab kaafi zyada zyada scene!

Well, then my friends gifted me a Delonghi Dedica and I started brewing Espresso only to realise there's a world of grinding. You need to grind the beans fresh to brew a good cup. Well, I got a Timemore C3 and an Agaro burr grinder. Game changer!

I became more of a coffee person then a tea person. Which a lot of people are surprised of (because I was never this kind of personality)

Now, I brew decent coffee and know my taste quite well. I am still not an expert, also I really don't want to be a coffee nerd.

This is what I own/use (if that matters for the introduction here or maybe you can ask my review on any of the items)

Espresso:
• Delonghi Dedica with IMS shower screen, Normcore Naked Porta Filter with precision baskets and puckscreen.
• Picopresso with IMS precision basket

Americano:
• Aeropress XL
• Aeropress GO with an able fine disk
• Hario V60 Drip Coffee Decanter 
• Hario Switch 03

Grinders & Accessories:
• Agaro Electric Burr Grinder
• Timemore Chestnut C3
• Agaro Gooseneck Electric Kettle with temprature control
• Instacuppa Stove Gooseneck Kettle with thermometer 
• Hoffen Scale with timer and Maxus travel scale

These days, I am using Picopresso and Aeropress more because I am traveling. Enjoying Blue tokai attikan n silver oak, kc roasters red honey and g-shot ratnagiri. Karada by Kokoro is on its way.

1gp6hbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gp6hbs/normcore_high_extraction_basket/,Normcore High Extraction Basket,"I received the Normcore high extraction basket today. It’s my first time with these fancy baskets and I wanted to give my first impressions because I couldn’t find much info on this basket prior to my purchase. First a little context:

Linea Micra | 6.5 bar

Distilled Water w/ Espresso Profile TWW

Normcore 20g 58mm Basket

Baratza Sette 270 grind size 3 with fine adjustment as fine as it will go. 

17g Black and White Roaster SOE Natural Colombia 

WDT | RDT | Normcore disputation tool | Reg Barber 58.4mm tamper

Normcore 58mm dry paper filter under the coffee

EXTRACTION TIME 18 seconds | 32ml in the cup

I pulled 2 shots around this same recipe. I usually use a 19g Pullman basket and would want more of 23-25 second shot. 

The first thing I notice is a dramatically thinner body. To be honest this is, a lot of change for me. It’s almost hard to get my brain back to being analytical. My initial reaction is to hate this basket and get back to what im comfortable with but I want to grow and learn more so I’m going to give it a chance. 

The aroma isn’t espresso-y in a traditional sense. It’s much easier to smell the terroir of this coffee for sure. It’s sweeter and has a floral note that came across as jammy when pulled in a more traditional way. I wouldn’t call this better it’s just different and that makes it fun. 

There’s very little sourness. I would generally expect a coffee with this texture to taste sour from under extraction but that my brain playing tricks on me. This tastes and feels much more like a pour over which is nice! Tomorrow I will tighten the grind a bit and hope to not get too many channels. If I can get a few more second of extraction time without diluting it more I could see enjoying this a lot. 

I’m also excited to taste in milk. I genuinely expect it to get lost in a 5oz cap but we shall see. ",2,1731367432.0,espresso,6,0.75,False

Sorry in the advance that this is long. I just need to get it off my mind and my two friends are sick and tired of hearing about this. 

Throwaway account because I’m mortified and ashamed this is all what it’s come to. 

A little under 4 years ago, I (F23) met my current partner (33) online and we began a long distance relationship not long after. Despite us living on nearly opposite sides of the country, we met in person several times and learned we were seemingly perfect for each other. We both seemed to be people who have our quirks and imperfections but everything seemed so perfect when we were together. I felt so comfortable with them and they expressed the same to me. We had similar senses of humor, liked a lot of the same things, and just seemed to compliment each other in every way. And in the beginning, it seemed like this would be my forever person. 

The first two times we met in person, I went to visit them and we stayed in a hotel near the house they lived in with their parents. At first, I was a tiny bit thrown off by them still living with their parents, especially since they had never moved out at any point or lived anywhere else and I myself moved out at 17, but I was young and naive and chalked it up to finances and the economy being shitty.

For the first visit, since I drove all the way out to them, they covered the entire hotel cost, although I offered to pay for some of it. The second time, even though I flew out to see them, I covered a significant portion of the hotel cost. But that seemed fair to me at the time and wasn’t a red flag. While I was there the second time, I met their parents and they were and still are the sweetest people ever. Things went really fast and got very intense quickly with my partner, which I enjoyed at first. We weren’t shy in proclaiming our love for one another, and they often told me they would hurt themselves if we ever weren’t together. This didn’t scare me at first because I guess I’m a little crazy too and I told them I felt the exact same way. Looking back, maybe I’m to blame for encouraging the behavior. 

Fast forward to summer of that year, I moved out of the house I was living in with 3 other girls and got a small basement studio apartment of my very own without a co-signer and my name was the only one on the lease. I was so proud. My partner came to visit me a bunch throughout the summer, and either I paid for their flight or my aunt graciously used her airline miles to book a flight on their behalf, since I was a full time student working full time hours while I was on summer break and didn’t always have the money on me, as rent was a few hundred dollars more expensive then living with roommates and now I was responsible for all utilities (ratioed, but still more pricy then splitting the entire cost 4 ways) on my own.  

The “reason” my partner didn’t pay for either their own flights or help with any other costs (they were staying with me a lot) was because they didn’t have a job and hadn’t had one since the early days of when we began speaking, so if I wanted to see them, it would have to be on my dime. Additionally, I stupidly wanted to buy their love and would go all out buying them gifts all the time. Granted, they never asked me to buy or pay for anything for them. This was all voluntary and I was happy to do it at the time because I was so in love and happy. I recognize now I was being stupid. 

We discussed my partner moving in with me to save money on travel costs and so they can finally settle down and get a job or go back to school, but remember how I mentioned we both have our weird quirks? Well, one of mine was that I owned two ferrets at the time and, while they had their own designated area of the apartment with a door that closed to block that area off from the main apartment area, I know they had a certain odor and my partner was not shy at all about their displeasure of it. I did everything I could to minimize the smell, cleaned their cage regularly, mopped the floor after they would be out of their cage running around, even changed my shirt and washed my hands after holding one of them (this was upon my partners request, not something I just thought of) but nothing was ever good enough and it was a constant complaint.

Additionally, not through direct remarks but veiled ones, they criticized my apartment. They said the bathroom was too small (one of their quirks is they use the bathroom 1-3 times a day for a minimum of 45 minutes each time but up to 2 hours each time) so bathroom size was important to them, they couldn’t flush the wipes they like to use because the buildings old plumbing couldn’t handle it (another weird quirk, they can NOT use toilet paper, it has to be flushable wipes and they HAVE to flush them. We tried compromising with having them put the used wipes in a plastic bag and throw them away in the outside garbage after each trip, but they tried it once and refused to try it again), the space of the apartment itself was too small, etc. They grew up very comfortable (think somewhere between upper middle class and wealthy) and so they have never not lived in a big, nice house in a nice neighborhood. 

They tried moving in with me after the new year (I spent the holidays in her home state with her family because I don’t have a super close/cohesive family to celebrate with anymore since my grandma passed in 2020) but it was a disaster. Once we had spent days driving their car with all their stuff in it across the country to my apartment (I paid for gas, hotels, food, and we split driving) they basically just shut down. They just laid in bed or played video games all day while I was in classes or at work and refused to look for a job or try to integrate themselves into the new area at all. 

I admit, some of it was due to their depression and also not having their medications for depression and ADHD, and as someone with severe mental health issues of my own, I was extremely sympathetic and empathetic. But when they moved out with me, they had a new 30 day supply of both their meds from their doctor back home and all they would have needed to do was apply for state insurance (in the state where I lived, if you have no income and/or are new to the state, you can apply outside of the normal enrollment period and are pretty much guaranteed to be accepted) and find a new provider in the area, which I repeatedly offered to help her with, but they always brushed me off. I even offered to pay for the medications and sessions with a psychiatrist until insurance kicked in, they turned me down. 

The same thing happened when I’d suggest places they could apply for a job at or suggest they look into classes at the local community college, as their parents had a deal with them and their siblings that all classes they took and got a C or above in they would pay for. But no job position or company was ever “good enough” for them in some way, despite having no education beyond high school and not having any prior work experience to put on a resume/application due to every job they’d ever had ending in either being let go or them quitting without proper notice. They always said they would be interested in college classes but never made any steps towards enrolling or even deciding what major they’d want to go into, even when I offered to get them in contact with the local community college so they could at least get started on completing their general courses. 

After a few months of this, including them completely blowing off our first anniversary by just laying in bed and refusing to even go out to dinner with me somewhere casual, my treat, I had a serious talk with them and they finally admitted they wanted to go back home. So we packed up all their stuff and drove her back to her parents house across the country. I, again, paid for all the gas, hotels, food, and drove a good portion. We agreed to stay together and continue long distance as we had done before. 

Well, it wasn’t long before I decided that since my partner wouldn’t move to where I lived, I’d move to where they lived. I’ve always been kind of a mentally unstable, “grass is always greener on the other side”, “I’ll do anything for love” kind of person, so I guess I kind of just convinced myself there was no reason to stay where I was anymore. I had spent so much time wrapped up in the relationship and working long hours at my job and also, admittedly, just being really lazy and unmotivated, that I failed or dropped a lot of my classes I needed to get into my major program (separate from standard admission into the school) so I transferred my credits to one of the only schools in my state that had a completely online program for my major (no schools in my partners state would accept my transfer credits, at least not according to a few sites I used). I also convinced myself that the job I had was going nowhere and, while it was okay money and I didn’t hate the work I was doing, it wasn’t my dream job and I knew I could find something else I enjoyed just as much or even more in the area my partner lived in. Plus, at that point, I had a good few years of work experience under my belt and left on good terms with my previous employers and co workers, so I knew I’d have good references to fall back on. 

I got rid of my beloved ferrets. I still regret it but I made sure they went to a good home with a family that had other ferrets and would be able to shower them in love and attention. I felt like they deserved better then me, I spent all my time working or in classes and besides, my partner tolerated them and even liked them on some occasions, but I knew if me and them had a future together, the ferrets had to go. And that alone made me undeserving of being their pet mama. I should have fought for them, they had been there for me throughout the hardest times of my young adult life, but I didn’t stand by them when it mattered most and it still haunts me, but I made my choice and now I have to deal with it.  

As for my family and very few friends, I convinced myself they wouldn’t miss me and I wouldn’t miss them. In my mind, everything was going to be better because I’d be with my love, my everything. My partner never asked me to do any of this, I did it all willingly. Their parents offered to let me live with them in their home rent free while we saved money to get our own place. I started my job search while I was still living in my home state and by the time I had put in my notice at my current job, I had a job offer I’d accepted for a position I was really excited about in my partners home state. I met via Zoom with my new academic advisor at the new university I’d be starting online classes through and registered for fall classes. I was all set to start new. My partner, at this point, still did not have a job and was not in school and seemingly had no intentions of doing either. But I stupidly thought that, once I was out there, I could help them and they would change. 

So why did I stay with them? Why was I doing this, uprooting my whole life for someone I’d been with for not even a year and a half? Because even though there were some things that were wrong, everything still felt so right, and there were moments they would really show how much they cared and loved me in ways no else could or would. One of the biggest examples is that they flew out, on my dime but regardless, to help me move. Yes, I helped them move out to me and then back to their parents, but I had a whole apartments worth of things to pack and then load into my pretty small car, and at one point I had a mental breakdown because moving is triggering for me and I shut down, so my partner had to take over. They are the only reason everything got packed and arranged perfectly in my car. They were kind but firm with telling me no when I wanted to take something that wasn’t necessary and also couldn’t fit in my car. They hugged me and we took a break when I’d start to cry. I couldn’t have done it without them. 

When we finally got to their parents, they all helped me unload my car and I discovered that, although I was obviously welcome to be in my partners room when I wanted, I also had a whole room to myself (one of my partners siblings old room) which was so nice and thoughtful of their parents. I was welcomed and treated very nicely. I started my new job after about a week, and although it had its challenges due to the nature of the work I was doing, I was enjoying it. Everything with my partner seemed to be going ok relationship wise, although we started to settle into a routine that I came to hate and resent. I worked everyday, Monday through Saturday, and during this time, they stayed in the basement playing video games and working on researching niche subjects for fun, which I always encouraged because not only did it make them happy but I believed it could eventually be useful in some way, but not in the way they do it, as this wasn’t for a class or a grade or even money. I asked them and they weren’t even planning for any of their work to be compiled for future academic use. Which is fine, hobbies for enjoyment without any other motive is a good thing, but when it’s objectively the only productive thing you’re doing, you gotta kinda take a step back and examine what you’re doing with your life. 

Long story short, I was trying to juggle doing classes full time with working a demanding job that worked with demanding clients and it got to the point where I developed a drinking problem as a coping skill. This is something my partner encouraged inadvertently, as they have a drinking problem as well and had for years before we met. I broke down one day in January 2023 in the middle of their parents kitchen and I cried to my partners mom about how I didn’t know what I was doing at my job and how I felt like I wasn’t making progress with my clients, even after switching to working for a new agency that I thought would be better attuned to my skill set. My partners mom was so sweet and told me that I could quit my job if I felt it was best and just focus on school and that I didn’t need to worry about them thinking less of me (something I mentioned while I was crying).

I hardly remember January 2023-September 2023 honestly, it was all a big blur. I pretty much just laid in bed and neglected all my classes due to being depressed and dissociating. I drank at least one 750ml bottle of vodka nearly everyday and smoked a bunch (or vaped, should I say, as it’s legal in my partners state and I’d buy carts from the dispensary) and was just miserable. I was also having a lot of physical pain and I’d go to the ER a few times a month thinking I had chest pain or because my stomach hurt. During this time, my partner barely noticed. I’d lay in bed all day and at maybe 9, 10 at night they would text me for the first time all day, when we lived in the same house. I’m not saying it was their duty to check on me or something, but I was drowning in my own sorrow and depression and when the roles were reversed, I got them help and made sure they went back home safe. I’m not saying I deserve a medal for that, I just was hoping for the same treatment to be returned to me when I so clearly needed it. 

Since I had no income but still had expenses (car payment, car insurance, phone bill, food for myself while I was hidden away in the room) I maxed out all my credit cards, spent my very small savings, pawned everything I had that was worth money aside from my iPhone, and trashed my room because I was too depressed and in pain to get up and clean it. I would wake up in my own dried vomit almost everyday and I slept close to 20 hours a day most days. At some point during this, my partner got their job back at the place they worked at before we got together. I assumed they were saving their paychecks since their parents paid all their bills (phone and car insurance) and didn’t charge either of us rent, but they only worked 4 hour shifts on the weekends (by their choice, that’s all they wanted to work) so it wasn’t a ton of money to begin with and they’d drink it all or spend it on fast food. I wanted to say something but I felt like a hypocrite since I didn’t even have a job and had not only spent all my money but was going into debt buying alcohol and doordashing food several times a week. So I just let them do whatever they wanted and they did the same to me. 


Everything all came to a head in August of 2023 when my dad and I went on a trip to my favorite city to see one of my favorite musical artists preform live. And I felt nothing. I just couldn’t feel happy. Everything was perfect and all I could see was darkness. My dad noticed and tried to get me to talk to him but I didn’t want to worry him because he’s getting old and has health problems of his own to worry about, so I told him I was just feeling a little down and maybe just needed to look into getting my medications adjusted, which was a lie on multiple levels since I hadn’t seen a therapist or been on medications since I lived in my home state. I was just letting myself be miserable and that made me hate myself even more. I was turning into everything I hated about my partner. 

A few days after I got home from my trip, I was having intense thoughts of hurting myself and decided to go to the hospital so I wouldn’t hurt myself, since it was all I wanted to do but I couldn’t do that to my dad and my partner and their parents, especially not in their home. I was gone all day and laid in a hospital room waiting to get transported to another hospital where they had a psych wing. My partner finally texted me at around 9, 10pm asking where I was. I told them the truth, and of course they were concerned then, but by that time, I had to give my phone up and I called her from the psych hospital the next morning. 

I spent a few days in the hospital and it essentially did nothing but keep me physically safe. They discharged me with a one month supply of medications but no prescription or resources for establishing follow up care. It just so happened that my partner was working on the day I was released from the hospital, so their mom came to pick me up. We didn’t talk much during the drive home, but she was very sweet and didn’t seem mad at all, which I wasn’t expecting due to the fact that I probably worried their child for days and they probably had to hear all about it. 

Shortly after that, me and my partner got our own apartment because their parents were moving out of the house and into a new house a few hours away to start their (semi) retirement years. My partner had no money saved up from working, and the money they had in their savings account was for when they wanted to go back to school someday, so since I had just gotten a large settlement payment, I paid for the deposit and first months rent in full at our new apartment. Because my partners parents are angels and truly the kindest, most generous people I’ve ever had the fortune of knowing, not only did my partners father co-sign for us to get our apartment (my partner didn’t have enough income to qualify and I still didn’t have a job, although at this point I’d snapped out of my funk a bit and was applying to places left and right and even had a few interviews during the time when we were moving) but they offered to help us with rent for a year. 

What ended up happening is where the issues really started getting bad. I spent all my settlement money on buying things for the apartment and paying the remaining rent and utilities after applying the money my partners parents would give us monthly. During this time, my partner paid $0 towards rent, utilities, groceries, or any other bills. They also did zero chores. Yes, they were still working at this time, but they were on thin ice with their employer and started having the very few shifts they were regularly scheduled for (4 hours every Saturday and Sunday) because they kept calling out last minute and being an hour late to their shifts for no reason. I was still trying to get a job and end eventually got one in November 2023. 

It was truly an awful job with awful hours (16 hours shifts back to back) and awful pay but it was money. I was working with a difficult clientele once again and it was truly an awful horrible experience. I also had to commute 45 minutes each way at 6am and 11:30pm in the dark and cold. During this time, I was still paying for everything, minus the money my partners parents sent to go towards rent each month, and also doing all the chores and household things like grocery shopping and replenishing things that were getting low/running out, like dish soap, paper towels, etc. It was truly exhausting and I really really resented my partner during this time, especially because it seemed like I had changed my entire life multiple times to try and be better for us and our future, and they were getting to stay the exact same. 

To make things worse, my partner got fired from their job in December because they called out randomly last minute on their Christmas Eve shift and the owner said he was sick of not having someone reliable. My partner openly said “I’m going to wait a while to find a new job” and no matter how much I told them they needed to at least LOOK for one, they refused. 

In February of this year, I found a new job that I LOVED. I was making more money, had a steady set schedule working hours I loved, and I was doing work I was passionate about. Things were finally kind of looking up. I finally felt a small spark inside of me light up again, I felt like I could be proud of myself again, like I wasn’t a total loser with no life. I threw myself into my job and being the best employee I could be, working extra shifts that were open, really trying to connect with the population I served, trying to get along with my co workers and boss. 

Then in May, I realized I had missed my period. I’m pretty regular and I’d also been feeling really off and needing to pee a lot, so I took a pregnancy test in the bathroom at work because I thought I was being ridiculous. I was pregnant. After my shift, I went to a nearby 24 hour grocery store and bought three more tests, and all of them were positive. Call me stupid, but while I was really scared and shocked, I was also….excited. Me and my partner had talked at length from the very beginning about how we wanted kids, and even though this wasn’t the optimal time, I had a good job and I really hoped that this would make my partner get a job and finally we could move into the next part of our lives.

Needless to say, that isn’t what happened. When I first told them, they managed to seem empathetic. I brought up how I know I always thought I’d get an abortion if I got pregnant accidentally, but I wasn’t entirely sure now. I saw a dark storm cloud pass over my partners face but they managed to compose themselves and say “well, think about it.” A few days later, I come to them and say I’m still not sure about aborting and how I think we could do it if we really tried, especially since I was still really early on in the pregnancy at that point so we would have many months to figure things out. The person I saw before me in that moment was NOT my partner, or at least not a version of them I’d ever seen before. They didn’t get “mad” but just very…stern? Almost as if they were reprimanding a small child or someone so dumb they couldn’t understand basic words. I don’t remember all of what was said, since I think even in the moment I was blocking a lot of it out for my own protection, but basically they tried to guilt me by saying “you said if this ever happened you’d get an abortion” and then saying “what are my parents gonna think?”

I acknowledged from the very beginning that I kn ow I’d originally thought I’d want to abort, and I truly really thought that it would be that cut and dry, but for some reason I just was having a really hard time with the decision. And instead of seeing that and trying to be any kind of sympathetic or empathetic, my partner just yelled at me and tried to guilt me. Also, just to note, it’s not like we had the conversation of “if I get pregnant I’ll get an abortion” very often, and also, the two most recent times we had unprotected sex that most likely led to me getting pregnant were both when I was pretty much blackout drunk and they were stone cold sober, so anything I said while in that state, I don’t remember and I think it’s really egregious that they would hold me to that without even understanding my side. 

Regardless, I understood that I wasn’t going to win with this. After a barrage of text messages I got from them while I was at work that night (basically just saying the same thing, how I promised I’d get an abortion and I needed to keep my promise) I did research on abortions in my area. Luckily, they are pretty easily accessible in the state my partner is from, and I was early enough in the pregnancy that I could get a pill abortion. I wanted to get it from a clinic in person though because I wanted to make sure everything went right, so I made the appointment to be in person just a few days later. 

I went alone. My partner didn’t offer to come with me and I didn’t ask. I went after I got off of work and drove about an hour to the place because it was the cheapest but most reputable clinic I could find. They did an ultrasound on me and couldn’t for certain see the fetus, although they thought they could see the sac very faintly. They gave me another pregnancy test and it was still positive so they wanted me to come back the next week to see if they could see something then. I cried all the way home and just knew this was a sign I should keep the pregnancy, but I knew I couldn’t. Or maybe I could have, but I was once again a coward, not willing to fight for something I wanted because it wasn’t what my partner wanted. But in this case, it felt a little different, since it’s also their baby, and if they don’t want it, what kind of person would I be keeping it, knowing the baby would no matter what have an absent parent? I was still also feeling guilt over having promised my partner I’d abort if this ever happened, so I tried to brush aside any thoughts I had that I should keep it. 

I went back the next week, alone, again, and I went right after work. They were able to see the fetus this time and determined I was just barely six weeks along. They gave me the pills I needed to take and told me what to expect. The abortion cost $500 and I had to use my credit card I’d just paid off because I didn’t have the cash. I went home and did what I was supposed to. I was supposed to have the weekend off but someone called out the next night and so I went in to work wearing an adult diaper under my clothes and hoped no one noticed. I cried in the bathroom during the downtimes. 

I got promoted to supervisor at work a month later and that kind of led to my downfall. My partner still didn’t have a job, wasn’t even applying for places because, once again, nothing was good enough for them. I was working roughly 50-60 hours a week while only being paid for 40 of them, because being supervisor required all these meetings and trainings and being on call for if one of my direct reports couldn’t come in for a shift they signed up for. Not even mentioning some issues I was having with one of my direct reports being insubordinate and calling out all the time and upper management dragging their feet on writing her up or firing her. 

In September of this year, I had a massive mental breakdown under all the pressure and I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital. Before I went, I sent my partner my last $200 so they could buy cat food/litter (we finally got two kitties in June after the abortion because my partner felt a little bad and knew I needed it after the loss) and groceries because I didn’t know how long I was gonna be gone. I wasn’t expecting this, nor did I ask for this, but everyday I was in the hospital, my partner came to visit me. During this time, we laughed, played games they brought for us to play, ate food they brought for me, and it was honestly the most supportive and loving they had been in months. I’m still not sure what made her do that, because even though I know she loves me, it seemed a little out of character for them to come EVERY day, as they usually would go days without leaving the apartment and hated human interaction. But I was glad for her coming, as it gave me something to look forward to every day. 

The nurse practitioner I saw while I was in the hospital got me back on medications and recommended I participate in an outpatient program at the day hospital when I was discharged. I agreed and I did that for two weeks after being discharged. While I was doing the outpatient program, two things happened. The first was that I had to be sober because they wanted to see how the medications were working for me and substances would get in the way of the medications effectiveness. Secondly, I talked at length with a psychiatrist that told me that the symptoms I was experiencing and the feelings I had described to him didn’t fit my previous diagnosis but instead pointed to a different, more difficult to treat mental disorder. I won’t go into details because I really don’t want to, but it made a lot of sense to me and it kind of broke me in a way, because not only does this disorder have a horrible reputation but it’s the same one my abusive, explosive mother was suspected to have but she refused to be evaluated so we’ll never know. 

Throughout this, my partner attempted to be supportive, but honestly, I came to realize that they had never needed to be emotionally or otherwise consistently supportive for another person ever. They grew up with healthy parents that didn’t emotionally or otherwise rely on their children, so they never had to care for their parents like I did growing up. And I’m so glad for them for that, since it’s a horrible thing to have happen, but since my partner has also isolated themselves in terms of friendships or other family relationships, they don’t have the skill of emotionally supporting someone that I or most people have developed as either children or adults. And they weren’t willing to learn either, mostly because I’d made them believe the very minimal effort they put forth was enough, when it wasn’t even close to the bare minimum between two adult partners, especially given how much I’d given in the relationship. 

After the outpatient program ended, I was supposed to go back to work. Since I’d communicated with my boss and HR throughout this whole process, they were willing to work with me and kept my job open through my treatment. But in addition to feeling mentally unwell, I was also starting to feel physically sick again and found myself going back to the ER for various ailments I was convinced were life threatening and it pushing me to the brink of insanity again. I decided to resign from my position before they were forced to fire me. 

When this happened was when my partner FINALLY decided to start applying to jobs. But they were still being very very picky on the kinds of jobs they were applying for and also, I only just found out, they were completely BOMBING the very few interviews they did get. Which honestly, shouldn’t have been surprising to me, but it was a little surprising that they thought answering the question “Can you explain the gap in your job history?” with “oh I was living at home with my parents and didn’t need a job” was appropriate. 

So that brings us to now. I’ve been trying to apply to a few part time or seasonal jobs since I lost my job officially, but my mental and physical well-being hasn’t really improved and I’ve been drinking a lot again to deal with it all. The little bit of money I had from already scheduled vacation time I got paid out from work has run out so now I don’t have money and neither does my partner, although NOW they are digging into their savings, since they’d rather do that I guess than get a job. Their parents paid this months rent in full, which I didn’t want to accept but had no choice. I thanked them profusely. 

I’ve been pulling away from my partner the last few days because I decided I’m breaking up with them and moving back to my home state. I have no plan for when I get there, I don’t even have the money for the gas it would take to get there, but I’ll borrow it from my dad if need be or sell my laptop. A friend in the area gave me the number for an organization that helps young people find housing and what not, and I could get a job at one of my old employers and save money while I live in my car, which is thankfully paid off at this point. I don’t know how I’ll afford insurance for it but I guess I just have to hope I don’t get pulled over at any point and I’ll be good. 

I just know I can’t stay here. I’m planning on having coffee with my partners mom tomorrow to tell her what I’m planning so they can be prepared that their child is going to ask to come live with them again and also so they can help keep them safe, since my partner has expressed to me many times, mostly while intoxicated but a few times while stone cold sober, that they would end their own life if we couldn’t be together. I just want my partner to be safe, no matter what has happened, I don’t want them to hurt themselves. 

I also want to offer to pay my partners parents back for everything they have done for us financially. I don’t want them to think I’m ungrateful or don’t acknowledge all they have done for us. So I want to offer to pay them back in installments once I get a job again. I feel bad I’m going to be ruining their newfound freedom in their retired life but I can’t do this anymore. I know the blame is mostly mine in all this happening, but no matter whose fault, I can’t do it anymore. I can’t stay here. Our lease ends at the end of December and we were gonna sign for another year, but I can’t do it. 

I won’t be able to take the cats with me, which makes me feel so so awful and breaks my heart, and I just hope my partner doesn’t get rid of them. The cats deserve better then us, they deserve better then me, but I don’t want them back in the shelter especially because while they are still young they aren’t little kittens anymore and who knows how long it’ll take for them to be adopted. Maybe I’ll try to find a good home for them before I leave if my partner says they will get rid of them, but I still feel horrible and like such a shitty pet parent. I know at this point I don’t deserve animals and I probably won’t get another pet after this. 

I feel so horrendously awful that this how this is ending. Almost 4 years, and this is it. The hardest part is just walking away. I always thought we would be forever and if we could just go back to the magic we had at the beginning, before we really knew each other, before we had to live in reality, or rather, before they refused to and I had to for the both of us, I’d stay forever. But nothings gonna make them change, not me being pregnant with their child, not me crying and begging, not me being so physically and mentally sick that I had to go to the hospital and lose my job I loved so much. Nothing. Everything’s gonna have to change for me just so it can stay painfully the same for them. And I get that now. 

I haven’t told my partner any of this yet, I’m waiting to talk to their mom tomorrow so that she can be on standby in case they threaten to off themselves or hurt themselves. I have no idea what’s going to happen or how they are going to react. My biggest fear, aside from them hurting themselves over the news, is that I won’t be able to go through with it. That I’ll do what I’ve done before, that I’ll go to say all this to them, and I’ll look into their eyes and be so overcome with how much I do still love them that I won’t be able to do it. 

But I just need to remind myself that this is good. And even though it sucks that I’m going to have to change in such a big way again just for them to be able to go back to how they were for the first 32 years of their life, living at home with their parents, playing video games and doing what they want all day, this will be the last time I’ll ever have to do it. 

I just hope I can get myself some of myself back while also keeping some of the happiness being with my partner gave me in the beginning. Because we were happy at one point, and I know all of what I’ve said makes it sound like it was all miserable. I just have compassion fatigue at this point and the rose colored sunglasses I’ve seen them through all these years have lost their tint. I also am just so tired that being loved and loving someone isn’t something I’m willing to give my whole self for anymore. I’m sure that’ll change when I’m alone again, since that’s just who I am, but I’ll deal with that when it happens. I’m just scared but I can’t use that as a shield anymore.

1gp6fao,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gp6fao/need_some_advice/,Need Some Advice," It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram.

I have nearly 20 years of habits that I need to change. My drinking is very heavy to some but part of me justified it as it seemed small compared to others. My routine is 4-6 drinks (mostly beer but will drink literally anything) weeknights and upwards of 18 (have hit double this number many,many times as well) starting sometime before noon weekends and days off. Other justifications were that I consumed slowly “I didn’t drink to get drunk”, but consistently. I have the highest tolerance of anyone I know and never threw up, and hangovers were mild anxiety with mild shakes. I’ve never had the weight gain and lived an active life.

I believe the habit started as self medication for ADHD.

I had two weeks of sobriety (I’ve only done this twice in nearly 20 years) leading up to this previous weekend where my wife and visited Portland for our 9 year anniversary. Saturday I drank all day and we finished the evening going to a rock show. Everything was great. When we got out at roughly 11 I wanted to walk for a little, she didn’t feel comfortable doing that late night and called an Uber which started a fight. I was in the wrong clearly and well past drunk. I let her get in the Uber alone and walked 6 miles back to the hotel. I ended up passing a group of roughly 10 younger guys harassing an older gentleman. I ended up talking shit to the guys and the entire group ended up chasing me, luckily I’m still pretty quick for my old age but as I was taunting them running, laughing, I couldn’t help but think of all the negative possibilities that could have been. About a block down there was one left and I turned around and said “you’re by yourself now dude, what are you going to do?” Thankfully he backed off. I have a wife, I have young kids. This was sooooo damn stupid. This is just one of the millions of stupid things I’ve done while being under the influence and I hate it. 

I made it back to the room, my wife wasn’t as upset as she should have been but this was my rock bottom. Sunday morning I had a bloody Maria, 2 beers, an Irish coffee, and mimosa as a bit of hair of the dog to get rid of the anxiety. Fully sober today with my last drink being Sunday at roughly noon. I feel like shit but I’m ready to make the changes that need to happen for the well being of me and my family. ",8,1731366981.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I just need to get it off my mind and my two friends are sick and tired of hearing about this. 

Throwaway account because I’m mortified and ashamed this is all what it’s come to. 

A little under 4 years ago, I (F23) met my current partner (33) online and we began a long distance relationship not long after. Despite us living on nearly opposite sides of the country, we met in person several times and learned we were seemingly perfect for each other. We both seemed to be people who have our quirks and imperfections but everything seemed so perfect when we were together. I felt so comfortable with them and they expressed the same to me. We had similar senses of humor, liked a lot of the same things, and just seemed to compliment each other in every way. And in the beginning, it seemed like this would be my forever person. 

The first two times we met in person, I went to visit them and we stayed in a hotel near the house they lived in with their parents. At first, I was a tiny bit thrown off by them still living with their parents, especially since they had never moved out at any point or lived anywhere else and I myself moved out at 17, but I was young and naive and chalked it up to finances and the economy being shitty.

For the first visit, since I drove all the way out to them, they covered the entire hotel cost, although I offered to pay for some of it. The second time, even though I flew out to see them, I covered a significant portion of the hotel cost. But that seemed fair to me at the time and wasn’t a red flag. While I was there the second time, I met their parents and they were and still are the sweetest people ever. Things went really fast and got very intense quickly with my partner, which I enjoyed at first. We weren’t shy in proclaiming our love for one another, and they often told me they would hurt themselves if we ever weren’t together. This didn’t scare me at first because I guess I’m a little crazy too and I told them I felt the exact same way. Looking back, maybe I’m to blame for encouraging the behavior. 

Fast forward to summer of that year, I moved out of the house I was living in with 3 other girls and got a small basement studio apartment of my very own without a co-signer and my name was the only one on the lease. I was so proud. My partner came to visit me a bunch throughout the summer, and either I paid for their flight or my aunt graciously used her airline miles to book a flight on their behalf, since I was a full time student working full time hours while I was on summer break and didn’t always have the money on me, as rent was a few hundred dollars more expensive then living with roommates and now I was responsible for all utilities (ratioed, but still more pricy then splitting the entire cost 4 ways) on my own.  

The “reason” my partner didn’t pay for either their own flights or help with any other costs (they were staying with me a lot) was because they didn’t have a job and hadn’t had one since the early days of when we began speaking, so if I wanted to see them, it would have to be on my dime. Additionally, I stupidly wanted to buy their love and would go all out buying them gifts all the time. Granted, they never asked me to buy or pay for anything for them. This was all voluntary and I was happy to do it at the time because I was so in love and happy. I recognize now I was being stupid. 

We discussed my partner moving in with me to save money on travel costs and so they can finally settle down and get a job or go back to school, but remember how I mentioned we both have our weird quirks? Well, one of mine was that I owned two ferrets at the time and, while they had their own designated area of the apartment with a door that closed to block that area off from the main apartment area, I know they had a certain odor and my partner was not shy at all about their displeasure of it. I did everything I could to minimize the smell, cleaned their cage regularly, mopped the floor after they would be out of their cage running around, even changed my shirt and washed my hands after holding one of them (this was upon my partners request, not something I just thought of) but nothing was ever good enough and it was a constant complaint.

Additionally, not through direct remarks but veiled ones, they criticized my apartment. They said the bathroom was too small (one of their quirks is they use the bathroom 1-3 times a day for a minimum of 45 minutes each time but up to 2 hours each time) so bathroom size was important to them, they couldn’t flush the wipes they like to use because the buildings old plumbing couldn’t handle it (another weird quirk, they can NOT use toilet paper, it has to be flushable wipes and they HAVE to flush them. We tried compromising with having them put the used wipes in a plastic bag and throw them away in the outside garbage after each trip, but they tried it once and refused to try it again), the space of the apartment itself was too small, etc. They grew up very comfortable (think somewhere between upper middle class and wealthy) and so they have never not lived in a big, nice house in a nice neighborhood. 

They tried moving in with me after the new year (I spent the holidays in her home state with her family because I don’t have a super close/cohesive family to celebrate with anymore since my grandma passed in 2020) but it was a disaster. Once we had spent days driving their car with all their stuff in it across the country to my apartment (I paid for gas, hotels, food, and we split driving) they basically just shut down. They just laid in bed or played video games all day while I was in classes or at work and refused to look for a job or try to integrate themselves into the new area at all. 

I admit, some of it was due to their depression and also not having their medications for depression and ADHD, and as someone with severe mental health issues of my own, I was extremely sympathetic and empathetic. But when they moved out with me, they had a new 30 day supply of both their meds from their doctor back home and all they would have needed to do was apply for state insurance (in the state where I lived, if you have no income and/or are new to the state, you can apply outside of the normal enrollment period and are pretty much guaranteed to be accepted) and find a new provider in the area, which I repeatedly offered to help her with, but they always brushed me off. I even offered to pay for the medications and sessions with a psychiatrist until insurance kicked in, they turned me down. 

The same thing happened when I’d suggest places they could apply for a job at or suggest they look into classes at the local community college, as their parents had a deal with them and their siblings that all classes they took and got a C or above in they would pay for. But no job position or company was ever “good enough” for them in some way, despite having no education beyond high school and not having any prior work experience to put on a resume/application due to every job they’d ever had ending in either being let go or them quitting without proper notice. They always said they would be interested in college classes but never made any steps towards enrolling or even deciding what major they’d want to go into, even when I offered to get them in contact with the local community college so they could at least get started on completing their general courses. 

After a few months of this, including them completely blowing off our first anniversary by just laying in bed and refusing to even go out to dinner with me somewhere casual, my treat, I had a serious talk with them and they finally admitted they wanted to go back home. So we packed up all their stuff and drove her back to her parents house across the country. I, again, paid for all the gas, hotels, food, and drove a good portion. We agreed to stay together and continue long distance as we had done before. 

Well, it wasn’t long before I decided that since my partner wouldn’t move to where I lived, I’d move to where they lived. I’ve always been kind of a mentally unstable, “grass is always greener on the other side”, “I’ll do anything for love” kind of person, so I guess I kind of just convinced myself there was no reason to stay where I was anymore. I had spent so much time wrapped up in the relationship and working long hours at my job and also, admittedly, just being really lazy and unmotivated, that I failed or dropped a lot of my classes I needed to get into my major program (separate from standard admission into the school) so I transferred my credits to one of the only schools in my state that had a completely online program for my major (no schools in my partners state would accept my transfer credits, at least not according to a few sites I used). I also convinced myself that the job I had was going nowhere and, while it was okay money and I didn’t hate the work I was doing, it wasn’t my dream job and I knew I could find something else I enjoyed just as much or even more in the area my partner lived in. Plus, at that point, I had a good few years of work experience under my belt and left on good terms with my previous employers and co workers, so I knew I’d have good references to fall back on. 

I got rid of my beloved ferrets. I still regret it but I made sure they went to a good home with a family that had other ferrets and would be able to shower them in love and attention. I felt like they deserved better then me, I spent all my time working or in classes and besides, my partner tolerated them and even liked them on some occasions, but I knew if me and them had a future together, the ferrets had to go. And that alone made me undeserving of being their pet mama. I should have fought for them, they had been there for me throughout the hardest times of my young adult life, but I didn’t stand by them when it mattered most and it still haunts me, but I made my choice and now I have to deal with it.  

As for my family and very few friends, I convinced myself they wouldn’t miss me and I wouldn’t miss them. In my mind, everything was going to be better because I’d be with my love, my everything. My partner never asked me to do any of this, I did it all willingly. Their parents offered to let me live with them in their home rent free while we saved money to get our own place. I started my job search while I was still living in my home state and by the time I had put in my notice at my current job, I had a job offer I’d accepted for a position I was really excited about in my partners home state. I met via Zoom with my new academic advisor at the new university I’d be starting online classes through and registered for fall classes. I was all set to start new. My partner, at this point, still did not have a job and was not in school and seemingly had no intentions of doing either. But I stupidly thought that, once I was out there, I could help them and they would change. 

So why did I stay with them? Why was I doing this, uprooting my whole life for someone I’d been with for not even a year and a half? Because even though there were some things that were wrong, everything still felt so right, and there were moments they would really show how much they cared and loved me in ways no else could or would. One of the biggest examples is that they flew out, on my dime but regardless, to help me move. Yes, I helped them move out to me and then back to their parents, but I had a whole apartments worth of things to pack and then load into my pretty small car, and at one point I had a mental breakdown because moving is triggering for me and I shut down, so my partner had to take over. They are the only reason everything got packed and arranged perfectly in my car. They were kind but firm with telling me no when I wanted to take something that wasn’t necessary and also couldn’t fit in my car. They hugged me and we took a break when I’d start to cry. I couldn’t have done it without them. 

When we finally got to their parents, they all helped me unload my car and I discovered that, although I was obviously welcome to be in my partners room when I wanted, I also had a whole room to myself (one of my partners siblings old room) which was so nice and thoughtful of their parents. I was welcomed and treated very nicely. I started my new job after about a week, and although it had its challenges due to the nature of the work I was doing, I was enjoying it. Everything with my partner seemed to be going ok relationship wise, although we started to settle into a routine that I came to hate and resent. I worked everyday, Monday through Saturday, and during this time, they stayed in the basement playing video games and working on researching niche subjects for fun, which I always encouraged because not only did it make them happy but I believed it could eventually be useful in some way, but not in the way they do it, as this wasn’t for a class or a grade or even money. I asked them and they weren’t even planning for any of their work to be compiled for future academic use. Which is fine, hobbies for enjoyment without any other motive is a good thing, but when it’s objectively the only productive thing you’re doing, you gotta kinda take a step back and examine what you’re doing with your life. 

Long story short, I was trying to juggle doing classes full time with working a demanding job that worked with demanding clients and it got to the point where I developed a drinking problem as a coping skill. This is something my partner encouraged inadvertently, as they have a drinking problem as well and had for years before we met. I broke down one day in January 2023 in the middle of their parents kitchen and I cried to my partners mom about how I didn’t know what I was doing at my job and how I felt like I wasn’t making progress with my clients, even after switching to working for a new agency that I thought would be better attuned to my skill set. My partners mom was so sweet and told me that I could quit my job if I felt it was best and just focus on school and that I didn’t need to worry about them thinking less of me (something I mentioned while I was crying).

I hardly remember January 2023-September 2023 honestly, it was all a big blur. I pretty much just laid in bed and neglected all my classes due to being depressed and dissociating. I drank at least one 750ml bottle of vodka nearly everyday and smoked a bunch (or vaped, should I say, as it’s legal in my partners state and I’d buy carts from the dispensary) and was just miserable. I was also having a lot of physical pain and I’d go to the ER a few times a month thinking I had chest pain or because my stomach hurt. During this time, my partner barely noticed. I’d lay in bed all day and at maybe 9, 10 at night they would text me for the first time all day, when we lived in the same house. I’m not saying it was their duty to check on me or something, but I was drowning in my own sorrow and depression and when the roles were reversed, I got them help and made sure they went back home safe. I’m not saying I deserve a medal for that, I just was hoping for the same treatment to be returned to me when I so clearly needed it. 

Since I had no income but still had expenses (car payment, car insurance, phone bill, food for myself while I was hidden away in the room) I maxed out all my credit cards, spent my very small savings, pawned everything I had that was worth money aside from my iPhone, and trashed my room because I was too depressed and in pain to get up and clean it. I would wake up in my own dried vomit almost everyday and I slept close to 20 hours a day most days. At some point during this, my partner got their job back at the place they worked at before we got together. I assumed they were saving their paychecks since their parents paid all their bills (phone and car insurance) and didn’t charge either of us rent, but they only worked 4 hour shifts on the weekends (by their choice, that’s all they wanted to work) so it wasn’t a ton of money to begin with and they’d drink it all or spend it on fast food. I wanted to say something but I felt like a hypocrite since I didn’t even have a job and had not only spent all my money but was going into debt buying alcohol and doordashing food several times a week. So I just let them do whatever they wanted and they did the same to me. 


Everything all came to a head in August of 2023 when my dad and I went on a trip to my favorite city to see one of my favorite musical artists preform live. And I felt nothing. I just couldn’t feel happy. Everything was perfect and all I could see was darkness. My dad noticed and tried to get me to talk to him but I didn’t want to worry him because he’s getting old and has health problems of his own to worry about, so I told him I was just feeling a little down and maybe just needed to look into getting my medications adjusted, which was a lie on multiple levels since I hadn’t seen a therapist or been on medications since I lived in my home state. I was just letting myself be miserable and that made me hate myself even more. I was turning into everything I hated about my partner. 

A few days after I got home from my trip, I was having intense thoughts of hurting myself and decided to go to the hospital so I wouldn’t hurt myself, since it was all I wanted to do but I couldn’t do that to my dad and my partner and their parents, especially not in their home. I was gone all day and laid in a hospital room waiting to get transported to another hospital where they had a psych wing. My partner finally texted me at around 9, 10pm asking where I was. I told them the truth, and of course they were concerned then, but by that time, I had to give my phone up and I called her from the psych hospital the next morning. 

I spent a few days in the hospital and it essentially did nothing but keep me physically safe. They discharged me with a one month supply of medications but no prescription or resources for establishing follow up care. It just so happened that my partner was working on the day I was released from the hospital, so their mom came to pick me up. We didn’t talk much during the drive home, but she was very sweet and didn’t seem mad at all, which I wasn’t expecting due to the fact that I probably worried their child for days and they probably had to hear all about it. 

Shortly after that, me and my partner got our own apartment because their parents were moving out of the house and into a new house a few hours away to start their (semi) retirement years. My partner had no money saved up from working, and the money they had in their savings account was for when they wanted to go back to school someday, so since I had just gotten a large settlement payment, I paid for the deposit and first months rent in full at our new apartment. Because my partners parents are angels and truly the kindest, most generous people I’ve ever had the fortune of knowing, not only did my partners father co-sign for us to get our apartment (my partner didn’t have enough income to qualify and I still didn’t have a job, although at this point I’d snapped out of my funk a bit and was applying to places left and right and even had a few interviews during the time when we were moving) but they offered to help us with rent for a year. 

What ended up happening is where the issues really started getting bad. I spent all my settlement money on buying things for the apartment and paying the remaining rent and utilities after applying the money my partners parents would give us monthly. During this time, my partner paid $0 towards rent, utilities, groceries, or any other bills. They also did zero chores. Yes, they were still working at this time, but they were on thin ice with their employer and started having the very few shifts they were regularly scheduled for (4 hours every Saturday and Sunday) because they kept calling out last minute and being an hour late to their shifts for no reason. I was still trying to get a job and end eventually got one in November 2023. 

It was truly an awful job with awful hours (16 hours shifts back to back) and awful pay but it was money. I was working with a difficult clientele once again and it was truly an awful horrible experience. I also had to commute 45 minutes each way at 6am and 11:30pm in the dark and cold. During this time, I was still paying for everything, minus the money my partners parents sent to go towards rent each month, and also doing all the chores and household things like grocery shopping and replenishing things that were getting low/running out, like dish soap, paper towels, etc. It was truly exhausting and I really really resented my partner during this time, especially because it seemed like I had changed my entire life multiple times to try and be better for us and our future, and they were getting to stay the exact same. 

To make things worse, my partner got fired from their job in December because they called out randomly last minute on their Christmas Eve shift and the owner said he was sick of not having someone reliable. My partner openly said “I’m going to wait a while to find a new job” and no matter how much I told them they needed to at least LOOK for one, they refused. 

In February of this year, I found a new job that I LOVED. I was making more money, had a steady set schedule working hours I loved, and I was doing work I was passionate about. Things were finally kind of looking up. I finally felt a small spark inside of me light up again, I felt like I could be proud of myself again, like I wasn’t a total loser with no life. I threw myself into my job and being the best employee I could be, working extra shifts that were open, really trying to connect with the population I served, trying to get along with my co workers and boss. 

Then in May, I realized I had missed my period. I’m pretty regular and I’d also been feeling really off and needing to pee a lot, so I took a pregnancy test in the bathroom at work because I thought I was being ridiculous. I was pregnant. After my shift, I went to a nearby 24 hour grocery store and bought three more tests, and all of them were positive. Call me stupid, but while I was really scared and shocked, I was also….excited. Me and my partner had talked at length from the very beginning about how we wanted kids, and even though this wasn’t the optimal time, I had a good job and I really hoped that this would make my partner get a job and finally we could move into the next part of our lives.

Needless to say, that isn’t what happened. When I first told them, they managed to seem empathetic. I brought up how I know I always thought I’d get an abortion if I got pregnant accidentally, but I wasn’t entirely sure now. I saw a dark storm cloud pass over my partners face but they managed to compose themselves and say “well, think about it.” A few days later, I come to them and say I’m still not sure about aborting and how I think we could do it if we really tried, especially since I was still really early on in the pregnancy at that point so we would have many months to figure things out. The person I saw before me in that moment was NOT my partner, or at least not a version of them I’d ever seen before. They didn’t get “mad” but just very…stern? Almost as if they were reprimanding a small child or someone so dumb they couldn’t understand basic words. I don’t remember all of what was said, since I think even in the moment I was blocking a lot of it out for my own protection, but basically they tried to guilt me by saying “you said if this ever happened you’d get an abortion” and then saying “what are my parents gonna think?”

I acknowledged from the very beginning that I kn ow I’d originally thought I’d want to abort, and I truly really thought that it would be that cut and dry, but for some reason I just was having a really hard time with the decision. And instead of seeing that and trying to be any kind of sympathetic or empathetic, my partner just yelled at me and tried to guilt me. Also, just to note, it’s not like we had the conversation of “if I get pregnant I’ll get an abortion” very often, and also, the two most recent times we had unprotected sex that most likely led to me getting pregnant were both when I was pretty much blackout drunk and they were stone cold sober, so anything I said while in that state, I don’t remember and I think it’s really egregious that they would hold me to that without even understanding my side. 

Regardless, I understood that I wasn’t going to win with this. After a barrage of text messages I got from them while I was at work that night (basically just saying the same thing, how I promised I’d get an abortion and I needed to keep my promise) I did research on abortions in my area. Luckily, they are pretty easily accessible in the state my partner is from, and I was early enough in the pregnancy that I could get a pill abortion. I wanted to get it from a clinic in person though because I wanted to make sure everything went right, so I made the appointment to be in person just a few days later. 

I went alone. My partner didn’t offer to come with me and I didn’t ask. I went after I got off of work and drove about an hour to the place because it was the cheapest but most reputable clinic I could find. They did an ultrasound on me and couldn’t for certain see the fetus, although they thought they could see the sac very faintly. They gave me another pregnancy test and it was still positive so they wanted me to come back the next week to see if they could see something then. I cried all the way home and just knew this was a sign I should keep the pregnancy, but I knew I couldn’t. Or maybe I could have, but I was once again a coward, not willing to fight for something I wanted because it wasn’t what my partner wanted. But in this case, it felt a little different, since it’s also their baby, and if they don’t want it, what kind of person would I be keeping it, knowing the baby would no matter what have an absent parent? I was still also feeling guilt over having promised my partner I’d abort if this ever happened, so I tried to brush aside any thoughts I had that I should keep it. 

I went back the next week, alone, again, and I went right after work. They were able to see the fetus this time and determined I was just barely six weeks along. They gave me the pills I needed to take and told me what to expect. The abortion cost $500 and I had to use my credit card I’d just paid off because I didn’t have the cash. I went home and did what I was supposed to. I was supposed to have the weekend off but someone called out the next night and so I went in to work wearing an adult diaper under my clothes and hoped no one noticed. I cried in the bathroom during the downtimes. 

I got promoted to supervisor at work a month later and that kind of led to my downfall. My partner still didn’t have a job, wasn’t even applying for places because, once again, nothing was good enough for them. I was working roughly 50-60 hours a week while only being paid for 40 of them, because being supervisor required all these meetings and trainings and being on call for if one of my direct reports couldn’t come in for a shift they signed up for. Not even mentioning some issues I was having with one of my direct reports being insubordinate and calling out all the time and upper management dragging their feet on writing her up or firing her. 

In September of this year, I had a massive mental breakdown under all the pressure and I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital. Before I went, I sent my partner my last $200 so they could buy cat food/litter (we finally got two kitties in June after the abortion because my partner felt a little bad and knew I needed it after the loss) and groceries because I didn’t know how long I was gonna be gone. I wasn’t expecting this, nor did I ask for this, but everyday I was in the hospital, my partner came to visit me. During this time, we laughed, played games they brought for us to play, ate food they brought for me, and it was honestly the most supportive and loving they had been in months. I’m still not sure what made her do that, because even though I know she loves me, it seemed a little out of character for them to come EVERY day, as they usually would go days without leaving the apartment and hated human interaction. But I was glad for her coming, as it gave me something to look forward to every day. 

The nurse practitioner I saw while I was in the hospital got me back on medications and recommended I participate in an outpatient program at the day hospital when I was discharged. I agreed and I did that for two weeks after being discharged. While I was doing the outpatient program, two things happened. The first was that I had to be sober because they wanted to see how the medications were working for me and substances would get in the way of the medications effectiveness. Secondly, I talked at length with a psychiatrist that told me that the symptoms I was experiencing and the feelings I had described to him didn’t fit my previous diagnosis but instead pointed to a different, more difficult to treat mental disorder. I won’t go into details because I really don’t want to, but it made a lot of sense to me and it kind of broke me in a way, because not only does this disorder have a horrible reputation but it’s the same one my abusive, explosive mother was suspected to have but she refused to be evaluated so we’ll never know. 

Throughout this, my partner attempted to be supportive, but honestly, I came to realize that they had never needed to be emotionally or otherwise consistently supportive for another person ever. They grew up with healthy parents that didn’t emotionally or otherwise rely on their children, so they never had to care for their parents like I did growing up. And I’m so glad for them for that, since it’s a horrible thing to have happen, but since my partner has also isolated themselves in terms of friendships or other family relationships, they don’t have the skill of emotionally supporting someone that I or most people have developed as either children or adults. And they weren’t willing to learn either, mostly because I’d made them believe the very minimal effort they put forth was enough, when it wasn’t even close to the bare minimum between two adult partners, especially given how much I’d given in the relationship. 

After the outpatient program ended, I was supposed to go back to work. Since I’d communicated with my boss and HR throughout this whole process, they were willing to work with me and kept my job open through my treatment. But in addition to feeling mentally unwell, I was also starting to feel physically sick again and found myself going back to the ER for various ailments I was convinced were life threatening and it pushing me to the brink of insanity again. I decided to resign from my position before they were forced to fire me. 

When this happened was when my partner FINALLY decided to start applying to jobs. But they were still being very very picky on the kinds of jobs they were applying for and also, I only just found out, they were completely BOMBING the very few interviews they did get. Which honestly, shouldn’t have been surprising to me, but it was a little surprising that they thought answering the question “Can you explain the gap in your job history?” with “oh I was living at home with my parents and didn’t need a job” was appropriate. 

So that brings us to now. I’ve been trying to apply to a few part time or seasonal jobs since I lost my job officially, but my mental and physical well-being hasn’t really improved and I’ve been drinking a lot again to deal with it all. The little bit of money I had from already scheduled vacation time I got paid out from work has run out so now I don’t have money and neither does my partner, although NOW they are digging into their savings, since they’d rather do that I guess than get a job. Their parents paid this months rent in full, which I didn’t want to accept but had no choice. I thanked them profusely. 

I’ve been pulling away from my partner the last few days because I decided I’m breaking up with them and moving back to my home state. I have no plan for when I get there, I don’t even have the money for the gas it would take to get there, but I’ll borrow it from my dad if need be or sell my laptop. A friend in the area gave me the number for an organization that helps young people find housing and what not, and I could get a job at one of my old employers and save money while I live in my car, which is thankfully paid off at this point. I don’t know how I’ll afford insurance for it but I guess I just have to hope I don’t get pulled over at any point and I’ll be good. 

I just know I can’t stay here. I’m planning on having coffee with my partners mom tomorrow to tell her what I’m planning so they can be prepared that their child is going to ask to come live with them again and also so they can help keep them safe, since my partner has expressed to me many times, mostly while intoxicated but a few times while stone cold sober, that they would end their own life if we couldn’t be together. I just want my partner to be safe, no matter what has happened, I don’t want them to hurt themselves. 

I also want to offer to pay my partners parents back for everything they have done for us financially. I don’t want them to think I’m ungrateful or don’t acknowledge all they have done for us. So I want to offer to pay them back in installments once I get a job again. I feel bad I’m going to be ruining their newfound freedom in their retired life but I can’t do this anymore. I know the blame is mostly mine in all this happening, but no matter whose fault, I can’t do it anymore. I can’t stay here. Our lease ends at the end of December and we were gonna sign for another year, but I can’t do it. 

I won’t be able to take the cats with me, which makes me feel so so awful and breaks my heart, and I just hope my partner doesn’t get rid of them. The cats deserve better then us, they deserve better then me, but I don’t want them back in the shelter especially because while they are still young they aren’t little kittens anymore and who knows how long it’ll take for them to be adopted. Maybe I’ll try to find a good home for them before I leave if my partner says they will get rid of them, but I still feel horrible and like such a shitty pet parent. I know at this point I don’t deserve animals and I probably won’t get another pet after this. 

I feel so horrendously awful that this how this is ending. Almost 4 years, and this is it. The hardest part is just walking away. I always thought we would be forever and if we could just go back to the magic we had at the beginning, before we really knew each other, before we had to live in reality, or rather, before they refused to and I had to for the both of us, I’d stay forever. But nothings gonna make them change, not me being pregnant with their child, not me crying and begging, not me being so physically and mentally sick that I had to go to the hospital and lose my job I loved so much. Nothing. Everything’s gonna have to change for me just so it can stay painfully the same for them. And I get that now. 

I haven’t told my partner any of this yet, I’m waiting to talk to their mom tomorrow so that she can be on standby in case they threaten to off themselves or hurt themselves. I have no idea what’s going to happen or how they are going to react. My biggest fear, aside from them hurting themselves over the news, is that I won’t be able to go through with it. That I’ll do what I’ve done before, that I’ll go to say all this to them, and I’ll look into their eyes and be so overcome with how much I do still love them that I won’t be able to do it. 

But I just need to remind myself that this is good. And even though it sucks that I’m going to have to change in such a big way again just for them to be able to go back to how they were for the first 32 years of their life, living at home with their parents, playing video games and doing what they want all day, this will be the last time I’ll ever have to do it. 

I just hope I can get myself some of myself back while also keeping some of the happiness being with my partner gave me in the beginning. Because we were happy at one point, and I know all of what I’ve said makes it sound like it was all miserable. I just have compassion fatigue at this point and the rose colored sunglasses I’ve seen them through all these years have lost their tint. I also am just so tired that being loved and loving someone isn’t something I’m willing to give my whole self for anymore.

i don't mind if anyone else uses my coffee maker (why would i?), i usually just ask new people to please turn it off when they're done.

my family however seem to have an issue? i *have* explained more than once that it *does not work,* i have even *demonstrated* to my parents that it will stay on. but every time i am met with the *same* answer- ""there's an auto off feature, just turn it on"". i then re-tell them it stopped working so i turned it off. then the conversation either turns cyclical, or they just get sort of...weird, shut down or completely change the subject? it's largely my parents, though others do it too. i have ***never*** raised my voice or been aggressive about it. it's a fucking *coffee maker,* i *know* it's not that big of a deal.

...but it makes me feel like i'm fucking crazy. the way that the conversation goes the same way *every* time. the fact that both of my parents have *seen* it not shut off when the feature is *visibly turned on*. but it always just goes back to them pretending i never said anything *immediately.* this is not a new thing- it has been an occasional happening for *years.* it's not every day, but i've noticed it happening a bit more frequently as of late. i almost feel like i'm being fucking gaslit.

i know there will be one question asked- there's 2 reasons i would like it turned off:

\- it's not good for electronics to be left on all the time. my dad in particular *knows* this- he built *computers* for a living and has worked with technology his entire life.

*-* a relevant quirk of our house is that small kitchen appliances cannot be used at the same time or it blows a fuse- microwave, coffee maker, etc. on their own? fine, but for example you can't run a kettle and coffee maker simultaneously. it's the heat that causes it. so a coffee maker that's *constantly* on, heating water, is gonna cause an issue sooner or later.

here's why i might be TA:

\- i *know* it's a super small thing. my coffee maker will not explode and stop working if it's left on for a bit. i just want to preserve it as best i can. but i might be making a mountain out of a molehill and should just shut up and turn it off without saying a word.

\- i know it's hitting personal wounds. i've been infantilized, treated like i don't know anything, like i'm stupid, irrational, and unreasonable by an overwhelming majority of people in my life. not my sisters- i'm really close to them, and i feel like they're the only ones that *get* me. but parents, other family members, ex friends/partners, even teachers and school staff. feeling not listened to is hitting sensitive nerves, and i know that might be why i feel like this.",3,1731366819.0,AmItheAsshole,15,0.66,False
1gp68ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/1gp68ck/coffee_shop_cafe_for_10_people/,Coffee Shop / Cafe for 10 people? ,"Hi all,

I’m traveling to the Manhattan area in December to host an event for my company. There will be between 10 and 15 people, and I have to take them all out for coffee. Problem is is that I am worried about getting enough table space for 10-15 people. I don’t want to walk in and not have there be any room for us to sit. That would wind up being pretty embarrassing on my part. 
So my question is: do you have any suggestions for coffee shops or cafés that I could reserve table space for about an hour, or coffee shops that don’t have a lot of foot traffic? I was thinking something like a Starbucks or a Panera bread but I know in more urban settings they tend to limit the seating. thank you! ",1,1731366772.0,manhattan,6,0.67,False

After we said our goodbyes I decided to take a stroll through Benson, the neighborhood where we frequented as 20-somethings. I stumbled into The Edge of the Universe coffee shop, which at the time was an immersive experience to look like van Gogh paintings. It was so beautiful, down to every last detail. The barista told me it was temporary, and explained the owners pick a new theme every so many months.

Flash-forward to Nov. 1, 2024. I needed to get some stuff from my mom but suffered a back injury and couldn't walk, AKA shop, all day. We planned a low-key weekend, including time spent in a coffee shop. I knew the **perfect** place. I drove my Western Nebraskan, much-more-Conservative-than-me, practicing Catholic mom to Benson. I told her all about this immersive concept coffee shop and how cool it is, wondering what the latest theme would be.

I did not look at Edge of the Universe's social media ahead of time. Did I know what kind of neighborhood Benson is (liberal and hip)? Hell yes! Did I know Halloween was two days before? Yes of course but did I **consider** that Halloween was **two days before?** No, no I did not. Could I have predicted what Edge of the Universe would look like if I had stopped and thought about it **for one goddamn second?** Probably. Did I stop to do that? Nope.

So the goats outside were a hint. And I walked my Conservative Catholic mother right into the black, dark coffee shop with an ouija board right up front. Whoops! I stammered to my mom, who was wondering why I talked up this place to her of all people. We ended up across the street. 

This is not a rant TO the coffee shop because, as stated, may fault! I'm still just laughing at the sit-com level moment, and I promise I'll be back. Also, I LOVE a Halloween pop-up so I can tell if I'd gone solo, the experience would have been 10/10. Well done, EOtU. See you next time. Maybe I can convince my mom to give it another try 😂.

1gp672n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gp672n/why_do_my_relationships_get_so_sexual/,"why do my ""relationships"" get so sexual?","I (24F) dated for 4.5 years, between 19 and 24. We lived together for the last 2 years of the relationship, but it wasn't working out for a long time. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. Our sex life was never extraordinary, we still didn't know exactly what we liked. In the last couple of months, we had sex less than once a month.

After we broke up, I moved to another country and I've been here since April last year. I even fell in love again for a brief period, but I realized that I'm not ready for the responsibility of a relationship again. In recent times, I've met and gone out with several guys. Some were worth it, some weren't, some ghosted me, with others the conversation just didn't continue. In recent months I've discovered myself to be a big hornyhead, and I often get taken in by it. I'm not complaining - I'm quite lucky with sexual partners, at least in comparisson with many other women's experiences with men.

The big problem is that, in most cases, once we get sexual - and this happens relatively quickly because, tbh, that's what I expect from people I meet on dating apps and that's what i am mainly looking for - my relationship with these guys becomes *only* that. There's no more initiative on their part to suggest some quality time, going for a coffee, having dinner, walking around the city, nothing. It's just *we can enjoy some wine at mt place hehe* or some other proposal that means: I just want to fuck. But, well... I go. If I also want to have sex, ~~after having someone to listen to me yapping,~~ which is often the case, I accept. Maybe it's my mistake for being so available?

I don't feel wrong or anything about enjoying casual sex, but I do miss having a partner to spend time and then hook up with. And yes, I tell them that I expect a bit more than just sex when we start talking, but I think they just choose to ignore that part, after all, it's not very difficult for me to say yes after being asked out on a mediocre date. often having a few glasses of wine, smoking a few cigarettes and getting laid is all that happens. Again, I don't feel forced into anything, I guess I just wish I had the option of being able to do more than that.

Anyway, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. Sexually satisfied, but emotionally a little upset. I think part of it is that I still have few friends here, so I put my hopes of going out and doing something nice in the guys I meet. But at the same time, come on, my standards are too low, it's not expecting too much to hang out with that person before he's going to fuck me. or is it? I would say it's even polite.

It's never much, let's do a hypothetical of 4 tablespoons of coffee in 200gr of chocolate, something that was mentioned in a chocolate mousse recipe I was skimming earlier.

Are you able to taste the coffee in the finished product, or does it just enhance the chocolate flavour without tasting of coffee?

It was only 6 days and I developed a crush quickly. We got close. We met up for coffee a week later before she started working the job she has now. And then we spent 4 months just talking through instagram. No flirting, but a lot of talking about hanging out which finally happened last week. She actually initiated for a dine-in movie where she works. I looked my absolute best so I hope I made a good impression.

Now, this is where she muted me. It was about a month after having coffee in the summer. We had been talking and then she posts hanging out with a guy. Now I did some snooping, and they were together but i dont know if they are still together or just friends with some feelings there. After this story post - i didnt message her for a couple days. And thats around the time i found out i got muted from seeing her stories. I was liking all her stories (not replying) but didnt like her story with the guy. Is that why? Was she already bothered by me even though we just started talking? Does she not want me to see her stuff with the guy and thus keeping me around and interested?

I don't know. I really don't. She's been down for anything - amusement park, movies, rooftop movies, and other 'just us' stuff. She has never mentioned having a boyfriend to me. So what do you think? Should i just ask her why? Perhaps not ask why but apologize for anything i may have done to warrant that or just earn that privilege back? She still sees my stories and again, looks to hang out with me again and talks normally to me with emoji's.

i don't try to have a deep conversation with her as she's a bit of a slow texter and i prefer to leave that to in person meet ups. I mean, she definitely likes me as a friend. She's opened up to me about some things. idk, maybe she's just too nice and i cant take a hint? help me out guys

a part of me is delusional and hopeful that theres a chance that this guy got her phone and muted me and she just never checked her mute list. ",1,1731366447.0,Instagram,1,1.0,False
1gp63p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gp63p3/ro_you_forgot_me/,[RO] You Forgot Me,"Skylar always felt most at home at the theater. Especially after her accident. Five years of her life, gone from her memory in the blink of an eye, all because some idiot decided to drive home drunk.



The theater was more than happy to have her back on set design once she’d recovered physically. And Skylar got her bit of normalcy from the theater. It was the same old building she’d gone to throughout her childhood. She’d been volunteering there for years before her accident. Probably since she was sixteen. The stage was the same, the old leather seats, even the people were the same. Each year always had new additions though, so it wasn’t unusual when she had to meet new people on her first day back, even if they did remember her from before.



“Hey.” Skylar approached another woman on her first day back. Something about the woman felt familiar. It was strange. With most of the people she’d met in the past five years she had no recollection of them.

 

Skylar stuck her hand out towards the woman. “Were we friends before? I feel like I know you.” The woman stared at her for an awkward ten seconds before cautiously taking her hand and giving it a brief shake, dropping it immediately.

 

“Yeah, you could say that.” The woman searched Skylar’s face, looking for something that wasn’t there. “I’m Tessa,” she eventually grumbled. “Nice to re-meet you.” And with that she was gone, walking out the theater door until their next rehearsal.

 

Weeks went by and Skylar continued to adjust back at work. It took some getting used to when people she just met already knew a lot about her. Everyone was so welcoming and understanding though. They’d spend every spare moment telling Skylar about themselves and their relationship with Skylar during the forgotten years.

 

Everyone, except Tessa. The tall, dark-haired woman avoided Skylar at all costs. And Skylar couldn’t figure out why. Something about it really bothered her. Everyone she asked about Tessa gave her the same answer: Tessa joined the theater as a tech four years ago, she was close with Skylar before the accident.

 

Her parents outright refused to talk about Tessa at all, blowing off whatever friendship they had as the equivalent to having an assigned partner in school who you talk to, but don’t stay in contact with once the class is over. They’d tell her it was better that the other woman wasn’t taking to her anymore, claiming she always seemed stuck up anyways. Then they’d ask her if she’d met any cute women recently who she may be interested in, encouraging her to “get out there.”

 

But Rodger, Skylar’s best friend, wouldn’t put up with what her parents described, and he worked closely with the techs when it came to planning out effects. Nothing was adding up and it frustrated Skylar that no one would just tell her the truth. It frustrated her even more that trying to remember on her own would simply lead to frequent headaches.

 

On the day of the dress rehearsal everything was going well. Tessa was stowed away in her booth making sure her program ran smoothly, queuing the soundtracks in sync with the lighting changes, and Skylar was in the audience, watching her team’s elaborately painted house get wheeled in a circle to display the forest on the other side.

 

Occasionally, when the stage lights were low enough to see past, she’d look up and find Tessa watching her from the window of her booth. It had happened a lot throughout the seven months they’d been working on the set. Her friends had told her she must’ve been mistaken, but Rodger didn’t seem surprised when she brought it up. He’d told her that, like everyone said, she and Tessa had been close. It was hard to lose that. He never had an answer when she’d asked why not just get to know her again like everyone else. He’d just looked at her sadly and said it was more difficult for Tessa.

 

That night though, Tessa’s gaze felt different. Sadder than before. This time, she didn’t look away when Skylar caught her staring.

 

After the rehearsal ended, the director, Sharron, made her usual announcements. “Oh, and sorry to end on a sad note, but I’ve been informed that Tessa will not be returning to us for our next show.”

 

“What?” Daryl’s eyes went wide. He snapped his head toward Tessa who gave him an apologetic grimace. “You’re leaving?”

 

“Gonna miss me or something?” Tessa teased her fellow tech.

 

“You can’t leave me! If you go, I’ll have to go back to manually operating the lights!”

 

“You’ll survive, I promise.” Tessa smiled, but it didn’t fully reach her eyes; it never did, as far as Skylar could tell.

 

Skylar looked to Rodger to gauge his reaction, but he was just staring at Tessa with a pitying look.

 

Once dismissed, Skylar collected her things and went to find Rodger. She walked down the hall to where they usually meet, but he was nowhere to be seen. That was weird. She backtracked down the hall until she heard hushed voices coming from one of the offices.

 

Hearing Rodger’s voice, she crept closer to listen. “You can’t just leave,” her friend said.

 

“I can’t deal with another day with her, much less months.” That voice was Tessa. She sounded frustrated, almost angry. “I thought I’d be fine, but being around her is killing me.”

 

“So, just talk to her,” Rodger reasoned.

 

“And say what? She doesn’t remember.” This was definitely about Skylar then. “And I’m not going to go brining up stupid shit that didn’t matter.”

 

“It wasn’t stupid,” Rodger immediately argued, “and it did matter.”

 

Tessa paused at that, eventually saying under her breath, “Yeah, well. Not anymore.”

 

Footsteps approached the door. Skylar quickly ducked into the closest office and hid until they both left, Tessa returning to the main area and Rodger’s heavier footsteps heading toward the back door he was supposed to meet Skylar at. Skylar waited a minute and then followed Rodger.

 

The drive home was filled with casual conversation until Skylar randomly asked, “Is she mad at me for something?”

 

Rodger glanced at her from behind the wheel. “What?” He sounded concerned. “Is who mad at you?”

 

She gave him a look that said they both knew damn well who. “Tessa. Did we have an argument before my accident? Is that why she’s avoiding me?”

 

Rodger sighed heavily. “It’s just-”

 

“Hard for her,” Skylar huffed. “I know. You keep saying that.” She sifted sideways in her seat, so she was facing him. “But why? Why not even try to reconnect with me?”

 

He pulled up to a red light, using the opportunity to look over at her. “I don’t know, Sky,” he admitted, using the nickname only he and her family ever used. “Just give her space. Maybe she’ll come around.”

 

Rodger refocused on the road when the light turned green. The rest of the drive was silent.

 

The next time they went to the theater was for the first show. Skylar made a point to try to talk to Tessa, but Tessa was being extra careful to never be in the same room as Skylar. She eventually gave up and decided to back down.

 

By the end of the third night, Skylar had only seen Tessa from a distance when everyone was forced into the same room before they divided up to start the performances.

 

“Afterparty tonight, you coming?” Julie, one of the actresses, asked.

 

“Wouldn’t miss it.” Skylar grinned. She’d always loved the parties at the end of their showing nights when they celebrated all their hard work.

 

“Hell yeah!” Julie beamed back at her, clapping her on the back before heading off to her dressing room.

 

The show went on without a stitch. The automated curtains opened and closed exactly on que. The light show was synced perfectly with the change in mood as each scene went by. Looking at the stage, you’d never know the chaotic rehearsals that led to the actors’ and actresses’ perfect performances.

 

At the afterparty, Skylar was surprised to see Tessa enter the giant room. She hadn’t come to any of the events after the last few showings.

 

“You made it!” Julie, already a little tipsy, ran up and hugged Tessa.

 

“I made her.” Daryl said from beside Tessa. “Can’t miss her last afterparty!”

 

“Oh, that’s right!” Julie screamed in Tessa’s ear. “I can’t believe you’re leaving!” Tessa gave a small laugh. “I get it though,” Julie said, still loud, but her voice more somber for that last part.

 

Tessa’s expression turned grim. Before she could say anything, Daryl jostled her shoulders. “Let’s go get some food.” From what Skylar could tell, it looked like Daryl was distracting Tessa on purpose. He shot Julie a look as soon as Tessa looked away.

 

It was like some big inside joke everyone knew about except Skylar. They all understood Tessa’s reasons and sympathized, but no one would tell Skylar. And based on the conversation she’d heard the day before, it all had something to do with her.

 

A big commotion at the door drew everyone’s eyes. “Now, may I announce our royal party,” Patrick, one of the actors, called out once he had the room’s attention, “The Duke and the Princess.”

 

The doors burst open and in paraded the lead actor and actress of the show. Everyone began cheering as the two gave exaggerated bows and waved as royalty would to peasants, still playing the part of their characters even in their casual clothes.

 

“M’ lady,” George said in a heavy old English accent. He dropped to his knee and pulled out the ring Giana’s character wore in the show. “Would you do me the honor of being my bride?” It’s a scene that’s implied to happen after the end of the show.

 

Giana gasped. “Why, this is so unexpected.” She fanned herself dramatically. “But I must decline. I’ve fallen for another.”

 

“Yeah, take that Duke.” Michael said, stepping up to Giana and wrapping his arms around his wife.

 

George gasped. “An affair?” He clutched his chest. “How ever will I move on?”

 

The bit went on, but Skylar stopped paying attention to it after she noticed Tessa’s face. Everyone was laughing along with the show, but Tessa was stiff. Skylar couldn’t tell if it was just the lighting, but were her eyes glassy?

 

Tessa then turned and dodged her way through the crowd towards a side door that led into the back hallway.

 

The sight made Skylar incredibly uncomfortable. She took a step in the diction of the door, but a hand wrapped around her arm and held her in place. Rodger looked Skylar dead in the eye, his voice firm as he told her, “Don’t.”

 

But this wasn’t about giving Tessa space anymore. The other woman had truly seemed upset. So, Skylar pulled her arm free and followed Tessa anyways.

 

When she entered the only open office on the hall, finding Tessa leaning over a desk hyperventilating, her fingernails digging into the wood,  was not what she thought she’d find.

 

Tessa’s back was to her, she could still leave. But again, that nagging feeling that made leaving impossible settled in her gut. “Hey, are you ok?” she asked as gently as possible.

 

Tessa jumped upright, turning to see who was behind her. When she saw Skylar, she quickly wiped away some wetness from her cheeks. “I’m fine, you can go.” Tessa was as dismissive as ever when it came to Skylar.

 

But Skylar didn’t let that deter her. “Can I help?”

 

“No. Just leave.”

 

It was then that Skylar’s irritation over the past seven months hit her like a wave. She was tired of being avoided. Of never having answers. Of everyone knowing something about her life that she couldn’t remember. “What did I do to you?” she blurted.

 

Tessa hesitated at that. “What are you talking about?”

 

“I’m talking about how everyone says we were friends before the accident, but you never visited me in the hospital and you’re always avoiding me. Did I do something wrong?”

 

“No.” Tessa’s shoulders slumped. She leaned backwards on the desk.

 

“But you *are* avoiding me. Did we get into a fight before the accident?”

 

“No Sky, it’s nothing like that. Please, just go.”

 

Tessa was growing stiffer, but Skylar was only focused on that nickname. Her voice began to raise. “Sky? You’ve been avoiding me for months, and we were clearly close if you’re calling me Sky, so what did I do to make you so mad at me?”

 

Tessa clenched her jaw. She wouldn’t make eye contact anymore. “Nothing.”

 

“It was obviously something, just tell me.”

 

Then Tessa exploded off where she sat on the desk, storming forward until she was only two feet from Skylar. “You forgot me!” she yelled, her voice cracking.

 

Skylar took a step back, offended by the outburst. “Yeah,” she said, anger now bubbling. “I forgot a lot of people.”

 

“I’m not just people, Sky! I’m *me*! That’s what I’m trying to say!” Tessa stared straight into Skylar’s eyes with a look Skylar could only describe as desperate. Tears began to spill over and slide down her cheeks. “Four years together and you don’t even remember! One day I’m carrying a ring around and the next day the woman I’m supposed to give it to looks at me with the same recognition as someone she passed on the street once! I can’t stand being in the same room as you because it hurts so fucking much when the woman I love more than anything looks at me like she’s getting Deja-Vu!”

 

Tessa finally took a deep breath, as if realizing what she’d said. But Skylar’s mind was already reeling.

 

“A ring?” Skylar took another step back, this time out of shock. “We were together?” She began shaking her head. “No. Someone would’ve told me. If we’d been together for four years, someone would’ve told me.”

 

“Yeah, well I was left out of that decision,” Tessa mumbled, looking anywhere but at Skylar.

 

That made even less sense. “You mean- wait- who-”

 

“Your parents said telling you would confuse you since you wouldn’t remember any of it.” Tessa laughed dryly. “To be honest, they never exactly liked me to begin with.”

 

“No,” Skylar insisted, retreating another step. “They wouldn’t do that. Four years? They couldn’t do that to me.”

 

When Skylar’s voice cracked Tessa’s gaze finally snapped back to her. Her expression softened and she stepped closer to Skylar, reaching out instinctively before catching herself and backing down. “Oh God, I’m sorry. They were right, telling you just made everything worse. It’s fine, don’t worry about it. Just go, I’ll be fine.”

 

But Skylar didn’t want to leave. Despite everything, she felt safer when Tessa had stepped closer to her. So, they stood in silence for many long minutes, both of them processing everything that just happened.

 

Until Skylar finally spoke again, quietly asking, “Do you drink French vanilla coffee?”

 

Tessa, who was leaning on the desk again, glanced up in surprise. “What?”

 

Skylar repeated, “Do you drink French vanilla coffee?”

 

“Yes.” Tessa stared at her in disbelief. “How do you know that?”

 

“I found an empty box in the trash at my apartment when I got home. And it was written on a grocery list like I had planned to get more. But I never liked sweet coffee, so it was weird.”

 

Tessa sat in silence, apparently unsure of how to respond.

 

“And the extra toothbrush. My mom told me that my sister had borrowed it when spending the night right before the accident, but there was a mark on the sink from it and it was worn, like it had been used for more than a few nights. Was that yours too?”

 

Tessa gave a weak smile. “Mine was green and yours was blue. You insisted on us using our favorite colors.”

 

“Wait, is that why there’s a painting made entirely of shades of green on my wall? My signature was on it, but I never liked the color enough to make something like that for me.” Tessa nodded, staring at Skylar in awe for noticing all these little things that represented Tessa in her apartment. “And in my closet, there’s a Virginia Tech sweatshirt. I figured someone might’ve left it by accident at first… but then… I don’t know. This sounds crazy, but when I picked it up, it smelled familiar. Not like me or like the apartment or even my family, but it still felt like... home. Is that yours?”

 

“I thought your parents would’ve thrown it away. They said they were going to clear out anything I left behind.”

 

“I guess they missed it.”

 

“I guess they did.”

 

They fell into silence again, this one more comfortable than the last. Skylar folded her arms protectively across her stomach like she always did before doing something that scared her. “Tessa?” she asked.

 

“Yeah?”

 

Skylar hesitated again, still unsure if this would be a good idea. “I know it won’t bring back my memory or make you forget before, but I fell in love with you once. Do you think, maybe, we could try to start over?”

 

Tessa considered her for a few moments. She looked like she didn’t believe what Skylar had said. “Yeah.” A slow smile grew on Tessa’s face. “I’d really like that.” Tessa held her hand out and, like it was muscle memory, Skylar reached out to grab it. Tessa gave her fingers a gentle squeeze. “Baby steps?”

 

Skylar took a deep breath, inhaling that sweatshirt scent. Finally, she nodded. “Want to start with ice cream?”

 

Tessa grinned, leading Skylar out the door.",1,1731366432.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

My mother and I arrived to the linq 11/8/2024 with no issues however from the kiosk self check in not working and it then couldn't find our reservation forcing us to the reception desk to repeat the check in process twice. We then were shocked to find out about the mandatory $200 plus resort fee that wasn't explained prior to and a $200 deposit. We paid that assuming certain amenities would be included. Our bags were taken to another area and we were told we had to eother pick them up from the area they were placed at or go upstairs and then call for a bell hop to bring our luggage when they are available instead of just accomompanying us to the room like normal.
 The room number was 10134, a ""handicap"" accessible room was located at the furthest left of the hotel entrances known as district 3 on the 10th floor leading to a dimily lit hallway that you can eaaily injure yourselfor stumble in. The room is an okay size but you have to rent a microwave and coffee pot for 30 dollars or 10 dollars a day if they weren't left in the room prior. The closet is halved, the only windo is cieling to floor length with no real view except for the back of another building. The light above the toilet was out and the main reason we got the room was for the accessible shower in the bathroom. However the barrier placed there rotted up and the shower curtain wasn't wide or long enough, resulting in water going all over the floor, flooding the room. We called and complained and they sent people to give us more towels, they didn't take the used ones, they fixed the light and informed us that they will place us in another room but we have to call tomorrow between 11am and 2pm. 11:14am 11/9/2024 we call and are informed they don't do room changes over the phone and did not have that notation so we needed to come back to the service desk to see the availability. My disabled mother was heading that way so she went all the way to the front and was then informed that she would need her ID to do the request which she did not have. We tried again later and got the new room but some water still comes on the floor due to the short curtain. We were offered only a $50 credit which only got us a preztle a small salad, a small dessert and a cappuccino that was charged to the room , so supposedly the credit will be applied when we leave. 
We also expected to use the pool as it's very therapeutic but come to find out that was closed for the season and there isn't an indoor pool nor do we have access to other resort pools or the other hotels within the resort didn't have indoor pools. We later found out that the spa has a jacuzzi but that is $60 a day. Which would have been the better credit. 

There are other issues as well such as the confusing parking lot, no drop off for grubhub/door dash, lack of transparency of fees, services or alternatives within the hotel to which i had to constantly google for instead of staff knowing or offering this information. 

The Fitness center having yoga equipment but no yoga mats or kettle bells or stretch bands. It seems counter intuitive and not therapeutic. 

This hotel overall was not ada compliant, and appears to be abelsit. I would never recommend it but hope they do better in the future. As I tried to film to inform others of my experience and they hindered me and asked me to stop recording eventhough there is no signage saying such. Almost as if they want to suppress my freedom of speech of exposing thier ableism.

I'll tell you about the most recent woman (22F) that I (27M) was seeing. Long post.

We met through a volunteering opportunity. We scheduled a coffee date, which over the course of about 6 weeks turned into 5 dates. We are both religious, but she was far more along with her Christian faith, while I was very much at the beginning of my religious journey. Leader of youth groups, teacher at her church, etc. (1st sign we were probably not a good fit)

Conversations over text and in person seemed to go well, enough to be able to go on 5 dates. We got along pretty well before we started seeing eachother in that context. Her extended family and mutuals knew we were seeing eachother and they were excited, since we all worked in the same volunteer opportunity. I had made a good impression on them by her report. She insited on multiple dates that she wanted to take it slow, which I was chill with (or so I thought?).

On the 3rd date, she told me she was waiting for marraige. I could tell she was nervous about this because of her past, but I couldn't care less, I just liked the girl. However, my response was admittely not the best - ""*I wasn't waiting for marraige but I would try to give this a good effort to continue seeing eachother.*"" We ended up making out and left it at that. (2nd sign we were not a good fit)

On the 5th date, I had decided to put in a bit more effort, since she had reached a few accomplishments in her life and I wanted to celebrate that. I got her flowers, cooked a damn good meal, and we watched Netflix at my place. I didn't make any moves on her because *I genuinely didn't know how to conduct myself around her since she had explicitly stated that she wanted to wait for marraige.* (3rd sign we were not a good fit). We discussed what we were looking for in a relationship, and received an interesting comment: ""*IDK the idea of getting into a relationship is scary.*"" (yikes...)

Not too long after that, I noticed two things: she was becoming more unavailable (admittedly did get a new job), and I was attached. I didn't double text, overstep boundaries, I just kinda prepared myself for this to not work out. However, while I was at work, someone from her church came up to me asking about *my girlfriend...* I've never met this coworker before. Turns out that the girl I was seeing was telling people we were seeing eachother, and I just happened to run into someone who understood we were ""dating."" I didn't know I was in a relationship...

So after some time, we schedule a call to DTR...and then get hit with the ""I just don't have the bandwidth for a relationship."" She later goes on to tell me she ""just wasnt sure if we were a good fit"" and then we never talked again. 

So to the reason why I posted this: **I recognize fundamentally that we were not compatible with one another, and that the best outcome was to stop seeing eachother. I also recognize that I'm not entitled to anything - sex, nor relationship.** However, I've been a bit disappointed about this situation. I got attached to someone who I was technically not in a relationship with. I had high hopes, and those hopes were not reciprocated. How might I learn from this situation to not become attached so soon? What are your tips for people who are anxiously attached?",1,1731365779.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

","It's been a bit more than 2 months since Dday 2. My WH has been great in showing remorse and wanting to make this marriage work. We had a fight 2 or 3 weeks ago because I told him, in the nicest way possible, that I cannot be physically intimate with him right now, as it's a trigger. I said this after he told me he wanted to be intimate. 

Fast forward to today, it's his birthday and he had a colonoscopy this morning. He had been on a liquid diet all day yesterday, so after the procedure, he was starving. I took care of him, got him coffee, and was taking him to a really nice restaurant for his birthday lunch. On the way there, he was telling me how much he loved me and how he is so lucky to have me. He told me he is never going to fuck up against and he does not want to go down this road again of being unfaithful. Because we were talking about this topic, I told him I loved him too, but I still get triggers. After I said this, he blew up. He got so angry at me and now he's blaming me for ruining his birthday and having no sympathy for him because he had just gone through a surgical procedure. I parked in front of the restaurant but he told me he is now triggered and does not want to eat with me. The next hour or so consisted of him being mad, slamming my car door, throwing things in the car, telling me I fucked up and ruined his birthday repeatedly, telling me he wants to divorce me, and that I am not trying in this marriage and I don't want to be married to him. He said that I didn't have to bring up negative things and why did I have to say I still have triggers. 

He told his parents and his parents are taking his side as well. It's such a shit show now. I am genuinely so confused and I feel like my reconciliation is not going anywhere. I was so triggered Saturday night while going to his uncle's house, but I stayed quiet and dealt with it on my own. We were absolutely fine today, but by me saying that I still have triggers, I don't know why he reacted the way he did. If I didn't want to make this marriage work, I would have walked away the minute I found out he was cheating again. I just don't understand it. I'm hurting so much right now.

I’ve been in this sub and had some varying issues for just over a year. My issues came out of nowhere,  but I was heavily stressed and I have dealt with anxiety and depression since I was 13. I do not have major history of UTIs. One day I woke up and had recurring urgency that just doesn’t go away. I thought it was a UTI but I only ever have WBC found in my urine but nothing cultured. I do not have pain most of the time— sometimes some light burning every so often but not super commonly.

I could probably eliminate all of it 100% but for my own mental health I limit most of these things and deal with mild irritation unless I’m in a bad flare. The thing I have noticed is my sensitivity and urgency is in my urethra and clitoral area. It feels very sensitive and almost slightly stimulated in that area of that makes sense? I’m in pelvic floor therapy now 3 months pp and find relaxation has been slightly helpful but I can’t figure out the connection. I don’t have much pain or history of urinary issues, and I find sitting and laying down actually help versus hinder— same with exercise. It feels like I have pee in urethral area that hasn’t been released and when bad, it’s constant. I’ve done a lot of bladder training so I try and always go no less than 2 hours but when things are decent I can go longer. Anyone have similar issues? It feels like a constant roller coaster.

She then said she was not doing good mentally and physically from her PhD work. Not really something I have known her to talk about before. She never really admitted something like that to me, so I was suprised. 

But I said essentially that it would be ok, she's tough and I knew she can do it, and to reach out if she needed to chat about that (she saw me go through my own mental health issues, which led to our breakup). She hearted my messages, and then said she appreciated my kindness and was glad I was happy, so I ended the chat by hearting hers.

My husband and I have both lived in fully furnished rented flats since we moved in together and aside from a couple of coffee tables and some decorative furnishings, we don’t own any actual furniture like beds, tables, chairs, sofa etc. Our plan (though who really knows as we’re so early on in the game) is to hopefully find somewhere before our tenancy is up so that we can furnish the house with a few very basic things (our bed, kids bed, sofa and table) and then slowly add things from there, but I’m doing the mental maths and a little worried about how this particular aspect might add up once we have spent pretty much all of our savings on the deposit.

Has anyone furnished their house from scratch? I won’t ask how much it might be for us because that’s like asking how long is a piece of string, it all depends on the size of the house and your choice in furniture I guess, but I’d be curious to hear estimates for how much it cost to furnish your house if you were in a similar situation to me! We are looking at three bedroom terraced houses, we live in an expensive area so the house itself will likely be on the smaller side. 

Would love to hear your experiences with this thank you!",0,1731365328.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,5,0.33,False

Both are stimulants, keep you focussed, increase heart rate, natural etc. To me the only difference is caffeine is more societally accepted. 

You say nicotine and immediately people default to cigs and cancer in their minds and have a generally negative things to say when to me it seems to be the same.

Is nicotine really that bad if taken in pure, tobaccoless form?

Are there any studies?",0,1731365307.0,Biohackers,4,0.33,False
