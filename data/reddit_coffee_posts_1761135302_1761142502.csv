Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1761142253.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

He goes to a very small school. We have lived in an extremely rural area for 7 years now, recently moving further North of the Island. We are in Scotland. 
I don’t know I suppose this is a vent but as a shortish summary - moved here from a “rough” area (not rough by any stretch of the imagination compared to England). Got small, old rented house here, have shitty second hand car from the 1990’s, keep chickens, ferrets and 2 dogs. I don’t work and my partner has a hands in job on a boat during the day. 
I do most of pick ups and drop offs. Since I’ve got here I’ve just been continually subjected to other Mum’s ignoring me, blanking me, blatantly leaving me out, I think because I am not a sycophant or an extrovert either, this has played into it. I’m a straightforward person, but well educated, funny, (and poor compared to them). They all have several cars, usually a huge Jeep or two and then a Lexus or a large expensive family car.
Recently I turned up to a school coffee morning the headmistress really encouraged me to go to. I got there and pretty much the whole village was there, crowded around small tables in the cafeteria - maybe 9 to a table on a few tables. There was zero room and nobody made eye contact with me, even when I said hello as other Mums were coming into the room. I had a coffee, nobody spoke to me despite me smiling and saying hi, and I ended up awkwardly sitting on a table by myself because there was no room.  To make it more embarrassing, other people from other tables started just taking chairs from my table and putting them at other tables to squeeze in. I just had my coffee and left. That night my partner took our son to the hall for a school fundraiser and all the Mums left as soon as he got there. Leaving just one girl my son played with for a bit. 
It’s so toxic and cliquey, I don’t have much choice with who to interact with, and these women organised everything between themselves on a WhatsApp group I was added to and just acted like I didn’t exist. They also go every year or twice a year to a Croatian Mum’s hometown on the Dalmatian Coast. My family is also from Croatia (and Austria/Hungary) but I haven’t had a chance to chat with her. Her husband is a teacher in the “rough” place I came from. I bought her daughter a birthday present and I never got a thanks from her. Just blank. 
I’m the only one of the Mums not on the parent teacher council and was never invited. 
I had a job at the shop here and I got fired by the new “development council” after I yelled at a guy that followed me into the warehouse through shop and tried to assault me. 2 days later one of the other Mums takes my job and the exact same shifts.

My eldest was always easy to keep entertained and happy to go anywhere but my youngest is completely different. He always wants to do things with other kids and none of my friends have children his age so weekends and school holidays are usually just the two of us.

He’s not into museums or old houses (they freak him out for some reason) and the only places he’s really loved so far have been the Railway Museum, The Deep (aquarium), Eureka and the cinema.

It’s half term next week. I’m working until 2:45 on Monday and Tuesday, he’s at his dad’s during the day on Wednesday then back with me Thursday to Sunday. I’ve got some free cinema tickets I can use for one day but I’m really struggling for ideas for the rest of the week that don’t cost a fortune.

We’ve been to every local park more times than I can count and he gets bored quickly if it’s just me and him. We’ve done all the nearby museums (he’s outgrown them now) and we’ve been to the aquarium three times recently. It’s one of those places that loses its magic after the first visit.

It was so much easier when my daughter was his age because my niece was the same age so I could go to my sister’s, have a coffee and a chat and the girls would happily play together all day. She was also happy to do home-based stuff with me like pretend play, Lego, movie afternoons and baking whereas my son just isn’t into that kind of thing.

I’m stuck for ideas on how to keep him entertained next week without spending loads.

She said on her tinder profile she was single and on her swingers profile that she was in an open relationship. She claimed when I asked that her partner lived alone and they were both happily open to meet and date other people. I accepted this and decided that it could be possible; after chatting for a couple of weeks she seemed normal and we went out for a coffee and usual date stuff and then went back to her house where things got very weird and disturbing. At her house she asked me to wait in the living room as she had to get changed (I assumed that normally means something more comfortable) but when I went into her living room I saw that she had pictures of her partner and their wedding and the 3 kids they had! None of this was ever brought up when we talked. This should’ve been a sign ahead of time she wasn’t quite right but I sat in the room and was going to ask her in detail when see came back. When she did finally come back she was in a dressing gown and told me to follow her upstairs, and I asked could we talk first and she said we could talk later just come upstairs with her. I followed her upstairs into a bedroom but not her bedroom! She then took off the dressing gown revealing an adult diaper and said “come play with me daddy” it clicked that she had a child kink that again she had kept hidden but also she wanted to do it in her children’s bedroom! At this point I said I wasn’t interested anymore and left, and got a bombardment of messages from her saying I was disgusting and a waste of space. 
I decided to take screenshots of her profile and messages and inform her partner (the one knowingly and happily in an open relationship) what had been going on and the fact it could’ve happened with different people.
He said they weren’t open and I must’ve been making it up because his wife wouldn’t do that and wouldn’t do that in theirs kids bedroom!

1od972d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1od972d/5_kitchen_design_tips_from_a_cabinet_maker_things/,5 kitchen design tips from a cabinet maker (things I wish every homeowner knew),"**1. Prioritize drawers over doors.**  
Drawers are hands-down the most efficient way to use storage space. You can see and reach everything without getting on your knees to dig through the back of a cabinet — plus, you utilize all that vertical space that would otherwise go to waste. Deep drawers for pots and pans, shallow ones for utensils, and bonus points for specialized drawers with built-in dividers for Ziplocs or cutlery. Once you’ve lived with them, you’ll never go back.



**2. Rethink corner storage.**  
Traditional Lazy Susans waste space and almost always start spinning unevenly after a few years. Consider blind-corner pullouts instead — they’re smooth, accessible, and make every inch usable. The setup looks cleaner and functions way better.



**3. Run some upper cabinets down to the countertop.**  
Adding countertop-height uppers (sometimes called “counter cabinets” or “appliance garages”) turns awkward counter space into functional storage for toasters, blenders, and coffee makers. It’s one of the most underrated design upgrades — helps hide visual clutter and keeps the counters feeling open and intentional.



**4. Run cabinets all the way to the ceiling.**  
Full-height cabinets not only give you extra storage, they *visually stretch* the room. Ceilings look taller, the kitchen feels more custom, and you eliminate that awkward dust-collecting gap at the top. Even if the uppermost shelves are for holiday dishes or serving platters, it’s worth every inch.



**5. Choose inset or full overlay doors.**  
Half-overlay doors are a dead giveaway of builder-grade cabinetry. They show uneven gaps, collect grime, and look dated fast. Inset or full-overlay construction creates a seamless, high-end appearance — the kind you see in designer kitchens.



If anyone’s in middle Tennessee and planning a kitchen remodel, I run **Parallel Millworks**, where we design and build custom kitchens, built-ins, and vanities — all crafted start to finish in *6 weeks or less (or $1,000 back)*.

1od96sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1od96sc/what_began_as_my_way_of_surviving_chronic_illness/,What began as my way of surviving chronic illness accidentally turned into something much bigger.,"A few months ago, my days started revolving around medications, notes, and appointments.

I was diagnosed with asthma, and out of nowhere, health tracking became a full-time job I never signed up for. I kept forgetting what to mention in doctor visits, lost track of what meds were working, and couldn’t even keep my bills straight.

Meanwhile, the advice I kept getting?  
*""Drink more water.""*  
*""Stay positive.""*

And every time I heard that, a small part of me just wanted to scream — not because they were wrong, but because when you’re doing *everything right* and still wake up exhausted, positivity feels like a band-aid on a deeper problem.

What I needed wasn’t more motivation or another health app.  
I needed clarity.  
A place to actually see my health, not just react to it.

So, I opened Notion and started building something for myself — a system where I could map out symptoms, treatments, costs, triggers, and moods all in one connected space.  
I didn’t even think of it as a “product.” It was just survival.

But a funny thing happened: that small system started making a big difference.  
My doctor visits stopped feeling like interrogations.  
I actually *saw* what was helping and what wasn’t.  
And for the first time in months, I felt like I had some control again.

Eventually, friends who also lived with chronic illnesses tried it. One said it was the first time they didn’t dread managing their condition. That one message meant everything to me.

That’s when HealthOS became more than a personal tool — it became something worth sharing.

Not as a polished “startup,” but as the result of someone overwhelmed trying to make sense of life again.

I’m still learning and refining it, but this process taught me something I didn’t expect:  
that organization, in a way, *is* self-care.

If your health has ever felt like chaos you can’t get ahead of — I get it.  
I’ve been there, and I’m still figuring it out one dashboard, one day at a time.

How do you stay organized when life (or health) feels like too much?  
Would love to hear how others manage it — digital or not.

I’m planning to bake a tiramisu cake (not the traditional ladyfinger version) for my bf's birthday. He's Italian, so I really want to make it as authentic as possible.

I used to bake a lot, but haven’t had much time lately since I’m studying. I recently got a mixer (finally) after doing everything by hand before, but I haven’t had the chance to use it yet, so this will be my first go with it.

Here are the things I’d love some advice on:

* Do I need to include rum or whiskey? My bf is allergic to alcohol, and it’s been hard to find a good recipe without it.
* What kind of cake would work best ( eg vanilla, sponge, or something else)
* What kind of coffee should I use for the espresso soak? I only have Nescafé Gold, but I know espresso usually needs ground coffee. Any brand or blend recommendations? (I’ll list what’s available at my local grocer.)
* Which brand would you recommend? I’ll include a few links to the ones I can get locally.
* I want to write “Happy Birthday” on top using a stencil and cocoa powder. Would that work, or is there a better/easier method?

1od908m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1od908m/i_dont_see_a_point_why_i_should_get_an_official/,I don't see a point why I should get an official diagnosis just to prove it to other people,"I'm undiagnosed, but I'm 100% sure that I have ADHD, 100% sure that I have dyscalculia and 95% sure that I'm at least somewhere on the Autitic spectrum. And 100% frustrated why people think I'm faking it or making it up just bc I don't have an official diagnosis.

When I was a kid, the ADHD/Autism diagnosis ""hype"" started with kids my age and I didn't believe it was a thing. I kept thinking ""it's just being a kid"", everyone's a little different. But I also thought ""If anyone has ADHD, it's me for sure."" because I couldn't sit still and I couldn't concentrate like people expected me to. Except if it was something I loved, then I could do it four hours nonstop. That's also the main reason why I didn't really think more about it.

Then in school I saw kids with dyslexia who were excused for certain tests and weren't forced to write words properly and I kept thinking ""Sure I believe they have problems with letters, but everyone's bad at something. Some people are bad at sports, some people are bad at maths, we're just called stupid."" My parents always said how I needed to learn the clock 3 times before it finally stuck and they still love to tease me when it takes me a little longer than normal to read an analog clock. (I started using digital clocks the moment I had a chance) I've always switched numbers and I've also always confused the 4 and the 7. I've told many people since first grade, but nobody believed me. The question was always ""Why?"" I don't f\*cking know why, they look similar that's the only answer I can give you! (In Germany, we write the 7 with a line, so they really kinda do look similar)

So all my life I've had these ""quirks"" and I was told that it wasn't a thing, I was just weird. 

In school I was average, I wasn't called stupid, but extremely lazy and some teachers really disliked me because I really didn't pay attention. For years I mostly stared out the window and made up stories bc I was so bored. Looking back, it's actually amazing that I wasn't even THAT bad in school. But school was hell for me. I had a few friends, but was generally an outsider and every single Sunday made me horrified for Monday that I couldn't think of anything else. I had nightmares regularly that only stopped when I finished school.

That's when I finally started to accept myself, learn to live with my ""quirks"", learn to adapt and learn to use them for my advantage.

Years later, Tiktok came and suddenly ""everyone has ADHD nowadays"". I saw myself in those videos, but usually thought nothing of it. I remember thinking ""If that's a disorder, then I really don't want to meet ""normal"" people bc they seem boring af""

Then finally, last summer, I met with friends and we talked about ""needing coffeine to wake up"" and I explained that I (actually me and my dad) had this weird thing where we drank coffee and we fall asleep and then one of my friends said ""that's actually a sign for ADHD"" and it really opened my eyes. I started looking into ADHD (and later AuDHD) and it explained SO MUCH! I even did tests where I pretty much checked every box, saw people explain how they told their doctor a few of my symptoms and it was a dead giveaway for ADHD. So now I'm 2 things: happy because I finally have an explanation for everything and that I'm not weirder than the next person, but also disappointed bc I finally accepted myself the way I am and now people tell me it's a disorder.

I still don't see it that way. I strongly believe that ADHD and Autism can be useful for many things, but that in this modern society it's no longer needed as much and is viewed as a negative thing. 

I don't want medication, I haven't struggled in silence for almost 30 years (and successfully so!) for me to now change my life completely and try to be ""normal"" again. 

But almost everytime I tell people that I have ADHD (my parents are surprisingly understanding now since I told them about the coffee thing), they ask ""Oh do you have a diagnosis?"" No I don't. But I researched a long time for me to know that I have WAYYY too many ADHD symptoms for it just to be ""oh just weird me that's really close to ADHD"" But as soon as people hear that I'm in fact not diagnosed, it's not a thing anymore. ""Yeah but everyone does that!"" or ""I really don't think you have ADHD"" What, you know me better than I know myself?

FFS!

If I cut off my foot and told you, ""I just cut off a foot"", you wouldn't say ""Maybe let's ask a doctor for a proper diagnosis"", would you? Not to mention that even many doctors don't agree with ADHD or Autism. 

So then I go to other ADHD spaces and I see ""self-diagnosis is bullshit"" 

What, so I have to go make an appointment (yikes) with a doctor (yikes) and go to that appointment while I have plenty of better things to do, just for that doctor to tell me what I already know? For what? So that other people believe me? This is ridiculous!

But the more people I see that say self-diagnosing ADHD is wrong, I wonder if they think I'm faking it or if doctors will test your blood or brain to see if a special ADHD code is written in one's DNA or something bc correct me if I'm wrong but afaik doctors only observe what you tell them and what you make them see and then they give you the ADHD diagnosis.

1od8yi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/QantasAirways/comments/1od8yi2/business_class_experience/,Business class experience,"TL;DR - terrible service and experience on Qantas business class for my first experience. 

I'll start this off by saying I've never flown business class in my life, but for our honeymoon, my partner and I decided to return from europe in business class (using points). We were super excited about this. 

Our first leg was from London to Delhi on British Airways on a nice new A350. It was an exceptional experience. Extremely attentive crew, food and drink selection was great, comfortable seats and bedding. It was everything I thought business class would be. Its the first time I've ever slept on a plane which was amazing for a overnight flight. 

The second leg was Qantas from Bangaluru to Sydney on a A330-200. I won't harp on about the aircraft age and comfort as we all know these aircraft are long in the tooth now and I can be accepting of that to a degree, you don't always get to be on a flash new plane. 

What shocked me was the abysmal service. From boarding to unboading, the cabin crew felt extremely uninterested, inexperienced and rude at times. Here's a few of the 'highlights':

- Recieved a 1/4 glass full of champagne arrival drink because ""we don't want to open another bottle yet"".

- Dinner was terrible, and I'm not a fussy eater. Entree dumplings that were hard and chewy, ""salad"" (wilted lettuce) that was drowned in vinegar. Butter harder than a rock that you couldn't spread. The chicken dinner was served essentially cold (the plate felt like it had come out of a freezer??). It tasted marginally better but by no means business class level. The pannacotta dessert tasted like packet coconut jelly and weird. What on earth are they serving...

- Sleep time.. the lady next to me watching a movie had her reading light on for 2 hours for who knows what reason (she wasn't reading anything). Cabin crew could have definitely asked her if it needed to be on but ignored it. I couldn't sleep so I raised my window shade to look at the stars. A flight attendant told me I had to shut the window shade after 10minutes of me enjoying the stars.. It was pitch black outside. 

- I got up to pee in the middle of the night and two cabin crew were sitting in their seats showing each other something on their phones. One of them was blocking the path to the toilet up the front. I honestly stood in front of them for at least 30 seconds while they talked to each other until one of them got up and looked at me like I had just inconvenienced him greatly. Didn't even say a word. Then when I was done in the toilet, I waited another 30seconds for him to let me past again! What a great feeling that is by a already annoyed passenger. 

- Breakfast... I got served another passengers breakfast. Stale toast with rock hard butter again and honey with a luke warm coffee (again the cup felt like it had come from a freezer). I honestly thought it was the entree for breakfast so I ate it, the crew didn't realise till 40minutes later that I ate the wrong breakfast, she said sorry alot and cleared it away... didn't say another word about it. Wtf? 

There was plenty more minor things which I won't write about but what a terrible experience. I'd almost rather have saved the points and been in economy it was that dissatisfying. I would be ropeable if I paid the $3000+ price tag. Pick up your game Qantas.",1,1761141327.0,QantasAirways,3,1.0,False

Here’s how it went with my dream.


In a dream, at home, I sound like a child version? My parent mentions where are going somewhere and promise we will go there, but every time we are about to, it gets delayed with something, it kept repeating, then when I woke up, then back to sleep, then after 4th time falling back to sleep it kept repeating, I would be having a temper tantrum, trying to break something, maybe growl?, yelling in a higher pitched like the sound of that child voice. 

that’s when it was angering me to punch something, but I decided to get up at 4am, get coffee and all. It’s so weird to considering I’m a 27 year old, nothing much going on in my life.

So, this theme, the previous ones, where dreams of a child version of myself, learning we are in a different country, I ask my parents when are we going home? Why we gotta wait an extra week. That week turns to another, then a month. So the same tantrums and panic happens, trying to figure out ways to get back, rob credit cards, my mind suggested me, we attack people in the dream?

This kind of dreams been repeating, I guess since I was a teen, so I really don’t know why this keeps happening, when I wake up, I wake up confused on what is happening, like once I wake up crying, then suddenly I’m like, what the fuck? What is happening.

1od8xlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1od8xlp/is_this_a_boundary_or_a_veto_need_outside/,Is this a boundary or a veto? Need outside perspective.,"My husband and I have been navigating polyamory for about a year, and had been open for a while prior to that. Part of it has been great and part has been really painful. Earlier this year he got involved with someone and they broke a lot of trust — there was secrecy, broken agreements, and it seriously impacted my mental health. Things between them fizzled out the past several months (they haven’t seen each other romantically since May, she canceled four times on him in July and they haven’t even talked regularly the past month). So, I presumed things were naturally ending. 

I shared with him a month or so ago that I couldn’t be in this marriage if he kept seeing her, and he basically said “then we should divorce.” Obviously, it was an emotionally heightened moment and unfortunately, we never revisited that conversation (life with three kids and work and our own therapy appointments, plus marriage therapy, etc). 

Recently, I found out he reached out to her again, wanting to get coffee and intentionally reconnect. For me, this feels like reopening something that already caused a lot of harm. In my own therapy and self-work, I’ve developed what I think is a new boundary for polyamory: I won’t stay in a situation where my partner keeps re-engaging with someone who’s been part of breaking agreements and destabilizing my mental health.

I’m hesitant to bring this to my husband as a boundary and want to check myself. I don’t see it as control; it feels like a boundary around my emotional safety. But part of me worries it sounds like a veto, even though I’m stating what I will do (leave the relationship) and not stating what he can or cannot do (I’m certainly not forbidding him from seeing her). 

We’ve done so much work in marriage therapy together, and our marriage is evolving and growing into a much more inter-dependent, less enmeshed and less codependent relationship, with healthy autonomy, better communication and awareness of our triggers/cycles, and even more respect for our differences (he is polyamorous and I am not; I’m happy in an open dynamic but have done a lot of work to support his desire for additional loving relationships). I’m hopeful we can keep doing this work and am afraid this boundary of mine will end all that work.

I think that  retention comes crashing down in the next 3-5 years

This is just a shower thought so I have not fully vetted my own analysis on this....

Also, while this touches politics, I don't really view this as a political issue, but a cultural issue. Unfortunately, in 2025, everything seems irreversibly intertwined with politics.

For the last 10 years we have seen the rise of Trump/MAGA, Alpha-Male podcasts/comedians, and Christian Nationalism.

Gen Z males have eaten it up in large numbers, this is a major reason why Trump won in 2024.

Within this community, there is a huge emphasis on Christianity, the idea the US should be/is a Christian Nation, and the general notion that secularism it at the root of our country's daily woes.

My anecdotal observation is that this has kept a lot of Gen Z active in the church.

A lot of this church adherence has been without the major cognitive dissonance that many of us older folks experienced because the Church has been neutered and they are basically wishy washy on everything....EVERYTHING.

As the manosphere slowly move on from Trump and Christian Nationalism undertones, followed by the inevitable collapse of the MAGA movement, Gen Z will finally start looking at their life with some critical thinking and realize they are wasting their time and money.

The Church will make a few last ditch efforts to keep their grip....

They will allow coffee.

Garments will become 100% optional outside the temple

Women will either get the Priesthood or be allowed to hold significant positions of authority (or both)

They might even let the gays get baptized and married in the temple.

But, at some point in the next 3-5 years, I think we will see a wave of all of these dude bros and trad wives quitting.",8,1761141194.0,MormonShrivel,3,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Swansea vs. QPR: A Clash of Fortresses and Fortunes**  
The Championship’s midweek spectacle pits Swansea City against Queens Park Rangers in a battle of wits, wills, and slightly confused bookmakers. Let’s dissect this clash with the precision of a linesman and the humor of a pub quiz host.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieges

The numbers suggest Swansea (-250) are the slight favorites, with implied probabilities hovering around **50%** (decimal odds of 2.14 average). QPR (+330) check in at roughly **30%**, while the draw sits at **30%**. The total goals market favors **Under 2.5 goals** (implied \~57%), hinting at a tactical tussle rather than a fireworks show.

Swansea’s home form is their secret weapon. They’ve earned 13 points from 10 games at the Swansea.com Stadium this season, a record that’s “respectable” by Swansea standards (read: barely avoiding relegation). QPR, meanwhile, have lost just once in their last six league games but stumbled 1-5 to Millwall in pre-season—a defeat so惨 that their goalkeeper still dreams about it in black and white.

---

### Digesting the News: Confidence, Crises, and Coffee

Swansea manager Alan Sheehan is bullish, claiming his team can “go up a level.” Translation: They’ll stop looking like a spreadsheet error and start playing like a team with aspirations. Recent form? A six-game winless streak, including a limp draw at Southampton. Sheehan’s optimism is the sports equivalent of ordering a double espresso at 2 PM—energetic but slightly desperate.

QPR, under Julien Stephan, have been a rollerco

The chutney packs a punch and we couldn't express clearly how good the momos were with tears _of joy_ streaming down our face and runny nose while trying to pay for them. All in all, excellent momos - perfect pricing.

1od8l8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1od8l8y/update_my_sister_accuses_me_of_physically/,Update: My sister accuses me of physically endangering my child.,"Hi there, Reddit. I didn't think I would honestly have an update, especially not as big as this one, but here we are.

To recap for people who have no idea what I'm talking about, this happened during a sleepover at my older sister's house. She's a mother to two kids, one five and one nine-year-old. I'm a mother to an 18 month old, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

I was trying to get through a particularly rough butt change with my toddler son, and he was fighting me all the way through it. Running away, getting up, kicking me, rolling around, crying and yelling. The usual. So, as he gets up, I'm holding his hand to keep him from running away, and he realizes that I'm holding his hand, so the naturally, the thing he does next is throw himself backwards so hard that his head connects with my temple / eyebrow area. 

In pain and frustrated, pick him up around his waist, I lay him on the ground, holding him down with his arms pinned to his sides by getting his legs up in the air so I can get his diaper off of him, and just as I get his diaper off, my older sister who wasn't even in the room, (we'll call her Hailey) comes flying through the doorway yelling at the top of her lungs at me in front of her children, screaming and pointing her finger standing over top of us. She accused me of throwing him into the ground.

Her kids ran out of the room crying, they went and they hid in their CLOSET. She left immediately after screaming at me and my son, which I don't believe is something that someone would do if they genuinely witnessed you actively physically abusing your child.. at least I wouldn't leave the child that I thought I witnessed being abused, alone with said abuser, but that's what my sister did.

I got picked up, I went home, ask reddit for some advice. Some kind of strangers told me it was best to distance myself from her, which is exactly what I did. Her and my kids got together a couple of times after that, but she was incredibly rude, snarky, condescending, while not acknowledging anything that she did or said previously, or asking me for any details or my own side of the story. 
____________________________________________________

So, THIS is where the update comes in. I was with my father, with my son, around noon one day visiting the cemetery and our relatives, when our truck broke down. We were stuck at the cemetery for almost an hour and a half in the sun waiting for the tow truck to come get us, which sounds bad, it wasn't all that bad. The kind receptionist in the office let us sit in and relax in the air conditioning, there was a gas station just across the street from the cemetery, so we grab snacks and drinks for the weight. It wasn't all that bad. The tow truck comes, we got a ride home to my dad's house. I do not live with my dad, and while I would usually spend the night, this was unforeseen and I didn't have enough diapers to spend the night, and due to the truck being broke down, we couldn't just go get any diapers, so at that point I was asking my mom if she could come pick my self and my son up. 

Her response is that she doesn't want to drive that far, ask me if I can doordash diapers but I just didn't have the money for that plus a good tip, so I just said well, we'll figure it out. Once we realized we could call one of my dad's friends, and ask him for a ride to the store or to my house, I get a call from my sister. She says that our mother got a hold of her because she was worried about me and where I was stuck at, that she heard that the truck was broke down, all of those things, and that she would like to come pick me and my son up. 

This is where I'll note that my sister was incredibly rude and condescending in her text messages to begin with. I asked her if she was sure that this was something that she was wanting to do, because I wasn't sure what her situation was for the night, what she was doing with her kids, if it was an inconvenience. She got snarky with me and told me that if I needed a ride, then to figure it out or she was going to tell me no. So of course, after she told me she was halfway there, I said sure, just come pick us up. My Dad decided to still call his friend so he could get a ride to AutoZone for parts, so they could go out to dinner, a couple of things. My sister said that she was still happy to come get me. 

My sister arrives just a couple minutes after my Dad's friend does, so my Dad's friend is parked completely inside of the driveway, while my sister is parked blocking the exit / entrance to the driveway. She did not attempt to pull her car to the side or move or park in the parking spot as to not block the entrance. She gets out of the car, she doesn't have her kids with her, she says that she absolutely has to use the bathroom. 

That's no issue in itself, but my grandparents go to sleep at 5:30 in the afternoon. I told her all she had to do was stay quiet and not wake them up. What does she do? She goes inside and starts excitedly yelling about how there are two bathrooms connected. (Yes, I know the setup of the house is odd. My great grandfather built the house himself for his wife and family. We love it very much.)

My sister was speaking so loudly, that my grandparents who had been asleep for 2 hours at this point, get up in their underwear and nightgown to see what all the commotion is. I apologize to them profusely, my sister used the restroom, and we went back outside. 

I would also like to note here, that this was when my dad came up to me, after getting my son in the car and buckled for me, that he absolutely did not want to put my son in her car. That my sister's car was so disgusting, that he absolutely did not want to put my kid in there. That it was as bad as a hoarder house, but inside of a car. Not to mention, she smokes weed and cigarettes in the car freely with her children as passengers, so the car smelled like stale cigarette smoke and ash. 

My dad and his friend get loaded up into their car, which is at the front of the driveway in front of the house. My sister is still parked in front of the exit to the driveway. Thinking it's time to leave, I get into the car and get buckled. She stands outside of the car for another 10 minutes, lighting a cigarette and smoking just half of it. I sat there the entire time knowing that my family was trying to leave and get to AutoZone, 15 minutes away, which now closed in less than 35 minutes.

I poked my head out the window to my sister and let her know that we needed to get going right about now, or at least move the car to the side so that my dad and his friend could leave. I quite literally remember saying ""we need to skedaddle."" Because I was trying to keep things civil. She said, ""I'm going to smoke the last of this cigarette before I have to go get my kids tomorrow, because this is the of the free time that I get to myself, and I don't care if I'm being selfish. I'm doing things for me now.""

I thought genuinely that she didn't realize my dad and his friend were trying to leave. I reiterated to her, that AutoZone closes in 35 minutes and that they need to go now if they're going to make it to pick up a part. That she didn't need to put her cigarette out, just that we needed to pull off to the side at least, just enough so that they could get through and leave.

This was when she started going OFF. I sat there while she bullied me, genuinely contemplating just getting my son out of the car and making her leave. The only reason I didn't was because he was already buckled in, and it seemed like a waste of everyone's time to do so.

She immediately started ranting and yelling, clapping her hands on my face about, quote-unquote, how, she doesn't care if it sounds selfish, but that she's not moving her car for anybody, including my father. That my father and his friend can go frick themselves (all cuss words included), and that she herself has two cars that need to be fixed, and that she doesn't give a frick if someone else has expenses and repairs on their own car. That my father is a fricking grown man who can figure out his own problems on his own, that this is the only free time she has until she has her kids back again tomorrow and she's not doing any favors for anybody. That I don't understand what it's like to truly work and need a break like she does.

I told her straight up that it was genuinely rude to say those things about my family. She got in the car and continued talking about how since I don't care what she says, why does it matter? I never listen to anybody, I don't care what she has to think. 

She did this for two blocks. We pulled up to a stop sign, she's continuing to yell at me. I calmly told her, that her feelings were valid and okay, but that she's not allowed to yell at me, that that's not okay, and that she needs to focus on the road ahead of her. That my son is in the back of the car, she's obviously distressing him, she's making him cry. That she needed to stop.

She started SCREAMING and yelling, she turned completely sideways in her seat facing me, clapping her hands in my face, while DRIVING A CAR. She was paying zero attention to her vehicle or the road. 

I'll be honest, I did lose my cool a couple of times at things she was saying. There were moments that I wish I had stayed completely silent, and not given her a reaction to feed off of. 

She was completely bullying me. There was no actual situation or point that she was making, there was no coherent idea that she had for the conversation, it was her screaming and driving a car recklessly with a 1 year old in the back. 

She brought up all different types of things she thought about me, how she thought I was going to get CPS called on me and I was going to lose my child? How she would be happy to take him when something obviously goes wrong, because she said she knew it would? How she knew that I was going to get sent to jail for either being a drug addict or end up killing myself? How I'm just a little girl with a middle school education, and that I'm so much dumber than her, how I'm not half the mom that she is and I never will be.

I've never done hard drugs in my life, I've smoked weed and hit a couple vapes in my teenage years. The only times I've ever left my son alone with a babysitter, was with our own mother who was happy to watch him and lay him down for bed, so that I could go see a movie with a woman who was having a birthday party, WHO WAS FRIENDS WITH MY MOTHER?? Like, I don't know where she gets these ideas that I'm out doing whatever I want?? I can't even sleep until 7:30 am! My best friends are my mom and my dad. I don't know what she has in her head. 😂😭

She continued to go off about how I'm a horrible parent for smoking weed sometimes after my son goes down to bed, meanwhile she's drinking vodka inside of water bottles while driving her kids around. I used to worry heavily when I was in her car if she was sober or not. She's smoking and hot boxing her kitchen and her bedroom in her small, two bedroom apartment while her children are walking in and out asking us questions. She smokes both marijuana and cigarettes regularly string summer inside the house, yet she has a BALCONY. 

She even screamed at me while pulling into my complex and told me that it was impossible for my son to have thrown himself onto the ground at her house, because it's scientifically proven that toddlers ONLY throw themselves backwards, not forwards. (While I was telling this story to a family friend, we actively watched my son throw himself forward during a tantrum. LITERALLY doing the thing she told me wa ""scientifically impossible for babies to do, and you'd know that if you were an educated and good mother, like I AM.""

So, she drove down the highway at 80MPH and yelled at me the entire way home, the entire way. She was so distracted while driving, I had to tell her to watch the road twice. Once because she was swerving into the median, a grassy ditch at 75MPH. The other time was because she was accelerating so fast, she almost hit the back of a semi truck while looking straight at me, yelling! She couldn't even slow down properly, because there was someone riding the back bumper of her car, she had to switch lanes just to make sure she didn't hit the semi. 

She then told me after I advised her to stop yelling and to watch the road, that she was the adult and I was the child, and that I wasn't about to give her driving lessons, ""Miss I've only had my license for 8 hours"" was exactly what she said to me. I had passed my permit test that day."" She threatened that if I told her to watch the road one more time or for teacher driving, that she would leave me on the side of the highway with no phone, and take my son home and I just ""wouldn't know where they went"", because ""she loves him more than I do.""

She said that I was ""a not shit ass fucking person."" Literally her words. She told me that I was a horrible mom for not moving in with her to basically be her living nanny, because I need to get out of my mom's house. She told me I was never going to be anything, I was never going to get a job, I was never going to find an education. She told me to prove her wrong.

She doesn't come to my house, she doesn't check in with the family. She doesn't see how we're doing, she doesn't contribute to anything. She does nothing. She doesn't live with us either, she's her own family in her own life, so I would never expect her to come over to my house and contribute or to try to convince other people to contribute to something that they're not, but for her to try to talk down to me like she knows what I do in my own house? When she doesn't visit, she doesn't come see my own child, her nephew? Her nephew doesn't even know her by name. 

Not to mention, we all know too well that my sister is one of the most frustrated and short-tempered people I have ever known. She's been this way her whole life. I've watched her get angry at her child for not being able to find the ketchup in the fridge, I've watched her get mad at her autistic child for being too loud when she can't control it. Mothers get overwhelmed and stressed, I get that. For her to treat me like an alien when I'm a first-time mother was zero support going through postpartum? Is insane to me. 

The car that she pick us up in had already been in a wreck, so the passenger side door was totally smashed in. I had to climb through the driver side door just to get into my seat to get home. Not to mention, her seats are absolutely disgusting. They're covered in liquid, spilled coffee, slushy, Crumbs from food, ash, nicotine build up. Just disgusting, and I had to put my hands all over that..

We pulled up to my house, and she leaned over top of me, which I thought she was trying to take my phone out of my hand so I pulled my phone away, but she opened the broken door and forced it open so that I'd have to go out the broken door. So I got out, and I poked my head in and and in the most polite voice possible, I said quote don't worry, I'll make sure your door shuts all the way. I slammed the absolute hell out of that door. 

I got to the backseat, I get my son out of the car. I'm just talking to him, I'm focusing on him, playing with him and asking him if he's okay. The whole time I'm getting my son out of the car she's still yelling and smacking her steering wheel, pointing her fingers at me and trying to get a reaction. I simply focus on getting my son out of the car, making sure we had everything we needed and making sure we didn't forget anything. 

I got my son out he's in my arms, in the car seat, I've got two bags on my other arm, so it's hard for me to shut the door. I shut the door as best as I could to make sure that it closed, and she jumped out of her car and flew into my face, clapping her hands and screaming at me with her shoulders raised up.

Basically, if you've ever seen a video of two middle schoolers trying to fight each other, but they won't put their hands on each other first, so they're just squaring up and scooting themselves into your face to see if you'll hit first, that's literally what she was doing while I had my 18 year old month son in my hands. 

I was absolutely pissed. I just started walking towards the house if she followed me, and she was going to follow me into the house and keep screaming at me too. The only reason she didn't was because my mother came out of the house to see what was wrong, thinking that me shutting the broken passenger side door, was my sister hitting my mom's car with her own.

Absolutely pissed, she had just gotten in my face trying to get me to physically fight her or go to reaction while I have my 18-month-old in my arms. Before I went inside I finally let it bubble over, and I looked her dead in the face and told her that she's a ""ratchet ass bitch"" who drives their kids around drunk while smoking cigarettes in the car with them, and that if I was going to take parenting advice from anybody, it definitely wouldn't be her.

My sister didn't follow me inside us to make a big story about how I was so disrespectful on the ride back, how she should have never given me a ride, how I think I'm better than everyone else. I could hear her from inside my house, screaming and yelling at my mom about the situation.

It's been a couple months since this happened now, and I've just distanced myself from everyone. I haven't shown up to lunches, I'm not coming to birthday parties or holidays. I feel very betrayed by not only my sister, but my family. She put our lives in danger by not paying attention on the highway, not paying attention on the road. Screaming and crying, full tears in her eyes while punching the steering wheel as she's actively going 75 miles an hour down the road.

No one confronted her, no one asked her why she did what she did, no one spoke up for me on my behalf. I've decided that I'm not showing up to christmas, I'm going to spend the night with my dad's side of the family and then come home so we can see my mom, specifically.

I just don't know what to think. Like I stated in the last post, I understand her anxiety and assumption thinking something might have been happening, due to the nature of the childhoods we endured growing up in. She didn't come in and ask me any questions, she didn't see anything with her own eyes, she heard my son crying and automatically assumed that I was hurting him? 

She recently had a friend that she stopped being friends with, not because that friend was actually smacking her children in the face who were only 4 years old and hitting them as discipline, that's of course, not why she stopped being friends with them. She stopped being friends with them because there was some work drama over their boyfriends, and that woman said something that my sister didn't like so she dropped her. I'm wondering if her connection to this person and seeing that this person was abusing her own child, might have given her the idea to accuse me of doing the same thing to mine? I have no idea, cause I don't know where the hell this could have come from.

I don't know why I felt compelled to finish the story lol but yeah, this was the result of all of this👍

Let me know if you have any thoughts or advice. I haven't talked to her family since this, which was in early August. I don't plan on opening that like of communication again, either. 😔 I miss my nieces so much, but my child and I refuse to subject ourselves to this continuous drama and bulls**t just because my older sister is bored and is looking for a fight.

Let me know what you thought, I never thought I'd have a story to post on reddit, let alone an update.

There is a shell here for something wonderful but its simply just that, a shell of what it could have been.
      First let's start with location! The city is crafted well enough with certain places feeling empty, but it looks ""okay"" nothing great but not horrible. Pokemon games are never known for graphics and this is no exception to that, its what is to be expected. The real problem lies is what I personally feared would be the problem, and it is 100% a problem. When a setting is a big city that city needs to breath, it needs to be alive and unfortunately we just do not get that. Streets with a few trash cans linking places that really just dont have alot going on. Doors that never open and so much space just existing for the sake of doing so. Having a city with no real city life is just unacceptable. 10 hours in and you have pretty much experienced what the game has to offer in its full extent. In the past this was okay, but we're hitting a point now that for the cost of the game its just not anymore. What would have been nice is some life in the actual city, maybe something simple like renting and upgrading apartments and decorating them, a mini game center like arcade etc. So many things that could have been added to just bring the city life to full bloom and really make more than what it is inviting npc's for coffee to develop deeper characters just so much i can think of that would have really taken the experience to a new level. I can not recommend this game, and I won't, the finish product has less heart in it than a roblox game made by a child. One of my favorite review quotes lately is ""Life is simply to short to play okay games"" and unfortunately I think this falls into that category. To me its a $40 game with a $70 price tag, and if you enjoy it thats fine, im happy for you. But I also think there is a point where fans need to press back and say "" This should have had more"". I know wanting essentially a city life sim inside a pokemon game would be alot to ask, but really just sit and think about how nice that would have been. Inviting friends to see your apartment and how you decorated, going to a mini game center to play random mini games with friends and really just big emphasis on that. Collecting tickets for decorations for your apartment in the mini games with friends just a wholesome and enjoyable young adult in the city feel. Unfortunately if this is ever added it will be a $30 dlc ",0,1761140398.0,pokemon,5,0.23,False
1od8k8j,https://i.redd.it/7kq1u6cw1owf1.jpeg,My daily 16:8 IF routine,"Hi friends! I wanted to share my intermittent fasting journey in case it’s helpful to anyone who’s just starting out or finding it hard to stay consistent.

It took me some time to find my rhythm, but now 16:8 feels pretty natural. My window is usually 10 am to about 5:30 pm (usually 4:30 pm). The biggest shift was learning not to be too rigid, and building small habits to get through the tougher hours.

* **Mornings:** I wake up at 5 am and start with tea and lemon, then coffee around 6 - no food yet. 6-8 am used to be rough, but now I stay busy with work, kids, and coffee, and it passes quickly.
* **Exercise:** Around 8-9 am I work out and use the steam room. I usually don’t feel hungry right after.
* **First meal (10 am):** Usually a salad with some protein.
* **Afternoon dip (2 pm):** This happens most days. I’ll have some fruit or a small treat with coffee, which helps.
* **Dinner (5-5:30 pm):** I eat dinner early, and it makes my sleep much better.
* **Evenings:** They used to be tough, but now I just drink tea or water.

What made it work for me: 1. Being flexible on weekends - no guilt, 2. Sitting with my family during meals, even if I’m not eating, 3. Remembering it does get easier with time.

If you’re still figuring it out, don’t worry. With a little time, it really does start to feel natural.",1,1761140372.0,fasting,4,1.0,False

There were a few different kinds of seeds, each slightly different in size and color. 

“And this one?”, the military man asked with a brown-greenish seed between his thumb and index finger. 

“That’s Longjing tea, once granted the status of Imperial Tea by the Kangxi Emperor”, the merchant glowingly informed the man. 

“And does it grow faster or slower than the coffee seeds in the other crates?”

“Both grow at a comparable rate, which depends on the weather.”

“Now, your claim that the people in Wuhan are willing to pay staggering amounts for tea and coffee, how can you prove it?”

The merchant reached into her pocket and showed the military man a black-and-white picture of a grand house with an ornate roof and a queue of wagons in front of it. 

“This, right here, is the house of Huang Zhang. He had a measly small tea plantation in Hunan twenty years ago. The profits of only one year’s harvest were enough to hire thirty more workers. Next year, he could double his farm. Year after that, he had to buy all the carts and horses in his hometown just to meet demand.” 

The military man crossed his arms. “So the market is already saturated?” 

The merchant shook her head. “Not even close. Because it’s not just Wuhan. All of Zhonggou wants to put these leaves in their drink. If you plant these, everyone will learn who you are and will want to bring their wealth to the clique. I think this is what your sage was hinting at.” 

“This sounds good to me. I’ll put in a good word with general Cao. Let’s hope that soon we have tea and coffee growing along the banks of the Jiulong river, and silver in both our pockets. And in the state coffers too, of course.”

The place is small.  There was a line.  But it moved well.   Everyone was patient (staff and customers).  It has about 3 or 4 tables and stools near the front.  All which had customers enjoying themselves.

Was unsure what to get, had no clue.  But the lady who took my order was very patient.  Got coffee (the smallest size is 12 ounces).  Asked to get it light and sweet.  This coffee was STRONG.  It woke me up.  By the way they put in 4 heap Fuls of sugar.  Not a complaint.  Just want y'all to know.  They also areate their milk, had carafes with paddles in them, assuming they do it by hand.  This is one of the better drip coffees I've had.

Got something called a Pandebono.  It reminded me of corn bread, but the flavor was very mild and much softer.  It was fire with the coffee!  Also, got Pan de quejo.  It was very good.  Not too salty but could have used more of the cheese.  And lastly (i forgot the name) got a bread that had cheese in it, but it was slightly sweet.  It was very good but could have used more of it.

Y'all I felt i had robbed these folks.  I paid just under 5 dollars.  When, I return will try some of the breads made of cassava and guava.  This place is a gem.  I hope this place survives the impending toonification of the Heights.

I pay it forward as much as I could as well to other co-workers or people outside our team that I talk to within the office. However, it also doesn’t have to be something financial. A smile, something verbal, and a little sense of happiness helps too! 

One if the bus drivers were out last week and greeted me with such joy this morning welcoming me that it set my morning to such a good start. 

Like I said, WE ALL GOTTA LOOKOUT FOR EACH OTHER. Pay the little things forward. Some people have more than others even in this time of need. Thanks for coming to my FedTalk. ",44,1761139937.0,fednews,5,0.96,False

I also like Asian women too please message me also!

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

Spent a lot of time with her over lunches and coffees as a colleague earlier. And we ended up having a lot of similar tastes, it felt like this is it. But then I moved cities to start my own venture, but we kept in touch. Finally, when I felt we both are comfortable with each other and enjoy each others company. Felt this way only the third time in my life and I mustered some courage to ask her out. While she agreed, the problem is I have been struggling with psoriasis for quite sometime and due to me being perennially anxious, uncertain about venture outcomes, unable to sleep at night, waking up in the middle of the night and staying awake for hours took a toll on my body and my inflammation increased to an extent to become noticeable. Not only now I feel so drained and worried all the time but physically also my condition will never let me get intimate as she might not accept it, not that that’s what I’m seeking but hey at some point sometime it might be the case.

Japan's power on social media comes from its ability to leverage its unique culture, particularly its global **""soft power""** influence through anime, manga, and games, as well as its significant domestic digital infrastructure. GOOGLE researches

# But actually what was happend ?

According to Ciaran Varley, producer and journalist of BBC which is uploaded the storytelling of Stacy Dooley whose around the year of 2017 has a very wee glimpse of Tokyo, Japan for seeing the truth and being in dark side of streets and the violence of making-money way the producer earn from pornography which is show how the humanity is not doing as work as the civilized people which is in some way is quite heart-breaking.

There’s a street in Tokyo known as ""JK alley"", or ""schoolgirl alley"", from the Japanese Joshi Kosei, meaning high school girl.

There, teenagers in school uniform sell their time to passers-by, while their minders hover in the background.

Men pay to hold hands, go for a walk or have a cup of coffee with the girls. Some even pay to sleep on a girl's lap.

This is all legitimate, **above Board and Legal !**

In the new BBC Three documentary, *Young sex for sale in Japan* (See the BBC) , Stacey Dooley visits a JK cafe in Tokyo.

“In this bar, £35 will get you forty minutes with a girl of your choice and unlimited booze,” she says.

In some cafes, men can also pay for ""walking dates"" – time with the girls away from the cafe. What happens in that time is up to the girls and their clients.

customer shows Stacey his favorite girl, a **17-year-old** with long, light brown hair and a thick fringe. He likes her **“because she’s good at talking dirty, but she pretends to be pure”.**

Another customer tells Stacey, “the age gap thing for some people is off-putting but, in Japan, maybe it’s our culture - our attitude is quite different”.

It’s estimated that nearly 5000 genuine schoolgirls work in these (legal) cafes in Japan.

Until 2014 child pornography was legal to own in Japan. The law has changed, but the sexualisation of minors continues. ( funny isn’t it ? )

""Chaku Ero"", which means ""erotically clothed"" is a kind of soft porn - it doesn’t involve nudity, but it can get very, very close and is often overtly sexual. ( very fitted and extra bikini underwear in some way maybe nothing though )

Stacey asks a Chaku Ero producer (who wanted to remain anonymous) how young the girls in his shoots are.

“My youngest was **six years old,**” he says. “We filmed her in her bathing costume playing with some toys. **Her mum was standing behind the camera holding her favorite toy so she would face the camera.”**

He makes much more money filming children than older girls. The DVD of the six-year-old made him “Around five million yen (£35,500),” he says. “The senior high school girls will make about one million (£7000)”.

When Stacey asks how he would feel if someone had shot his own 16-year-old daughter the way he shot that six-year-old girl, he pauses.

**“I would force both of us to commit a joint suicide,”** he says. ( :) )

“Are you serious?” Stacey asks him.

“Yes.""

As long as Chaku Ero photos don’t show the child’s naked genitals, buttocks or chest, **it isn’t categorised as child pornography.**

But, according to Kazuko Ito, a Human Rights Lawyer who is trying to challenge this definition, “Chaku Ero is child pornography. That’s the reality.”

As Stacey says, “one of the things that slaps you in the face when you arrive in Japan is their obsession with everything cute”.

She believes there is an issue that goes **“much deeper than child porn”**.

Domestic sales of manga comics topped **over £2 billion** in Japan in 2015.

""Lolicon"" (short for ""Lolita complex"") is the Japanese term for manga and anime featuring sexually explicit images of children. It can involve extreme violence, rape and incest.

The Japanese Government tried to ban these images too, but artists and publishers resisted , external **on the grounds of free speech**. Dan Kanemitsu is one of those who argues against the ban. He’s spent 20 years translating Japanese manga.

“There is a child being harmed, on the one hand, and then there is a depiction of a child being harmed. There is a big difference between the two,” he says.

He **disagrees** with the idea that this kind of material could normalise the sexual abuse of children in Japan and even argues that the comics provide a “venting mechanism” for those with paedophilic fantasies.

The head of the juvenile section at Japan’s National Police Agency ( NPA ) says that JK cafes will no longer be able to have girls under eighteen serving customers (**but that doesn’t mean they won’t still be dressed as schoolgirls)**. ( potato, potahto Huh? )

With laws around around Chaku Ero, JK cafes and sexually explicit manga continuing to inhabit a grey area, you have to ask, **is Japan turning a blind eye to pedophilia ? )**

I’ve had some kind of cold virus the last few days. Ignored it bc what else can I do. Last night I felt super exhausted but thought it was bc I exercised and was sore. Today I woke up feeling like I’ve been hit by a bus. All the symptoms I can imagine all at once but especially weakness. I ordered DayQuil DoorDash but it never came so I just cancelled the order. I have a babysitter coming at 915, she doesn’t care if we’re sick she’ll still come. My husband cut some fruit up for my kids, left me toast and coffee, and ran out the door. He works an office job and can easily be a few hours late. I needed him to stay until the babysitter comes but he just ran away basically. I physically can’t care for my kids, they’re 1 and 3 and the 1 year old won’t even watch tv or anything, all he wants to do is for me to hold him and be standing or walking. I can’t do it. I feel so angry at my husband for not checking on me to make sure I was able to last til 915. It was only 2 hours. I know this sounds very spoiled and petty but I’ve been listening to my baby just cry it out for an hour now and I’m going to pass out or throw up. I wish someone would just check on me or help me. My whole life is caring for my family and no one checks on me. My husband told me to eat some raspberry jam in black tea or eat this weird butter ghee thing his mom made for our toddler last week when he had pneumonia in the hospital. My parents live 30 mins away but they’re horrible people and we have no relationship with them. I have a mom friend and whenever her and her family get sick I bring them soup or a small treat for her toddler. They’re sick now and I was going to do that again but I realized they’ve never once did that for me. So I’m not doing it. Times like this just highlight how alone I am. 

Never in a million years would or could my husband be left with our kids by himself while he’s sick like this. But I’m supposed to just do it. ",1,1761139560.0,sahm,0,1.0,False

A resume is a visual expression of your professional value. It helps people see, recognize, and trust your skills. But in the professional world, what’s even more powerful than a resume is your credibility.

When you build a strong personal brand, your work, your ideas, and your value quietly open doors for you even when you are not there.

Building your personal brand is way more effective than applying for 100 jobs.

Here’s what happened as a result:

· Got a collaboration offer from a startup founder who wanted to work with me.

· Received 2 full-time offers without sending a single resume.

· Landed my first client helping her build a personal digital identity and improve her LinkedIn profile.

· Now people book coffee chats with me every week.

I stopped chasing people. I started attracting them.

Your personal image matters just as much. I used APOB. I simply dropped my photos in, and it helped me build a clean, consistent personal look. It’s more professional than a phone selfie and much cheaper than hiring a photographer. Now my LinkedIn looks more real and professional, and people instantly get who I am and what I do.

Here’s what actually worked for me:

1.Build a brand that reflects your digital self, visuals matter more than you think.

2.Create content that attracts same-minded people, not just recruiters.

3.Network intentionally, focus on value not quantity.

4.Learn how to express your story in coffee chats.

   I ended up getting gifted White Sharks, Shiro Utsuri, Cubaris Penguins, and Armadillidium Gestroi from my gf, shes the best and I dont deserve her ( got her a coffee mug for her birthday last year )

   I have some other isopods, Dairy Cow and Spanish Orange, mixed with an army of local basic variety (not sure the species Eastern Canada)  this crew are mostly for clean up and lizard snacks, they live with my roaches and my superworm breeding colony, two giant bins.  

   I love all my critters but I was especially stoked to have fancy isopodes because I wanted some for years (still want a ton of species)  So we set them all up in their own bins, moss, charcoal, dirt, calcium, springtails, good yummy decayed wood, leaflitter, wet side, dry side, proper ventilation.. tried to make it perfect, ya know.

    I WAS NOT expecting the White Sharks to be so tiny, it's horrifying, I was so afraid they would never be seen again.  But after a couple check ups I seen they were doing good and I relaxed. I read up about them and some people said they end up in all their bins, which I though was wild because they seem so delicate.  

   Fast forward to 2 days ago (I moved homes) I was checking on my superworm bin and I looked under a piece of bark and low and behold there was a little white shark just chillen there, living his best life amongst the hoard of hundreds of other clean up crew bugs.   

   I have no Idea how it got in there because my bins are as secure as can be (i have double mesh on all the vent holes to prevent fruit flies) AND my new fancy isopodes are not even in the same room as the super worm bins.  I've only opened the white sharks bin like 3-4 times max since I got them, and I haven't really taken anything out from it except maybe a moldy leaf.   So yeah, I'm confused and impressed.

Me 33F, Haven't been diagnosed but the more I research about ADHD the more I feel like I could have it. At the same time I also feel like something is missing. When I read about other people symptoms I almost never relate (maybe I am hyper masking? Or always been high functioning?) but I know that I have something going on for myself. Recently, I started reading about OCD and that makes way more sense to me, but I read that between the two theres a big overlap and the same symptoms can have different motives. Also 20-30% of OCD can have ADHD as well 🫠 might have both, but I never really shared what happens inside my head with no one cos I don't think people around me would understand (it took 15 years for my mom to understand my ED, my dad still doesn't get it and other people think isn't real). Also, due to dysfunctional family dynamics I am pretty sure I at least have C-PTSD.

These are all the ""things"" that make me think there's something going on.
- Biting nails. I do this since I was a kid. It got worse as a teen, I started biting/picking the cuticles and skin around it until it bleeds and it gets painful and inflamed. It only gets better if I get hard gel, but still picking every now and then.
- Binge eating disorder. Started when I was in primary school. It lasted for 20years. It slowly stopped during/after the therapy, but still to this day I use overeating as coping mechanisms. Sometimes, when I eat food I love, I literally can't stop myself until I finish the whole thing.
- Constant rumination/overthinking about everything. Especially social interaction where I did/said something dumb or embarrassing. I would keep humiliating myself on my head for hours. Sometimes I can't even switch my brain off and just got to sleep.
- Body dismorphia related to ED
- Intrusive thoughts. I constantly have an internal monologue, it almost never stops. Sometimes it's my own voice. Sometimes it's the little ""monster"" I have inside talking to me, it usually puts me down or tells me weird and mean stuff. Sometimes I just see people on the street and I think really gross stuff about them and that make feel disgusted about what I just thought.
- I talk out loud to myself when I am alone. I have full blown convo like I talking to someone else, and I always say ""we"".
- when I read, write or type I say out loud inside my head what I am read or trying to write.
- Obsession about specific topics or situations. Ex: I got diagnosed with PCOS 3 years, since then pretty much every single day I need to search info about it, about the symptoms I have about how to cope with the symptoms in a natural way. I would watch videos, read medical articles, watch tons of reels about it. I would costantly thinking about it, especially how to manage it. 
- Limerence. Don't even make me start on this. I did and said the most embarsssing stuff to guys BC of it.
- Rejection sensory disorder. Related to non reciprocated limerence. this also applies to friendship, always feeling like no one really put enough energy into me compared to way I do and I feel jealous they have other friends or I feel like they do cool stuff with other people but with me is always the last minute unplanned coffee chat. Unless, I am the one organizing the cool activity to do together.
- Mentally restless. Sometimes I feel like my brain could explode from how fast and overheating it gets overthinking all that nonsense. Especially when I have Limerence or when I think how catastrophic a past social interaction was.
- Anxious/irritated if things are not as planned or expected. I went to NY recently for the first time in my life, the city wasn't how I expected it, and I didnt like the hotel and didn't like a few other things. And just because of that, I made sure to hate the vacation all the way. just because things weren't as expected, I couldn't enjoy any of it. In mind head I was like ""what's the point?"" And then, I was mad at myself because the trip was expensive and I wasnt loving it like I was expecting to.
- executive dysfunction and procrastination: sometimes especially when I have a lot to get done at home, I start creating a mental list of all the things I need to do and sometines I get stuck about the right order to maxime time or the the taks priority order. I get so overwhelmed and stressed about that in the end I just don't do anything I planned or I pracrastinate so much that even if I start doing things, I don't manage to finish cos I started late.
- I have an admin job and every now and then (but consistently) I make careless mistakes ex: saying that my exec is free Dec 6 at 2pm and then I realised I was looking Dec 5 instead. Or I read quickly and email and idk how I skip one line and I miss on info and then when I reply to the email I providing wrong info due to my lack of context. Sometimes when people send me a lot of messages all together in a chat, I miss to read some of them and they ask me why I don't respond to all of their texts. I feel so stupid about it, about this and I think that these people think I am so stupid (especially at work and due to my role).
- if I am reading a book and I underline something I will erase the line until I feel the line is right. Sometimes I erase so much the paper/print get damaged. Same when I need to take notes, I will scrap the paper and start again until I like my writing or the writing layout is tidy enough on the paper.
- people can't sit on my bed with outdoor clothes cos I leave in London and ""tube"" clothes on my bed is Forbidden. my BF makes fun of me for this.
- I always been in toxic relationships before my current one. This is my first healthy relationship and I am realizing I can be controlling. Ex: I gave him my house keys going out cos my evening purse is too small, and I loudly told him ""please don't lose them"". Or we ate brownies, and I asked him if he brushed his teeth before going out, I always get chocolate in mine when I eat them. I instantly apologised cos I know my BF is not a ma child, it just me being weird.
- I often bump and stumble into stuff, as a teen I was doing it all the time. When I am sick or tried I get super clumsy. ex: I want to fill up my kettle and somehow managed to spill all the water on the countertop. 
- I would be often late because I want my makeup/hair looking a certain way. I would redo my eyeliner 2-3 I'm a row time because I am not satisfied with it and then I get so frustrated and angry that sometimes I even cried.
- I struggled a lot in the past, dealing with my family when I was young living at home, having an ED, moving to a different country and trying to build a career. I finally feel like I got to a point of mental and economic stability but still I am not able to relax and just be! I have a stable job, a nice flat, I am dating a very nice guy and I am slowly getting my health in check, but sometimes I still feel depressed, cry for no reason, feeling like I am not doing enough ex: house not clean enough, didn't go enough times to the gym, I really want to change job but it has been hard in the current climate and market trying to find new opportunities, and I will obsess myself staying hours on LinkedIn applying and reaching out to recruiters.

I always wonder why my PCOS inflammation doesn't go away.... I might got a clue after re reading this 🤦🏻‍♀️

Whether you’re a frequent flyer, business traveler, or family on vacation, VIP parking offers unmatched convenience and comfort from the moment you arrive. Here’s what you can expect when you upgrade your airport parking experience.

# 1. Hassle-Free Arrival and Departure

Say goodbye to long walks from distant parking lots or waiting for crowded shuttles. With VIP parking, you drive directly to the terminal where a professional valet will meet you. Your car is parked safely for you, and when you return, it’s brought right back to the same spot—ready to go.

# 2. Time Efficiency

For busy travelers, time is the most valuable asset. VIP airport parking eliminates the need to search for a space or wait in long queues. Drop-offs and pick-ups take only minutes, giving you more time for check-in or a relaxing coffee before your flight.

# 3. Superior Safety and Security

Every vehicle parked in VIP facilities is monitored 24/7 through CCTV and on-site staff. Most services also provide insurance coverage, ensuring your car remains safe while you’re away. This peace of mind is one of the most appreciated benefits among regular users.

# 4. Personalized Service

Expect more than just parking. Many VIP services include car washing, detailing, or battery checks while you’re away. Some even provide luggage assistance, ensuring a seamless handover that feels effortless from start to finish.

# 5. Stress-Free Returns

After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to navigate through a cold, dark parking lot. VIP parking services ensure your vehicle is ready and waiting, warmed up in winter or cooled down in summer—so you can drive off comfortably.

**Meet and Greet Heathrow** services set the standard for premium airport parking by offering all the above conveniences with an added touch of professionalism and care. These tailored parking solutions are perfect for travelers seeking reliability and comfort without the typical airport chaos. Whether you’re jetting off for business or leisure, choosing a meet-and-greet-style VIP service ensures your journey begins and ends effortlessly, letting you focus on what truly matters—enjoying the trip.",1,1761138882.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1od7xkf,https://i.redd.it/qmehagyxxnwf1.jpeg,Got the P!!!,"Got the P last week and wanted to share my experience. My journey has been quite honestly a mess but I’m super proud of myself :))

I originally had planned to take step1 in October of 2024 (in my fourth year of med school) but was not confident with my scores (had only hit 70 once and was told from friends that a minimum of two scores of 70 is safe). I couldn’t postpone by exam any further bc I couldn’t afford to miss any more classes, so I decided to wait until after I finished my fourth year exams. (You can see my previous post, I was a wreck and extremely under-confident.)

After my fourth year exams, I decided to take time off to re-prepare for step1. There was a gap of about 7 months. I ended up taking 4.5 months to prep. I used the following resources: uworld (did about 60% as I had done it the previous year as well), the mnemosyne Anki deck (a deck based off FA), sketchy for micro and pharm, verifiedsmoothbrain pixorize Anki deck for biochem (not really necessary imo as the pathways weren’t really tested on my exam), and Randy Neil for Biostats. I had used melhman extensively the previous year I was prepping (both his pdfs and his question bank series on YouTube) but this time the only PDFs I did were: immunology, arrows, ethics, biostats, genetics, risk factors, and renal. I used dirty medicine for ethics as well and found his communications question video extremely helpful. I also listened to the DIP risk factors episode, don’t really know how much it helped tho. I practiced 20 of the SOAP style questions with free trial on amboss, just to familiarize myself with how they looked.

I started doing my nbmes 2 months before my exam. I was so worried that I would remember the questions bc I had taken the exams last year but honestly I only remembered a handful. My only new exams were the uwsa1 and 2 and nbme 32. I told myself if I pass these exams then I have to sit for the real deal. The uwsas were horrible for me (esp uwsa1 bc it had so much biochem) but a 63.5% and 65% got me a high chance of passing so 🤷‍♀️. My strategy was to take an nbme every 4 days. I would pick 2 of my least scoring chapters and review those. I would also go through all the incorrects first and make a document to categorize my mistakes into: knowledge gap, retention/ memory, problem solving, time, fatigue (taken from another Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/s/OpxT0XFKtr). If my mistake fell into knowledge gap or memory, I would write a line or two of what my knowledge gap was or what factoid I failed to remember. This doc was approx 20 pages long for each nbme, but it what I believe helped me the most. I would review it before every nbme I took.

I booked Free120 at the testing center a few days before my exam, definitely recommend if you’re an anxious test taker like me!

Day before the exam: I was freaking out so I put all my scores into the amboss score predictor and it said 99% chance of passing so I decided to trust it with my life. I reviewed a little bit of genetics, ethics, risk factors, immunodeficiencies, and a few topics from each chap I would always forget. I stopped studying at around 7pm and got was in bed by 9pm. To be honest with you, I was so anxious I don’t even know if I slept at all. I just closed my eyes and refused to open them until my alarm rang. Not falling asleep the day before the exam was one of my biggest fears and it happened. I would recommend training your body to wake up the same time everyday and start solving questions at 8am (bc that’s when the exam starts). I unfortunately did not do this and my sleep schedule was a mess. That being said, IF you can’t fall asleep the day before, DON’T FREAK OUT!!! The adrenaline will carry you!!!

Day of the exam: I got out of bed at 530 am, took a shower, and ate a pretty heavy breakfast (an omelette, salad, and a cup of coffee). I put ice cubes in a ziplock bag and kept putting them on my face bc I was so worried I would fall asleep during the exam.

The actual exam: I felt like the stems were similar to uworld length, with approx 15-20% of them being longer, with nbme concepts. I would recommend memorizing the lab values bc they just give an entire table of lab values (most of them being within the normal range) and only a few of them (the ones pertaining to the question) being abnormal. My strategy for every question was to read the last line, then the options, then skim through the question stem. Instead of reading through all the lab values, I should’ve only read the lab values pertaining to the system of the question (which I would’ve determined from the last line of the stem and the options) instead of trying to read through all the lab values— this is were I lost most of my time imo and why I finished half of the blocks with no time to spare and the other half with only 5 min.  I got 5-6 ethics questions a block and they were kinda confusing tbh. Also, do all the nbmes well bc I got one exact repeat, like the same exact question lol. My first two blocks were hell, I felt like I was guessing EVERYTHING, but I told myself if I’ve come this far then the only thing to do is to keep going!!! I took a break after every block of my exam to go to the bathroom and wash my face, it really helped my reset and forget about the previous block. The second half of my exam was waaay better compared to the first half.

Felt okay after the exam. The questions all felt familiar albeit lengthy and I just kept telling myself that I would pass. I would literally close my eyes and try to visualize the pass scorecard with my name on it lool

My final piece of advice: if I can do it so can you!!! Eat healthy, exercise, sleep adequately everyday and BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!!! Confidence is key (I would literally say to myself in the mirror during my exam “I am going to pass” repeatedly).

1od7waw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1od7waw/the_follower_count/,The Follower Count,"My sister disappeared the day she hit one million followers.

Emma had been grinding on social media for years—lifestyle content, makeup tutorials, the usual stuff. Then three months ago, her numbers exploded overnight. Thousands of followers per day. Brands were throwing money at her.

""I don't even know where they're all coming from,"" she laughed over coffee. ""My analytics just say 'Unknown Source.'""

She showed me her phone. Her follower count was climbing in real-time. 847,392... 847,395... 847,401...

""That's not normal,"" I said.

""Who cares? I'm finally making it.""

But Emma started changing. She posted constantly—every hour, then every thirty minutes, then every ten. She stopped sleeping. Her eyes developed dark circles that no filter could hide.

""They're watching,"" she whispered when I confronted her. ""If I don't post, the count goes down. And when it goes down...""

She showed me her arm. Scratches. Deep ones.

""I thought I was dreaming, but I checked my security camera. Nothing. No one was there. But every time I lose followers, I wake up with more marks.""

I begged her to delete her accounts. She refused.

""I'm so close to a million. Just a little more.""

The night she hit 1,000,000, I got a call from her doorman. Her apartment was open, lights on, phone on the bed, still recording a livestream of an empty room.

Emma was gone.

But her account is still active.

She posts every day at 3:33 AM. The photos are always the same—a dark room with a single chair. And in each photo, the chair gets slightly closer to the camera.

Her follower count is still climbing. 1,247,392... 1,247,395...

And each new follower has the same profile picture: a black square.

The same username: ""Unknown.""

Last night, I made a mistake. I clicked on one of the profiles.

It took me to a livestream. Emma's face, pressed against a camera in the dark, mouth open in a silent scream. Behind her, thousands of faces, all watching.

The stream title read: ""847 days until release.""

Then I realized—that was her old follower count. The day before she blew up.

This morning, I woke up to a notification.

Emma's account had tagged me in a post.

The photo showed my bedroom. My bed. Me sleeping.

The caption read: ""Next milestone: 2,000,000.""

My phone shows I gained 10,000 followers overnight.

I don't have any social media accounts.

At least, I didn't think I did.

But when I check now, there it is. My face. My photos. Posts I never made.

1od7ub0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cofounderhunt/comments/1od7ub0/looking_for_a_ukbased_cofounder_for/,Looking for a UK-Based Co-Founder for Automotive-Focused IT Business,"I'm the founder of an IT services business that’s focuses on the automotive industry. I’m looking for a co-founder to help me take this business to market. 

**The Backstory** 

I’ve spent over 20 years in enterprise IT, 70% of my career is within automotive. I’ve worked with major players like Motorpoint, Pendragon, and Sytner, building everything from auction platforms, major customer facing websites, finance proposal systems, and integrations with lenders like Black Horse and Evolution Funding. I know the space inside out — not just the tech, but the sales side and more importantly how finance works. In the UK, without finance there would be no industry – its the life blood of automotive. 

In addition to just offering services, I also built an Enterprise search platform called S2Search which was designed purely for the automotive industry. Think of vehicle search but on steroids.  S2Search will be ready for market in the next month – I'm using the time I have between contracts to refine and update it. It’s designed to improve vehicle search UX, support multiple data formats (AutoTrader, Motors, etc.), and track every user interaction into an insights dashboard which can be used by decision makes and buyers as business intelligence to help make informed stock buying decisions.

At the end of 2021, I left my full-time role to start this business. At that time I had a business partner who I had known for many years and worked with at previous jobs. He was technical like me. We were working together at the same place where i got him the job. we'd agreed to go into business together and then resign in December 2021 and start it January 2022, new year new business. But when it came down to it, he just didn't have the balls. Hes still had the same job I got him. 

**The Journey So Far** 

I started with about £24k in savings and spent the first couple of months trying to drum up business on LinkedIn. But, I’m not a sales guy. My background is in enterprise IT, architecture, and delivery. I’ve worked with stakeholders, product owners, C-suite and led teams, but I’ve never done cold outreach or Business development. 

After two months of trying to generate leads and burning through cash at £2k a month for mortgage bills, etc , and with my co-founder still not resigning and starting to ghost me, I pivoted. I picked up contract work — and it was boom times. I landed multiple contracts and earned more than I ever had before. After 3 months from resigning from my full-time job i was making 4x per month than i was previously. So at that stage for me it was mission accomplished. None of the contracts were related to the business which wasn't ideal, but the money was, so that carried me through the last few years. One of the contracts i got was because of the experience i had with enterprise search due to the experience of building S2Search, but now those contracts have ended, and I’m ready to refocus on the business. 

**What are the goals** 

I want to secure work from the industry I'm targeting – i.e. automotive. However, i do know that as a single tech only founder, that will be a struggle without a co-founder that has skills in business development, marketing and sales. I also want to bring S2Search to market – so the business can offer services, and it also has a product. 

**What I’m Looking For** 

I’m looking for someone who: 

Has business development, marketing, sales, experience ideally in automotive or the automotive finance industry 

Understands the automotive industry and sees the opportunity here 

Is UK-based — ideally somewhere central so we can meet regularly – I’ve been remote for five years now in what I call my “luxury prison.” I’m done with remote. I want to collaborate face-to-face, build together, and succeed together. 

**Why This Matters** 

My view is that there’s a real gap in the market for IT professionals who truly understand automotive. I’ve built the tech, I know the industry, and I’ve got the vision. But I need someone who can help bring this to market — both the services and the platform. 

If you’re someone who’s got the experience, and the belief that this industry is ripe for innovation, let’s talk. I’m open to meeting up, grabbing a coffee, and seeing if we click.

I never thought I’d say this, but I’m angry at my mother — the woman who worked two jobs to raise me alone. But what she did after my dad’s death… I still can’t process it.

Dad and Mom divorced when I was twelve. He wasn’t perfect, but he never stopped supporting me. When he passed last year, I was devastated — until his lawyer called. Dad had left me his entire savings — around ""$180,000"" — in a trust fund for when I turned twenty-five.

Except… when my birthday came, there was nothing left.

I thought there’d been a mistake, so I called the lawyer. That’s when he said, awkwardly, “Your mother already withdrew it. She said it was for you — to pay for your future.”

My heart dropped. I confronted her, shaking. She didn’t even deny it. She just looked me dead in the eye and said, “I’m your mother. You owe me your life. That money was for everything I sacrificed.”

She used it to pay off her mortgage, buy a new car, and help my younger half-brother “get on his feet.”

I screamed, cried, begged her to see what she’d done. She stayed calm, sipping coffee, like I was being dramatic. She said, “You’ll understand when you’re a parent.”

I moved out that week. I blocked her. But every now and then, I see her posting “family first” quotes on Facebook — pretending everything’s fine.

People tell me to forgive her. But how do you forgive someone who stole not just money — but the last thing your father gave you?

I’m not sure what hurts more: losing the inheritance or realizing my mom saw me as debt she needed to collect.

Sometimes, love isn’t broken by distance. It’s broken by ""betrayal disguised as sacrifice"".

1od7oly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/1od7oly/yet_another_gear_question_tent_related/,Yet another gear question (tent related),"I’ve been on a few short backpacking trips, but nothing crazy. I have lots of experience with regular camping.

I want to start easing into solo backpacking trips, maybe bring my dog if I can get him to agree to wear a pack.

I’m thinking just weekend trips, 2.5 season, maybe 20 miles a day max. 

I plan on being pretty light in the food area, maybe not even being a cooking system (might bring a match and a pot to boil some water for coffee but that’s about it). Everything else will be cold soak or ready to eat. This just matches me already, most of the time I feel like eating is a huge waste of time and I wish I could just inject it somehow. 

I already have a Big Agnes Rapide SL and I assume that will work for this just fine.

So, tents… of course I’ve been looking at reviews and learning all about DCF and the various trade-offs, and for my distance and plans, it seems like the downsides would outweigh the benefits. So now I’m looking at traditional 2 wall light tents.


I was looking at the Big Agnes Copper Spur 2p, but it is kinda heavy. But how much does that matter for a weekend trip?

But if you start going lighter than that, it seems all roads lead to Durston X-Mid 2p, and for me, not the DCF version. The price seems comparable to other options in the arena, but the features and space seem better.

Am I missing something here? Any other things I should be thinking about? I’m definitely a buy once cry once kind of guy, and while I say I’ll be doing short trips for now, that may change once I start getting into it (and if I don’t, I’m not afraid to turn around and sell my stuff for a discount to someone who will)",2,1761138193.0,CampingGear,3,1.0,False

1od7n8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1od7n8i/aita_for_telling_my_dads_entire_congregation_he/,AITA for telling my dad's entire congregation he left me rotting in foster care while playing perfect Christian family man?,"I put my biological father on blast at his church fundraiser last weekend and now half my family is calling me evil.

So here's the deal. I'm 28 now. When I was six, my mom got pregnant with me before marriage. My dad was already married to someone else. Yep, I was the affair baby. My mom died when I was four from cancer. After she passed, I bounced around foster care for years.

Here's the part that makes me sick. My dad never claimed me. Not once. He had this whole perfect Christian family thing going on. Wife, two kids, youth pastor at their mega church. Apparently having a bastard daughter from an affair would ruin his reputation. So he just let me rot in the system.

But my grandparents, his parents, they knew about me the whole time. They would visit me sometimes at my foster homes. Bring me presents on my birthday. Act like they cared. They told everyone I was their cousin's kid who had drug problems. Said they were helping out of charity. Even told ME that story until I was old enough to demand the truth.

I aged out of foster care at 18. Got myself through community college. Built a decent life with no help from any of them. Meanwhile, my dad became some big shot associate pastor. His legitimate kids got cars, college funds, family vacations. I got nothing.

Last year my grandmother got sick. Started talking about wanting to make amends before she died. She reached out and we met for coffee. She cried and apologized. Said she was ashamed they abandoned me but my dad threatened to cut them off if they ever acknowledged me publicly.

She asked if I wanted to meet my half siblings. I said no. They grew up with everything while I had nothing. But she kept pushing. Said they deserved to know they had a sister.

I told her I'd think about it. Then she died three months later.

At her funeral, I showed up. My dad nearly had a heart attack when he saw me. His wife had no idea who I was. My half siblings looked confused. The whole church community was there watching.

My grandfather gave this eulogy about family and legacy. Talked about how my grandmother loved all her grandchildren equally. That pissed me off. Because she didn't. She abandoned me to protect her son's image.

During the reception, my aunt cornered me and asked why I came. She was drunk and mean about it. Said I wasn't welcome. That my grandmother wouldn't have wanted me there causing drama.

Something in me snapped.

I walked up to the microphone they had set up for people sharing memories. I introduced myself by my full name. Then I said, ""For those who don't know me, I'm the pastor's daughter. The one he abandoned in foster care because acknowledging my existence would hurt his ministry career.""

The room went dead silent.

My dad turned red. His wife looked like she might pass out. I kept talking. Told them about the foster homes. The birthdays alone. The times my grandparents visited me but pretended I was just some charity case. How they all chose his reputation over a child's wellbeing.

I thanked my grandmother for finally feeling guilty at the end. Said it was too little too late. Then I left.

The fallout has been nuclear. My dad's church put him on leave pending an investigation. His wife is apparently filing for divorce. My half siblings found me on social media and they're torn between wanting to know me and hating me for destroying their family.

My grandfather called me a vindictive b\*\*\*h. Said I ruined my father's life out of spite. That my grandmother would be heartbroken I used her funeral for revenge.

My aunt sent a long text about forgiveness and moving on. Said I should have handled this privately instead of publicly humiliating everyone. That I'm no better than they are now.

Some cousins are on my side though. Said the truth needed to come out. That I had every right to expose what they did.

But I keep wondering if I went too far. Yeah, they abandoned me. Yeah, they lied for decades. But did I have to blow up their lives at a funeral? My grandmother is dead. She can't defend herself. And my half siblings didn't do anything wrong, they were just kids who didn't know I existed.

Part of me feels justified. They chose comfort over doing the right thing for years. Why should I protect them now?

But another part of me wonders if I just became the villain in their story instead of getting actual closure.

So reddit, am I the asshole for exposing my family's lies at my grandmother's funeral?

Looking for some advice on how to handle this fairly and kindly.

We have a wonderful part-time nanny who works three days a week while I’m at work. She’s been amazing and truly such a blessing to our family. Last week our little one was sick with a cold, and this week our nanny came down with a fever and was diagnosed with strep (she saw a doctor and was prescribed antibiotics).

We don’t have a formal contract—just an agreed daily rate—so there’s no policy in place for sick days. Our backup care was also unavailable this week, so my mother-in-law ended up coming to help instead.

My husband feels we shouldn’t pay for days she doesn’t work, since that could set a tricky precedent. But I feel bad, since it’s very possible our LO passed the illness to her, and we didn’t have to spend extra on backup care anyway. I also want to make sure she feels valued and appreciated, because she really is an important part of our family.

Would you:
Pay her for the full week she missed?
Offer partial pay as a kind gesture?
Do something like a gift card to her favorite coffee spot instead?

ETA: Thanks, all. Clearly I have good intentions here and want to make sure we do the right thing. For those of you that didn’t see that I’m sorry. You’ve all confirmed what I was already thinking! ",12,1761137505.0,Nanny,34,0.73,False

So I decided to try a ""The Expanse"" themed run. I used [this Rocinante deck plan](https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/21/21449127/ships-of-the-expanse-rpg-book-rocinante-deck-plan/). Of course there is no tower block design, ladders, or flip-and-burn physics in Rimworld, but I tried to copy the layout as closely as possible while still having it function as a decent gravship. There's no research bench since I completed the tech tree, but it used to be in Ops. I added a brig, which I don't think the OG Roci had. The water tanks in the show would've been mostly for reaction mass, but here they're mostly for hauling water from the planet up to my orbital bases. The point defense cannons are simulated with clusters of plasteel turrets and the uranium slug turrets stand in for the railgun. (No torpedoes unfortunately.)

DLC/mod list:

* I don't have Royalty or Biotech. Enabled Odyssey (obviously) and Ideology (without ideoligion).
* I have Anomaly but didn't enable it, which in retrospect was a mistake because >!it would've done a nice job as a stand-in for the Protomolecule!<.
* Dubs Bad Hygiene, because if we can't have a fusion reactor, the next best thing is poop-fueled thrusters. Also a ship without bathrooms could never feel like home.
* Vanilla Brewing Expanded and Coffee/Tea: mostly so Holden could have his espresso machine, which unfortunately I forgot to reinstall for this photo. Later I started a massive whiskey distillery at an asteroid base. I edited the save file to change the name of the quest so I could have it show up as Pallas Station on the map.
* Vanilla Expanded Apparel, Plants, More Plants, Succulents, Furniture, Spacer Furniture

After defeating the Mechhive we retired to the Belt (orbit) and took over an abandoned orbital platform which was renamed Tycho Station by editing the save file.

The Roci docks on the left. The platform's life support system provides such an absurd amount of power that I still haven't managed to use it all. At this point my colony wealth is so absurd I've gotten bored, even though I haven't fully finished renovating the station yet (you can still see some of the original dining rooms with wood floors).",1,1761137007.0,RimWorld,0,0.67,False

1od73lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1od73lo/a1c_and_glucose_weight_loss_food_and_health/,"A1C and glucose, weight loss, food and health anxiety","I'm male, 45, and was 270 lbs in May. Have been that weight for at least 3 years, when I last had a health checkup. My doctor had put me on blood pressure medicine around 5 years ago when I was close to 200 lbs. Had tried changing stuff since then but nothing stuck long term.

I was used to eating no breakfast or maybe a croissant or bowl of oatmeal. Maybe lunch or maybe just a sandwich. But dinner was where it was at...ramen noodles with egg and cabbage, rice and lentils with chicken and frozen veggies in rice cooker, pizza, hamburger and fries, cheesecake, ice cream, salads, fiber crackers and cheese, sushi, curry and rice, fried chicken, Chinese... But if I ate at home the quantities would be 2 or sometimes 3 servings. And I'd drink beer or wine with it in the evening in front of the tv shows of movies.

I April I decided I couldn't keep on like that and decided to change. Cut down to drinking twice a week then one day a week, then quit completely. Started watching the quantities of the same food. And I started walking more. 

I finally got in to see a new doctor in May. Was shocked at my weight was 270..because I thought I had lost some since then. 

About a month later I had lost 20 lbs. Had bloodwork done. Elevated fasting glucose like 120.. and elevated liver enzymes. Cholesterol was a little high. But the doctor didn't seem that concerned. Said to take care of it all with diet and exercise. 

Saw a dietician to help me with food. Had tried to do it before over the years with a food scale, chronometer, and a jood journal, but I wanted the human support. 

Dietician gave me a meal plan

Breakfast:
20g oatmeal if hungry, if not 0
Yogurt 
Small piece of fruit

Lunch and dinner:
100g meat
2-3 spoonfulls of carbs or starchy vegetables
As many non starchy vegetables as I wanted
Snack: Skyr/yogurt, nuts

I stuck to this plan and grew to like it. Take reassurance in it, early g mostly baked chickens baked salmon with salad with oil and vinegar, and a couple hot vegetables steamed in the microwave. Sometimes I'd have egg or a small piece of meat and avocado for breakfast. 

I started walking more... Walking to the pool and swimming slowly. Gradually worked up to 45 mins of swimming e dry day.

Kept losing weight and stared having diziness that landed me in the ER twice. ER docs said it was anxiety. Saw the doctor off and on again and had bloodwork done a few times. In the DR after not eating breakfast andunch my glucose was around 70 in the evening. Asked them if I was diabetic or hypoglycemic and they said no. Bur they tolde to drink the apple juice and eat the applesauce they brought me with dinner.

A1C went down to 5.5 and fasting glucose to .95. I didn't think the nul9were great, but doctor was encouraging and reassured me. 

Doctor, like dietician, said to avoid rice, pasta, bread, added sugar. Limit the 'pleasure' meals or little treats to a couple times a month. Like.. having fries 2x a month max. Having an ice cream 2x a month.. and keeping the portions small. I didn't truck calories, just food weight. Bur once or twice I saw that the estimated calories were 1400-1500 a day.

I wasn't snacking every day. But Sometimes I'd have a small ice cream every week. I really limited the fries and fast food. And I started walking after meals, at least lunch and dinner. 

Lost 16 lbs in July. 16 lbs in August. And at this point I started to get scared and worried about the weight loss.

At one point I had pain in my abdomen. An ultrasound came back normal. Then it went away. 

I had a mild sensation iny chest off an on for weeks. Saw a cardiologist, who did EKG had a nuclear stress test and Sleep study. Cardiologist said I was turning things around. All normal except for the sleep study. They said I had severe sleep apnea and needed to use a CPAP machine for the rest of my life. Sleep doctor said he wasn't going to insist on weight loss.. since I had lost so much already. That really sent the anxiety through the roof. I couldn't sleep and had to force myself to eat and lost 6 lbs one week. 

The dizziness or balance came and went and came back. Sometimes I thought it was because of contacts.

I saw an endocrinologist who ordered bloodwork. Some things were high  normal or low normal one or two just out of range.. but be was reassuring and said it looked normal.

Saw the dietician again and I had lost more weight and muscle. 

In early September some evenings I felt weak and like my arms were too thin. Tried to add back in carbs. Went to get a small pizza and ate a slice (40-60g) with lunch or dinner over the week.  Before I ate an entire medium pizza in one setting. 

In late September after the sleep study and CPAP machine I stopped going to the pool and walking a lot because of anxiety and being scared about my weight. I had lost 12 lbs in September. 

I October I wanted to see if the weight could stabilize.  I started trying to add calories, a bit of cheese, a spoon of peanut butter, z yogurt with lunch and dinner, drinking a glass of milk, and having 120g of chicken or salmon. Lunch and dinner were around 400-500g. Sometimes I would feel hungry a few hours after eating. I tried adding more vegetables to be over 500g and wasn't hungry.

I was scared I had undiagnosed diabetes, hypoglycemia. Then it turned into being scared of liver disease or kidney disease and was wasting. I spent hours trying to understand the liver enzymes fromy bloodwork.

I was relieved to see that the weight loss has stopped. I'm just over 200 lbs in 5 months. 200 was the goal weight and I thought it would take a year or more. My original weight was 165 at low end, 180 at higher end.. but I'm scared to lose more until I know that everything is ok.

Endocrinologist ordered A1C and fasting glucose again last week and there are where they were in August : 5.5 and 95. A doctor looked at it and said I wasn't diabetic. But it's the first time he saw me. Endocrinologist seemed to think they are ok too.

I am nearsighted. I last had an Eye checkup in 2022. During the last few years my vision has gone down. I had a new checkup this year and prescription increased a little. I'm afraid that it was related to blood glucose. And I'm scared that it will keep happening. 

I'm thinking about getting a glucose tester or continuous blood glucose monitor to try to see what is going on and how I respond to food. 

Are these numbers (A1C 5.5 .or fbg) something to be concerned about? Will they continue going down? I don't want to go back to the way I was eating. I have had a lot of stress and anxiety about what I can eat now.
 
I'm trying to eat more normally, not weighing all the non starchy vegetables... Let myself eat fast food a little more often. Yesterday I went to Popeyes and got a chicken sandwich and fries. But I took my 100g salad and ate it while waiting. I took the chicken off the bun to eat it.. and only ate half the bottom bun, and about half the fries. I said I'll save them and try to eat a little at lunch and dinner over the next couple of days.

I don't drink coffee anymore because it was making my heart beat fast. I cut out tea also. I have tried herbal infusions. Lately I've been ordering hot milk if I go out. But sometimes I miss coffee. Yesterday tried half a stick of instant decaf in hot milk and it was good. 

I don't want to eat like I did before. But I'd like to be a le to enjoy small pleasures without worrying that I'm contributing to cardiovascular disease or losing my vision, stroke etc. And to be honest, the way mt life has been these last few months hasn't been very enjoyable. 

This last week the anxiety is better. I'm not shaking or trembling..and I don't feel hopeless, and a little less alone.",1,1761136677.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

Grind settings drop from 24-26 down to 10-11 ***during*** 25g grind

Bought my CS3 almost 6 months ago. It has been a very good grinder during that time. However, the last two days, it has not held its' initial grind setting throughout the grind process.

I mostly make French press in the mornings, and set for 24-26 clicks depending on beans. The last two days the grind size has shifted down to 10-11 clicks during the grind, which has adversely impacted my FP brew in a sign**ificant way.**

Could the spring be dead already?  
It seems to be very early for the spring to have compressed/weakened enough to cause this issue, but I have no way to measure its working tension, and I never measured its original height to compare to its current height.   
  
**Maintenance & Care**  
I fully disassemble and clean the grinder once a week to remove coffee oils and dust that cannot be removed with dry brushing each day. After cleaning and cloth drying, I dry it with hot air to remove all moisture and then reassemble.   
  
NOTES: 

1. I do NOT remove the outer burr during the deep cleans.

2. I do not store it with the settings tighter than 24-26 clicks between uses  
  
3. stored only as tight as it needs to be to reengage the settings nut to the shaft after deep cleaning

1od706i,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1od706i/late_trip_report_3_weeks_in_japan_first_timers/,(Late) trip report: 3 weeks in Japan (first timers & couple 28F & 28M),"Very long post incoming! Tried not to embellish too much and stick to the main points of our trip.

My partner (28M) and I (28F) were originally planning on going to Japan in 2020, but due to Covid-19 that trip was postponed to June-July of 2025. Since we were first timers, we decided to do the typical big 3 cities and sprinkle in some day trips or one-night stays. We didn't pack our days full of activities, as so to be able to experience everything to the fullest.

Even though it was supposed to be rainy season, we only experienced 3 days of rain.

Looking back I am very happy with our itinerary. Two things I would have done differently:

\- doing Osaka as a day trip (for 1 or 2 days) from Kyoto. We loved Kyoto and were not as big of fans of Osaka..  
\- Secondly, BIG MISTAKE: we brought duffel backpacks. Good for stuffing full, but A NIGHTMARE to carry from station to station in 30-35 degree heat, especially when you're changing hotels often. Definitely doing a rolling one next time!

**Day 1 (Sunday): Arrival at Narita**  
We landed in (and left from) Narita because it was cheaper than Haneda. We flew with Thai Airways which was perfect. We bought a physical Welcome Suica card at the station and each put 10.000 yen on it. First issue when we arrived: my luggage got lost (because of some delays in our layover in Bangkok). The staff in Narita was AMAZING: they wrote down all of our information. Everything was VERY organized and under control, I honestly never experienced something like it. In the end, my luggage was delivered to our hotel on Tuesday, two days after our arrival.

We stayed in an AirBnb by Cask Village in Itabashi for 7 nights. It was wonderful: beautiful and spacious room, close to two metro stations, about a 30min ride to any major attractions or districts, kitchen and washer included!

**Day 2 (Monday): Senso-ji temple, Asakusa, Sumida Aquarium and Tokyo Skytree**  
First thing in de morning was Senso-ji temple. Was kind of blown away by the amount of people. We roamed around Asakusa and then went to Tokyo Skytree. My partner wanted to wait until just before sunset to enter Tokyo Skytree, and because the aquarium was in the same building we decided to got. Honestly, SUCH a beautiful experience! It wasn't on our itinerary but I'd recommend it to anyone! Afterwards we went to Tokyo Skytree and saw mount Fuji!

**Day 3 (Tuesday): Meji Shrine, Inner Garden and Harajuku**  
Second day of 30 degree heat! Meji shrine felt so much more serene and calm than Sensoji, and we even witnessed a wedding! Afterwards we went to Harajuku and randomly booked a massage (at Arona Spa), because I'm prone to serious headaches and you know, why not! It was amazing being in this very calm space in the middle of such a big city. After that we explored Harajuku and Shibuya, tried out a Purikura photomachine. The small side streets of Shibuya are SO cozy to roam through!! It's like you're in a completely different city. One of my favorite memories of the trip. In the evening we tried out Kura (conveyor belt sushi). The food was okay, but it was cool to experience.

**Day 4 (Wednesday): Tokyo DisneySea**  
Fourth day was completely dedicated to Tokyo DisneySea. Arrived there at around 8h45 (about 15 minutes before the park opens) and we were in line for about 45 minutes before we entered the park. Luckily we brought an umbrella to protect ourselves from the blazing sun.

Tokyo DisneySea is beautiful! It didn't feel 100% like Disney to me, but we're not huge disney fanatics anyway, so we just enjoyed the beauty of the park. Lines were brutal, so we bought Premier Access about 4 times. It's not cheap, but so worth it. We probably saved around 4h by not having to stand in line. We paid around 7500 yen each (on top of entrance ticket) for PA.

Must do's: try all the churro flavors, they're so good + definitely try the gyoza! Soaring is a beautiful ride and Rapunzel is beautifully made - whether you're a big fan or not. The Toy Story ride was so much fun!

**Day 5 (Thursday): Tsukiji market & exploring Ginza**  
Tsukiji market was very busy, but it was cool to see all the fish vendors. After lunch we went to explore Ginza and Ginza six. If you're into books (any kind): the **Tsutuya Books** store inside Ginza Six is heaven. We went up to the top floor of the mall and you get a nice view of Tokyo from there. Tried to go to the Imperial Palace but was closed already. This is where we learnt that gardens and such close quite early in Japan (around 16h mostly).

**Day 6 (Friday): Ghibli Museum & Akihabara**  
By some stroke of luck we managed to get tickets for the Ghibli museum. If you're a Ghibli fan, obviously try to get tickets - it's amazing!!! The merch store was slightly disappointing though. Afterwards we explored the neighborhood and there's so many cute little cafes and stores!!

Afternoon was Akihabara and I love anime/figures/gaming so I loved it there! We stayed until the evening and it was very cool to see Akihabara by nighttime. Bought a couple of figures in Traders bc I honestly didn't know where the best deals were. I'm pretty sure I got an OK deal on both figures (they weren't anything major). Went to a Don Quijote for about 10 minutes and I never want to go inside one again. In my experience: everything you can get at a Don Quijote, you can get at any other pharmacy/souvenir shop/sweet shop.

**Day 7 (Saturday): Shinjuku, more Shibuya and teamLab Planets**  
Started with Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. Very peaceful! Next up was Shibuya crossing (didn't do it last time) and some second hand shops.

In the afternoon we take the train to Odaiba for our evening teamlab planets visit. This was my partner's idea and I thought it would be a tourist trap, but it felt so magical! The barefoot part was my favorite. I would definitely recommend it.

**Day 8 (Sunday): Gotokuji, Shimokitazawa and train to Hakone**  
One of my favorite days in Tokyo. Gotokuji was one of my favorite temples: not too busy, very cute and cute backstory/history as well. We went in the early morning so maybe that's why the crowds were okay. We went to Shimokitazawa afterwards. Very trendy-feeling neighborhood while cozy at the same time. Amazing if you like thrifting! Wish we could've spent more time there, but had to catch a train to Hakone.

We stayed in Hakone Kowakien Mikawaya Ryokan - our splurge of the trip. Had to book a room with private onsen, since I have quite a lot of tattoos on my arm. The staff was happy to provide a fabric sleeve if I wished to enter the public onsen. Gorgeous hotel, with a mini museum inside, spacious rooms, and a busstop close by.

**Day 9 (Monday): Hakone Ropeway**  
Did the standard ropeway and boat over the lake. It was very beautiful. Too cloudy to spot mount Fuji unfortunately. We hiked some more in Hakone and in the evening took the train to Kyoto, where we stayed in Crush On hotel. Only good things to say: close to everything - we could do most of our trips by foot. spacious room with tatami mats and paper sliding doors, and most of all: a really big bathroom!

**Day 10 (Tuesday): Kiyomizu dera & Kodai-ji**  
Can't speak enough on how much we loved Kyoto. Very different vibe from Tokyo. Aside from Gion that was very very busy, we could roam the streets and it was so calm and peaceful. Temple was gorgeous, even though it was packed. We ate lunch in Izuju Sushi and can't recommend them enough! We explored some more and went to Kodai-ji and it started pouring right as we entered (first rain of this trap we've had during the day). The grounds were almost deserted due to the rain and the rain made it even more special. Drank a green tea with a sweet in the tea house of the temple - never felt so peacful in my life - really recommend it.

**Day 11 (Wednesday): Nishiki market, Teramachi Street & Fushimi Inari-Taisha shrine**  
Ate breakfast in Kanno Coffee, really cute little coffee bar. Went to Nishiki to go knife hunting, and roamed around Teramachi and hit up some thrift shops. I was blown away by the sheer volume of thrift stores! Really enjoyed it. Went to a Pokemon Center as well.

An hour before sunset (at around 18h30 PM) we went to Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine, to try and avoid the crowds. None of the crowds you see on social media! We were able to snap lots of pictures with almost nobody in the background :) Saw the sunset over Kyoto at the first viewpont. We didn't go all the way up because it was getting quite dark. It's quite a special feeling to explore the shrine at nighttime.

**Day 12 (Thursday): Nishiki market part 2 and Imperial Palace**  
Went back for one of the knives my partner saw the day before. Bought beautiful woodblock prints in a cute little shop in Teramachi and drank coffee/matcha in a bar with an inner garden.  
Afterwards went to the Imperial Palace - so cool! The gardens are stunning.  
In the evening we go to Pontocho to explore all the restaurants but went out a little too late (at around 9PM), so a lot of restaurants weren't letting in any new customers for food.

**Day 13 (Friday): hike from Kurama to Kibune**  
One of our favorite parts of the trip! The hike uphill is a bit challenging, but very much worth it! The rest of the hike was very doable. When arriving at Kibune we saw that it was possible to eat on platforms on top of the river/little waterfalls, but unfortunately these had to be booked in advance, and could only be booked by hotel staff. Luckily, we found a little coffee bar that also offered spots on these platforms! 

At night we took the train to Osaka. Arrived at a station in an (apparently) very poor neighborhood. We saw people smoking, puking on the street and being generally very loud. This might have cast a bit of a shadow over our first and general impression of Osaka.

**Day 14 (Saturday): Dotonbori**  
Got tattooed (booked in advance) at Good Times Ink. Still one of my favorite activities. Afterwards we explored Dotonbori. Felt more crowded than Tokyo and we weren't the biggest fans honestly.

**Day 15 (Sunday): Osaka Castle**  
Osaka Castle is beautiful from the outside, but very modern inside. It's also not very big. The crowds were crazy. The history was very interesting, but too many people to be enjoyable.

Afternoon: half-day trip to Nara. This was a spur of the moment idea, since it wasn't on our itinerary, but we loved it! Definitely recommend it as a day trip out of Osaka. Lots of the deer snacks were sold out already because it was after midday.

**Day 16 (Monday): travel to Nagiso and hike to Magome**  
Also one of our favorite days of our trip! The trip from Osaka was horrible (mostly our own fault): lots of trains, wrong trains were booked, schedules were misread,...  
Had some drinks in the cutest little (and only) coffee/breakfast bar and took the bus to the starting point of the hike. It was absolutely beautiful, and not crowded with tourists at all. If you don't mind going out of your way, definitely visit Kiso Valley!!!

**Day 17 - 18 - 19: travel from Nagiso to Kamakura and 3 nights in Kamakura**  
We decided to unwind the last couple of days from our trip and hadn't really planned anything specific in Kamakura. We explored, ate food, did some shopping, got a custom ring engraved at Glanta to commemorate our trip, and sat by the beach (with my tattoos covered up). It was peaceful and wonderful. 

We visited the Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine - beautiful (we saw lots of animals: butterflies, birds,...), Enoshima, Kotoku-in.

**Day 20: travel back home to Belgium.**

It all started with a simple, kind of dumb problem: I save a ton of recipe videos on TikTok. I kept promising my partner we'd try all these new meals, but it never happened. My likes folder is a chaotic mix of videos, so the stuff I want to do ends up getting lost. I tried downloading the videos, but then they just got buried in my camera roll.

It felt like I was hoarding good intentions.

That's the core of why I started building my app - Stackd. It’s for people who actually want to do the things they save. I feel like my generation (gen z) is drowning in content. We see something cool, save it, and then instantly get distracted by the next thing. It's digital hoarding, and it stops us from getting out there and actually experiencing things.

I have built 2 iOS apps before, so I have some knowledge. As I started coding, I was building it purely to fix my own habit of saving stuff I never did. But somewhere in the process, I realized the idea was way bigger than just me. It could help anyone turn their saved ideas into actual experiences, like trip plans with friends, restaurant lists, or random TikTok finds that deserve to become memories instead of just being buried in folders.

The journey has been… a lot. There have been so many times mid-build where I've stopped and wished I had the finished app just for myself, so I could properly save my own finds.

**Here’s a quick look at the core features I've built:**

* **Smart Collections (Stacks):** Instead of one messy folder, you can organize everything into categories like ""Restaurants,"" ""Travel Ideas,"" or ""Recipes.""
* **Stacky (AI Assistant):** A little AI assistant that helps you decide what to do. You can ask it things like ""find me a coffee shop nearby"", ""what should I cook for dinner?"", ""I'm planning a trip to London, help me create an utility"", and it will pull info from your saved spots.
* **Interactive Maps:** See all your saved places pinned on a map so you can visualize your plans.
* **Memories:** A way to track which saved plans you've actually experienced, turning intentions into a timeline of your life.
* **Location-Aware Notifications:** The app can ping you if you happen to be near a spot you saved months ago and forgot about.
* **Friend Stacks (shared collections):** You can add friends and build shared stacks for trips, date ideas, or restaurant hunts.

I'm getting really close to launch, but I'm just one person, not a big team, and I've been working on this unpaid for months.

If this idea resonates with you at all, I'd be incredibly grateful if you joined the waiting list. I'm looking for people who can give honest feedback, help me hunt for bugs, and share feature ideas once it's live.

1od6ypv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1od6ypv/am_i_the_ah_for_making_my_relationship_with_my/,Am I the AH for making my relationship with my family fall apart?,"Sorry if there's any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

For context: I (30F) have been living in another country for almost 7 years. I moved to another country because of 2 of my aunts (let's call them Claire (the oldest) and Elsa (the youngest)) that convinced me to move here (they've been living in the country for a few years) so I could try to build a more stable life, then in my hometown. Well, their personalities while in our hometown and on vacation, are completely different than the ones they show where they live. I trusted and liked the vacation personality of them, so I trusted them and moved. For the first months, I lived with Claire, and after a few days, a rift started to build up between the three of us, because we started seeing that our personalities don't align, we don't have much in common, and slowly but surely, I started to feel alone (this is my perspective of the things, they have another perspective).  
When I moved to my own apartment, it's when I realized that they never called, never visited... The only time they came was to complain because of work... Note that I moved to a country where I needed to learn a new language, while at work (speaking English was not an option).

While I was working in the production system, I met a person, that later opened a restaurant and asked me if I wanted to work with him. Since gastronomy is part of my area of study, I left the production fabrics behind and we started working together. Between us, at some point, feeling started to grow, and we started dating, but because of how distant my relationship with my family is, I never officially presented him as being my boyfriend. So we kept a secret. Now I recognize, that he was very manipulative and obsessive, so much so that he wanted to control my phone all the time, he wanted to know where I go, with whom, why, and so on... I kinda had a blind eye for all of that, because at the beginning of the relationship everything is new, and everything can be excused. But slowly, slowly, boundaries started to be crossed. I was in a very bad shape, I was deeply depressed, he was pressuring me all the time (either I was too much, or not enough), and I had no one to turn to, so I turned to self-harm, in hope of relieving the psychological pain. 3 years go by, and I'm still in this manipulative relationship: experiences that I wanted to have for myself (like concerts) ruined because of him, and by him making the whole day about himself; gaslighting about anything and everything...

Last week, Elsa's boyfriend (let's call him Mark, and Mark and Elsa have been together for years now) asked me for a small favour. Well, I'm very aware that if I ever came here is because Mark got me the first job to begin with. And I'm very appreciated for that so of course I helped. While helping him with this favour (just driving him to the new job, because he would get the company car that day), we were talking and he felt that I wasn't in my best shape, specially psychologically speaking, so he offered to take a coffee so I could talk to him as in ranting. I see him like the closest of what I have as a father figure here, so I accepted. I told him about my secret relationship and begged him to not tell anyone because I was not sure if I could see a future in it, and he kept it a secret (important for later).

We had our coffee yesterday evening. Everything was going fine until my boyfriend started calling me non-stop. Tho, I rejected all the calls and even gave an excuse that I was talking with my parents and would call when I could, he kept harassing me. Mark saw how distressed it made and he, having a daughter the same age as me (from a previous marriage) obviously started getting worried, because he also sees me as a daughter. I told my boyfriend, please leave me alone, I have a lot to process and need some time for myself. Mark brings me home, and hold and behold my boyfriend is at my house, waiting for me outside. Mark was worried about me and tried to intervene, because of the way my boyfriend was starting to manipulate me. I tried to end the relationship then and there, I grabbed the few stuff he had at my house, gave it back and thought that would be the end of it. My boyfriend starts to create a drama, where all my neighbours could hear (and that was already at 11/12p.m.) . Mark, worried about my safety, offered to drive me to Elsa's place, so I could sleep there and not be harassed by my (now ex) boyfriend. Elsa wakes up to go to work at 5a.m., so going to her place, so late at night, I thought it would wake her up and scared the shitting hell out of her, and maybe would not be the better idea. So Mark, thought it would be better to go to his place instead, anything but my place to avoid the guy. While Mark was sleeping in the sofa, I couldn't sleep the whole night.

In the morning, when Mark tries to leave me home, my ex was still here, waiting for me to come back. Later on, we get to know that he (my ex) talked the whole night with Elsa (I don't even know how he got his number) and he even tried to message my mom via Facebook. I get today morning 2 voice messages from Elsa, blaming me for everything that happened yesterday, the now problem between she and Mark (because looks like Mark didn't told her that he would go take a coffee with me - but I still don't know how is that my fault), blaming me for him keeping secrets from her (when the only secret I asked was just the relationship), and she doesn't even let me explain to her anything. She just took what my ex-boyfriend told her as being the absolute truth, a total stranger to her, instead of her own boyfriend or niece.

So, am I the AH, in this scenario? How can I try to mend something so broken from the beginning?

P.S.: I also got a call from my parents to talk to me about the Facebook messages, that's how I learned about it, and because they didn't knew about the relationship, I had to rearrange a bit the story. But nonetheless, my parents are the ones trying to make me go to the infinity and beyond to make amends to someone who doesn't even let me speak to her.",0,1761136312.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

I bought a Mocca Master KGBV Select for the primary purpose of making single cups. I thought hot water = unequivocly better. Makes sense right? Plus its beautiful.

I already had a Zutto. I knew the temp was in a good range (average of 199F according to Serious Eats) but I wanted it to be HOT.

So after a few days of my Mocca Master I did a blind taste test between the Zoji and Mocca Master with identical water amounts and ground size (ode gen 2, at 4.1) First of all, I was very impressed with myself by identifying which cup is which. But I preferred the Zojirushi. It was a sweeter cup, more body, just overall more pleasant. America's Test Kitchen confirmed this and rated the $100 (CAD) zojirushi as better than the mocca master!

Anyways, I think the mocca master is going back. I am literally never making coffee for more than 2 people. It's a fantasy. In fact making coffee for 2 people in general is a fantasy as it seems like every girl I like doesn't like me back, or if they do something happens and it ends. Sometimes I see all my friends getting married and engaged and think ""is there something wrong with me? Are some people just not supposed to find love? Are some people just oddly shaped keys that don't fit in any locks?""

Anyways, shoutout Zojirushi, they make really nice stuff. I will be keeping it most likely (unless anyone here can really convince me of the mocca master for 1 person, which I doubt, cause everyone on their subreddit was like ""you're an idiot"".) and then just v60 when I want to be fancy.",1,1761136288.0,JamesHoffmann,4,0.6,False

A friend mentioned trying Crest, Hismile, or Gnaw Labs, but I have no clue which is actually safe for long-term use vs just good marketing.

1od6wlx,https://howdy.mvt.so/28-day-holiday-strength-challenge,5 Realistic Ways to Stay Consistent with Fitness During the Holidays (without skipping the fun),"The holidays are the hardest time to stay consistent — between travel, family gatherings, and allll the desserts, it’s easy to fall off track. I’ve learned the trick isn’t perfection… it’s keeping *momentum* with small, realistic wins.

Here are 5 ways to do that 👇

1. **Keep it short + sweet.** You don’t need 60 minutes. Even 15–25 minutes of focused movement keeps your body primed and your energy up.
2. **Anchor your workouts.** Choose a “non-negotiable” time (like right after your morning coffee or before your shower). Habits stick best when tied to something you already do daily.
3. **Prioritize strength and mobility.** Skip the random cardio guilt sessions. Quick kettlebell or bodyweight circuits that build strength (and reduce stiffness from travel) are your best bet.
4. **Plan for** ***some*** **flexibility.** If you miss a day, don’t throw the week out. Just move on and hit the next one. Progress over perfection.
5. **Join something structured and fun.** Having a plan — especially with festive workouts or community energy — makes it *so much easier* to show up.

That’s exactly why I created the [**28-Day Holiday Strength Challenge**](https://howdy.mvt.so/28-day-holiday-strength-challenge).  
It’s designed for busy women who want to stay active *without guilt or burnout* during the holidays — just 20–30 minute strength-based workouts you can do at home (or while traveling), plus accountability to keep you going.

If staying consistent through the holidays has always been your struggle, this could be your easiest win yet. 🎄💪

I know this might seem obvious, and I'm sure most people are already living with a pretty tight budget, but I know I, for one, will be not eating out at all, not even coffee, not shopping except for absolute essentials, and donating any extra money to food banks. I know there is a risk of this causing the government to simply add feeding people that use these benefits back onto the shoulders of the everyday American and food banks, but perhaps if the big corporations that they actually care about lose money on a big way (other than just the money from EBT) that will send a better message with the added benefit of saving us money. Good luck to you all, and I hope as few people as possible, especially those that did not vote for this, go hungry.

Edit: I realized this was a language issue, when I say shop I meant shopping for things like clothes and items, not grocery shop. I realize that most of us do not have the ability to shop somewhere other than where we already do, because our grocery budget is already stretched as thin as possible and we are already maximizing our money there.

The days here in the north are getting shorter—not to mention colder. I’m not ready for that. I hate it. It’s a harsh reality we have to face year after year, but I figured I’d give myself a little time to adjust to the idea. So... screw you, winter.

I’ve booked flights to Agadir and back, and I’ve got a roof over my head for a week (27th Oct–3rd Nov), but that’s basically it. I have a full-time job and I’m also working towards a master’s degree, so I’m not exactly short on things to do. Still, it could be a nice change of pace to occupy life with something different.

There are rumors of a nice beachfront in Agadir, where I fully intend to wear down the soles of my sneakers. I might even hit the gym on some days—gotta keep middle age at bay. From what I’ve gathered, there isn’t a whole lot happening in Agadir, so I’ve considered doing an overnight trip to Marrakesh if the grass is indeed greener there.

In conclusion, here are some things I might be interested in doing. If there are other adventurous spirits out there who’d like to join for any of these, hit me up:

Overnight trip to Marrakesh (round-trip by bus):
• Wander the streets & chill
• Attend a local football game (if there’s one happening)
• Stay the night in a riad
• Hot air balloon ride in the early morning?

Agadir:
• Grab a coffee, lunch, or go for a run together
• Visit the Sunday market
• Check out Croco Park
• Attend any local events

Feel free to suggest other ideas too, if none of the above appeal to you. I can offer company, stories from the north, and bad jokes—the last one is non-negotiable.

Wishing you a great week ahead. Stay awesome!

We live in the Netherlands, flew from Brussels to JFK and back from Newark to Brussels, both flights via London. I bought New York Passes before we left which allowed us to visit 5 hotspots. 80% of the spots where we ate I found searching Reddit and it did not dissapoint.

One tip I took from this subreddit was to make a custom Google Map. Put in all the things I wanted to see, where to eat and filed them under didderent categories / color tags. Took some time to prepare, but absolutely worth it. 

**Saturday 11 Oct** \- Landed around 4pm, immigration hall was completely full with people so I downloaded the Mobile Passport Control app using my pre-configured US e-sim, scanned passports, took selfies and then joined a different line with about 8 people in front of me. Immigration officer was a very nice guy and 10 minutes later we were walking towards the Air Train. I think the app saved us 1-1,5 hours right there. Took the train to Penn Station and checked in at the Doxie Hotel. It was already dark so we went to Times Square so we got that out off the way. Man it was busy. Went to the Brooklyn Diner and had a cheeseburger menu with a very nice milkshake. Back to the hotel and sleep. 11.529 steps

**Sunday 12 Oct** \- A lot of rain was predicted, so shops and a museum was the plan.But first, breakfast. Went to best bagel and coffee, there was no line so as Europeans we had no idea what to order and how quickly you're supposed to choose. So we let the guy behind the corner pick some bagels for us. He probably took advantage of that because I paid $65 for 3 bagels and 3 drinks. 😂 Bagels were excellent though and enough to skip lunch. Then we went to Macy's and went in when they just opened. The staff clapped and cheered when we came in and the girls loved that. Around 1pm it was still dry, so we decided to go to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum. Started to rain in the afternoon and made a stop at the hotel. Then went out to buy some umbrella's. More shopping and some book stores and it was time for diner. Took the subway for Pizza at John's of Bleecker Street. Waited outside for about 25 minutes to be seated, but the pizza was very good. After that, some more shopping, got the girls some ""not-so-standard"" NYC sweaters at Mure and Grand - West Village. Back to the hotel and sleep. 23,657 steps.

**Monday 13 Oct** \- More rain. So decided to go to the American Museum of Natural History. But first, breakfast at Andrews NYC Diner. Very good food (I had the pancakes), but way too much for my daughters. Took the subway to the AMNH. When we got out of the station there was a very long line stretching around the corner from the left side of the building so we just followed others and joined at the back. After around 30 minutes in line, we got to the entrance only to be told that the line we were in was for ticket holders. The New York Pass tickets we had, had to be converted so we were directed to the other line which went around the corner on the right side of the building! We had no idea about this system and we cut the line for the other queue because we felt we had paid our time in the line. Got some angry looks and comments. Museum was great though. After 3 hours the girls had enough. Took the subway again to visit the FAO Schwarz toy store. Since they were little, they always talked about the Build a Bear stores and we never got to visit one. Until now. Told them to both pick a bear and get them dressed. Great to see that even my eldest could finally see that wish come true. She's studying to be a doctor, so she got one with some scrubs.   Then we went to the FDNY store where my girls got me a t-shirts and the eldes one bought a FDNY rain coat for our dog at home. Talked with some guys there as I am a volunteer firefighter. Showed them our rig and they called it a u-haul. 🤣Had a great time there. Then it was time to eat. My youngest wanted to go to Raising Cane's because she saw it on TikTok. So we did. She loved it, but I didn't hink it was anything special. Back to hotel and sleep. 18,215 steps.

**Tuesday 14 oct** \- Rain was almost gone, but it was very overcast so a good day to visit the 9/11 memorial and museum. Got breakfast at RaminiEspresso and cafe which had really great coffee. Took the subway to Chambers street so we could walk towards the 9/11 site.  The museum was extremely impressive, especially the part where you're not allowed to take pictures. I watched a lot of 9/11 documentaries but I saw some things I'd never seen before. My youngest cried when see saw some children's drawings about their missing dad or moms. The museum definitely made an impression on us. After that we went to the FDNY Engine 7, Ladder 1, Battalion 1 house where the famous 9/11 documentary by the Baudet brothers was filmed. Was shown around by the Station Watch on duty and had a great chat. Then we got some quick lunch at a Starbucks and as the weather cleared up we then took the subway to Brooklyn. Got off at the first stop and walked to Brooklyn Heights and then strolled around DUMBO and got the ""iconic bridge spot"" photos. Saw the Brooklyn Ice Cream factory and mentioned to my daughters that previously they were in a small cute light house and when I turned around there it was. But now it hosted the ""Van Leeuwen"" ice cream company. Got some milkshakes there (which were truly excellent) before walking the Brooklyn bridge back towards Manhattan. We walked around the financial district a bit, saw the New York Stock Exchange and then went for early diner to Squire's Diner. Great burger, great staff. No tourist in sight. Got the subway uptown and went to Top of The Rock. Girls absolutely loved the city views at night.  Then back to the hotel and sleep. 30.131 steps.

**Wednesday 15 oct** \- Weather was very nice, got breakfast at Angelina Bakery (yummy). Took the subway, walk half of the Highline Park, went to some Taylor Swift spots like Cornelia street and a book store where she recored a video (my eldest is a swiftie). Hung around Washington Square Park for a bit  and then went to the Staten Island ferry. Took that both ways and got back on the subway and had a milkshake in Madison Square park before walking around the New York Public Library for a bit. We then went to the Empire State building and watched the sunset from the 102nd floor which was absolutely stunning. Very crowded though (to be expected). Then had dinner at Lazzara's Pizza Cafe, I had the weekly special with pepperoni and honey if I remember correctly and it was amazing. Back to the hotel to rest and sleep. 18,704 steps.

**Thursday 16 Oct** \- Weather was very sunny but quite cold in the morning. Went to Breads Bakery (close to central park) for breakfast, then strolled through Central Park. After that we got on the Roosevelt Air Tram and then walked a bit on the island with some great views along the waterside. Then it was time to go back to the hotel for the check out. Did some souvenir shopping, got one last shake, from Five Guys this time. Also very nice. Then went to Penn station and took the train to Newark Airport where we had a late lunch bite and 1,5 hours later we were in the air on our way back home. 6,259 steps.

We had a great time in the city and my girls want to go back already. :)",29,1761135537.0,visitingnyc,19,0.98,False

Context, me and my wife have twin 3 year olds. Both have their challenges, but my youngest is a delicate little soul, she gets upset at the tiniest of things and this recently came to a head with my FIL. 

They came around for dinner and whilst I was still working (I WFH, I heard all of this) my youngest burst into tears that she'd lost her favourite comforter, not angry, genuinely upset. She asked mum to help her find it upstairs and FIL made a comment that she had her wrapped around her little finger and was manipulating her (again, in front of her). Wife suggested FIL go with her to find the comforter however she screamed ""I don't want him, I want mummy"" to which his response was ""gosh you're a really naughty girl"", followed her upstairs teasing her that she doesn't have the comforter. 

We were stunned, our little girl now repeats that she's a naughty girl because he said so and she's mean. This was a kid that was genuinely in bits.

Now we've reached out to him, said it's not OK to speak to her like that and if he has opinions on her behaviour raise it to us directly and that she's still incredibly upset. His response is that it's his opinion. Not a 'I'm sorry', nothing. 

My wife already has a fractious relationship with him, he broke contact with her when she was 16 and we only initiated a relationship again because we felt it was fair that he knows he's a grandpa. She wants to completely cut ties. I've suggested last chance saloon at a mutual meet up at a coffee shop to discuss. But the main point here is our little girls and I will always do best for them, my other twin adores my FIL.

 I’m writing this now because sleep isn’t happening, and because the smell is back—the wax, that animal tallow stink I can’t wash off my hands no matter what I try. My name is Diego, I’m from Madrid, 32, project geotech for a small firm. Last weekend—Saturday night, October 11, 2025—I went out to the woods above a village in Lugo province with two friends, Mateo and Iván. We weren’t chasing anything supernatural. We wanted to finish a mapping job and make it fun with an overnight at a ruined hermitage that locals swear is safe if you keep quiet and don’t provoke the place. It was supposed to be easy overtime: cross-check coordinates, test a drone path over chestnut groves, sleep under a roof older than any of us.



 We’ve known each other since university—field labs, cheap beer, and colder mornings. Mateo films everything; he edits workplace videos into mini-docs nobody watches except our moms. Iván is the practical one, recently divorced, the kind of guy who checks the spare before he checks the map. I’m the one who says yes to too many things. The plan was simple: drive up, grab a caldo at the village bar, hike to the hermitage before twilight, shoot stars, test the drone grid for Monday’s survey, sleep, and go home before lunch on Sunday.



 The bar smelled like soup and wet wool. The old man at the counter—Emilio, he said, though everyone called him don—asked where we were sleeping. When we told him the hermitage name, he pressed his lips together, then laid a small ashtray on the table like it was a talisman. He said certain nights the woods are crowded in ways you don’t see. Don’t answer if someone calls you by name, he told us. If you feel a gift pressed into your hand, drop it. If the wind goes still and you smell wax, step inside a circle of ash and wait without speaking. We smiled and promised we’d be careful. He didn’t smile back.



 We left the bar into a drizzle that turned to a fine mist by the time we reached the trailhead. Galicia does damp like a second atmosphere. The path threaded between chestnut and oak, the kind of green that eats sound. The hermitage sat on a shoulder of rock above the village; we could see its slate roof when the trees opened. Mateo was talking about timelapses of moving cloud; Iván showed me a photo of his little boy with a plastic dinosaur, the first thing to make him smile all week. Everything felt normal. Better than normal, honestly. Work had been loud and here it was very quiet.



 The hermitage was exactly as Google had promised: four walls, one door hanging wrong on rusty hinges, and an altar made of the same stone as the hill. We set the stove on a flat rock, ate bread and cheese and the last of the caldo in plastic. Mateo whistled softly as he fitted the tripod plates; Iván stretched his bad knee and grunted. I felt that city static peel off me. After sunset the clouds burned away and the sky went fierce, stars speaking like they only do far from streetlights. We were three men and the cold, and it was good.



 On our second pass to fetch water from a rivulet below the clearing, we cut a corner and found a fork I didn’t remember from the map. In the center someone had traced a ring of ash. It wasn’t a campfire ring—too clean, too careful—and there were drips of wax on a stone the way kids make when they tilt a candle over paper. A small cross of twigs lay half-buried, soggy. I kicked it gently and it slid with a rasp. Iván said some village kids must’ve played at Holy Week. Mateo squatted to film and then stood quickly, shaking his head like a horse does when a fly touches its eye.



 We put the drone up to check canopy gaps, but it came home early with a full battery like it had hit a ceiling we couldn’t see. Mateo swore softly, tapped the controller, sent it again. Same thing. While he fiddled, Iván and I noticed a leaning cross—two sticks tied with string—propped across the path we’d just taken in. It hadn’t been there ten minutes earlier. I set it aside without thinking. The air felt heavier, like a shop before closing where the clerks are waiting for you to leave.



 We got proper night around eleven-thirty. The headlamps went red to save our night vision; the stove ticked. When I checked my phone for the time later, the lock screen said 01:07 with the seconds frozen—no signal, just the hour like a painted sign. I locked it, opened again. 01:07. It was funny until it wasn’t. Somewhere to our right, down the slope, a man’s voice said my name. Not loud—more like a greeting from a neighbor turning the corner. Diego. The way my mother says it when I answer the phone distracted. I turned halfway and caught Iván’s sleeve. Don’t answer, he said, and I realized he was kneading his jaw like it hurt.



 We killed our headlamps and crouched behind a low stone. The lights we thought were farmhouses moving through the trees were not farmhouses. They were hand-held, a wavering little chain of gold sliding along the slope. I smelled the sea for a moment, impossible so far inland, brine cutting through leaf rot. Mateo raised the camera but didn’t press record. Between trunks I saw shoulders hunched under hoods, faces like washed-out photographs, and at the front a taller figure carrying a cross that looked heavier than any one of us would want to lift. The candle flames burned steady even when the mist licked at them. Somewhere behind us the voice said my name again, softer. Diego.



 We held as the column passed below, but the front figure turned uphill, smudged by branches, and without hurry came toward us until I could have touched the cross. A second hand lifted, offering it, patient. I’d like to pretend I remembered Don Emilio’s warning quickly, that I dropped my own hand instantly, but the truth is I reached and only stopped because the wood felt cold in a way wood isn’t supposed to. My palm came away wet, slicked with a wax that wasn’t quite wax. The world tilted an inch. Mateo hissed my name through his teeth like he could pull me backward with it.



 We ran without dignity. The procession didn’t chase. It didn’t need to. Tracks we knew a couple of hours earlier refused to be where we left them. The nearest structure was a hórreo, a granary on stone legs ten meters off the path, and we piled into it and dragged the warped door nearly shut. The slats let in threads of light and the smell of old grain and mouse. Outside, candle-glow passed like a tethered river. My palm burned cold where the not-wax had smeared; when I wiped it on my pants it left a dull sheen like oil.



 The latch rattled lightly with no wind to move it. Then something small and pale pressed under the door: not a finger but the idea of one, a bulge of wax finding space the way water does. I stamped and it flattened, smearing, then gathered itself again—slow, patient—until Iván ground his boot hard enough to drive it back. He whispered a prayer I didn’t know he knew, not showy, just words from somewhere older than us. Mateo said please twice, to the room or to the air. Someone outside moved past, a sound like cloth brushing bark, measured as a tolling bell.



 I tore open the ashes tin from the stove, hands shaking so badly I almost dumped it into the gaps in the planks, and traced a ring around us on the splintered boards. It felt ridiculous until it didn’t. When the circle closed the light from outside thinned, like fogged glass between us and them. The latch lifted and dropped once, twice, nine times—counting the knocks made my throat hurt. None of us spoke. The smell of tallow was so strong I could taste it, fat and old. Through the slats I could see sandals but no feet in them, just the leather, and then nothing at all, like a page turned.



 Dawn came like someone lifting a wet cloth. When we finally opened the door the air moved again and the birds made the usual cheap jokes. On the threshold hung a new stick cross from the latch we hadn’t fastened, twine still wet. In the mud below the steps were footprints—naked, human-looking, all heading away downhill toward the stream, no pattern of return. On the granary floor the ash circle was scuffed but unbroken. I picked up a loose ribbon I thought was trash and saw my initials stitched in tarnished thread. D G. I don’t own anything with embroidery.



 We didn’t talk about it as we packed, because talking would mean deciding whether it had happened. The hermitage looked like a postcard you could buy in any petrol station: pious ruin, forgettable. I scrubbed my left palm with sand and water until it went raw, but the sheen remained and the smell stayed, like I’d been helping butcher something. On the way down none of us wanted to be first; none of us wanted to be last. We returned the drone to its case like we were apologizing to it.



 Back in Madrid I told myself we’d been overwrought in a place geared for ghost stories. I kept telling myself while I scoured with dish soap, with coffee grounds, with rubbing alcohol until my skin protested and the smell lingered anyway. I slept a few hours Monday and woke at 1:07 a.m. exactly with the sound of slow steps in the hall outside my apartment, steps that stopped at my door and then continued past like a neighbor pacing with a baby. Tuesday, the same. Wednesday, I dreamed I was carrying something heavy down rows of trees and the weight wasn’t a burden but a task I’d been given long ago, something I’d forgotten and was glad to remember.



 Thursday I opened Mateo’s shared folder to sort survey clips. Most files were perfect: shaky jokes, skyline, Iván complaining about his knees. One clip I didn’t recognize started black, then showed the three of us crossing the clearing in a jittering gold light. The camera was low, like set on the ground. We passed in front of it and I froze. I was barefoot. I don’t remember losing my boots. A black strap crossed my chest and something long and dark rose over my shoulder. The timeline said 00:03 on October 12. Behind me, Mateo and Iván kept a respectful distance with their heads dipped like mourners. I closed the laptop so fast the mug jumped.



 That night Don Emilio called. He shouldn’t have had my number, but he said Iván gave it to him to ask if we’d found a rosary. No, I said, we hadn’t borrowed anything. He hummed in a toothless way and told me not to answer if someone came to return what I’d already taken, and to check my bags for anything that wasn’t mine. After we hung up, I opened my pack and found, beneath the drone charger, a strap of cracked black leather that smelled like smoke and old churches. It fit my chest without adjusting. I put it on the table and went to wash my hands again. When I came back, the strap lay in a neat circle, like it wanted to be a ring around something.



 Earlier today I ducked into the chino shop on the corner for batteries. I passed the shelf of candles and one stub, the cheapest sort, sputtered and took flame. There was no lighter near it, no matches. The clerk didn’t look up. I stood there like an idiot watching the wax run in a line down the side, a perfect thread that reminded me of that thing pushing under the hórreo door. When I got home, the hallway smelled faintly of salt air though I live 600 kilometers from the sea. Something had been pressed into my mailbox slot, and I half-expected a candle to fall. It was empty.



 If you grew up in Galicia you probably have a name for what we stumbled across. I didn’t grow up there, but my grandmother did, and some of her stories wore the same shoes: a procession that moves like an errand, the living conscripted to lead the dead, the weight in your hands a cross you shouldn’t accept. I thought those were for scaring kids into coming home before dark. Tonight, before writing this, I made a small ash circle on a plate because it feels less ridiculous to be ridiculous on purpose than to pretend none of this is happening. The strap they offered me—because I think that’s what it was, an offer—sits coiled like a sleeping snake. I keep smelling wax when the wind is perfectly clean.



 I keep thinking about the video frame and how calm I look carrying that weight. I keep thinking about how the flames didn’t flicker and how the air didn’t move until we drew the circle, and how a ribbon with my initials lay where I’d stand to leave. If this is a prank, it’s a mean one that knows too much. If it isn’t, then there’s a schedule I’m not making but that keeps me anyway at 1:07, the minute my phone learned to be only a sign. It’s late again, and the steps are back in the hall—pace, pause, pace, a knock lower than knuckles, something like wood on wood. I’m going to post this and then sit inside my little ash ring like a child because I don’t know what else to do.
