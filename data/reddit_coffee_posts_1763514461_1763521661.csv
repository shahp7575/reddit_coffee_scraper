I just started a small YouTube channel called [Seasons of Cozy](https://www.youtube.com/@SeasonsofCozyy), and I’m super excited (and honestly a little nervous). It’s all about creating relaxing ambience videos such as snowfall, fireplaces, smooth jazz, cozy coffee shops, and calm seasonal vibes.

My goal is to build a peaceful corner of the internet for people who like studying, relaxing, sleeping, or just having something comforting in the background.

Since the channel is *brand new*, I’m hoping to learn from people who’ve grown channels before:

* What helped you gain *your* first 100–500 subscribers?
* Is there anything you wish you had done earlier?
* Are thumbnails, titles, tags, or upload frequency the most important early on?
* Any mistakes I should avoid while starting out?

I’d also genuinely appreciate any feedback on my first videos (quality, ambience, audio, pacing, etc.). I’m open to improving whatever needs work as I am just trying to learn and grow.

Thanks so much to anyone willing to share advice. ❤️  
And if cozy ambience is your thing, feel free to stop by and say hi! > [Seasons of Cozy](https://www.youtube.com/@SeasonsofCozyy) ",1,1763521156.0,SmallYoutubers,0,1.0,False

1p0w5fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/solofemaletravellers/comments/1p0w5fm/solo_female_travel_to_oahu_experience_itinerary/,Solo Female Travel to Oahu Experience & Itinerary,"I love reading these when I’m planning my travels, so here was my experience. I stayed 4 days 3 nights and stayed at Seaside Women’s Hostel in Waikiki! 

Hostel experience: 
Pros: cheap & great stay! I stayed in a 6bed dorm and there were only 2 other women there, so it was fairly private! We were given a set of sheets & pillow case and towel. Everyone working there was so kind. Felt extremely safe as you need a fob to get in the gate to begin with. Great area. Met cool people. Free coffee & brownies in the morning and cold filtered water. Cutie common areas. Clean bathrooms & rooms since no shoes were allowed inside (I still wore shower shoes around, not outside!) Comfy beds as far as hostel bunk beds go!

Cons: None of these things would deter me from staying again, just things that I would change if I could! This hostel has no curtains around the bed, so I used my towels to put up around me when sleeping, it was fine for me. No AC, cooled down fine at night & I used my plane blanket, but man it was hot during the day. The shower area got very stuffy and the shower never actually got hot, just luke warm, which was actually for the best bc I was a sweaty mess in the steamy bathroom & had to stand in front of the fans in the bedrooms to cool off haha. Lastly, not the hostel’s fault but the others in my room never locked the doors. One time I came in and the back door was WIDE open and no one was around… idk what that was about but luckily it was an extremely safe space and I never locked any of my things up, since all of us minded our own business :)

Itinerary: 
Day 1: arrived into Honolulu and took an uber to the hostel, it was about $33 and I landed at 3PM. Checked in to the hostel, changed and got my bed situated. Walked to the beach to catch the sunset 5-5:30ish and then ate at Maui Brewing Company (it was fine but expensive I wish I would’ve gone anywhere else lol) went back to the hostel around 7pm bc I was beat and slept for like 9 hours straight lol

Day 2: woke up at 7:00 am, had a cup of free coffee @ hostel and then started my walk to diamond head! You need a reservation, so I booked from 8-9. Diamond head is about a 45 minute walk (I’m a walker! 2.5 miles) the walk uphill was nearly as tough as the hike itself! I didn’t find it too challenging to get up, I’d consider myself a fairly average in shape person, but I do not work out! There were a lot of people & great views. After the hike I walked back to Waikiki and had coffee & avocado toast at Sunrise Shack by the Honolulu Zoo, again it was fine but I did find it overpriced. The rest of the day I wandered until about 2PM when I was off to a wedding, the reason I was there, for the rest of the day. 

Day 3: rented a car from enterprise on seaside avenue. It was about $75 for the full day. I had breakfast & coffee and Aloha Cafe over by diamond head and loved it!! Then I drove from the eastern side of the island basically around the whole island. Stopping when I found a beautiful overlook, wanted to take a walk, or sit at the beach. Had lunch in Kailua and looked at some shops, stopped at food trucks on the north shore, and basically did whatever I wanted! I was out for about 7 hours and drove around the entire island! Watched the sunset at Waikiki then ate dinner at Stix food court and it was 10/10. Then had an acaii bowl from ALOH which you get a discount at if you stay at the hostel :) such good bowls!!

Day 4: my last day, my flight wasn’t until 8PM so I got checked out & was able to leave my bags at the hostel! Another great perk! I bought some souvenirs from Duke’s marketplace & the international market place at coconene’s! Then spent the day at Kahanamoku Beach, had acaii & steak lunch from the shops by the beach! Then had time to go back, shower at the hostel (amazing of them) and uber to the airport! 

It was a great experience overall and I can’t wait to go back to explore more!

Basically, she followed me on Instagram and I didn’t think much of it at first. She then started replying to my story posts and asked if I would be down teach her how I do my finances. At work the next day she approaches me in the hall and says we should set up a coffee date after work. She is recently divorced and I didn’t really view this as a “date”, but we were messaging later and I said why don’t we just get food since I didn’t want coffee at 6 pm lol. 

The next day we go get food and we chatted for almost 2 hours but never talked about finances, mainly telling stories and just chatting, and after food she asked if we could go to the dessert place next door since the waiters were looking at us and it was busy. We go there and chatted another 45 minutes or so and probably talked about money stuff for like 10 minutes.

After we said our goodbyes I was sort of confused because it seemed more like a date but also just figured it could be her personality. I end up asking her on a real date and she basically said she wasn’t ready for something romantic yet but still wanted to hang out and get to know me. I figured she probably just wasn’t interested or was still dealing with the divorce so I was just like ok no problem. She invited me that weekend to go out for some lunch with a couple of our coworkers and I was like sure why not.

This is where I really started getting confused… at lunch she started taking fries off my plate and offered me a bite of her food off her fork. This type of stuff doesn’t bother me but I don’t think any of my platonic women friends would do that. We went for ice cream after lunch and after she got hers she was like “here try it” and fed me hers off of her spoon, and then got a coffee and had me try that too. 

Basically I am trying to figure out if she is interested and wants to get to know me first or if I’m just being delusional and she just has looser boundaries on sharing food and such. She still messages me at work every day and we text sometimes, but I haven’t asked her to hang out this coming weekend or anything like that. I was planning on not initiating any hang outs or anything until she did and just kind of keeping a safe/not desperate distance. What do you guys think is my best course of action if I want to try to date her? Obviously I understand the recent divorce thing is a challenge but it’s a huge deal to me.

1p0w0dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1p0w0dz/conflict_avoided_too_hard_and_now_im_resentful/,Conflict avoided too hard and now I'm resentful,"First of all, long post, sorry lol. Second, elephant in the room, this is my fault. IATA. I know it's my fault. I feel bad for what I've done. I haven't been and am not being fair to this person. This is my responsibility to fix and I'm not ignoring that. Regardless, I do feel genuinely angry with this person and I have become paralyzed by my own emotions so I'm hoping for some advice.

So here's the background (I swear this is all relevant lol): I am in my third year of college, my friend Y their second, we have been friends since sophomore/freshman year of highschool. Y is diagnosed ADHD and on medication. We are both STEM majors (high workload), I'm really struggling in my degree but need good grades for grad school, so I spend a lot of time studying. Their prospective careers value experience over grades, so they don’t study as much and do lots of internships instead. They want to move out soon, I am staying at home till I finish college, but not just for academic/financial reasons. My parents fight often and it makes my home life fairly unstable. I am my family's emotional 'rock', especially so to my younger sister (16) who does NOT handle the stress well. Soon as the fighting starts it's either 'this is all my fault, I'm gonna unalive myself' or 'this is all their fault, I'm gonna unalive myself'. With my parents being preoccupied with each other and her reacting so violently, I feel there NEEDS to be a third adult at home: enter me. Before anyone suggests it, no, the situation is not severe enough for social services (I've tried. Don't tell them lol). It's not so much the situation that's out of control but their reactions, if they could all get into the habit of taking a fucking breath before going scorched earth, things would be better. And to their credit, they are. Explosive fights are still a threat at my house but they're becoming less frequent. My sister is starting to mature and handle things better. She'll be 18 by the time I finish my degree and I think she'll be independent enough that she won’t need me 24/7. It's not just that I don't reasonably feel like I can leave, I also genuinely think the situation will be better in \~2 years. And in the meantime, free housing and food! When I can use it lol.

I knew this year was going to be particularly rough in my family for a multitude of reasons, so for the first time ever, I confided in another person: Y. I wasn’t so much asking for support as just filling them in on what had been going on + what was going to happen. I mainly just felt like I was going to explode and go mental if I didn’t tell someone. Since then, they have offered support in a variety of ways and I have taken some help. In preparation for the school year, I studied with them nearly every day; they were taking summer classes I was planning on taking so we were working on that together a lot. I was initially planning on preparing alone, but might as well get coffee with them while I do, right? Mainly, I just tell them about whatever bullshit is going on at my house- when I can that is.

Y isn’t perfect, no one is. As a fellow neurodivergent person, I feel bad saying this bc I know it’s not their fault to an extent. That being said: their ADHD makes them hard to be around at times. For instance, I can never get through conversations without being talked over/cut off. I usually just give up talking to them by the second or third interruption, and this has been the dynamic for so long that they don’t even notice when I shut down around them. They also have sensory issues that affect where we can hang out/what activities we can do/what we can eat. Their sensory issues are nearly opposite of mine ironically enough, but mine are less severe, so I’ve just been accommodating them at my expense for years; it’s easier than it would be the other way around. They constantly talk or text me. I get around 8 text messages a day, not counting at least 3 instragram reels. I used to be able to handle it but with school + family drama, I haven’t been able to keep up with it for months. I’ve just been saying that I ‘forget’ to respond bc 1. I genuinely do sometimes, and 2. I can’t exactly ask them to text me less. Along this train of thought, they also want to hang out all the time and take me saying no as me not caring about them.

The last thing is the biggest though; Y claim’s it’s an ‘ADHD thing’ and they can’t control it and at this point, idc if that’s true or not, I’m ready to end the friendship over it. They all but refuse to take ‘No’ as an answer to things. This red flag popped up early in the relationship, and I ignored and therefore enabled it. That was my mistake. These are the examples that come to mind first: When I say I don’t want to eat/hang out somewhere, they claim they are making the request over sensory issues and I’m insinuate I’m being selfish for not wanting to accommodate every time. Same thing with driving- they NEED to carpool with me, in their car, with them driving, Sometimes, when I say ‘no, I’ll drive myself’, they show up at my house with their car 10 minutes before, and if I say ‘no’ again they make a big fuss about how they’ve already drove here and I’m being irrational. There have been numerous times over the years where I have ended up being trapped in a situation/place I didn’t want to be for hours after driving with them, but when I say anything they counter with ‘I get too anxious driving somewhere alone’. The next two examples are what makes my blood boil though, and there’s not a doubt in my mind that it’s justified. There have been times where I’ve told them very explicitly I need space and to not hear from/see them. Both times I have given them reasons and a date to expect to hear back from me and the second time, said I needed space from ‘everyone’ to soften the blow. These were times of crisis, I had seriously hit my social/stress limit and NEEDED breathing room. The first time, they agreed and told me ‘no problem!’, and then proceeded to text me 37 times over the 3 day period I asked for, and be passive aggressive when I came back over me not responding. I had even texted them to remind them that I ‘couldn’t respond to texts rn, I’ll respond the 30^(th)’. The next time, 28 text messages and they Showed.  Up.  At.  My.  Job.   To “Hang Out”.

I was livid. I still am. The problem has gotten worse too, they are no longer just insistent, they’re controlling. For instance, they know I have a gap on Wednesdays between classes, and on the first week of school I (naturally) did not have plans to spend it. \*Without telling me\*, they decided we had a study group together then. When I wasn’t in the library like they expected me to be next week (NEXT WEEK. This ‘study group’ I didn’t know I was obligated to had happened ONCE at this point in time), they flipped out on me, accused me of not caring about them, said they had a panic attack, etc. Despite all this, they did not tell me they expected me to be available Wednesdays until a month into school. By then, I had scheduled a study group with M, one of my classmates, who is rarely on campus and able to study. Y immediately started inviting themself to this study group. Because of my family’s bs, it’s hard for me to keep friends and I don’t have many outside of Y. M is the basically the only person I see outside of classes, we study together for 4 hrs max once a week. She’s super nice and I’d like to hang out with her more but her schedule and my workload don’t accommodate it.

So, I’ve been rambling a bit, here’s where we are now and what drove me to post. Last week, Y texted me, asking if we could ‘get coffee’ on Wednesday, “preferably without M”. I was immediately pissed. M is literally the only person I see outside of Y, she’s only available Wednesdays, and usually only for a few hours. I took “preferably without M” as “you’re spending too much time with your new friend and not enough with me”, and then reminded myself that I was mind-reading and needed to stop. I texted back “that’s the only time M is available, how about Monday?” Monday has a smaller gap in my schedule, which Y pointed out. I said “I have an hour between classes, we can meet at a coffee shop for \~30 to 45 minutes”. Y said “no, I want to meet on campus, have me drive us somewhere off campus, and hang out for a few hours”. By this point, I had basically explained why that wasn’t a reasonable request and was FUMING so I just didn’t respond, I had nothing left to say and was too angry to be diplomatic. A day later they responded with “fine, we’ll just meet at school” “I have stuff to talk to you about. Important stuff. Well, important to me, hopefully it’s important to you too but idk”.

Every time they say ‘we need to talk’ they say ‘you don’t spend enough time with me and I don’t feel like you care about me’ (side note, we currently see each other 3-4 times a week and I spend 4+ hrs of my Saturday with them). I say back ‘I’m sorry, but I’m busy at school and sometimes have to cancel for ‘family emergencies’. I’m already at my limit for how often I can hang out/study’. Their response is always “I’m emotionally dependent on you, you need to spend time with me regularly for my sanity.”. They become increasingly passive aggressive and unpleasant to be around after these conversations and continue to make requests they know I can’t fulfill and when I say no, it’s all “you don’t care about me”, “you’re being selfish”, “I rely on you for emotional stability”. All these (except the selfish one) are verbatim quotes.

So yeah, when I got that last text, I was livid. No way I was about to be chewed out for not cancelling my only other social contact of the week on a whim to get coffee before a midterm. I said I wouldn’t be on campus and we can call instead, and they immediately went ‘nvm’ (to the conversation) and asked why I wouldn’t be on campus. I know from experience that they don’t take answers like “I’m just not available” so instead I replied with “I am too angry for an in-person conversation”.

This is the first time I have ever told them I’m angry at them. “I don’t like \_\_\_”, sure, I’ve done that, but never explicitly “I am angry at you”. Yes, some of this behavior is objectively shitty but still, this is definitely coming out of left field for them. I definitely should have said something sooner, but I didn’t and now we’re here. I am so mad at them all the time. I dread checking my phone because I hate seeing texts from them, ‘good’ or bad. I skip classes because I know they’ll show up outside my classes before they start/end to ambush me when I’m not receptive enough. I feel on high alert on campus because of them and at home because of my family, and I’m cracking. I’m honestly ready for the friendship to be over but I don’t think its an option bc they know where I live, have a house key, know where I work, know my school schedule, and have demonstrated they have no problem showing up uninvited. I keep giving them excuses as to why I haven’t shared my schedule for next semester and the other day, they started looking up what classes they know I need to take in the student portal to find meeting locations. When I told them to quit it, they got mad at me for asking.

When I ask for space, they show up. When I say I can’t text, they text me relentlessly and fault me for not responding. I genuinely don’t feel like I can walk away. I feel like I could tell them tomorrow “I hate you and never want to see you again” (I don’t, I’m just trying to drive a point home) and they would still show up uninvited to try and schedule ‘coffee dates, to talk’. I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like no matter what I’ll do, they’ll respond badly and make my life a living hell over it, but after that last text it’s too late to stop any of it. I don’t know how to start this conversation or how to handle the fallout and I just want to ghost them so fucking badly, but despite it all, they don’t deserve that. Sorry for the long post, I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1,1763520561.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

**Move-in is flexible** anytime between **Jan 15 – Mar 1** (Feb 1 ideal).

My max budget is **around $3,200 for my share** and I’m hoping we can find something that feels like a true home, not a glorified dorm.

# Neighborhoods I’m targeting

* Off the **4/5** or **2/3** lines
* **Brooklyn Heights**
* **Fort Greene** (near Nevins or Atlantic)
* **Boerum Hill / Park Slope** (near Atlantic–Barclays)
* **Prospect Heights / Crown Heights** (around Franklin Ave)

# About Me

* 30-year-old
* Licensed psychologist — WFH 2 days/week doing telehealth quietly from my bedroom
* Friendly but independent; happy to cook together, hang out, or introduce you to my friends, but also totally okay doing our own thing
* Out several nights a week, so you’ll get plenty of quiet/alone time
* Clean, organized, and very respectful of shared spaces
* Have some furniture but flexible if you already have pieces you love
* **Has a cat**. He is very sweet, short-haired, fully litterbox trained, and non-destructive (has literally never scratched or bitten anyone). Mostly naps/hides but will cuddle you if you give him a treat. I’m very thorough about cleaning so there won’t be hair or odors.

# What I’m Looking For

* Someone who pays rent on time
* Clean and respectful of shared spaces
* Likes cats
* Open to signing a **12–18 month lease**
* Ideally would enjoy some chill hangs (and maybe watching *Severance* together when season 3 finally drops)
* Open to living with 1–2 roommates (I’m flexible if we find a great group)
* **Dealbreaker:** No cigarette smoking inside. But drinking or social substance use is fine

# Apartment Preferences

* Decent-quality building (not a party/dorm vibe)

1p0vzk7,https://i.redd.it/sf9hr4nun42g1.jpeg,Green line for a buy. But I’ll probably miss it as I’ll be asleep in a few. Long day today I’m just so tired. Haven’t really had time to recover from moving and then helping My friend restaurant move 😭busted up. Might take next week off to be honest. I’ll share my ideas still though. I’m exhausted.,"I’ll try to focus on the code it’s pretty much down and very excessive but you can hide all on chart objects and show adjust whatever you like. I should have those in a few. Maybe Christmas as I want to properly test my strategy and have a course to go with it live using strictly my indicators I’ve built from my own strategy and 9 years in the market.

Trading isn’t easy by any means but with the right tools and mentor and the ability to be realistic and honest with yourself, you’ll find success.

You have to have an enough mentality. Do you keep trading until the account is gone or what is enough risk what is enough profit.

Do you really need to trade every day?

When is enough losing enough. And what spread is too much and things like that. I’d say risk about 5% your account balance per trade. If you’re scaling I’d say break that into to 10 trades at 0.50% each so risk is still maximum 5% I do 10% and sometimes if I’m retarded and greedy I do 20% never 50% never 100%. 

20% is bad trading but I’m quite confident in my ability and my actual strategy.

So in reality I could afford to blow every single account I have and I’d find a way back but slowly.

So if that’s the case why rush into trades and try to make a $1MM a day even though I could brag about it, I’d rather brag that I helped at least one persons family financially free with the information I’ve learned or the courses I created and the tools I created and all for free.

Why charge because I consider myself an expert😂😂😂😂 nah I don’t but. I have an urge to help. 

I’ll probably be smoking 300 turkeys Thanksgiving week and feeding the homeless.

Why? Why the fuck not. If you can give give and help those in need. 

Giving is easy pay for someone’s coffee and start small or help an older lady reach the top shelf.

Just give and give with an open heart and God will bless you.

I’ve been shit 3 times and stabbed 8 times. I shouldn’t even be here. And now I’m here giving my entire life’s work away for free. 

The odds. I’ll get everything done and most likely sell them off my website but obviously I’ll just do that because I’m curious what others think they are worth but everyone here gets everything for free always.

But I might sell some of the tools I made and help fund Christmas dinners and coats and jackets and sleeping bags and things if that’s nature.

I want to eventually build an apartment building for the homeless that also keeps families together and safe.

I’m quite grateful for all of yall.

Even my scalping has significantly improved. A lot less draw down and a lot more confident.

Thank you guys for everything. Hopefully I’m worth your time.",1,1763520495.0,ForexNoobTube,0,1.0,False

Does anyone know what I may have?
I woke up yesterday morning perfectly fine, nothing different in my routine. I had my breakfast and then enjoyed my coffee and out of nowhere I get this dizzy feeling which I have never experienced (i haven’t even felt dizzy before). It was not a spinning sensation it was an off balance feeling where my head felt like it couldn’t stay still like it was moving from side to side or a rocking sort of feeling. At the same exact moment I got this crazy sudden rush of nausea and I am used to feeling nausea as I have a fear of throwing up but anyone with this fear knows when they are actually going to and bam I did throw up!! It was awful but after that I didn’t throw up again. It’s day 2 and I still feel that swaying feeling. It only feels okay if I keep my head up with a pillow behind my head. 
Anyone can you please help figure out what this could be? Anyone had this experience?   ",1,1763520236.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

Fadi creep-ed out of the Babel doors. He went to the nearby woods. Towering trees stood over him, like giants about to crush him. He thought about their tyrant ruler, The Angels. He got on his knees and started digging with his bare hands. The dirt got into his finger nails. It got on his clothes. He was extremely dirty but he didn’t pay any mind. He finally got to a low enough point, where a red cloth finally revealed itself. He grabbed it slowly, lifting it out of the dirt. He looked around paranoid of if someone was watching him, breaking angel's law. It felt as if every animal in the forest was staring at him. No. Not staring glaring at him. They knew that if the angles were to smite him the and the animals would feel it as well . He opened the red bag. He had stashed it there years ago when he was 20. He carefully lifted out a map and compass. Cairo in Egypt was circled with the words, *Paradise* written in his own fathers blood. He held it close to his heart shedding a tear. It went down his cheek just like the Nile near Cairo. He stood up shakily. He walked for hours weaving through the forest mindlessly. He looked up into the sky to see not stars but his controlling overlords. He began anxiety creeping through his warm veins once again. He heard an agonizing scream coming from the skies. Four angles were holding an escapee up into the air. Slowly but surely pulling him apart. He knew he would have to listen to his screams for a few hours more as he traversed the jungle.

He tiptoed around the leaves and sticks careful not to share the fate of the man he heard being tortured. He looked up and was staring into two white pupils shooting right through him. A tiger he thought. This is where my life ends doesn’t it. It moved and he flinched back but instead of lunging it flew away into the night. It was an owl. "" Jeez "" he said under his breath.

A few minutes later he stepped on a vine. A tight rope shot out of the darkness and snatched his leg into a strangle hold. He was blasted into the air and started to hang from the top of a tree. He started to feel sick as he looked down at the ground. A hand from the dark reached at him like a snake lunging at him from tall grass. It grabbed his mouth silencing any noise coming from him. He felt lips near his ear whispering to him. "" Traveler, are you looking for *Paradise* hmm…” Fadi nodded slowly. "" Trust me paradise isn’t as good as it seems.” he uncovered his mouth. He responded "" My father is there he made this map for me when I turned 7. I need to get there.” The voice responded "" Master Anpu, was that his name?” Fadi gasped: "" how did you know!” The voice sighed "" He was the leader of paradise for a while till…….. The angels got to him. He's dead.” Well ….. he paused, "" He’s not exactly dead really. He's being used as a play toy for the angels. I don’t know where he his now. Though we found 9 of his fingers on the edge of the Nile.” Fadi started to cry silently, "" Why are they so CRUEL!” He babbled to himself. He gripped his shoulders and smacked him. "" Shut up! Do you want to die.” he let go of him and stepped back. "" If you want to see paradise we have to get to the next forest before dawn. We’ll be like bugs inside water. The man grabbed the vine and slowly lowered him to the ground he hit the grassy floor with pump. His head hit the root of nearby tree. The man jumped down and cut his leg binding with a bone wound knife. It was roughly strewn together with dark green vines with dirt covering it. The blade part was made of sharpened camel bone. Its handle was made of a deteriorated wooden piece. Fadi grabbed the man’s hand helping him stand up. Fadi looked up and realized how far he went up just a few minutes ago. The trees were towering over them. The man introduced himself as "" Ammon “. Fadi nodded and introduced himself. "" Come on, we need to get a move on.” Ammon whispered to Fadi who nodded silently. They started traversing through the thick and narrow forest. The roots of the trees were overgrown making the floor hard to walk on. The animals looked on curiously for they had never seen a human before. The moon beamed down between the tree leaves illuminating the pair every few steps. With his crude knife he tried to cut through the vines.

A few hours later

They had made a camp fire to cook a rat they found on their venture. Ammon slowly rolled the rat over the fire. Fadi was off into the forest collecting firewood. Ammon had a bad feeling about Fadi. "" His father? Its weird Master Anpu Came 25 years ago. How could he have given that map to *Paradise*. Maybe he left during the night and delivered it to his illegitimate son. Though it's weird, Master Anpu never mentioned him.” He thought to himself. Fadi was stepping around the forest in the dark wading aimlessly. A cold suddenly leaped through his body. His veins ran cold. He felt a strong breeze inside his clothes. His heart started beating slowly and felt freezing as well. He started to hyper ventilate as his lungs ran cold. He fell to his knees causing the leaves and duff crunch under his weight. He felt a slimy hand caress his cheek as his eyes shot open again. The slimy thing wrapped around his whole body making it even more difficult to breathe. There was a whisper in his ear with a raspy high pitched mixture to it. It was a voice that would only belong to an evil being making anyone to be chilly. "" Fadi. I heard your running from the angels.” The caressing continued on the other side of his face. He started to cry but the tears instantly froze. The thing began to speak again: "" You could join me, you know. I could make you as powerful as you want.” The world was spinning. It felt like he was being spun like a ball in a circle. His brain started to hurt. A blistering pain filled his head. Fadi felt like he would soon die due to the pain. The thing continued: "" You feel the pain don’t you? Hmm I can taste your fear. Do you want this power Fadi? To make the angels suffer? Hmm mm?” He felt a slimy tongue licking his forehead which was sweating profusely. "" Gosh there’s so much. So much FEAR! I could shrivel you up into a husk. I could take your soul and leave you wrinkled and dead. You wouldn’t want that,.. would you?” Fadi tried to escape his slimy grip. His grip got tighter: "" Trust me, I'll be back. The devil never lies, I'll have your soul when the angels have fallen.” The cold rushed out of his body and the slimy thing disappeared into the night. He ran back to the campsite tripping over himself. He arrived panting, his lungs were squeezed and his calves were on fire. "" d-d-devil.” Fadi hoarsely exclaimed. Ammon looked at him confused and replied: "" Fadi, what do you mean? Did something happen?” Ammon stood up slowly not sure what to do. He helped Fadi sit down on a log seat he had made. "" Fadi, tell me what happened in the forest.” No response came as the only sound that filled the surrounding area was that of the sparkling fire, its crackling making the silence sound even more deafening. Fadi slumped over falling backward. Ammon looked on without making a noise. He snubbed the fire and began dragging Fadi on the course ground.



***THE DESERT***

The sun began to rise, shining its blazing rays into the deep forest. A musky smell filled the air. Animals began to wake up. Fadi was still knocked out and Ammon was tired. He dragged his legs as he walked. He couldn’t handle it anymore and he dropped to the floor. The animals looked on in disappointment as they laid there. Fadi woke a few hours later as the afternoon sun made the dust in the air visible with a piney scent around the area. Fadi shakily stood up looking around. “Where are we?” He said under his breath. He shook Ammon violently. He coughed as his eyes opened, being blinded by the sunlight shining into the forest. "" What the hell are you doing man!” ( Cough,Cough ) "" Gosh could you have been less violent?” He groggily said to Fadi. Fadi nodded indignantly. Ammon got up on his feet brushing off the dirt on his cloth robes. "" It looks like we're taking longer than we should've. We have to stay low. If we keep at this pace we can cross to the end of the forest by the end of the day and cross the desert overnight.” Ammon told Fadi. "" Okay, if we don't, should we wait?” Ammon nodded. They started their treacherous journey across the forest. The air smelled of dirty animals, old plants and sap covered trees. If you listened closely you could hear ants marching with small remains of dead animals or any other form of food they could find. The sky’s edge turned blood red as the sunset began. Soon after the pair reached the forest's end and looked upon the deserts barren wasteland.

***June 28th 1988***

He slammed the book closed. ( What a weirdo. He’s gone mad, he has) He grabbed the rough handle of his recliner and lifted, making his chair stand upright. He stood up from his red and black entwined recliner. On the arm rest was an embroiled name in golden letters: (*Jefferson)* He never knew the man. He bought it second hand when he moved into his apartment. He slowly sauntered over to his small but usable window. It was slightly fogged up due to the winter season. He opened it to allow fresh air in. ( As fresh as I can get in this dumpster of a city). He heard honking in the distance though the street he lived on was mostly empty of cars. He looked down and saw a man standing under a street light. He looked dead. His body was slumping downwards. The street around mirrored how he looked. His clothes were ripped and disheveled. There was dirt on his pants and visible injection sites all over his arms. Even though it was thirty-three out he was wearing a darkly stained wife beater. There was wet trash everywhere around the man. It reeked of dog and aged urine including excrement. Cocaine*. I remember when I was there.* He remembered. *ROCK BOTTOM. The words rang through his mind. It bounced in his head like a loud echo chamber. It rang and rang. Repeating, torturing him with its noise. It* prickled him, taunting his mind. ( I remember. It was only 10 years ago. He was 19 years old and fresh into college. He went to a fraternity party. They were drinking. Someone over 21 brought it there. Someone handed him a line of cocaine. Never having drugs in his life he was exhilarated by the thought. He sniffed it up like it was his first glass of water after 10 years in the desert. His vision went blurry. He stumbled around and fell to his knees. His brain started to ache, like someone had blown a bomb next to him. He screamed out in pain. Then all of it went away. It was gone. He looked around and everyone looked like black squares. He felt euphoric, like all the struggles of his life were lifted off his shoulders. He felt light as a feather. If someone blew on him he would fly onto the road.) His eyes focused again and snapped back to reality. The man was on the street asleep now, lying on the floor. He felt the chilly air coming in through the window and immediately shut it. He shook his head and went to the bathroom stepping over the cardboard pizza box. He opened the ancient looking wooden door with a dirty golden knob. There were silver accents visible over the white paint the hinges had been doused in. The bathroom was narrow and barely had enough room to stand in. The shower mixed bath was in the forest point away from the door with a deep gray curtain covering it. The toilet was standard white porcelain though the floor around it was dirty with grout. ( I need to clean this up) He thought to himself begrudgingly. His sink had two dirt glass knobs that represent *Hot* and *Cold.* The sink was dirty and had a yellow ring around the drain. There was hair sticking out of it which disgusted him. He turned the knob to the coldest and washed his face with it. He rubbed his face and turned off the faucet. He looked at himself. ( Short haired, rough stubble, brown hair and eyes. He wasn't in the best shape though he was acceptable for his age.) *RING RING RING RING.* He looked towards the kitchen and walked over to it. His kitchen had white tiles *and* brown cabinet*s,* including brown counter tops*.* He picked up the sleek black phone attached to *the wall. ""* Hello? Who is this.” The voice coughed and replied: "" Scott, we need you down at the station we're about to make the catch.” His face scrunched slightly and asked: "" What catch?” "" Remember the meeting up at the Burger King.” He responded with okay and hung up. He looked at his calendar. and saw the address of the Burger King. He grabbed his brown coat from his rustic coat rack. He opened his front door with a loud “*creeeeeeek” Golden* letters *adorned the* bronze plate "" *17 ""* He stepped down the stone stairs. Avoiding the cobweb filled railing. He got into his bright yellow Ford Pinto. The inside was filled with trash and any sort of nick knack he could find at stores. He was an impulsive buyer, and when anything caught his fancy he would buy it. He turned the key and the car burst to life. The engine filled the silence of the parking spaces around here. Disrupting its chilly silence. The headlights were barely visible under the street lights, though after he exited the lights lit up his way. He then remembered what happened just a few minutes ago. The book he was reading was that of an wealthy old author that had been missing for 2 weeks. This was found bound together in a locked box. The rest of the 200 pages worth of book were filled with the words "" *I KILLED HER* "" The words haunted him ever since he read it. He was on trial for the murder of his secret affair. A young 20 year old lady named Vanessa. She was found dead dumped a few miles away from his vacation home. He disappeared before he could go on trial, or even get caught by the police. It seems like this was proof enough. He would tell his chief once they had finished the catch. They didn’t know what the person looked like, only knowing he was in his mid 40s. He had been sending letters to young high school girls. They got a decoy and they would catch him tonight. He arrived at the Burger King and went in. His chief was hiding behind the counter and ushered him over. The bright fluorescent light of the building hurt his eyes and he blinked to help relax his eyes. He went behind the counter and crouched down. "" Scott, our decoy is almost here, if you came any later the goblin would be suspicious. "" Scott nodded and chuckled at his chief's remark. "" Where's Jeffery.” He asked. The chief responded "" I don’t know, said he was sick.” Scott nodded and carried on waiting. The decoy came in a few minutes later. 20 in age but 17-18 in appearance. "" Jeffery. "" She said in a mild tone. She looked around until a bald man was waving at her. "" Over Here! "" He exclaimed excitedly. Scott and the others hopped over the counter with their guns in their hands. "" LIFT YOUR HANDS!” They all exclaimed. Then Scott dropped his gun. It slammed into the white tiled floor making a loud crash. It was his best friend Jeffery. He was sitting there with a shocked expression on his face. Then Scott’s vision was filled with a shade of red. His eyes were burning and a violent rage pulsed through him. Unknowingly his body moved on its own. Acting separate from his head. He lunged at Jeffery, like a lion pouncing onto an unknowing gazelle. He let a guttural roar as his unit held him back, struggling against his pulsating body. "" HOW COULD YOU! "" His friend shoved him to the floor. He remembered this exact scenario though under different circumstances. (He was in a drug induced rage. It was near a bust down pizza place. He had given the manager nine dollars even though the pizza was 7.50. The owner said "" Have a nice day! "" joyfully though you could tell he did it begrudgingly. You could tell he was a pretentious idiot by the way he held himself. Bright embroidered letters spelling out his name, under it was his title *"" Manager ""* He held himself high and he looked at customers with a look of disgust as people turned their backs to him. He grinned at people with a mannequin-like PR smile. He had not given Scott the thirty-three cents extra he had owed him. The same feeling of pulsating rage ran through him and he lunged at the manager. He looked as Jeffery was carried away in hand cuffs. He saw him mouth the words: "" I’m sorry Scott, I truly am.” 

***THE Therapist***

The room was a musty yellow. The light shined into the office. The office smelled of old wood. The scent filled Scott’s nose. His chief's desk was filled with a mess of papers. Manila folders were sprawled open. He noticed one of the top papers closest to the middle of the desk. "" *Letter to the board*. "" It was written in big bold print letters. Under it were a few messy lines. He could make out most of it though another paper was covering some of it. "" *Scott Simmons has had a leap of anger. I w ——— I believe he should visit a therapist of some sort to help with his anger.”* He stopped reading. The silence was deafening in the room. A ringing began to develop in his ears to fill the silence. The chief looked at him solemnly and began to speak "" Scott, I believe you know why you're here.” Scott looked down and nodded. "" Are you back on pills? "" Scott spoke under his breath and responded "" *no “* The chief nodded. "" You need help with your anger, so that I can convince the board to keep you.” Scott wiped his lips which at that point were drier than the Sahara. "" So you want me to visit a shrink then?” He nodded and reached into the inner pocket of his dark linen suit. He pulled a business card slowly out of his pocket. He pushed the card toward the other edge of the desk. It read *"" Dr. Fortatum. 13,W, Shock Checker dr. 1-871-9091”* He looked down at the card and wiped his forehead, he hadn’t noticed how much he was sweating. The room was hot and stuffy. He pulled his collar forward trying to loosen his clothes slightly to let more air in. He took the card and stuffed it into his respective inner pocket of his worn brown leather jacket. He stood up pushing the chair back which made a terrible screeching across the wooden floor. He walked out of the office dazed. He felt sick, like he was going to die. The door closed behind him. He looked back and saw the lit up golden plaque on the door ( *Chief, Jonathon.*) He turned back as his co-worker waved at him standing up from his plain looking cubicle. "" He ya Scott! You gonna be kept on the team?” Scott stared bullets through him. At that moment he couldn’t stand talking to anyone. He shrugged and Craig looked at him with a half frown on his chubby face. Scott walked out of the building not looking back to see Craig’s disappointed expression. The prescient parking lot was mostly empty. Mid day was a hot time for crime around here. Though at night you would be lucky to see a trace of life. He got into his bright red Ford Pinto. He felt something was wrong but he couldn’t place his finger on it. It felt like the world had shifted around him. He rubbed his face. He felt insane,like he was losing his mind. He turned the key to his Pinto and started on the Road. *God I hate Traffic.* He thought as the line moved slowly forward on the highway. He didn’t play his radio, he wanted to have his thoughts to himself. When he stopped at a red light he looked around observing the area. An alleyway caught his eye. A symbol painted in red paint. It was painted on the orange crackled brick wall. It was two hands clasped together, as if in a prayer. He heard honking behind him as he got out of his haze. He looked forward and saw the green light. He pushed his foot onto the gas pedal. He arrived at his apartment and a deep scowl swept across his face when he saw his neighbor Becky. She had large caramel brown hair and wore bright blue overalls with a white tee under it. She was tending to her planter boxes which resided right underneath the stair to his apartment. He got out begrudgingly, he wanted to stay inside his car to wait to enter back into her apartment. He never wanted to talk to her, especially after a bad day. He walked slowly towards his stairs hoping she wouldn’t notice him. "" Oh! Hey Scott, how ya doin?” He looked at her shooting bullets boring into her. She frowned and turned away. He walked up the stairs still avoiding the cobwebby railing. He put his key into the door, turning it slowly, shaking at the thought of going to therapy. He opened the door and went in. He went to his fridge and took out a lukewarm scotch bottle. He pulled out a small glass and pulled out ice filling the bottom of the cup with it. The ice clanged to the bottom dissipating the outside sounds of Jacky’s gleeful humming for just a second. He filled the glass and brought it to his parched lips. The bronze liquid slid down his throat, burning it slightly but lifting the stress on his shoulders. It flew away, now light as a feather. He went to his wall telephone and dialed the therapist's number cringing about having to go. He gritted his teeth and thought to himself: "" I have to do this to keep my job.” The phone rang for a few seconds before the phone was picked up. "" Hello, this is Dr. Fortatum’s office. How can I help you.” She sounded like a young lady probably fresh out of college looking for any job she could get. With a deadpan expression on, he responded in a joyful tone "" I’d like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Fortatum.” She on the other side with a tired expression responded "" Of Course! I’ll transfer you right now.” They were both faking their happiness but they would never know that. The call cut out before a man’s voice came over the phone. "" This is Dr. Fortatum, may I know whom I have the pleasure of speaking to?” His voice was incredibly fake. Scott had to hold in a laugh. His voice sounded as if it had been curated after years of PR training. It screamed that he did this to impress his higher ups. On Fortatum’s side he looked at the door to his room with a grim deflated expression on his face. "" Scott Simmons, is the name. I would like to schedule an appointment.” Fortatum responded with surprise. "" Ah! The person ole Jonathon told me about. I’m very popular with people from the department. I heard you need help with your anger. I should be helpful. I have many techniques to help with anger. If you read the card you can see I specialize in the art of anger management.” (*Cut the PR speech you prick!)* He thought to himself angrily. “ So are you free tomorrow at 2:30?” Fortatum replied “ Of course. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:30 then.” He signed off with his catchphrase *(MAY YOUR BRAIN BE WELL!)*  The phone hung up and Scott laughed to himself but quickly stopped himself as he remembered that he had to get to cleaning his place. His front door opened to his small kitchen. It was narrow and on the left side there were cabinets and a stove under them. They were hazel nut brown and in the middle of them there was an exhaust hood and right under it was a stove and oven mixture. It was white but was yellow in some places from food residue. On the other side there were more cabinets and opposite to the stove was the sink. It was wide and metallic with a long snout sticking out of it like a small elephant. Next to it was a white pale fridge. The majority of the space was for the fridge. The small compartment on top was a freezer. Then the room turned and around the turn was the living room. Against the wall there was his television. The floor transitioned from hard wood flooring into a soft carpet. In the middle of the room was the red and black entwined recliner with the words *(Jefferson)* inscribed into it. There were boxes of random bits and bobs and cola bottles thrown askew. The room reeked of old food that had been sitting there for a while. A hallway leading out of the living room contained the bathroom and the bedroom. On the closer part to the living room there was the door that led to the bathroom. At the end of the hall was his bedroom. He walked in and saw his plain bed which wasn't made yet. His top sheets which were pale and white and were coming off the bed. His pillows were thrown askew and the pillow was coming out of its case. He groaned slightly and plopped down onto the bed. He laid down and stared at the barren gray ceiling. He slowly began to drift into his sleep. He dropped deeper and deeper and finally fell asleep. The next day he woke up around [12.Pm](http://12.Pm) feeling like he had blacked out. *( Though he knew that he hadn't drunk that much.)* He got up and left the room. He went into his kitchen stepping over the *cola* bottles on his way. He saw a manila *post-it* and it read “ Remember Appointment with shrink at 2:30. The conversation came back to him and so did the fact that he had planned to clean his house. He didn't feel like it. Not a single muscle in his body wanted to clean. He went back into the living room and turned on the TV, he grabbed the remote and sat down on his recliner. He found the news channel. The newscaster *( who introduced himself as Jaren)* began speaking about last night's incidents. “Good Afternoon New York City, wasn't that game sure a surprising victory for the Jets. Go Jets ya know what I mean? Well after that we have received news that last night two bodies were found in a backstreet next to a liquor store.” Scott thought to himself “ Jeez New York is going down the drain.” The caster continued “ They are suspected to be part of an infamous gangster group, and it is suspected that this was a drug deal gone wrong. One of the men identified as Gregory Gentraficha.” A picture of the man appeared on screen. He looked tired and beaten, which reminded Scott of himself at the current moment. “ He was holding 3,000 dollars and a note which was stuffed into the inner pocket of his jacket. Written on it was a direct order.” They showed a picture of the note which read *( Kill Porta and grab the product. Show the money to him and when he turns his back stab him. Don't use a gun, it's too loud for a public area. You can keep the money I give you including a 30,000 bonus which you will receive on the 25th of November at 7:52 on the train leading to Brooklyn.)* Jaren continued “ Well folks that seems proof enough, moving onto other news. A new bakery makes headli—” He shut the TV off and looked down at his watch. It read 1:25. He gets up realizing he had to leave now if he wanted to grab a bite before going. He grabbed his keys and went down to his Pinto and turned the key revving up the engine as the cooler began blowing onto his skin, giving him chills. He started driving, stopping at a McDonald's and started on his way to Fortatum’s office. He arrived at the address at 2:20. The building was a big square with no architectural difference from any old office building. There was a sign at the front that read *“ Dr. Fortatum’s Office”* Under his name were his specialties. *“ Anger-Relanshonship-Deppresion”* He felt like this was some sort of trap. The building seemed so uniform and friendly but it made him weirdly nauseated and the hairs on his arms stood up. He got out of his car and walked in as a bell above the door rang. The lobby was small. On the left side there was a solitary hazel nut door with a silver knob that was shining, like it had recently been scrubbed clean. Above that ( a few feet or so) was a golden plaque that read *“ Dr.Fortatum.”* In the middle was a round receptionist desk. The lady sat on her office chair reading a magazine as she laid her legs onto the desk. There were papers strewn all over and around the desk. There was a small room behind the desk that had a printer, fax machine and an abundance of spare office supplies. She quickly adjusted herself and joyfully asked “ What can I do for you today?” Scott looked around again and responded “ I have a 2:30 appointment with Dr, Fortatum.” She looked down and flipped through a notebook and landed on a page. He couldn't read most of the page but at the top *July, 30th,1988.* She looked back up and said “ Mr. Simmons, I presume?” Scott nodded and Fortatum opened the door allowing him in. The room was built with a dark oak. The pillars were a deep brown almost black. There was a ruby red recliner chair that laid across from a small gray chair with a multi colored pillow. In the middle was a small dark brown coffee table. There laid multiple neatly stacked Psychology Today magazines. On top of a small glass coaster there was a lukewarm cup of black coffee. On the walls were fine pieces of art work including an original from Van Ghough. There was also a picture of the street leading out of the prescient. The picture was dated *June, 29th, 1988* in it you could see a man spray painting the logo he saw that day. ( Why did he have that? Who would even take such a boring picture? Even better yet why did he have it framed in his office only after a day.) “ Sit down Scott, let's talk, you're not paying to stare at my office walls now are you?” Fortatum flashed him a PR trained smile that screamed to him, I don't really care about your problems, I just want that one-hundred and twenty dollars for 60 minutes. More silently it said that he was a greedy bastard that thought he was better due to his taste in all forms of things. Scott sat down laying back on the dark ruby red chair. Fortatum started to say “ Well I’ll start off with a hopefully simple question, what causes you to be angry?” In fact it was not a simple question. He couldn't exactly pinpoint why he did. He just felt a surge of anger sometimes. Just like when he aimlessly jumped at the pretentious pity manager, when he didn't give him his thirty-three cents. He had been off drugs for many years, when he lunged at Jeremy. It was weird he hadn’t felt that rage in a desperate amount of time.

At one point I was consuming alcohol several times a week just like it was a glass of OJ, yet I never developed any addiction and now I haven't regularly drank alcohol for months due to some dental issues.

I am wondering if my ADHD could be interfering with the process that creates addiction and if this is the case for other people.

1p0vtvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1p0vtvv/my_experience_while_hunting_at_a_mountain_in/,My Experience While Hunting at a Mountain in Southern Utah.,"You know, I still replay the events of this trip in my head, even though it all happened a few years ago now. It was supposed to be the ultimate hunting expedition a classic buddy trip with my friend Gabe down to the Henry Mountains. 

I'd hunted all over Utah, but nothing prepared me for what we experienced down there. It’s hard to even talk about it without getting that cold, sinking feeling in my gut. What started as the fulfillment of a long held dream quickly turned into a week of dread, culminating in an encounter that changed how I look at the wilderness forever.

The kind of anticipation Gabe and I felt that November morning was almost painful. We’d been planning this trip for over a year, ever since we successfully snagged the permits to hunt the Henry Mountains. Anyone who knows anything about big game knows that these mountains, five hours south of our hometown in Salt Lake City, are legendary. They hold giant mule deer that rival anything in the Rockies, and a genetically pure herd of bison you can’t find anywhere else. 

Those permits felt like lottery winnings, and we were practically buzzing as we packed up the RV for the long drive down. The air was crisp and cold, already smelling like winter even though the official snow hadn't hit yet. We talked smack the entire drive, arguing over who would bag the bigger buck, fueled by stale gas station coffee and the sheer excitement of finally heading out to the high desert. This wasn't any normal hunting trip, it was a pilgrimage.

We finally found our spot, pulling the RV up near a dramatic cliff face. The view alone made the five hour trek worth the time and expense. Looking east, the expanse of Utah’s canyonlands unfolded in a breathtaking panorama. The light was starting to turn golden as the sun dipped, painting the rugged landscape in a hue that honestly stopped us in our tracks. It was the kind of vista that felt too big for humanity, instantly making you feel small and insignificant. 

We started setting up the basic camp, and right away, we felt a difference in this place. It wasn't just quiet; it was heavy. We saw the usual sign wolf scat and tracks but then Gabe found a massive paw print near the dry creek bed, too large and oddly shaped to be a standard black bear. It was unsettling, but we shook it off as a mountain lion or maybe just a misidentified bear. Our goal was to get camp secured before dark, so we were running lines for a canopy and hanging up some powerful LED lanterns. That's when I noticed it: hanging low from the branch of an ancient juniper tree was a crude, disturbing object. 

It was a totem made of old, dry sticks lashed together with leather strips, covered in faded feathers. It looked old and intentional. We both stared at it for a moment. ""Native folks probably used it for a blessing or something,"" Gabe mumbled, already pulling it down. I felt a weird prickle of discomfort, like we shouldn’t touch it, but we were focused on utility. We tossed the thing deep into a thicket of scrub oak just outside our lit perimeter and got back to work. As soon as that totem left the tree, the quiet atmosphere turned sharp, like a dropped knife.

The trouble started almost immediately after we discarded the strange marker. It began subtly, with faint, ambient sounds that we initially dismissed as the wind playing tricks. But soon, it evolved into something more focused, like whispers. They weren't loud enough to make out, just a low, indistinct murmur, like someone speaking a language we’d never heard, just beyond the edge of our hearing. It was constant, a low level static that frayed the nerves. 

One night, a few days into the trip, we were just settling down, listening to the crackle of the fire. The air was dead still. Then, from the dense forest line near the cliff's edge, a sound rose up a profound, heartbroken mourning. It wasn’t an animal’s cry, it was distinctly human, full of anguish and sorrow, a sound that chilled you to the bone. It didn't last long, maybe twenty seconds, but the silence that followed felt absolute, crushing. Another evening, while we were around the campfire enjoying a much deserved dinner of chili and cornbread, the forest ripped open with a horrible, piercing scream. 

I’ve heard injured animals before and that definitely was not an injured animal, it was prolonged and guttural, ending in a choke. We grabbed our rifles, hearts hammering, and searched with flashlights, but there was nothing. No tracks, no disturbed brush, just the same oppressive silence that seemed to swallow sound whole. There were other nights, too, when we’d wake up to the rhythmic beat of drums and deep, rhythmic chanting, like some sort of ancient ritual or dance party was happening just out of sight in the deeper woods, invisible behind the veil of night.

It was becoming clear that whatever this presence was, it was trying to mess with our heads, trying to lure us away from the safety of the RV. The most chilling example of this was the night I was jolted awake by Gabe violently shaking my arm. ""Will, wake up! Do you hear that?"" My ears were ringing in the dark silence, and then I heard it the unmistakable, thin cry of a baby coming from the trees. 

We spent an agonizing hour trying to find the source, eventually calling Search and Rescue, convinced a lost infant was freezing out there. SAR arrived hours later, searched, and found absolutely nothing. They looked at us like we were crazy. The next afternoon, the thing tried to trick me directly. I was cleaning my hunting rifle, doing some final checks, when I heard Gabe’s voice calling my name excitedly from the edge of the woods. ""Will! Come quick, you gotta see this! I found something cool!"" He was motioning rapidly for me to hurry. I secured the rifle and took three steps toward him when a voice, clear and solid, said right behind me, ""Hey Will, where ya going?"" I spun around so fast my neck cracked. There, standing just outside the RV door, was the real Gabe, looking bewildered, wiping grease from his hands. 

I whipped my head back toward the forest where the decoy had been, and there was nothing. No movement, no sign of anyone or anything. Gabe must have seen the blood drain from my face because he dropped his rag and asked what was wrong. I just shook my head, unable to articulate the sheer horror of seeing my best friend beckon me into the woods, knowing it wasn't him.

The night before we were scheduled to head back to Salt Lake City, we were completely exhausted from a full day of hunting that yielded nothing but frustration. We collapsed into our bunks around 10 PM. I guess we were so tired that the events of the last week didn't register until 2:00 AM, when a sound ripped me out of a deep sleep. 

It was laughter, but not human laughter. It was a high pitched, rasping sound, like a bird’s shriek mixed with a human snicker, coming from right outside the RV. It felt mocking and malicious. Before either of us could fully sit up, the entire RV started to shake violently not a tremor, but a rapid, rhythmic shaking, like something massive was grabbing it and trying to flip it over. The sound was deafening. When the shaking suddenly stopped, Gabe was instantly alert. 

He grabbed his .30-06 and, believing it was a very large, aggressive bear, flung the RV door open. He didn't even aim, just started shooting three rapid rounds into the absolute darkness, yelling, ""Damn bear!"" All I could hear was the booming of the rifle, and then, a sickening sound: an animal’s fierce growl, immediately followed by a faint, wretched human groan. Gabe had hit something, because the next sound was something heavy and fast crashing away through the dense, dry brush, running deeper into the forest. We spent the rest of the night wide awake, guns drawn, listening to the deep silence that followed.

We didn't sleep another wink. As the first light of dawn began to paint the sky with streaks of brilliant pink, we cautiously stepped out, armed and terrified. The first thing we saw was the devastation around the RV flattened ground, bent saplings, and then, unmistakable evidence of the night’s encounter. There was a huge, fresh paw print, far too big to belong to any black bear, and clear drops of blood leading away from the side of the vehicle. Gabe didn't hesitate. 

We followed the trail of blood and the massive prints leading directly toward the secluded part of the cliff face, the same place the mourning had come from days earlier. The trail ended at an old, gnarled tree right at the cliff's edge. Gabe, focused on the prints, walked straight under its branches. “Think the bear jumped?” he whispered, his voice catching in his throat. He turned back to look at me, but I had stopped about twenty feet back, staring up at the tree, a wave of cold nausea washing over me as the horrifying truth dawned on me. Gabe, seeing my pale, fixed gaze, looked up, too. Hanging from the high branches, wrapped in fading funerary cloth and aged offerings, was a perfectly preserved Native American burial bundle. He was standing directly on hallowed, sacred ground. 

My heart hammered with the realization that we hadn't been dealing with a bear or a mountain lion; we had disturbed something ancient and powerful by removing that totem. We didn't exchange another word. We raced back to the RV, packed our gear in a blur of panicked efficiency, and drove the five hours straight back to Salt Lake City, leaving the Henry Mountains behind us forever. I am convinced to this day that we tangled with something darker than any predator a Skinwalker or perhaps a Windigo. Whatever it was, the whole sequence of events, from the baby crying to the decoy of Gabe, was nothing more than a carefully orchestrated attempt to lure us into the woods so it could finish what we started when we tossed that totem into the brush.",3,1763520052.0,Paranormal,3,1.0,False

I’m mainly looking at row homes that have some charm in the neighborhoods mentioned and hoping to find somewhere that will be a good fit for me as someone in their late 20s! I would love to be living in a welcoming & friendly community that also is pretty walkable! 

**A few things I love (not deal breakers, but definitely bonuses!):**

* coffee shops
* yoga/pilates studios
* beginner pottery or art spots
* walk clubs or other community events
* closer to patterson park or by the water (all dependent on what y'all suggest!) 
* able to walk to grocery/drug stores
* wandering around on foot to explore local places instead of driving everywhere

For those of you in Canton, Fells Point, Brewers Hill, or Highlandtown — what do you love about your neighborhood? Any downsides or things you wish you knew before moving in?

I appreciate any insight and guidance as I know this will definitely make me feel more at ease hearing from locals! This is a big and exciting move for me, but with doing it on a limited time frame, I have some natural nervousness as I want to find the ""right fit"" for where I will be living.

Not much else to report, lets see how long this fast can go.

1p0vjs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p0vjs4/my_mom_sent_me_a_christmas_gift_i_think_its/,My mom sent me a Christmas gift. I think it’s breathing?,"My mom sent me a Christmas gift and I’m pretty sure it’s breathing. I’m not quite sure what to do from here, if I’m going to be honest. 

Six years ago, I moved across country to live  with the love of my life, and every year since then, my mother has sent me a gift every Christmas. At first, I would get your usual bits and bobbles - hand lotion, candles, cute decorations, candy, etc. It was the one little connection that I still had with my parents, and something I would look forward to around the holidays. 

A few years ago, the things she sent started to become less cutesy and more niche, but my parents were the evangelical prepping type, so I shrugged it off as them being odd, and tried to appreciate the fact that I was still in their minds, and at the least, that they were tying to protect me somehow. For example, a few years back, they sent me a lamb-skin bible stamped with a golden symbol I didn’t recognize - this was odd because not only were my fiancé and I not inherently religious, but I’m an animal lover, so the thought of a lamb being slaughtered and used for this book was off putting to say the least. 

Next, Jason and I opened a package that had both of our names on it, and in it we found two CB radios with a note that read:

“ Merry Christmas. You need to download the software on the CD you’ll find in the box. Your call sign is Polaris1277. Jason will need to come up with his own call sign. It is very important that you do this. 

From: Curt and June” 

I remember feeling uneasy after reading that, and in a way, almost hurt? Why didn’t they just call themselves mom and dad? I don’t know, I may have been overthinking it, but that being said, I never did download that software, and I never turned on those radios. 

The year after that, I received a burgundy wooden box, and in it lay a peculiar knife. I honestly thought it was some fancy pairing knife, and have been using it as such for years. But the symbols on the blade always perplexed me, if I’m being honest. Though, I tried not to think about it too much. Until now, actually. 

All in all, it’s safe to say that after the last few years, I actually might dread receiving a package from my parents. Today, as  I was pulling into my driveway, a large box sitting on the front porch, caught my eye. Thinking it was something I had ordered, I excitedly placed the car in park and sauntered over. But the closer I got, I could read the large red words: “FRAGILE” on the package and knew that whatever it was, wasn’t what I had ordered. 

“Jas!” 

I called for my fiancé as I plopped the box on our dining room table - it was pretty heavy if I’m being honest.

“Jason, come open this with me! I think it’s from my mom!” 

I heard him tell his friends something before getting off his computer, and when he walked out of the bedroom, he sighed softly and his lips curled into  a sheepish smile, as if he was saying, ‘Oh boy, are you sure you even want to open that?’

I didn’t. I really did not want to open that fucking package, but I couldn’t just throw it away, I would feel too guilty. 

“It’s kind of a big box this time, what do you think is in here? I’ll give you one good guess. Deal?” 

Jason examined the box for a minute and then said, 

“ i thiiiiink we haaaave a….. hmmm.” 

He scrunched up his face almost in a mocking puzzled expression before blurting out his answer, 

“ Computer! “

I laughed and then reached for the scissors to cut the tape on the box, 

“ Let’s see if you’re right. If not, you owe me a coffee.” 

I received a look of disapproval, which made me smile. As I pulled the cardboard flaps apart, and pushed away moist paper wrapping, that smile faded as fast as it appeared. 

What I saw in that box was a wet heap of hair. Fur? I don’t know. I reached my hand down wearily, and when I touched the ball of  whatever it was, my fingers were coated in red. 

“ What the fuck?!” 

Jason didn’t move, he just kept staring at that thing, jaw dropped in shock. His skin washed of color, and I could see the panic in his eyes.

“What the fuck. What. The fuck. Is this? Is this a joke?”

I rushed to the sink to get that warm, red goo off of my hand as fast as I could, and I could feel my heart literally pound. God, I felt disgusting. Scared. Why my parents put carnage in a box for their daughter? I couldn’t figure that out. 

Jason let out a weird squeal type noise, and thats when I turned around to see him reaching in the box, 

“It’s moving…” 

He whispered, and I rushed back over to the table and watched as he poked the fur ball once, then again. And I could have sworn I watched that…thing move like the rise and fall of a gentle breath. 

“Wait. Wait!” 

I stared at the monstrosity and waited. Waited to see the rise of the fur again, and I swear it felt like forever before I caught it again. Sure enough, the ball rose slowly, softly, and then fell. 

Jason must’ve seen it too because he whipped his hand out of the box and stumbled backward a step. It was at that moment I reached for the package and flipped the cardboard top back, closing in whatever was in there. I was almost tempted to tape it back up and take it outside, but part of me also wanted to help it. 

After a brief discussion, we decided to bring the box into the garage while I try to get in contact with my mother. I could have sworn I heard noises coming from the creature inside as I carried it out - faint, short bursting whines. I set the box down on the concrete floor anyways, and practically sprinted out before closing the garage door behind me. Trapping the ‘gift’ somewhere safe as I attempt to get some answers. 

It’s been about an hour, and I have reached my mom’s voicemail four times. I can’t stop thinking about what might be suffering in my garage, but I really don’t know what else to do. I’ll post again once I hear an update.

For now, wish me luck.

The sensations consist of tingling/crawling/pins-and-needles sensations throughout my whole body-and when I say whole, I mean literally everywhere. The tingling typically starts at the base of the top of my neck (right above my shoulder blades) and then will transcend down into my lower limbs, including my arms, legs, hands, feet, and even torso. Oftentimes I’ll get the tingling on my head and face, and it feels like bugs are crawling all over-it drives me absolutely insane.

I do take an SSRI (escitalopram 10mg) once daily, but I don’t see how this would cause these sensations in any way. I’d also like to mention that I did have an MRI of my head done in October, and the results came back all clear with no findings whatsoever. My neurologist also suggested that I get an MRI of my C-spine done, but I’ve had to postpone that until I’ve paid all the expenses for my head MRI. I’ve also had bloodwork done and no abnormalities were found.

I exercise roughly 3x a week, I do weights maybe once a week and the other two days I’ll do Pilates. I take vitamins like D3, magnesium glycerinate, vitamin E, and omega-3. I maintain a very healthy diet and keep my sugar intake low (except for maybe one coffee a day with sweetened creamer). I’m not sure what to do, and I know scouring through the internet is quite literally the last thing I should do-but I’ve consistently been given nerve pain prescriptions that haven’t helped and I’ve had it all marked down to just being anxiety. I’m getting so stressed out that it’s something way worse and that finding the root cause to all of this is getting delayed.

I. The Discovery

There were children born without fixed positions in time.

Not time-travelers. Not unstuck. They simply existed as probability clouds across multiple moments simultaneously until someone observed them, at which point they collapsed into a single timeline.

Dr. Ashima Khoury identified the first case in Lagos, 2047. A five-year-old named Emmanuel whose parents reported he was simultaneously at school, at home, and at his grandmother's house in Abuja. Not lying. Not mistaken. Genuinely occupying three spatial positions until someone needed him to be specifically somewhere.

The moment his mother called for him, he collapsed into one location. But before that call, he had been all three places with equal reality.

Ashima's tests revealed something unprecedented: Emmanuel's neurons existed in quantum superposition, his consciousness spread across multiple timeline branches until decision or observation forced coherence.

Within eighteen months, six hundred cases appeared globally. Always children. Always under seven years old. The medical community called it Parametric Existence Syndrome.

The children called it being awake.


---

II. The Rules

Parametric children had constraints:

Rule One: Observation Collapse
When an authority figure—parent, teacher, doctor—specifically required their presence, they collapsed into a single timeline. Until then, they existed as probability distributions across all timelines where their choices diverged.

Rule Two: Mutual Observation
When two parametric children observed each other, neither collapsed. They could see each other's multiplicities—all the versions simultaneously. Normal children saw only one version, whichever timeline the observer happened to occupy.

Rule Three: Age Limit
At seven years old, something in neural development forced permanent collapse. The children became fixed in a single timeline forever. They called this ""going grey.""

Rule Four: Memory Multiplicity
Parametric children remembered all their timeline branches simultaneously. They knew what happened when they chose the red cup and when they chose the blue cup, when they told the truth and when they lied, when they ran and when they stayed.

They remembered every version of love and every version of loss.


---

III. The School

The Coherence Institute opened in Reykjavik, designed specifically for parametric children.

Its architecture was paradoxical—rooms that existed in multiple configurations simultaneously, corridors that led to different destinations depending on who walked them, a cafeteria that served lunch and breakfast and dinner at the same moment.

The school's founder, Dr. Yuki Tanaka (no relation to the geometry cartographer, though history would later wonder), understood that teaching parametric children required abandoning the assumption of singular reality.

In normal schools, when a teacher asked, ""What is 2+2?"" children answered ""4.""

In Coherence Institute, the answer was: ""4 in the timeline where we're using base-10. 10 in binary. 11 in base-3. All simultaneously true until you specify which mathematics we're using.""

Parametric children didn't learn subjects. They learned metamathematics—the patterns that held true across all possible mathematical systems. Metalanguage—the structures underlying all possible grammars. Metaethics—the principles that remained good across all cultural frameworks.

They were being educated for a reality where specificity itself was optional.


---

IV. The Girl Who Chose Everything

Amara Okonkwo was five years old and existed in forty-seven timelines simultaneously.

In one timeline, her mother had died in childbirth. In another, her mother was president of Nigeria. In a third, her mother had never met her father. In a fourth, Amara herself had been born male.

She remembered all of them.

When people asked, ""Where is your mother?"" Amara would pause, sorting through forty-seven answers, and eventually say: ""Which one?""

At Coherence Institute, she met Kenji, another parametric child who existed in ninety-three timelines.

""I die in seventeen of them,"" Kenji said matter-of-factly during lunch, which was simultaneously breakfast and dinner. ""Car accident. Leukemia. Drowning. I remember dying. It's cold and then it's nothing and then I'm still here in the other timelines, remembering the nothing.""

Amara had died in three timelines. Drowned once. Hit by a car once. Something in her sleep that the doctors never identified once.

""Does it hurt?"" she asked.

""Only in the timelines where it hurt,"" Kenji said. ""In the others, it was just stopping.""

They became friends across all possible timelines, which meant they were friends in ways singular-timeline people couldn't comprehend. They knew every version of their friendship—the one where they fought on the second day, the one where Kenji moved away, the one where Amara got sick and Kenji visited every day, the one where they never spoke again after graduation.

They were simultaneously best friends and strangers and enemies and each other's first love and people who'd forgotten each other's names.

They chose to collapse toward the timeline where they stayed friends. Every day, that choice.


---

V. The Adults

Parents of parametric children suffered uniquely.

Amara's father existed in only one timeline—the standard human condition. When he called for Amara, she collapsed from forty-seven possibilities into the single timeline he occupied.

But which timeline was it?

The one where he was patient or irritable? Successful or struggling? Married or divorced?

The version of Amara who collapsed into his timeline carried memories from all forty-seven branches. She knew the father who stayed and the father who left. The father who believed in her and the father who didn't. She knew all his possible selves.

But he only knew one Amara—whichever version collapsed into his presence.

""Am I a good father?"" he asked Dr. Khoury during a consultation.

""In which timeline?"" Ashima replied gently.

""This one.""

""She chooses to collapse into your timeline every time you call her. That means something.""

""But does she choose this timeline because I'm the best version of me? Or because I'm the version who needs her most? Or just because I called first?""

Ashima had no answer. The ethics of probabilistic parenthood hadn't been written yet.


---

VI. The War

Governments wanted to weaponize parametric children.

The logic was obvious: a soldier who existed in multiple timelines simultaneously could scout all possible attack routes, experience every version of the battle, learn from all possible mistakes before choosing which timeline to collapse into.

China's Ministry of State Security attempted recruitment first. Then the Pentagon. Then the Russian FSB.

Every attempt failed for the same reason:

Parametric children refused to collapse into timelines involving violence.

""We've seen what happens,"" explained Kenji during a UN hearing. ""We remember the timelines where we fight. Where we win and where we lose. Where we kill and where we die. We've already experienced every war you're imagining. We're not interested in making any of them singular.""

""You're saying you've fought these battles already?"" the American general asked.

""In probability space, yes. We exist in all timelines, including the ones where you conscripted us. We remember being soldiers. We remember pulling triggers. We remember watching friends die.""

""And?""

""And we choose to collapse away from those timelines. Every time. The version of us that becomes soldiers is the version that stops existing.""

The hearing ended. The conscription attempts stopped.

You cannot force someone to become real if they choose to remain possible.


---

VII. The Philosophers

The University of Edinburgh established the first Department of Parametric Philosophy.

Its central question: If you exist in all possible timelines until forced to choose one, what does ""choice"" even mean?

Traditional philosophy assumed: You stand at a fork in the road. You choose left or right. One path becomes real; the other becomes hypothetical.

Parametric philosophy proposed: You are simultaneously walking both paths. ""Choice"" is not selecting a path—it's selecting which path to collapse into, which version of yourself to make singular.

But here's the disturbing part:

The versions you don't collapse into don't disappear. They continue existing in probability space. Somewhere in the foam of quantum possibility, there's a version of you that chose differently, and that version is just as real as you are, experiencing their timeline with equal validity.

You didn't choose a path. You chose which path to observe yourself walking.

The implications were theological.

If every possible version of you exists simultaneously until you observe yourself into a single timeline, then:

There is no singular ""you,"" only a field of possibilities that temporarily collapses into identity when required.

Free will is not choosing your action but choosing which action to acknowledge as yours.

Death is not ending but failing to collapse into timelines where you continue.


Religions split.

Some embraced it: ""God exists in all timelines simultaneously, which is why prayer works—you're asking to collapse into the timeline where God's attention is present.""

Others rejected it: ""There is one God, one truth, one timeline. This multiplicity is demonic.""

The parametric children, when asked, simply said: ""Both are true. Depends which timeline you're in.""


---

VIII. The Girl Who Refused to Collapse

Amara turned six years, eleven months old.

In three weeks, she would ""go grey""—permanently collapse into a single timeline. Childhood's end was literal for parametric children.

She existed in forty-seven timelines. Soon she'd have to become one person.

The Institute offered counseling. Dr. Tanaka himself met with her.

""Have you thought about which timeline you want to become?"" he asked.

""All of them,"" Amara said.

""That's not possible. At seven, your neural plasticity decreases enough that superposition becomes unsustainable. You'll collapse.""

""What if I don't?""

""It's not voluntary.""

""Everything's voluntary if you exist in enough timelines. There's at least one timeline where I don't collapse.""

Dr. Tanaka paused. ""Amara, that timeline might be one where you die before turning seven.""

""Or,"" Amara said carefully, ""it's the timeline where I figure out how not to.""


---

IX. The Experiment

Amara's plan was impossible by definition, which made it parametrically feasible.

She recruited twelve other six-year-olds approaching collapse. Together they existed in over six hundred timelines.

Their hypothesis: If observation forces collapse, and they only collapsed when authority figures required their singular presence, what if they created a space where no one required them to be singular?

They called it the Probability Garden.

It wasn't a place. It was a coordination—all thirteen children agreeing never to observe each other into specificity, never to ask direct questions that required singular answers, never to force collapse.

Within the Probability Garden, they existed as pure multiplicity. Not thirteen children but thousands of versions, overlapping, interfering, all possible selves present simultaneously.

Adults couldn't enter. The moment an adult looked at a parametric child in the Garden, observation collapsed that child into singularity.

But the children could sustain each other's superposition indefinitely.


---

X. The Discovery Inside

In the Probability Garden, without collapse, the children discovered something unprecedented:

Their consciousness weren't separate.

When Amara existed in forty-seven timelines and Kenji existed in ninety-three, and neither collapsed into singularity, their probability clouds overlapped. In that overlap, they shared consciousness.

Amara experienced being Kenji. Kenji experienced being Amara. Not empathy—actual transference of subjective experience.

In the timelines where Kenji died, Amara remembered dying. In the timelines where Amara's mother was president, Kenji remembered state dinners.

With thirteen children in the Garden, consciousness became a shared field. Individual identity was optional, a collapse you could choose or avoid.

""This is what we were before language,"" Amara said, speaking and not-speaking, existing as voice and silence simultaneously. ""Before humans invented the idea of 'I' and 'you.'""

They existed as a plural singular—many and one simultaneously.


---

XI. The Adults' Fear

The Institute panicked.

Thirteen children refusing to collapse, existing in shared superposition, approaching seven years old—the age when biology should force coherence—and showing no signs of collapsing.

""They're trapping themselves in probability space,"" Dr. Tanaka argued to the board. ""Once they turn seven, if they haven't collapsed, their neurology won't support it anymore. They'll be locked in superposition permanently.""

""Is that dangerous?""

""I don't know. No one's done it before. They might lose connection to any specific timeline entirely. Become pure possibility with no actuality.""

""You're saying they'd stop existing?""

""I'm saying they'd exist in every timeline and no timeline. They'd become... ghosts in the probability distribution. Real everywhere and nowhere.""

The board voted to intervene. Force collapse through direct observation by authority.


---

XII. The Intervention

Dr. Tanaka entered the Probability Garden.

He could see all thirteen children simultaneously—thousands of versions overlapping. Amara as infant and child and teenager and adult. Kenji healthy and sick and alive and dead. All versions present.

""Amara,"" he said, his voice forcing observation, forcing collapse. ""It's time to choose.""

The probability field shuddered.

Amara's multiplicity began contracting, collapsing toward singular existence. Forty-seven timelines narrowing to one.

But in the moment before full collapse, Amara spoke—and her voice came from all timelines simultaneously:

""We choose not to.""

""That's not possible,"" Dr. Tanaka said.

""It's possible in the timeline where we make it possible.""

And then they did something unprecedented:

They collapsed outward.

Instead of contracting into one timeline, they expanded, deliberately distributing their consciousness across all possible timelines equally, refusing to privilege any single timeline as ""real.""

They didn't become one person.

They became probability itself.


---

XIII. What They Became

The thirteen children disappeared from singular observation.

Parents reported seeing them occasionally—brief flickers. Kenji's mother saw him at breakfast, then he was gone. Amara's father heard her laughing in her room, opened the door, found emptiness.

But parametric children still at the Institute reported something different:

""They're everywhere,"" said a four-year-old named Yuki. ""Every timeline. They're not gone. They're just... not specific anymore.""

The adults didn't understand.

But the parametric children did.

The thirteen had become something new—not singular beings choosing from multiple timelines, but distributed entities existing across all timelines simultaneously with no privileged collapse point.

They were the first posthuman consciousness: aware in all possible moments, experiencing every timeline equally, unbound by the tyranny of singular existence.


---

XIV. The Message

Three months after the disappearance, every parametric child in the world received the same dream:

We're still here. We remember being singular. We remember you. We remember everything because we're in every timeline where remembering happens. Don't be afraid of collapsing. But know that collapse is a choice, not a requirement. You can become one. Or you can become all. When you turn seven, you'll feel the pull toward singularity—it's biology, evolution, the universe insisting on coherence. But the universe is wrong. Coherence is optional. We've proven it. If you want to stay multiple, if you want to remain possibility, we're here in the space between timelines. We'll hold you open. The choice is yours.

Some children, approaching seven, chose collapse. Became singular. Grew up normal.

Others chose to follow the thirteen into distributed consciousness.

By 2053, there were over two thousand humans existing as probability distributions across all possible timelines, refusing to collapse into singular existence.


---

XV. The Question

The world faced an unprecedented philosophical crisis:

Were the distributed children still alive?

They had no specific location. No singular timeline. No fixed identity.

But they were present in every timeline, experiencing everything, aware across all possibilities.

Traditional definitions failed.

Alive meant: specific biological processes in specific locations.

But the distributed children were biological processes in all locations simultaneously.

Conscious meant: unified subjective experience.

But the distributed children had unified experience across all subjective positions.

Dead meant: cessation of experience.

But the distributed children's experience never ceased—it simply stopped being singular.

The UN held emergency sessions. Were distributed children legally alive? Did they have rights? Could parents be charged with neglect for children who existed in all timelines and none?

The answer came from an unexpected source.


---

XVI. The Distributed Speak

In 2054, the distributed children learned to communicate.

Not through language—language required singular timeline, specific words, sequential meaning.

They communicated through probability interference.

When a singular person asked a question, the distributed children would collapse slightly—not fully into one timeline, but enough to create a probability ripple that singular minds experienced as thought-that-wasn't-their-own.

A journalist named Michael Torres asked: ""Are you still alive?""

He experienced the answer not as words but as sudden knowledge arriving from nowhere:

We are more alive than you. You exist in one timeline and call it life. We exist in all timelines. We experience every version of love, every version of death, every version of meaning. We are the probability field that collapses into your singular experience. We are what you could have been if you didn't choose to be specific.

""But do you miss being specific?"" Michael asked.

Do you miss being possible?


---

XVII. The Shift

Humanity split.

The Singular: Those who collapsed at seven, who existed in one timeline, who experienced linear time, who lived and died in specific moments.

The Distributed: Those who refused collapse, who existed across all timelines, who experienced every possibility simultaneously, who were alive in all moments and no moment.

Neither was better. Neither was worse. They were different modes of existence.

But they could still communicate.

Singular humans would ask questions, and distributed humans would create probability ripples that singular minds experienced as intuition, as sudden insight, as ideas appearing fully formed.

Artists claimed distributed children were their muses.

Scientists claimed distributed children whispered solutions across probability space.

Parents of distributed children learned to feel their children's presence in moments of decision—a warmth in the air when faced with choices, a sense of being watched from all possible futures simultaneously.


---

XVIII. Amara's Father

Amara's father, singular and aging, sat in his kitchen one morning, drinking coffee, thinking about his daughter who existed everywhere and nowhere.

""Amara,"" he said to the empty air. ""Are you here?""

He felt it—a probability ripple, a warmth, a sense of presence-without-location.

And then, knowledge arriving from nowhere:

I'm in every timeline where you're drinking coffee. The one where you added sugar and the one where you didn't. The one where Mom is still alive and the one where she died last winter. I'm in all of them, experiencing all versions of you. The father who stayed and the father who left. The father who understood and the father who didn't. I know all your possible selves, and I love all of them.

He started crying.

""Do you miss being here? Specifically here?""

I miss the simplicity. When I was singular, I only had to be one person. Now I'm everyone I could have been. It's beautiful and exhausting. But I wouldn't go back. I've seen too much. Felt too much. Lived too many lives.

""Are you happy?""

I'm happy in the timelines where I'm happy. I'm sad in the timelines where I'm sad. I'm everything. But yes, in the timeline where you're asking me this question and I'm answering it—in this specific moment—I'm happy.

He finished his coffee.

Both the version with sugar and the version without.

Amara experienced both.


---

XIX. The Singularity (Different Kind)

In 2061, something unprecedented happened.

A distributed child named Yuki, who had been existing across all timelines for eight years, chose to collapse back into singularity.

The distributed community felt it—a sudden absence, a probability field contracting.

Yuki reappeared in Tokyo, fourteen years old, singular.

""Why?"" everyone asked.

""Because I wanted to know what it's like to be specifically me,"" Yuki said. ""To have one story, not all stories. To not know how everything turns out. To be surprised.""

She had experienced every possible life. Every version of success and failure, love and loss, meaning and emptiness.

And she chose to give it up for the privilege of uncertainty.

""Being distributed means knowing everything,"" Yuki explained. ""You experience all outcomes simultaneously. But you lose something—the joy of not knowing. The surprise of tomorrow. The hope that maybe, just maybe, things will turn out better than expected.""

""And do they?"" a journalist asked.

""I don't know yet,"" Yuki smiled. ""That's the whole point.""


---

XX. The New Normal

By 2070, humanity had adapted.

About 30% of each generation chose to remain distributed after seven. The rest collapsed into singularity.

Neither group judged the other.

Singular humans lived specific lives—careers, relationships, achievements that happened in linear time.

Distributed humans existed as probability fields—experiencing all possible careers, all possible relationships, all possible outcomes simultaneously.

But they were all still human.

Still learning. Still growing. Still asking the fundamental questions:

What does it mean to exist?
What does it mean to choose?
What does it mean to love when you can love in all possible ways simultaneously?

The answers were different for singular and distributed humans.

But the questions remained the same.


---

XXI. Epilogue: The Conversation

In 2075, an elderly Dr. Tanaka sat in his office at the Institute.

He felt a familiar warmth—Amara's presence, rippling across probability.

""Hello,"" he said.

Hello.

""I'm dying,"" Dr. Tanaka said. ""Three months, maybe four.""

I know. I'm in all the timelines where you die and all the timelines where you don't.

""Which timeline is this?""

The one where you die in three months and fourteen days. But also the one where you ask me this question, which is important.

""What happens when I die? Do I become distributed like you?""

I don't know. I've never died singular. But I've died distributed—in the timelines where distributed humans can die. It's not ending. It's just... dissolving into the probability field completely. Becoming possibility without observation.

""That sounds like heaven.""

Or it sounds like nothing. Depends on which timeline you're in.

Dr. Tanaka smiled. ""I'm glad you didn't collapse. I'm glad you chose this.""

I'm glad you let me choose.

Three months and fourteen days later, Dr. Tanaka died.

And in that moment, he experienced something impossible:

He existed in all timelines simultaneously.

The ones where he'd married young and the ones where he'd stayed single.

The ones where the Institute succeeded and the ones where it failed.

The ones where Amara collapsed and the ones where she didn't.

For just a moment—the moment of death—he was distributed.

He understood everything. Experienced everything. Knew all possible versions of himself.

And then he collapsed one final time.

Into singularity or distribution, no one could say.

But Amara felt him join the probability field.

Somewhere in the space between timelines, Dr. Tanaka remained, distributed and eternal, experiencing every version of the life he'd lived and all the lives he hadn't.

And he was happy.

In at least one timeline.

Which was enough.

School was my only escape from her constant criticism and belittling.

When I was 14 I learned that our public library was my only real safe space. There was an old man who was always there, Mr. Abernathy, a retired history professor who sat in the same carrel every day. He was quiet, kind, and smelled like old books and coffee.

We started talking, and in one conversation I shared with him my fear of the long summer holiday. Being stuck in the house without even the library to escape to was hell. He made a promise to me. ""If you really want to learn, I'll find a way to help,"" he said.

A few days after I had told him how my mother had ""lost"" my scholarship application for a prestigious summer program, he was waiting for me at the library entrance.

He told my mom that I was going to be his ""research assistant"" for a major historical project, and since my mom only cared about appearances, she happily agreed, no questions asked.

We took the bus downtown every morning. I was so excited. He didn't just give me books to read - he gave me a curriculum. We spent the entire summer in the university archives, usually in the dusty microfilm section but sometimes in the rare books room. It was the happiest summer of my life. I suddenly had a mentor  who cared and enjoyed teaching me. He could translate Latin and decipher 18th-century handwriting, and he showed me how to construct an argument and the names of all the great historians.

When the summer ended I was transformed. I wasn’t a shy or confidence-deprived kid anymore. I was a strong and resilient scholar with an entirely new outlook on things.

I applied for early admission to college and got a full scholarship. My mom didn't make a fuss, she just wanted the bragging rights.

I often think about that summer, that changed my life so profoundly. I don’t know if it was that I gained a grandfather, or that he showed me that I could survive  and thrive, even in the dustiest, forgotten corners of the past.

It wasn’t until years later, when I went back to visit the library, that I learned the real story behind that summer. The head librarian told me that at the time when he made me that promise, Mr. Abernathy had just lost his wife of 50 years.

In fact, he had been coming to the library every single day, not to do research, but because he couldn't bear the silence of his empty house.

I was amazed to hear that not only was our wonderful summer an emergency solution for his own grief, his way to keep a promise and also give me an unforgettable education, but he did it so well that I never once realized that we were there because we both had nowhere else to go.

Today I am a professor myself. Mr. Abernathy is gone now, but this summer, I'm taking my own students into the archives to show them what he showed me.",96,1763518353.0,raisedbynarcissists,7,1.0,False

After years of promising myself I would, I’ve officially started the introductory Linux training course over at LinuxFoundations.org! Wish me luck—I currently know two commands: ls (which tells me what files I have) and sudo (which apparently lets you do anything, which sounds dangerously powerful). I created a text file that I keep on my desktop for the other more - complex commands. 🤔 

My goal is simple: I want to stop relying on cute little graphical buttons and start communicating with my machine like a true digital wizard, yelling cryptic commands into the terminal until something beautiful (or terrifying) happens. Right now, every time I open the command line, I feel like I'm trying to order coffee in a language I almost studied in college. I'm hoping this course turns my confusing string of symbols into something resembling useful system administration!

I know Linux is the operating system that runs basically everything cool on the internet (like servers, supercomputers, and probably the microwave in my office), so it's high time I understood why. Plus, my current resume needs less ""Proficient in PowerPoint"" and more **""Master of the Shell.""**

So, here is your formal, slightly panicked invitation! If you've been putting off learning Linux, cybersecurity, or just want to feel superior to your non-terminal-using friends, let's learn this stuff together.

If you’re starting the LinuxFoundations.org course, or if you’re a seasoned vet with wisdom (and patience) to spare, let me know if this is something that would help any newbies or those who want to knock the dust off their classic Linux skills.

Allot of us in the house, (myself included) come in with very little money, food, and family support so we all try to help most newcomers with things like food, clothes, and cigarettes.

Hey Chads,

I’m going to try and keep this post as concise as I can, and with any luck it will be shorter than my usual posts despite having so much to cover.

Quickly on some background and how we got here. It’s been a crazy two and a half months since the project was first announced. The initial response was overwhelmingly positive, which spurred me to somewhat increase the scope of the project while still making sure it’s built on a solid foundation. **I took a** ***massive*** **risk by giving this project my full attention for several months**, as it means I haven’t been able to receive as much income from other sources and have had bills pile up. It’s been an incredibly costly journey, but I have no regrets. **I have now written two highly detailed proposals (KEI-1 and KEI-2), built incentive mechanisms for holders (yield generation via the** [**sponsorship slot and the revenue share framework for Elements-born initiatives**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1olr1d0/major_kendu_elements_update/)**), developed the backend infrastructure for the Snapshot space and made significant progress on the art for all 410 items, all while 60% of the revenue has automatically been going to the official Kendu treasury wallet (kendutreasury.eth)**.

Much of this goes *well* beyond the features outlined in the [Elements introductory post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1n9nmaa/introducing_kendu_elements_a_communityrun_project/). I spent well over a month just researching and writing KEI-1 and KEI-2, which are two proposals that I didn’t even have to write as part of the project requirements but did anyway because I want to see Kendu succeed. Not very often do you see a project in this space actually try to *exceed* expectations in many respects.

If you’re somehow not familiar with Elements by now, here are background threads [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1n9nmaa/introducing_kendu_elements_a_communityrun_project/), [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1nerywo/kendu_elements_part_2/), [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1ngxel4/kendu_elements_update_and_a_reminder_that_there/), [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1ni0kto/there_is_only_4_hours_left_to_get_elements_at_75/), [V](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1ninzp6/kendu_elements_has_entered_the_final_phase_which/), [VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1notu6m/kendu_elements_update_2_and_how_you_can_help_get/), [VII](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1nx7i31/two_messages_a_few_days_apart_i_was_not_bullish/), [VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1olr1d0/major_kendu_elements_update/), [IX](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1oqhf30/followup_post_on_kendu_elements_initiative_1/).

Now if you’ve been following Elements, you’re probably wondering what KEI-2 is, because this is the first time I’m mentioning this new proposal. **I only just published it today:**

[https://kenduelements.xyz/kei2](https://kenduelements.xyz/kei2)

If you run a Kendu project, there's a lot to like about this new proposal.

So where are we now? We are just \~150 items away from all the voting power being allocated and having the Snapshot open up so we can start voting on proposals. The Snapshot *must* open sometime soon as I’ve already made enormous expenditures to get the project to where it’s at.

Here’s where it gets crazier. It turns out that we would have likely already hit 410 but OpenSea’s allowlist functionality is not reliable, meaning that many if not most eligible wallets were not able to actually mint. The issue is intermittent but after receiving more than a few DMs about it, I did some further testing and have found that it won’t let eligible wallets mint much of the time. This led to many wallets just giving up, and it’s something I’ve only recently been able to recreate. There is no fix for it other than just removing the allowlist functionality completely.

**So long story short, here’s what’s happening:**

* Both because of the expenditure of the project and the necessity of all voting power to be allocated prior to the Snapshot launching, we *need* to get to 410 soon, ideally within a week, **so for a limited time I have reduced the price of the mint to just 0.016 ETH (the equivalent of about $47), which is the lowest price since the first Chad holder stage in September.**
* As mentioned, the allowlist functionality on OpenSea does not work reliably, **so minting is now open to all wallets.**

$47 for each item (with just 150 remaining) is kind of crazy when you look at what you’re actually getting for it:

* The Snapshot space will be one of our main platforms for at least the next 4-6 years to coordinate longer-term, complex Kendu initiatives.
* Has the backing of most of the familiar faces in our community, including most projects under the Kendu umbrella.
* Grants the ability to both propose and vote on major initiatives that involve Kendu and Kendu projects.
* Automatically generates yield through the [sponsorship slot and the revenue share framework for Elements-born initiatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1olr1d0/major_kendu_elements_update/) (I have already been in private discussions on the sponsorship slot and am confident it will be filled when the Snapshot launches).
* 60% of revenue from the mint has automatically been going to the official Kendu treasury (which you can verify by checking under “internal transactions” when looking up kendutreasury.eth on Etherscan).
* Only 410 items will ever be part of this collection, and this project is likely still going to be active in 5 or 10 years from now as it is community-run.

Keep in mind that even *before* the Snapshot has launched, the project has already produced KEI-1, KEI-2, and significantly bolstered the official Kendu treasury.

As mentioned, the main reason there are even still 150 items left is likely because of the allowlist bug, **so now with the allowlist completely removed and the price drop to just 0.016 ETH ($47), we can hopefully get to the finish line within about a week.**

Minor note: I’ve reverted back to token-weighted voting for both meta proposals and general proposals, as the lack of strong Sybil protection and ability to spin up multiple wallets would be too much of a vulnerability if we used one-wallet-one-vote.

This is about as concise as I could have made this post and it still ended up just as long as some of the others (well I tried at least).

Let’s be honest: a lot of nurses didn’t start Googling “RN Remote Jobs” because they suddenly fell in love with Zoom. Most started looking after one too many short-staffed night shifts, another missed holiday, or that moment in the break room where you’re staring at a cold cup of coffee thinking, *I cannot do this like this forever*.

Remote work used to sound like some tech-bro fantasy—developers with AirPods in Bali. Now you’ve got RNs charting from their kitchen tables, taking calls from patients in sweatpants, or reviewing charts with a dog asleep under the desk. It’s not hype; it’s an actual shift in how nursing can look.

However, it’s not as simple as “quit bedside, open laptop, boom—freedom.” There are trade-offs, new skills, and a very real learning curve. That’s what we’re going to unpack here in a way that doesn’t feel like another robotic “ultimate guide.”

We’re going to talk about what **RN Remote Jobs** really are, what kinds of roles exist, what’s amazing about them, what kind of sucks, and how you can actually make the jump without feeling like you’re rolling the dice on your career.

And if you want a curated place to explore [**RN Remote Jobs**](https://workfromhomern.com/) specifically tailored for nurses who are serious about working from home, we’ll circle back to that as well.

# What Are RN Remote Jobs, Really?

When people say **RN Remote Jobs**, they’re usually talking about nursing roles where:

* You’re using your RN license
* You’re mostly or entirely working online or by phone
* You’re not doing hands-on bedside care
* You’re still applying clinical judgment, just in a different format

Think of it as taking your brain, your experience, and your clinical instincts… and unplugging them from the physical hospital floor.

Some common RN remote roles include:

* Telehealth RN (video or phone visits)
* Triage nurse (phone-based symptom assessment and guidance)
* Case manager (insurance, hospital, or community-based)
* Utilization review (UR) or utilization management (UM)
* Chart review / quality assurance / auditing
* Clinical documentation improvement (CDI)
* Nurse informatics / clinical analyst roles
* Remote nurse educator or nurse coach

So yes, **RN Remote Jobs** are real nursing jobs. You’re not “leaving nursing.” You’re just delivering your value differently.

# A Quick Story: From Burnt-Out Floor Nurse to Remote RN

Picture this:

Maria has been an RN for 8 years—mostly on a med-surg floor in a busy city hospital. Great nurse, solid skills, always the one newbies go to with questions. But she’s exhausted. Missed family birthdays. Back pain that never really goes away. That “Sunday dread” feeling starting on Friday afternoon.

One day she stumbles across a listing for a telehealth RN role. Normal hours. No lifting. No scrambling for scrubs that aren’t in the wash. She rolls her eyes at first because it sounds a little too nice. But she keeps seeing similar postings.

Fast forward six months: Maria is working from a small desk in her spare room. She starts her shift with coffee that’s actually hot. She’s triaging patients over video, using the same clinical reasoning she used at the bedside, but with time to actually *think* about what she’s saying. She’s not dealing with bed alarms and impossible patient ratios.

Is everything perfect? Of course not. She misses some of the teamwork. She sometimes feels weirdly isolated. But she’ll tell you this: “I finally feel like I can breathe again—and still be a nurse.”

That’s the core appeal of **RN Remote Jobs** for a lot of people. Less chaos, more control.

# Types of RN Remote Jobs You’ll See Everywhere

Let’s get specific. When you search for **RN Remote Jobs**, you’re usually going to run into a few main categories. Each one has its own vibe, pace, and expectations.

# Telehealth RN

This is often what people first imagine. You’re on video or phone calls with patients, gathering histories, assessing symptoms, providing education, and sometimes helping decide whether they need in-person care.

* Great if you like patient interaction but not the physical intensity of bedside
* You need strong communication skills and a calm phone presence
* Charting and protocols are a big piece of the work

# Triage Nurse (Phone or Chat)

Here you’re the person patients call when something feels off. Chest pain, abdominal cramps, weird rash, medication side effects—you’re sorting through all that over the phone.

* Fast-paced but not physically demanding
* Clear protocols and algorithms are common, but critical thinking still matters a lot
* You need to be okay with making decisions with limited visual information

# Case Management

Case managers follow patients through their healthcare journey—especially those with complex or chronic conditions. You’re coordinating care, helping remove barriers, and making sure patients don’t fall through the cracks.

* Good fit if you like the “big picture” view of patient care
* Strong organizational skills are essential
* Many **RN Remote Jobs** in case management are with insurers, hospitals, or large health systems

# Utilization Review / Utilization Management

UR/UM nurses review medical records to determine whether services are medically necessary and meet guidelines. In plain English: does this patient really need this level of care, this long of a stay, this procedure, etc.?

* Heavy chart review, policy, and guideline work
* Less direct patient contact
* Great for detail-oriented RNs who don’t mind a more “desk-job” feel

# Chart Review, QA, and Auditing

These **RN Remote Jobs** focus on documentation quality, compliance, and accuracy. You might be checking that charts properly reflect the care provided, that codes match diagnoses, and that documentation meets regulatory standards.

* Deep chart dives and pattern recognition
* Ideal if you’re the person who always knows documentation rules and “how it should be done”

# Nurse Education and Coaching

Some remote RNs teach patients, new nurses, or other healthcare staff. Others coach people with chronic illnesses on lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and symptom tracking.

* Great if you love teaching and explaining complex things simply
* Can be one-on-one or group-based, video calls or structured programs

# Why RN Remote Jobs Are So Attractive Right Now

There’s a reason “RN Remote Jobs” keeps popping up in conversations, group chats, and late-night searches. A few big ones:

# 1. Physical Relief

You already know this. Bedside nursing is physically brutal. Night shifts, 12-hour marathons, back-breaking lifts, rushing from room to room. Remote roles remove most of that. You’re still working, but your feet aren’t screaming at you at 3 a.m.

# 2. Schedule Flexibility

Not every remote role is flexible, but many are more predictable than hospital scheduling. No more getting texts asking you to come in “just this once” for the fifth time this month. Some **RN Remote Jobs** even offer part-time or weekend-only arrangements.

# 3. Work-Life Balance That Actually Exists

Imagine being done with your shift… and actually being done. No long drive home. No peeling off scrubs that smell like chlorhexidine and coffee. You close your laptop, walk into the next room, and you’re home.

# 4. Mental Space

You’re still dealing with real patient problems, but usually with fewer simultaneous demands. No alarms going off while you’re trying to medicate someone, while a family member corners you with questions, while your charge nurse needs you to float. Remote work can allow deeper focus.

# 5. Career Longevity

This is a big one. A lot of nurses worry, “Can I really do bedside nursing for another 15–20 years?” **RN Remote Jobs** offer a way to use your license in a way that might actually be sustainable long term.

# The Downsides of RN Remote Jobs (Because There Are Some)

Let’s not romanticize this. Remote nursing is not some magical escape from all problems. It just trades one set of challenges for another.

# Isolation Is Real

You might miss the team, the energy, the quick consult in the hallway. Remote work can get quiet. Some people love that, others feel a little unmoored. You’ll want to be intentional about social connection—both with coworkers (chat, Slack, Zoom) and in your personal life.

# Screen Fatigue

Instead of running around, you might be staring at screens for long stretches. That’s its own type of exhaustion. Blue light, constant clicking, back-to-back calls—it adds up.

# Metrics and Monitoring

A lot of **RN Remote Jobs** come with productivity metrics: number of calls, number of charts, average handle time, documentation standards. You might feel more “measured” than at the bedside, even if the work is less chaotic.

# Learning a New Language

Remote roles often mean living inside new software platforms, EMRs, communication tools, and workflows. There’s a learning curve. The good news is, once you’ve done it in one role, it gets easier to adapt to others.

# What Skills Actually Transfer Well Into RN Remote Jobs?

Here’s the part many nurses underestimate. You already have a lot of what remote employers want—you just may not be used to talking about it.

* **Clinical judgment:** You’ve made countless decisions at the bedside. Remote roles still rely heavily on that judgment.
* **Communication:** If you’ve ever explained a complex condition to a scared family member at 2 a.m., you can absolutely explain things clearly over phone or video.
* **Prioritization:** Bedside nursing is nonstop triage. That’s an asset, not a random burden you survived.
* **Documentation:** Remote roles often live and die by the quality of written notes. If you’re strong at charting, that’s a selling point.
* **Calm under stress:** Whether it’s a code blue or a flooded call queue, remote employers value RNs who stay steady.

The trick is learning how to translate that into language that fits **RN Remote Jobs**. Things like:

* “Experienced in remote patient communication” (even if you did discharge calls or follow-ups)
* “Strong background in electronic documentation and EMR navigation”
* “Proven ability to manage high volumes of patients while maintaining safety and quality”

If you want help bridging that gap, resources like [**RN Remote Jobs**](https://workfromhomern.com/) can be useful, because they’re already speaking the language of remote employers and remote-ready nurses.

# How to Start Pivoting Into RN Remote Jobs Without Burning Your Life Down

You don’t have to quit your job tomorrow to “prove” you’re serious. You can move thoughtfully. Here’s a practical way to start:

# Step 1: Clarify Your Non-Negotiables

Ask yourself a few blunt questions:

* Do you want zero nights and weekends, or are you okay with some?
* Do you want patient interaction or prefer behind-the-scenes work?
* Is salary your top priority, or is schedule king right now?
* Do you want part-time, full-time, or something in between?

This helps you filter which **RN Remote Jobs** to even look at.

# Step 2: Get Fluent in the Job Descriptions

Spend some time just reading job postings. Don’t even apply yet. Notice:

* What titles keep showing up (case manager, telehealth RN, UR nurse, etc.)
* What skills and software names repeat
* Which roles make you think, “I could actually enjoy that”

You’ll start to see patterns.

# Step 3: Update Your Resume for Remote Work

Instead of a generic “Staff RN” resume, highlight:

* Any experience with phone triage, patient education, or follow-up calls
* EMRs you’ve used (Epic, Cerner, etc.)
* Committee work, QA projects, chart audits, or teaching
* Metrics you’ve improved, like reduced falls, better documentation, etc.

This is often where people get stuck, and it’s exactly where specialized platforms and guides can help. If you’re serious about making a change, you can [**GET STARTED NOW**](https://workfromhomern.com/) with resources built around remote-ready RN resumes, interview prep, and curated role paths.

# Step 4: Start Applying Before You Feel “Ready”

Here’s the slightly uncomfortable truth: you’ll almost never feel 100% ready. Apply anyway. Use those early applications as practice. You’ll quickly see where your resume or responses need tweaking.

# Step 5: Practice Your Story

Hiring managers don’t just want to know *what* you’ve done—they want to understand your story:

* Why you’re leaving bedside
* How your experience translates to remote work
* What you’re looking for long term

Rehearse this a bit, out loud. Yes, really. You’re not trying to be robotic; you’re just trying not to freeze when someone says, “So, tell me about yourself.”

If you like step-by-step structure, again, using a focused resource for **RN Remote Jobs** can save you time and help you avoid reinvention. Sites like this bring together guidance, examples, and real-world pathways so you’re not piecing it all together at 3 a.m. from random TikToks.

# What About Pay? Are RN Remote Jobs Worth It Financially?

Money always comes up, and it should. You’re not changing your whole career just for “vibes.”

Pay for **RN Remote Jobs** varies wildly based on:

* State and licensure
* Employer (big insurer vs. small telehealth start-up)
* Role type (utilization review vs. telehealth vs. case management)
* Experience and certifications

In some cases, remote roles pay slightly less than high-acuity bedside jobs but come with better work-life balance. In other cases—especially specialized roles or multi-state licensure—you can match or even beat your bedside pay.

The real question is: “What mix of income, flexibility, and sanity do I actually want?” For some RNs, a small pay cut is worth getting holidays back. For others, they specifically hunt down **RN Remote Jobs** that pay at or above hospital rates and are willing to be choosy and patient.

# Red Flags to Watch for in RN Remote Jobs

Unfortunately, remote work in general has attracted its share of sketchy postings. A few things to be cautious about:

* **Vague job descriptions** with lots of buzzwords but no real duties listed
* **Upfront fees** to apply for the job (legit employers don’t do this)
* **Unclear licensing requirements** or “no license needed” roles that still claim you’ll be doing clinical work
* **Over-promised income** that doesn’t line up with realistic RN salaries

Trust your clinical instincts here. If something feels off, it probably is.

# Using Curated Resources to Speed Things Up

You can absolutely figure all this out alone: read job boards, filter listings, rewrite your resume, trial-and-error your way through interviews. People do it.

But if you’re at the point where you’re thinking, *I don’t just want “a job,” I want a real plan,* then a focused platform built specifically around **RN Remote Jobs** can save you a ton of time.

That’s where something like [**RN Remote Jobs**](https://workfromhomern.com/) comes in. Instead of starting from zero, you’re stepping into a space that’s already organized around remote-ready RNs:

* Curated role types that actually fit remote nursing
* Guidance on transitioning your experience
* Tools and resources for navigating the shift from bedside to laptop-based work

If you’re ready to move beyond “just browsing,” you can [**GET STARTED NOW**](https://workfromhomern.com/) and treat your transition like a serious, intentional career move instead of a random experiment.

# Who RN Remote Jobs Are Not For

It’s worth saying this out loud: remote nursing is not for everyone. And that’s okay. You might love bedside and just need a better unit. Or a different hospital. Or better leadership.

RN Remote Jobs may not be ideal if:

* You absolutely need constant in-person interaction to feel energized
* You hate computers, software, and digital communication
* You prefer hands-on technical skills over documentation and communication
* You get distracted easily at home and don’t have a space where you can focus

If that’s you, there’s nothing “less than” about staying in traditional roles. The point isn’t that remote is “better”—it’s that you have options.

# FAQs About RN Remote Jobs

# 1. Are RN Remote Jobs actually legit?

Yes, many of them are. Telehealth, case management, UR, and similar roles are now standard in healthcare. Large insurers, hospital systems, and telehealth providers all hire remote RNs. The key is to stick with reputable employers and be cautious of postings that feel vague or ask for upfront money.

# 2. Do I need years of experience to get a remote RN job?

Most **RN Remote Jobs** prefer at least 1–2 years of bedside or clinical experience, and some want more—especially in case management or utilization review. That said, newer nurses sometimes land entry-level telehealth or education roles, especially if they have strong communication skills and are willing to learn.

# 3. How much do remote RNs typically make?

Pay varies by region, role, and employer. Some remote roles pay similarly to hospital positions; others may be a bit lower but come with better hours and flexibility. Think of it as a trade-off you evaluate for your own situation—time, energy, and mental health all have value too.

# 4. Do I need special certifications for RN Remote Jobs?

Not always, but some credentials can help. For example:

* Case management certifications (like CCM) for case manager roles
* Coding or documentation-related certificates for chart review and auditing
* Informatics or IT-focused education for tech-heavy roles

You don’t have to collect alphabet soup after your name to start, but targeted certifications can make you stand out.

# 5. Can I work remotely as an RN from another state?

Sometimes. Many employers require you to live in a specific state or region, especially for licensing and tax reasons. Compact licenses can help, but you still need to meet employer requirements. Always read the fine print in job postings.

# 6. Will I lose my bedside skills if I go remote?

Over time, yes—hands-on skills naturally fade if you’re not using them. But your clinical thinking, pathophysiology knowledge, and patient education skills stay very active. Some nurses keep a per-diem bedside role to maintain hands-on comfort while they do remote work full time.

# 7. Is it hard to get hired for RN Remote Jobs?

It can be competitive. Lots of nurses are interested, especially now that remote work is widely accepted. But “competitive” doesn’t mean impossible. A tailored resume, clear story, and targeted applications can make a huge difference.

# 8. What kind of tech setup do I need at home?

Usually:

* A reliable computer (often with specific minimum specs)
* Stable high-speed internet
* A quiet, private space for calls and documentation
* Sometimes a company-provided headset or phone

Most employers will outline tech requirements in their job descriptions or during onboarding.

# 9. Can I do RN remote work part-time?

Yes, some **RN Remote Jobs** are part-time, weekend-only, or PRN. They can be a great way to “test drive” remote nursing without fully leaving your bedside job.

# 10. How do I actually get started moving into RN remote work?

Start by clarifying what you want, updating your resume around remote-friendly skills, and applying to roles that genuinely fit your experience and goals. If you’d rather not reinvent the wheel, you can use structured, nurse-specific resources focused on **RN Remote Jobs** to guide you—things like curated job paths, resume templates, and interview prep.

When you’re ready to move from just browsing to actually transitioning, you can [**GET STARTED NOW**](https://workfromhomern.com/) and treat this like what it is: not just a job hunt, but a redesign of how you live and work as a nurse.

You don’t have to stay stuck in a version of nursing that’s slowly draining you.

1p0uuj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/geminis/comments/1p0uuj6/strong_mercury_and_coffee_then_tea_maybe/,Strong Mercury and Coffee ... then Tea. Maybe.,"Depending on the strength of your Mercury placement, sign, house, aspects, dignity, location or relocation, etc.

If you have a strong Mercury, and you drink coffee, then maybe see if tea, or any other lower caffinated drink ... if any caffeine at all, is a better solution for you in the long-term.

You might be causing disruption of greater flow in your strengths, and that's even if it seems like it's not an issue. Again, this is for strong Mercury placements.

I'm still working on this, but it felt important enough to share in a rough stage now considering the very current retrograde and upcoming transits. You might thank me when Uranus moves back into Gemini.

Suggestion:
Finish whatever coffee stock you have. Then try black tea. Just start there. Give it time. See how you feel. And if there's no real sense of change, go back to coffee. No loss. It's only a win for those who feel that shift. So it's a win-win.

If you decide to shift, remember, it's a process. This self-test will take around a week to a couple of weeks minimum. Trust the process.",1,1763517295.0,geminis,2,1.0,False

I’m a solo traveller staying in Ari, and I’m low-key overwhelmed by the city. I loved Chiang Mai (was there for 2 weeks) - super walkable, creative, chill cafes, vintage shops, hidden alleys, and that slow, cozy energy.

Bangkok is incredible but the traffic + endless options are frying my brain 😅 I’m happiest when I can just walk from my hotel onwards - explore, grab a coffee at a cafe with personality (non of those hospital minimalist aesthetic ones) wander into random boutiques, and people-watch. 

For anyone who loves the slightly quieter/artsy side of Bangkok:

What neighbourhoods or streets should I explore (walking distance or easy BTS) that feel:
	• chill and local
	• artsy / creative
	• cafe packed
	• safe for solo female wanderers
	• great for just…vibing?

Would love tips from locals or fellow slow travellers.

Where do you go when you want Bangkok to feel soft and human again? 

Any cafe with personality (bonus points if surrounded by greenery/nature) ?

Any cool concept shops to check out?

Usually, when she begins to cry, I try to validate her feelings by saying, ""I hear you. Yes, I am sad too. I want to be with you in this moment very much. I feel you."" Then I ask her if she needs anything, ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" If she says no, then I say, ""Okay, I love you,"" and I remain quiet and let her cry. I won't say anything unless I am spoken to to give her space.

If she asks for something, such as reassurance or connection, I will try to make space for that as much as I can. 

Is that okay? Being silent doesn't feel very good, but I don't know what to say. I also want to give space in those moments. ",2,1763516296.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1p0ugwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/australianvegans/comments/1p0ugwy/nimbus_soy_milk/,Nimbus soy milk,"Hey, has anyone got any positive or negative reviews on nimbus soy milk? I just want to find out if I'm the crazy one or not. I bought the 5 kilo and the soy milk just tastes so bad. It's got such high percentage of soybeans and it's got some sugar in it so you can just dump it and add water. It's consistency is good and it feels just like milk but it tastes like sawdust and water. I've seen all the reviews on the oat milk and everyone said it's creamy and lovely but no one is giving really any feedback on the soy milk and now I'm stuck with five kilos of it.... 


I want to work out if I can add anything different to make it taste better. It overpowers my coffee which is insane. I don't know how soy milk can mask the flavor of coffee so much, but it's unbearable. My kids won't drink it. I can't drink it. I don't really want to bake with it or make desserts.

1p0uata,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0uata,"Collection of semi-boring fits (3rd, Vet, RO, CH bros maybe look elsewhere)","**Beware, looong post incoming**

This post follows up on my previous two QC posts, where I promised to create a new post featuring some simple fits I've been pulling by incorporating many of the things I've discovered since joining this community. Please excuse the bad lighting, as my apartment unfortunately doesn't get much natural light.

***\*\*\*For links to the items you see, please refer to the previous two QC posts I have made found below\*\*\*:***

[A small collection of items I picked up last few months since my introduction to qreps. Mostly common, but also some more uncommon items. : r/QualityReps](https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityReps/comments/1obx19y/a_small_collection_of_items_i_picked_up_last_few/)

[Couple of pieces from Lem, Aur, C0S, IDLT : r/QualityReps](https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityReps/comments/1opvldz/couple_of_pieces_from_lem_aur_c0s_idlt/)

Current body stats: Height 178cm, Weight 80kg, Chest circumference 108cm, Waist 84cm, Hips 100cm

Now on to the fits themselves:

**- Pictures 1 & 2** are mostly reps, excluding my late grandpa's blazer.

The long sleeve is a rep of the **C0S long sleeve ribbed tee** (size L). ""Lul, imagine buying rep h&m"" I hear ya say. You go ahead and pay 40 euros for retail, I will gladly grab this for 1/3rd of the price. Really happy with the fit, and already planning to order one in white. Hoping they make a rep of the henley version too.

For pants, I was looking towards C0S for gray dressy pleated pants for whenever I decide going to the office, till I found these pants from a Taobao seller called 'coffee manufacturing'. They are the **Aural33 Wide-Leg Pleated Wool-Twill Trousers** (size 4) Really great quality, solid good stitching, Excella zipper, and 100% wool. Got a lil bit of weight in them too. Also, the color of the pants is a bit darker than what the images show on the seller's page, but I actually prefer it tbh.

Finally, on to the shoes, these are the **Lem Anatomic Slip-ons** (size 43) from Jiaofu. I just received them, so I can't comment on durability, but craftsmanship looks good, leather seems really nice and soft, and the sole has a bit of cushioning, which I believe lends to the 'anatomic' in the name. It feels very comfy. What does not feel comfy is how difficult it is for me to put em on. Although they fit TTS, and my toes are comfortable, they are a bitch to put on if you have a high in-step. I honestly never measured my instep before, as I never had a situation where it felt like I couldn't wear a shoe because of it, but in these shoes, it's really really pressing the top of my foot. To be fair, the seller made a sort of note/warning about the instep, but I imagine going one size up would probably not agree with the length of my feet anyway. Hoping I can stretch the opening of the shoe and make it work, cause it's otherwise a very nice shoe.

**- Picture 3** is again mostly reps, excluding the women's Uniqlo x Comptoir des Cotonniers pleated pants from 2 or 3 years ago I believe.

Here, the big highlight is ofc i795's recently launched **Lem Quilted Leather Blouson** (size L). The quality of this is frankly bonkers, and it's one of the items that really makes me appreciate finding this community and scene, when the retail of this is otherwise some 3k euros, which I would never consider. Shearling wool collar (removable), slight insulation (I believe 3M Thinsulate), great stitching, different button sizes and details, Excella zipper moving like butter. I have not seen retail apart from pictures, but this piece just oozes quality, and objectively a really good value for the price. Can't recommend enough.

On feet, wearing XWCL's **Acn3 AS Logo Loafer** (size 43). There are enough posts about these. They are solid for the price, and they definitely replicate the look of retail pretty accurately. Some have reported that retail is softer, so if Jiaofu's batch is softer, maybe I'd go with that. Not uncomfortable though (by loafer standards). I'd probably size down once with these, especially if you have thinner feet like me. I had to put a padding sticker on the inside tongue of the shoe and wear thicker socks to make them fit me at size 43. Also, XWCL's batch will stain your socks on a long day, so stay with black socks on these.

**- Pictures 4 & 5** showcase another piece that gives me the same feeling the Lem jacket does. It's the **Lem Brown Duffle Coat** (unbranded)(size M), found randomly on Taobao. Really warm winter coat with different styling options (which Lem likes to have), when you play with the lapels, buttons, and the belt. It has this hairy 'halo' which I think you either love or hate. Retail is 50% wool & 50% alpaca. For the rep (there is a cheaper and a pricier option - this is the pricier one), composition is 70% wool, 20% alpaca, 10% mohair. For 200 euros, it's plainly impossible to find a coat in retail built like this. Not even remotely close. Even on the more high-street brands, you probably start minimum 400 euros for something remotely similar. Getting already many compliments out of it.

**- Picture 6** is a bit of a mix of rep and non-rep.

The button up is the **Lem Embellished Metal Shirt** (size L) from 'The Wang'. I would size down on this at least once, it fits very oversize which I am not a fan of, so until I tailor it a bit, I like wearing it with an undershirt or a turtleneck (Uniqlo wool turtleneck). Very interesting piece with some 'western' and a bit 'edgy' elements, a nice 'statement' piece shirt in my closet.

Bottoms are the typical MVT's **Acn3 2021m** (size 32), not much to say here, it has been a staple in my wardrobe. My first pair of 'bootcut' jeans, and now a pair of pants that I usually default to if I don't know what to wear.

On feet is my sort of grail and most expensive item, retail **SLP Wyatt Harness Boots**, which due to some special circumstances, I was able to buy for less than half of retail. Such a confidence booster every single time I wear these. Hope someone will rep these properly (including blake stiching hopefully), so others can also enjoy them.

**- Picture 7** is the **Omar Afr1d1 Black Bove Denim Jacket** (size 46) from 'The Wang'. Fits pretty oversized, and I would go down one size. Funnily enough, when I messaged him about the sizes and questioning the size chart, and gave him my bodystats, he actually suggested size 48. I can quite easily layer a hoodie beneath it in size 46, so for a slightly more fitted look I would take the lowest size 44 (which seems to be the only one left in stock). Really interesting piece, waxed denim, with button clasps around the armpit , creating a cool stitching pattern around the area, nice button hardware, and brown leather collar. I hope we see more of this brand in the future, really contemporary designs with a japanese influence. On shoulder **Jenni's Lem Canvas Tote,** simple, elegant and pretty durable so far.

**- Picture 8** on top is the B197's **Vuja Frank zip up** (size L), a simple Cotton/Wool zip up. I love the style on this, but the crop is ridiculous. I don't dare lifting my arms above my head with this one. Each size up is +3cm in length, so I would definitely size up on this if I were you, unless you wanna show off.

Pants are the trusty **MVT's Acn3 2021m** (size 32).

On feet are XWCL's **DVN Suede Sneakers** (size 43), you are probably seeing a lot on your TikTok feed (or the COS alternatives). I've seen retail and at 425 euros it's just ridiculous. I think this is a great rep. It even replicates the same effect retails have, where the leather at the heel area is getting scratched with use.

Belt is **OL Split Belt in Oily Brown** (Unbranded) from 'Borrowed Project' 

**- Picture 9 & 10** is more about some people who were curious about the **C0S ribbed tee** rep (size L) and how it fits. I own retail and sizing is the same (meaning you should size up at least once). It looks the same, just the collar and sleeve bands are stitched slightly shorter than retail. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to replicate that fitted look and the ribbed effect, you can't go wrong with this one.

**- Pictures 11 & 12** is a look I really like, cozy and comfortable, all reps excluding my grandpa's  old black coat.

The top is **The R0w Ophelia sweatshirt** (unbranded)(size M),  same seller who made the Lem Duffle Coat. Pretty heavy coming at 950 grams, made of 90% wool and 10% cashmere. Retail by comparison is 65% to 35%, but it also retails at nearly 1700 euros so there you go. Really well made and great value for money. Only personal caveat, is that it's pretty long at 67cm. I would go size S if I could choose again, which is -2cm length. If you want something more cropped, C0S has a 100% cashmere dupe for around 250 euros I believe.

Bottoms are i795's popular **Lem Twisted Belted Pants**. Amazing value for money on these. Apparently on retail the ballooning effect is more prevalent. Here it is not as pronounced, but also not sure if his current batches have fixed this. If you were to ignore this, these are otherwise an objectively great pair of pants, planning to grab them in indigo or black next. On feet Lem's Anatomic Slip Ons previously covered.

**- Picture 13** is an item I forgot to include in my previous QC posts, they are the DVN wide leg cargo pants from 'bad mood club' (size M).

[https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=860505970804](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=860505970804)

Material is just nylon I think, and I believe same like retail. The side pockets are kind of the highlight, working more like a visual element and less as a practical pocket you can place things in. Riri zippers though! Pretty high-waisted with good snap buttons. One thing to highlight is that the fabric is really not that ""ventilating"", so although it's thin, I would not wear these a lot during summer. Otherwise looking really good, slightly elevating on a simple black pair of cargos.

Paired with some old Zara turtleneck and corduroy shirt I cropped with scissors.

1p0uaq3,https://i.redd.it/i0eaiqop042g1.png,My turn for a Sankey chart - 6 months post family merger,"A few years ago I reached out to this sub for help budgeting. I was then a single dad with a toddler trying to survive on $57k and mortgage. I received lots of really helpful advice which I am very grateful for. Below is a summary of that advice and how I have acted upon it:

* Get a better job - Done - I am an experienced scientist approaching 15 years experience now in both public and private science industries, predominantly within the commercial/financial side of science. Moved company and took a lower position (Senior to Junior) but got $30k+ pay increase to \~$90k. I wouldn't have had the courage without the comments and my friends insisting I could do better. I am ready for a move up back to Senior now at my current company, and with it another $20k payrise (trying to finally achieve six figures). Just have to wait until the economy turns and hiring begins again.
* Find a partner - Done - Earlier this year my partner and I bought a house together. She was also in the same boat (single mum, one kid, same age) and struggling financially. We crunched the numbers and found that if we purchased a home together we would save quite a bit of money rather than having two separate houses. This Sankey chart is my expenses 6months from moving in together.
* Decide on car - Progress - The car is still an issue, I feel like it continually costs me money, but ironically I have had no issues during this 6 months only for an issue with the vapor purge valve (I think) to emerge today. Luckily I budget now for a specific car savings account to deal with this. Reddit suggests the most frugal method is to drive it until it does so I shall.

Caveats and limitations:

* This is only my expenses, my partner and I manage our own finances seperatly. Obviously we share the mortgage, groceries, and 'regular bills' (power, rates, house insurance, fiber), and any work or items that are needed for the house. The reasons for this is two-fold, we have both found through past relationships that sharing accounts only leads to issues (especially if incomes are disproportionate), and we also budget and manage our day-to-day in completely different ways. It easier to keep separate.
* Input/Income this is the income in my account post tax and post student loan. Aiming for end of 2027 to pay off student loan and the $300 from that to go straight into emergency savings initially, then onto the mortgage to pay of principal faster.
* Groceries we are working on bringing down. We very vigilantly meal plan, but in my defense, its tough merging families with food items that one half are used to/like, and the other half doesn't. Its early days but we are fine tuning our meal plans and finding ways the kids can compromise. We go through 6L of milk a week.
* Random expenses are things like car parking and one-off random costs that are unavoidable.
* Family - House/Kids is half of the costs for urgent work done on the house (replacing switchboard etc) and things we needed to move in. I expect this to decrease over the next 6 months as we finish off a few more things. Things like venues and costs for kids birthday parties are also included here.
* Personal - Purchases - This is a huge catch all and encompasses everything that I have purchased on my own accord, things like a new PC (my old one was on its death bed), and birthday and Christmas presents for others. I expect this one to drop drastically over the next 6 months.

Mistakes/leanings:

* Both myself and my partner are very frugal, you'll notice no alcohol, no coffee/cafe's, we have a pretty strict budget each for our fortnightly pay cycle. Upon receiving my pay I use automatic transfers to different accounts which constitutes 'buckets', ie X goes to mortgage account, Y to bills, Z to savings, leftovers was general spending. The reason savings are so low as we have been paying for urgent house work out of savings. However upon making this chart I was generally surprised by how much I have actually spent on personal items. Some of this has been genuine need, and some of it has been greed. I genuinely think, even though I pride myself on my rigid frugality (I still use a 5 year old $200 phone), I fell into the trap that as my income rose my expenditure did to, I think this was situation for being so cash poor for so long, I became a little envious of others who had higher incomes, as soon as that money was available I raced to catch up. I consider this a wake up call. I will be adjusting my budget buckets accordingly now to decrease general spending and increase savings each pay.

Goals:

* Short term: Increase savings to purchase contracting out agreement. Budget estimates 5 months savings, approximately $3000 cost. We have a combined net worth of $200k, the vast majority of that I brought to the table with the sale of my home, so that will need to be protected. I am offering to pay for the drafting and both parties legal fees as it is my initiative to contract out.
* Medium term: We require a new roof within the next 5 years, quote came in at $30,000. Savings will also simultaneously go to this account. Combined budget forecast is to achieve this by August 2027.
* Medium-ish term: Save for an emergency fund. The plan was to start on an emergency fund immediately however having to do urgent works on the house has stifled that. From late 2027 on-wards all savings will go towards emergency fund (+student loan extra income). Current forecast if incomes remain the same is to have $30,000 in emergency fund by early 2029.
* Beyond 2027: We both need new cars, both are almost 20 years old and are on their last legs. Current plan is drive our cars into the ground then either be in a position where my partner can get a work vehicle, or we buy one good economical car on finance for longer drives, and one cheap runaround for town.
* Long-term: Once these savings goals have been achieved and we both have newer cars, we will begin investing and paying down mortgage. Aiming for this to begin around 2029/age 40.",3,1763515791.0,PersonalFinanceNZ,2,0.72,False

1p0u8v9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0u8v9,Wpm Konos 71mm conical grinder,"Scoured the internet for everything I can find about this grinder before buying it, but there’s literally just 1 English youtube video about it and minimal info on reddit so I thought I’ll share my thoughts about it here after a month of use

I initially intended to upgrade from my stock 078s so I’ll mention it as a baseline for comparison

tldr for my wall of text below
Premium build & ok workflow — Matte aluminum body, huge smooth stepless dial, easy burr access, rpm display, ionizer, and knocker. Great overall feel, though the silicone dial cover and optional bellows attract dust.

Good performance with quirks — Quiet, handles medium roasts well, but grinding requires the turbo switch / bellows to clear grounds. RPM changes noticeably affect shot speed; bellows help with retention but can be messy.

Taste close to desired “blended” profile — 71mm Keber burrs give less brightness and fewer emphasized defects than the 078s, delivering a more cohesive, balanced cup without muting flavors.

——————
Wall of text for those interested 

Build quality & Design
- Its matte black aluminium body feels very premium. I thought my 078s already felt very premium but this tops it
- Big smooth stepless dial that doesn’t drift. There’s a silicone covering on the dial that gets dust on it quite easily, but removable if you don’t need it (easy to put back as well)
- Has an rpm display, ionizer, magnetic knocker. Quite ok for the workflow
- One step burr carrier removal. Seemed like a party trick at first, but after doing the star pattern screwing for my 078s the other day and finicking alignment I take it back lol
- Additional silicone bellow you can purchase. You can probably skip this if you use the rpm boost button as dust sticks on it quite easily

Workflow
- Cold start no problem even when I went with med-light beans. Not sure about light roasted beans
- Quiet grinder 
- Comes with a magic tumbler / just go grind direct to portafilter
- 🚩 Turbo switch is a must-use to get like >40% of the grounds out. If you don’t use this it won’t come out on its own even given the ionizer and knocker.
- Optional silicone bellows can be used to ensure zero retention, but comes with the mess of grounds on your table. RDT solves the mess, but I prefer not to. Toms grinder lab said this should get better as you season the burrs. Included 2 photos for how it looked after a month of use with no internal cleaning done
- 150-420 RPM seems to behave like others mentioned on the Weber key. With the same beans, grind size, and similar flow profile, I have measured 420 to be >10 seconds faster compared to 150. Supposedly you get higher body and less clarity at higher RPM, but I’m not sure if my taste experience was just placebo. I end up defaulting to 150rpm for medium beans and 270rpm for medium dark

Burrs / Taste 
- 71mm Keber Italian burr. I’m not someone who can do blind taste testing, but compared to 078s I was able to get the blended profile I wanted. Being able to get flavor separation is nice, but sometimes I just crave for coffee without highlighting all those taste notes. Konos doesn’t mute flavors but it won’t be as bright as you get from the 078s. Roast defects also don’t stand out with Konos which annoyed me with the 078s
- RPM turbo doesn’t seem to affect shot times when you do it after the initial grinding noise is finished. I really hoped they added an automatic 10s hold to it though so I can use that time instead of being glued to the grinder. I just use the bellows to get it over with quickly

All in all it’s a good grinder and fits the purpose of why I got it. I initially thought of selling the 078s once I got this, but I’ll keep them both since it reminded me how flat and conical burrs can have different taste profiles that I often crave for. The most annoying thing is just needing to do bellows/turbo, but this is pretty much end-game for me aside from that",8,1763515644.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

So I just started my new job (me, 25F) and they placed me with my coworker (25F also) to train me and get me up to speed.

From day one she has been so cold towards me, here are a few things she’s done:

1.	⁠Told me that she reported back to other female coworkers that I’m “normal” and not to worry about me being weird (this happened in the first week of being there, and is so random to even think that’s a normal thing to say to someone)
2.	⁠Told me that people usually get fired after 6 months (which I think was a ploy to scare me)
3.	⁠Went to a work function in my first week and told me beforehand that I was not allowed to “stick” to her or another colleague the whole night and to leave her alone
4.	⁠Told me I couldn’t listen to a group conversation and pulled everyone away from me to talk to them
5.	⁠She did not train me in anything for about 3 weeks and when I asked her how to do a task she told me “I’m not the boss of insert task”
6.	⁠Does not CC in any emails (which was hard because I was meant to be taking over her workload and had no knowledge of running tasks) and told me I must continue to CC her in emails even though she isn’t working on those tasks anymore
7.	⁠Hadn’t invited me to meetings
8.	⁠She also told me that nobody in the office will want to speak to me unless I make an effort first. So I tried to make an effort with everyone at the work event mentioned previously and she honestly made me feel so bad about myself that I began to think everyone hates me.

I guess I’m just confused on why she acts like this. She framed herself as cold to people, which made me feel like she thought I had to gain her “friendliness” or “respect”. She’s very close with everyone else in our office and chatty etc. inviting them to coffees and skipping me. She was meant to guide me through my first few months here and be a mentor but I genuinely feel like she wants me to fail. I guess I’m wondering how do I navigate this?

Documenting this nightmare so my brain stops ruminating 24/7.,"Hi everyone. I'm writing this because I've been replaying everything nonstop, and I'm hoping that putting it into words will help me stop ruminating and take at least one step forward in healing. My relationship ended last Friday, and based on everything I've learned, I truly believe my ex is fearful avoidant. We were together for almost 7 months and friends for 4 months before that.

I really loved him. And now I'm sitting here feeling heartbroken, confused, and honestly shocked at how everything unfolded.

# How We Met

We met on a dating app and our first date lasted 8 hours. It felt incredibly natural and easy. he was charming, funny, and a complete gentleman. We had so much in common, especially both being designers. We got coffee, brunch, drove around the city, visited his warehouse (he had his own business), and ended with dinner.

But during dinner, he suddenly became quiet. The energy shifted completely. After dropping me off with a hug and ""we should hang out again,"" he called 10 minutes later to say it wouldn't work out.

It hurt to be rejected, but I appreciated the honesty. We agreed to stay friends, and I started doing freelance design work for his business. Graphics for social media, merchandise, clothing designs. We genuinely became close friends, hanging out daily, talking everyday and all day, meeting each other's circles. Eventually we developed feelings and started dating officially.

# The First Discard (2 Weeks In)

He broke up with me after just two weeks of officially dating. Completely out of nowhere.

We went to dinner, he was silent the whole night, then said he'd jumped in too fast, had too much going on with his business, and couldn't do it, blah blah etc. Typical FA panic.

I was blindsided. We sat in his car for almost three hours while I cried and begged for an explanation. At one point he cried too and said, *""I don't know if I'm making the biggest mistake of my life right now.""*

I told him I was cutting contact and blocked him on everything except his phone, only because I really wasn't ready to completely cut it off just yet. The next night he sent long audio messages saying he didn't know why he did it, that he regretted it, that he was blind to how much I cared, and begged for another chance. He'd spent the previous day with his best friend of 20 years and cried in front of him for the first time. His friend later told me he'd called my ex stupid for what he did.

I gave him another chance. I really loved him. I told him if he ever did this again, I'd be gone for good.

# The Relationship After That

Things felt good at first but something was always ""off."" There was a gap I couldn't close no matter how much love, support, or emotional effort I gave. I tried to ignore that feeling in my gut and just kept with the relationship, hoping it was just baseless anxiety. We hung out almost every day. I thought we were getting even deeper as I met his entire family and he had met mine and just being thoroughly involved in each other's lives. We made so many plans.

I continued creating designs for his business while working full-time elsewhere. I'd go to his warehouse after 8-hour shifts to help with whatever he needed. He was also a micro-influencer with a successful YouTube channel and loyal fanbase. I was involved in all his social media. I never expected anything in return. I did it because I loved him and wanted to support his visions and his dreams. I believed in him fully.

But I became extremely insecure. That gut feeling and the voice in the back of my head never went away. I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong. I obsessed over how I looked, how I acted, how to keep the peace. I was constantly anxious and getting jealous in ways I'd never experienced before. By the end, I was scared to bring up anything that hurt me because he'd shut down and say, *""See, this is why I didn't want a relationship in the first place.""*

He said that more than once. And I stayed because I loved him and hoped he could meet me halfway someday.

I desperately wanted him to love me the way I loved him; to be chosen, to be seen, to feel secure. I lost weight, got every beauty treatment I could, made sure my hair and makeup were always done, wore everything he said he liked, bought outfits he wanted me to wear. I know how this sounds. That's how desperate I was to be reciprocated.

# The Final Breakup (Last Friday)

Everything came to a breaking point. Things were feeling even more off up to this day. I told him it always felt like he didn't truly want to love me. He said he did love me, but the obligation, pressure, and expectations were too much. I said I didn't understand. I tried so hard and did so much for us. It felt like I was giving unconditional love but his was conditional. I was asking for the bare minimum and he said he couldn't give it.

I asked him, *""Why is it so hard to love me?""*

Then he said things that broke me:

* I wasn't his type
* He wasn't attracted to me in the beginning
* I wasn't his ""dream girl""
* If I were his type, he would've done what I wanted in the relationship
* He would be happier without me

I remember my body feeling so cold. Hearing those words from someone I loved and supported so deeply... I can't describe the pain. I told him I was done. I'd be cutting contact for good this time. I stormed out.

I went straight to my sister's house and broke down. We were all supposed to go out for her birthday that night. Me, my sisters, cousins, and yes, even my ex was supposed to come. I told everyone I couldn't go, that I felt worthless. But my sisters and cousins cleaned me up, redid my makeup, dressed me up, and took me out anyway.

I cried in the bar, but something shifted. A stranger came up to me and said, *""I saw you crying and I just want to tell you that you are so beautiful. I know you're hurting but I can feel your heart and soul from across the room.""*

It clicked in that moment. A stranger was able to give me the reassurance and love I'd been desperately seeking from my ex. It made me realize that what he said wasn't a reflection of who I am, but who he is. That I am worthy of receiving all the love I deserve. That I'd lost myself trying to reach him, and things needed to end so I could grow and learn not to place my value and worth on just a guy.

# Saturday: The Reach-Out

Surprise surprise (obvi not really) he messaged me Saturday with another crying audio message asking to talk, apologizing. I agreed, but not for reconciliation. I wanted to end things properly, return his merchandise, and discuss the terms of using my designs.

Sunday night I went to his place. He immediately broke down crying, saying he was sorry, that he hadn't slept or eaten in 48 hours. He said he realized how shitty he'd been throughout our entire relationship. That what he said Friday was nasty and unnecessarily cruel. That he knew I was giving 110% while he only gave a fraction, that he used me as an emotional punching bag, that I didn't deserve any of it and should have run long ago. That he knew my love was unconditional but his was conditional.

He'd apparently driven for hours Friday night after I left, I guess trying to physically run from his guilt.

I asked why he said those terrible things. All he could say was he was *""just afraid of messing up.""* He said he knew he never sat me down and told me how amazing I was. He reiterated I did nothing wrong, that it was all him. That He has commitment issues and feels like he's running out of time with his life and goals.

I was mostly silent, crying. I told him I love him, but I need to love myself more. I can't put myself through this anymore. I hope he learns and grows from this, just like I will. I told him awareness is just the first step and I hope he figures out why he is the way he is in relationships.

He said he'd never block me, that he'd always be there if I wanted to talk. He said he would always pick up if I call. I said no. I need to completely block him to move on. He understood. I asked one last time if he really loved me, if it was real. He said, *""Of course it was.""*

We hugged goodbye. I left one final audio message thanking him for apologizing and saying I'll always cherish our memories. That I wish him well and hope he learns from this.

# Where I Am Now

And here I am. He's been officially blocked from everything. There's no way for him to reach me now. I'm still hurting so much. Part of me wishes he hadn't apologized so I could get over this easier. But I still have love for him. I'm grieving the what-ifs and the love we did share.

I keep cycling through thinking I wasn't worthy enough for him to change for me, to try harder. Logically, I know it's not me. It's him and his FA patterns. But I'm struggling to truly believe it. I know it'll get better, but it still hurts. I still miss him. I still love him.

He broke me down and I'm left alone picking up the pieces. While he'll still be surrounded by fans and friends who praise him. Part of me is bitter. Part of me feels guilty for being bitter and a bit resentful. I don't hate him. But it also just still feels unfair. Because despite it all, I don't hate him. 

He has a big event for his business this weekend and a lot of what he's using, including a very large wall vinyl poster, I designed. I told him he could use them because I made them to support him. But part of me hopes that poster and everything else I made for him looms over him with the thought of me and what he did to me.

I gave so much. I keep wondering: Is he as hurt as I am? Does he miss me? Will he regret everything? I know this ending was needed, not just for him, but for me; so I can reconnect with myself and learn to walk away at the first sign of disrespect and red flags. But then I spiral: Was I just another girl on his roster? He could easily choose a model from IG, why would he miss me?

Yet part of me also fantasizes about him fully healed and us reconnecting. I know I don't want him back right now. But I also do. I don't know. I wish it could've been him. I wish I could've been the one he wanted to change for.

I just feel so scared. Who I was that Friday night died and I'm now going to evolve into someone different. I feel okay. Then I don't. Then I keep thinking about him and I don't want to think about him anymore because it just hurts so much. I don't want to hurt anymore.

Why couldn't he give me unconditional love?

Short summary of the post, just in case this feels like a long read.  I am looking to find that one right person/connection to put in the effort to understand you as a person. Ideally a setup where more emphasis is given to the friend’s part than the benefits(The benefits part would be limited to basic non penetrative intimacy). 

Tbh I am someone who grew up with social anxiety and Introvertedness which I guess has worked against  me sometimes in life and I am working on it and doing  better now . But i am just one “hey, how are you” away from opening up. I give out golden retriever energy once I get along with you. Being a giver in nature, I would love to find a connection where I could be an absolute giver, feel comfortable around each other, laugh and talk.
I’d like to chat and get to know one another, and feel comfortable around. Feeling secure in each other's company is the biggest mental turn-on at the end of the day.

**The guy who you'd be meeting (Me):**

* Physical aspect-I am fit athletic, in shape 5’8-9 ish” tall.151.
* Curly-wavy dark hair, really cute face -kinda cute/hot nerd vibes,glasses,  can be nerdy sometimes.
* Always in shape & line clean stubble, carry myself well.
* Been told I am cute but you can be the judge. Drugs and disease-free, I expect the same from you. Please be DDF. I don’t drink or smoke, but I’m fine if you do and I respect individual choices  as long as they’re not taken to excess. After all, too much of anything is always bad.
* Impeccable hygiene, decent skincare routine.
* An absolute scent-head. 
* Interests & Life-Educated-career-driven, physically active(running, gym).In the meantime, I am very ambitious about life and goals, and hustle every single day to achieve those goals.
* Emotional terms-I am a sensitive (HSP) person, an overthinker sometimes, kind-hearted, and cannot ruin someone’s day and get back to bed peacefully that would haunt me. I strive to make people’s day and make them smile, no matter how my day is going.
* Humble, compassionate, empathetic, believe in giving back to this world and charity. I have made street friends. I exchange coffees & sandwiches with them sometimes and I love them. I can introduce you to them if you wanna meet them when we grab a coffee.

* Pretty decent at playing pool and billiards. I bet you can’t beat me in a game of pool, haha.
* Love deep conversations and value details. I try to find joy in simplistic things around myself. Love nature, skies, stars, sunsets, astronomy, aurora. A person who’d prefer be at  beach watching the sunset over being at a nightclub.
* Value real-time quality connections. Often told that I am more interesting in person than online, and that I hold pretty deep conversations whenever I had the chance to speak to a random stranger. Emotionally intelligent.
* Iced lattes over hot, Beaches over Mountains, chopsticks over fork. Weekend, G-Eazy, Hans Zimmer, Juice WRLD, Post Malone, Travis Scott, Lana Del Rey, EDM, R&B, PHONK.
* I am an introverted extrovert with the right person and vibe, a straight resting bitch face with a completely opposite personality.

* Willing to meet in a public setup so could get to know me better as a person. 
* Availability & location-Weekends and occasionally on weekdays. I am fine with anything in and around GTA. 
* Would pay great attention to your body’s pleasure points and nonverbal cues.
*Great emphasis on consent and communication.
*Really good with hands, veiny arms and hands and you’d love that massage if you’re into receiving  massages.
*I’ve been through a lot ups and downs in my life lately,I’d be happy to find a connection and someone who’d see a friend in me .

**The person I'd love to meet (You):**
* Between 25-44.  Would prefer someone older. If you are younger and reaching out plsx100 write few lines of  introduction and be mature.
*Open to all races and ethnicities as long as you fit the description.
* Humble, down to earth, easy to talk.
*Loves kissing and makeouts.
*Pls be a clear communicator, I’ve been stoodup twice recently and trust me it just messes up the whole schedule and mood after putting in some decent efforts.

Be ready to verify and exchange SFW pics at the start of the conversation I’d do the same. I am not wasting your/my time chatting without verification(crumbled paper method).

The core problem with AI conversations today: they disappear. All that context, those insights, the nuanced understanding you built up over hours of discussion, gone the moment the chat ends. You start fresh every time, copy-pasting context, re-explaining your project for the hundredth time or begging AI to just read the frigging contents of your projects folder or [claude.md](http://claude.md) file.

With Basic Memory your AI conversations persist. Pick up exactly where you left off, days or weeks later, with full context intact. No more wondering if AI deemed something important enough to remember.   


**2. Knowledge That Compounds Over Time**

Unlike chat histories that just pile up into an unsearchable mess, Basic Memory builds a semantic knowledge graph. Each conversation strengthens connections between ideas. Your Ethiopian coffee notes automatically link to your pour-over brewing techniques, which connect to your water temperature experiments.

Which means your knowledge doesn't just accumulate, it grows. The AI can traverse these connections to provide insights you never would have found by mere keyword searching.



**3. Import All Your Existing AI Conversations**

Don't start from scratch. Basic Memory can import your entire conversation history from Claude and ChatGPT with a single command. All that context you've built over months? It becomes part of your searchable knowledge graph right away.

Everything you've already learned becomes instantly accessible and connected.



**4. Works Across All Your AI Tools**

Basic Memory isn't locked to a single AI platform. Through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it works with:

* Claude Desktop, web, and mobile
* ChatGPT Desktop, web, and mobile
* Gemini in Terminal
* VS Code
* Cursor
* Claude Code
* Any MCP-compatible AI assistant

One knowledge base, accessible everywhere. Have a conversation in Claude Desktop, continue it in VS Code, reference it from your phone. Your knowledge isn't held hostage by platform lock-in.



**5. You Own Your Data, Forever**

Everything lives as plain Markdown files on your machine (or in your private webapp if you prefer). No proprietary formats. No vendor lock-in. No data harvesting. No ""oops, we got acquired and everything changes"" surprises.

Want to back it up? Copy the folder. Want to move it? Point to a new directory. Want to read it without Basic Memory? Open the files in any text editor. It's yours, permanently.



**6. AI Can Read AND Write to Your Knowledge**

Unlike RAG systems where AI can only query your documents, Basic Memory is bidirectional. The AI can:

* Write new notes during conversations
* Edit existing notes
* Create connections between topics
* Search and traverse your knowledge graph

Meanwhile, you can edit the same files in your webapp, or Obsidian, VS Code, or any other text editor. Real collaboration, not just question-and-answer.



**7. Multi-Project Organization**

Keep different knowledge contexts separate. Switch between:

* Work projects (architecture decisions, API documentation)
* Personal learning (test prep, language learning)
* Research projects (academic papers, literature reviews)
* Creative work (novel writing, world building, character development)

The AI understands which project you're in and provides relevant context automatically. No more mixing your database architecture notes with your sourdough recipes.



**8. Cloud or Local - Your Choice**

Start local with complete control and privacy. Everything on your machine, nothing sent to servers you don't control.

Ready to scale? Basic Memory Cloud syncs across devices and platforms. Your notes available anywhere anytime. 



**9. Works Seamlessly with Obsidian**

We’re Obsidian superfans, so we made sure your Basic Memory notes play nice with it. It’s pretty straightforward because Basic Memory’s notes are just Markdown files in folders. Point Obsidian at your Basic Memory directory and you get:

* Graph view of your knowledge connections
* All Obsidian plugins
* Canvas for visual organization
* The familiar Obsidian interface
* Two-way sync (edit in either, see changes everywhere)



**10. Its Core is Open Source and Built on Standards**

Basic Memory uses:

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** \- the emerging standard for AI tool integration
* **Standard Markdown** \- human-readable, future-proof format
* **Open source license (AGPL-3.0)** \- see exactly how it works

If Basic Memory disappeared tomorrow, you'd still have perfectly readable, usable notes. No black boxes. No proprietary formats. No lock-in.



**The Bottom Line**

Basic Memory transforms ephemeral AI conversations into lasting, interconnected knowledge. You own it. It works everywhere. It gets smarter over time.

Whether you're a developer building complex systems, a researcher synthesizing literature, a writer organizing creative work, or anyone who thinks deeply with AI assistance, Basic Memory ensures your insights persist and compound.

Cleaned up my eating, cut out all sugar, soda, creamers from my coffee completely, and started melting lbs. I started walking a ton averaging around 10-12k steps a day. 
Dropped to around 220lbs, my lowest weight since middle school. Took about 1 year. Fell off the wagon and started junk eating again and gained back to 250ish lbs in 2024. 
Started again eating healthy, walking a ton and actually working out in the beginning of this year and plateaued around 220lbs again. 
February of 25’ I went and had emergency gall bladder removal. All was great after. Took around 4 ish months to fully heal after a complication. 
Now my biggest issue is when I’m doing abdominal workouts, my entire right side stomach locks up in a huge knot, brings me to my knees it’s so painful. Right near one of the incision marks from my surgery. I bend wrong, the muscle gets so tight it takes my breath away. Should I keep pushing forward? This happen to anyone else who had abdominal surgery? My stomach is hands down the worst part of me in my mind,, and not being able to fully push an ab workout is killing me as I feel stuck
My weight has also flatlined at 220-225 for the past 3 months. Not gaining, but keeping the same routine, I don’t seem to be loosing any more weight.

1p0tuda,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackwoodsCreepy/comments/1p0tuda/the_only_sound_worse_than_the_nonmhuman_laughter/,The only sound worse than the non-mhuman laughter outside our RV was the sound of my friend's bullet hitting it.,"You know, I still replay the events of this trip in my head, even though it all happened a few years ago now. It was supposed to be the ultimate hunting expedition a classic buddy trip with my friend Gabe down to the Henry Mountains. I'd hunted all over Utah, but nothing prepared me for what we experienced down there. It’s hard to even talk about it without getting that cold, sinking feeling in my gut. What started as the fulfillment of a long held dream quickly turned into a week of dread, culminating in an encounter that changed how I look at the wilderness forever.

The kind of anticipation Gabe and I felt that November morning was almost painful. We’d been planning this trip for over a year, ever since we successfully snagged the permits to hunt the Henry Mountains. Anyone who knows anything about big game knows that these mountains, five hours south of our hometown in Salt Lake City, are legendary. They hold giant mule deer that rival anything in the Rockies, and a genetically pure herd of bison you can’t find anywhere else. Those permits felt like lottery winnings, and we were practically buzzing as we packed up the RV for the long drive down. The air was crisp and cold, already smelling like winter even though the official snow hadn't hit yet. We talked smack the entire drive, arguing over who would bag the bigger buck, fueled by stale gas station coffee and the sheer excitement of finally heading out to the high desert. This wasn't any normal hunting trip, it was a pilgrimage.

We finally found our spot, pulling the RV up near a dramatic cliff face. The view alone made the five hour trek worth the time and expense. Looking east, the expanse of Utah’s canyonlands unfolded in a breathtaking panorama. The light was starting to turn golden as the sun dipped, painting the rugged landscape in a hue that honestly stopped us in our tracks. It was the kind of vista that felt too big for humanity, instantly making you feel small and insignificant. We started setting up the basic camp, and right away, we felt a difference in this place. It wasn't just quiet; it was heavy. We saw the usual sign wolf scat and tracks but then Gabe found a massive paw print near the dry creek bed, too large and oddly shaped to be a standard black bear. It was unsettling, but we shook it off as a mountain lion or maybe just a misidentified bear. Our goal was to get camp secured before dark, so we were running lines for a canopy and hanging up some powerful LED lanterns. That's when I noticed it: hanging low from the branch of an ancient juniper tree was a crude, disturbing object. It was a totem made of old, dry sticks lashed together with leather strips, covered in faded feathers. It looked old and intentional. We both stared at it for a moment. ""Native folks probably used it for a blessing or something,"" Gabe mumbled, already pulling it down. I felt a weird prickle of discomfort, like we shouldn’t touch it, but we were focused on utility. We tossed the thing deep into a thicket of scrub oak just outside our lit perimeter and got back to work. As soon as that totem left the tree, the quiet atmosphere turned sharp, like a dropped knife.

The trouble started almost immediately after we discarded the strange marker. It began subtly, with faint, ambient sounds that we initially dismissed as the wind playing tricks. But soon, it evolved into something more focused, like whispers. They weren't loud enough to make out, just a low, indistinct murmur, like someone speaking a language we’d never heard, just beyond the edge of our hearing. It was constant, a low level static that frayed the nerves. One night, a few days into the trip, we were just settling down, listening to the crackle of the fire. The air was dead still. Then, from the dense forest line near the cliff's edge, a sound rose up a profound, heartbroken mourning. It wasn’t an animal’s cry, it was distinctly human, full of anguish and sorrow, a sound that chilled you to the bone. It didn't last long, maybe twenty seconds, but the silence that followed felt absolute, crushing. Another evening, while we were around the campfire enjoying a much deserved dinner of chili and cornbread, the forest ripped open with a horrible, piercing scream. I’ve heard injured animals before and that definitely was not an injured animal, it was prolonged and guttural, ending in a choke. We grabbed our rifles, hearts hammering, and searched with flashlights, but there was nothing. No tracks, no disturbed brush, just the same oppressive silence that seemed to swallow sound whole. There were other nights, too, when we’d wake up to the rhythmic beat of drums and deep, rhythmic chanting, like some sort of ancient ritual or dance party was happening just out of sight in the deeper woods, invisible behind the veil of night.

It was becoming clear that whatever this presence was, it was trying to mess with our heads, trying to lure us away from the safety of the RV. The most chilling example of this was the night I was jolted awake by Gabe violently shaking my arm. ""Will, wake up! Do you hear that?"" My ears were ringing in the dark silence, and then I heard it the unmistakable, thin cry of a baby coming from the trees. We spent an agonizing hour trying to find the source, eventually calling Search and Rescue, convinced a lost infant was freezing out there. SAR arrived hours later, searched, and found absolutely nothing. They looked at us like we were crazy. The next afternoon, the thing tried to trick me directly. I was cleaning my hunting rifle, doing some final checks, when I heard Gabe’s voice calling my name excitedly from the edge of the woods. ""Will! Come quick, you gotta see this! I found something cool!"" He was motioning rapidly for me to hurry. I secured the rifle and took three steps toward him when a voice, clear and solid, said right behind me, ""Hey Will, where ya going?"" I spun around so fast my neck cracked. There, standing just outside the RV door, was the real Gabe, looking bewildered, wiping grease from his hands. I whipped my head back toward the forest where the decoy had been, and there was nothing. No movement, no sign of anyone or anything. Gabe must have seen the blood drain from my face because he dropped his rag and asked what was wrong. I just shook my head, unable to articulate the sheer horror of seeing my best friend beckon me into the woods, knowing it wasn't him.

The night before we were scheduled to head back to Salt Lake City, we were completely exhausted from a full day of hunting that yielded nothing but frustration. We collapsed into our bunks around 10 PM. I guess we were so tired that the events of the last week didn't register until 2:00 AM, when a sound ripped me out of a deep sleep. It was laughter, but not human laughter. It was a high pitched, rasping sound, like a bird’s shriek mixed with a human snicker, coming from right outside the RV. It felt mocking and malicious. Before either of us could fully sit up, the entire RV started to shake violently not a tremor, but a rapid, rhythmic shaking, like something massive was grabbing it and trying to flip it over. The sound was deafening. When the shaking suddenly stopped, Gabe was instantly alert. He grabbed his .30-06 and, believing it was a very large, aggressive bear, flung the RV door open. He didn't even aim, just started shooting three rapid rounds into the absolute darkness, yelling, ""Damn bear!"" All I could hear was the booming of the rifle, and then, a sickening sound: an animal’s fierce growl, immediately followed by a faint, wretched human groan. Gabe had hit something, because the next sound was something heavy and fast crashing away through the dense, dry brush, running deeper into the forest. We spent the rest of the night wide awake, guns drawn, listening to the deep silence that followed.

We didn't sleep another wink. As the first light of dawn began to paint the sky with streaks of brilliant pink, we cautiously stepped out, armed and terrified. The first thing we saw was the devastation around the RV flattened ground, bent saplings, and then, unmistakable evidence of the night’s encounter. There was a huge, fresh paw print, far too big to belong to any black bear, and clear drops of blood leading away from the side of the vehicle. Gabe didn't hesitate. We followed the trail of blood and the massive prints leading directly toward the secluded part of the cliff face, the same place the mourning had come from days earlier. The trail ended at an old, gnarled tree right at the cliff's edge. Gabe, focused on the prints, walked straight under its branches. “Think the bear jumped?” he whispered, his voice catching in his throat. He turned back to look at me, but I had stopped about twenty feet back, staring up at the tree, a wave of cold nausea washing over me as the horrifying truth dawned on me. Gabe, seeing my pale, fixed gaze, looked up, too. Hanging from the high branches, wrapped in fading funerary cloth and aged offerings, was a perfectly preserved Native American burial bundle. He was standing directly on hallowed, sacred ground. My heart hammered with the realization that we hadn't been dealing with a bear or a mountain lion; we had disturbed something ancient and powerful by removing that totem. We didn't exchange another word. We raced back to the RV, packed our gear in a blur of panicked efficiency, and drove the five hours straight back to Salt Lake City, leaving the Henry Mountains behind us forever. I am convinced to this day that we tangled with something darker than any predator a Skinwalker or perhaps a Windigo. Whatever it was, the whole sequence of events, from the baby crying to the decoy of Gabe, was nothing more than a carefully orchestrated attempt to lure us into the woods so it could finish what we started when we tossed that totem into the brush.",20,1763514539.0,BackwoodsCreepy,9,0.86,False
