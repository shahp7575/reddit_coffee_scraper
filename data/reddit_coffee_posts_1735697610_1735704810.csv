I enjoy knowing people from all walks of life and learning about new perspectives over a variety of topics. We can chat about the state of the world, life goals, hot takes, anything really.

A bit about me:

I work in tech and code a bit outside of work as a hobby. I play 2 instruments and love classical music/music theory. I like dabbling in stuff like arts and crafts, creative writing, DnD, baking cookies, and traveling. I drink tea, wear sweaters, and have a cat on my lap so my aesthetic is grandma-core

additional hobbies: having existential thoughts, pacing around my room, fixating on fictional universes and hypothetical scenarios, doomscrolling reddit, drinking caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea, oversharing

I'm a generally ambitious person so people who obsess over their life goals and the future like I do we may get along ",0,1735704389.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False

I started my coffee journey about 2 months ago. I got myself a Delonghi ECP35.31. I have a question about the water pressure. I know espresso making is pressurised water passing through coffee grinds and I have this concept in mind that pressurised means ""jets of water"" or ""stronger"" flow of water. Am I wrong or does the water flow in the videos seem weak? Any advice? 

Thank you in advance.

1hqv76l,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hqv76l/former_coworkers_love_message/,Former co-worker's love message,"An old work colleague (30f) that I (46m) worked with around 8 years ago, and that I have kept sporadic contact with (like a coffee or a skype call once or twice a year) just sent me a text with greetings for the new year.

In the message she also explains that over the last year she has learned a lot, including the fact that beautiful things should not remain unspoken and that she wanted me to know that I was very important to her during the year that we worked together and that she was in love with me back then but never directly declared it because of the age difference, the fear of rejection, and that she didn't know how I felt towards her and how I would react.

She also clarifies that that was a long time ago, and that she is not looking for anything at this point but that nonetheless it was important for her to disclose how she felt about me back then because I had a very positive impact on her at a very important time in her life.

Back then I kind of knew that she may be attracted to me but I did not know the extent of her feelings as she is describing them now.

Also, I never acted on it because of the age difference, the potential complications of dating a coworker, the fact the she was rather extroverted whereas I am am complete introvert, and also physically she was not really my type, or not obviously anyway. However the kind of conversations I had with her were a lot deeper than what I would have with the other coworkers, and we developed a meaningful connection. We really got each other despite our differences.

After receiving her text, I feel flattered, thankful, intrigued and confused all at once. I am single by the way, and as an introvert who is currently working the night shift, my social life is not exactly rich, I don't have a relationship and I don't date either.

Ever since reading her message, even though she clearly states that she is not looking to go on a date or any thing like that, I have not been able to stop thinking about her.

I wonder whether there is a chance to start meeting up with her more often and leave the door open to possibly have something more with her, or I should take her words at face value and accept that she is not looking for anything more than our current friendship. I mean, she could have a partner for all I know. However, I can't help but think why this message and why now...

What do you people think about this?

It's quite in the morning unless I decide to play music. I can make my coffee. No noise from kids, no need to prepare/cook breakfast and then get complaints about it. 

After work is done, I can eat my dinner in peace. I can relax and watch TV or a movie (and choose what I want to watch). I can work out at home or at my apartment gym. I can sit on the couch and immerse myself in a book. I can go to a Pilates class. I can practice classical Indian dance. I can go take an adult acting class. 

If it's the weekend, I can wake up leisurely, have my morning coffee, do a round of meditation, do a yoga class, socialize/connect with friends/family if I choose, read some more, visit a coffee shop with a nice atmosphere either with someone so we can have a great conversation, or by myself to read/study/work on something. I can work towards learning a new language if I want. If it's summer, I can plan to visit the observatory with friends and do star gazing. I can dress up and go to the ballet, or theater, or an event. I can visit the art museum and become immersed in the environment.

And best of all...I can travel. I can travel to another city or another country. I have the freedom and funds to do so.

1hqv4n1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqv4n1,Victoria in December 🏛️🎄🍺🫖🦆 (detailed trip report),"Just spent a lovely two and half days in Victoria. We didn’t have a car and stayed in the downtown area for most of the trip. Hope this report helps other visitors. Wishing everyone happy new year! 

**Day 1**
- Arrived via **Victoria Clipper** ferry from Seattle and checked in at **Hotel Grand Pacific**. Really great **Gingerbread house** competition display in the lobby. Rooms here are traditional style but clean, comfortable and very spacious. The location is great too, easy walk to the waterfront and downtown but not right in the thick of it. 
- **Afternoon Tea at Pendray Inn and Tea House**. The vibe is really quaint, relaxing and cozy. It was way too much sweets for us to finish. We didn’t really need to drink 2 pots of tea but it was nice to sample something different. 
- Visited **The Empress**. Glad we picked Pendray for afternoon tea, by comparison the Empress was dark, crowded and noisy/echo-y, not really a relaxing vibe.
- Walked along **Inner Habor and downtown Government St.** Stopped by **Munro’s Books, Murchie’s tea, The Bay Center for Festival of Trees**. The Bay Center felt pretty empty, aside from seeing the trees there weren’t any good shops. 
- Happy Hour at **Irish Times Pub**. Very festive decor. Had Irish Coffee, Guinness beer and Irish stew. 
- Went back to our hotel room for a quick break, since we had been up since 6am from the ferry. 
- Dinner at **Chobap Sushi Bar**. Probably the highlight of our trip! New omakase place, specializes in seared nigiri. We also had the sake flight which was delicious and fun. Only 8 people per seating so it’s quite intimate and you can watch Chef Clark prepare each course up close. Pacing is quite fast for omakase, each seating is 1.5 hours (with 4 seatings per evening), but it’s very affordable compared to most omakase places in North America! 

**Day 2**
- Morning swim, hot tub and sauna at Hotel Grand Pacific. We tried going the night before and it was a zoo. Tons of kids and families. The morning was slightly better, but still not as empty as I thought it would be at 7:30-8am!
- Brunch at **Fathom**. Not crowded, no wait, delicious food, beautiful interior. Wish we we had more people to share with since everything on the menu looked delicious!  
- The sun came out so we walked around **Beacon Hill Park**. Lovely park even in the winter. So many ducks! And surprised to find peacocks. Didn’t bring the right shoes or would’ve spent an additional hour walking all the way down to the beach and water. 
- Lunch at **Bard & Banker**. Basically same vibes as the Irish Times Pub but more British food and a posh interior. Burger was pretty great. 
- Attended the **Nutcracker Ballet at Royal Theater**. Lovely performance in a beautiful venue. We were pretty high up in the balcony center seats but still got a great view. 
- Dinner at **ENe Raw Food & Sake Bar**. We had the Shokado Box which is a sampler of a bunch of appetizers and sashimi. Fried food was good but the sushi was just ok. Probably our least favorite meal from the trip but still above average food wise. 
- **Christmas lights at Butchart Gardens**. Would have been a disappointing tourist trap if not for the musical performances by the brass quartet and Christmas carolers, which were charming. We finished walking around the gardens in 30 minutes (too crowded to enjoy, you basically have to walk at a snail pace behind a line of people, and the light displays were not as good as we have seen before at Capilano). The “tour” commentary on the bus ride was really lackluster and it took 2 hours round trip to go to and back from the gardens. Anyways, I’m fine doing it once since it’s the thing to do in Victoria, but I would probably not go back for the winter lights. 

**Day 3**
- Breakfast at **Discovery Coffee (and Yonni’s Donuts).** Great coffee, good donuts.
- Watched **Arctic: Our Frozen Planet** at the IMAX theater. Probably could’ve skipped it but by day 3 we were running out of things we wanted to do. Very cheap movie tickets and everyone got a good seat since the theater was so empty. 
- Visited the **Legislative Assembly Building**. We did the Free Guided tour, no one else seemed interested so it turned into a private tour for just us two. Our tour guide was super friendly and fun! Got lucky and they took us to do a “secret” tour of the Legislative Library that is not open to the public, it was so so cozy and beautiful in there, felt like being in Hogwarts. I highly recommend doing the Free Guided Tour, you’ll learn a lot more about the architecture, Victoria’s history and the Canadian government. 
- Lunch at **Italian Food Imports**. Great simple sandwiches and friendly service. 
- Walked around **Chinatown, Johnson Street Bridge.** Wasn’t really much to do in Chinatown, it’s tiny. 
- Second lunch at **Finn’s Seafood Chop Cocktails**. Amazing seafood and dessert was great too! It’s pricey but probably my favorite meal from the trip aside from Chobap. 
- **Fathom** Happy Hour on the terrace. We got a seat with a fire table and just relaxed with some drinks and a snack. It was good to eat right before boarding the ferry back, since the food on board Clipper is neither good nor tasty. 

Overall, I think it was worth visiting in December if you’re already in Vancouver or Seattle, maybe not worth it if you’re flying from somewhere else. It was still beautiful in winter, probably more so in other seasons!

**Tips:**
- I really wanted to do HAVN Sauna and even checked to make a booking like 2-3 weeks before, but it was already sold out. So I recommend just getting tickets as soon as possible when they are released. 
- Check schedules and opening hours beforehand. Many places are closed on Mondays/Tuesdays. Reserve ahead for Afternoon Tea. 
- We didn’t rent a car on this trip and it was fine walking around, but I think it limited things to do for us. If you’re visit outside of winter, definitely consider a car rental to explore more of the sights and scenery. ",25,1735703800.0,VictoriaBC,3,1.0,False

This happened during the time my wife was fighting cancer. We were hard up for money because of the hospital bills.
So to give you a lay out of the little store. Pull up in front and there were two picnic tables on either side of the front door. Walk in and to your left is were you can get coffee and soda. To your right the cash register and straight down the isle is the coolers to the beer. 
So it had been a busy day and when it finally slowed down the lady I was working with went outside to take a break. This was late afternoon. I was the only person in the store and was cleaning up the counter after making sandwiches. I was not really paying attention until a man tall with red hair  who was maybe late thirties got my attention when he was standing in front of the register. 
To be honest I jumped a little because he scared me because I did not hear him come in. Asked him what I could do to help him and he asked me to make him a itilian sandwich. So I started making the sandwich for him and we made lite conversation. As I turned  my back on him so I could grab the provolone cheese he wanted he just was not there anymore. I was like what the fuck! This is a very small store  so I know I would see him if he was still in there. I also did not hear the door sensor go off. So I literally shot around the side of counter and shot outside.  I ask Martha which way he went. The street is very long and straight in both directions so I would have seen him. She was like who are you talking about? So I told her who I saw. She saw  no one. Where she was setting was right beside the door so she would have seen him. That freaked me out. He was so solid looking. I am thinking he may have come across from the funeral home across the street.

Going to Europe in late November 2025 and a bit time restricted to about 21 days. I'm going with my 17 and 14 year old sons. I have to assume we have to cut some countries/places down hence my question 

We're big foodies (more western style, I'm a bit picky with anything too foreign but I love pasta and chocolate and coffee etc) and big into classical music/concerts, castles and motorsport. My eldest son is pretty set on wanting to ski for the first time too and I want to go on a big cable car across the alps and would love to do the brenner pass and/or bernina express train too. I'm looking at Austria, Germany, Switzerland and a bit of Italy before flying over to Amsterdam and a couple of small towns in France before flying home.

Obviously we wouldn't be travelling all over those countries, rather a few towns here and there but even then I know we're going to have to cut something out.

Any ideas on where I should start? Obviously the weather isn't going to be the best but it's my son's high school graduation present and he's pretty set on going in late November to mid December.

1. my sps tik tok came up on my fyp. for context my sp is my ex and for matters of easing my mind and detaching i muted her on tik tok. i am a firm believer of the universe will show you things of what you need to see so i believe that just seeing her randomly pop up was a sign to show me i am in alignment with my manifestation

2. i saw my sp and her whole family while i was out. i simply was driving to a coffee shop wondering if i was going to see her there, i stopped myself and stated “whatever is meant to happen, WILL happen.” next thing i know i see her and her whole family. we face each other a smile and i talked to her parents, as i was talking to her parents she was absolutely STARING at me (that is a sign as well)

3. i saw her dad today in our local target

i never ran into her until i made the shift within my mind, simply truly sitting down with myself and embodying the person who knows we are getting back together.

I’m a trauma survivor and this particular book club is only for other trauma survivors. So only join us if you’re one of us and can interact positively with others. Be able to tolerate others’ vulnerability while being vulnerable yourself.

Hoping to do weekly Zoom meets to discuss readings. The links will be in WhatsApp so that only members can join in. No gawkers. Folks can drop in and out whenever; there’s no expectation of weekly commitment. 

I just want to read more life-altering literature and hear my fellow survivors’ perspectives on influential trauma writing… while keeping it motivational.

I’m leaning towards Smile, You’re Traveling for our first book bc it’s good and affordable but I’m open to your suggestions. Just don’t want anyone to be priced out.

If you’d like the link to the WhatsApp group with the Zoom meet details, just message me. 

May your 2025 be full of good reads and great music and black coffee!",5,1735702739.0,henryrollins,0,1.0,False

1hquqf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1hquqf0/what_role_does_content_creation_play_in_digital/,What role does content creation play in digital brand growth?,"Content creation is a cornerstone of digital brand growth, as it helps businesses build a strong online presence, engage with their target audience, and establish authority within their industry. Here's how content creation plays a critical role in digital brand growth:

### 1. Establishing Brand Identity

* **Voice and Personality:** Consistent content creation helps shape a brand's voice and personality, making it recognizable and relatable. Whether through blog posts, videos, social media updates, or podcasts, every piece of content reflects your brand's values, tone, and mission. Over time, this consistency builds brand loyalty and trust.
   * **Example:** Nike’s content, such as inspirational stories and motivational campaigns, conveys a sense of empowerment, aligning with their brand identity.

### 2. Driving Traffic and SEO Benefits

* **Organic Search Visibility:** High-quality, optimized content (like blogs, videos, or FAQs) can improve your search engine ranking, making your brand more visible on search engines like Google. Content rich in relevant keywords helps boost organic traffic, increasing your chances of being discovered by new customers.
   * **Example:** HubSpot's blog consistently ranks for terms related to inbound marketing and CRM solutions, driving organic traffic to its website.

### 3. Engaging with Customers

* **Two-Way Communication:** Content creation allows brands to engage with their audience directly. Social media posts, comment sections, interactive content (like polls, quizzes), and user-generated content encourage feedback and interaction, fostering a sense of community.
   * **Example:** Starbucks encourages customers to share their experiences and creative coffee recipes on social media, often re-sharing customer-generated content, which helps strengthen customer engagement.

### 4. Educating Your Audience

* **Building Authority and Trust:** By providing valuable, educational content, brands can position themselves as experts in their field. This not only attracts potential customers but also builds trust, as consumers are more likely to purchase from brands they perceive as knowledgeable.
   * **Example:** The Content Marketing Institute publishes detailed resources and research on content marketing trends, solidifying its authority in the digital marketing space.

### 5. Showcasing Products and Services

* **Demonstrating Value:** Content creation allows brands to highlight their products or services in action. Through tutorials, case studies, product demos, and customer testimonials, brands can showcase how their offerings solve specific problems, improving conversion rates.
   * **Example:** Apple’s product launch videos, which feature in-depth looks at new technology and how it benefits users, contribute to its product’s hype and anticipation.

### 6. Enhancing Customer Retention

* **Building Long-Term Relationships:** Consistently producing valuable content keeps your audience engaged and coming back for more. Whether it's educational resources, entertaining social media content, or exclusive behind-the-scenes glimpses, customers who engage with your content are more likely to become repeat buyers.
   * **Example:** A subscription-based service like **Dollar Shave Club** creates content that provides tips, guides, and humor, keeping customers engaged even after their initial purchase.

### 7. Amplifying Brand Awareness

* **Sharing Your Brand Story:** Content creation helps tell the story behind your brand, explaining your mission, values, and the impact you want to make. This emotional connection can attract new customers and increase brand awareness.
   * **Example:** TOMS Shoes has built its brand around the “One for One” concept, sharing its mission and success stories through powerful content that resonates with socially conscious consumers.

### 8. Supporting Social Proof

* **User-Generated Content and Reviews:** Content created by satisfied customers, such as reviews, testimonials, and social media posts, can significantly boost your brand’s credibility. User-generated content not only serves as social proof but also drives additional engagement, as it helps customers feel more connected to the brand.
   * **Example:** GoPro leverages content created by its users, often reposting extreme sports footage captured with GoPro cameras, which increases engagement and serves as authentic endorsements.

### 9. Lead Generation and Conversion

* **Creating Lead Magnets:** Content such as ebooks, webinars, whitepapers, or guides can be used as lead magnets to capture valuable customer data. When combined with targeted calls-to-action (CTAs), content creation can drive conversions by guiding prospects down the sales funnel.
   * **Example:** Neil Patel’s website offers free downloadable SEO guides and resources in exchange for email signups, which helps build an email list for future marketing.

### 10. Facilitating Multi-Channel Marketing

* **Cross-Platform Engagement:** Content can be repurposed across different channels (blogs, social media, videos, podcasts) to ensure consistent engagement across platforms. This approach allows brands to reach different segments of their audience in diverse ways, maximizing the impact of their content.
   * **Example:** A brand might take a blog post, turn it into a YouTube video, and then share it as a social media post. This multi-channel approach amplifies brand reach.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Content creation** is a tool for building brand identity, boosting SEO, and establishing trust.
* **Engaging content** drives customer loyalty and increases conversions by offering value and fostering a connection.
* **Educational content** helps position brands as experts, improving customer confidence and trust.
* **Repurposing content** across platforms helps increase reach and engagement across diverse audiences.

In sum, content creation is integral to building a strong, engaging, and authoritative digital brand. When done consistently and strategically, it can accelerate growth, deepen customer relationships, and create a lasting impression in the market.",1,1735702217.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

To add to the magic of the trip, my husband had agreed I could buy my first designer bag in Paris during the trip as I turn 40 this year and we work really hard and have saved for this trip. 

I used this reddit page and others to research what I was looking for and in the end I was between a Celine 19 and a lady Dior (small). We went to the Galleries Lafayette so I could see both near each other and once I held the lady Dior I knew and then they had this beautiful dark green in stock I had not seen before and the answer was made for me. 

It was such a magical and special experience. I’ve never bought designer before so I was nervous, but the sales people were so kind and helpful and answered all my questions about the bag. They gave us coffee and water as we decided between colors and options for the shoulder strap. 

After we were done we went to the main area of the galleries and the tree started its light show at the same time. It was like out of a movie.

Great results, I feel reset, dropped 6kg (I’m sure some of that is water weight and will bounce) still a bit lethargic but very clear minded.

On the 4th night, I took myself to the movies to see Gladiator 2 - I thought it was a good distraction. At the cinema, I planned to get a bottle of water but on a stupid impulse bought a diet cola as a treat.

I took 2 sips, the first sip was heaven on my lips and I smiled like a crazy person alone in the cinema savouring it, the second sip didn’t hit the same, and I didn’t touch the rest.

To give an idea of how much two sips was, the 600m bottle was still full above the label. I barely touched it, but WOW my stomach disagreed.

By the end of the movie I was nauseous like nothing else, I hobbled to the car, got a bottle of water from a vending machine on the way and sat feeling awful in the car trying to dilute what felt like poison in my body with cold water.

It was a half an hour drive home and I pulled over twice to pull myself together. Got home, thought of ending the fast, couldn’t throw up there was nothing in my system, had a shower and went to bed.

Woke up feeling hung over and hungry, had a tea, a Panadol, and a light walk, felt slightly better, it was the last day, I made it through, broke the fast with 2 dates, a half bowl of pumpkin soup and a glass of chicken broth.

A couple days after winding off the fast and I went to a cafe, their drinks fridge is full of soda, some of which I would usually crave, but all desire was gone and the thought of putting any of that artificial battery acid in my body made me ill. It was like looking at brightly labeled chemicals. YUCK

I woke up with a head cold and was not feeling well. As I was going the the bathroom before anyone in my house woke up, my 4 year old woke up. She tells my spouse she needs the bathroom. My spouse ignores her several requests before asking our daughter where I was and to have me take her to the bathroom. I was annoyed that my spouse could not parent for 2 minutes so I could shit without being interrupted. 

Next I paid our bills and took care of other financial things. I messed up one bill and took longer then I should have needed to fix the issue so I was a little more annoyed. More at myself then anything. 

When I got downstairs my spouse was sitting on the couch play Stardew while our 4 year old ""watched"". I made coffee and got our child breakfast. I became more annoyed that the extention cord for the coffee and toaster broke so I could only do one thing at a time. I brought my spouse coffee and child breakfast. I have been grumbling to myself about the days early annoyances so I figure it was best to excuse myself and have a cup of coffee alone before joining family fun.

My spouse then grabbed me by the wrists and pushed me on the bed, stood over me shaking me by the arms. They were yelling at me for being a crazy, irrational, selfish bitch. Our child stood in doorway begging for me to be let go and left alone like I asked. My spouse stormed out of the house crying about how I am turning our child against them. 

Am I overreacting by calling that a physical attack. My spouse returned  and denied they attacked me and said they just got upset because I always act like this around my period. I know I have issues with self regulating one day a month. I excuse myself when this happens to do breathing and other exercise I have learned through years of therapy. It's an issue I've had since puberty and I have been medicated for in the past. My child tells me when I start acting different and does the breathing with me. My spouse gets frustrated at me instead. I feel like this is teaching my child good self regulation for when she gets overwhelmed but my spouse thinks it makes me a bad parent.

5. Majoy Baron - the Baroness of the block. Majoy proved that she is still the Majoy who reads opponents like a book and defending the net.

Clunky, awkward, but it was so bad it was brilliant. It was cliche ridden and the contestants, unlike today's gameshows were not selected for their photogenic appeal in front of the camera.

Jim always looked out of place compering the show and just attempted to be the contestants best mates.

"" What do you do for a living "" Dave""? "" "" I'm a plumber Jim ""

"" Ooh, you've got a funny story to tell us about being a plumber Dave ""  Cue weak, lame anecdote...

""It'll take me two minutes to count it out "" he'd say to the contestants before he went to the advert break - EVERY episode.

The script was exactly the same every week. They'd introduce a professional dart player in the middle of every episode, who's task was to score 301 in 9 darts to raise money for charity. 

"" Ooh we do know how much you like to make 301 - insert pro darts player's name - Dave/John/Whoever.

The prizes were woefully uninspiring by modern standards. A nest of coffee tables, a 9"" mini TV, a coffee maker, a fondu set, but somehow it worked. 

I was obsessed by this programme in the 1980's, so much so that I missed my train to rejoin my Army job at the time and often ended up thumbing a lift back 100 miles to make it back for work on Monday morning,  It was broadcast about 4pm on a Sunday.   
  
It was a shit show, but for me it was a captivating show that had a disproportionate effect on my life. 

And watching consecutive re-runs of this show today made me love and regret my previous obsession of it in equal measure. 

Mad, dated, but strangely compulsive.

Supposed to be meron kaming mini gathering ng friends ko every new year after ng putukan. Yesterday, may usapan kaming mag bingo tas ang prizes yung mga naclaim ko sa mga coffee shops like sb, cbtl tas meron pang electric pot cooker. For fun lang. Last year anbernic saka nintendo switch ang prizes namin.

So syempre, excited sila sa mga paandar kong ganon. Kaso may problem kami sa shop kahapon, almost 15k ang receivables na di nakarating. May customer pa na nagpacustomize ng 20pcs+ na item worth almost 5k na COD (i know, my bad, siya lang pinagbigyan na COD sa maramihan) tas magpuputukan na, pinabalik balik kami at pinaikot sa mga kamaganak nila kung sino magbabayad. So badtrip ako buong gabi.

Yung nagdeliver kasi, inabot din kahit COD dapat. So medyo may tampo ako. Alam naman nya ang policy. Kaso pinayagan nya. Ang ending pahirapan singilin yung client. And nakukulangan ako sa accountability nya, parang wala kasi. Friend ko din pala to.

So kagabi, after putukan, nagchachat na sila sa gc na bingo na daw, di ako nagseseen. Masama loob ko. Chinat ko na lang yung closest friend ko doon na wag na tayo magbingo at sa kanya na yung sb mug na gusto nya. Kasi I feel shit talaga.

Anyway, nagsibatian na ang mga bare minimum friends na lagi kong inaaya pero never napagbigyan, wala akong nireplyan kahit isa, eh nag aya jowa ko sa kanila na kesyo coffee daw or something. Sabi ko wag ka na mageffort, di naman yan sila nagrereply. Kaya nasabi nya na ang hateful ko daw.

Sabi ko, hindi ako hateful, ang hirap lang kasi mag effort sa mga friends na di ka man lang mabigyan ng bare minimum effort kahit over ka na sa kanila. Its called choosing myself pa kako.

Feeling ko ang panget tuloy ng pasok ng 2025 sakin, kasi puro poot na lang ata nararamdaman ko. Dagdag pa na di maganda ang status ng buhay ko nung 2024, tas namatay pa father ko ng biglaan.

I struggle with this issue for a long time, I am not sure how long it has been tbh, but I know that it wasnt always like this. I dont remember having such issues my armpits few years back, I mean yes i did have some odour but it wasnt that bad and It was only after a long day or something. Now I do not have to do anything and the smell comes back. I wash EVERYDAY, i even scrub my armpits, i use antibacterial soap, herbal soaps, i shave, i tried glycolic acid, magnesium, lemon, apple cider vinegar, salt water, all kinds of natural deodorants... I do sweat easily, but i noticed the smell even when its cold and i do not sweat as much. Honestly the only combination that KIND OF helped me was glycolic acid WITH castor oil, or natural deodorant WITH castor oil. it kind of worked when i stayed at home and i was lucky enough to wake up with odourless armpits. 
I dont use or want to use chemical deodorants and antiperspirants, i know that they would probably kind of help but i truly try to put as little poison in my body as i can, please do not try to change my mind or judge me for this:). 

I need to get rid of the root of the issue. 
I need to know what causes this issue, internally. If I have to explain the smell, it smells like marihuanna smoke and/or onions (i dont smoke and i dont eat many foods with spices or garlic/onions). My diet is mixed with keto/carnivore and ocassional junk food (it used to be like twice a week, im oficially over this though as i NEED to detox my body, which is self explanatory and I am strictly keto and carnivore now). 
Some stuff that might cause the issue? i truly am not sure: I drink coffee everyday. I am not overweight anymore but also not skinny, but i was overweight few months ago. i lost 24 pounds so far, i thought the issue was me being overweight but no... im still trying to lose more weight though. I also think i have higher cortisol levels, nothing too drastic but it is there. I started taking moringa 2 days ago for this. I still need to change my sleep patterns and try to meditate though. I also have some hormonal issues too, but it was WAY worse when i was a teenager. It is way better now but i can feel that its not completely gone yet. i try to work on that, all of it. I just wanna know if someone went through the same stuff like me, i dont know if its just that or if i actually might have deeper issues, like liver or kidney... 
Pls help lol, im really starting to be hopeless. any idea what could the root issue be? all of the above? something worse? what can i do? Because scrubbing and showering everyday clearly does not work. I’m so tired of being ""MUSTY"", even the word makes me feel TERRIBLE because my hygiene is on point!!!!

# Overview of Hardscape Construction

At Dynasty Pavers and Design Inc, we understand that hardscaping plays a vital role in creating a cohesive and functional outdoor space. Hardscape construction involves the installation of non-plant elements, such as patios, pathways, retaining walls, and driveways, which enhances both the aesthetic and functional qualities of your property. Expert craftsmanship ensures that these features not only look beautiful but also stand the test of time, providing you with a durable outdoor environment for years to come.

Your outdoor area should be a place of relaxation and gatherings, and our hardscape solutions can transform your vision into reality. We employ meticulous workmanship combined with quality materials to deliver outstanding results, whether you’re looking to improve your home’s curb appeal or create a welcoming retreat in your backyard.

# Key Benefits of Hardscaping

One of the primary advantages of hardscaping is its ability to enhance the functionality of your outdoor space. By incorporating durable features like patios and pathways, you can create defined areas for outdoor activities, whether it's entertaining guests or enjoying a quiet evening with family. In addition, hardscaping reduces yard maintenance by minimizing grassy areas that require regular mowing and care, allowing you more time to enjoy your outdoor haven.

Another significant benefit of hardscaping is its contribution to property value. Well-designed hardscape features can greatly increase your property’s appeal to potential buyers, making it more attractive in the competitive real estate market. By investing in quality hardscaping, you not only improve your immediate living environment but also your long-term financial investment.

# Background Information

**CAREER**

I'm currently an IT Support Specialist for a hospital here on the West Coast, California. I've been at this job for about 5 years. 2 years contracted, 3 years full-time. I have a pension (vests at 5 years FTE). Prior to that, I worked IT for GAP (yes, that one) for about 2 years. To summarize my time in this career, it's been absolutely braindead, I generally hate my job, but it's what I'm good at, so I stick with it out of a lot of fear I'll probably unpack little parts of in this post, and can elucidate on more if you ask. Anyway, the joke about IT support is that the only thing harder than getting into this career field is getting out of it. That couldn't be more true.

Personally, I'd like to go into content creation (Youtube, Twitch, etc). I actually have a lot of skillset that applies to it, but my biggest difficulty has been being consistent with it. I know I'm good at what I do because the 3 largest tries I've had with it all actually had really good footing, but I squandered those opportunities. It's ironic that the only thing I can convince my mind and body to be consistent with is the thing that I hate the most (I'm trying to see a Psychiatrist about this - feel free to ask).

In the meantime, I'm stuck resetting people's passwords, imaging laptops, and walking people through reading emails in their inbox like a first-grade teacher.

**HISTORY WITH JAPAN (Culture)**

1. Like most of you might expect, I was into anime and all of that when I was young. I specify 'young' because while I'm still a 'fan' of it now, I took put it out of my life for a period of time as I was in survival mode and I convinced myself that it was a waste of time. A little over a decade later, I got into a better (safer) position in life and rediscovered it. I definitely went through an emotional episode with it; rediscovering it like a lost love and regretting the time lost, but the reality is that the nagging in the back of my head still prevents me from fully indulging of it. So... still a fan, love everything about it, but I passively engage rather than actively. Hell, I've had a Crunchyroll subscription for the past 2 years and haven't watch an episode of anything in about 20 months. My extent of anime engagement is cons I go to and memes.

2. In my late teens, I was given a battle-scarred WW2 Japanese flag by my Grandmother as she was aware of my love for the culture. It was brought home by my great grandfather returning from the war. Never met him. No attachment to him. The flag, however, was an amazing thing to receive in my mind. Obviously, my younger obsession with Japan fueled all of this, but also... it's a flag. It's cool, ya know? I got it framed at some point, and it's been framed ever since. I recall, shortly after receiving it, having a youthful fleeting thought that I'd like to take it back to it's home one day, returning it in honor to it's country and the annals of it's history. As I've gotten older, especially in the last 2 years, this feeling has grown stronger, and I do have a very strong emotional urge to bring it back home. The politics surrounding the time period aren't important, all I know is that while the flag was given to me, it does not belong to me.

3. Similar to the flag, there is also a Wakizashi taken from the war as well that I'd like to return to the family, should I ever be able to find them. Same fleeting thought when I was young, and same stronger urge now that I'm older.

4. I've always loved and appreciated Japanese culture as a whole - respect for the ways of life, architecture, agriculture, traditions, customs, speech pathologies, etc. While I'm not some studied scholar of the country, I know my fair bit about the country; I'd argue more than most on this path that I'm on.

5. I studied Japanese for 2 years in high school. Would have been 4 years were it not for an... unhealthy, unsupportive, and racist environment I was in, but I didn't take those two years I did get for granted. Sufficed to say, aside from Katakana and Hiragana, I have no linguistic knowledge anymore and it's something I intend on changing, regardless of my future with Japan itself.

As a summary of my history with the country; while I've always appreciated and respected it, and despite my desires to return icons of it's history home, I've never had a tangible thought that I WOULD ever actually make it to Japan. I never made plans or dreamed big about it while young and on top of that, I've never had much wanderlust to begin with. I've never traveled, so maybe there's an unfound itch there that has yet to crop up, but otherwise the desire to go outside of my walls has never been there.

**FISCALS**

I currently make $77,000 a year.

I can get knee-deep into the numbers because I love this stuff but I'm going to try and reel myself in here and just summarize the fact that were I to liquidate everything I have tomorrow and pay off my remaining debts, I'd have about $45,000 cash. I'll be covering this more later.

# Rationale

So I bet you're thinking after the uncomfortably-detailed background above, you're expecting some big emotional post to rationalize the idea. Well, you are correct. Buckle your ass.

I kid... kinda. Brass tacks. Good luck!

I stumbled upon a video in July about opportunities opening in the IT field in Japan - namely in the Cloud Computing sector. While I myself don't have cloud computing knowledge (which obviously could always change), there seems to be a lot of openings for Data Center Technicians looking for English speakers. For those not in the know, this isn't a particularly glamorous job. You could consider it the plumbing of IT. No disrespect to the work itself whatsoever, but compared to my experience, skill set, and current job, it's entry level and considerably more blue-collar than white-collar; less cushy than what I have. In any case, it's absolutely a way into Japan that isn't the JET program because you couldn't put me in that field if my life depended on it (and to a degree, it could kinda be argued that my life does depend on it). I've heard plenty of horror stories about the general treatment that Western English teachers get in that country, and I know I'd just get chewed up and spat out. I give all the credit in the world to the teaching industry as a whole. All teachers everywhere are criminally unappreciated, especially here in the US.

**=======CONTEXT=======WARNING=======CONTEXT=======**

I've gone through a significant life change in the last 6 years. The story is chock full of detail that would warrant it's own separate post, so I'll spare the details (snort) unless asked or if something feels relevant. Here are the important pieces that I feel I see other posters get asked about the most.

**CAREER**

I desperately hate my job and my field. I've had thousands of hours of conversations and internal dialogue about this. I promise you that, at least in regards to my field and my day-to-day, there's nothing you can say or advice you can give me (related to my current job) that will get rid of this feeling. If you feel compelled to provide advice, I'll trust your intentions are good but I ask that you spare yourself the time and not bother with that part. While there are absolutely drawbacks to my field and the role I'm in (and a plethora of positives I'm fully aware of), I have actually come to a conclusion.

Where I'm at in life right now, with the things I've experienced, the failures I've accumulated (personal, not fiscal), and the opportunities after opportunities after opportunities that I've missed (primarily out of over-analysis), I have basically reached a point where I **cannot** see a future for myself in this country - not, ""*I'm not sure where I'm headed*"" or ""*I'm going through a rough patch*"" - no. I physically cannot conjure an image in my head of what my future looks like in this country, and I will happily provide specifics on that (not gonna leave you hangin').

**RELATIONSHIPS**

* **Partner**

I'll start with partner prospects. Again - trying to avoid politics - but I think a lot of people can agree that the dating market in the West isn't the best. It's not some hyperbolic dystopian gray-world (not yet, anyway), but it is VERY difficult to not only trust people in this country, but go through the song and dance commonly associated with Western dating. Before you judge me too hard, please hear out my reasoning why this is problematic for me because it's probably not what you're assuming.

Like a lot of young people, I - for the longest time - believed that the biggest thing holding me back from PERSONAL progress in the future in this country was gas and grocery prices and that my wage was too low. Any modicum of studying macro econ will show that that's not really the case. Once my debts were cleared (car, really - no credit cards or payday loans or any of that nonsense), it was like magic - I had money to save every month. Shocker. Despite having this extra money, I very quickly realized that I hit a hard ceiling. All the tertiary issues in my life are solved - I have good health, I have money in the bank, I'm not looking at food or gas prices, and I have a peaceful apartment... but I'm not exactly 100% fiscally comfortable. I'm already 32 and I'm kinda at the end of my career path (IT Support; not where I wanna be, but it's what I have for now and $77,000 is not bad money whatsoever), I live very frugally and while the money I save every month isn't awful, I'm ain't making any moves any time soon, at least in this country, and the only way that really changes is with a partner.

To be clear, this isn't the only (or even the primary) reason why I want a partner. I've been treated horribly by partners in the past and left to eat dust with a bloodied heart in my hand too many times (cheated on every time). As a result, I kinda stopped trying to look hard and just focus on building myself. Speaking from a health-mindset, that was 100% the correct choice. I've still wanted a partner though. That's normal, isn't it - wanting to share life with someone? Believe me, I love my solitude, but 4 years is a bit... yeesh. In any case, I'm still faced with this dilemma. With everything kinda stable in my life now, isn't this is the part of the cute story where the guy unsuspectedly stumbles into the quirky girl at a bakery with tons of bokeh in the background and bystanders in the foreground somehow having completely silent conversations as not to disturb the main character's dialogue? That was a joke, btw. Well, it isn't for lack of trying, but that just hasn't been the case for me, and I work VERY strange hours that aren't really conducive to meeting people. I've made attempts to put myself out there in terms of putting myself in situations where I could meet someone with similar interests. I go to an arcade every Sunday and I try to go to cons near me when they pop up. I'm not a drinker, so I'm certainly not gonna bar crawl, and I was never into the club scene. This boils back down to what I believe to just be a culmination of issues with dating in the West, and don't get me started on dating apps.

* **Friends**

As anyone might expect: the older you get, the harder it is to make friends. I always prided myself on making friends when I was younger because I was very good at it, however on reflection, I think I was so good at it because it was a combination of my absurdly good conversational skills and opportunities to meet people (primarily school). I reckon this is what all the 30 year-olds in my teenage life meant when they said enjoy it while it lasts because... I'm just not in frequent enough close proximity to anyone to form a bond, and all the people at my job are men in their late 30s and early 40s with families. I always try to engage with people when I go out, but people are usually in their little cliques. I've had a few engagements since I started going to the arcade, and they were super fun, but I wasn't able to get numbers or anything. It just seems like unless the friend group is a surviving group from their school life, most people just aren't wanting to expand their friend group in the West.

**HOUSING**

This is where the conversations naturally went to first when I first started floating this idea of moving to Japan a few months back., I'll make this one brief because it's boring. Apartments are expensive in the states you'd expect them to be in. So why not just move states? Because nothing really changes. The home becomes cheaper, the utilities go up, and the wage goes down. It's the same situation but with lower numbers. I have no attachment to anything here in California, but I've done extensive research, job hunting, and apartment hunting in other states and it's exactly like I say - cost of living is, on the whole, cheaper but my wage goes down to reflect that.

I've done this research for years prior to making this choice, and no option is the reasonable one to make especially considering that I have a stable career here in California that doesn't permit me to go remote out of state AND my apartment, while still expensive, is very cheap compared to my surrounding area (by like... $400, even for apartments attached to me) while also being in a safe area This is usually where I cap off this conversation by saying that sacrificing comfort and security should not be the default in the housing market, and that would be the sacrifice I'm making at this point because there is no other tangible benefit. In regards to percentage of my wage, this is the best price I'm going to get for the amount of security I have. It's not even a gated community - it's just a safe(er) neighborhood relative to what's around me. All this without even starting the conversation of moving cost itself. SEGWAY!

**RECREATION

Cat out of the bag: I'm a gamer. I self-isolate a majority of my day (also thanks to my job), and I'm generally pretty content in this solitude. However, as life has stabilized more for me, I've been trying more and more to incorporate things that expands life's palette. Look, I don't live in LA or New York or anything. I live in a pretty suburban area. There's a mall, some staple retail stores, and that's about it. I don't have much to do. In November of 2023, I started a habit of going to the arcade every Sunday. This doesn't sound like much, but it did a lot for me. It got me out of the house, it's something I enjoy doing, it puts me around other people, and it presents me with a weekly opportunity to socialize beyond my friends on Discord. I pay $10 for 1:30 hours of arcade time, and I play Initial D the whole time and try to interact with other racers. However, when this time is up, it's back to my normal... which is to say not much. I'll walk around the mall and maybe visit the DAISO store, but that's where it ends. I'd like to be encouraged to walk about more, but aside from a corner coffee shop, there's nothing tangibly unique about my area to visit, and the Mall itself is a bit out of comfortable walking range.

There are no parks. There are no hobby stores. There are no unique eateries. While my neighborhood and home provide me security, I can't deny that I'm isolated beyond my control (for the reasons listed in the housing section), and this frustrates me.

**COMMUNITY**

This is a pretty crucial one to me and actually kinda encompasses the items above. I mentioned that I have no real attachment to California. Well, the line isn't drawn there. I have a lot of difficulty attaching to my country and the culture as a whole. When wanting to stretch my social chops a bit, I'm not often met with eagerness to engage. I understand the irony of this topic considering that America is very well known for strangers being totally willing to go up to each other and speak. However, it is also known that America tends to have an ego-centric culture, so while it's very common to see people being friendly to each other, it's very rarely an at-a-whim thing with no strings attached. This doesn't inherently mean that the encounters are negative or have malicious intentions, but the motives are skewed and it's very difficult to determine someone's intent, even in a contextualized situation like helping someone.

I understand the double-irony of saying this considering the place I'm asking about moving to being Japan where honne and tatamae exists. This is a concept that exists in just about every country. I'm very familiar with it, and as someone who has a pretty strong grasp of the 5-tiered ladder of social awareness (something I love talking about), it's something I can understand. The key difference between Japan and the West is that Japan's hiding of true feelings is out of respect of the conversation and reducing social awkwardness and putting stress on the other individual to capitulate the subject. In the West, true feelings are typically hidden to avoid confrontation or out of fear of being taken advantage of, which is totally a reasonable concern, by the way. The problem that comes with this in the West, however, is that when that's the default, no communication happens at all or worse yet, communication DOES happen but it's laced with lies to misdirect. At least in Japan, everyone has the common understanding of not wanting to make things awkward (despite it kinda... diluting conversation down to almost nothing). Everyone seems to assume friendly intent, but in America, everyone assumes malice.

The proclivity of Americans to engage in random friendly conversation tends to be out of a desire to not drown in silence when sometimes silence might be the better option. But this is obviously the difference between a homogenous monoculture like Japan, and a mixed culture like America. The way I've summed it up in conversations in the past is that the issue America has with communication makes it feel like your neighbor, who is only 20 feet away, might as well be on the other side of the country as far as your relation to them is concerned. Americans isolate just like the city-bound Japanese do, but they do it out of fear and discomfort whereas the Japanese seem to do it out of contentment and convenience. As an aside, there's a very good stand-up comedy bit about this pertaining to answering the doorbell in America in the modern day compared to the 20th century.

#General Plan

This is hopefully the part where I display my competency and try to make an appeal to you, my internet peers, that I'm not going into this idea halfcocked and this decision making process hasn't been just... on a whim.

* Ideal Timeframe

My ideal timeframe from start to finish would be within a year, or by the end of 2025. Now, just to preface; I'm SUPER susceptible to the hyper-fixation problem of 'preparing to prepare' - constantly researching the perfect strategy to do something, but never doing anything with it. A big symptom of this is saying something like ""*Okay, I'm gonna do all this research and start doing things on 'X' date*"". This, for most people, is usually bad because it sets a barometer of failure. I'm the same way. However, since July, I have already enacted on getting things in order without having done the most important parts yet.

* Health

When I came to this conviction in July, the first thing I thought of was my health. I've had health insurance for the last 3 years and haven't used a lick of it - a portion of it out of fear of the process, but primarily out of laziness, I'll admit. Anyway, my goal was to get all my health stuff done by the end of the year. Why is this relevant? I'm a big dude, I really shouldn't be, and Japan has a lot of walking. In retrospect, my health should have been a consideration of mine before the Japan decision, but that's neither here nor there at this point. If you are interested though, I'm pretty much completely healthy, just overweight and my doc thinks it might have something to do with my sleep. I have a long history of insomnia since I was a kid, and I currently work a swing shift that doesn't see me going to bed until about 6am. You be the judge. I digress. I don't want to be a strain on the Japanese system. I know me as an individual won't have a large affect on the system, but I don't want to bring my problems that I should have handled myself to another country, so it only seemed appropriate.

==========**PLAN ONE**==========

* Learning

Starting in 2025, I plan on going on a 'College' schedule in terms of daily activity. I plan on trying to do 1 hour of Japanese study a day with the goal of working up to 2 or 3, I plan on going to the gym to improve the quality of my flesh prison, and lastly, I plan on using my recently acquired organizational license to Udemy Business Pro to take some tertiary courses to the field I'm trying to get into in Japan to both improve my skills and to improve my prospects of getting hired.

* Scouting Trip

I've never been to Japan, and while I'm very good at compartmentalizing foreign concepts in my head, I understand it would irresponsible of me to just uplift my life and go somewhere I've never been before. With that said, I'd probably plan for a one or two week trip in March. My goal with this trip would primarily be to engage with the public transit system and tour the locations I'd be trying to get hired at.

* Fiscals

I plan on selling everything except my computer and my art. My pension will cash out because it's not vested. I intend on using about $10,000 to plant roots in Japan, and the remaining $40,000-ish would be left here in American accrual systems. From there, I would use whatever I make from my new job to support my life in Japan. I plan on seeing a investment lawyer about this so I can see what options will be available to me and how this will play out while living in a different country.


==========**PLAN TWO**==========

* Learning

Similar to plan one, I'd start studying Japanese immediately while I still remain on US soil, but plan two would instead see me go to Japan, as soon as possible, as a language student for 6 months to a year depending on...

* Fiscals

I was only made aware of this path very recently. It just wasn't something I considered at all because leaving a job to go jobless for anything longer than 3 days as a 32 year old man scares me. From very brief research into tuition, I'd be planning on $20,000 to $30,000 for a year, and that scares me. That could be an over estimate or an under estimate. My research on this plan is very underdeveloped right now. And naturally, as a consequence of a more accelerated plan like this, I'm unsure about the prospects of a...

*Scouting Trip

Considering the cost it would be to board in Japan as a student, I don't know if I could afford a preliminary scouting trip. While the obvious point of the language school route naturally teaching me about Japan and providing me opportunity to scout applies here, the downside is that if that's my purpose, then it becomes a $20,000-$30,000 scouting trip if I end up not liking it (which I can't imagine being the case) instead of a few thousand dollars instead.

As a side note, if anyone has information on it, I'd be interested in hearing opinions on going to the country as a student for a year to learn Japanese before getting into the work force. I've heard this is the best 'naturalization' path and tends to ease people into the experience.

#FINAL SUMMATION AND RATIONALE BEFORE YOU RESPOND

Having this be a separate section is necessary because with all of the previous context in mind, I can provide you the culmination of my rationale. Let's review and address some things you're probably thinking about.

1. **Career & Plan 1:** I am fully aware of the dangers of leaving a relatively stable career. It's something I've juggled a lot in this thought process because, for me specifically, I have been a slave to the fear around my job, and it has caused me to stagnate. I fully understand I'd be making less and that work culture in Japan is significantly different. To that, the only thing I can say is that I'd be working for a Western-styled company (FAANG's) and there's a chance I can retain some of the culture that makes work life relatively bearable in this states.

2. **Partner:** I am fully aware that I'm not going to suddenly fall into a relationship when I walk off the plane. I am also fully aware of the issues with relationships in that country. It's something I've been fascinated with and something I've looked into a lot, even previously to this decision, because it has a lot to do with human sociability and it's just... a cool (but sad) topic to learn about. In any case, I still want to apply myself when getting into any relationship. I'm not expecting some quick turnaround.

3. **Friends & Community: ** I am fully aware that I'm not suddenly going to have a satisfying amount of friends when I walk off the plane. Not only are the big cities in Japan some of the most socially isolated, but that honne and tatamae is taken to the Nth degree compared to Rural Japan. Moving to Japan will not suddenly fix all of my social issues that I encounter with making new friends, in fact, I will likely encounter new ones.

4. **Housing:** I am fully aware that my argument for housing seems pretty much the same when considering Japan - cheaper cost of living and my wage goes down, so how is Japan any different than my argument for not moving to other states? Necessity of a car.

So, with me acknowledging the above problems; what's my angle? What's my big rationale?

# **Paradigm Shift**

Soapbox time!

As I said earlier in the post in the career section, I cannot see my future in this country. I can't even imagine a figment, but it's because it's more than just my job causing that.

In a vacuum one or two of the issues I brought up could be reasonably addressed at once. It'd be exhausting and a hard fought conclusion, but it could probably be done. As of right now, however, and for the foreseeable future, I have no feasible recourse to resolve all of these issues. If you want the yucky answer to my own introspection, the most immediate thing that could help start alleviating my issues is a partner because having a partner would free up both money and time.

As of right now, here is my situation: IT in the West is undergoing a very tumultuous shift. A lot of the COVID hires are starting to be let go because companies are realizing they over-hired. With the worst behind us, they can reduce those costs and they actively are. In my job, a hospital IT support line, despite us losing 6 people within the last year alone, we've only replaced 2 and don't intend on hiring more. Everyone is strained as a result, and we're all death-gripping our positions right now; not because we're at risk of losing them, but because they're very hard to acquire. As a result, I can't really explore getting out of this awful sect of IT into maybe something else. I've researched this. My own organization doesn't have open positions in other departments. Leaving for another job in the **Western** market specifically is a gamble.

Because I'm stuck in this current position, I'm locked into strange hours. The cruel irony of these swing shift hours, however, is that they fixed my horrible sleep issues that had gone resolved for 25 years until I got this shift 3 years ago. Years of medical intervention did nothing. Who figured a shift change would be so drastic? To the point, however, I'm unable to mingle with the normal masses except on my days off - for both friend and partner prospects. Even with those days off, there isn't actually much recreation to do here. I'm exceptionally limited.

So, naturally, the last thing I considered was moving... except for the issue I mentioned with the market previously **plus** the cost of moving with no guarantee of any difference. It's throwing away money.

So how does Japan solve all of these things? Well, it doesn't... not of the rip, anyway. To hopefully convince you that I'm not under some delusion, let me spell it out for the people in the back:

# **Japan will not solve my problems. I'm merely swapping one set of problems for another.**

Japan is not the land of milk and honey. It's not some uwu anime paradise. It's not some place for foreigners with main-character syndrome to go live out fantasies. It's a complex place with it's own complex culture and complex issues. On the world stage, however, it's a place that I've observed take more tangible steps towards solving it's own problems than I have other countries, including my own. It's solutions aren't perfect, and more issues arise every day than it likely solves every day. However, I have more confidence in my ability to thrive in a culture built on respect for the minds, spoken words, and spaces of it's neighbors.

Sure, are there some sappy reasons I repeat in my head why I want to go despite what others in this thread might say? Absolutely. I'm not shy about it.

* I want to be apart of something greater, and it seems like the Japanese, for all the faults the country may have, are at least eager to try and keep it afloat (no pun intended).
* Yeah, it is kinda the birthplace of the pop culture that defined my teenage life. I think it'd be cool to indulge in that a little after putting it off for so long.
* I think there's something modest about the country's desire to be business-centric and encourage and maintain walkable cities. I'd like to be a part of that vision.

I could name more, but the thing ultimately pushing me to this idea **NOW** at the age of 32 despite it never having done so before, even when I was arguably more active in consuming Japan's culture in the past, is that I'm in a place where I want to make a change in life, I **CAN** make a change in life, and I catch myself reminiscing on the times I can count on two sets of hands that I bypassed opportunities to make a jump. I've come to terms that a lot of the opportunities I missed, I can no longer capitalize on. I've put those to bed. However, I want to believe that I'm more cognizant of my position in life now than I've ever been, and that there's a reason why my finger failed clicking off the video giving me this idea in the first 8 seconds like it was prepared to do.

I'm not spiritual. I don't believe in fate or destiny. But I'd be a damn liar if I said the signs I've been receiving since watching that video weren't making me quirk an eyebrow, and I have received many. With my life history, I'm someone that should be easily susceptive to cognitive bias, but I'm either dense or blind because If I wasn't seeing signs before, I sure am now.

#But...

I leave my decision in your trusty hands, /r/movingtojapan.

I've done hundreds of hours of research, but the only real answer I can get is from people who know.

So, with that said, here are my main...

#Questions!

1. My main question is if this does end up being a reasonable choice to make, is plan one or plan two ideal?

Plan one secures employment immediately, but as a result of jumping from one corporate culture to the next, you're likely not going to be afforded a lot of integration time in the first few months as you adjust, and I've heard this is very rough period because it's breakneck.

The arguments I've heard for plan two is that for those wishing to naturalize more quickly, going into school is the best route because you're more or less setup to crash into other students and natives allowing you to not only learn the language quicker, but have easier access to the inner culture of Japan and taking your first steps. This is obviously the more costly option, however.

It NYE and I am a single, late 30s guy posting on r4r. I am clearly the coooooooolest and eveyone wants to hang out with me! No. I am not celebrating the New Years with frozen pizza…..

Let’s get some things out of the way. I am an atheist. I don’t want kids or to be a step dad.  I am fairly left leaning. I am not a communist or socialist, but I’ve been called it. I am a very bad texter. I often text back in between activities so I tend to be brief. I am more of a voice chatter.

So let’s get to it. I am single. I would like to unsingle. This is reddit and I don’t think this will happen here. However. Nice fun conversation is something that could happen. That’s great. 

I am tragically boring and mediocre person. I know I am suppose to sell myself on how cool I am but……….. I’m not. [Insert Giggles] You know what, I am damn proud of it. Took me a lot of work to get my 3.0 at a mid tier college so I can work my regular job at my cube farm. Not everyone, can be as cool as Elon. Joking. I am joking. I have played DnD, not joking. I often un-ironically think, “I am too old for this.” I even own one of those daily pill organizers. I swear I am 39. I checked. I am bad at math, but I am not THAT BAD at math. I hope. I am guilty of being a typical millennial male in which I have done these things in a cringe way; done stand up comedy, played in a metal band, thought I was cool for being a gamer and many more. Just ask! I don’t care much for sushi and I dislike IPAs. Look, I don’t hate sushi, I’ll go and I’ll be happy. I never crave it and would choose to just go get a sandwich. I do like my lightly roasted coffees though. Oh goddammit. I am DRINKING a light roast brew as I write this. I am a ham burger enthusiast. I have never seen Breaking Bad or the Wire.

Currently my life is busy. I work and I am a bit of a workaholic at the moment because I am trying to make changes, and advances to my current career. Maybe even a career change. I am also trying to change my living situation. So a lot of my energy is directed at be productive. I am not a die -hard workaholic in which this is my complete lifestyle. I am just trying to make changes. However. I do like to “work” at things. I get deep into hobbies and subjects. I am investing heavily into my health by working out regularly and eating better. I am really looking to increasing my physical activity. I feel as I age, fitness is more critical.  All I want for my future, at this moment, is to work at a job I enjoy, and to be healthy. Yes. My schedule is stacked. I do want to and like to, take time from being productive to spend time with friends and to do fun things. 

What are fun things I like doing? As I hope to draw this workaholic phase to a close soon I would like to start a Punk Rock band, establish a marijuana farm and spend more time at the climbing gym. I am totally lying. I am not that cool. I used to spend a lot of time at galleries and museums when I was in college and I really miss doing so. I feel very fortunate to live on the west coast and I should go out and experience more for this region. I would really like to get more politically involved. I participate in election canvassing this past election and I feel like need to do so again and participate in a greater degree. I want to get into the performing arts. I want be in a play at least once. I am embarrassingly under-read and I want to read more. 

Lets hit the controversial malarkey. Atheist. Very atheist. I never lost the faith, because I never had it to begin with. I am  not spiritual either. I don’t even know what it means to be spiritual. Politically, I really care about the environment, infrastructure, limiting the power and influence of the rich, and education. I don’t think Elon is or was cool. Not wanting to be a parent is pretty self explanatory?  You don’t have to aligned with me on these ideas. I am pretty open and accepting. I just want to put it out there for those who find this important. 

What am I looking for here? Conversation would be a nice start, especially over voice chats. See my bad texter comment. If you ever hang out with me I promise to bake you cookies.",1,1735699508.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1hqu0an,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1hqu0an/costco_wrapped_year_two_at_the_food_court/,Costco Wrapped - Year Two at the Food Court,"My wife and I were wondering how often do we get a Costco Food Court number that we have had before but have no idea so the past two years I decided to collect the data and here are the results for year two!

Link for Year 1 Results: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yvxgq/costco\_wrapped\_a\_year\_at\_the\_food\_court/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/18yvxgq/costco_wrapped_a_year_at_the_food_court/)

In the time between 1/1/2024 to 12/31/2024 we went to Costco Food Court 140 times, on average returning every 2.66 days. (Up from last years 2.77). In that time, we received 12 duplicate numbers: 124, 152, 251, 305, 378, 492, 588, 625, 659, 755, 916, and 973. We got our first duplicate of the year (152) on March 7th. The quickest time between getting a number for the first time and having the duplicate was only four days after when we got 305 for the first time March 12th and four days later got it again. The longest period between duplicates was 251 which we first received on January 24th but didn’t see again until December 4th, a whole 315 days later. Our final duplicate of the year was 973 on December 13th which is also the highest number we got this year. Most importantly 916 has the honor of being the only number we received three different times this year, 1/28,  4/21, and 6/2!

We had three runs of three numbers: 669, 670, 671, 672, 350, 351, 352, and lastly 001, 002, and 003. In our hunt for number 1 it took us 637 days going all the way back to last year before we were finally able to get it. Costco officially labelled us their #1 customer! It was a total accident and our order was a coffee and two cookies.

Now you may be thinking, that is way too much Costco and we are aware. We visited a Costco on 38% of the days of the year and going that often we still only received 12.8% of the possible (999) numbers. Counting the numbers we got last year we have only seen 23% of all possible order numbers. The longest we went without going to a Costco is 8 days. Even when we go on vacation we typically stop in for gas and to use their clean bathrooms. We visited 5 different Costcos this year on our travels including Juneau, Alaska the smallest Costco in the world. Unfortunately they don't give numbers there but it was still really fun to visit! Many of these travel days also turned into what we called double Costco days. (morning coffees, and lunch or dinner later) We ordered from the food court twice on 9 different days last year.

You may be wondering how many hot dogs and pizzas did we consume in our madness? My wife and I ate 137 hot dogs, 51 peperoni pizza slices, 3 cheese pizza slices, 2 chicken bakes, 12 turkey sandwiches, 1 chicken sandwich, 104 coffees, 12 smoothies, 2 chocolate ice creams, 14 cookies and 2 soda cups! Adding all that up it leaves us with tax included at just over $860 spent at the food court this year. My wife had a small heart attack when I told her this lol.

Here is the monthly breakdown of our visits just for this year.  


|Months|Visits|Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|01/2024|11|8%|
|02/2024|8|6%|

|11/2024|14|10%|
|12/2024|18|13%|
|Sum|140|100%|

As you can see our least visited month was February while December was our most visited month.

  


|Value|Count|Percentage|

|800-899|12|9%|
|900-999|17|12%|
|Sum|140|100%|

I was also curious which numbers we get most often however it was interesting to see the spread being fairly balanced.

Lastly the total of all our Costco numbers was 73,069! (Total with last year 135,208)

The amount of coffee bean imports reached an all-time high of 176,000 tons in 2020. Koreans' workaholism is also interpreted as a factor driving coffee consumption. Coffee imports in 2022 are expected to be the highest ever, reaching $1.3 billion, up 42.4% from the previous year. Coffee imports in 2021 reached $916.48 billion, a whopping 12.7 times higher than in 2001. It is said that Korean adults drink 353 cups of coffee in 365 days.

I’ve been using the La Marzocco at work for years but have never had my own machine. Now that I do, I’m wanting to make some changes to make it feel a bit more like the machine I’m used to. I’m currently waiting for the Shades store to reopen after the Holidays to order a TopBox to get a PID, dimmer and pressure gauge. In the meantime I’m doing pretty well just temp surfing to pull reasonable shots.

The thing I’m really struggling with is the steam wand. The wand on the LM can pivot and swivel allowing more freedom of movement to find the angle that gets the milk really rolling. I’m just having such a hard time getting consistent results with the tiny, inflexible wand on the GCP.

I’ve seen that you can get the Rancilio Silvia v3 wand to work with the machine, but haven’t found a guide that I’ve confidently been able to follow on installing everything. The best I’ve found is [this post](https://www.coffeeforums.co.uk/threads/gaggia-classic-rancilio-silvia-v3-steam-wand-upgrade-with-pics.17884/) on coffee forums uk which does go in to extreme detail, but leaves me a bit uneasy in terms of sourcing parts and whatnot.

I'd like to have discussions or have some talks on partnerships. I'd love to further my knowledge base. I have a feeling what i want to do i just won't be profitable. 

  
Let just start with this. This post has a couple sections.

1.) Reality: Negative/Positive

2.) Options: To dos 

3.) Could be

4.) My exp



1.) Reality

NEG (it's short and please continue reading. I can be pathetic sometimes <insert tism remark here>)

There is only so much to say here before truth at scale is revealed. Dropshipping has lost its luster. Due to those tightening the grip on newcomers into the industry. Preventing the competition. Typical.  You won't make profit unless you're seeing the full side from the service provider. Who makes the product, ships it, with full customization for themselves because their cashflow is better than yours....(ya po boi.) To offering you a limited at scale option for subscriptions. From recent experiences and towards other individuals. There is a gap for impartial support in the market of dropshipped goods. If one were to collab and create it. I'm certain it'd make some decent profits. (Maybe I'd like to do it with all of you folks.) I keep finding false info on what rhymes with something-ify products. People create apps to assist in the new comer start ups. However, they need to be profitable. To which they really aren't that profitable. They too have their own store similar to yours you're subscribing to build. They create huge social followings and market profitability from selling a sub to you. Ofc they would it's why you are the product they're selling. Themselves to you, you to them. They are the product and so are you. They sell your product and theirs. You sell just yours. (Caught you skipping lines) Remember that. If you want to start a product and want a turn key style business. Dropshipping is no longer it. Its full of some OSS-style consumer science experts. What was used to assist in the distribution industry of all products has succumbed to the Ecommerce trend of sub, build, run ads and forget. This industry is truly more than that. I've found that if you want to start somewhere due to the hard economic chains the wealthy has placed on all of us through their barriers is becoming the same through the nature of the dropshipping community. The buy in for business to be able to compete and get beyond this dystopic inflationary tale of rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. \^\^\^\^\^You must offer a real product or service.\^\^\^\^\^ What do i mean? You can't offer something so easy or small. Ecom and dropshipping was created to assist or test products in the market. It's turned into its own industry. Its not its own industry. Thats why its hurting you. the industry is attached economically to the belts of the big guys offering what you could do. However, its their packaging and their logistics team sending your stuff out. Think you'll be any form of comeptition? You wont' make a big enough coin purse to evolve that's how its designed. It's so niche, for testing, to take money from the (dipshyts) in the mean time. You're the product to sub to their business and they just fulfill orders. It's not real partnerships. How are you profiting and them as well? With current market trends and huge price increases quarterly due to inflation and cost of goods and super cruel partnership agreements there are only so many industry leaders who have a footprint to actually assist you in your start up at a very tiny remote way. That means they know you don't have options. Like you sub to their online service would not ever turn a profit. It wouldn't. it's designed to create entrepreneurs by selling education and dreams on social media then when it gets down to their side of the sales funnel you purchase the subscription and you can't even get pass their marketing through you. Packaged by, sold by, created by, produced by. They package your stuff with their info on the bag or box so it doesn't ever look like yours. They offer terrible packaging for you product, while they package better on theirs. They could find your client base and go ahead and undercut you by securing your customers by your interaction styles. is it corporate espionage? Not really because they're you're partners i guess. They can just data mine you and your efforts. They see what works and they just give you a harder fight to be successful because they're the competition. 



POS

Not everyone in the market is like this. Only key contributors who produce massively at scale and sometimes they don't even know they're doing such a thing. The real intent is to provide services and turn an extra profit. They want to offer goods or services since they lack in other skills or cannot reach a economic goal yet due to their notoriety, renown being low, maybe the product hasn't matured for their brand on its life cycle or whatever reason beyond just screwing you because if you don't make money they don't either, some other skills they may lack could be marketing, idealism, promotion, advertising. However, they also, wish to not take a risk for D2C such as you. Like i said earlier the Ecom game is to test products but has become it's own thing. Sometimes it is more risky to have a direct to consumer style business. If they do the heavy lifting and make your job easier than they earn and you earn. However, sometimes the cost of these actually exceed the profitable means to offer you the service because really your time is harder invested into get the customers. They have built their assembly line, all they need is to print labels for the 10 different options for their product offered per their subscription. Then ship it. I mean that is a positive. Easy for them, easy for you. Yet there is something missing. At scale options for alot of products to sell. i mean for US based manufacturers for ecom and dropshipping. Maybe you could fill that void. 



2.) Options: 

What're the options? Well something-ify is a good option and so are the other 10 websites that offer you rthe same thing. They want you to do great. Everyone has a niche stake in you doing well. What can you do to actually do well...........What can you do? Maybe, email them to discuss a footprint of something real. Ask how to go from ecom style dropshipping to a actual good producer or service provider and offer them a stake in equity within your business. Based upon the saturation of valuation of your style o fbusiness and provoke a real partnership. Now, they can expand their abilities through you and you can expand yours as a real manufacturer. You could also have more clarity about the business style with them. Speak thoroughly and concisely to profits. Describe your issues and try to navigate their ability and make them feel you're actually engaging in business with them as a subscriber. Make them feel like they have work to do. Why? because they have work to do and you're not the product you're a subscribed partner. Record email chains. Make reviews thorough on the companies you go with at all of the professional platforms. Make them acknowledge your issue and existence if they stiff you. request market statistics with a greed upon partnership in contract. Make them feel like what they offer is a guarantee beyond just the subscription and legally feel obligated to help or you may litigate them. If they're promoting you can blah, blah, blah and you don't? who's lying here? you must also commit to your due diligence. not just spend 20 minutes setting a store with AI and use a week of all social media platforms to advertise. Like what're you 16 and horny. Just want to get to the action and fight whoever made you feel bad? Commit. time isn't commitment. You'll know when you created the best website, product etc for those who desire or need it. If it's a money issue. Just relax. This takes time. I am sorry they didn't tell you. Maybe you could do it in a hour. I think the stats may not be in your favor though. Just continue working hard. Don't get played. You're not hustling. You are operating. You are not doing a side business. You are conducting a real business. I hope maybe even this post bring others to you to help. 



TO DOs: 

Leave to Ecom alone or become friend with it

Bring in a group of friend and try to offer them equity by deals etc and use their extra time to help you grow

leave those reviews on everything

show your work don't suffer in silence, take criticism

stack a couple bands them try a real market approach

there is so many websites you could use to help you start or continue. I'd say some but i don't want to be outwardly bias yet. Plus it's just more subscriptions because they found a solution to a problem you'd have trouble with or wouldn't know how to solve if they were not there.

Make it legit. Try and go the full 9 yards of ammo. Do the LLC. Do the branding. Do the banking etc. Leave a footprint. Make your existence known. Don't cheese dyck it fkn rtrd. 

or cheese dk it and enjoy that leaning tower of cheezah duuuuude whoooooooooaaawwwwww (little cartoon culture from back in the day)

  
3.) What Could Be: 

Well what could be done? Nothing, you aint shyt tbh. you can't fight this. Only with your ability as a consumer could you fight this. Use your dollar to your advantage. You could also use the systems they use to promote themselve against them. Indeed, BBB, Google reviews, forums, etc right? Wrong, it'd show how unprofessional you can be because you entered business as a individual and not as a business man. Just kidding, didn't that sound competitive? duh, thats the point. We need that 1990s female with curly hair, pearl/big gold ear rings in her 30s with a check book validating her deals with accountability back on the block. Back when couches were white/ grey with floral designs and light stained oak was standard accents. Make them feel the accountibilty. Make the service provider know they have to change. Why? They won't make any money if we do it together right?



4.) My Exp:

Let me start by saying thank you for reading for this long. You could leave now. The fact you still are reading makes me feel valued even if i don't know you're reading. Means my perspective was analyzed and received. Please don't give up on business or ecom. There is real deals and great opportunity out there. Mine just dried up is all. The only way to make real money is like this: Your friend and you start this together. You do the website and your friend does the dropshipping providing. Use each others times. Switch roles here and there and see what you would love to do. Test your business ability with those you respect via ethics of work and craftsmanship. The exp i had was big issues with actually profiting from using the services provided to me. Even if i was the cheapest about it. I couldn't turn a profit. I'd lose customers due to shipping times, loss to branding that wasn't mine on packaging, loss due to expense of acquiring the conversion was too high. With out a huge online Prescence to compliment your new business you really can't make it that way. Take a massive amount of time. These are all tools to help already existing businesses to get their products to their customers. What provoked me to make a post so controversial or to create a avenue of discussion to settle such issues. I built a few stores for ecom. I did my diligence. I forgot one thing. The probability factors with COAS. My cost of acquisition was so high I was confused how I'd become such a business. Like this would never work. It was true. Unless I became my own manufacturer. I'd not see anything. Now, if I opened 2. stores and launched a huge scheme of marketing for each store and funded it well and made sure my coas for conversion was solid I'd probably have a somewhat livable wage. Wrong, anyway I looked at it.... from acquiring services or goods etc. There is no real way to profit anymore. I was using shopify. I was using prebuilt themes and I did my diligence. I used great .csv files. I even made some seriously good ones. I just wanted to profit enough so i can have enough money to open a lease agreement with the local plaza to start a coffee shop in my local town. My credit isn't the best and tbh, the blue collar work isn't even enough to keep money in the pocket anymore due to the fat bald dudes in VA destroying the budgets. Well, my purchasing power is gone and I am just trying to make ends meet. I discovered that even the (side)Businesses are set up for failure. From miscommunication, bad marketing, bad products being offered to the packaging etc. All of these people from their Apps are just doing what you're doing. They want to have a turn key investment. Well I've learned my lesson. I won't be using this style of business anymore. My money was taken and I won't get it back. Guess I'll just work until i can afford a small business. Even though reits and ETFs are going to destroy my child's future. I will at least run mine into old years of working and offer them at least something worth some sort of freedom. God knows Americxa is free but for some crazy reason we are all wage slaves taxes over 50% every year but if we enact any of our rights we are deemed horrible people. This isn't the country i was told I was in as a child. anyways, sorry about that. I used alot of apps... here they are....avoid them...two main ones and I certain you can imagine the others. If there is a comment or a bunch, I'll go into detail about which ones etc. Just long post

Shopify

dripshipper

all apps to deal with merch and coffee products

all apps to deal with making your store convenient(if you get any apps your store is slow af, how they make you upgrade to a expensive membership) 

  
If you made it this far you probably know I was a bit diligent. If you'd like, I want to seek business partners and new opportunities. I just don't know how to evolve from my blue collar circle. I could be a great addition for marketing if you'd offer me livable wage. Also good in the tech sector. I was cyber with no certs in the jarhead clan of things.

1hqty4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hqty4h/how_to_teach_15mo_not_to_hitbang/,How to teach 15mo not to hit/bang,"I could use some advice. We're trying to teach our 15mo not to do two things: (1) bang things on tables and (2) hit mommy in the face 😂

She has always loved banging things together or on tables. She loves to make noise, period. But now it happens a lot on our coffee table and at mealtimes, which is loud, disruptive and bad for the furniture.

And then there's her habit of hitting me in the face 😂 it's always playful, not angry or spiteful, but I really want her to learn that this isn't ok. (She does it to my husband sometimes too, but I think pregnancy and breastfeeding have taught her that my body and by extension my face are her personal property 😂 so 9 times out of 10 it's my face)

Anyway, for the most part we've been firmly saying ""no"" twice and if she does it a third time, we take whatever it is (toy, cup, mommy) away for a little while. But now she's learned that banging things on tables is a good way to get attention, so recently we've started turning away and ignoring her for a few moments instead. That generally stops the behavior in the moment but she still tries banging things to get attention so idk if it's really sinking in. 

I've ordered several books on parenting toddlers but I'm not sure if they'll have advice for kids as young as her, so if you have methods that have worked for you, I'd love to hear them. Non-punitive methods only, please.

A while back for some reason my scary adventure story came up at a counselling session, thus:  
Some time between Covid lockdowns, I was alone at work, carrying stuff into a shipping container used for storage. Just at the moment I stepped inside -BAM!- before you could say “reportable workplace incident,” the door shut behind me. I was trapped before I could prop the door open with the plank I kept just inside the door, the first thing I would usually do...for safety. At first I thought maybe somebody sneaked up behind me and shut me in as a bad taste prank.  
Pretty soon I had to face the fact that if someone *had* locked me in, they weren’t coming to say “ha ha, only joking” any time soon. In retrospect, it must have been a freak gust of wind which slammed that heavy door shut.  
I banged on the walls for a while (with my safety plank) and shouted for help, hoping someone might hear me. I knew that occasionally people walk past on their way around the worksite, but I had to make a noise at the right time for somebody to be in earshot. When would that be? I would only hear them go past if they spoke, or trod heavily. Every hour or so I banged and yelled for a while.  
I had no food or water. There was a light in there, but the management had recently removed an internet connected laptop I once had inside, so no communication link to outside.  
I entered just after I had my 10am coffee to boost my work performance. Uh oh, how long could my bladder hold out? I held on for as many hours as I could... but eventually, I had to pee. Terrified that somebody might open the door at that embarrassing moment, I peed on a box of old newspaper like a puppy. Now things were serious- if I did get rescued I would have to try and get rid of the litterbox as unobtrusively as I could. I knew if I was found dead in there the pee would hardly matter, but oh god, please don’t let me have to do the other thing, (the shameful thing,) in case I do get out alive!  
The whole time, I knew perfectly well that I **could** die a lingering painful death in there, but then again perhaps I **could** be rescued the next moment. So hysterical panicking might be wildly unnecessary, or then again, it might be entirely warranted. Whenever you read about people who were trapped for a while, then rescued, as well as those who were trapped and found too late, that’s how the first day must be for them.  
I became dehydrated and a bit dizzy. I knew there was a co-worker due to come in 2 days, but what if he didn’t come??? He was elderly, what if he got sick?  
I had signed the visitors book at the security gatehouse that day. I hoped somebody might check at the end of the day and see that I hadn’t signed out again. There’s only a handful of signatures in that book each day, if they even glanced it would be obvious. But no.  
People who live alone like me can die long before anybody raises the alarm, a fact I was acutely conscious of the whole time I was inside. I didn’t need a Wells Fargo incident to heighten my awareness. I do have one friend, who did phone my home that night, but how was he to know I never made it back that day? How many days before he would suspect something was wrong?  
When I saw through the crack in the door that it was dark outside, I stopped bothering to shout. I got cold, so cold. Luckily it was a mild night but still, I only had a tshirt on. (I had taken off my compulsory high vis vest when I got too hot that morning, so I was asking for it really.) I tried to wrap myself up in newspaper & sheets of cardboard to keep warm, and get a few spells of sleep, but inevitably I had to get up often and walk around to keep warm.  
I remember dozing, and having the crazy dreamthought “if only I could slip out back to the office for a moment and get some water to bring back here, then I wouldn’t be so thirsty while I wait to be rescued.”  
\*\*\*  
The terrifying noises at night went bump… tap tap tap… screee-eeee-eeek. Presumably bird feet on the metal roof, and the scratching of tree branches, but of course it sounded like a creepy psycho murderer with knives, and would have even more so without a light on; I would undoubtedly be in a straitjacket now.  
\*\*\*  
Finally,  
after 24 hours,  
a passing forklift driver heard my periodical banging and yelling for help. My hero! He was pretty shocked.  
If he hadn’t heard me, well, another lockdown was instigated 2 days later, and nobody from my organisation was allowed on site for months!  
After I told my counsellor this saga, she said “oh my god, were you traumatised?” and I replied, no, not really. She asked “well, why not?”  
and I told her truthfully:  
***it’s because that’s the least of my problems,***  
and we both laughed :D :D :D

I am originally from the mainland where I didn’t have this equipment and space is more abundant. Since arriving in Hawaii in 2015, I’ve basically just piled this stuff on the lanai. I am moving to a place with a smaller lanai which means if I do this there, I won’t even be room to sit and have a coffee.

I don’t want to put it in my bedroom closet due to lack of space there and also, the dirt and sand.

My building has no storage lockers or anything external to the unit. 

I was hoping to find a utility cabinet or something… maybe a creative way to hang it from the lanai ceiling?

Prompt: Make the most unhinged, stupid, crazy ai Batman script. Make it obviously ai and make it completely stupid.

Here is what it responded with: 

Scene 1: Batman’s Batcave

(The Batcave is a giant, endless room with a Batcomputer that's powered by a literal tornado of bats. Batman is sitting at the Batcomputer, staring intently at a screen that shows a picture of a pizza. Alfred stands behind him, holding a massive sandwich made entirely of bread.)

Batman (monotone, emotional):
Alfred… I think the pizza… is trying to communicate with me.

Alfred (confused):
Master Wayne, that's… just a pizza. It’s from Domino's.

Batman (slightly twitching):
No, Alfred. It's not just any pizza. It's THE pizza. The one that will decide the fate of Gotham. The one with pineapple.

Alfred (sighs):
Right. And I assume you’ve already stared at it for 17 hours and 42 minutes?

Batman (suddenly standing up and shaking violently):
ALFRED! THE PINEAPPLE IS A LIE! I KNOW THE TRUTH! WE’VE BEEN EATING IT ALL WRONG!

(He slams his fist on the Batcomputer, sending a shockwave through the cave that causes a statue of a bat to fall on top of a giant rubber duck.)

Scene 2: The Streets of Gotham

(Meanwhile, on the streets of Gotham, the villain known as The Taco is wreaking havoc. He is throwing tacos into the air, and they are somehow exploding into fireworks. Batman watches from a nearby rooftop, but it’s hard to take him seriously because he’s wearing a full-body bat suit that also has a cape made of cheese.)

Batman (whispering to himself):
I have to stop this… but I can’t do it alone. I need… The Batman Emergency Support Hotline.

(He pulls out a tiny phone the size of a flea and dials the number. The phone rings exactly one time before a random voice picks up.)

Voice on the phone (excitedly):
Hello! You've reached the Batman Emergency Support Hotline! How can I assist you in saving Gotham today?

Batman (distracted by a squirrel on a nearby building):
I need your help. A taco-themed villain is exploding tacos all over Gotham. I need... a plan.

Voice (pauses, then confidently):
Absolutely, Batman. I have the perfect solution! You need a… really big spoon.

Batman (gritting his teeth):
A spoon?

Voice (enthusiastically):
Yes! A spoon! But wait—there’s more! You need a spoon with a jet engine attached to it. That way, you can scoop up the tacos at superspeed, saving Gotham from Taco Armageddon.

Batman (nodding to himself):
Of course… The Spoon of Fate.

Scene 3: The Battle with The Taco

(Batman arrives in the Batmobile, which is now also a giant pizza delivery car. The car’s engine roars, and it transforms into a giant flying taco. Batman jumps out, wielding a spoon with a jet engine on it. The Taco villain is standing there, dramatically tossing tacos into the air, oblivious to Batman’s imminent arrival.)

The Taco (laughing maniacally):
You can’t stop me, Bat-man! No one can stop THE TACO! They’ll all bow to the power of my guacamole!

Batman (dramatic, cheese cape billowing in the wind):
You underestimate the power of... a spoon.

(He activates the jet engine, and the spoon immediately launches into the air with the force of a thousand exploding burritos. Batman begins to scoop up the tacos, throwing them into a massive, self-replicating taco dimension portal that he summoned by accident.)

The Taco (screaming in horror):
NOOO! YOU CAN'T JUST SCOOP MY PLANET AWAY!

Batman (smiling smugly):
You forgot, Taco. Gotham doesn’t do tacos. We do pizza. And even then, we question the pineapple.

(The portal closes. The tacos disappear. Gotham is saved.)

Scene 4: Batman Returns to the Batcave

(Back in the Batcave, Batman is sitting, eating a sandwich made entirely of bread. Alfred watches him with a look of quiet despair.)

Alfred (muttering):
What have we done? Is this the world we’ve created?

Batman (slamming his sandwich down):
No, Alfred. This is the world we saved. The Taco was just a distraction, but the real enemy was... the pineapple pizza conspiracy.

(A dramatic pause. Batman looks out into the distance as thunder cracks. A crow flies by, but it’s wearing sunglasses.)

Batman (whispering):
I’ll be ready for the next attack. The spaghetti cult. They’re coming. And this time… I won’t let them get away with putting spaghetti in the coffee machine.

Alfred (exasperated):
Master Wayne… You do realize, you’ve been sitting in the Batcave for 36 hours eating nothing but bread, right?

Batman (smiling devilishly):
Yes, Alfred. But bread... is the future.

(Cue dramatic music. Fade to black. The credits roll with a list of 50 random objects and a text that says, “Directed by AI.”)

THE END



**Story two:**

Title: BATMAN: THE GREAT LUNCHABLE WAR

Prompt: Make a new story, use Batman’s rouges! Make it more stupid and twisted

Scene 1: The Dark Knight’s Pre-Lunch Crisis

(The Batcave is eerily quiet. Batman stands in front of the Batcomputer, staring intently at a single Lunchable box. It’s the “Ham & Cheddar” variety, but something is wrong. Batman’s eyes twitch.)

Batman (whispering to himself):
There’s no crackers... Only ham. The crackers... they’re gone.

(Alfred enters, holding a massive tray of boiled eggs. He looks at Batman with mild concern.)

Alfred:
Master Wayne, I don’t understand. You’ve been here for three hours... staring at a single Lunchable. What has happened?

Batman (suddenly standing, eyes wide):
Alfred, the crackers… they’ve been stolen. By someone worse than the Joker. Someone much worse.

Alfred (nodding):
Yes, but… I still don’t understand. It’s just lunch. It's... lunch.

Batman (slamming his fist on the Batcomputer):
The Lunchables are the key, Alfred! This is bigger than Gotham! This is about snacktime supremacy! And I know exactly who’s behind it: The Penguin.

Scene 2: The Penguin’s Lair

(In a dimly lit, absurdly over-the-top lair resembling a discount ice cream truck, The Penguin, wearing an absurdly small tuxedo, stands atop a mountain of snack-sized crackers. He laughs maniacally, his flippers flapping as he tosses individual crackers into the air.)

The Penguin (laughing):
At last, Gotham will bow to my cracker kingdom! No one will dare question the Penguin’s Snack Empire now! Every Lunchable will be mine! HA-HA!

(Suddenly, a crash echoes through the lair. Batman bursts through the door in his Batmobile, which is inexplicably shaped like a giant pickle. The car transforms into a fully operational sandwich submarine.)

Batman (pointing at Penguin):
Stop this madness, Penguin! You cannot control the snacks of Gotham!

Penguin (scoffing):
I already have, Batman! Your crackers are mine!

(Batman pulls out a remote control and presses a button. From behind the Penguin, a large machine resembling a giant stapler emerges and starts randomly stapling slices of processed cheese onto the Penguin’s flippers.)

Batman (menacingly):
That’s right, Penguin. Now you will face… THE SANDWICH STAPLER OF JUSTICE.

Scene 3: Enter the Other Villains

(Just as Batman is about to face the Penguin in the ultimate snack standoff, a massive explosion erupts in the lair. Out of the smoke emerges a bizarre trio of villains.)

The Riddler (dressed as a giant burrito):
Batman! You’ve walked right into my trap! I knew you’d come for the crackers, but it’s time to solve the real riddle… the mystery of the missing pizza rolls!

Batman (confused):
What? What missing pizza rolls?

The Riddler (smirking):
That’s the riddle! Find the pizza rolls, Batman, or Gotham falls into an abyss of mediocrity! Where… where snack foods no longer have meaning!

(Suddenly, Harley Quinn bursts in, riding a giant inflatable duck. She’s holding a bat, but the bat is literally just a hot dog on a stick.)

Harley Quinn (laughing hysterically):
Oh, puddin’! This is gonna be SO much fun! I’m here to throw the mustard on this mess! WOOHOO!

(A giant inflatable hot dog also bursts from the wall, and the Joker emerges from within, holding a ketchup bottle that sprays in the shape of a giant smiling face.)

Joker (gleefully):
That’s right, Batsy! You’re too late! The Gotham Snack Revolution has already begun! And guess who’s the Snack King now? THIS GUY! SHEESH!

(The Joker holds up a tray of half-eaten nachos with a single olive on top, like it’s the Holy Grail.)

Scene 4: The Ultimate Snack Battle

(The Batcave transforms into a chaotic, apocalyptic battlefield. Penguin launches crackers like frisbees, while the Riddler’s burrito suit makes him dangerously elusive. Harley Quinn bounces around on her inflatable duck, whacking everyone with her hot dog bat.)

Batman (dodging a flying cracker):
This ends now, villains! Gotham's snack time will never fall into chaos!

(Batman pulls out a gadget that looks like a combination of a blender and a toaster. It starts firing snack-sized granola bars at high speeds, knocking the villains back.)

Batman (shouting):
I will not allow Gotham to be turned into a snack wasteland!

Joker (mockingly):
Oh, Batsy, you’ll never stop us! You can’t even figure out how to properly fold a tortilla! HAHAHA!

(Batman pauses, then pulls out a tortilla and proceeds to fold it with precise, unsettling efficiency. He hands it to Joker.)

Batman (deadpan):
There. Happy now?

Joker (pauses, confused):
Wait… WHAT? How did you—?

(Just as Joker is about to scream, the entire lair starts shaking. The giant inflatable hot dog collapses, and a massive explosion of nacho cheese erupts from the walls.)

Batman (grimly):
You’ve gone too far, Joker. The cheese is the final straw.

Scene 5: The Unexpected Twist

(In the final moments of the battle, Batman realizes something truly horrifying. As he pulls out a tray of actual crackers from his utility belt, he is confronted by the last villain… Catwoman.)

Catwoman (calmly holding a jar of peanut butter):
Batman… You’ve been so focused on crackers, you missed the real danger… the peanut butter. It’s creamy… and smooth… and it’s taking over Gotham’s snack industry.

Batman (eyes widening):
No… not the peanut butter.

Catwoman (smirking):
Oh yes. The peanut butter conspiracy is real. I’ve been working with the peanut lobbyists for years. The crackers? A distraction. The real plan? To spread peanut butter across every sandwich, every cracker, and every tortilla in Gotham. Forever.

(Batman gasps, horrified.)

Batman (breathlessly):
But… but you can’t… There’s no bread left for it.

Catwoman (holding up a loaf of bread made entirely of gold):
There is now.

Final Scene:

(The Batcave is silent. Gotham’s fate hangs in the balance. Batman stands alone in the wreckage, holding a single cracker, staring at it as if it’s the last hope of humanity.)

Batman (whispering):
I must make a choice... to stop the Peanut Butter Crisis... or to let it unfold and watch Gotham crumble under the weight of… too much creaminess.

(Suddenly, a large billboard outside the Batcave lights up: “PIZZA DAY SALE – 50% OFF EVERYTHING” and Batman drops the cracker. He walks toward the Batmobile with a new mission.)

Batman (determined):
No. There’s always one solution. Pizza.

1hqtndm,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hqtndm/what_do_i_say_to_mom/,What do I say to mom?,"My (F30) mom (50's), is recently divorced from my bio dad. Long story short, he was a neglectful pos who cheated on her and made the divorce drag out but it wrapped up in July 2024.

My mom is the type to bottle up or hide how she's feeling unless she's alone. Previous relationships have left her very...anti men, but lonely and desperate for companionship. She's very independent, stuck in her ways and wants someone to share her life with without having having to compromise or sacrifice her independence. It's semi unreasonable - I've explained this but her stance is that if a man can take her as is, she doesn't want them.

It's New Years Eve and the guy (Guy A) she has gone on a few dates with has been acting like a jerk - her words and no further explanation. I think she spooked him and he's pudding her away - he's also recently divorced, more recent than she is (like 2 months recent) and after only two dates she asked if this was going to lead to anything or if he was just trying to hangout because she's not interested in hanging out. I told her it was way too early to bring up the ""what are we"" but...clearly she didn't listen. The other guy she started talking to has a history with her and they were supposed to go out tonight.

The guy (Guy B) she was supposed to go out with tonight dated her in high school. Now...this guy...woof...he just started talking to my mom again after running into my grandmother. (I guess he went to where my gma works, saw a picture of my mom (my gma has her office thoroughly decorated with family pictures) and asked how she knew my mom and he reached out to my mom following that) Guy B went out to lunch with my mom to ""pick her brain"" about....divorce. Apparently his marriage is a disaster and he's not even staying at his house anymore. In his words, his wife is a leach who doesn't work and only spends his money and he's decided to stay with his sister until he gets the ball rolling on divorcing. On Christmas Eve, he calls my mom, drunk, spouting off about how he and his group of friends got kicked out of the bowling alley because they were trying to close. You know...because it's Christmas Eve. And why my mom went to go see him...idk. She met up, they went and got some coffee and after talking...he. kissed. my. mom. TWICE. 

My mom told him enough, that nothing was going to halogen because he's freaking married and he needs to be divorced because (she's been down this road before) she's not going to be the ""other woman"". Fast forward tonight, I guess they were supposed to meet up but he stood her up.

Now...I don't have any context for this otherwise but she called me, obviously crying but trying to be hush hush about it. I told her.i was sorry that guys are trash and that dating is hard. I told her to go to bed and invited her to come hangout tomorrow to vent or otherwise distract herself - I doubt she will. 

But I'm just at a loss for what to say to keep her from shutting down and giving up. My mom is the type of person who can't be alone for too long because she gets lonely and depressed. Being older isn't helping either due to issues that are age related (no kids at home, going through menopause, general age related health issues). She's not unattractive, in fact, in the past three years, she's lost over 200 pounds. She works a full time job, makes decent money. She's also super fun to hangout with and super funny.

But she's blind to all of this because my mother has virtually no self confidence outside of what others think of her. Not even my own words of encouragement matter to her. ""You have to say that because you're my daughter."" Like, no, I really don't. But...yeah. I'm just at a loss. I wish she would take some time learn to love herself and be okay with being alone but that's not a conversation she's willing to have, let aline be receptive to. Also, to add, she is vehemently against therapy. ",2,1735698059.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

He didn't give me any mixed signals 
He always said Yes to hangout
We had a really great sex
He said “I know this is too early but I want to say I love you because the sex feels so right”

We hung out at each others place couple of times, see each other 1-2 times per week.

He always kisses me like every 10 minutes whenever we are together in person.

He totally seemed like he was so into me.

But one day, I initiated my frustration on him over text. Saying why didn't you checking on me more and text me more? 

Then he called me and said let's talk about us.

He said he likes me a lot but thats it. He cannot see himself to say I love you to me.
He said everything is great and you are really quality women but he cannot see me in his future. 

I was confused. We talked about it for 50 minutes and agreed to move on. 

And my anxiety kicked in, I called him back right away crying, asked him to try a little bit more because 2 months is too short to know each other, and what we had was too good to just let go.

His voice changed and said “I already made up my mind”


I couldn't sleep at all.

I spent the night thinking about us and processing all that happened and his word, texted him in the morning, I get it and I will move on. Maybe we could meet one day to have a cup of coffee or something.

And he said of course we can still hangout and reach out to him whenever I need him.

I guess we said goodbye on good terms.

I immediately unfollowed him on IG and deleted all the text messages. 

But I have little intuitive feeling that he might reach out back to me in a couple of weeks or so. 

I just had feeling something is not really clearly over.

Am I being delusional? ( I think I am) 

2 months of relationship hit me really hard and I don't know if I can get over him pretty soon.

Now I’m wondering if this happens more frequently but I never noticed.

It NYE and I am a single, late 30s guy posting on r4r. I am clearly the coooooooolest and eveyone wants to hang out with me! No. I am not celebrating the New Years with frozen pizza…..

Let’s get some things out of the way. I am an atheist. I don’t want kids or to be a step dad.  I am fairly left leaning. I am not a communist or socialist, but I’ve been called it. I am a very bad texter. I often text back in between activities so I tend to be brief. I am more of a voice chatter.

So let’s get to it. I am single. I would like to unsingle. This is reddit and I don’t think this will happen here. However. Nice fun conversation is something that could happen. That’s great. 

I am tragically boring and mediocre person. I know I am suppose to sell myself on how cool I am but……….. I’m not. [Insert Giggles] You know what, I am damn proud of it. Took me a lot of work to get my 3.0 at a mid tier college so I can work my regular job at my cube farm. Not everyone, can be as cool as Elon. Joking. I am joking. I have played DnD, not joking. I often un-ironically think, “I am too old for this.” I even own one of those daily pill organizers. I swear I am 39. I checked. I am bad at math, but I am not THAT BAD at math. I hope. I am guilty of being a typical millennial male in which I have done these things in a cringe way; done stand up comedy, played in a metal band, thought I was cool for being a gamer and many more. Just ask! I don’t care much for sushi and I dislike IPAs. Look, I don’t hate sushi, I’ll go and I’ll be happy. I never crave it and would choose to just go get a sandwich. I do like my lightly roasted coffees though. Oh goddammit. I am DRINKING a light roast brew as I write this. I am a ham burger enthusiast. I have never seen Breaking Bad or the Wire.

Currently my life is busy. I work and I am a bit of a workaholic at the moment because I am trying to make changes, and advances to my current career. Maybe even a career change. I am also trying to change my living situation. So a lot of my energy is directed at be productive. I am not a die -hard workaholic in which this is my complete lifestyle. I am just trying to make changes. However. I do like to “work” at things. I get deep into hobbies and subjects. I am investing heavily into my health by working out regularly and eating better. I am really looking to increasing my physical activity. I feel as I age, fitness is more critical.  All I want for my future, at this moment, is to work at a job I enjoy, and to be healthy. Yes. My schedule is stacked. I do want to and like to, take time from being productive to spend time with friends and to do fun things. 

What are fun things I like doing? As I hope to draw this workaholic phase to a close soon I would like to start a Punk Rock band, establish a marijuana farm and spend more time at the climbing gym. I am totally lying. I am not that cool. I used to spend a lot of time at galleries and museums when I was in college and I really miss doing so. I feel very fortunate to live on the west coast and I should go out and experience more for this region. I would really like to get more politically involved. I participate in election canvassing this past election and I feel like need to do so again and participate in a greater degree. I want to get into the performing arts. I want be in a play at least once. I am embarrassingly under-read and I want to read more. 

Lets hit the controversial malarkey. Atheist. Very atheist. I never lost the faith, because I never had it to begin with. I am  not spiritual either. I don’t even know what it means to be spiritual. Politically, I really care about the environment, infrastructure, limiting the power and influence of the rich, and education. I don’t think Elon is or was cool. Not wanting to be a parent is pretty self explanatory?  You don’t have to aligned with me on these ideas. I am pretty open and accepting. I just want to put it out there for those who find this important. 

What am I looking for here? Conversation would be a nice start, especially over voice chats. See my bad texter comment. If you ever hang out with me I promise to bake you cookies.",5,1735697901.0,cf4cf,1,0.78,False

1hqtkjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hqtkjs/i_tried_caffeine/,I tried caffeine...,"For the first time ever, (Disclaimer I am highly suspecting not diagnosed) I have an appt this month. Now I know caffeine isnt great if not moderated or careful with but it worked out! Ive always been curious what caffeine could do to me. I have never liked anything that has caffeine in it and never knew there was an option of drink mix powders with caffeine. I hate soda (carbonation), tea and coffee.  Also everyone has always been like you should not do it we cant imagine the amount of energy youd bounce off the walls wed be scared for you. 

So, when I found out there were drink mixes I spent the past year going back and forth of forgetting and debating. I finally made a choice to test it out. 

It was 75 mg so not much I think compared to the daily healthy limit. I drank it around 12:50 and by 1:20 I felt sleepy for like a minute and then it was like a switch flipped when I thought about what I needed/wanted to do. On top of that my brain like dampened/calmed the hell down. Like it wasn't silenced but like it was like my head stopped bouncing and throwing balls of thoughts all over the room. I started laundry I budgeted, I made a sandwhich and during that process I heard the dryer go off. My boyfriend then told me it was off and ready and I heard him! Like it wasnt he talked and it didnt click, it was I heard him say it and responded yea I heard it and (even bigger thing) said I needed to finish making sandwhich.

Then when I finished I put all the stuff away, I wasnt bouncing around like crazy (inside and out) I just put it away. Then I even remembered and headed downstairs to check the dryer! I then restarted it as clothes weren't dry and went upstairs and grabbed my food and ate. I also was doing something I forgot what though (caffeine has to have worn off cause Im back to my normal self) But even while doing stuff I still could hear and process what my boyfriend told me each time the first time. I dont know how to like just describe the absolute peace? like of mind and flow of just being. 

I even like after I finished and my clothes were ready I got dressed. Then I put my siblings seat in my car. I got all my stuff ready to go and I didn't forget any of them and left on time to get my sibling. Anyways hours later I know it has to be gone. But now I think I have gotten a taste of actually feeling functional. It was just something Ive never felt the closest like sorta similar I've gotten is when I tunnel vision focus (maybe its hyperfocus or something) and I feel good on the one thing but instead of that it was just being productive.

Maybe its not adhd, Im told a lot that I probably have it.  normally I always ended up friends or getting along better with autistic, audhd and adhd folks (are diagnosed) who have at one point all asked and called it that Ive got adhd. But Im not willing to accept any of my suspicions fully until psychiatrist visit confirms its that, something else or nothing at all and Im just broken in the head.

I just wanted to get this all out because as much as it's not big on the outside it was huge for me inside. My boyfriend cant really understand. Even talking to him he's like yea thats just how normal people are. And I responded yea for you and everyone else maybe but for me it was practically like a new experience a whole different (originally thought new and thought of aladdin a whole new worlllddd) world. Also in case Im sorry if I do not belong here I just always lurk and a lot of post feel so relatable to majority of my life 

I also dont want to use caffeine too much. I pray I dont become very tolerant and I plan to save using any for important days/deadlines or when Im gonna have a rough day so around my period probably😅. I am also now leaning towards if I do get diagnosed to get meds straightaway. My main fear is just first off am I even going to be diagnosed it could be nothing at all or maybe something else and then if I was welll, the side effects.

TLDR :  I tried caffeine for the first time and it went really well. Im really shocked and excited about how much I did and could function in so little time and not struggle. Cant wait for a doctor to help me.",1,1735697773.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
