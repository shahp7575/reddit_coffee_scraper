I met him on Bumble. I was single, divorced for over 6yrs. I believed he was single as well. From the beginning, there was an immediate connection. He was emotionally guarded, but I was deeply interested and patient. Over time, he opened up. We spent the spring and summer together, seeing each other often, between my home and his apartment. This was the first man since my divorce that I did not want to keep casual.


He works very close to where I work. He would finish earlier and stop by, bringing me a coffee, a snack, sometimes lunch or dessert. He would kiss me hello, stay for a few minutes while I finished my day, then leave. That routine became part of our everyday life

He would cook dinner for me, and I would go to his place after work 3 times a week and we'd spend the weekend together.

At the end of the summer, he told me that his ex wife had contacted him and wanted to talk. After that conversation, they decided to try to rebuild their family for their children. She and the kids were going to move to our city, and he had to buy a house for them. We chose a date. The end would be when she moved into that house. Until then, during the house search, the trips to see her, and the preparations for the move, we stayed together. That period was our goodbye. By then, we had already said I love you to each other. 
It was painful, but I accepted it. I did not ask many questions. Still, the first night knowing he was sleeping next to her while I was alone in my bed was one of the hardest moments I have lived through.
When the move happened, we stopped seeing each other physically. We did not block each other. We stayed connected through texts, calls, and social media. Our safe space. 



Later, he asked to see me because he needed to tell me something important. He told me that his wife was pregnant and cried in my arms and said it had been too heavy to keep from me. 
The night the baby was born, I did not sleep. They were at the hospital with family and in laws, communication was difficult, and I stayed awake the entire night, alone, waiting, feeling invisible.


When he went back into family life, I needed something for myself. I needed the feeling, or at least the illusion, that I was still free. That is when I told him I was going back to dating and that I would not delete Bumble. He struggled with that at first. We had difficult conversations. Not because I wanted to leave him, but because I needed my mind and my heart to survive this reality. Eventually, he accepted it.


I was recently away for 3 weeks. At the same time, he was on a 2 weeks work trip, we talked and facetimed every day. He came back 2 days before me and when I returned, he insisted on picking me up from the airport, which is 2.5hrs from my place. We talked the entire drive. Because I had people waiting at my place, we spent some time together at a hotel before he went home. He told me how hard Christmas will be for him, they have a 3 weeks vacation, they are traveling and he'll be less available with the children, family presence, and a newborn... 



Now the connection is hard, I understand the reasons, but the waiting still hurts. I am spending Christmas alone, feeling lonely.
I think I am going back on Bumble to try dating again, just for this period. It says casual on my profile. I am not sure I will be able to truly enjoy the dates, but I will try to show up and be good company. I need something that reminds me I am still free, even if only a little.



I love him deeply. And I am grateful to have found a space like this, where I can say these things honestly and not feel so alone in it.",1,1766902543.0,theotherwoman,1,1.0,False

Here’s a gallbladder attack 🎄,"Background: I’ve been on a GLP-1 since June and have lost 70 lbs to this point. I understand that losing weight too quickly can increase the risk of developing gallbladder issues.

After a cup of black coffee and 2 bites into a sausage and egg casserole on Christmas morning, I started experiencing what i could only describe as really bad heartburn. Over the next hour, the pain progressed to a 10/10 and I was writhing on the floor moaning, gasping, and unable to speak. My dad took me to the hospital and, after a couple boli of dilaudid and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with gallstones. I was sent home with instructions to follow a very low fat diet and contact a surgeon to discuss having my gallbladder removed.

Y’all, I’ve never been in pain like that before. It was so much worse than being in labor. I’m terrified of another attack so I’ve been eating gummy worms, egg whites, fig newtons, fruit, and low fat bread since yesterday morning. Now that I know where I was feeling gallbladder pain, I recall times in recent months when I had a gnawing ache in that same spot but nothing like the “knife straight through me” pain I had the other morning.

My uncle cautioned against jumping straight to cholecystectomy, and he said he regrets having his gallbladder removed. I intend to connect with my gastroenterologist in the new year to discuss with him. I’d like to hear about your experiences, though- how many attacks did you endure before biting the bullet and having your gallbladder removed? How has your life changed? If you didn’t go that route, why not? What adjustments have you made to your lifestyle to reduce the risk of future attacks?

# Beyond the Bean: The Magic of a Home Coffee Roaster

Ever wondered what makes your favorite coffee taste so distinct? The answer often lies in the roasting process. While cafes and large companies have commercial roasters, a growing number of coffee enthusiasts are bringing this craft into their own kitchens with home coffee roasters. This isn't just about freshness; it's about unlocking a universe of flavor.

A home coffee roaster offers unparalleled control. You can experiment with different roast levels – from a light, vibrant ""cinnamon"" roast that highlights origin characteristics to a deep, rich ""French"" roast that emphasizes smoky notes. This granular control allows you to tailor each batch to your palate, transforming green coffee beans into your perfect cup. Imagine waking up to coffee roasted just yesterday, precisely to your liking.

*   **Freshness Revolution:** Roasted beans lose volatile aromatics rapidly. Roasting at home means your coffee is at its peak flavor potential when you brew it.
*   **Flavor Exploration:** Discover unique flavor profiles by experimenting with roast times, temperatures, and bean origins, going far beyond supermarket offerings.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial investment exists, buying green coffee beans in bulk and roasting them yourself can significantly reduce your per-cup cost over time.

Ready to elevate your coffee game? Explore the world of home coffee roasting and discover your signature flavor.

1pxjwcg,https://i.redd.it/3rcbfzyoxv9g1.png,Looking at my wardrobe at year end,"Have been into Fragrances for now almost a year and was able to add few bangers in my wardrobe 

Designers 
1) Dior Sauvage EDP ; No brainer - the best ever masculine ambroxan-touch scent ever created. The top note of Bergamot and Pepper is just wow 🤌. I've had it's best use in meetings and client presentation, gives a subtle clean confidence. I would keep reaching for Sauvage no matter how much hate it gets! 

2) Davidoff Cool Water EDT ; Again a no brainer, out of shower and a few puffs of it induces a next level fresh mood. It's not a scent or perfume, it's just for mood setter for next 30-40 min. 

3) Spicebomb Extreme EDP ; Tbh I love the scent profile and notes, the opening of black pepper is a wake-up spicy call and even the drydown is soo sexy of Vanilla but it doesn't perform well on me. I don't know maybe a wrong batch or what but this doesn't last beyond 3/4 hours even in winters. 

4) JPG Le Beau Paradise Garden ; Almost majority of peeps would not like this as they would be reminiscent of Parachute oil. I love that smell of parachute and I was at shoppers stop and was reviewing which JPG to buy, just the first puff of this and I knew this is my kinda scent. The coconut and the minty notes at the opening 🤌🤌. Just like stepping into a tropical garden. 

5) D&G Light Blue Capri In Love ; Again a different choice. I was at shoppers stop and after all choices I rundown to YSL Y and Capri in Love. 90% would have easily gone with Y edp but I kinda liked capri in love above Y edp 🙃. A minimal perfume with just three notes of Fig, Patchouli and pepper it's I guess the best freshie I've smelt for summers. It's that simplicity done right , the top - mid - base shift is so simple and harmonious. Again not a popular choice for many , but this clicked me! 

Entry Niche ;
Montale Intense Café ; The first spray hits you with a burst of milk coffee and rose petals… then turns into something warm, creamy, and almost edible. Almost feels like drinking cappuccino while someone besides is cutting fresh rose petals. Best for winter nights and projects crazy for intial hours and then turns intimiate. Not a scent for compliments or so but again a cozy Romatic introspective mood setter. 

Middle Eastern 
1) Afnan Rare Reef ; OMG the best creation I've held is this afnan Flanker - someone peeling orange besides and later on turns into a floral garden with lots of freshness! Like Sauvage I would keep reaching for this bottle after bottle! 

2) Lattafa Khamra Dukhan ; Not many would like it , someone would be even reminded of ayurvedic oil. But this is a 10/10 for me - the sweetness of qahwa is gone and is turned to something smoky and spicy with a sweeter drydown. Gives the vibe of a middle eastern Sheesha lounge. Crazy Projection!

3) Ahmed Al Maghribi Kaaf Noir ; I can now confirm this is a dupe of K EDP by D&G. Smells 90% the same. With orange and juniper berries in top notes and vetiver in base , this is a scent for winter nights! Crazy Projection and lasting. 

4) Lattafa Asad ; Why did I even bought this 🥲. The opening is too harsh and peppery and no where near to Sauvage Elixir, the mid and drydown is nice but the opening kills the mood. Yeah but this def smells expensive and lasts crazy! 

5) French Avenue Royal Blend ; Never smelt kilian angle share so don't know how accurate it is but it's a party scent! The boozy and cinnamon notes makes it a club vibe mood. I didn't got much projection from this, kinda intimiate and lasts around 6/7 hours. Royal Blend is a well crafted boozy gourmand that gives you dessert + luxury + warmth in one bottle I guess! 

6) Rassasi Fattan EDP ; My Daily office wear. With Fattan you eithet hate it till your death or love it till you last! It's a 0 or 1 scent. For me it's a 1! The green freshness after few initial minutes is too good and makes the start of day a very fresh and clean setting! This was my 4th bottle of Fattan and surely won't be the last one! But this is the least safe blind buy among all - as I said, eithet 0 or 1.

Various Miscellaneous 
1) Zara  Bogoss Vibrant leather ; Delicious pineapple 🍍 which I guess none of the scent can match but doesn't fucking last beyond 15-20 min 😓.

2) Ferrari Scuderia Black EDT ; A simple apple based fresh EDT , can be applied after shower just like davidoff. 

3) Mancera Coco Vanille decant ; A very luxury lotion of tropical coconut and vanilla! A room filler and crazy projection anr lasting. A headache for gourmand haters. I would consider it's full bottle maybe in my next buy! 8/10 for me! 

4) Mancera Aoud Café décant ; 2/10 for me. Too bitter and kinda kills my mood. Have not even used decant since months now. 

5) Haimidi Perfume Oils ; Just for layering and on clothes for overall good smell through the day. 

6) House of EM5 ; Imagination, Elysium, Opium, fireplace and Flora Roll on! Again a blind buy, kinda good scent but doesn't perform well and lasts just 2/3 hours. Would never like to pay 800 INR for this bad performance 

I would pause for sometime now and would not consider buying anything for coming months. Time to enjoy my collection 🥂",14,1766901632.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,3,1.0,False

Poverty (she’s on welfare but doesn’t get enough to live and since she got a part time job they subtracted that $ from her payments, no help for car repairs etc so I send money home sometimes) 

Rough rural living (no running water or indoor plumbing, house heated only by woodstove which takes lots of physical work, then she needs to get water from the well outside, carry it inside the house, heat it up in pots slowly on the woodstove). -30 celsius winters with lots of snow.

Animal rescuer (donkeys, ducks, cats & dog take $$$$ and work, going out in the middle of the night with buckets of hot water and a shovel to smash the ice on the animals water dishes, shovelling out enclosures). 

Lifelong insomnia (1-3 hours of sleep for the last 10 years). Constant exhaustion, lives on coffee all day, wine in evening. Can’t manage to feed herself until late at night which is bad when you’re working outside in the cold. 

Likely on the autism spectrum, aware she has ADHD, depression, EXTREME social anxiety, agoraphobia. Hoarding, VERY messy house, won’t let anyone in her house, freaks out if someone comes by. Won’t let anyone come help her. 

Arthritis, an eye condition that needs surgery, horrible chronic eczema on both hands. 

Lives in rural Ontario in a tiny town where she doesn’t feel belonging with people and is isolated. But she can’t move because of her animals, and because she has a cheap (although physically hard) living situation. 

…

I moved out at 19 because as a teenager I dropped out and was making all the meals, cleaning the house, helping with the animals, I had to get out and see what was out there.

I have a beautiful life on the west coast and I want to plant more roots. I have a partner and I reaaally want kids, but I’m worried that in some years I’m going to have to move back and be her caregiver. I do NOT want to move back, I don’t like cold winters, isolation, or living without running water. I can’t convince my mom to move to the west coast. 

She said tonight that if her health ever declines rapidly, she would choose medical assisted death.

But the thing is, she’s an EXTREMELY beautiful person, more intellectually intelligent than most people I’ve met, very caring and compassionate to all people and beings, a VERY talented artist that could have gone far if she chose this path. I’ve tried hundreds of times to help her wake up to this, but she still lives in limiting beliefs, soooooo hard on herself, no boundaries, doesn’t self advocate or ask for what she needs. 


What should I do??

Be a ‘good’ daughter and move home to help her? 

Live my life in freedom and carve my own path and let her live her life as is? Until the day she can’t? 

I’ve tried to help her better her health now so she can live healthier longer, but people need to choose change themselves and it’s really hard to change patterns.

THT has been a huge part of my life I listen when I get ready, when I study, when I’m driving. I just love it so much… but now I need advice. 

Me (F20) and my boyfriend J (M20) have been dating for about 9 months now and he is truly the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. 

A total Cinderella story, we are from the same town, he liked me for about 4 years before I actually met him at a country concert, we go on all sorts of adventures, we rarely disagree and even when we do we always talk it out. His family is amazing I love his parents and they love me too, absolutely spoil me as thought I’m their daughter. My family adores J.  J and I have an amazing friend group. He’s going to school to be a fireman, and I’m in university taking Biology. 

So, I really see a beautiful future laid ahead of me here with this boy even though we have been together less than a year. 

J and I have been intimate with each other since before we were even dating and it has always been great. But in the past 3 months I could tell something was wrong, almost like a lack of passion for it. 

J comes from a Christian family, like church every Sunday. Which I’ve really embraced, I myself went to Catholic school growing up but was not a consistent churchgoer. I’ve been going every Sunday with J for almost our entire relationship thus far, and I’ve been super supportive even though my beliefs are a little more loose. His family is strict on facts from the bible so they have some beliefs such as the earth being flat or that it’s sitting on 4 quartz pillars. I study biology, so I just give my head a shake and choose to love them quirks and all. 

Recently J had been going on some coffee dates with other people from church to talk about their faith journeys. Both of them being men, one is our pastor he’s I’d guess in his 40’s and the other being a young married man 22, who actually got married at 20. I thought the coffee dates were cute and it’s nice that he’s becoming part of a network, now I’m not so sure. 

About a week ago now after being intimate 2 days in a row J sat me down and said he doesn’t want to have s\*x until we are married. I was really puzzled as neither of us were virgins when we met, and we have been sleeping together for almost a year, like I feel that ship has kind of sailed. But no, he said on his coffee dates with members from the church the biggest piece of advice he was given was to not have s\*x until marriage. He assured me he still loves me and actually wants to do this because he is so serious about our relationship and sees a future with me. 

Unfortunately he also said that when he had recently been sleeping with me he felt guilt, or even regret. He claims that in the times that we do not sleep together, he feels like God is rewarding him by giving him easier days, or even healing his shoulder that he had surgery on earlier this year. He even said that if I wasn’t okay with this new concept that he felt peace in us possibly breaking up. 

Anyways this past Friday we had a party at my house got pretty drunk and had s\*x, oh yeah and not anything vanilla either I’m talking like a whopping wild 3 rounds. I woke up Saturday morning happy as ever because I thought maybe he had changed his mind. 

But then we talked about what happened and he told me he regretted it, and still wants to stick to no s\*x until marriage. I told him, I’m in school, we are so young, I don’t want this to accelerate the process of us getting married. 

As much as I love and respect J, I have had some past experiences where s\*x was a chore or guilted, it’s supposed to be fun, it might be a love language of mine as I feel really connected when we do it. It IS really important to me, and I am not handling making it some sort of taboo well at all. 

It’s reopening some of my body dysmorphia issues, as my brain is confused and is making me feel anxious or not pretty because I’m associating him not wanting to have s\*x with me as him not being attracted to me. I’ve told him this but he’s been cold and is really sure that we can “do this together because we are so strong”. 

Love the enthusiasm but unfortunately for me… it’s making me resent church, I feel judged, I am off put that this advice was given in the first place because it’s so intimate and nobody’s business. The hypocrisy is beyond too, as his parents literally had J before they graduated high school.  Do the math. 

I am stumped and any advice would be greatly appreciated. I love J so much but I feel like this is going to ruin my self esteem and body image, and possibly even our passion. Thank you!!",8,1766901481.0,TwoHotTakes,19,0.9,False

Realistically, how many people can you truly “get to know” through endless chats alone? If there’s no intention to eventually meet in person, even for something simple like coffee or a movie, what’s the purpose of being on a dating sub?

Dating is meant to create real connections, not just fill time or provide temporary distraction. Sometimes it feels like people are here only to kill boredom, seek validation, or pass the day by talking to someone new, without any direction or follow-through.
Is this because social media and overexposure have changed how we approach connection? Or are we overthinking things to the point where basic effort feels like too much?

DAE with anxiety on average never have any issue falling asleep or staying asleep? 

I've been speaking to a psychologist for over a year and seeing a psychiatrist for a few months about anxiety. I never have sleep issues though or particularly thoughts about anything that sounds like anxiety. I get into freeze modes where there is lack of thoughts, I physically feel what would be anxiety. Being so physically overwhelmed and mentally that i can't leave my home for things (I had this during a particularly stressful period of time when I was young and would be punished for being late to things so i think it relates to that but im not sure)

I'm trying to understand anxiety without sleep issues (like staying up ruminating or having thoughts) or anxious thoughts in general. I have nightmares nightly which distrub me for a good chunk of the day upon waking when I get into stressful periods, but I always can sleep. 

Does that make sense for anxiety? Sometimes I feel like it's not anxiety but my body reacting to stimuli that trigger stress. Coffee doesn't make me anxious, any weird heart flutters that dont actually mean anything doesn't make me anxious . But physically I get stuck sometimes and overwhelmed by triggers or certain people or things that is linked to past experiences. It's less mental though. I logic everything out constantly since I first started going through a stressful period of my life. Is *stress* triggered by things and freezing *not* anxiety?

Over a year of speaking to a professional and I don't think the guy understands me. Granted, I have a difficult time expressing this. I'm not sure that it's *anxiety* if there is no mental thoughts or *worry* right?",1,1766900608.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1pxjird,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1pxjird/silva_mind_control_method_challenge_days_11_to_15/,SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD CHALLENGE DAYS 11 to 15,"**Only those who successfully practiced day 6 to 10 can proceed with days 11 to 15**

  
  
**What to Do in the Morning Days 11–15**

During the third sequence of five days, your morning “work” becomes still easier. Now you count backward from 25 to 1. You will get just as deeply relaxed with this shorter countdown as you did counting backward the first five days from 100 to 1 and the second five days from 50 to 1, and probably even more so.

Your body and mind are learning to relax. You need less and less time to count down. Since the countdown is the triggering factor, you will always need a countdown, but on Mornings 16 to 20, you will use 5 to 1. You will continue to use 5 to 1 after that. It will become your standard method of entering alpha.

Your morning action plan for the third five morning (Days 11–15) is the same as for the second five mornings (Days 6–10), except for the reduced count.

**To summarize:**

1. Recline on your bed.
2. Close your eyes, turn them slightly upward, and count backward slowly from 25 to 1.
3. Repeat: “Each time I relax this way, I go deeper, faster.”
4. “Positive thoughts bring me all the benefits and advantages I desire.”
5. “One two, three…when I open eyes at the count of five, I’ll be wide awake, feeling great!”
6. “Four, five.” Eyes open. “I am wide awake, feeling, great!”

You will be going deeper during these five days and doing so in less time. It therefore becomes all the more important for you to emphasize the mental assertion that you make twice when coming out, at the count of 3 and again when you open your eyes at the count of 5: “Wide awake, feeling great!”

Note that we now use an exclamation point after this statement. That is because you need to put more “punch” into it, more emphasis. Because you are deeper into alpha, it takes this extra emphasis on being wide awake to bring you all the way back to beta.

If you don’t make it all the way back, there is no danger—that is, no more danger than when you get up in the morning not quite fully awake. Lots of yawning! “Another cup of coffee, please.”



**What to Do at Noon Days 11–15**

Somewhere in your bedroom are little pieces of paper or pad where your dreams of the past five nights are recorded (Evenings 6 though 10). They are going to make interesting reading for you during the next five lunch hours, as part of your “doing.”

Whenever we go to the alpha level, we are more creative. This is demonstrated by one of our Silva lecturers in his classroom activity. He has students write whatever sentence or phrase comes to mind. Then he has them go to alpha, open their eyes, and again write anything that pops into their heads.

The class then listens to each student read his or her two sentences without identifying which was written at alpha. The class almost always correctly identifies the alpha writing. What is written at alpha is usually more philosophical. It contains more wisdom and creativity. It is usually deeper in its meaning than what is written at beta.

You will now use this added wisdom and creativity at alpha to help you become a better dream interpreter. You will read over your dreams at beta, select a few that attract your attention, and then read those again at alpha.

You will be practicing right-brain usage and at the same time possibly gaining some valuable insight about yourself. Here is the procedure for the next five days at lunch:

**Day 11 -** Collect all that you wrote about your dreams in the past five days and make sure you have it all with you for your after-lunch sessions. For this first noon session, go to your level with a 25 to 1 countdown, eyes turned upward slightly; when you reach the count of 1, tell yourself mentally, “I am going to open my eyes and read about my dreams. I will have perfect concentration and enhanced awareness as I seek to detect some main element or theme that might be contained in more than one dream.” You do not have to count up to end the session, as you will drift out of alpha while studying your notes. Write down the theme you identify.

**Day 12 -**  Go to your alpha level with the 25 to 1 countdown. Open your eyes and pick out the dreams that come closest to having the theme you identified yesterday. If you feel you are still too relaxed when this is done, count up.

**Day 13 -** Pick out a dream that you identified yesterday as having the common theme. Reread it. Go to your alpha level with the 25 to 1 countdown. Go over the main features of the dream as if it were a movie you are playing back. When it is over, keep it going. What might happen next? End your session with the 1 to 5 count and write down your additions to the dream and any new insights they bring.

**Day 14 -** Read the insights you recorded the day before. Go to your alpha level with the 25 to 1 countdown. Muse about these insights regarding your behavior, attitudes, or emotions. What changes or corrections are valid and possible for you to make? End your session with the 1 to 5 count, and immediately list the changes you contemplated at alpha.

**Day 15 -** Read the changes you listed yesterday. Select one. Go to alpha counting 25 to 1. See yourself with the unwanted trait you’ve identified. Now do something to make it disappear. Wash it away. Blow it away. Erase it. Now see yourself better than ever. End your session.

A word is in order about recurring dreams or recurring themes in different dreams. An example of the latter might be a sequence of dreams beginning with one in which you are on a train but there is a problem. The train is not moving. A few nights later, you might dream that you are going to horseback riding, but the horse either will not go or does not obey your tugs on the reins. Another dream with the same theme could be that you are in hurry, but your legs refuse to move fast.

These would all be dreams that indicate some matter that is causing you stress. In this case, it is probably something having to do with your progress.

Your five noon exercises, Days 11 to 15, have been valuable introductions to yourself via your dreams.

# Action Plan - Evenings 11–15

**Evening 11 -** Start in a chair, not in bed. Assume a comfortable sitting position. Go to alpha, counting 25 to 1. Imagine that you are inside your right leg. There is a large muscle there. Say hello to your muscle lovingly like it is the dear friend that it is. Then say authoritatively, “Release all tensions, ligament pressures, and unneeded negative memories, and function in a normal, healthy manner.” Next, “visit” your left leg. Now, the muscles in both arms. Greet them lovingly and give them the same instructions. Now visit your back muscles and abdominal muscles. Next, visit the neck muscles. After instructing them, add “I call on all the rest of the muscles, ligaments, and tissues in my body to release all tensions, ligament pressures, and unneeded negative memories and function in a normal, healthy manner.” End your session by counting up from 1 to 5.

**Evening 12 -** Do the same as last night, but this time visit your heart, lungs, and liver, giving them each the same instructions. Then visit your intestines, kidneys and reproductive area, giving them each the same instructions. Finally add, “I call on all the rest of the organs, glands, and systems in the body to release all tensions, ligament pressures, and unneeded negative memories and function in a normal, healthy manner.” End your session.

By the end of Evening 12, you will have freed your body of much of the resistance to relaxation that has been invested in it. Now, when you count down, you will indeed go deeper, faster.

Now let’s move on to the set of obstacles to right-brain functioning that is stored in your mind.

**Removing Mental Obstacles**

The left brain loves conflict, dichotomy, polarity. The right goes behind these differences and sees the oneness.

John W. hated his brother. It was an ongoing feud that was in its 40th year. Their two families lived in the same town, so the bad feelings were kindled frequently.

John took the Silva training, but found it difficult to relax and even more difficult to create solutions through relaxed mental picturing. He decided to recycle through the training, which is a free privilege granted to all Silva graduates. During lunch, he told the lecturer that he was not satisfied with his results and that was why he was recycling.

“I program for a perfect day, but it never comes,” John complained.

“Anything bothering you?” asked the lecturer.

“Not a thing in the world.” John replied.

“Money problems?”

“No, business is great.”

“Health?”

“Never felt better in my life.”

“Love life?”

“Couldn’t be better.”

“Peace of mind?”

“What exactly is peace of mind?” John asked.

“It’s when you are at peace with everybody and everything in your life,” offered the lecturer.

“Sure, I have peace of mind,” John replied, then added as an afterthought, “With one exception.”

“It takes only one stone to ripple the waters,” remarked the lecturer. “What’s the exception?”

John started lambasting his brother. The lecturer quickly interrupted, explaining how any negative attitude toward another person anchors the brain to the left hemisphere by its divisiveness.

“The right brain functions on level where we are all together—in the superconscious or collective unconscious. Any persistent feeling of separation prevents the necessary feeling of togetherness,” the lecturer said.

“So, what do I do?” John asked in a suspicious tone.

“Forgive him”

“Never!” John stiffened visibly. “Not that bum.”

The lecturer patiently explained that John’s brother was only behaving as he was programmed to behave. It did not matter what this programming was; the brother was behaving in a way he thought was right. John’s unwillingness to let bygones be bygones was not hurting the brother; it was hurting John and could eventually erode John’s health and shorten his life.

“So what do you want me to do?” John asked again.

“It’s not what I want. Here’s what you want yourself to do.”

The lecturer then explained the procedure: John would go to his alpha level, visualize his favorite place of relaxation, invite his brother to join him there, imagine his brother arriving, and then forgive his brother through subjective communication and ask to be forgiven by his brother.

“Feel the forgiveness being given and received,” urged the lecturer. “Mentally embrace your brother. End your session. Feel the difference and see how it releases help from the other side.”

John did it on the spot, right after lunch.

A few days later he phoned the lecturer. “I programmed for a perfect day and just had exactly that,” he reported.

A month later, for the first time in years, his brother phoned John. He invited John and his family to his daughter’s wedding. It turned out to be an objective repetition of the subjective action.



What we create in the subjective realm with our imagination manifests itself in the physical realm as reality.



**Mental Housecleaning**

Any negative emotion retained for any length of time can block help from the other side by interfering with effective right-brain functioning. Some of these negative emotions are:

Jealousy Hatred  
 Animosity Frustration  
 Disgust Blame  
 Resentment Rejection  
 Suspicion Bitterness  
 Revenge Rivalry  
 Anger Indignation  
 Fear

Actually, all of these feelings need to be replaced by one single emotion: Love. However, to go from the negative of hate to the positive of love, you must go through forgiveness.

In the next three evenings, you will subjectively forgive everybody important from your past and in your present. It will change your life.

**Here are your action plans for Evenings 13 through 15:**

Evening 13 - Seated in a comfortable chair, close your eyes, turning them slightly upward, and count backward from 25 to 1. When you reach the count of 1, mentally go to your favorite place of relaxation. One by one, you will invite the people listed below to join you; you will forgive them and ask to be forgiven by them. Feel it happening. See it happening with a handshake or hug. Do this with each, whether deceased or alive:

Paternal Grandfather  
 Maternal Grandfather  
 Paternal Grandmother  
 Maternal Grandmother  
 Father  
 Mother  
 Spouse or partner  
 Sisters  
 Brothers  
 Children

End your session counting up from 1 to 5 in the usual way.

Evening 14 - This evening you will forgive all auxiliary members of the family, but you will save time by choosing one male cousin, for instance, to “stand in” for all your male cousins, one uncle for all of your uncles, and so on. You will do the same for several categories outside of your family:

One uncle  
 One in-law, older generation  
 One aunt  
 One in-law, same generation  
 One nephew  
 One in-law, younger generation  
 One niece  
 One male cousin  
 One female cousin  
 One friend  
 One neighbor  
 One business colleague  
 One teacher

Evening 15 - We have left an important person in your life for last—yourself. You must love yourself before you can love others. Invite yourself into your favorite place of relaxation as if you were some other person. Forgive yourself for all shortcomings you think you have, all mistakes you think you’ve made, all unpleasant events you think you’ve caused. Hug yourself. End the session by counting up.

Date and time  dec 26 3:34am

On this early morning after Christmas 
I (Complainant/victim)
Had been laying down to go to bed at my father‘s house  “ technically grandmother’s”
After Christmas day
Resting

(Backing up in the timeline)

My stepmother had invited her friends to come over and drink a little bit and play 31 (card game)
While playing my father went through have a bottle of Polish vodka and a Sapporo (Japanese beer)

And my stepmother had went through an entire bottle of vodka

After this event, I stepmother decided to drive home, her friends 
(mother and daughter)
To their home

Keep in mind, my stepmother had been incredibly intoxicated and it definitely over the legal limit to drive. Even after all that she took my two-year-old sister with them.

It was also a winter storm outside blowing
79km/h = 49.1m/h and that is including heavy snow 
At least 18-27cm thick
=
At least 7.1-10.6in thick
Which mind you isn’t easy to track through and could be a hazard with driving through unploughed roads

My father came upstairs upset, looking out the window, visibly intoxicated, swearing under his breath about Star driving in the conditions and driving  intoxicated

When my stepmother came home with my sister (2 year old)
They all went downstairs and started yelling back-and-forth. My father was saying how incredibly stupid it was and my mother saying it was just a small drive.

Well, all this is happening
My little sister was screaming and crying in front of the fight, I can hear it in the background.

I had called my mom because I was also visibly and mentally shook
(I’m 15 and had not been intoxicated, unlike others)

And I was crying that I wanted a way out of the remote community
(on the way in or out is by boat or seaplane )

Somehow, my father had caught wind that I was talking to someone and my father was texting me the go downstairs immediately

I told him NO

He said if I don’t go downstairs immediately, it would be worse if he came up

I told him if he comes up and lays a finger on me I would be contacting the POLICE 

He told me there was no police in town
(my father lives in a remote community where police aren’t always around)

I told him I didn’t care and that I would still be contacting 911

He came up and started yelling at me, which I yelled back, 

which prompted him to go around the coffee table near where I was sitting and then push me and grab my arms to lock me down, and that I had to punch him to get out of the hold he had me in.

I had quickly pushed at the coffee table out of the way and beginning, run downstairs and out the front door without shoes on
(this was all in front of my stepmother and sister)

He came out yell at me saying that I was lying to the police and that I should go back inside that I was in a lot of trouble

During this time, the police redirected the call to the local authorities that came in every couple weeks to patrol

And they said to calm down and distance myself from my step parent and father

After this, I was on the phone with my mother and was recording the phone call just in case anything happens to me

My stepmother yelling at me about the past issues and that I always lie to everyone
I yelled back to step away from me and do not touch me and to move away

She began yelling, even louder to me
After that, she grabbed my collar of my shirt and again tugging at me to go back inside
(which was almost choking me out)
I had to slam the corner of my phone 
Into her right upper forehead to let me go
After that, she said I would be going to jail 
for a long time for hitting her 

I went inside to grab my shoes because I have nothing on my feet
My stepmother was standing next to the door, holding the door handle and telling me to come in and grab my shoes!

Which I denied
Seeing how she was right next to the door and could trap me in

I told her to move up the stairs, cause I didn’t feel safe around here which she did not do and would stand there next to the door, holding it and telling me to come in and grab my shoes
After multiple attempts to tell her to move upstairs, she moved up a singular stair


And I had to repeatedly ask for her to move up the stairs and to the upper landing (which took multiple attempts to ask)

Which I grabbed my shoes and went downstairs out to the driveway
They close the door and had minimal contact with me after that
I was standing in the driveway with nothing but a dress T-shirt
And some dress shorts
And some brown loafers

I was standing there talking to the local police over the phone as I had them all the time with my mother and 911

They advised me go to the local health centre
Because I told them I didn’t know anyone else in the area that wasn’t already friends with my dad

I was forgetting to walk down the driveway when a drunk man came out of nowhere yelling
About the fight outside that just happened
Saying that he could hear it down the block

He was holding a knife
(most importantly, a switchblade)

Saying that if I I didn’t close my mouth and shut up, he would come back up or kill me

Which I complied and said that I wouldn’t talk
I made two comments to defend myself
1
“I have a knife stay back”
2
“ the police are coming they will shoot you”

I already searched up on number one
And I’m within the legal right to make that comment in a life-threatening situation
(keep in mind I had nothing but the phone on me and the clothes on my back)

He walked away and said merry Christmas. I got back on the phone with my mother
And began silently breaking apart, saying that there’s a drunk man down the road with a knife
During all this, my mother‘s boyfriend was on the phone with the police giving them updates

I began hiking my way to the health clinic
(I say hiking because it was very hard to get there in the condition the roads were in)

When I got there, they let me in, locked the doors and began treating me for mild hypothermia

After a lot of communication with social services

And the first nations authority
“NIFCIS”
And the police and firefighters to find a way to the ferry off the community
Which took about three-ish hours of back-and-forth before being able to secure a way home

( the reason why the police couldn’t come any faster because the conditions both at the community and at the closest city where a poor and they would have to take a three hour boat ride into the community and then a half an hour police car ride into the community

They said it would be likely impossible to get there within eight hours which was Ludacris in my mind as if this had gotten anything worse I would not have been helped for a long time

I got some minimal things back when my father dropped some stuff off at the fire station

All it was was a backpack full of stuff that I already knew that was in it or around it

But I’m still missing Christmas gifts

A PlayStation five

Two controllers

Clothing

And Christmas money $100

And multiple emails have been put out from my mother to ask when I’m getting this back?

And nothing yet 

The police officer came to meet me in person
And he got their side of the end they told the officer that I pushed and shoved my stepmother

The police officer also said that he would not be
Pushing anything criminally


What do I do now?

My mother and me are going to victim services on Monday dec 29th
To get a restraining order or see what will happen

I don’t wanna push criminal charges against my father, but I want to push criminal charges against my stepmother

How will I do this and get my stuff back?

Was it legal to threaten in a life-threatening situation and to say the police are going to come shoot you?

How will the stand in court?

I was a minor in all of this (15)

I need legal advice, please on how to move forward!!!!

I plan to be in Paris in March for 6 to 7 days for my birthday and looking for a boutique hotel similar to [Maison Souquet.](https://www.maisonsouquet.com/en/)

I have been there once and fell in love with their aesthetic - the dark & rich colors and wallpapers are so delightfully intimate and lively. It’s very atmospheric. I feel like most hotels go for that all white aesthetic (which sometimes I love) but I want to find a hotel that imitates that intimate dark setting with a deep vibrant color scheme or chic wallpapers - Belle Époque-esque.

The reason I am not selecting Maison Souquet this time is because I don’t think they offer rooms with terraces. I’m having a friend in my group who has never been to Paris so wanted to select a hotel that had terraces to treat her to a good view and enjoy our morning coffees. I also love the hotel’s location. I would love to find a similar hotel in either the 1st or 7th arr. but I’m not too picky!

Does anyone have any recommendations for hotels similar to Mason Souquet’s aesthetic / maximalist vibe that offer balconies/terraces? Re: price range - $2500-5000 total is good but willing to splurge.

At \~10–15 seconds/4 pumps of steam it stops abruptly (cuts out) and the clean steam wand warning light begins to flash and it does not do the normal end-of-cycle auto purge. The behaviour is intermittent over long timeframes: after months of not using steaming, it has sometimes worked for several cycles, then reverted to failing again.

What I’ve already tried:

\- Descaled the machine and thoroughly cleaned the steam wand tip holes with the pin tool.

\- Removed the steam tip/nozzle entirely and repeated tests (still cuts out in the same way).

\- Ran the steaming cycle with water only (no milk). Same problem occurs.

\- Confirmed coffee/water delivery is normal: I ran 3 lungo cycles and flow was strong and consistent each time.

\- Confirmed the steam circuit can pass water:

\-Manual purge has never had an issue and reliably pushes water through the steam wand.

\-In descaling mode I can run water through the steam wand as well.

\- The spring-loaded silver temperature sensor contact in the drip tray has a discoloured/matte patch, but pressing down on the jug during steaming makes no difference.

\- Jug placement/contact doesn’t change the behaviour.

\- After leaving the machine powered off for \~60 minutes, the problem still occurs.

\- The steam tip seals have a couple of tiny slices in them (I’m not sure if they’re significant; the issue still occurs even with the tip removed).

We spent the week together at her place, where I had already been annoying her by leaving water bottles around and snoring. Last night, things peaked when I sprayed Raid at a bug near her brewing tea. She was rightfully upset that I didn't ""think before acting"".

The ""Space"" vs. ""Caring"" Conflict:
This morning, I dropped her off and offered to stay to help her through it, but she said no. So I went home, did chores, and played video games with my roommate. Throughout the day, I sent her coffee money to let her know I was thinking about her, checked in on her periodically, and planned dinner and a movie for us. 

The Pivot:
We had a great ""make-up"" dinner tonight where we discussed our future and moving in together. But when I mentioned I played games earlier, she flipped. She says she shouldn't have to ""teach"" me to care and that my ability to have a good time while she was hurting over my mistake proves a ""disconnect"".

We’ve always had our problems. Any country, any culture, anywhere in the world has its struggles. That’s life. But doesn’t it feel like they’re somehow so much more numerous now?

I remember ten years ago. I’d wake up to birds chirping from balconies. Roosters calling. A gentle breeze through the window and the comforting feeling that even if there was something stressful ahead of me in the morning, there’d be a nice, affordable lunch and friendly people to balance it all out by midday. More stress after lunch? Not a problem, when I clock out I’ll head home in moderate traffic that doesn’t gridlock me. Maybe I’ll pick up a bite on the way home. Delivery? Nah, Time To Eat hasn’t launched yet… But that’s alright, I don’t want to pay to bring it to the door anyway. I \*want\* to drive to Serkin to have a chat with people. Hell just be \*around\* people so I can people-watch while I take my coffee.

Before then I was living on Gozo and holy shit if you want to see every issue we face as a culture and a united people… Go to Gozo now. It’s such a small place you can see every blaring issue in one afternoon. And I feel like for all of the advancements and successes we’ve made as a nation, each and every one seems to have drawbacks that make it a net loss for us.

We have convenient food and grocery delivery now. And thousands of scooters delivering it, clogging the roads, endangering themselves and others to meet delivery time expectations and to get their next commission quicker.

We have taxis now where unlike our white cabs, the prices are transparent for all and cheaper than ever. But thousands of cars marked Bolt, Uber, etc filling the roads with some of the most aggressive, fast driving I’ve ever seen. That race against the clock really inspires recklessness. I’ve taken maybe 30 of these app-cab journeys since they became widespread and not a single one didn’t have me gritting my teeth for a crash when they brake late, slam through stop signs or take corners in residential areas as though they’re sat on a crystal ball that’s guaranteeing there’s not a child playing in the street.

We’ve got faster, more reliable internet and phone connections. Fuck, remember when it was common to lose signal for a normal call, let alone access the internet? And Melita did those hotspots everywhere but if you connected to it, you were agreeing to wait 24 minutes to render half of the Google logo. And now that data connectivity has just created a weird society where every restaurant is full of tablet wielding toddlers whose parents only seem the model with no volume buttons.

And restaurants, cafes… Where’d all the good ones go? God bless the food trucks. They will be our saviours. I swear they’re the last bastion of affordable food holding back the tide up pop-up franchises selling overpriced, over complicated things that Buzzfeed Food wrote a blog post about in 2017. 

Is anyone actually buying the bao buns and enchiladas that HOG in Rabat sells for 13 euros a starter portion? Why is it actually \*rare\* now to find a place that sells a ftira for less than 10 euros? (Please for the love of god, share your food tips below. Let’s give every cafe and restaurant still serving the people good food all the business they serve so we don’t lose them.)

Now when I wake up, I’m cold and damp because the home we bought is made of recycled concrete, matchsticks and prayers… A home that would have cost us maybe 120-150 thousand in 2019 but now cost above 200.

I’m choked out by the dust of the FOUR construction sites around me, all of which are owned by the same mogul conglomerate that assembled ours. The birds have been replaced by constant drilling, sawing, hammering… Machines, trucks, horns, people screaming at each other from ground floor as the palettes of cheap bricks are hoisted up five storeys without proper restraints so they’re swinging wildly… I watched them yesterday smash a hole in the balcony they \*just\* built. A heavy lifter operator who clearly needs recertification clobbered it with a metal cement holder and then in a panic lifted it and smashed the balcony above also. Incredible really.

Saw a post yesterday asking if people are becoming more aggressive. I don’t think so. Maybe as a symptom but not as an inherent personality shift.

More than anything I think most people are just fed up with how things are. Even the people who’ve benefitted most have to live in the same polluted pond. Their lily pad might be lovely but it floats on the same shit we’re all swimming in.

And I’ve lost faith in the ability of our government to effectively govern. Not Labour, not PN, not AD or anyone else… It doesn’t feel like there’s an option. Both parties will do \*some\* good things and \*many\* worthless things. Our politicians are destined to fail and to fall to the same curse that’s killing industry titans worldwide: the plague of inept middle management.

No consequence, no oversight, no enforcement, no accountability… It doesn’t matter what laws or fixes the government does, some lazy idiot won’t send the email, sign the letter, photocopy the document, publish the whatever… And their boss won’t penalize them for it and \*their\* boss won’t question why nothing’s working and \*THEIR\* boss is 68 now and working extra years without retirement to desperately try to get a liveable pension together so they’re also just coasting.

I don't know what I'm talking about and have just spent some time googling the situation. I'm hoping for some insight into this situation. I'm aware that warts can incubate for years, but it seems this is unusual for ring warts?

**Photos in comments**

**TLDR:**

Treating a palmar wart, 8 months post OTC cyrotherapy an annular arrangement of common warts appeared at the location of treatment. (I believe this is the ""ring wart"" or ""donut wart"" phenomenon), and when I look up case studies I get the impression the incubation period is typically weeks rather than months? 

Highlighting the more potentially relevant medical/lifestyle information:

* Around April of 2025 my work shifted to that of a much more physical job where there may have been regular trauma to that part of my hand.
* With hyperhidrosis my palms are almost constantly at least mildly wet.
* I have OCD related compulsions that lead me to shower for 1-3 hours every day.
* My diet is quite poor, though I try to take a multivitamin and my labs always come back fine, perhaps my immune system could be better.

---------

**Timeline:**

* Late 2024. wart appears on the palm side of the purlicue, growing to about 4mm in diameter.
*November 2024. I treat the palmar wart with OTC cyrotherapy. Wart blisters and after some weeks heals completely.
* July 2025. 8 months later I notice small papules appear annularly around the location where the initial wart was located. Unlike the initial wart, these were smooth in texture with no visible thrombosed capillaries. I believed it was granuloma annulare for several months. But it seems it was actually a cluster of common warts that eventually grew into a plaque with a central clearing. 
* Late November 2025. It began to develop a keratin layer and fissure with momentarily bleeding. I mascerated and pared (apparently excessively) and revealed the thrombosed capillaries. 
* Early October 2025. I used cyrotherapy (excessively). The mosaic of common warts. Seemed to be damaged significantly, but did not blister. 
* Now. It appears about 60% of the warts have been successfully removed. But 40% have returned. I just attempted another attempt at cyrotherapy, however this time it seems to have been less potent so I'm pessimistic. I plan on attempting the process of macerating, paring, solicylic acid, then occluding after waiting some time for the initial information to go down.

* Psyc stuff: ADHD, OCD, MDD, GAD, AvPD, Panic disorder with agoraphobia. Pursuing ASD evaluation.

Med list:

* Vyvance (ADHD), 
* Amlodipine (Raynauds mainly, but does probably help BP), 
* Propranolol (Vyvance caused tachycardia, this removed it. And for anxiety), 
* Montelukast (for allergies, eliminated the asthma mostly),
* Trintilix (depression)
* Busbirone (anxiety), 
* Quetiapine (sleep), 
* Lamotrigine (depression),
* Lithium (suicidal ideation).
* I also take a multivitamin and an omega 3 supplement.

* CBC with diff and CMP always come back within normal ranges for my annual PCP appointments. Only thing that is ever a little off is my albumin/globulin ratio. Last time it was checked: albumin high at 5.4, globulin low at 1.6, albumin/globulin ratio high at 3.4

I do not seek one night stands or other ways to get a quick sex, because it is not my main intension to find a GF. But also, when I tried to research the dating culture over here, I came across multiple opinions that women here expect seriousness and quick marriage (I am open to serious relationships, but not rushing life decision such as marriage). As my intuition, I believe that HCMC is more progressive that Hanoi or rural areas, and also that reality is much more complicated than ""Every woman wants marriage"" (and also that most of literature and posts are written by people in their 30s, that are not from my generation and are far more conservative than me or people in Vietnam in their 20s)  
  
I also wanted to ask about social norms around meeting people. I like cafés and coffee shops, but I’ve noticed that women usually go there with friends or for studying. Is it generally considered okay to approach someone in that setting, or is that seen as intrusive, especially if they’re not alone?

Dating apps don’t really appeal to me, mostly because I prefer more organic connections and clearer intentions, but I’m open to hearing different opinions on that too.

My name’s Levi, I’m 21 and live in Orange County, NY. I’m mainly looking to make real friends — people to text, talk about life with, and if you’re local, hopefully hang out too. Texting-only is totally fine as well.

I’m pretty chill and thoughtful — I like deeper conversations but I also enjoy just talking about random everyday stuff. I’m big into food and coffee, and I love cooking and baking. I collect vinyl records, watch a lot of movies, and enjoy cozy nights just as much as going out for good food.

I’m open to friends of any gender, preferably within about 10 years of my age. All I ask is that you’re genuine — ghosting is kinda rough, and dry one-word replies make it hard to connect.

If any of this sounds like your vibe, feel free to DM me directly. Happy to chat 🙂",1,1766898575.0,friendship,1,1.0,False
1pxiyc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1pxiyc3/morning_yoga_klpd_why_do_guys_behave_like_this/,Morning Yoga & KLPD; why do guys behave like this?,"So here is the story.

I went on to try a new type of Areal yoga. Apparently its a new form of yoga where you use a hammock, search Areal yoga if you want to know more. It was listed on an app that promotes such activities.

Its a cafe cum Yoga studio, you have to enter from the cafe. Nice Ambience, trainer looked professional, talked nicely, I reached early so showed my interest in knowing more if I like this trial session.

Everything is going fine, we are 3 guys and an avg looking gal, so far trainer is paying equal attention to everyone. A new hot girl enters, dressed in a bodyfit yoga dress and the atmosphere changed.

Suddenly our nice trainer is all over her, 100% personal attention while me and other poor fellas are hanging upside down, looking up to him to explain what's next. To sum up, in one hour of session, 40 minutes went to this gal and rest everyone might have received 20 minutes of trainer. Mind you, it was first or second session for most participants so everyone needed help.

After the session was over, he continued talking to her. Though, I had already lost interest thanks to this unprofessional behavior, but still curious to know the packages and all. Waited for few seconds to get his glance but he was giving his 100% to her, explaining packages and in between also mentioned **""yahan sub kuch me hi hu""**, so the gal fires next question, oh **so you are the owner? no, no I am one of the leading trainer here**. There you go, perhaps this is the one answer she wanted to hear; she abruptly says thank you and excuses from there.

As I mentioned earlier, we entered from cafe. The trainer follows the gal perhaps looking to take the discussion forward or ask her for a coffee, but guess what, she already has a guy (perhaps her boyfriend, who waited for her in the cafe for the entire hour) sitting in the cafe, she goes straight to him and hugs him in front of the trainer.

I enjoyed the look on his face with a proper Haha wali smile. Of course the gal knew how to cash in the attention, but why guys behave this way?",10,1766898568.0,AskIndianMen,6,1.0,False

1pxixtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pxixtt/i_work_at_the_consignment_shop_on_main_street_4/,I work at the consignment shop on Main Street. (4),"**Friday, August 1st, 7:30 pm**

Day one of our plant festival. Mr. Shriner hired some teenager to watch the shop this weekend so I could do the kettle corn stand. However, I feel like it makes more sense to hire the kid for the kettle corn and leave me to my air conditioned shop. Safe to say, not into it but whatever.

So, I dressed myself in as much linen as possible, gave Demeter some extra kibble and headed out the door early to set up. Because Mr. Shriner is a traditionalist, I had to load 2 huge copper kettles into the truck of my car and hope my strap job stopped them from bouncing out. When I pulled in, Markus and Cami were just starting to unpack their car as well so we chatted for a moment.

Cami makes the crystal sun catchers remember? Her table is always some form of divination, but she switches it up every year. This year, she went with palm reading and pendulums.

I don’t think I’ve introduced you to Markus yet. He’s a younger guy, works at the elementary school as the gym teacher. He does the muscle work for the fair. Setting up tables and booths, moving stock, all the things you’d expect from a young buff meathead. I say that with love of course, but he’s closer to being a camp counselor kind of man then your stereotypical jarhead gym teacher.

I helped Cami pop up her booth while Markus McMuscles moved the kettles to my stall for me. By the time he came back, Cami was set up, and Markus and I were all soaked in sweat. I said my goodbyes and tootled off to finish unpacking.

After several trips to the car, I got everything to my booth, started to put it away, heat up my kettles all the fun stuff.. So I get the gas going and turn around to set out my kernels and my flavors, and I managed to only grab what I needed for caramel, not Jed Mei’s snow. I still don’t have a clue where that comes from or what flavor it is. Maybe it’s white like snow?  If we would have stuck with caramel and cinnamon-caramel, this wouldn’t be an issue but I digress. So day one is only gonna be caramel flavored.

Things went really well for a few hours. The mayor did her speech to open the festival, and the rides all started in a jarring scream of calliope and neon lights. Kids came up with their pocket money or their parents credit cards and walked away with bags of kettlecorn as big as they are. I seen some happy customers leave Cami’s tent, and even Rooter showed up for a few minutes. He stopped in and bought a bag to take to Sara and Loretta before heading to the cemetery.

Then things went weird. *oooOOOooo*. Realistically, I think it was heat stroke. It’s August.

So the festival is set up in the center of town, in a large paved plaza. In the middle of the plaza is a huge statue that’s been here since the town was founded. Not of the founder, like the one in the simpsons’ mind you. It’s a carving of a huge tree with the front of it missing. Kinda like a doorway you know? There’s a figure standing in that doorway, wearing long robes covered in leaves and a mask that looks kinda like this little tree guys from legend of Zelda, with a little branch kicking off the side and everything.

Karen and her husband were selling her oils across the plaza from me. I could see their table, and they didn’t have a gazebo or anything to keep the sun off of them. Her husband has been steadily sipping tall boys all morning, so he was at the very least buzzed. Karen was putting drops of some oil in every time he looked away from a new can. What was she putting in their coffee last week? Jamsonweed for mental clarity or something? I don’t think that’s going to negate the whole pounding beer all morning but whatever.

By noon, he had finished a six pack, and I didn’t see him drink anything else. So Ralph is sitting there, mildly buzzed and listening to his wife chatter when his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. He starts to mumble, trying to get his wife’s attention as he pushes back in his camping chair. Karen; in the midst of an ever important sale, ignores him until he goes “ass over teacups” as my mom says. Ralph flipped backwards in his chair, throwing his beer away from him in the process. He lands flat on his back, and keeps trying to push himself away, pointing at something in front of the table. Karen finally gives him attention, and tries to help him off the ground but he kept pushing her away, trying to crawl away until he backed himself against a tree. A few people rushed over to him, so my view was blocked but I could hear him start screaming. Something about redemption and reclamation of what is owed. Someone called an ambulance as soon as he started to vomit a black gooey stuff and started seizing. They rolled him on his side, and someone held Karen out of the way. Bless her, she was so scared.

It didn’t take long for the ambulance arrive thankfully, and they were both loaded in and taken away before he got worse. He hadn’t drank or ate anything but beer for hours, sitting in the hot August sun, so it’s not terribly surprising he got so sick so quick. I hope he feels better soon though.

Cami and I packed up Karen’s table for her and put it in her car. I scribbled out a note saying I had her keys and her purse and to call me when she’s ready for them, but if I don’t hear back tomorrow I’ll give a call.

The rest of the day went well beyond a weird vibe hanging in the air. I sold out on corn about an hour before anticipated, so I took a stroll around the other booths before I packed up. Ended up buying a new toy for Demeter and a cute cigar band ring for myself. It looks kind of like Rooter’s now that I look at it.  But the carving is an eye with a lil flame in it and the stone is a transparent orange instead of a deep green tree. It almost glows, isn’t that neat?

**Sunday, August 3rd, 2:39 am**

Is heat stroke contagious? Can heat stroke cause mass hysteria? Today was fucking nuts. I don’t know what happened but I lost my mind again. A lot of us did.

So I got up, got ready and left at the same time as yesterday, but I remembered Mr. Mei’s special blend this time. I even grabbed an extra bag of corn since I sold out early yesterday. Karen’s booth is gone when I arrived and someone else took her spot selling custom tumblers and those 3D printed dragons. Her car was gone too, but I still had her keys so she must have parked in a bad spot and got towed. I heard her husband was still hospitalized, so she’s probably not too concerned yet.

So, rinse and repeat of the process yesterday. I start to heat the kettle, unpack my supplies, say hi to Cami (who brought me a saffron latte. I could kiss that woman) and Markus, and start popping corn. I did up a batch of caramel first and bagged that, hanging it on the hooks by the window. Then I popped open the cartons of Jeb Mei’s snow and my entire field of vision is covered in this tacky, off white powder that smells like… composting plants is the closest I can get you. It was absolutely disgusting and stuck to everything it touched. So I get that batch going and try to wipe everything clean but the powder just kind of transfers to my gloves so I keep having to change them. I blow through a pile of gloves in five minutes, but I did manage to get things cleaned up. So I bag up our mystery flavor, and hang that up in my windows for display.. Things are ok, maybe a bit warmer than I would have liked. I start selling bags of both flavors, things are great.

I sell out of the first batch and start on the second when my hands start to tremble a little. Ok, it’s hot, so I start chugging my water and get back to work. Across the plaza, I hear a rattling scream. Then another, another, and another. When I look up, there’s several small pockets of people on their knees, screaming and collapsing to the ground, frothing at the mouth or gawking at the heavens above. Their friends watch in horror as they writhe around.

I glance over at Cami, and she’s on her knees, her face raised to the sky, just like everyone else. I try to rush over to her in case she starts to seize too but my legs won’t let me move. I drop down just like everyone else, staring up to what should be clouds, but instead is the greasy ceiling of my booth.

Cami starts to shriek, joining the horrid harmony of the poor other souls.

Being on the floor, I can’t exactly see anything even if my legs would move but I feel like I can hear everything around me.

The screaming starts to turn into a droning hum as people congregate in the center of the plaza around the big statue. They sort of congeal around it and their sound begins to change from that communal drone to speaking in tongues and begging for redemption.

My legs start to twitch under me, as if they have a mind of their own. I start to stand, being pulled to the statue myself. As I approach it, I feel the air vibrate, pulling me closer to it, until I’m trying to push myself through the masses at the marble base to touch it and praise her. Cami is on my left, a shambling mess covered in…. Soot? Why does she have soot bleeding out of her nose? They all do.  I jerk my head down to see the front of my shirt covered in soot and ash. *We* all do. A spark climbs up my spine, jerking my head back up towards the statue. I meet her eye, and begin to beg. I didn’t know the statue was a woman, but *she* felt like a benevolent soul I must appease.

The tone of our congregation suddenly shifts, and people are pulling each other out of the way, trying to touch it. I watch my own hands grab the collar of the woman in front of me and pull her to the ground. She sells earrings a few booths from Karen. I quickly take her spot, leaving her lying on the ground in this undulating mass of limbs and soot.

Someone pushes up behind me and I hear a sharp crack before the woman releases a feral scream that quickly peters out. *We* don’t care. No one stops to help her. We’re fighting for the right to touch the base of this weird statue.

As soon as my fingers graced the marble base, a surge of power that felt ancient and earthy launched up my arms and sends me into a frenzy. I clammer back into the crowd, letting the people behind us get a taste if they can manage to stay upright. If they fall, they’re underfoot and probably stepped on. With no control over my body, I rush for the nearest structure and begin to claw at the siding, trying to tear it apart with my bare hands. I think it was an enclosed gazebo where teenagers hid in to smoke pot at night. The wood planks had that plant smoke smell embedded in them and it felt like an offense to *her*. I don’t even know who *she* is but I needed to please her. I keep tearing at the boards until something becomes loose and falls to the ground then I move to the next one, this dryadic power telling me to destroy the structure because it’s an offense to *her* and what she’s provided for the town. I hear someone next to me, trying to do the same to appease *her* and win her favor. My body begins to grow heavy and slow at this point, and I think I blacked out.

When I came around again, it was dark outside. The streetlights had come on, and the entire plaza was absolutely destroyed except the statue. Booths and tables had been flipped, the gazebo was missing boards and covered in dark wet streaks. Something had been on fire at one point, but now it was just a pile of smoldering ashes, the smoke hanging in the air. Hopefully unconscious bodies are scattered around, some twitching a little and some totally still. The woman I had pulled down is still in a crumpled pile at the base of the statue, and I couldn’t bring myself to go see if she’d alive or not.

I pushed myself to my feet again and try to stay upright but my entire body feels like it’s on fire. My fingertips feel raw, I’m down at least one finger nail and maybe a few fingerprints entirely. I all but crawl to my car and climb in, patting around for my keys. Despite the utter chaos of the day, my keys never fell off my belt. This is why we have carabiners people. I crept home, grossly under the speed limit until I pulled into the back of the shop. I drug myself upstairs and crashed on my couch with Demeter on my chest for a few hours.

I just woke up again, and I needed to write this down. This entire day was fucking crazy and I don’t know what happened but I’m not the only one that lost my mind. Enough people went nuts and caused destruction, we hurt people and someone started fires. The plaza was an absolute mess and I have no idea what caused it. I don’t know why we wanted to touch the statue. I don’t know who she is. I’m scared.  I’m going back to bed.

**Sunday, August 3rd, 9:48 am**

The festival is canceled. But not from the mass hysteria or anything. There’s now an open investigation for embezzlement on the planning committee. And get this… The plaza is totally untouched. The gazebo is fine. No scorched piles of something. No people laying in the grass. All the ash and soot and everything is gone and sparking clean. But I’m still missing a goddamn nail. I don’t know what’s happening.

1pxiwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pxiwow/i_have_to_work_to_remember_all_of_the_positive/,"I have to work to remember all of the positive human connections, and sometimes I feel utterly invisible.","As someone who has worked with children and their parents for 25 years, I would say that I have had more than my fair share of positive human interaction. I know there are many people who love me, and I know that I am a good person and that I am lovable. 

(In Christian summer camp in Oregon in the 70s, we even made pendants out of slices of wood and gimp {plastic lanyard cord}, in decoupage, no less, {we used shellac}, with the letters IALAC: I Am Lovable And Capable. Why am I sobbing right now? Those letters never did sink in, really. But I always loved camp, and always cried on the last day.)
  
(don't worry, that's not code. i'm just having a moment)
  
That being said, I have to work to remember all of this positive human connection, and sometimes I feel utterly invisible. Today, for example, when crossing the street on a green light, a car with tinted windows (I couldn't see the driver at all to make eye contact) turned left when I was well into the intersection. I put my arm up (I'm not a small person) and had to take 4 full steps backwards, fast, (I don’t do fast), and I could feel the draft from the car that missed me by an inch, and slowed down not at all. It was like I didn't exist. 
  
Or at the store this evening, standing literally in the middle of the entrance waiting to put my cart away, and people moved around me as if I was not there. And when I did sense an opening and moved forward the slightest bit, someone surged by me and glared as if I had tried to ram them. I had moved about an inch at that point. I then waited even longer until there was a movement to act. Moving with care (and with dyspraxic, intentional motor planning) or any hint of hesitation was not an option. 
  
Somehow these moments of invisibility effect me more deeply than when people are outright rude or hostile. Somehow, hostility makes more sense to my nervous system than not being seen. Living, as I do, in a big giant man disguise, I've become familiar with the ways that it makes sense for some people to show hostility. I try not to take it personally. But I seem so obvious, at least to my self. I can't be invisible in the times when I want to be, so when I am, it's unsettling. 
  
(Sorry, I'm just falling apart, here, remembering when I was about 7 years old, and I called my Uncle Keith on the phone, and I had never heard an answering machine before, and when I heard his voice on the line I kept trying to get his attention: ""But Uncle Keith! It's me! Ricky!"" My auntie and my Naná tried to explain it to me, but I was inconsolable for a while, kind of like now)

(Some of us don't grow out of it)

Then there are the times (this hasn't happened during the holidays, when it would make sense), when I run into someone I haven't seen for a while, and we have a nice conversation, and they say ""let's get a coffee sometime,"" and then I'll follow through in a light way so as not to trigger obligation: ""great to see you. I've got some time next week if you're free, otherwise, let me know a good time for you,"" and then I never hear from them. This actually happens fairly often. Sometimes I even summon the courage to try again months later, and crickets. 
  
I do my best not to take it personally, because I know everyone is time-poor and every interaction creates an obligation and an offset that must be recouped at some other time in the week. It's like running into a friend in the car next to you on the freeway, but their lane is moving faster than yours.  And then you text them the next day: ""so cool to see you!"" and get no response (true story).

Ghosting, or non-response, has become normalized. For someone whose nervous system is wired for connection, and who builds his schedule around being available, I have never felt more invisible. It's like we're living in a post-relational world. 

(It's like I was wired for a particular purpose, that appears to be no longer purposeful)
  
I know I am extra sensitive, because of my particular nervous system. I also know that there are many people with nervous systems like mine who have not been blessed with all of the warmth and positive interactions that I have been so privileged to experience who are having a hard time these days. 
  
(or maybe I actually am neither lovable nor capable, which would be a simple explanation for the whole shebang, so there’s that)
  
All of this just a long-winded way to say be kind to one another, and I hope you have the wiggle room to text back the friend you see in the car next to you on the freeway.

My counselor showed me a fun little game. It's called the ABC game. Before you roll your eyes at me and call bullshit. I have been dealing with awful, and probably life threatening illness which has caused a myriad of problems. Including severe SI, I have to roll my eyes when I go to appts, but just getting through a few minutes is you trying and you working through the traumas of life.
It's called the ABC game. And it has helped me through countless episodes. 
You base the game around an object, and locating an object in your line of vision, your area, starting with an A... like.... an Android or an Apple phone for instance , once you locate that object, you take a moment and then you just let it process. Reward yourself for finding that object, that takes effort., then you move on to B, find a object that starts with a B, ... a bench, a bowl, remember to slowly process everything in your area and remember to reward yourself for finding that object. That takes effort whether you believe it or not. Then find an object that starts with a C, "" and this one's easier"" A chair, a couch, a coffee cup, a computer. But always remember to take it slowly when you are playing the game. You can base this game on objects, car brands, people, but i found it easiest with objects. Just a random ass posting here.

Throwaway, and obviously minor details have been changed. 


So my boyfriend and I have been together for just over four years. He recently moved to an apartment with a higher rent, so obviously things have changed. We don't go out as often, and when we do, I tend to foot the bill. After rent and bills, I now have more ""expendable"" income, so I'm more than okay with that. But this particular situation has me kind of miffed.


Every year for my birthday he makes a big deal out of taking the night off work so we can have dinner together, and after dinner he takes me to Pandora to pick out a new charm for my bracelet. It's a cute little tradition. 


So a week before my birthday, I was joking around with him and trying to find out where we were going for dinner. He said we weren't going anywhere because he had to work. I teased him about it, because he says that every year so he can ""surprise"" me by picking me up from work. He snapped at me and said we couldn't do anything for my birthday, because he really did have to work because he's broke and has no money to spare for extra things. I apologized, and said it was fine, we'd spend some time together on the weekend and have pizza in bed because all I wanted was to spend some time with him. 


My birthday was last Thursday. He worked, and after work he called me to say happy birthday and he was sorry he couldn't afford to do anything or get me a present. I said it was fine, and I couldn't wait to see him on Saturday so we could spend the day together. And then he told me he wouldn't see me until the evening because he got a ticket to a festival and he was going with one of his buddies. I was kind of taken aback, but I knew he hadn't seen his friend in a while because he's been working so much. 


So Saturday night comes, and he comes over after his festival. And he's got three bags of stuff in his arms. I asked him about the festival, and he tells me what a great time he had. And then he proceeds to empty out the three bags worth of merchandise he got at the festival. And that's when I started to internally fume. Because he's taking shirts and things out of the bags and being like ""I got this, oh it was only $10. And I got this one, but it was only $15, and this one, and this one was $X, etc"". And he's listing how much he paid for this stuff. Overall he spent about $200 on festival merch. 


I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say. Our usual birthday tradition (not including gas) usually runs less than $150. I know it wasn't his intention, but all I could think was ""you could spend $200 at a festival for yourself but nothing for my birthday??"" 


I feel so selfish for thinking it, but I also still feel so upset inside. I saw him yesterday and he was wearing one of his festival shirts and seeing it made me fume all over again.

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend breaks birthday tradition because he says he's strapped for cash. Goes to a festival and comes back with $200+ worth of merchandise. I'm peeved, but am I overreacting?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**When told the bf is broke, so give him a break**

**OOP**

>I'm not mad that he didn't get me a present. I'm not mad that he bought himself some festival merch. If he had said ""I've got this festival coming up and it's gonna cost me a pretty penny. Do you mind if we do something else for your birthday?"" I would have been totally fine with it. Instead, I'm mad that he made a HUGE deal out of being broke just to turn around and spend a chunk of change on something else. 

**And to a similar deleted commenter**

> I would have been totally fine if he had said he wanted to do something low key so he had some extra spending cash for the festival. He works hard, and he deserves to spend money on himself.
>
> I just felt so awful for poking him about birthday plans after he said he was broke so we couldn't go out. And then he comes back and basically tells me he spent so much money at the festival. 

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/fS4PGEuhJg)  **Aug 10, 2015 (over 2 weeks later)**


I'm sorry this is jumbled.

So, I haven't talked to him about the festival/birthday fiasco. I actually haven't seen him in over two weeks. Not actually on purpose, I've had some events planned for months that were gonna fill up my weekends. He's known this. 

I see a therapist once a month, I have since I was a kid. I talked to her about my frustrations a few days after I made the original post and I ended up breaking down in tears. He's been treating me less like a girlfriend and more like a sugar momma. And when I thought about it I realized that it's been going on for MONTHS. I feel used and numb. I feel stupid for not realizing it until now. 

While I was busy and not seeing him, I took a mental break from him to attempt to think clearly. Figured it wouldn't be too hard since I'm always the one who contacts him first. I think he realized I was pulling away. He started texting me like he was in the beginning of our relationship. Good morning texts, random ""just thinking about you"" messages, you know, the fluffy messages you get when you're in the honeymoon stage. I started to think maybe everything else was just a phase or I was over thinking things.

But actions speak louder than words. He said he missed me, and said he wanted to come to Saturday's event. Friday night, he asked what time it started and where it was being held. I told him, and he said he couldn't wait to see me. I looked for him. He never showed up. I felt so disappointed and heartbroken. I didn't hear from him at all until I had posted a pic on instagram about finally being home. He said he was sorry he didn't see me, he was just busy. I know from his roommate that he was at home playing video games. 

He used to be this sweet romantic. He'd swing by work just to drop off a muffin and coffee from my favorite place, come over at 1am to help me with my trig. When I broke my arm, he'd come over during his lunch break to help me wash and brush my hair. He used to be my biggest support system. 

I see him next weekend. I plan on telling him everything I've been feeling lately. Depending on his reaction, he'll either get a second chance, or I'll break up with him. I can't be in this relationship if it keeps going like this. I am not good at being alone, it's been a fear of mine, so I know there's a chance I'll chicken out of breaking up with him. But I don't know how much longer I can do this.

TL;DR: Haven't talked to boyfriend about the birthday/festival fiasco, but have come to realize some things about our relationship. I feel used and numb. Unless something changes drastically, we're headed for splitsville.

[Final update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/VdH23PBVLt)  **Aug 16, 2015 (6 days after last update)**

I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who’s commented, both on my update and on the original post. Having all those words of advice in my head definitely made this easier. 


Spoiler alert: I dumped him.


Backtracking here, let’s go from the top. 


I was planning on bringing up our issues and my feelings on the car ride home from the family event. I’ll say it now, it was his nephew’s birthday party. I like his family, so I didn’t want to stir the pot before the event. So we went to the party, we had a great time. He was attentive, and sweet, just like when we started dating. We get in the car, talk a little bit about the party, and then we had a lull in conversation. I took a breath to say something, but before I could get a word out he said he had something he needed to say. 


He said he felt bad about the way he’d been treating me the past few months. He said he felt like he’d been a terrible boyfriend basically since Christmas. He said he felt bad about me paying for things and that he hadn’t been making time for me. There was more to it, but that’s the TL;DR version of the speech. He was supposed to be taking me back to my place, but he made a turn I wasn’t really familiar with. I asked him where we were going, he said “you’ll see”. 


We ended up at a mall. He parked the car, he opened my door. I asked what we were doing there, and he said he wanted to make up for my missed birthday plans, so he was taking me to Pandora to pick out a charm. Honestly, I thought it was sweet. I thought the past few months were a phase and they were over. And then I asked what made him think of doing it now, since my birthday was almost a month ago.


He admitted he saw my post here(I didn’t even know he was on reddit), and when he read it he was 98% sure that it was about us. Since I made the original post weeks ago, I did ask if he read the update. He said he had, and that that was why he was taking me to Pandora. That’s when it stopped being sweet. I said “so basically, you’re buying me jewelry because I said I was done with the way you’ve been treating me and was thinking about breaking up with you?” He didn’t really give me a response. So I asked again. “Are you seriously attempting to make up for breaking the birthday tradition because you saw my I was thinking about breaking up? You haven’t even apologized!”


And then he said “I’m sorry you think I’m selfish because I bought myself some shit at a festival. Happy?”


He wasn’t even really apologizing, he threw it back on me. He was only doing this to shut me up so we wouldn’t have to actually talk through our issues and I wouldn’t break up with him. I told him that if he had actually read the post he’d know that I wasn’t upset about the birthday tradition, I was upset that he blew me off, and upset that we hadn’t spent time together. I told him I was tired of feeling like a bank and not a girlfriend, and he threw it back in my face, saying I wasn’t allowed to say that because I had offered to pay for things. 


I told him he could leave, I was calling my brother to pick me up. He told me to stop being ridiculous. I started walking away, and he grabbed my wrist. He's never been physical with me like this. And he was clutching my wrist and digging his nails into my skin. I told him to let go, he told me to get in the car because I was making a scene. I kept telling him to let go of me. He said “you’re acting fucking crazy, just get in the damn car!” 


I kicked him. He let go enough that I managed to twist my arm out of his grip, and I ran into the mall. I hid in a dressing room. I locked the door behind me, and then I lost it. I sat on the floor sobbing. I didn’t even realize I had run right past an attendant until someone knocked on the door and asked if I needed any help. I couldn’t even respond in a human fashion, I think I just blubbered at her. She pushed a packet of tissues under the door. I don’t know how long I sat on that floor crying. 


I finally realized I needed to get home, so I went to call my brother. I had about thirty missed calls and even more messages. You can guess who they’re from. I didn’t read them all. I sent him one message: **”We’re done. You can drop off my stuff Monday when I’m at work. ALL of it. I don’t want to see you or speak to you ever again. WE. ARE. DONE.”** I now have him blocked on all forms of social media, and I’m working up to blocking his number. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend saw my reddit post, tried to buy me out of breaking up with him. When I called him out on it, he got physical. He’s now my ex-boyfriend. Eat shit, Derek.

1pxioho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1pxioho/found_out_she_was_cheating_on_christmas_vacation/,Found out she was cheating on Christmas Vacation,"Just celebrated 18 years, 2 kids together…I haven’t been the best in the entire relationship.  But in the past 5-6 years I’ve done a lot of self work, lost 120 pounds, went to therapy, mitigated my temper issues to the point that the kids called it out positively to multiple family members.  A couple years ago a coworker and I got closer than my wife preferred…even though the coworker was 2,000 miles away.  I worked to atone for whatever missteps I made there, cut off communication with the coworker, changed jobs, making well over 6 figures.  In the past 2 years I’ve worked to be more present, buy her more flowers, help around the house, take an interest in the small (and big) passions she has…which includes the online gaming community she keeps relatively secret.  I’ve noticed a change in the past 6 months, spending more time on her phone, watching her face light up when she gets messages in a way I had never seen before.  She keeps her phone guarded and doesn’t share passwords.  She encouraged us to go to one my favorite places in the mountains for Christmas vacation.  I paid for the whole trip even though we make relatively the same salary (with the new job I make a little more). She felt bad that she is “tapped” financially right now, so when we got to the cabin I reassured her everything would be fine and I would pay for anything she needed.  Wine, dinners out, liquor, candy, coffee, dessert runs.  

We were on the second to last night of the trip and she fell asleep on her phone.  I ignored the multiple nights in the past months where I’ve seen her get on her phone in the middle of the night.  When I woke up in the middle of the night last night my arm hit her phone.  I was going to just put it on the nightstand but (against…or maybe in favor of my better judgment) I read what was on the screen.  I didn’t have to scroll far to read the back and forth.  “Guess what” “what” “Your beautiful” “thank you babe” with multiple emoji reactions and swooning joint affirmations of love for each other.  Talks about real world things (no game based communications). I had taken her out to dinner and was staring at her earlier that night, when she asked “what” I said “nothing…you just look really pretty is all.”  She dismissed the comment from me, only to swoon over it from him.

I confronted her about it the next morning and all she said is “oh, that’s why you couldn’t sleep, are you mad?”  When I asked if she wanted to separate or tell the kids she said “until the youngest graduates or just the oldest” before walking away. 1,000 miles from home, with both of the kids in tow…all I want to do is light a dynamite stick and blow up their perception of her in her face.  But one child’s anxiety and depression along with too many similar experiences from my childhood are preventing me from doing anything.  Don’t expect any answers…just needed to vent.

I'm a 41-year-old guy looking to build some real friendships. I work in tech, and I'm into stuff like building things with wood or 3d printing or electronics, partner dancing, board games, I'm always learning a new thing by taking classes i love to learn so bonus points if you can teach me something.

I have chronic pain that makes dating complicated and honestly not something I'm pursuing right now. I'm genuinely just looking for friends, people to grab coffee with, work on projects together, play games, or eventually hit some trails when my back cooperates.

What I'm looking for: People who actually want to build friendships, not just show up to one event and disappear. I'm looking for the kind of friends who text first sometimes, suggest plans, and actually want to hang out - not just acquaintances I see at group things.

Things we could do:
Coffee hangouts and actual conversations
Board game nights (I go to some meetups but honestly looking for more genuine connection than those provide)
Swing dancing (I take lessons, always fun to have people to go with)
Working on electronics/coding projects if that's your thing we can collaborate 
Easy walks/hikes within my current capacity (working on building back up to longer trails)
Whatever you're into, I'm open to new stuff.

Full disclosure: I have bipolar disorder (you might see it mentioned in my comment history). I was diagnosed years ago, I take my meds, and I plan to keep taking them because they keep me stable. I'm putting this out there because I'd rather be honest upfront than have it be a surprise later. To be honest if I notice symptoms i tend to keep to myself and rarely does it last long. I manage it well.  If that's a dealbreaker for you, no hard feelings, but if you're cool with it, I promise I'm a pretty good friend.  I'm willing to answer any question you have about it too.
I'm looking for people in their 30s-50s in the Vancouver/Burnaby area who want actual friendship, not just networking or activity buddies. Men and women both welcome.  I'm just trying to build a real friend group.

\- Very Fashionable (I always dress to impress in every occasion EXCEPT at home)  
\- Values Healthy Living - I'm on STRICT Carnivore Diet, NEVER smoked since birth, rarely drinks alcohol, lives life stress-free/no drama, hates eating junk foods, processed foods, chips, sugary stuffs, candies, soft drinks, and too much carbs. Oh, and I hate coffee and tea too.

\- Very Organized - I always mark important events in my calendar

\- Must have no connections to any ex-boyfriends anymore (I prefer relationships that are drama-free and no one bothering us)  
\- Preferably, someone who does NOT smoke, in the process of quitting smoking, or has quit smoking altogether (I HATE the smell of cigarettes)|  
\- Drinking Alcohol is fine as long as you're NOT an alcoholic/addict  
\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)  
\- Must NOT be too nonchalant (If you don't really care about getting together and being my date, why are you even here?)  
\- Must not be too sensitive (I love making people laugh so if you're the type to easily get offended, we're NOT gonna get along)  
\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover  
\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty  
\- Hopefully, you also have good libido (This is non-negotiable for me. Bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship. If you are boring in bed and have low bedroom drive, we're NOT gonna get along)

28M hitting it off with 45F Nurse at the gym. She’s giving major green lights—is a hotel the move?


I’m 28 (Accountant) and I met this woman (45F) at my gym last week. I used a low-pressure opener, acting like I recognized her from the local hospital  It worked—she’s a nurse, divorced, and has a 9-year-old.

The Interactions:
We’ve spoken a few times now. She told me she lives with her mother and sisters, so her house is a busy environment. Yesterday, she opened up about having shoulder surgery and joked that ""it would be nice to have someone move the heavy weights around for her."" I joked back that I could be that person and I'm down whenever. She laughed and definitely seemed to like the vibe. When she left, she went out of her way to wave goodbye.

The Texts:
I texted her about my schedule being flexible but that I'm trying to get back to 10am weekday sessions. I told her I’d handle the ""heavy lifting"" for her

She responded: ""Great seeing you as well thanks I will definitely take you up on that offer."" She followed up with: ""Ok sounds good, just wanted you to know first"" regarding coordinating our Tuesday 10am workout.

The Situation:
I’m trying to satisfy her needs and get physical. Since she lives with her mom and sisters and has a kid, her place is definitely not an option. I'm 28 and fit, and I can tell there's a spark, but I want to be smooth about the logistics.

I plan to ask her out to lunch or coffee after our workouts

How likely is it that she’s looking for a hookup given the ""heavy lifting"" jokes? And since her house is full, is suggesting a hotel the right move for a professional woman her age, or is that too forward for a first time? How do I bridge that gap from a morning workout to a private room?

1pxidu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1pxidu4/medication_for_someone_who_is_very_sensitive_to/,"Medication for Someone who is very sensitive to all substances (meds, caffeine, etc)","I think I need to be medicated, mostly because since I had a kid almost 3 years ago, it has become very very hard for me to control my moods. I get irritated and snappy and sometimes yelly and then feel awful about myself and my parenting--basically like I am failing all the time. I worry and feel overwhelming guilt a lot of the time, and yet don't seem to be able to control my emotional/irritation responses, especially when I haven't slept enough, which is almost always. My life also feels very very overwhelming to me, and I feel stressed all the time. So, I want to be on meds, at least until my kid is old enough to let me sleep till 7 or 8 am regularly.

The thing that I'm worried about is that I've always been really really sensitive to medication. If I take too much advil for a prolonged period, I can get fatigue symptoms. A cortizone shot that I was told I would told I would be totally fine after left me frighteningly dizzy for the rest of the day. I can only drink decaf, and even that can make me jittery. And while I love the temporary effects of (decaf) coffee, if I rely on it too much, I get suicidal if I skip a day or reduce the amount or maybe just eventually. When I had to be on blood pressure medication after getting preeclampsia, they caused me shortness of breath and fatigue. The list goes on. If there's a side effect, I often get it. I have gravitated more towards vitamins and supplements, because of fewer side effects, and they have helped but not to the extent I want or need with this long-term lack of sleep.

I tried zoloft twice around the time my daughter was born--both times it gave me horrifying vivid nightmares. Perinatal psychiatrist *did not believe me* even though it happened both times I tried it and in the exact same way. She said it was impossible because it was a low dose and I hadn't been taking it long enough. I am 100 percent sure it was the zoloft--I never had any other nightmares like that during that time period, or maybe ever.

So, I really want meds, and want to experience the magic effects a lot of people here describe, but I am scared. Also, mixed into this is that I'm 45 and since my kid was born (at 42), my luteal phase is an absolute nightmare. My gyno just prescribed the ring to wear continuously and eliminate my periods, but it starts to fade out towards the end of the month.

Also in the mix are multiple chronic illnesses, possible MCAS, hypermobility, CFS caused either by MCAS or SIBO, which I've also been diagnosed with. Edit: Totally forgot, I also got diagnosed with dysautonomia although not sure whether POTS or something else. Tilt table test scheduled for MAY, but yes, something is weird with my blood pressure. 

I'm worried I'm going to wind up with some dismissive psychiatrist who won't understand my full profile body-wise and treat me the way the perinatal psych did.

I'm just curious if anyone has a similar systemic profile to me and did well on any particular medication. I feel like I really need to get my emotional shit together for my daughter but also that I can't risk taking a med that will throw me off either. Just trying harder has not worked.

# (Spiritual, Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Financial — parody breakdown)

# 🕊️ SPIRITUAL

* You discover spirituality does not run on autopay.
* Silence works without donations.
* Meaning stops needing proof-of-payment.
* Faith (if you keep it) becomes private again — terrifyingly effective.
* You realize conviction doesn’t send reminders.

**Parody takeaway:**  
If the sacred needs billing, it might be customer service.

# 💪 PHYSICAL

* Shoulders drop.
* Jaw unclenches.
* Sleep improves (no “did I forget something?” cortisol spike).
* Coffee tastes better when it’s not a moral compromise.
* Your body stops bracing for invisible consequences.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Your nervous system prefers choice over obligation.

# ❤️ EMOTIONAL

* Guilt loses its job.
* Relief shows up quietly.
* Self-trust increases.
* You stop rehearsing apologies no one asked for.
* You feel generosity again — not pressure.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Real kindness doesn’t threaten you when you pause it.

# 🧠 MENTAL

* Fewer justifications.
* Less magical accounting.
* No retroactive meaning assignment.
* Clearer thinking without “cause and effect” gymnastics.
* You reclaim mental bandwidth previously leased out monthly.

**Parody takeaway:**  
Clarity improves when fear-based math is removed.

# 💰 FINANCIAL

* Money stays where you put it.
* Emergencies feel less dramatic.
* Choice replaces obligation.
* Giving becomes intentional instead of ritual.
* You remember: *it was always your money.*

**Parody takeaway:**  
Your wallet doesn’t need enlightenment — it needs honesty.

# ☢️ FINAL PARODY VERDICT

Saying no to Zaimu does **not**:

* Break your spirit
* Curse your body
* Corrupt your mind
* Collapse your finances

It does one disruptive thing instead:

When we tried to explain that diamond painting wasn’t real painting (she was concerned about “fumes”) and why it wasn’t an issue, she called us “rude young ladies”.
