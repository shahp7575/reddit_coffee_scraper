Headaches from quite literally anything, everytime","22yrs male, noticed this issue since i was around 10yrs, headaches (almost) daily on the 2/10 pain scale, frequently higher aswell (and 10/10 when i get bad migraines, but atleast then i know what the diagnosis is)

My main issue is that these headaches stop me from being able to progress as a person... i can't hold a job, or be encouraged to do simple things, yet i'm not very depressed because i smile often and feel genuine happiness pretty frequently, i just can't DO anything

It aches, yet i don't eat junk!

It aches, but i sleep pretty consistently!

It aches, and i drink mostly water!

It aches, but my monitors brightness is 35% and i was never chronically online!

It aches, yet i workout!

It aches, and i'm not obese/malnourished!

It aches, but i don't have any vitamin/mineral deficiencies!

It aches, yet i've tried beta-blockers, fish oils, sertaline, naproxen, norgesic, and 20 more things that i forget about!

It aches, and its not my mind playing tricks! I've been very encouraged and hopeful to try many different medications and the only thing that works so far is painkillers, yet i hate taking them!

It aches, yet i don't get withdrawals from the painkillers because there are days where i feel amazing despite having taken painkillers 3-5 days ago! I still haven't figured out why i sometimes rarely feel amazing, from what i learned, no reason at all!

It aches, yet i drink very little caffeine (like 1 cup of coffee every 2 days), and only use nicotine/alcohol since 2 years ago! (The headaches were there before this)

NOW for the stuff that consistently gives me short headaches (2 or 4 pain scale, lasts until i answer my body's needs)

-Cold air through my nose

-Haven't eaten in 8 or 12 hours

-Very dry air around

-Too little sleep

-Too much sleep

-Bright lights, monitors on full brightness, too much sunlight

-Stress/anxiety obviously (sertaline would've fixed this, this means my primary headaches are not from anxiety, plus i still have headaches when i'm drinking alcohol)

-Wearing over-ear headphones apparently",1,1738130494.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

# The Importance of Connectivity in Virtual Office Spaces

Virtual office spaces transcend geographical barriers, enabling teams and individuals to work from anywhere in the world. However, this freedom can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or a lack of engagement. Connecting members through technology helps:

* **Build a Sense of Community:** A connected environment fosters a sense of belonging, making members feel valued and supported.
* **Enhance Collaboration:** Seamless communication tools enable team members to collaborate on projects effectively, regardless of location.
* **Boost Productivity:** Streamlined processes and efficient communication channels save time and reduce misunderstandings.

# Technology Tools That Foster Connectivity

Here are some of the most effective technologies used to connect members in virtual office spaces:

* **Communication Platforms Tools** like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom facilitate real-time communication through instant messaging, video calls, and audio conferencing. These platforms create virtual meeting rooms where members can interact, brainstorm, and make decisions collaboratively.
* **Virtual Collaboration Software** Platforms such as Trello, Asana, and Miro enable teams to manage projects visually and collaboratively. Shared boards and timelines keep everyone on the same page, fostering teamwork.
* **Community-Building Apps** Dedicated apps like Mighty Networks or Discord bring members together in virtual communities. These platforms often include features like discussion forums, interest groups, and event planning to encourage networking.

* **Coworking Management Software** Tools like Optix or Nexudus provide a digital infrastructure for virtual office spaces. They offer features such as booking meeting rooms, managing memberships, and creating member directories that foster connections.

* **Immersive Technologies** The rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offers immersive experiences that replicate the feel of physical office interactions. Platforms like Spatial allow users to engage in virtual office settings, complete with customizable workspaces and real-time collaboration.

# Strategies to Maximize Member Engagement

To effectively use technology for connecting members in virtual office spaces, consider implementing these strategies:

* **Host Virtual Events and Workshops** Regular webinars, networking events, and skill-sharing sessions help members interact and learn from one another. Use platforms like Eventbrite or Hopin to organize such events.
* **Encourage Informal Interactions** Create digital spaces for casual conversations, such as virtual coffee breaks or themed discussion channels, to foster camaraderie.

* **Gamify Engagement** Introduce gamified activities like quizzes, leaderboards, or rewards for participation. This approach can motivate members to interact more frequently.

* **Leverage AI-Powered Insights**Use AI tools to analyze engagement patterns and suggest tailored recommendations to enhance participation. For example, AI can recommend relevant connections or groups to members based on their interests and activity.

# Challenges and Solutions

While technology offers immense benefits, it comes with its challenges:

* **Overcoming Digital FatigueSolution:** Encourage breaks and provide guidelines for balanced screen time. Use asynchronous communication tools to reduce the pressure of constant availability.

* **Ensuring Data PrivacySolution:** Invest in secure platforms with robust encryption and data protection measures.
* **Managing Diverse User PreferencesSolution:** Offer training sessions to help members adapt to new tools and tailor solutions based on member feedback.

# The Future of Connectivity in Virtual Office Spaces

The integration of emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and the metaverse will redefine how members connect in virtual office spaces. These innovations promise more personalized, secure, and immersive experiences, creating a cohesive digital ecosystem for professionals worldwide.

# Conclusion

By adopting the right technologies and strategies, virtual office spaces can foster meaningful connections and collaboration among members. Whether through advanced communication platforms, immersive virtual environments, or AI-driven insights, technology has the power to bridge gaps and create thriving virtual communities. Embrace these tools to transform your virtual office into a hub of productivity, innovation, and engagement.",1,1738130036.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False

2 weeks ago I find out he did a permanent sleep.

Today while making a customers cup of coffee, I poured the milk into the cup, and I happen to see the pattern the milk foam made. It made the Dagaz rune.

# DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng's New Year's Eve Post

DeepSeek梁文峰除夕夜发文

Hello, young friends. I'm Liang Wenfeng from DeepSeek. I just finished responding to one question and saw this one, so I couldn't resist replying on New Year's Eve.

When I read Mr. Feng's long post a few days ago, I was debugging the loss function of a new model, and my coffee spilled all over the keyboard—both from the awe of being recognized by a senior industry figure and from the fact that Mr. Feng's passionate words reminded me of the thrill I felt twelve years ago when I first ran a neural network in the Zhejiang University lab.

I must admit, when the team read the description of 'national-level achievement,' everyone's hair stood on end. We're just standing on the shoulders of giants in the open-source community, adding a few more screws to the building of China's large language models.

Each of the six breakthroughs you mentioned actually has a more touching story behind it: the mini-model that can run on a phone was inspired by an issue raised on GitHub by a middle school teacher in Gansu; the ability to support online search was fed by a beta user who submitted error logs at 3 am every day for thirty days.

I'd like to share a particular detail: Last week, a visually impaired developer used our API to create a 'smell navigation' app. When he demonstrated how to identify street shops through different vibration frequencies, the entire conference room was so quiet you could hear the hum of the graphics card. At that moment, my eyes welled up. I finally understood what you meant by 'water and electricity'—it's not really a particular model that is truly great, but the ripples of goodwill created by millions of ordinary people.

Mr. Feng said, 'equality of knowledge and information,' and that's exactly what drives us to stay up all night reading papers. Three years ago in a small warehouse on Yuhang Tang Road, we used a marker to write on the glass wall: 'To allow children in the most remote mountain villages to use the same intelligent AI tutor as Silicon Valley engineers.' Although we are still far from this dream, every time I see screenshots of conversations shared by netizens, I feel that all the hair I've lost is worth it.

Finally, I want to say to everyone: Please save your applause for every Chinese developer who is rewriting the rules. When you're debugging a model on the bus, drawing an architecture diagram at a breakfast stall, or having a sudden epiphany in the delivery room.

DeepSeek wants to be a match in the wilderness of everyone's code, but it is always your unquenchable curiosity and persistence that truly ignite the AI spark. Coincidentally, last week at a startup night market in Yunqi Town, I was squatting on the curb with Wang, the general manager of Unitree Technology, eating barbecue—the dynamic balance algorithm they installed on their quadruped robot made our entire team clap their hands.

Later, Han, the general manager of StrongBrain Technology, joined us at the table, and the three of us couldn't stop talking about the possible integration of brain-computer interfaces and embodied intelligence. Before the grilled eggplant even arrived, we were already drawing heterogeneous computing architectures on a piece of paper.

That's what's most fascinating about Hangzhou. The so-called 'Six Dragons' are never six isolated islands. Last month, the art director of Youke helped us debug our 3D scene generation model, while Qunhe's rendering engine is giving our digital humans more vivid micro-expressions.

Perhaps in the not-too-distant future, when Unitree's robots walk with cloud-deep gait algorithms, equipped with StrongBrain's neural interfaces, running DeepSeek's cognitive engine, and using Qunhe's constructed virtual world as a training ground—the embodied intelligence we imagine will stumble out of the morning mist of Xixi Wetland and into the world.

I remember when we parted that night, Mr. Feng stuck a toothpick into his beer bottle and said, 'You guys who do AI have to lower the price of your souls.'

Thinking about it now, true 'national fortune' may be hidden in the oily smoke of these street stalls: a group of unbelieving fools, using code as bricks, algorithms as steel bars, and stubbornly building a bridge to the future in the cracks between capital and doubt.

Finally, I'd like to add a recruitment notice. Welcome everyone to join us.

Happy New Year's Eve to everyone. We look forward to more of our models next year.",2,1738129210.0,DeepSeek,0,1.0,False

1icmsfd,https://i.redd.it/d1llsmnzcvfe1.jpeg,"Tuesday night's ""girl dinner"" after a wake up call...","Pan-seared lamb with lime, cilantro and garlic seasoned farrow, sautéed mixed squash and asparagus. 

I got a nice little wake-up call after my first blood work appointment at the age of 31 (almost 32).  Yeah, I know... 

""You're 31 and you've never had bloodwork done until now?!"" 

Yep.  

My parents never took very good care of me.  Medical and dental appointments were ""too expensive"" even though brandy and a new motorcycle apperantly weren't, most nights my dinner came from a box or can, and if I wasn't as unseen and unheard as possible, I was an inconvenience to someone.  After they divorced (I was about 11) because my father couldn't stop drinking us into credit card debt and other family members threatened to step in if my mom wouldn't stop her husband from hitting their children, my mother decided that her first post-divorce priority was to find herself a sugar daddy.  Not because she had to flatback to take care of her kids, but because she liked free gifts, nice dinners out, and liked having her ego stroked by random horny men.  I got to be the free maid and babysitter for my spoiled, violent younger brother (because she got paid to take care of the disabled child, he was always catered to), and I  was now her new personal chef when she couldn't get a date, since I was the better cook.  

One night when I was 19, just starting college and looking for part-time work, I was cooking my mom's dinner and she decided I wasn't doing it the ""right way.""  Apparently, I put the mushrooms in the pan too early for her preference, and after she spent the next five minutes telling me what a failure I was, I finally had enough.  I told her if she didn't like the way I was cooking her dinner, she could do it her damn self, and boy-oh-boy, did she not like that.  She told me that if I didn't like the way she was treating me, I could get the hell out of her house, and I did.  I called my grandmother, and after she confirmed that she had a place for me to stay, I packed what I could into a couple of trash bags, stuffed it into my car and left.  My mother was selling whatever I wasn’t able to take with me in a garage sale on her front lawn the next day.  Gotta get that side hustle I guess.

I spent the next 8 years working part time on a degree debt-free, hence out-of-pocket  from the debatable ""scam"" that is American college, then Covid hit and I decided to freelance and work hourly part time for the foreseeable future.  The whole time, I was keeping myself fed on instant ramen, convenience food and coffee for the sake of time and money, while keeping my obvious psychiatric problems buried under piles of junk food, sugar and chocolate.  I'm at the point where I was fat, sad and fast approaching 300 lbs of depression and self hatred..

Back to the blood test last week, and even though my kidneys, liver and thyroid look to be in pretty good shape due to abstaining from controlled substances and not wanting to end up like my father, the one big glaring issue is my glucose.  I'm officially pre-diabetic to no one's surprise and if I want to fix the issue, I have to cut WAY back on sugar and simple carbs and try to loose more than a few pounds.

Even though I may be a survivor of familial abuse, I don't have an excuse for continuing to abuse my own body for over another deacade, and it's on me to fix the problem I continued to cause.  At the very least, if I die sooner rather than later, I won't be around to keep taking care of Grandma, and I have to keep living if I want to keep playing Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing on the weekends, so, new me starts now.

I've spent the last week planning simple carb substitutes, pre-cutting vegetables for meal planning, sticking to black coffee and swapping soda for seltzer water.  The cravings and headaches are a pain in the ass, but oh well... Can't get through the woods if I don't keep moving forward.

In short, listen to your doctor, learn to value yourself even if no one else does, and for the love of God, eat your damn vegetables.

If anyone is curious, about the momster, she had to go back to an hourly job she hates, because the government doesn't pay her as much to take care of her own son these days, she gained back every pound of weight she lost while she was enjoying her ""hot MILF"" phase, and my unemployed, aggressive and tech addicted younger brother could eat her out of house and home if she stopped working retail for long.  Also, she does in fact, have to cook her own damn dinner now and it usually comes out of a box in the freezer.",2,1738128711.0,TheSmallVictories,0,1.0,False

Cguro if hindi, I won't go crazy about her. I'm 43 nga Pala and she is 53. As of these days, madam I ng naglalantad na mga bisexuals and LGBTs but on our age, it's very rare tlga. Either closet or taken. I am single for almost a year na and it's gets lonely. Now ko Lang din na experience manligaw. We are both femmes Pala. So ang hirap kase hindi ko Alam ang phone niya. May common friend Kane which is Cia Yung tulay namin, kaso super nag-busy na Cia kase working student Cia. 

I don't know if there are doctors here or even feminine lesbian doctors here but I hope I can get some advise. Medyo reserve kase si madam. 

I know she appreciates me pero pinapatawag niya Yung friend ko kahit on duty Para iparating sa akin ang pasasalamat. 

I started doing my moves this Jan 3 - I went there to send her my holiday gift. 

2 weeks after - I sent her a drip coffee and a vanilla flavored torani

Then every week nko nagpapadala ng gifts na may card Para meron personal touch and for me to be able to express myself kahit through letters Lang. 

Jan 22 - I sent her a paper weight na abstract with foods from Mary Grace. 

And today Jan 29 - I sent her a minimalist planner and a rose gold Parker pen. 

So weekly tlga she will get something from me, not to love bombarded her, pero masaya Lang din akobg magshoshopping for her. Whatever I have her, I always buy in 2's Para meron din ako at twinning kame. Do not get me wrong, she is a doctor and very sophisticated so I know I want to give her things that she would appreciated tlga. So ponagiisipan ko tlga, even the boxes are all customer made and the paper bags to fit everything in place. 

My plan is to visit her again for the 2nd time on Feb 12, with gifts of course... And to formally declare my good intention. 

Anybody who is introvert here, could you let me know... If you're a woman this age... Naaappreciaye nio ba mga gestures ko? 

Also today, I told her sa letter ko that I got a new number, I got 2 numbers by the ways, one for business and one kabibili ko Lang for personal kase nawala Yung business phone ko. 

I wish tlga one of this days mag text na Cia, so communication will be smoother. Hindi ako makulit coz I don't want to sound annoying. 
And nagpapadala ako ng gifts hindi Para magpasikat kungdi Para magparamdam.. Na parang ""Life is happier to share it with somone.. Let's try""  and I am hoping na Sana, Cia na Yung last ko, after my almost 2 decades of relationship breakup. Hindi tlga ako sanay magisa.

Ps. I am not an introvert, I am actually an extrovert, so I heard introvert Cia, Kaya nagreresearch din ako ng better approach to her na hindi Cia maooverwhelm. 

When we first met, siya nagsabi ng perfume na gusto niya. And she was also the one who says I need to give it to her in person. So I went there in person. (my friend told me... She looked kinikilig and happy) so tuloy ko Lang. 

Ako Lang din, coz I don't really pursue people this long... I don't like going there kase it's a professional workplace for her and ayaw ko naman lumandi Doon 😂

Hence Kaya ko pinapadala mga gifts ko. I'm planning to do this till March, if wala tlga it's OK. 
But Feb 12 I will voice out my intention na so I will have a better understanding if we are in the same page or if we have the same spark. 

Cguro, any ideas.. Any reaction - - - Maa appreciate ko. Thanks in advance guys",1,1738128671.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

Toddler is nearly 4 years old, nursed and coslept successfully. No impact on this situation. Baby is 13 months old. Same deal, nursing and cosleeping. Baby has been a good sleeper, something changed two months ago. I should say baby has been a good sleeper for 10 months. We always nurse to sleep. No routines have changed. No milk supply issues. She just keeps waking up every hour sort of upset. I can settle her down by either patting, rocking, nursing. So she is not difficult. I just don’t understand why she wakes up every hour or every  two hours. This is why I did the cosleeping thing. It was such a raging success with baby one and baby two. The babies wake up every 3 or 4 hours to nurse. Which I find totally manageable. I just don’t understand what happened now for the last two months that baby can’t connect sleep cycles or something. She also used to like a pacifier for naps and nighttime but not anymore. We would nurse, settle down, unlatch with pacifier if needed. But now, she nurses then unlatches by herself without a pacifier but this means I’m unable to unlatch her sometimes because she won’t accept the pacifier. You may ask why unlatch her? Well so I can go back to sleep. If she’s waking up every hour, she can’t stay latched forever. The pacifier helped me in the past to ease and expedite the unlatching process. Based on her demeanour, she’s not waking up to eat. She’s not hungry. Soemthing is bothering her. She is not anemic. I give her supplements and vitamin D. I give her Tylenol here and there for teething and some teething remedies. I’m very very consistent. I don’t drink coffee past 3pm. The naps for baby are great. She naps alone. Naps are always in the same bed. If her nap is cut short, I’ll settle her down with nursing and she goes back to sleep. I tried to do the same nap thing at night. Let her sleep alone and I stay stand by but she still wakes up every hour. Could it be acid reflex? Maybe we need famotidine. I have not noticed a connection between Tylenol and better sleep. Give me some ideas.

I have good experience and great references.

In the last 10 months I’ve applied for over 100 roles at a massive range of places, starting off with jobs that are perfectly within my ability. I never got past seek/linkedin. After that I started applying for jobs that are below my ability – entry level marketing jobs at places I wouldn’t mind working. In the last 10 months I’ve had one interview for which I was referred internally by a friend. I was over qualified.

So here I am, applying for jobs I can do in my sleep at places I’ve never heard of, never hearing back.

 The issue I’m having is that I have no idea where I’m going wrong. My CV is professional and clear. I rework it for each application, and I run it through various platforms to ensure that it shouldn’t be rejected by ATS scanners. Same story for my cover letter.

The recruiters I’ve spoken to have told me my CV and cover letter are great, and that they’ll let me know if something comes along that I’d be good for (still waiting lol).

So the question is – what’s the play here? I can easily spend a full day on an application, but is it even worth it? Am I better off going for volume over quality? Should I walk around the city handing my CV out? Is cold calling still a thing?

It would be great if someone in HR can tell me how the system works - what is it that gets one application through over the countless others?

On the bright side, I barely even register the rejections anymore. So that’s something. 🥲",1,1738127980.0,jobhunting,0,1.0,False
1icmkrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1icmkrz/the_midnight_ferry_part_4/,The Midnight Ferry (Part 4),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i3sad1/the_midnight_ferry_part_1/) | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i4ty09/the_midnight_ferry_part_2/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i78182/the_midnight_ferry_part_3/)

Do you fear the water? I do. Of all the phobias which exist, I imagine this one is among the most common a lot of us share. I invite you to imagine just how it felt for me in that moment. Picture yourself in a deep, yet relatively safe body of water. Maybe a diving pool. You look down to see your legs dangling above the bottom of the pool, 16 feet down. Not scared yet? Okay… now imagine the complex is empty, it’s night time. You watch as the lights are all switched off one by one, and suddenly you are alone. All you can hear is the gentle swish of the water, and perhaps now there are subtle thoughts nagging at the back of your mind. Is the bottom still there? Which way is out? What’s underneath me?

Now, take away the swimming complex, you’re not there anymore. No, now you’re floating in a lake. It’s not huge, you can see the shoreline, and it’s only around 20 feet deep. You know this lake well, you swim here often. Yet still, it is night time, there is no one else around you, and while the human part of your brain knows that there are no dangers in this lake, those primal fears that still dwell deep within your DNA makeup don’t know that. What was that splash of water behind you? A small wave? Or something moving? But no… you know this lake. You know that you are safe.

Now imagine you have no such comforts. You are kilometres off shore, floating in the rough seas of the South Pacific. There is over 13 thousand feet of dark waters underneath you, it is the middle of the night, and you know without a shred of doubt that there are things swimming around underneath you. It is impossible to accurately describe the fear that one feels in that situation. So like I said, I invite you to attempt to imagine it.

For the first few minutes on end I was practically hyperventilating. Waves were rising up, smacking me across the face, and I was struggling to tread water and keep myself afloat, such was my state of panic. I remember the pain in my neck as I snapped my head around every which way, frantically looking for any sign of hope, only to see an endless dark horizon in every direction. I recall the moment I managed to somewhat calm my panicked mind, the dizziness subsiding, and my breath returning to something that resembled normal. That, of course, was the moment the true fear set in. That fight or flight mode tends to keep you distracted enough that you don’t need to focus on the reality of the terrible situation you are in. It was when I calmed a little, began breathing steadily and treading water naturally, that it all hit me at once.

I felt so small. Quite literally, a drop in the ocean. I tried so hard to stay focussed, but all I could think about as I flailed there in the ocean was how quick and easy it would be for a great white shark to swim by and sink its teeth into my abdomen. I wouldn’t even know it was coming. It was so dark, and the sounds of the wind and the waves would drown anything out. I would just be floating there whole one minute, then I would be a bleeding corpse the next. I thought about how pointless a death that would be. It’s strange, but these are the things you think about when you are facing such a reality. Sharks don’t even like the taste of humans. I wouldn’t even be a satisfying meal for a hungry predator. I would just waste away out there, slowly disintegrating for nothing.

And then it happened. Shocking me out of my morbid thoughts, as though only to confirm them, a slight tickle on the bottom of my foot. I snapped backwards quickly, though I did not look down. I continued treading water, hoping, praying that whatever had just touched me had been a stray piece of seaweed or something harmless like that. I imagined my legs dangling down there. I imagined a mouth opening up as a tiger shark raced up from the depths, ready to close its jaws around my feet. I shook my head, trying to shake those awful thoughts from my mind… And there it was again. But not just a tickle this time, no, I felt something grasp around my ankle. I pushed myself backward again, and took a few backstrokes away from where I was. What the hell was that?! Something had just grabbed me! No shark can do that.

I was quickly returning now to my panicked state, my primal brain screaming at me to get out of the water, but of course that not being an option. I told myself I had to keep calm, and did so the best I could. I forced myself to breathe to a rhythm, and I forced myself to keep treading water slowly, to not thrash about, to conserve energy. Yet, every few minutes or so, I would feel it again. That feeling of something slippery and slimy poking, grabbing and prodding at my feet and legs. For those arduous hours that I was out there in the blackness of the ocean, this thing’s behaviour continued. Every so often I would just start swimming. I don’t know how far I got, the tide was strong and I could feel currents pulling me back the way I came. But, no matter how far I thought I swam, this thing pursued me. At one point, I felt the distinct sensation of some kind of tentacle wrapping around my thigh. I could feel it squeezing tighter, almost to the point that I could not kick that leg any further, and I almost resigned myself to drowning in that moment. I don’t know what it was, and I still don’t know why it let go. But that would be the last I felt of it.

Minutes later, after what I can only estimate was around 3 hours stranded in the middle of the ocean alone, I heard a sound that I never imagined could bring me such comfort.

***Bwooom! Bwooom!***

I looked around, and there it was, its bright spotlight shining straight on me. I was not ignorant to the fact that I was about to be going from the fire back into the frying pan, I was just grateful I was going to be out of the former. The ferry’s engined slowed to a crawl, as it began spinning around, turning to face the Portside of the ship toward me. On deck stood two pale figures. I must impress, these figures, while humanoid, were clearly not human beings. For one thing, they were naked, yet featureless. Their faces blank slates. I mean, they did have faces, they were just devoid of any emotion or intent. I did wonder for a moment what these things’ intentions were, did they mean me harm? Were they here to finish me off? Were they here to simply taunt me as I continued flailing helplessly in the water until I inevitably drowned?

Thankfully, none of these theories were true, as a second later I watched them hurl a life ring out to me. The way they moved was bizarre. Every motion was in parallel unison with each other. Both arms swung out like a perfect mirror image as they threw the floatation device out to me. Then, after I grabbed on, they once again, in perfect unison, began reeling me in. When I reached the side of the ferry, they continued their bizarre synchronised routine, reaching down and tossing over a rope ladder, which I proceeded to climb up, dragging myself onto the deck of the ferry. Exhausted, I lay there for a few moments, thankful to be out of the water, yet painfully aware I had only prolonged the misery of my foreseeable destiny. After a minute or so laying there and catching my breath, I rolled over, reached out for the railing and pulled myself back up to my feet. I stood up to face these… things. They stared at me, still standing side by side, a side by side reflection of eachother almost perfectly. The difference now, is that one did indeed have an expression on its face, and not a pleasant one. It stared at me with a scowl on its face. I didn’t feel like I was in any immediate danger from these things though. More than anything, he looked pissed off. I was just about to open my mouth and thank them, when out of nowhere, he slapped me!

Seriously! I shit you not. This… thing, without a single change in expression, with zero hesitation, lifted its hand and slapped me across the face! I could only stare at this asshole, a look of absolute bewilderment on my face, as they both turned and walked away. Once again, they moved in perfect synch with one another. I watched them round the corner out to the rear deck, and that was the last I ever saw of them. Jesus… just when I thought this ferry could get no weirder! I lifted a hand to my face, rubbing it slightly. My God that hurt!

I wouldn’t have too long to dwell on it though, as in that moment my eyes were drawn to an almighty crash from the ocean behind me. Water from whatever had been responsible for this disturbance splashed all over me, drenching the deck. I staggered back a little, as the ferry itself creaked and groaned as it swung to one side, before crashing back down again. I rubbed the salty water from my eyes, my vision blurry, as I heard the ferry’s engines roaring back to life. We began to pick up pace now, as I stumbled my way over to the railing, leaning over and glancing out into the ocean. There was no mistaking it this time, there was something massive beneath those waves. It moved with purpose, its form swaggering from side to side as it drifted through the water. Whatever it was, it did not seem capable of immense speed. It quickly fell behind the more the ferry picked up pace, powering away into the night.

I thought of a couple of things in that moment. My first thoughts, of course, being the hours I had spent floating in those waters, with that thing poking and prodding at me. Had it been this giant which was taunting me all that time? And if so, why did it not pull me down into the depths with it? The second thought that crossed my mind were the ferry’s seemingly random trips out to sea. Could it be the case that whatever this thing was, was hunting us? Were these back and forths out into deeper waters not random at all, and simply the Captain trying to stay one step ahead of this monster? I did not know. All I knew in that moment was that I was glad I was not down there with it. Taking one last glance out to sea and noting the sun just beginning to peak its head over the distant horizon, I slid open the door to the cabin and stepped on back inside. It didn’t take long then for the physical exhaustion to catch up with me. Adrenaline had worn off, my fight or flight response could keep my physical limitations from giving out no longer. My legs turned to jelly, and I collapsed right there where I stood…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke a few hours later to a gentle hand shaking me. Honestly, I was tempted to just ignore whatever the hell it was and continue sleeping, perhaps forever, such was the stink of death on me at this point.

*“Sir… it’s almost closing time!”*

Café Guy’s voice was both a soothing presence and a harrowing reminder that I had once again awoken to yet another day of this nautical nightmare. I slowly sat up, stretching a little and rubbing my eyes before letting out a monstrous yawn. I noticed the ferry was idle once again, and I wondered where we might be. I was about to speak up in response when I was cut off by the obnoxiously loud P.A. system.

*“Attention passengers! We will be making our departure momentarily. The café service will close soon. A reminder to all, please remain inside the vessel and seated. If you need to stretch your legs or get some fresh air, please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Right… that was clearly directed at me, I thought. Apparently I had broken yet another weird rule. What the hell was I meant to do? There was a giant freaking cargo ship about to smash into us! Was I supposed to just stand there and die? Then again, that clearly had been some kind of hallucination. Or was it? I quite literally felt it roar past above me when I was down there…

*“Sir… I must insist that we move things along.”*

I glanced up, realising Café Guy was holding out a hand to me. I grabbed hold and he helped me up off the floor. My clothes were still all damp, and I stunk like a wet dog.

*“Ah… thanks mate.”* I said, as I struggled to find my footing, my body still very weak.

“Come on… let’s fix you something to eat,” Café Guy spoke warmly, smiling that trademark smile. He really did have something of a calming effect among all this madness. I followed him over to the café counter, and without even asking, he began cooking up a variety of different pastries, fresh sandwiches and salads. I didn’t care what he was making for me, I was ravenous enough to eat absolutely anything by this stage. My energy levels were near on non-existent, so my legs could attest to as I fell backwards into a row of seats. Café Guy noticed this, glancing over at me with a sombre look of concern on his face. Before long, he finished up what he was doing and packed all his creations into a bag for me, bringing it over along with a steaming hot cup of coffee. I was grateful for his presence on this otherwise awful ferry. It was nice to know I had a friend, despite everything else.

*“Here you are Sir,”* he said, handing me the food and the coffee. I didn’t even wait, grabbing out one of the beef and potato pies and taking a voracious chomp into its hearty goodness. I realised part way through my shameless display that Café Guy was staring at me. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, no, for the first time he actually looked like he was trying to hold back laughter.

*“Oh my God… I’m sorry! Geez… thanks mate. I appreciate it! It’s um… it’s really good!”* I stammered out, laughing a little myself as I did so and taking a sip of my coffee in an attempt to bridge myself back into a state of civility. Café Guy chuckled softly and shook his head a little, but after a moment that spark of happiness left his face. He suddenly looked sombre again, and he just stared for a moment before speaking up again.

*“You need to be more careful young man. You’re lucky we found you all the way out there! I’m sure you know this by now, but there are more to these waters we sail than meets the eye.”*

Finishing up my mouthful of pie, I nodded my head in response. *“Yeah… I sure do. I saw something down there early this morning, after they pulled me out of the water. It was huge. I’m pretty sure whatever it was had been trying to grab me when I was in the ocean too…”* I said, turning to face him now.

Café Guy slowly shook his head, before looking me in the eyes as he spoke again. *“If one of those wanted to take you, you’d be gone.”*

I froze upon hearing those words. So many things running through my brain all at once. There was more than one? What were they? What was their purpose? And… “*if* it wanted to take me”…? Is that the only reason I’m still breathing? Because this thing was in a good mood? The weight I felt in that moment was crushing, thinking back to my helpless self floating in that water. I shuddered at the thought of it.

Café Guy noticed this, and placed a hand gently on my shoulder. He spoke once more in that calming tone of his. *“Don’t you dwell on it sir. Things have a way of working out in the end,”* he said, before taking a glance down at his watch. He stood up, walking back over to the café and crouching down. He pulled out his set of keys and opened up a small locker beneath the counter. He pulled out a neatly packed bag, before locking back up, standing up and walking back over to me.

*“I have a feeling you need these more than me,”* he said, looking down at my still damp clothes. *“They’re clean and freshly washed, they should fit you. No need to give them back. I shan’t be needing them.”*

I glanced back at him, smiling a little myself now. *“Thanks mate… I appreciate you. I mean, I still don’t know what your deal is here, but you’ve been kind to me, and if by some miracle I make it back to the real world, I won’t forget it,”* I said to him, before reaching out my hand to shake his. He accepted my gesture, firmly shaking my hand, before turning and walking away.

So there I was again. Just me and the ferry, and the ever increasing number of strange passengers boarding it. I had given up hope of trying to get off this thing. If what I experienced in the sea was any indication of what the world outside had become, it seemed that I was safer in here than I was out there. For now though, I just wanted to get comfortable. Placing my bag of food down on my row of seats, I took the clothes Café Guy had given me and made my way downstairs to the bathroom to get changed. As I stepped down off the final step, I scanned the lower level of the ferry, noticing that both sides had now almost filled up. There must have been some more… “stops”, in the time that I was floating out there. Looking around the crowd, I noticed that some of the passengers we were picking up were looking less and less human. In the beginning, when I first noticed this shift in appearance, it was just subtleties. Like I said, the kind of human-LIKE appearance you get from an AI image generator. But now, this was even more pronounced. Some of the figures seated in the back right hand rows had these thick, rubbery looking heads sporting blank, almost faceless expressions as they turned their gaze toward me. Others were very unnaturally tall and thin, looking like they had been placed between two giant vice clamps and forcibly stretched out. Then some among the crowd had almost no human appearance what so ever, humanoid in shape being as close as they got. Many of them looked to have been pulled straight from the sea just as I was, their bodies covered in seaweed with clams and barnacles still hanging off soggy flaps of skin.

I quickly looked away from these humanoid “nothing-people”, as I had come to refer to them, as I noticed almost all of them were staring at me now. They were making me feel uneasy, and I didn’t like it. The fact that they just sat there and stared was in some ways worse than if they had been doing anything outright malicious. I slipped my way past the back row of seats, shivering as my arm brushed against the scraggly mess of dank, wet hair belonging to one of the passengers. I quickened my pace, rounding the corner and shutting myself inside the bathroom to change. Opening up the bag, I found a set of blue jeans and a white polo shirt. Very casual, I thought. Thanks Café Guy! I quickly changed into the dry clothes, stepped out and chucked my now surely ruined set into the trash. I sighed as I glanced out over the deck. We were back in Sydney Harbour once again, a sight I once cherished every time I laid eyes on it, but now? A landscape of pure dread. There was no one out there now. I don’t mean like the first couple of times where I could at least see shadows of people in the distance. This time there was just… no one.

I woefully turned my gaze away from this depressing landscape and made my way back upstairs to my row of seats. The upper floor was now my one and only safe haven away from the nothing-people. Even the group of convicts that had tried to attack me last night had now made their way down the stairs to join the rest of them, neatly sat in rows, all facing straight ahead, aside from their dopey stares toward me whenever I would show myself around them. It seemed the only time they ever broke from this trance was to herd themselves up the stairs and get their morning meals. Sitting down in my little corner, I grabbed out a sandwich and started munching away as the ferry made its way through the harbour once again. I wasn’t even all that shocked anymore, as I glanced out at the rotting scenery around me. Once again, same as yesterday, the ferry started pulling in to various ports, and again, they looked absolutely nothing like I had once known them to. The Maritime Museum wharf, which proudly houses the HMAS Vampire, now featured only the decaying hull of a ship half sunken in the harbour. As we began to sail out of the harbour and back toward the Parramatta River, I dared not look as we passed by Goat Island, seeing enough merely out of the corners of my vision to deter me from directly looking at whatever horrors were stomping their way across the shores. They were massive, whatever the hell they were, and I shifted away from the window and into one of the centre rows of seats, afraid that they might reach out for me.

Onwards we sailed, up and down the river and around and about the harbour, continuing this now monotonous routine of pulling into random stops, some I didn’t even know existed, and picking up more travellers. I stayed put right where I was, but every time a new group of them would board, my eyes stayed locked on the stairwell ahead of me, silently praying that none of them would make their way up here again. It must have been nearing about 4pm that day when it happened. I was out on deck getting some fresh air, just watching out over the water ahead, when I noticed the ferry was picking up speed. It was moving unusually fast, and this frightened me, but not near as much as what came next. I gripped the rail tight as the ferry began to turn, our heading now directed straight into the bank of the river. I thought this must be a mistake. I was sure that at any moment we would adjust our course back out into open space. But we didn’t, we only picked up speed. We were about 20 metres from the shoreline now, and I was just about to jump off the side again when I remembered the words from earlier…

*“Please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Now mere moments away from smashing into the shoreline, I grabbed the railing as tight as I possibly could, bracing for the oncoming impact… and then suddenly, my grip loosened, as my eyes met the impossible sight ahead of me. With an unearthly groan, the land itself began to morph before my very eyes. Within seconds, a new passage of water had opened up, a mass of twisted mangroves forming a tunnel around it. At speed, we blasted through the opening, as a crash of thunder erupted from the sky, much like when we had entered Botany Bay, and I cringed in terror, once again fearing I may be struck down by lightning.

But all was quiet, and the ferry began to slow its pace now. As I rose back up to my feet, I looked around in astonishment at the surroundings we now found ourselves within. We were trekking through a mangrove ridden swampland, the buzz of mosquitos and the stink off the muddy riverbank thick in the air. I was well travelled, and there was only one place in this country I had witnessed this kind of scenery. A soft clunk against the hull of the ferry, and the swish of a thick, reptilian tail disappearing beneath the water confirmed what I was thinking. We were not in Sydney anymore, we were traversing through a northern mangrove river.

My head began to spin. I’m not sure why, surely I should be used to this madness by now, but somehow this damned ferry managed to up the stakes yet again. I stumbled backward, turning around to go back inside, when I was met with the sight of yet another crocodile. This one, its head slightly elevated out of the water, as they tend to do before they jump, its jaws open slightly. I kept my eyes locked on it, ready to throw myself backward should it make a move, but not wanting to be the one to move first and startle it into striking. The ferry gurgled along through this murky hellscape, as the world around me became progressively weirder. Dark mists were now rising up out of the water, and more creatures began swimming around, circling the vessel. The more I got a good look at them, the more I realised how wrong I had been. They were not crocodiles. Too big. Even the most monstrous of crocs ever seen in Australia capped out at around eight and a half metres. These things circling the boat were at least twice that, looking more like the ancient Sarcosuchus than a modern day crocodilian. I took another couple of steps back, and suddenly, the P.A. system crackled to life again…

*“Attention… for your own safety, remain inside the ferry. Stay away from the water, and do not look outside.”*

They didn’t need to tell me twice. I quickly, yet quietly, made my way back inside and took my seat again, this time, keeping my eyes front. For hours we sailed through this natural maze, until I finally felt the ferry begin to swing in to a stop. Once again, the P.A. system exploded with static…

*“Attention! Remain inside the vessel! Keep your eyes closed! I repeat! KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!”*

Catching sight of the long, twisted jetty winding out from within the dark mangroves ahead, and the barest glimpse of the tall, stretched out nothing-people lined up along it, I did exactly what the P.A. voice instructed. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and did everything I could to turn my focus away from what was outside. A screeching sound rang out as the ferry swung in to dock, followed by the regular clangs out on deck as Ramp Guy hurled the now busted up metal foot bridge out onto the pier for these awful things to board the ship.

I could hear quiet whispers, along with the soft buzz of insects and the lapping of the water against the shoreline. I then heard the tapping of what sounded like sharp, pointed feet, clicking their way across the ramp. And finally, I heard the sound of the ramp being pulled back in and the gates latching shut. The ferry then floated there for a few minutes, as I listened to the new arrivals getting seated downstairs, their whispers now fading away as they no doubt joined the rest of the mindless drones in their ever present state of nothingness. Once I could hear them no more, and was satisfied that they were of no threat to me, I opened my eyes…

*“Please don’t be real,”* I thought, as I immediately shut my eyes once again.

Something… was looking straight at me. Through the window. Right next to my head. The window which was only half closed, leaving no barrier between us. I dared not continue to look, but what I saw was enough. It was clung to the windowsill, its face half pressed against the glass. The rest of its body hung limp across the deck of the ferry, its legs dangling out over the side. I pressed my eyes shut as tightly as I could, as I felt its breath on my neck, and heard it whispering between breaths.

*“Can you help me?”* It said, between ragged breaths.

I slid myself over to the farthest seat in the row I was in, but even then I could still feel its breath, and I could now feel its hand, sliding up against me, as if it were desperately trying to grab onto me.

*“Please… help me…”* It spoke again.

I once again felt a slimy hand uselessly attempting to grasp at my arm. I was crying silent tears now. I wanted to get up and run, but I did not know what else was around me. Perhaps I would be running straight into another of its kind.

*“Help… me…”* It spoke just one more time, as the ferry began to pull away from the jetty, and I heard it slide off the deck, and plop into the water. Its fate from that point? I do not know. Not once did I open my eyes again as the ferry continued sailing through this otherworldly land. Every so often, I would hear the ferry pick up pace, followed by that familiar crash of thunder again, before slowing down and continuing to make more stops. All the while, I could hear things boarding the vessel. Some would speak in tongues I could not possibly understand. Others spoke in languages I recognised, but did not know. Spanish, Mandarin, a variety of Asian and European languages as well as many others. I would hear the odd American or British accent, and in amongst it all I would also hear terrifying voices. Mixtures of groans, clicks and gurgles. All manner of specimens were being herded onto this ferry. But for what? I had no idea, nor did I really want to know anything about what was happening around me.

It wasn’t until we were back in Sydney Harbour that I opened my eyes again, and how I wish I had not. The ferry picked up pace, roaring through yet another of these portal things, and once we were through, I heard the familiar sounds of the harbour once more, feeling comfortable enough to look outside. First glance was not enough, I had to be certain of what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, shook my head, and looked again.

As the ferry slowly sailed down the harbour, a terrible sight lay before me. Sydney was no more. I mean, it was there, kind of. The beautiful cityscape I had gazed upon so many times, was now an apocalyptic wasteland. The Sydney Tower, once standing proudly high above the city, had been snapped off midway up. The buildings were in ruins. The Sydney Harbour Bridge lay in shambles, broken off in the centre, and each side hanging downward. I watched in horror as hordes of these nothing-people wandered across the decaying bridge from both ends, toppling into the harbour as they reached the tipping point in the centre. The Opera House, once a proud symbol of our beautiful city now lay in pieces, its iconic sails scattered all over.

I turned away from this nightmare, forcing my eyes to look at anything else, but what I saw inside was no better. The ferry was almost full now. Many more nothing-people had entered the vessel during our ventures down that river, and wherever the hell else we had been. All over the world, by the sounds of things. The upper floor was no longer my safe haven away from them, as it too was now almost full, the entire opposite side now filled with figures taking all manner of forms. All of them, staring squarely at me.

I looked away from them, feeling uneasy, yet relatively assured that if the previous days were any indication, once they were boarded and seated, they meant me no harm.

The ferry continued to sail up and down the harbour, and a few more stops and pickups were made, all the while I tried my best to relax, to sit back and not draw any attention to myself. And I managed to do just that. Even as my own side of the ferry began to fill up with boarding travellers, I somehow managed to keep my head. That was until the end of the day.

It was around 7pm that night, when the ferry went down. No… I don’t mean it powered down for the night. I mean it dropped ***straight down!***

Any composure I had managed to maintain went out the window, as I tucked myself down in my seat, preparing for the rush of cold water to pour in through the open doors and windows, trapping us all in this underwater coffin. But… they didn’t.

I was instead suddenly surrounded by utter silence, save for a dull wind, audible, yet I could feel nothing on my skin through the windows. I slowly raised my head and opened my eyes, noticing the pitched black night sky outside. Had I imagined what just happened? I could have sworn to God this ferry had just dropped straight down underneath the water. I saw it. I felt it happen! But alas, there was the night sky, right there. I could not hear the typical sounds of the harbour anymore, and I wondered if we were even still in Sydney.

I got up from my seat, intending to take a look outside at what was going on. Slowly I slid open the door to the Starboard side deck, and I very carefully stepped out, painfully aware of the many hidden threats that may lie waiting out there. What met my eyes this time, however, was so much worse than anything I had yet seen on this journey.

As I gazed over the side of that ferry, seeing no water at all beneath us, and observing the green and blue ball suspended in vast, black nothingness, slowly disappearing into the darkness we were now floating off into, I realised with a dizzying horror… Not only were we not in Sydney Harbour anymore… we were not even on ***Earth*** anymore…",2,1738127948.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

While we were there, he pointed out how sharply dressed every older black man he saw on the two Sunday mornings we were there and mentioned how incredible he thought their crocodile skin loafers were, and he seemed excited with how common they seemed to be because it meant he could probably find a pair (the man loves a good pair of loafers). Alas, we couldn't find a store that specialized in them, and he seemed to really want a more uncommon color, not just a neutral, unless that neutral was white or a coffee color with gold trappings. He mentioned the shoes again tonight apropos of nothing, and my Google skills have failed me for the first time I can remember. So: is there a retailer with an online presence I could purchase these from for him? Black-owned businesses preferred ofc, considering these seem to be an overwhelmingly Black ""Sunday best"" fashion choice.

Do you fear the water? I do. Of all the phobias which exist, I imagine this one is among the most common a lot of us share. I invite you to imagine just how it felt for me in that moment. Picture yourself in a deep, yet relatively safe body of water. Maybe a diving pool. You look down to see your legs dangling above the bottom of the pool, 16 feet down. Not scared yet? Okay… now imagine the complex is empty, it’s night time. You watch as the lights are all switched off one by one, and suddenly you are alone. All you can hear is the gentle swish of the water, and perhaps now there are subtle thoughts nagging at the back of your mind. Is the bottom still there? Which way is out? What’s underneath me?

Now, take away the swimming complex, you’re not there anymore. No, now you’re floating in a lake. It’s not huge, you can see the shoreline, and it’s only around 20 feet deep. You know this lake well, you swim here often. Yet still, it is night time, there is no one else around you, and while the human part of your brain knows that there are no dangers in this lake, those primal fears that still dwell deep within your DNA makeup don’t know that. What was that splash of water behind you? A small wave? Or something moving? But no… you know this lake. You know that you are safe.

Now imagine you have no such comforts. You are kilometres off shore, floating in the rough seas of the South Pacific. There is over 13 thousand feet of dark waters underneath you, it is the middle of the night, and you know without a shred of doubt that there are things swimming around underneath you. It is impossible to accurately describe the fear that one feels in that situation. So like I said, I invite you to attempt to imagine it.

For the first few minutes on end I was practically hyperventilating. Waves were rising up, smacking me across the face, and I was struggling to tread water and keep myself afloat, such was my state of panic. I remember the pain in my neck as I snapped my head around every which way, frantically looking for any sign of hope, only to see an endless dark horizon in every direction. I recall the moment I managed to somewhat calm my panicked mind, the dizziness subsiding, and my breath returning to something that resembled normal. That, of course, was the moment the true fear set in. That fight or flight mode tends to keep you distracted enough that you don’t need to focus on the reality of the terrible situation you are in. It was when I calmed a little, began breathing steadily and treading water naturally, that it all hit me at once.

I felt so small. Quite literally, a drop in the ocean. I tried so hard to stay focussed, but all I could think about as I flailed there in the ocean was how quick and easy it would be for a great white shark to swim by and sink its teeth into my abdomen. I wouldn’t even know it was coming. It was so dark, and the sounds of the wind and the waves would drown anything out. I would just be floating there whole one minute, then I would be a bleeding corpse the next. I thought about how pointless a death that would be. It’s strange, but these are the things you think about when you are facing such a reality. Sharks don’t even like the taste of humans. I wouldn’t even be a satisfying meal for a hungry predator. I would just waste away out there, slowly disintegrating for nothing.

And then it happened. Shocking me out of my morbid thoughts, as though only to confirm them, a slight tickle on the bottom of my foot. I snapped backwards quickly, though I did not look down. I continued treading water, hoping, praying that whatever had just touched me had been a stray piece of seaweed or something harmless like that. I imagined my legs dangling down there. I imagined a mouth opening up as a tiger shark raced up from the depths, ready to close its jaws around my feet. I shook my head, trying to shake those awful thoughts from my mind… And there it was again. But not just a tickle this time, no, I felt something grasp around my ankle. I pushed myself backward again, and took a few backstrokes away from where I was. What the hell was that?! Something had just grabbed me! No shark can do that.

I was quickly returning now to my panicked state, my primal brain screaming at me to get out of the water, but of course that not being an option. I told myself I had to keep calm, and did so the best I could. I forced myself to breathe to a rhythm, and I forced myself to keep treading water slowly, to not thrash about, to conserve energy. Yet, every few minutes or so, I would feel it again. That feeling of something slippery and slimy poking, grabbing and prodding at my feet and legs. For those arduous hours that I was out there in the blackness of the ocean, this thing’s behaviour continued. Every so often I would just start swimming. I don’t know how far I got, the tide was strong and I could feel currents pulling me back the way I came. But, no matter how far I thought I swam, this thing pursued me. At one point, I felt the distinct sensation of some kind of tentacle wrapping around my thigh. I could feel it squeezing tighter, almost to the point that I could not kick that leg any further, and I almost resigned myself to drowning in that moment. I don’t know what it was, and I still don’t know why it let go. But that would be the last I felt of it.

Minutes later, after what I can only estimate was around 3 hours stranded in the middle of the ocean alone, I heard a sound that I never imagined could bring me such comfort.

***Bwooom! Bwooom!***

I looked around, and there it was, its bright spotlight shining straight on me. I was not ignorant to the fact that I was about to be going from the fire back into the frying pan, I was just grateful I was going to be out of the former. The ferry’s engined slowed to a crawl, as it began spinning around, turning to face the Portside of the ship toward me. On deck stood two pale figures. I must impress, these figures, while humanoid, were clearly not human beings. For one thing, they were naked, yet featureless. Their faces blank slates. I mean, they did have faces, they were just devoid of any emotion or intent. I did wonder for a moment what these things’ intentions were, did they mean me harm? Were they here to finish me off? Were they here to simply taunt me as I continued flailing helplessly in the water until I inevitably drowned?

Thankfully, none of these theories were true, as a second later I watched them hurl a life ring out to me. The way they moved was bizarre. Every motion was in parallel unison with each other. Both arms swung out like a perfect mirror image as they threw the floatation device out to me. Then, after I grabbed on, they once again, in perfect unison, began reeling me in. When I reached the side of the ferry, they continued their bizarre synchronised routine, reaching down and tossing over a rope ladder, which I proceeded to climb up, dragging myself onto the deck of the ferry. Exhausted, I lay there for a few moments, thankful to be out of the water, yet painfully aware I had only prolonged the misery of my foreseeable destiny. After a minute or so laying there and catching my breath, I rolled over, reached out for the railing and pulled myself back up to my feet. I stood up to face these… things. They stared at me, still standing side by side, a side by side reflection of eachother almost perfectly. The difference now, is that one did indeed have an expression on its face, and not a pleasant one. It stared at me with a scowl on its face. I didn’t feel like I was in any immediate danger from these things though. More than anything, he looked pissed off. I was just about to open my mouth and thank them, when out of nowhere, he slapped me!

Seriously! I shit you not. This… thing, without a single change in expression, with zero hesitation, lifted its hand and slapped me across the face! I could only stare at this asshole, a look of absolute bewilderment on my face, as they both turned and walked away. Once again, they moved in perfect synch with one another. I watched them round the corner out to the rear deck, and that was the last I ever saw of them. Jesus… just when I thought this ferry could get no weirder! I lifted a hand to my face, rubbing it slightly. My God that hurt!

I wouldn’t have too long to dwell on it though, as in that moment my eyes were drawn to an almighty crash from the ocean behind me. Water from whatever had been responsible for this disturbance splashed all over me, drenching the deck. I staggered back a little, as the ferry itself creaked and groaned as it swung to one side, before crashing back down again. I rubbed the salty water from my eyes, my vision blurry, as I heard the ferry’s engines roaring back to life. We began to pick up pace now, as I stumbled my way over to the railing, leaning over and glancing out into the ocean. There was no mistaking it this time, there was something massive beneath those waves. It moved with purpose, its form swaggering from side to side as it drifted through the water. Whatever it was, it did not seem capable of immense speed. It quickly fell behind the more the ferry picked up pace, powering away into the night.

I thought of a couple of things in that moment. My first thoughts, of course, being the hours I had spent floating in those waters, with that thing poking and prodding at me. Had it been this giant which was taunting me all that time? And if so, why did it not pull me down into the depths with it? The second thought that crossed my mind were the ferry’s seemingly random trips out to sea. Could it be the case that whatever this thing was, was hunting us? Were these back and forths out into deeper waters not random at all, and simply the Captain trying to stay one step ahead of this monster? I did not know. All I knew in that moment was that I was glad I was not down there with it. Taking one last glance out to sea and noting the sun just beginning to peak its head over the distant horizon, I slid open the door to the cabin and stepped on back inside. It didn’t take long then for the physical exhaustion to catch up with me. Adrenaline had worn off, my fight or flight response could keep my physical limitations from giving out no longer. My legs turned to jelly, and I collapsed right there where I stood…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke a few hours later to a gentle hand shaking me. Honestly, I was tempted to just ignore whatever the hell it was and continue sleeping, perhaps forever, such was the stink of death on me at this point.

*“Sir… it’s almost closing time!”*

Café Guy’s voice was both a soothing presence and a harrowing reminder that I had once again awoken to yet another day of this nautical nightmare. I slowly sat up, stretching a little and rubbing my eyes before letting out a monstrous yawn. I noticed the ferry was idle once again, and I wondered where we might be. I was about to speak up in response when I was cut off by the obnoxiously loud P.A. system.

*“Attention passengers! We will be making our departure momentarily. The café service will close soon. A reminder to all, please remain inside the vessel and seated. If you need to stretch your legs or get some fresh air, please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Right… that was clearly directed at me, I thought. Apparently I had broken yet another weird rule. What the hell was I meant to do? There was a giant freaking cargo ship about to smash into us! Was I supposed to just stand there and die? Then again, that clearly had been some kind of hallucination. Or was it? I quite literally felt it roar past above me when I was down there…

*“Sir… I must insist that we move things along.”*

I glanced up, realising Café Guy was holding out a hand to me. I grabbed hold and he helped me up off the floor. My clothes were still all damp, and I stunk like a wet dog.

*“Ah… thanks mate.”* I said, as I struggled to find my footing, my body still very weak.

“Come on… let’s fix you something to eat,” Café Guy spoke warmly, smiling that trademark smile. He really did have something of a calming effect among all this madness. I followed him over to the café counter, and without even asking, he began cooking up a variety of different pastries, fresh sandwiches and salads. I didn’t care what he was making for me, I was ravenous enough to eat absolutely anything by this stage. My energy levels were near on non-existent, so my legs could attest to as I fell backwards into a row of seats. Café Guy noticed this, glancing over at me with a sombre look of concern on his face. Before long, he finished up what he was doing and packed all his creations into a bag for me, bringing it over along with a steaming hot cup of coffee. I was grateful for his presence on this otherwise awful ferry. It was nice to know I had a friend, despite everything else.

*“Here you are Sir,”* he said, handing me the food and the coffee. I didn’t even wait, grabbing out one of the beef and potato pies and taking a voracious chomp into its hearty goodness. I realised part way through my shameless display that Café Guy was staring at me. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, no, for the first time he actually looked like he was trying to hold back laughter.

*“Oh my God… I’m sorry! Geez… thanks mate. I appreciate it! It’s um… it’s really good!”* I stammered out, laughing a little myself as I did so and taking a sip of my coffee in an attempt to bridge myself back into a state of civility. Café Guy chuckled softly and shook his head a little, but after a moment that spark of happiness left his face. He suddenly looked sombre again, and he just stared for a moment before speaking up again.

*“You need to be more careful young man. You’re lucky we found you all the way out there! I’m sure you know this by now, but there are more to these waters we sail than meets the eye.”*

Finishing up my mouthful of pie, I nodded my head in response. *“Yeah… I sure do. I saw something down there early this morning, after they pulled me out of the water. It was huge. I’m pretty sure whatever it was had been trying to grab me when I was in the ocean too…”* I said, turning to face him now.

Café Guy slowly shook his head, before looking me in the eyes as he spoke again. *“If one of those wanted to take you, you’d be gone.”*

I froze upon hearing those words. So many things running through my brain all at once. There was more than one? What were they? What was their purpose? And… “*if* it wanted to take me”…? Is that the only reason I’m still breathing? Because this thing was in a good mood? The weight I felt in that moment was crushing, thinking back to my helpless self floating in that water. I shuddered at the thought of it.

Café Guy noticed this, and placed a hand gently on my shoulder. He spoke once more in that calming tone of his. *“Don’t you dwell on it sir. Things have a way of working out in the end,”* he said, before taking a glance down at his watch. He stood up, walking back over to the café and crouching down. He pulled out his set of keys and opened up a small locker beneath the counter. He pulled out a neatly packed bag, before locking back up, standing up and walking back over to me.

*“I have a feeling you need these more than me,”* he said, looking down at my still damp clothes. *“They’re clean and freshly washed, they should fit you. No need to give them back. I shan’t be needing them.”*

I glanced back at him, smiling a little myself now. *“Thanks mate… I appreciate you. I mean, I still don’t know what your deal is here, but you’ve been kind to me, and if by some miracle I make it back to the real world, I won’t forget it,”* I said to him, before reaching out my hand to shake his. He accepted my gesture, firmly shaking my hand, before turning and walking away.

So there I was again. Just me and the ferry, and the ever increasing number of strange passengers boarding it. I had given up hope of trying to get off this thing. If what I experienced in the sea was any indication of what the world outside had become, it seemed that I was safer in here than I was out there. For now though, I just wanted to get comfortable. Placing my bag of food down on my row of seats, I took the clothes Café Guy had given me and made my way downstairs to the bathroom to get changed. As I stepped down off the final step, I scanned the lower level of the ferry, noticing that both sides had now almost filled up. There must have been some more… “stops”, in the time that I was floating out there. Looking around the crowd, I noticed that some of the passengers we were picking up were looking less and less human. In the beginning, when I first noticed this shift in appearance, it was just subtleties. Like I said, the kind of human-LIKE appearance you get from an AI image generator. But now, this was even more pronounced. Some of the figures seated in the back right hand rows had these thick, rubbery looking heads sporting blank, almost faceless expressions as they turned their gaze toward me. Others were very unnaturally tall and thin, looking like they had been placed between two giant vice clamps and forcibly stretched out. Then some among the crowd had almost no human appearance what so ever, humanoid in shape being as close as they got. Many of them looked to have been pulled straight from the sea just as I was, their bodies covered in seaweed with clams and barnacles still hanging off soggy flaps of skin.

I quickly looked away from these humanoid “nothing-people”, as I had come to refer to them, as I noticed almost all of them were staring at me now. They were making me feel uneasy, and I didn’t like it. The fact that they just sat there and stared was in some ways worse than if they had been doing anything outright malicious. I slipped my way past the back row of seats, shivering as my arm brushed against the scraggly mess of dank, wet hair belonging to one of the passengers. I quickened my pace, rounding the corner and shutting myself inside the bathroom to change. Opening up the bag, I found a set of blue jeans and a white polo shirt. Very casual, I thought. Thanks Café Guy! I quickly changed into the dry clothes, stepped out and chucked my now surely ruined set into the trash. I sighed as I glanced out over the deck. We were back in Sydney Harbour once again, a sight I once cherished every time I laid eyes on it, but now? A landscape of pure dread. There was no one out there now. I don’t mean like the first couple of times where I could at least see shadows of people in the distance. This time there was just… no one.

I woefully turned my gaze away from this depressing landscape and made my way back upstairs to my row of seats. The upper floor was now my one and only safe haven away from the nothing-people. Even the group of convicts that had tried to attack me last night had now made their way down the stairs to join the rest of them, neatly sat in rows, all facing straight ahead, aside from their dopey stares toward me whenever I would show myself around them. It seemed the only time they ever broke from this trance was to herd themselves up the stairs and get their morning meals. Sitting down in my little corner, I grabbed out a sandwich and started munching away as the ferry made its way through the harbour once again. I wasn’t even all that shocked anymore, as I glanced out at the rotting scenery around me. Once again, same as yesterday, the ferry started pulling in to various ports, and again, they looked absolutely nothing like I had once known them to. The Maritime Museum wharf, which proudly houses the HMAS Vampire, now featured only the decaying hull of a ship half sunken in the harbour. As we began to sail out of the harbour and back toward the Parramatta River, I dared not look as we passed by Goat Island, seeing enough merely out of the corners of my vision to deter me from directly looking at whatever horrors were stomping their way across the shores. They were massive, whatever the hell they were, and I shifted away from the window and into one of the centre rows of seats, afraid that they might reach out for me.

Onwards we sailed, up and down the river and around and about the harbour, continuing this now monotonous routine of pulling into random stops, some I didn’t even know existed, and picking up more travellers. I stayed put right where I was, but every time a new group of them would board, my eyes stayed locked on the stairwell ahead of me, silently praying that none of them would make their way up here again. It must have been nearing about 4pm that day when it happened. I was out on deck getting some fresh air, just watching out over the water ahead, when I noticed the ferry was picking up speed. It was moving unusually fast, and this frightened me, but not near as much as what came next. I gripped the rail tight as the ferry began to turn, our heading now directed straight into the bank of the river. I thought this must be a mistake. I was sure that at any moment we would adjust our course back out into open space. But we didn’t, we only picked up speed. We were about 20 metres from the shoreline now, and I was just about to jump off the side again when I remembered the words from earlier…

*“Please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Now mere moments away from smashing into the shoreline, I grabbed the railing as tight as I possibly could, bracing for the oncoming impact… and then suddenly, my grip loosened, as my eyes met the impossible sight ahead of me. With an unearthly groan, the land itself began to morph before my very eyes. Within seconds, a new passage of water had opened up, a mass of twisted mangroves forming a tunnel around it. At speed, we blasted through the opening, as a crash of thunder erupted from the sky, much like when we had entered Botany Bay, and I cringed in terror, once again fearing I may be struck down by lightning.

But all was quiet, and the ferry began to slow its pace now. As I rose back up to my feet, I looked around in astonishment at the surroundings we now found ourselves within. We were trekking through a mangrove ridden swampland, the buzz of mosquitos and the stink off the muddy riverbank thick in the air. I was well travelled, and there was only one place in this country I had witnessed this kind of scenery. A soft clunk against the hull of the ferry, and the swish of a thick, reptilian tail disappearing beneath the water confirmed what I was thinking. We were not in Sydney anymore, we were traversing through a northern mangrove river.

My head began to spin. I’m not sure why, surely I should be used to this madness by now, but somehow this damned ferry managed to up the stakes yet again. I stumbled backward, turning around to go back inside, when I was met with the sight of yet another crocodile. This one, its head slightly elevated out of the water, as they tend to do before they jump, its jaws open slightly. I kept my eyes locked on it, ready to throw myself backward should it make a move, but not wanting to be the one to move first and startle it into striking. The ferry gurgled along through this murky hellscape, as the world around me became progressively weirder. Dark mists were now rising up out of the water, and more creatures began swimming around, circling the vessel. The more I got a good look at them, the more I realised how wrong I had been. They were not crocodiles. Too big. Even the most monstrous of crocs ever seen in Australia capped out at around eight and a half metres. These things circling the boat were at least twice that, looking more like the ancient Sarcosuchus than a modern day crocodilian. I took another couple of steps back, and suddenly, the P.A. system crackled to life again…

*“Attention… for your own safety, remain inside the ferry. Stay away from the water, and do not look outside.”*

They didn’t need to tell me twice. I quickly, yet quietly, made my way back inside and took my seat again, this time, keeping my eyes front. For hours we sailed through this natural maze, until I finally felt the ferry begin to swing in to a stop. Once again, the P.A. system exploded with static…

*“Attention! Remain inside the vessel! Keep your eyes closed! I repeat! KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!”*

Catching sight of the long, twisted jetty winding out from within the dark mangroves ahead, and the barest glimpse of the tall, stretched out nothing-people lined up along it, I did exactly what the P.A. voice instructed. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and did everything I could to turn my focus away from what was outside. A screeching sound rang out as the ferry swung in to dock, followed by the regular clangs out on deck as Ramp Guy hurled the now busted up metal foot bridge out onto the pier for these awful things to board the ship.

I could hear quiet whispers, along with the soft buzz of insects and the lapping of the water against the shoreline. I then heard the tapping of what sounded like sharp, pointed feet, clicking their way across the ramp. And finally, I heard the sound of the ramp being pulled back in and the gates latching shut. The ferry then floated there for a few minutes, as I listened to the new arrivals getting seated downstairs, their whispers now fading away as they no doubt joined the rest of the mindless drones in their ever present state of nothingness. Once I could hear them no more, and was satisfied that they were of no threat to me, I opened my eyes…

*“Please don’t be real,”* I thought, as I immediately shut my eyes once again.

Something… was looking straight at me. Through the window. Right next to my head. The window which was only half closed, leaving no barrier between us. I dared not continue to look, but what I saw was enough. It was clung to the windowsill, its face half pressed against the glass. The rest of its body hung limp across the deck of the ferry, its legs dangling out over the side. I pressed my eyes shut as tightly as I could, as I felt its breath on my neck, and heard it whispering between breaths.

*“Can you help me?”* It said, between ragged breaths.

I slid myself over to the farthest seat in the row I was in, but even then I could still feel its breath, and I could now feel its hand, sliding up against me, as if it were desperately trying to grab onto me.

*“Please… help me…”* It spoke again.

I once again felt a slimy hand uselessly attempting to grasp at my arm. I was crying silent tears now. I wanted to get up and run, but I did not know what else was around me. Perhaps I would be running straight into another of its kind.

*“Help… me…”* It spoke just one more time, as the ferry began to pull away from the jetty, and I heard it slide off the deck, and plop into the water. Its fate from that point? I do not know. Not once did I open my eyes again as the ferry continued sailing through this otherworldly land. Every so often, I would hear the ferry pick up pace, followed by that familiar crash of thunder again, before slowing down and continuing to make more stops. All the while, I could hear things boarding the vessel. Some would speak in tongues I could not possibly understand. Others spoke in languages I recognised, but did not know. Spanish, Mandarin, a variety of Asian and European languages as well as many others. I would hear the odd American or British accent, and in amongst it all I would also hear terrifying voices. Mixtures of groans, clicks and gurgles. All manner of specimens were being herded onto this ferry. But for what? I had no idea, nor did I really want to know anything about what was happening around me.

It wasn’t until we were back in Sydney Harbour that I opened my eyes again, and how I wish I had not. The ferry picked up pace, roaring through yet another of these portal things, and once we were through, I heard the familiar sounds of the harbour once more, feeling comfortable enough to look outside. First glance was not enough, I had to be certain of what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, shook my head, and looked again.

As the ferry slowly sailed down the harbour, a terrible sight lay before me. Sydney was no more. I mean, it was there, kind of. The beautiful cityscape I had gazed upon so many times, was now an apocalyptic wasteland. The Sydney Tower, once standing proudly high above the city, had been snapped off midway up. The buildings were in ruins. The Sydney Harbour Bridge lay in shambles, broken off in the centre, and each side hanging downward. I watched in horror as hordes of these nothing-people wandered across the decaying bridge from both ends, toppling into the harbour as they reached the tipping point in the centre. The Opera House, once a proud symbol of our beautiful city now lay in pieces, its iconic sails scattered all over.

I turned away from this nightmare, forcing my eyes to look at anything else, but what I saw inside was no better. The ferry was almost full now. Many more nothing-people had entered the vessel during our ventures down that river, and wherever the hell else we had been. All over the world, by the sounds of things. The upper floor was no longer my safe haven away from them, as it too was now almost full, the entire opposite side now filled with figures taking all manner of forms. All of them, staring squarely at me.

I looked away from them, feeling uneasy, yet relatively assured that if the previous days were any indication, once they were boarded and seated, they meant me no harm.

The ferry continued to sail up and down the harbour, and a few more stops and pickups were made, all the while I tried my best to relax, to sit back and not draw any attention to myself. And I managed to do just that. Even as my own side of the ferry began to fill up with boarding travellers, I somehow managed to keep my head. That was until the end of the day.

It was around 7pm that night, when the ferry went down. No… I don’t mean it powered down for the night. I mean it dropped ***straight down!***

Any composure I had managed to maintain went out the window, as I tucked myself down in my seat, preparing for the rush of cold water to pour in through the open doors and windows, trapping us all in this underwater coffin. But… they didn’t.

I was instead suddenly surrounded by utter silence, save for a dull wind, audible, yet I could feel nothing on my skin through the windows. I slowly raised my head and opened my eyes, noticing the pitched black night sky outside. Had I imagined what just happened? I could have sworn to God this ferry had just dropped straight down underneath the water. I saw it. I felt it happen! But alas, there was the night sky, right there. I could not hear the typical sounds of the harbour anymore, and I wondered if we were even still in Sydney.

I got up from my seat, intending to take a look outside at what was going on. Slowly I slid open the door to the Starboard side deck, and I very carefully stepped out, painfully aware of the many hidden threats that may lie waiting out there. What met my eyes this time, however, was so much worse than anything I had yet seen on this journey.

As I gazed over the side of that ferry, seeing no water at all beneath us, and observing the green and blue ball suspended in vast, black nothingness, slowly disappearing into the darkness we were now floating off into, I realised with a dizzying horror… Not only were we not in Sydney Harbour anymore… we were not even on ***Earth*** anymore…",1,1738127882.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

(Part 4),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i39fcl/do_not_board_sydneys_midnight_ferry_service_there/) | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i4td3k/do_not_board_sydneys_midnight_ferry_service_there/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i77xq0/do_not_board_sydneys_midnight_ferry_service_there/)

Do you fear the water? I do. Of all the phobias which exist, I imagine this one is among the most common a lot of us share. I invite you to imagine just how it felt for me in that moment. Picture yourself in a deep, yet relatively safe body of water. Maybe a diving pool. You look down to see your legs dangling above the bottom of the pool, 16 feet down. Not scared yet? Okay… now imagine the complex is empty, it’s night time. You watch as the lights are all switched off one by one, and suddenly you are alone. All you can hear is the gentle swish of the water, and perhaps now there are subtle thoughts nagging at the back of your mind. Is the bottom still there? Which way is out? What’s underneath me?

Now, take away the swimming complex, you’re not there anymore. No, now you’re floating in a lake. It’s not huge, you can see the shoreline, and it’s only around 20 feet deep. You know this lake well, you swim here often. Yet still, it is night time, there is no one else around you, and while the human part of your brain knows that there are no dangers in this lake, those primal fears that still dwell deep within your DNA makeup don’t know that. What was that splash of water behind you? A small wave? Or something moving? But no… you know this lake. You know that you are safe.

Now imagine you have no such comforts. You are kilometres off shore, floating in the rough seas of the South Pacific. There is over 13 thousand feet of dark waters underneath you, it is the middle of the night, and you know without a shred of doubt that there are things swimming around underneath you. It is impossible to accurately describe the fear that one feels in that situation. So like I said, I invite you to attempt to imagine it.

For the first few minutes on end I was practically hyperventilating. Waves were rising up, smacking me across the face, and I was struggling to tread water and keep myself afloat, such was my state of panic. I remember the pain in my neck as I snapped my head around every which way, frantically looking for any sign of hope, only to see an endless dark horizon in every direction. I recall the moment I managed to somewhat calm my panicked mind, the dizziness subsiding, and my breath returning to something that resembled normal. That, of course, was the moment the true fear set in. That fight or flight mode tends to keep you distracted enough that you don’t need to focus on the reality of the terrible situation you are in. It was when I calmed a little, began breathing steadily and treading water naturally, that it all hit me at once.

I felt so small. Quite literally, a drop in the ocean. I tried so hard to stay focussed, but all I could think about as I flailed there in the ocean was how quick and easy it would be for a great white shark to swim by and sink its teeth into my abdomen. I wouldn’t even know it was coming. It was so dark, and the sounds of the wind and the waves would drown anything out. I would just be floating there whole one minute, then I would be a bleeding corpse the next. I thought about how pointless a death that would be. It’s strange, but these are the things you think about when you are facing such a reality. Sharks don’t even like the taste of humans. I wouldn’t even be a satisfying meal for a hungry predator. I would just waste away out there, slowly disintegrating for nothing.

And then it happened. Shocking me out of my morbid thoughts, as though only to confirm them, a slight tickle on the bottom of my foot. I snapped backwards quickly, though I did not look down. I continued treading water, hoping, praying that whatever had just touched me had been a stray piece of seaweed or something harmless like that. I imagined my legs dangling down there. I imagined a mouth opening up as a tiger shark raced up from the depths, ready to close its jaws around my feet. I shook my head, trying to shake those awful thoughts from my mind… And there it was again. But not just a tickle this time, no, I felt something grasp around my ankle. I pushed myself backward again, and took a few backstrokes away from where I was. What the hell was that?! Something had just grabbed me! No shark can do that.

I was quickly returning now to my panicked state, my primal brain screaming at me to get out of the water, but of course that not being an option. I told myself I had to keep calm, and did so the best I could. I forced myself to breathe to a rhythm, and I forced myself to keep treading water slowly, to not thrash about, to conserve energy. Yet, every few minutes or so, I would feel it again. That feeling of something slippery and slimy poking, grabbing and prodding at my feet and legs. For those arduous hours that I was out there in the blackness of the ocean, this thing’s behaviour continued. Every so often I would just start swimming. I don’t know how far I got, the tide was strong and I could feel currents pulling me back the way I came. But, no matter how far I thought I swam, this thing pursued me. At one point, I felt the distinct sensation of some kind of tentacle wrapping around my thigh. I could feel it squeezing tighter, almost to the point that I could not kick that leg any further, and I almost resigned myself to drowning in that moment. I don’t know what it was, and I still don’t know why it let go. But that would be the last I felt of it.

Minutes later, after what I can only estimate was around 3 hours stranded in the middle of the ocean alone, I heard a sound that I never imagined could bring me such comfort.

***Bwooom! Bwooom!***

I looked around, and there it was, its bright spotlight shining straight on me. I was not ignorant to the fact that I was about to be going from the fire back into the frying pan, I was just grateful I was going to be out of the former. The ferry’s engined slowed to a crawl, as it began spinning around, turning to face the Portside of the ship toward me. On deck stood two pale figures. I must impress, these figures, while humanoid, were clearly not human beings. For one thing, they were naked, yet featureless. Their faces blank slates. I mean, they did have faces, they were just devoid of any emotion or intent. I did wonder for a moment what these things’ intentions were, did they mean me harm? Were they here to finish me off? Were they here to simply taunt me as I continued flailing helplessly in the water until I inevitably drowned?

Thankfully, none of these theories were true, as a second later I watched them hurl a life ring out to me. The way they moved was bizarre. Every motion was in parallel unison with each other. Both arms swung out like a perfect mirror image as they threw the floatation device out to me. Then, after I grabbed on, they once again, in perfect unison, began reeling me in. When I reached the side of the ferry, they continued their bizarre synchronised routine, reaching down and tossing over a rope ladder, which I proceeded to climb up, dragging myself onto the deck of the ferry. Exhausted, I lay there for a few moments, thankful to be out of the water, yet painfully aware I had only prolonged the misery of my foreseeable destiny. After a minute or so laying there and catching my breath, I rolled over, reached out for the railing and pulled myself back up to my feet. I stood up to face these… things. They stared at me, still standing side by side, a side by side reflection of eachother almost perfectly. The difference now, is that one did indeed have an expression on its face, and not a pleasant one. It stared at me with a scowl on its face. I didn’t feel like I was in any immediate danger from these things though. More than anything, he looked pissed off. I was just about to open my mouth and thank them, when out of nowhere, he slapped me!

Seriously! I shit you not. This… thing, without a single change in expression, with zero hesitation, lifted its hand and slapped me across the face! I could only stare at this asshole, a look of absolute bewilderment on my face, as they both turned and walked away. Once again, they moved in perfect synch with one another. I watched them round the corner out to the rear deck, and that was the last I ever saw of them. Jesus… just when I thought this ferry could get no weirder! I lifted a hand to my face, rubbing it slightly. My God that hurt!

I wouldn’t have too long to dwell on it though, as in that moment my eyes were drawn to an almighty crash from the ocean behind me. Water from whatever had been responsible for this disturbance splashed all over me, drenching the deck. I staggered back a little, as the ferry itself creaked and groaned as it swung to one side, before crashing back down again. I rubbed the salty water from my eyes, my vision blurry, as I heard the ferry’s engines roaring back to life. We began to pick up pace now, as I stumbled my way over to the railing, leaning over and glancing out into the ocean. There was no mistaking it this time, there was something massive beneath those waves. It moved with purpose, its form swaggering from side to side as it drifted through the water. Whatever it was, it did not seem capable of immense speed. It quickly fell behind the more the ferry picked up pace, powering away into the night.

I thought of a couple of things in that moment. My first thoughts, of course, being the hours I had spent floating in those waters, with that thing poking and prodding at me. Had it been this giant which was taunting me all that time? And if so, why did it not pull me down into the depths with it? The second thought that crossed my mind were the ferry’s seemingly random trips out to sea. Could it be the case that whatever this thing was, was hunting us? Were these back and forths out into deeper waters not random at all, and simply the Captain trying to stay one step ahead of this monster? I did not know. All I knew in that moment was that I was glad I was not down there with it. Taking one last glance out to sea and noting the sun just beginning to peak its head over the distant horizon, I slid open the door to the cabin and stepped on back inside. It didn’t take long then for the physical exhaustion to catch up with me. Adrenaline had worn off, my fight or flight response could keep my physical limitations from giving out no longer. My legs turned to jelly, and I collapsed right there where I stood…



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I awoke a few hours later to a gentle hand shaking me. Honestly, I was tempted to just ignore whatever the hell it was and continue sleeping, perhaps forever, such was the stink of death on me at this point.

*“Sir… it’s almost closing time!”*

Café Guy’s voice was both a soothing presence and a harrowing reminder that I had once again awoken to yet another day of this nautical nightmare. I slowly sat up, stretching a little and rubbing my eyes before letting out a monstrous yawn. I noticed the ferry was idle once again, and I wondered where we might be. I was about to speak up in response when I was cut off by the obnoxiously loud P.A. system.

*“Attention passengers! We will be making our departure momentarily. The café service will close soon. A reminder to all, please remain inside the vessel and seated. If you need to stretch your legs or get some fresh air, please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Right… that was clearly directed at me, I thought. Apparently I had broken yet another weird rule. What the hell was I meant to do? There was a giant freaking cargo ship about to smash into us! Was I supposed to just stand there and die? Then again, that clearly had been some kind of hallucination. Or was it? I quite literally felt it roar past above me when I was down there…

*“Sir… I must insist that we move things along.”*

I glanced up, realising Café Guy was holding out a hand to me. I grabbed hold and he helped me up off the floor. My clothes were still all damp, and I stunk like a wet dog.

*“Ah… thanks mate.”* I said, as I struggled to find my footing, my body still very weak.

“Come on… let’s fix you something to eat,” Café Guy spoke warmly, smiling that trademark smile. He really did have something of a calming effect among all this madness. I followed him over to the café counter, and without even asking, he began cooking up a variety of different pastries, fresh sandwiches and salads. I didn’t care what he was making for me, I was ravenous enough to eat absolutely anything by this stage. My energy levels were near on non-existent, so my legs could attest to as I fell backwards into a row of seats. Café Guy noticed this, glancing over at me with a sombre look of concern on his face. Before long, he finished up what he was doing and packed all his creations into a bag for me, bringing it over along with a steaming hot cup of coffee. I was grateful for his presence on this otherwise awful ferry. It was nice to know I had a friend, despite everything else.

*“Here you are Sir,”* he said, handing me the food and the coffee. I didn’t even wait, grabbing out one of the beef and potato pies and taking a voracious chomp into its hearty goodness. I realised part way through my shameless display that Café Guy was staring at me. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, no, for the first time he actually looked like he was trying to hold back laughter.

*“Oh my God… I’m sorry! Geez… thanks mate. I appreciate it! It’s um… it’s really good!”* I stammered out, laughing a little myself as I did so and taking a sip of my coffee in an attempt to bridge myself back into a state of civility. Café Guy chuckled softly and shook his head a little, but after a moment that spark of happiness left his face. He suddenly looked sombre again, and he just stared for a moment before speaking up again.

*“You need to be more careful young man. You’re lucky we found you all the way out there! I’m sure you know this by now, but there are more to these waters we sail than meets the eye.”*

Finishing up my mouthful of pie, I nodded my head in response. *“Yeah… I sure do. I saw something down there early this morning, after they pulled me out of the water. It was huge. I’m pretty sure whatever it was had been trying to grab me when I was in the ocean too…”* I said, turning to face him now.

Café Guy slowly shook his head, before looking me in the eyes as he spoke again. *“If one of those wanted to take you, you’d be gone.”*

I froze upon hearing those words. So many things running through my brain all at once. There was more than one? What were they? What was their purpose? And… “*if* it wanted to take me”…? Is that the only reason I’m still breathing? Because this thing was in a good mood? The weight I felt in that moment was crushing, thinking back to my helpless self floating in that water. I shuddered at the thought of it.

Café Guy noticed this, and placed a hand gently on my shoulder. He spoke once more in that calming tone of his. *“Don’t you dwell on it sir. Things have a way of working out in the end,”* he said, before taking a glance down at his watch. He stood up, walking back over to the café and crouching down. He pulled out his set of keys and opened up a small locker beneath the counter. He pulled out a neatly packed bag, before locking back up, standing up and walking back over to me.

*“I have a feeling you need these more than me,”* he said, looking down at my still damp clothes. *“They’re clean and freshly washed, they should fit you. No need to give them back. I shan’t be needing them.”*  


I glanced back at him, smiling a little myself now. *“Thanks mate… I appreciate you. I mean, I still don’t know what your deal is here, but you’ve been kind to me, and if by some miracle I make it back to the real world, I won’t forget it,”* I said to him, before reaching out my hand to shake his. He accepted my gesture, firmly shaking my hand, before turning and walking away.

So there I was again. Just me and the ferry, and the ever increasing number of strange passengers boarding it. I had given up hope of trying to get off this thing. If what I experienced in the sea was any indication of what the world outside had become, it seemed that I was safer in here than I was out there. For now though, I just wanted to get comfortable. Placing my bag of food down on my row of seats, I took the clothes Café Guy had given me and made my way downstairs to the bathroom to get changed. As I stepped down off the final step, I scanned the lower level of the ferry, noticing that both sides had now almost filled up. There must have been some more… “stops”, in the time that I was floating out there. Looking around the crowd, I noticed that some of the passengers we were picking up were looking less and less human. In the beginning, when I first noticed this shift in appearance, it was just subtleties. Like I said, the kind of human-LIKE appearance you get from an AI image generator. But now, this was even more pronounced. Some of the figures seated in the back right hand rows had these thick, rubbery looking heads sporting blank, almost faceless expressions as they turned their gaze toward me. Others were very unnaturally tall and thin, looking like they had been placed between two giant vice clamps and forcibly stretched out. Then some among the crowd had almost no human appearance what so ever, humanoid in shape being as close as they got. Many of them looked to have been pulled straight from the sea just as I was, their bodies covered in seaweed with clams and barnacles still hanging off soggy flaps of skin.

I quickly looked away from these humanoid “nothing-people”, as I had come to refer to them, as I noticed almost all of them were staring at me now. They were making me feel uneasy, and I didn’t like it. The fact that they just sat there and stared was in some ways worse than if they had been doing anything outright malicious. I slipped my way past the back row of seats, shivering as my arm brushed against the scraggly mess of dank, wet hair belonging to one of the passengers. I quickened my pace, rounding the corner and shutting myself inside the bathroom to change. Opening up the bag, I found a set of blue jeans and a white polo shirt. Very casual, I thought. Thanks Café Guy! I quickly changed into the dry clothes, stepped out and chucked my now surely ruined set into the trash. I sighed as I glanced out over the deck. We were back in Sydney Harbour once again, a sight I once cherished every time I laid eyes on it, but now? A landscape of pure dread. There was no one out there now. I don’t mean like the first couple of times where I could at least see shadows of people in the distance. This time there was just… no one.

I woefully turned my gaze away from this depressing landscape and made my way back upstairs to my row of seats. The upper floor was now my one and only safe haven away from the nothing-people. Even the group of convicts that had tried to attack me last night had now made their way down the stairs to join the rest of them, neatly sat in rows, all facing straight ahead, aside from their dopey stares toward me whenever I would show myself around them. It seemed the only time they ever broke from this trance was to herd themselves up the stairs and get their morning meals. Sitting down in my little corner, I grabbed out a sandwich and started munching away as the ferry made its way through the harbour once again. I wasn’t even all that shocked anymore, as I glanced out at the rotting scenery around me. Once again, same as yesterday, the ferry started pulling in to various ports, and again, they looked absolutely nothing like I had once known them to. The Maritime Museum wharf, which proudly houses the HMAS Vampire, now featured only the decaying hull of a ship half sunken in the harbour. As we began to sail out of the harbour and back toward the Parramatta River, I dared not look as we passed by Goat Island, seeing enough merely out of the corners of my vision to deter me from directly looking at whatever horrors were stomping their way across the shores. They were massive, whatever the hell they were, and I shifted away from the window and into one of the centre rows of seats, afraid that they might reach out for me.

Onwards we sailed, up and down the river and around and about the harbour, continuing this now monotonous routine of pulling into random stops, some I didn’t even know existed, and picking up more travellers. I stayed put right where I was, but every time a new group of them would board, my eyes stayed locked on the stairwell ahead of me, silently praying that none of them would make their way up here again. It must have been nearing about 4pm that day when it happened. I was out on deck getting some fresh air, just watching out over the water ahead, when I noticed the ferry was picking up speed. It was moving unusually fast, and this frightened me, but not near as much as what came next. I gripped the rail tight as the ferry began to turn, our heading now directed straight into the bank of the river. I thought this must be a mistake. I was sure that at any moment we would adjust our course back out into open space. But we didn’t, we only picked up speed. We were about 20 metres from the shoreline now, and I was just about to jump off the side again when I remembered the words from earlier…

*“Please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Now mere moments away from smashing into the shoreline, I grabbed the railing as tight as I possibly could, bracing for the oncoming impact… and then suddenly, my grip loosened, as my eyes met the impossible sight ahead of me. With an unearthly groan, the land itself began to morph before my very eyes. Within seconds, a new passage of water had opened up, a mass of twisted mangroves forming a tunnel around it. At speed, we blasted through the opening, as a crash of thunder erupted from the sky, much like when we had entered Botany Bay, and I cringed in terror, once again fearing I may be struck down by lightning.

But all was quiet, and the ferry began to slow its pace now. As I rose back up to my feet, I looked around in astonishment at the surroundings we now found ourselves within. We were trekking through a mangrove ridden swampland, the buzz of mosquitos and the stink off the muddy riverbank thick in the air. I was well travelled, and there was only one place in this country I had witnessed this kind of scenery. A soft clunk against the hull of the ferry, and the swish of a thick, reptilian tail disappearing beneath the water confirmed what I was thinking. We were not in Sydney anymore, we were traversing through a northern mangrove river.

My head began to spin. I’m not sure why, surely I should be used to this madness by now, but somehow this damned ferry managed to up the stakes yet again. I stumbled backward, turning around to go back inside, when I was met with the sight of yet another crocodile. This one, its head slightly elevated out of the water, as they tend to do before they jump, its jaws open slightly. I kept my eyes locked on it, ready to throw myself backward should it make a move, but not wanting to be the one to move first and startle it into striking. The ferry gurgled along through this murky hellscape, as the world around me became progressively weirder. Dark mists were now rising up out of the water, and more creatures began swimming around, circling the vessel. The more I got a good look at them, the more I realised how wrong I had been. They were not crocodiles. Too big. Even the most monstrous of crocs ever seen in Australia capped out at around eight and a half metres. These things circling the boat were at least twice that, looking more like the ancient Sarcosuchus than a modern day crocodilian. I took another couple of steps back, and suddenly, the P.A. system crackled to life again…

*“Attention… for your own safety, remain inside the ferry. Stay away from the water, and do not look outside.”*

They didn’t need to tell me twice. I quickly, yet quietly, made my way back inside and took my seat again, this time, keeping my eyes front. For hours we sailed through this natural maze, until I finally felt the ferry begin to swing in to a stop. Once again, the P.A. system exploded with static…

*“Attention! Remain inside the vessel! Keep your eyes closed! I repeat! KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!”*

Catching sight of the long, twisted jetty winding out from within the dark mangroves ahead, and the barest glimpse of the tall, stretched out nothing-people lined up along it, I did exactly what the P.A. voice instructed. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and did everything I could to turn my focus away from what was outside. A screeching sound rang out as the ferry swung in to dock, followed by the regular clangs out on deck as Ramp Guy hurled the now busted up metal foot bridge out onto the pier for these awful things to board the ship.

I could hear quiet whispers, along with the soft buzz of insects and the lapping of the water against the shoreline. I then heard the tapping of what sounded like sharp, pointed feet, clicking their way across the ramp. And finally, I heard the sound of the ramp being pulled back in and the gates latching shut. The ferry then floated there for a few minutes, as I listened to the new arrivals getting seated downstairs, their whispers now fading away as they no doubt joined the rest of the mindless drones in their ever present state of nothingness. Once I could hear them no more, and was satisfied that they were of no threat to me, I opened my eyes…

*“Please don’t be real,”* I thought, as I immediately shut my eyes once again.

Something… was looking straight at me. Through the window. Right next to my head. The window which was only half closed, leaving no barrier between us. I dared not continue to look, but what I saw was enough. It was clung to the windowsill, its face half pressed against the glass. The rest of its body hung limp across the deck of the ferry, its legs dangling out over the side. I pressed my eyes shut as tightly as I could, as I felt its breath on my neck, and heard it whispering between breaths.

*“Can you help me?”* It said, between ragged breaths.

I slid myself over to the farthest seat in the row I was in, but even then I could still feel its breath, and I could now feel its hand, sliding up against me, as if it were desperately trying to grab onto me.

*“Please… help me…”* It spoke again.

I once again felt a slimy hand uselessly attempting to grasp at my arm. I was crying silent tears now. I wanted to get up and run, but I did not know what else was around me. Perhaps I would be running straight into another of its kind.

*“Help… me…”* It spoke just one more time, as the ferry began to pull away from the jetty, and I heard it slide off the deck, and plop into the water. Its fate from that point? I do not know. Not once did I open my eyes again as the ferry continued sailing through this otherworldly land. Every so often, I would hear the ferry pick up pace, followed by that familiar crash of thunder again, before slowing down and continuing to make more stops. All the while, I could hear things boarding the vessel. Some would speak in tongues I could not possibly understand. Others spoke in languages I recognised, but did not know. Spanish, Mandarin, a variety of Asian and European languages as well as many others. I would hear the odd American or British accent, and in amongst it all I would also hear terrifying voices. Mixtures of groans, clicks and gurgles. All manner of specimens were being herded onto this ferry. But for what? I had no idea, nor did I really want to know anything about what was happening around me.

It wasn’t until we were back in Sydney Harbour that I opened my eyes again, and how I wish I had not. The ferry picked up pace, roaring through yet another of these portal things, and once we were through, I heard the familiar sounds of the harbour once more, feeling comfortable enough to look outside. First glance was not enough, I had to be certain of what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, shook my head, and looked again.

As the ferry slowly sailed down the harbour, a terrible sight lay before me. Sydney was no more. I mean, it was there, kind of. The beautiful cityscape I had gazed upon so many times, was now an apocalyptic wasteland. The Sydney Tower, once standing proudly high above the city, had been snapped off midway up. The buildings were in ruins. The Sydney Harbour Bridge lay in shambles, broken off in the centre, and each side hanging downward. I watched in horror as hordes of these nothing-people wandered across the decaying bridge from both ends, toppling into the harbour as they reached the tipping point in the centre. The Opera House, once a proud symbol of our beautiful city now lay in pieces, its iconic sails scattered all over.

I turned away from this nightmare, forcing my eyes to look at anything else, but what I saw inside was no better. The ferry was almost full now. Many more nothing-people had entered the vessel during our ventures down that river, and wherever the hell else we had been. All over the world, by the sounds of things. The upper floor was no longer my safe haven away from them, as it too was now almost full, the entire opposite side now filled with figures taking all manner of forms. All of them, staring squarely at me.

I looked away from them, feeling uneasy, yet relatively assured that if the previous days were any indication, once they were boarded and seated, they meant me no harm.

The ferry continued to sail up and down the harbour, and a few more stops and pickups were made, all the while I tried my best to relax, to sit back and not draw any attention to myself. And I managed to do just that. Even as my own side of the ferry began to fill up with boarding travellers, I somehow managed to keep my head. That was until the end of the day.

It was around 7pm that night, when the ferry went down. No… I don’t mean it powered down for the night. I mean it dropped ***straight down!***

Any composure I had managed to maintain went out the window, as I tucked myself down in my seat, preparing for the rush of cold water to pour in through the open doors and windows, trapping us all in this underwater coffin. But… they didn’t.

I was instead suddenly surrounded by utter silence, save for a dull wind, audible, yet I could feel nothing on my skin through the windows. I slowly raised my head and opened my eyes, noticing the pitched black night sky outside. Had I imagined what just happened? I could have sworn to God this ferry had just dropped straight down underneath the water. I saw it. I felt it happen! But alas, there was the night sky, right there. I could not hear the typical sounds of the harbour anymore, and I wondered if we were even still in Sydney.

I got up from my seat, intending to take a look outside at what was going on. Slowly I slid open the door to the Starboard side deck, and I very carefully stepped out, painfully aware of the many hidden threats that may lie waiting out there. What met my eyes this time, however, was so much worse than anything I had yet seen on this journey.

As I gazed over the side of that ferry, seeing no water at all beneath us, and observing the green and blue ball suspended in vast, black nothingness, slowly disappearing into the darkness we were now floating off into, I realised with a dizzying horror… Not only were we not in Sydney Harbour anymore… we were not even on ***Earth*** anymore…",2,1738127769.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

But if you are a new driver or someone who isn't comfortable driving at higher speeds to keep up with the traffic flow, please pick a lane and stick with it, so that the others can overtake and go about their businesses.

Yesterday, I was being blocked by an SUV driver from BEML gate to HAL main gate. He was sticking to the median line and blocking the entire road driving at a slow speed, when there were no vehicles in front of him.  If this was a goods vehicle or three wheeler, going slow is understandable. But going slow in the middle of the road blocking the traffic is not.

Finally when I managed to overtake him, I wanted to drive very very slow in front of him, but the moment I got closer, he started honking. I had snacks and coffee, so I decided to mind my own business and get home instead of trying to teach him road ethics.

Then I encountered two very slow women drivers on old airport road. They kept to a lane and drove at a steady pace making it easier and safe to overtake. I used to laugh at female driver jokes, but I don't think I should anymore, ahole being gender neutral and universal and all.

I need to start this post with the biggest, most heartfelt **THANK YOU** I can possibly put into words. A few months ago, I shared [3tekken.com](https://3tekken.com/) here—a little passion project I built so we could all relive Tekken 3 in our browsers. The love, support, and nostalgia you poured into that post? It literally kept me up at night (in the best way). You didn’t just play the game—you shared stories, gave feedback, and reminded me why retro gaming matters so much to *all* of us.

But here’s the thing: **you inspired me to dream bigger.**

After seeing how many of you wanted to revisit *other* classics, I thought… *“What if I could give back even more?”*

So, after months of late nights, way too much coffee, and a borderline unhealthy obsession with emulator code… I’m beyond excited to share this with you:

[**My Emulator Online**](https://myemulatoronline.net/)  
**Play 20,000+ retro games—instantly, for free, no downloads.**

This isn’t just Tekken 3 anymore. We’re talking:

* **PS1**, **N64**, **SNES**, **Game Boy**, **Sega Genesis**, **NES**, **Nintendo DS**, **Atari**, and **dozens more**
* Classics like *Metal Gear Solid*, *Super Mario 64*, *Pokémon*, *Sonic*, *Zelda*, *Final Fantasy*… and yes, *Tekken 3* is still there too 😉
* Every game runs right in your browser. Just click and play.

This project isn’t about me—it’s about **us**. It’s for the late-night nostalgia trips, the “*remember when…*” moments, and the joy of sharing these games with friends (or finally beating that boss that haunted your childhood).

**Why am I doing this?**  
Because *you* showed me how much this community cares. Cuz retro gaming isn’t just about pixels—it’s about the memories, the laughs, and the connections we make. And honestly? Because I still can’t believe how many of you trusted a random internet stranger’s Tekken 3 site. The least I can do is try to repay that kindness.

**If you’re curious:**  
👉 Try it here: [My Emulator Online](https://myemulatoronline.net/)  
👉 Let me know what you’d love to see next (seriously, your feedback built this!)  
👉 Share it with someone who needs a dose of nostalgia today

This is just the beginning, and I’m *so* grateful you’re here for the journey. From the bottom of my heart—thank you for believing in a crazy idea, for cheering me on, and for keeping the spirit of retro gaming alive.

Now, who’s up for a *Street Fighter II* rematch? 🕹️

**P.S.** To the legends who asked, “What’s the BIG announcement?!” in my last post—*this is it*.  
**P.P.S.** If the site crashes because 10,000 of you try to play *Chrono Trigger* at once… no regrets. Let’s make some new memories.

I wanted to understand why this endless scroll through highlight reels had such a chokehold on my mental health. So, I started digging, reading studies, and even chatting with friends who felt the same. Here’s what I found:

* **Comparison culture is baked in:** Social media isn’t just showing us people’s best moments—it’s magnifying them. Psychologically, it’s called upward comparison, and it’s almost impossible to avoid. Research shows constant comparisons can tank your self-esteem and leave you chasing impossible standards.
* **We’re addicted to the wrong things:** Ever notice how time disappears when you’re on TikTok or Insta? That’s not an accident. Platforms are designed to keep us hooked using dopamine hits—the same brain chemical that fuels addictions. It’s like being stuck in a casino, except the slot machines are videos of cats and “that girl” routines.
* **It’s rewiring how we think:** Social media is shortening our attention spans and rewiring our brains to crave instant gratification. Ever start a book and give up halfway because it’s “too slow”? Yeah, me too. Turns out, constantly feeding on bite-sized content makes it harder for our brains to focus on anything long-form.

After realizing all this, I knew I needed to break the doomscroll cycle. I didn’t delete my accounts (lol, too real), but I made some changes. One of the best swaps I made? Replacing social media with reading. It was hard at first (like, painfully hard), but now it’s my go-to when I’m bored. Here are five insights I learned from books that changed how I approach social media—and life:

* **stop trying to “do it all”**[Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://befreed.ai/book/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less-by-greg-mckeown) by Greg McKeown is a game-changer. It’s a bestseller for a reason. McKeown shows how constantly saying “yes” (to goals, opportunities, even social media trends) spreads us too thin. Instead, he teaches how to focus only on what truly matters. This book slapped me in the face—in a good way.
* **perfectionism is a scam**[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://befreed.ai/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection-by-bren-brown) by Brené Brown (a classic!) taught me that striving for perfection isn’t just exhausting—it’s destructive. Brown’s research on shame and vulnerability hits hard, and it’s helped me stop comparing myself to airbrushed lives online. It’s like a warm hug in book form.
* **find joy in “boring” moments**Stolen Focus by Johann Hari opened my eyes to how social media is stealing our ability to savor the present. Hari explains how constant distractions are eroding our happiness and gives practical tips for reclaiming our focus. This book made me want to throw my phone into the ocean (but, like, responsibly).
* **you don’t need to be available 24/7**Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism dives into why we feel glued to our phones and how to build a healthier relationship with tech. Newport argues that being constantly connected is draining us, and he offers actionable steps to reclaim our time. This book is basically therapy for your phone addiction.
* **life isn’t a competition**[The Art of Happiness](https://befreed.ai/book/the-art-of-happiness-by-dalai-lama) by the Dalai Lama and Howard Cutler is a timeless reminder that true happiness doesn’t come from outdoing others—it comes from within. This book gave me a whole new perspective on what “success” really means.

Now, I’m not saying social media is all bad (cat memes, anyone?). But it’s worth asking yourself: Is it adding value to your life—or quietly draining it? For me, reading has been a way to claw back control and reconnect with what really matters.

If you’ve felt this way too, know you’re not alone. It’s okay to step back, rethink your habits, and give yourself grace. Life’s too short to waste feeling miserable over someone else’s highlight reel. What’s been your experience? Let’s talk.",15,1738126825.0,DeepThoughts,3,1.0,False

I hate that I’m even here asking for advice on this. I’ve been alone so long and rejected so many times that I’ve become very cynical about anything dating related but I met a guy recently at my work & it seemed like we really hit it off. I work in a family practice doctor’s office as a receptionist and he’s a sales rep that one of our docs reached out to. He’s been in the office 3 times and each time it’s seemed like he’s been flirting with me. (I’m not exactly the best judge when it comes to this type of thing though & I was flirting back but again, not great at that either lol). He gave me his number the first visit to send a coffee order for the meeting he scheduled with the doctors, which isn’t unusual for sales reps. So he does have my number, but there’s been no communication outside of the office. Am I reading too much into it? Is it more likely he was just being a good salesman? I can’t stop thinking about him, which is extremely annoying, but I don’t want to make the first move in case he’s not interested and then have it be super awkward any time he comes into the office. It’s been like 8 years since I’ve dated anyone so I’m very out of my element here. ",0,1738126741.0,dating_advice,2,0.33,False

So two weeks ago at the rock climbing gym, I climbed with a 29F girl that I see every other week and I asked her if she wanna get coffee after the session. She said sure. I picked a table, asked what she was getting, paid for both of us, and began chatting away. I asked what she does for fun, we talked about our jobs, climbing shenanigans, and etc. Since she’s a teacher, I asked if she’s got a favorite student or what made her get into teaching etc. I kept her doing most of the talking but there was a couple of silence times here and there. I ended it after 30 mins and she thanked me for the coffee. 

Like wow I can’t believe this was my first ever coffee with a girl. 

Anyways it’s been two weeks and we haven’t contacted each other. She hasn’t initiated anything. Gotta be honest here I wanna secure the “bag” but I don’t want to be an asshole or needy.

I've lost 50lbs over two years by doing moderate cardio 3-4x a week. In July, I went to the ER for mild chest pain, palpitations, light-headedness, and shortness of breath. Tests were good, and was referred to a cardiologist. I had EKG, blood panel, x-rays, ultrasounds, stress tests, wore a heart monitor, and everything was negative. Just had my six month follow up, we agreed it was likely excessive caffeine working with my anxiety, some kind of panic attack, I guess. I was drinking 4 cups of coffee a day, and I'm now at about one per week. So that gave me some relief, and I haven't felt any symptoms since the episode anyway.

The Benefits of Black Coffee

Black coffee, a popular beverage worldwide, is more than just a wake-up drink. Packed with antioxidants, it offers a variety of health benefits when consumed in moderation.

One of its most notable advantages is its ability to enhance alertness and focus. Black coffee contains caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system, improving concentration, energy levels, and overall productivity. This makes it a go-to drink for many to kick-start their day or overcome fatigue.

Rich in antioxidants like chlorogenic acid, black coffee can help combat oxidative stress, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. It has been linked to better metabolism and may aid in weight loss. Caffeine boosts metabolic rate and promotes fat burning, making black coffee a preferred pre-workout drink for fitness enthusiasts.

Black coffee is also associated with improved liver health. Regular consumption has been shown to lower the risk of liver diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Additionally, it may help

This is my first post here, so I figured I would introduce myself before I get into the subject of the title. I am a baby witch who recently discovered this amazing Subreddit while online devouring as much information as I can about Witchcraft.

I have always been inherently lucky, and seem to have a freakish knack for making things happen for myself. My jam until recently was the Law of Attraction... My mom busted out ""The Secret"" on DVD when I was like 10 and lectured me about how I could ""rule the world"" if I just paid attention and tapped into my power. It was adorable lol. While practicing LoA has certainly benefitted me in my life, I feel very drawn to Witchcraft. I think it's so beautiful and versatile, and I love how every individual Witch seems to have their own special way of constructing their spells/rituals. It feels a lot more hands-on, and like I'm taking control of my own destiny. I feel so feminine and powerful when I practice Witchcraft! I haven't conjured up anything major yet, but I know it's only a matter of time!

⭐ Anyways, enough blabbing... Let's get to the good part!

My parents split and my mom moved across the country (I'm in the USA) five years ago. She's my bestie and it guts me every day that we don't live close to each other anymore. I also happen to LOVE the little town she moved to, and I want to live there so badly. The catch? My partner, young son, and myself live in a very expensive area and don't have the income to save up for a move. We have decent jobs here, but it's just impossible to get ahead financially. Doing the math, we likely need around $10,000 to get moved and settled into an apartment. We also need to line jobs up in the target area, which is proving very difficult. My partner IS willing to move with me if circumstances align, so nothing is being done against anyone's will here.

I am trying to figure out what sort of ritual(s) or spell(s) would be the most suited to materializing this move, or materializing the individual components required for the move (the money, jobs, etc.). I am very cautious because I don't want something bad happening to me or anyone in my family. Under no circumstances will I accept life insurance, inheritance, or injury settlement money to fund this move. If there's not a good way to establish this expectation in the spell, I would rather not try it. No move is worth the life or wellbeing of someone I love.

I have some objects that I figured could be useful in a spell too? A coffee cup with the town's postal code on it (my mom sent it to me and told me to use it to manifest living there haha) and a drink token from the bar at the fancy restaurant in the town that I brought home during one of my last trips there.

All insight/suggestions welcome! I am very aware that I am a newbie to this entire practice, and that it will take time and lots of patience to get this to happen. I'm in this for the experience and journey as much as the outcome.",0,1738125090.0,witchcraft,6,0.4,False

    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iclqjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycgaybros/comments/1iclqjf/friendships_evolving_as_we_age/,Friendships evolving as we age,"Hey nyc bros! I’m a 33 year old gay man in NYC who’s been here for about 13 years. I moved here immediately after college and the majority of my friends in the city are people I met during university and have remained close with for many years.

The past year or so, though, I’ve felt more distant from my friend group than ever. Two of my best friends are now both exploring open relationships, and while I can’t relate (I’m in a monogamous one myself), I try to be open-minded and non-judgmental.

I don’t mind that they’re both exploring being open, however the uncomfortable part is my best friend is dating someone who I don’t like and now he and his partner are both dating other people so when we get together I’m keeping track of SO many freaking details (which, again, is fine, just requires a lot of patience and space to keep up with the stories etc), but how does one of my best friends end up dating not one but TWO people I don’t like!?? For the record, I’ve spoken to him very recently about my qualms with his primary partner and I’ve agreed to move on (his partner and I don’t need to be best friends as long as my best friend is happy!).

It feels awful to feel this way about a friend of almost 16 years, but I feel like we have less and less in common each time we see each other. My best friend’s primary interest lately is mostly just sex or talking about sex, meeting more partners, drinking/going out, etc. and I find we have so little in common these days. Lately I’ve actually felt more shared interests with my female friends than my gays and it’s kind of awful to feel that way because I obviously cherish my gay identity and friendships but it feels more and more different from my two close friends’ lately.

Can anyone relate? Or am I just being a judgmental ole monogamous bitch? Have I neglected making new friends with similar interests (ie friends to go to the spa with or to yoga or on a hike or on a coffee walk in the park) to hold onto friendships that are no longer serving me?",2,1738124971.0,nycgaybros,2,0.75,False

  I want to thank all of the supporters who have stayed with me or just joined.  The continued interest in the blog site has resulted in a great opportunity and you are the reason.  


  I put NvN on hold for the time being because I am working with a publisher and expect to be ready for print this summer.  


You guys have spoken and I have heard you loud and clear.  This case needs a book written on facts.  Not another ""Roos=good; Watts=bad"" gloss over.  SW was apathetic on her best days.  On her worst days she was cruel.  To her children and her husband.  It's Bella and Celeste's story that needs written.  So, that's what I am going to do


  ""Why? Why? Why?"" Is the Shiner cry heard in every comment thread for the last 6 years.  Well, I am going to tell them why.  They aren't going to like it.  They'll hate me for it.  But I can live with that.. 

Thank you again,

As if being married to Keiko and having a foppish twink Brit best friend when you’re a working class Irish lad wasn’t bad ENOUGH…

Nothing ever good happens to this man. Ever. Quick vacay with the wife….and on trial in a Cardassian court. The weird time shifting episode. Turned into a replicant (and of fucking course even Replicant O’Brien is a sweet, decent man). His daughter gets turned into a time traveling caveman…er, woman. His wife gets turned into a Pah Wraith hotel for a while but is actually less of a naggy bitch. He doesn’t even get to be an evil badass in the Mirror universe. And guess what? Remember when the Orinoco blew up? His transport went through just fine. He didn’t get cross faded into the Holosuite. He just ended up there instead of the transporter pad. But he pretended to be Falco to blend in and eventually realized he WAS Falco. Falco was respected. Falcon was FEARED. And the bastards made him go back: back to being constantly bitched at when the coffee is cold or some docking bay clamp is stuck. Just when he gets a half-way decent helper, a young plucky Bajoran lass…and now that Keiko mentioned it…she’s not too bad lookin’….nope Nevermind Chief. Turns out she’s a terrorist. No joy. 

EVERY version of this man suffers. Real or fake or imaginary or cloned. Harry Kim is worshipped by the writers compared to O’Brien.

Now we don't have latex gloves and I've searched up and down our kitchen and house for a material that matches this one and none can be found. I posted this on another sub but I'm still stumped. For some reason this is really bothering me because I know for a fact this thing wasn't in our coffee basket before when I cleaned a few days ago.

I crocheted the most goofy looking egg shaped critter. 
I had two helpings of salad. 
I finished the bottle of adaptogen non-alcoholic spirits.
I ate a generous helping of homemade caramel brownies. 
And it has been an excellent night. 

I was dubious at first. It seemed my crochet project was going sideways which always makes me a little testy. Occasionally I thought about all the things that are troubling me, but I tried really hard not to. I wanted to just… relax tonight. 
I had a hard time at work today. When I wake up very early, I usually make coffee and then I journal. Recently, I have started work after journaling… around 5:30. On days like this, I don’t struggle as much as I would think. But today I did. I had a hard time producing new work. I was scattered and sleepy. It was a difficult day professionally. I made plans to go into the office tomorrow but we shall see. A visit to the office could be halted by any number of things. I picked out an outfit anyway. My partner usually sleeps most of Wednesday anyway. He is doing his podcast tonight and he stays up very late to record the after show. 

I want to feel good. I want my body to stop hurting. Tonight I could feel the tension everywhere… in my shoulders… my hips. 
I should go on a walk every day for the rest of the week. I always feel so good after a walk. 

I wasn’t going to take a bath but maybe I will.
Maybe I will bring one of my toys and see if I can get something going with myself.

So I’ve been at a fairly reasonable calorie intake each day I feel. Trying to keep it under 1k a day and some days I’m around 700-800 which I’m ok with. 
Today I woke up with basically no appetite for the most part but then I ended up eating 2,303 calories. So considerably higher today than my norm. 
(I really did NOT binge) this was all throughout the day and counting ALL of my calories including my morning coffee.
That said, the weight I have lost so far has strictly been from calorie restriction because I have not been exercising. 
When it’s cold I don’t want to move. Not making excuses it’s just the truth.
Anyway, today I only walked 1/2 a mile on my walking pad and that was about it for me.
Do you ever have days where you just actually want to eat more than normal out of no where??
I am not going to do this on a regular basis obviously. 
Just curious what everyone else notices with your appetite etc. as in, do you notice these kind of fluctuations??

Today, for the second time in a year, I had a sudden onset of extreme abdominal pain about two inches inferior to my xyphoid process. I’ve broken some bones and had gas pain and heartburn before…but nothing like this. I’m on a work trip staying at a hotel and I was rolling on the ground in agony. My whole body is immediately drenched in sweat, my breathing becomes ragged and labored, and no body position helps ease the pain. I called my wife and she said to go to the ER, but there was no way I could drive. After about 30 minutes the pain almost immediately disappeared. I sat in a chair trembling for another 30 minutes before getting back into bed.

Today I had a coffee, rice and chicken, and a chicken sandwich. I drank water all day and haven’t done anything out of the ordinary. I had a very similar experience almost exactly a year a go. Sudden onset and it went away about 30 minutes after as my wife was loading me in the car to go to the ER. Both times were right around 10pm.

My wife wants me to “go get it checked out”, but I’m in healthcare and I know how it goes. I had going to the doctor and I have no symptoms when I’m not having a pain episode. Any ideas?",1,1738124466.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Had one of those last week. Dishes piled up, laundry everywhere, unopened mail creating its own zip code on my counter.

My first reaction was the usual shame spiral. ""I'm such a mess. Why can't I just be a normal adult who keeps things clean?""

But then I noticed something. The mess had a pattern. Cups everywhere because I kept starting coffee I was too anxious to finish. Clothes on the floor from changing outfits, doubting how I looked. Unopened mail because I was avoiding dealing with things that stressed me out.

My apartment wasn't messy because I was lazy. It was messy because I wasn't okay.

Started treating the mess like a message instead of a personal failure. Each item became a clue:

* Piled up dishes? Probably feeling overwhelmed
* Cluttered desk? Mind's too full to focus
* Untouched hobby stuff gathering dust? Missing joy somewhere

Now when I notice things piling up, I ask myself what's really going on. Sometimes just naming it helps. Other times it's a sign I need to reach out or slow down.
