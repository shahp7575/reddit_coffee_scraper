My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metalhead vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",1,1738377607.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1iewf5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingStrangeness/comments/1iewf5z/something_is_not_right_with_alice/,Something Is Not Right with Alice,"""Alice has never been the type who's passionate about hanging out in crowded places, has she?"" Leyla sipped her iced coffee as she asked the question.

""Nope. Not in five years of friendship,"" I replied. I didn’t drink coffee—my stomach had an issue with it. So, I bit into my chocolate bar instead.

""What do you think changed, Elena?""

""Her apartment?"" I laughed. ""I mean, if you're asking what's recently changed in her life, she just moved. Not far from here.""

""Maybe that’s why she asked to meet up here?""

""Still extremely unusual. I mean, it’s Alice we’re talking about. There are plenty of not-so-crowded places around here.""

Leyla lifted her head, her expression shifting like she had just spotted something—or someone—she’d been waiting for.

""Speak of the devil. There she is.""

""The devil?"" I laughed again.

""No, Shithead! Alice!"" Leyla had always been an unpleasant woman.

I turned around to see Alice just a few steps behind me, walking with her long black hair swaying elegantly.

""It’s unusual for you to ask to meet up in a crowded place like this,"" I said as she sat down in the last chair at our table.

""Really? Oh. I guess I didn’t think it through,"" Alice replied casually.

Her answer made me uneasy. Something felt off about her that night, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

I watched as Alice and Leyla talked.

It was Alice. She looked like Alice. She wore Alice’s favorite outfit. But something about her didn’t feel right. Leyla didn’t seem to notice—or maybe she didn’t care.

""How about,"" Alice said to both of us, ""I invite you guys to my new apartment? It’s close by.""

We all agreed, and soon, the three of us were walking toward her new place.

We passed through the apartment gate, and I trailed behind Leyla and Alice, who were chatting as if they had the world to themselves. I paid close attention to Alice. The more I observed her, the more I felt like something was wrong.

""Alice,"" I called out her name.

""Yeah, El?"" she responded.

""What are the last four digits of my phone number?""

Alice laughed. ""How should I know? It’s your number, El. I have it saved, but I don’t remember it off the top of my head.""

Weird. The last four digits of my number were her birth date and month—a long-standing inside joke between us. She used to remember it effortlessly.

""Here we are,"" Alice said proudly.

Alice showed us her living room. It was stylish and cozy, with a single bedroom.

""What does the bedroom look like?"" Leyla asked, moving toward it.

""The electrical system is broken,"" Alice explained, opening the bedroom door and flipping the light switch. ""I’ll get it fixed first thing tomorrow.""

The light didn’t turn on—just as she said.

When they returned to the living room, my eyes caught something on the ceiling. It was dark inside, but with the help of the light from outside, I could see that the bulb in her bedroom wasn't installed.

So, it wasn’t the electrical system.

When I turned to close the door, I noticed something hanging at the bottom of the closet door. It looked like long, dark fabric.

My gut told me to check it out.

When Leyla and Alice weren’t paying attention, I slipped back into the bedroom. Kneeling down, I touched the fabric.

It wasn’t fabric.

It was hair. Long, black hair.

A chill ran down my spine.

Was it a wig? Or...was it someone?

Again, my gut urged me to open the closet door. Just a little—just enough to see inside.

The moment I realized what it was, I bolted upright, ran to Leyla, grabbed her hand, and dragged her out of the room.

""El? Hey! What the hell? Where are you taking me? What about Alice?"" Leyla muttered, confused.

I didn’t answer.

""El?!""

""Quiet. I’ll tell you later.""

Once we were outside the apartment building, I explained.

""So, what was it? A wig?"" Leyla asked, baffled.

""No,"" I replied, trembling. ""It was a person. A dead person.""

""What?! Who?!""

""Alice.""

""What the fuck, El? That’s absurd!"" Leyla shouted hysterically. ""Alice was just with me in the living room!""

""It was dark, but I was close enough to see it was Alice. Dead. In the closet. Which means there were two Alices. I don’t know which one’s real. But if the one in the closet is the real Alice, then we’re in grave danger.""

""Then who was the Alice who met us at the café?"" Leyla’s voice trembled.

""I don’t know!""

""What do we do now?""

""We tell the building guard and ask for help.""

Reluctantly, Leyla agreed.

Drew, the building guard, accompanied us to Alice’s apartment. We knocked. No answer. Drew unlocked the door with his spare key, and we stepped inside.

We found Alice in the closet.

Dead.

Leyla and I screamed in horror. After discussing with Drew, we decided to call the police and wait outside the apartment.

While we waited, I noticed someone leaving the apartment across from Alice’s. A beautiful woman with long black hair.

The moment I saw her, I felt uneasy—the same uneasiness I’d felt when Alice approached us at the café earlier that night.

I brushed it off and returned to my conversation with Leyla and Drew. But then, I felt someone watching me. I turned my head to see the woman who had come out of the apartment across from Alice's. She stood there, a few meters away from me, staring at me with a strange and eerie expression.

And then, for a fleeting moment, her face shifted.

It became Alice’s face.

Seconds later, it shifted back.

1iewbsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1iewbsq/storytime_ransomware_worst_case_scenario_2015/,"Storytime: Ransomware, worst case scenario (~2015?)","This took place before the age of double ransom - exfil and lockout. Some of you may recognize this story - if so, hi guys! And I apologize, this is a bit of a long one, but hopefully enjoyable in its sad cringey sort of way.

So a number of years ago I worked for a quite large NFP, I think we had probably around a thousand users at the time. Well, they used to be an NFP, not sure if they still are, at least fully. They got tired of selling all the Koolaid and started drinking it themselves, which is to say the execs wanted a lot more of the pie.

One morning I walk in and sit down at my computer and before I can log in the junior sysadmin says ""Hey, we got hit by ransomware"" and just starts laughing. He was a funny guy, and I couldn't always tell when he meant to be funny. I knew he was serious though. To myself I was like ""Well I don't need coffee now,"" and logged in to check for myself - maybe preserve my device. Lo and behold, those lovely little text files we all know and love sitting all over my desktop.

I confirmed I was seeing it too, and he laughs again and goes ""Yeah I'm watching files be encrypted realtime on the server. You should see this."" Walk over and take a look and sure enough one by one they're being encrypted, and just then the sysadmin walks in. He goes to his desk and the junior says ""Hey, we've got ransomware."" Without seeing anything he just goes ""No we don't.""

I go ""Yup, I just confirmed it, mine is locked too.""

He just snarkily goes ""Well maybe YOU have ransomware,"" as if to accuse me. I asked if he'd even taken a look knowing full well he didn't. He logs into his system and as it turned out HE had it too, something he was more than a little grumpy about. He looked over the shoulder on the junior and just rolls his eyes. After a few minutes the manager comes in and sees what's going on.

The manager himself was not a terrible sysadmin but he obviously didn't know a thing about ransomware, despite reading all day and watching lots of tech YouTube. He's throwing out completely absurd and unhelpful suggestions and I'm just shooting them down left and right. ""Pull the plug on the servers, now,"" I tell them. ""If we haven't taken stock of what's infected, it's clearly spreading across the network and we need to save what we can, or at least stop the spread.""

The sysadmin said something to handwave the suggestion saying we still didn't know what was infected, and one of the helpdesk said there were a bunch of tickets about ransomware from basically every site.

Just about then our fearless CTO walked in to say his usual (occasional) good morning. His demeanor said nothing was wrong to him, meaning he'd just gotten in as always. ""We have ransomware throughout the network, including servers,"" I told him to head off the denials. Apparently I hadn't headed them off. ""We don't know that"" the sysadmin said, still apparently doing nothing. ""Shut it all down"" is all I can say.

We showed him the files being encrypted, and the example of my desktop. He went to the sysadmin and just talked with him, who continued to deny everything. The manager went over to talk with them, again offering suggestions not based in reality. ""I found a product that can reverse ransomware!"" he said triumphantly. This was before some of the ransomware had started having decryptors published and other resolutions. Our AV had no idea what to do with it - Symantec as I recall.

""You can't reverse ransomware,"" I say. ""You need the encryption key and it won't know that.""

""This says it can!"" This goes back and forth for a bit, and having finally given up to let him chase his tail, I pull out my phone and send an all staff email informing everyone of the situation, and to shut down their computers. No point in letting the ransomware run wildfire.

The CTO never wipes his stupid selling you something smile off his face, and announces to the room ""It looks like you all have this under control. I have to leave to start my vacation for the long weekend. Let me know if you need anything!"" And like that, he's gone. I'm stunned. I knew he wasn't good for anything but I'm still shocked that he would just shrug off a company wide ransomware attack.

The manager comes back in with a blank look on his face and says ""It won't work, it needs to be installed before the ransomware attack."" I say again ""Because it needs to identify the key, which it gets in the process of it happening. Can we shut everything down now?""

Finally the manager starts managing enough to say ""Shut it down."" Our junior goes ""Oh, it finished encrypting a while ago,"" and shuts the servers down. The manager goes to his desk - I find out later he's got his head down and is sobbing because he knows what this means.

In a roundtable I suggest at this point it's faster for us to just start wiping devices and sneakernetting MDT image reinstalls. ""Do you know how long that'll take"" our Sr Helpdesk asks. ""Probably all weekend. But we have to get this back up, I'm up for it if you all are, but I'm not doing it alone. Get the MDT server restored first, and we can get running. Unplug from the network, reinstall from the image, and once that's done we can reconnect everything and get back online.

""Fine, let's do it.""

The sysadmin finally began recovering servers, and by Monday everything was back up. We had a few gripes about users who ""knew"" their system wasn't infected and were mad that they lost all their data that they should've had on the file server, but for the most part it was about as smooth as it could be.

I found out later they only wanted \~$30,000 in Bitcoin. We ended up losing \~$350,000 a day because the CTO couldn't be bothered to engage seriously - or probably to even know what the actual impact would be. Of course the Manager, Sysadmin, and ""Security"" officer who wasn't really all took the fall for him to have his unbothered vacation.

And in a final very neat postscript, I found out much much later that it was the sysadmin that caused all this. He'd been using his regular account which was a FOREST ADMIN, including password, on random sketchy sites and he got us popped. They used our own SCCM against us which explained how it was able to go so wildfire.",2,1738377133.0,sysadmin,0,0.75,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Setting up your first kitchen is an exciting milestone, and knowing the right first home essentials can make all the difference in creating a functional and inviting space. As you embark on this new journey, consider the must-have items that will transform your kitchen into a place where culinary creativity thrives.

To start, investing in quality cookware is essential. Look for a versatile set that includes:

- Mixing bowls to prepare and combine ingredients with ease

Next, small appliances can significantly enhance your cooking experience. A microwave and a toaster are invaluable for quick meals and snacks. If you enjoy coffee, a coffee maker should be part of your first home essentials list too. Moreover, a blender is perfect for smoothies and soups, making it a great multifunctional tool.

Storage solutions are also vital in any kitchen. Allocate space for:

- Pots and pans
- Food containers to keep leftovers fresh
- Spices and herbs for flavoring

Lastly, don't overlook the importance of dishware. A basic set of plates, bowls, and glasses will allow you to host friends and family while enjoying meals. With these first home essentials, your kitchen will not only be equipped for cooking but will also become a warm gathering place in your new home.

This persona of wanting the best for everyone; Devon, his baby, his friends and Mark is a facade at best and narcissistic perfectionism at worst. I don’t doubt that there’s going to be a reveal as to the bad vibes between him and Mark… beyond Mark being severed and the Gemma fallout etc. And I appreciate his book was essentially one of the main catalysts for the innies, especially Mark, beginning their revolution. But nevertheless, I still struggle to find him a likeable character. Ever since the dinnerless dinner with him outing Mark and myriad reasons beyond that. I can even see him becoming a Lumon turncloack if it meant furthering his career as a writer or otherwise. The only thing that could redeem him for me personally is if he embodies a ‘Heroic Sacrifice’ trope which they could potentially be building him up for, but I don’t think so.

What are your thoughts? Because for the most part many people seem to like him, I think because of the bangers he drops - which again I admit he does. The defence i’m preempting is that he’s just an innocent soul but I feel that this is invalidated when they were in the birthing hut… as soon as Devon left to get coffee, his demeanour totally changed as soon as he was alone with Mark, going from his over caring and overly nice persona to being dispassionate or cold at the very least.

We’ll see I guess!

I got this 20 year old LP new/unopened recently for less than the price of a cup of coffee.  Definitely worth a listen.

In the last 2 years I quit 3 times.

Once for a month. No withdrawals.

Once 6 months later... serious muscle aches in legs..

And now 5 days ago... experiencing nothing again..

At every 2 week mark. I crave coffee very hard, give in. Have one and I feel the coffee for the first few cups.. then it just becomes something that you must have first thing in the morning.. you know the story.. 

Anyway, I have been craving hot chocolates or icdd chocolates as a substitute this time around. 

But also to note, I recently had my own coffee shop.. this made end up drinking 3 medium flat white per day. Most I've ever consumed regularly...


Anyway, qll my friends have always said of this 24 hour headache they'd get, the famous coffee headache for not having caffeine in over 24 hours... I always thought it was odd I never had anything happen... despite being 37 and coffee daily since like 12..

So one day, when reading up about Phenylalanine, as I have PKU... I noticed that phe actually is said to help people with caffeine withdrawal... this I thought must be why I get next to no withdrawals...I always have 10x the normal person's Phenylalanine levels in my blood.


Anyone want to try getting Phenylalanine supplement and trying for themselves, or tried and did or didn't work?

I hope to make it easy the 30 days mark, and beyond this time around.. just weird that I find so much delight in a chocolate drink now.",1,1738376495.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Since that seemed a bit vague, I asked who he was going with and where. He told me the name of the restaurant (kind of like Moxies or Earls) and who he was going with. 

The woman he’s going with is someone that he works with that he supervises, since he’s kind of like the boss. She had an incident at work with a different employee that was being rude to her. My boyfriend said that they were going out to talk about the incident so he can come up with a game plan to speak to that other employee. 

Now I know that he needs to meet with her to both calm her down and get all of the facts, but it just feels kind of icky that they are going out for dinner at a somewhat fancy restaurant. Wouldn’t a conversation like this take place more over coffee, or at the office? 

I should mention that this is my first relationship, so I don’t really know what is considered normal or acceptable. We’ve been together for almost 3 years. 

There was also a time that I found pictures of this woman in a thong on my boyfriend’s phone. When I confronted it about it he said she was just showing him her new tattoo. I still feel weird about this. He did apologize and say that he would never act on anything, since he wouldn’t want to ruin what we have.

We had movie nights, cooked together, and had a few deep talks. I noticed him looking at me sometimes, but I didn’t overthink it. It was like this for weeks. In a group conversation, I casually mentioned that I wasn’t planning on dating in the US because I wasn’t into casual stuff, and long-distance wouldn’t make sense since I’m from Europe. The next day, he kinda changed. He stopped sitting next to me on the couch, made excuses like ""the floor is more comfortable,"" avoided eye contact, and eventually, we barely spoke.

I asked if something was wrong, and he just said he was stressed and ""processing some emotions"" but that it had nothing to do with me. This went on for two months. Right before moving out, I realized I had a crush on him and just blurted it out: ""Hey, I liked you at some point. Just take it as a compliment, that’s it.""
He looked surprised. ""Oh… you mean in a romantic sense?"" I hesitated, and he started grinning like an idiot. ""Uh…idk…yeah."" He laughed. ""Wow, I am surprised. I know it takes guts to say it"" Then he actually held really long eye contact (which he hadn’t done in ages) and kept smiling. I got flustered and apologized for making it awkward. ""No, don’t apologize."" Still smiling and staring. Then another roommate came back home and I just fled.
A minute later, he texted: ""Haha, that all happened so fast—wanna grab a coffee or something?"" We met for drinks a week later. At first we talked casually. Eventually, I asked: ""So why did you want to meet? Is there sth you want to say"" ""Just thought it’d be a nice way to wrap things up before you moved out."" Silence. Then he apologized three times for being distant and a bad roommate at the end. Silence. Then he asked ""What was your intention in telling me?"" I said I just wanted to get it off my chest. Silence. Then I admitted, ""I also wanted to say it so I could move on."" He looked surprised. ""I mean, I was leaving anyway."" Then he started asking things like:
""Do you have a crush on anyone back home?""
""Do you think you’ll end up with someone in the medical field?"" (I’m in medicine)
""How do you even get over a crush?""
A few days later, I texted him: ""Sorry, but I just want to ask one last thing—did you ever have any interest in me?"" He sent a long message: ""To be honest, I was dealing with a heartbreak, so I never had the chance to develop feelings for you. So no, I was never interested in you. But we barely know each other. Still, you’re a great person, and I appreciate you telling me.""

The thing is, I have no idea who this heartbreak was about. His last ex was from years ago. There were no women in our apartment. Maybe he got rejected by someone? No clue. I assumed that was the end of it.

Then, out of nowhere, he texted me again. First, he thanked me in the group chat for offering to help with a landlord issue. Then, four days later, he messaged me privately: ""Thanks for offering to help. How was your move?"" ""Yeah, all good."" ""When are you flying back to Europe?"" (He 100% knew the date—I told him again.) ""Let me know if you want to hang out before you leave.""

I didn’t answer right away. A week later, I said yes. He suggested dinner, made a reservation near my place, and showed up 10 minutes early. When I arrived, he hugged me—something we don’t usually do. He was really attentive during dinner, stopped eating to listen when I talked, and kept intense eye contact. Afterward, he suggested ice cream (which he paid for) and a walk.
At the end of the night, his energy shifted. He suddenly avoided eye contact again. I spread my arms and said, ""See ya."" He grinned. ""See ya."" I left without looking back or so. Then he went home. A few minutes later, he texted: ""Hope you got home safe.""

A week later, right before my flight, I sent him a message: ""Just wanted to say thanks for the help with the apartment."" He replied, ""Of course. It was nice getting to know you. Hope our paths cross again sometime. Have a good flight.""

At this point, I’ve fully moved on. But out of curiosity:
Did he ever like me? Or was this for an egopush or out of pity?

Smoothies provide a fantastic way to pack a wealth of nutrients into a single glass. By blending fruits, vegetables, and other healthy ingredients, you can easily consume a variety of vitamins and minerals that your body craves. Here are a few key nutrients to look for:

- **Vitamins:** Fresh fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of essential vitamins like Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and various B vitamins.
- **Minerals:** Ingredients such as spinach and nuts contribute important minerals like magnesium, potassium, and calcium.
- **Fiber:** Adding whole fruits and vegetables boosts your fiber intake, promoting better digestion.

### Natural Energy Boost

Instead of relying on caffeine, smoothies can provide a more stable form of energy. Ingredients like bananas, oats, and nuts release energy slowly, helping you avoid sudden spikes and crashes that often accompany coffee consumption.

This sustained energy comes from the carbohydrates and healthy fats present in your smoothie ingredients. You can feel energized without experiencing that jittery feeling from coffee.

### Hydration Helper

Starting your day well-hydrated is crucial for overall health. Many people overlook hydration, especially when consuming coffee, which has a diuretic effect. Smoothies, on the other hand, can be blended with water, coconut water, or other hydrating liquids, making them a great hydration option.

Staying hydrated helps improve your mood, energy levels, and cognitive functions. Adding hydrating fruits like watermelon or cucumber can enhance this benefit further.

### Weight Management Support

If you are watching your weight, smoothies can be a smart addition to your morning routine. When made with healthy ingredients, they can be low in calories while still being very filling. Instead of a high-calorie coffee drink loaded with sugars and creamers, opt for:

- **Green Smoothies:** These can be made with leafy greens like kale or spinach, paired with some fruit for sweetness.
- **Protein Smoothies:** Adding a scoop of protein powder, Greek yogurt, or nut butter can help keep you full longer.
- **Fruit-Only Smoothies:** Use low-calorie fruits like berries or melons to cut down on calories while still satisfying your sweet tooth.

### Immunity Boost

Many smoothie ingredients can significantly enhance your immune system. Ingredients like spinach, citrus fruits, and berries are packed with antioxidants and immune-boosting vitamins. This can help you fend off illnesses, making smoothies a proactive choice for your health.

### Easy to Customize

Smoothies are incredibly versatile. You can mix and match ingredients based on your taste preferences and nutritional needs. Got some leftover spinach? Toss it in! Need a protein boost? Add nut butter or protein powder! The options are endless, making it simple for you to create something you'll love.

### Quick Preparation

In our fast-paced lives, the convenience of a morning smoothie is hard to beat. Preparing one takes just a few minutes. Simply gather your ingredients, blend, and you're ready to go. Smoothies can even be prepped the night before to save time in the morning.

Transitioning from coffee to smoothies in your morning routine doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your energy boost. With their rich nutrient profile, the ability to keep you hydrated, and numerous health benefits, smoothies offer an effective and delicious alternative to your daily coffee fix. Plus, they bring a world of possibilities, so you can enjoy something new every day!

Next time you're tempted to pour a cup of coffee, consider reaching for a smoothie instead. Your body will thank you!

### Conclusion

Choosing energizing morning smoothies that replace coffee can be a transformative step in enhancing your daily routine. By focusing on delicious and nutritious ingredients, you can experience a natural boost that leaves you feeling vibrant and refreshed. Smoothies provide a fantastic alternative to coffee, offering not only immediate energy but also sustained nutrition throughout the day.

Sorry for bad English, it's not my native language. 


I, M30 met with tow friends F23, let's call her anna and F24(let's call her Cindy). The situation is a little bit tricky, because Anna is into me, but we are officially only friends. I met Anna on an app, and we at first only met for sport. Later on, she  also visited a drawing meet up I regulary visit. (I stopped meeting her for sport, because we started meeting up for things like cooking together at her home and I just got weird vibes and weird behaviour from her). There she also brought her friend with her (Cindy). When the drawing meetings went into winter break, we would be talking about meeting up to continuing drawing together. So we planned when make the first session at a cafe, then at my home  then at Anna's home and then at Cindy's home. Now I want to go into a little bit into Anna's behaviour and her personal life: The more often we met, the more we talked about personal stuff. I learnerd that she comes from a very controlling family, her mother sounds like a spiritual narcissistic control freak and her father is bipolar, on heavy medication and follows a strict daily routine. Which I could emphasize with, because I come from a very neglectful home, grew up without a father and my mother was just neglectful and emotionally abusive. But that's where my worries about her started. I noticed little things which would annoy me about her or irritate me a little bit (I don't know if I am in the wrong here), but sometimes she would act strange, like acting like I wouldn't be there, for example when we sat at the coffee table together, she would stand up, grab a magazine and sit back down again and then just browse through the pages, not counting me in, just only concentrating on the pages for 15 minutes. I sat next to her and felt a little bit stupid. When we met at the coffee for drawing together (this time Cindy was with her ) she would also only sit next to just concentrating on her knitting. When we met another time at the coffee shop (Anna, Cindy and me), I was happy because we would just talk and have a nice conversation, then suddenly I noticed she would feel a little bit uncomfortable and she stood up, grabbed a table top game from the shelf and now we would play this. I know that this are just little things bit it irritates me and I think it's weird. I also noticed that Cindy, although she is a very nice person, completely lacks boundaries and is a strong people pleaser (and I say this as a people pleaser myself). Anna basically invited herself for staying over at her house that. It almost seemed like Cindy wouldn't even consider the option if she really wants that. Anna said something like ""I totally should stay over my your house tonight and the next morning we can watch that film together"". And Cindy just went with her, but she sounded like she wasn't even sure if she really wants that. So today we met at my place for drawing together. Anna arrived at first and we talked a little bit. When I went to get some snacks I saw her connecting her Handy to my Bluetooth box. I hesitated, because I really didn't want to listen to music while drawing. I said something like ""let's wait a little bit with music right now"". I had a stressful day and just wanted to talk for the moment. Then Cindy arrived and we talked for a little bit. Then Anna put the music on. And I was just so annoyed with that. I know it's a total overreaction, but I was suddenly so completely annoyed by her music it made it really hard to enjoying drawing. I really don't like her music taste at all and it just didn't match together with drawing. Songs from Katy Perry , black eyed peas, ed Sheeran and a lot of other music I just don't like. It made me uncomfortable. Then she started singing with it. In an very awkward way. It would just make me uncomfortable. After 30 minutes the box disconnected for a minute. I made a joke, something like ""ah good now my neighbours wont be thinking that I like hearing Katy Perry."" (You can hear it through the door while walking past my apartment.) Then she said ""That's ok, then they know that you also sometimes have friends over."" Which is quite mean when I think about it. It also hit me a little bit, because I actually don't have that much friends. She just smiled and put the music back on. Then i said in a joking, but clearly sarcastic way ""yeah just put it back on"". And from than another hour of her music with her randomly singing now and then. Now even Cindy felt uncomfortable and made slight comments to the music running. I was just in a bad mood from then on. Then she said ""hey why are you having such a bad mood?"" In a slightly mocking way. I just said ""it's alright"". In my head I already made plans on how I just would slowly step out of contact with her in the future, because I was so pissed in that moment. Finally, the 2.5 hours were over and we said goodbye. Now I have the question, am I the asshole for being very annoyed from her behaviour and wanting to back off from our friendship? I know she wants more, but I just don't want to, especially after that behaviour. I know that she is just 23 years old and I am 30, maybe I am a little bit extra annoyed because I was a little bit like her when I was her age. ",1,1738375123.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1ievlap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1ievlap/much_needed_rant_need_feedback/,Much needed rant! Need feedback,"Random rant about my bf texting and meeting his ex gf 

So I'm (34f) sat in bed right now with my head completely messed up. My boyfriend (39m) has been texting and meeting his ex and not telling me.

This is a very long winded story so, my apologies. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and the last year has been a bit of a tough one with working and living together in a stressful environment. We were going to open a shop and had spent a lot of time plumbing, wiring and decorating but to be honest it was tough being around each other all the time. Which is normal for most couples I would say. 

Anyways for the first year of the relationship everything was great and we had a great time together. I completely fell in love with him. He has many, many amazing qualities that I love. He's smart and funny, super driven and kind, just thought he was an all round lovely guy to be be with. We talked about building this amazing life together and we wanted the same things too which was unbelievable because we wouldn't think about things too conventionally. 

He introduced me to friends and family and we all seemed to get along. He was particularly close with one women we'll call Alice and her husband we'll call Nick. I also got on very well with Alice and would meet her the odd time for coffee. My partner would act completely weird when we went for coffee without him, like asking can he go with us constantly before we left and asking what would we be talking about. Alice would tell me that my partner would hate the fact the we were talking without him and she was surprised he didn't come anyway. I always assumed it was because he didn't want to miss out on the craic we would have and all that jazz. 

So like I said before, the last year was super stressful for the both of us and we were having some issues communicating and just generally getting along, there was constant bickering and he would disappear for ages sometimes and then come back with some story about where he has been, like at a distillery with his mate, Will (remember his name). We would come home at night and I'd be in bed by 10 and he would stay up to 3 or 4 in the morning, on his phone most of the time texting, whilst playing games. We lived in an open planned studio so I can see the sofa from my bed so I could see him typing. He was also very secretive with his phone. If we were lying beside each other he would face the phone away from me. Not that I was particularly looking for anything but the angle it was at was very strange and like he was hiding it. We also didnt have sex for almost a year (we both kinda gave up on this for a long time). I had moved to his house, which is about 2 and a half hours from my own, and really the only person I knew that I could just vent to was Alice.  I told her the problems we were having and how I thought he might be texting other people or girls and not wanting me to see and that I was very uncomfortable with it and also abit heartbroken. I should note that Will is Alice's brother.

Just to note I had said to my partner about him constantly being on the phone and that it was weird he wouldn't talk about who he's texting or even telling me how the person is doing it how he knows them. Not that I would  constantly ask either but just for it to be brought up in light conversation. Like 'oh I'm just texting a mate of mine from back in school' or ' a friend he used to hang out with' He just never talked about it. When I asked him about it he had told me there was nothing going on, gave me some names (that I had never heard of before) of the people that he was texting. But I just knew it wasn't true 

So we broke up and I moved back home, so heartbroken. We took a couple of weeks apart but alas, we started to speak again. And we had one of those massive talks were you put your whole heart on the line and put it all on the table. I really went in about his late night messaging and how I thought he was messaging someone else. How he was really private with his past dating history and I never knew any of his ex girlfriends names or what happened in the relationship. And again, not that I would be praying into this but it comes up in conversations with some couples. And I had shared all about my dating history, good or bad, because some stories are funny and some or sad but I wanted him to know me and my experience of life growing up.

Well he tells me that his last girlfriend was Alice and Will's sister, Beth (not her real name). I was like who?? Because I had never heard that name before. Very strange. And he says to me ' sure you know I used to go out with Beth' and I told him, I certainly did not, I didn't even know Will and Alice had a sister called Beth. I knew they had 2 brothers and another sister but I had never met them and none of them were called Beth. 

When he told me I was shocked, but I sort of laughed it off as in ' you dirty dog' kind of way, as in winding him up. And then he tells me that they have been in contact since they broke up and have remained friends. And I asked him 'have you been messaging her for the whole two years we have been seeing each other?' and of course it was yes. He told me that he was really close to all her family and when he calls to see her brother she is always there and they have the craic with each other. They text a lot (most of the week) and he doesn't see the issue because she has a boyfriend and he is dating me. 

I did something I never wanted to do and asked him to show me their messages, the old chestnut of 'if you have nothing to hide, you can show me'. He was hesitant at first but did take his phone out and he starts scrolling back through messages while holding the screen away from me. I told him I can't see what the messages are and to turn the phone around so I could see. Well, when I say this mutha fucka scrolled so fast through those messages I'm surprised his thumb wasn't cramping. I had to stop the screen myself just to get a quick read of some messages. Turns out they have met a few times for coffee and shes took him shopping in a different town for clothes whilst I have Gone home to see my friends and family. And I had absolutely no idea. I just shattered.

Most messages were memes they had sent or something random craic they were having but there were some messages I wasn't happy with at all and the fact that they have met behind my back, just really pissed me off. 

I was supposed to meet Alice for coffee that day (I had asked to see the messages in the morning) and I had to call her when I was driving home to cancel. She could tell I was upset and asked what was wrong. I just told her straight, I know my partner used to date your sister and I know they are still in contact and have met up for coffee behind my back. Alice said that she wasn't sure if my partner had told me about it and didn't want to be the one to tell me their history as it wasn't really her business. I hung up because I was driving and I was too upset to talk.

After a few hours Alice text me to see if I had got home ok and ask how I was feeling and the usual kinda stuff. She told me that yes they had dated for 2 years. Apparently it didn't end the best but somehow they had managed to stay friends. But she assured me that her sister was completely over my partner and I didnt have anything to worry about but he should have told me.

Now I'm not aversed to ex's being friends. I understand this can happen and although I could never be friends with my ex, I know a few people who this has worked out for. Myself personally, would want to be told if me current partner is talking to his ex on a regular basis. And I wasn't. I didn't even know this girl existed until a few days ago. 

And although yes it stings in a way because it's his ex and I might be a bit worried there's some feelings there, it's mostly the fact that he hid the whole thing from me for our whole relationship. He told me stories about a dog that he told me he had bought for Will (which was weird to me but I ignored it) and it turns out he had bought it for her for Christmas... When he would wait until I had gone back to my hometown and then meet her. And I had asked him to come with me every time. But towards the end he always picked a fight with me before leaving so then he had an excuse not to go. He told me he built a disability ramp for Wills mother because he asked him too and my partner was so close to Wills family. I thought it was great. A lovely thing to do, it still is but it wasn't Will that had asked it was Beth. And he had also loaned Beth a substantial amount of money without telling me about a year into our relationship, so she could take some course to become a teacher. Even though she had a boyfriend at this stage too. 

I am realising this rant is longer than I thought and there is more but my fingers are sore from typing and holding my phone. 

If you would like me to continue let me know! But even if I could get some thought from people that mnthe story so far? Like am I an idiot? Do I give him the benefit of the doubt? Any advice lol 

This is a throwaway account as I'm afraid he is on Reddit 🙈 

This has been my TED talk

When we saw each other today she just about gave me a hug. This kind of touching has escalated over the past couple of months. She always laughs a lot at every dumb joke or cocky comment I make and touches me and has her hands all over my arms and shoulders when she laughs. She has that shine in her eyes and smile when she looks at me that seems like she’s interested. Sometimes the conversation drifts towards work stuff though, and that dampens the spark for me, and I wonder if I’ve ruined it when this happens. I need to stop that, or at least inject more humor into it, because it is dull to talk about.

I got her number shortly after I met her late last year and asked her out. She said she would let me know. I didn’t hear back from her then. She has a daughter, two jobs, and studies as well so I assumed she must be too busy. She just had an exam yesterday so I know she has been busy with her studies. We don’t talk much via text and I don’t initiate text conversations - I’d rather just talk in person. I didn’t ask her again until this morning when I saw her before I left to go home and after talking with her for about an hour (I work overnights on Fridays and she works the next morning). She said “for coffee?” and I said “let’s just go and have some fun” (we could do coffee if the vibe is right, but generally going out for coffee is more of a friendship thing). She said she promises to message me this time. I said OK cool, then left.

Do you think she interested in me romantically or as just friends? Is she less interested in me than I think?",1,1738374729.0,bodylanguage,2,1.0,False

Genre: Point and click? It’s mainly one button from what I remember 

Est. Year of release: I’d assume closer to 2014

Graphics/Art style: In the best way I could describe it, it looks like the flash game “One Chance” except it’s in first person. From what I remember it was closer to an 8 bit style where as the game went on would go from a regular normal spring day to a really dark and gloomy setting. When the game was on its final day you would basically be in hell and everything would be red-ish.

Notable characters: When the work day would end you would see this neighbor who would always say something along the lines of “Nice day we’re having” no matter how bad it was outside, and there was another notable character that I would assume is your boss and when youd look up from your desk would say something like “keep up the good work”. When the game was on its final day satan would replace your boss and say the same line.

Notable gameplay mechanics: I’m pretty sure 99% of the game was pressing either Q or E. I remember before you head out to work the game would prompt you to make coffee by pressing E and drinking the coffee by pressing E. When you went to work you’d press Q and E to “type” and when you’d get home you’d check your mailbox (I think) by pressing E. There wasn’t a whole lot of mechanics it was mainly pressing E.

Other: I could almost swear the games name was “Press E to Work” but I can’t find a single thing on it. When you’d type into the computer at your job no matter what you’d write something that had to do with reports. 95% sure markiplier or jacksepticeye played the game. As the day would go on you wouldn’t actually make money so your water would get shut off and when you were prompted to drink the coffee you’d drink straight coffee grounds. On the final day where you’re in hell instead of a computer you would be typing onto a scroll in latin or something. Again, what you pressed didn’t change the words that would pop up onto the scroll/computer. Also, on the last day when you were prompted to make coffee and brush your teeth you’d look out the window and you’d be in hell and the coffee you’d drink were like souls or something of that nature.",1,1738374728.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

This would be the perfect place to hit up during a leisurely weekend walk around the area (Soho has some beautiful architecture). It's basically a bookstore, but better, because they have a great selection of secondhand clothes, accessories, housewares, and a bar! The bar serves beer, wine, premade cocktails (like Tip Top) and coffee. I stopped by at 5:30 ish today and it was very chill. Oh - they also have a great selection of vinyl records.

I got a cappucino for $4-something, two skeins of yarn for $1 each, and a cashmere blazer for $30.

All this AND the proceeds go to a great cause, as Housing Works's mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS. They engage both in advocacy and providing services such as housing, healthcare, meals and nutritional counseling, mental health and substance use treatment, job training, and legal assistance to those in need.

They're open from 11a-8p every day, located at 126 Crosby Street.

She looked to her left and noticed that one of her engineers—Margaret Pointe, one of the new hires—looked tense. She was perched on the edge of her chair, eyes locked on the screen, slumped over her keyboard.
“Margaret, is everything okay?”
Margaret barely looked up. “Yes,” she murmured, giving Eden a tired smile. “I’m just having trouble with this report. I want it to be perfect for my first meeting here at the company.”
Eden studied Margaret carefully.
She looked drained, as if she’d been sitting in front of that screen all night. Judging by the six empty coffee cups cluttering her desk, she probably had.
Eden crossed her arms. “Take the day off. You need to take a breath, recoup, and come back tomorrow.”
Margaret started to protest but quickly reconsidered.
“Thank you, Ms. Frost.”
She quickly gathered her things as Eden stepped into the elevator, ascending to the 50th floor.
“Good morning, Ms. Frost, and congratulations on the new launch!”
Jonah’s usual enthusiasm was in full force.
“I heard that it went exceptionally well—and it should have, given how much time, planning, and mon—”
“Jonah, please.” Eden pinched the bridge of her nose. “You’re rambling again. We’ve talked about this.”
“Yes, yes, we have, Ms. Frost.” Jonah sighed, clearly embarrassed. “I’m sorry.”
He quickly recovered. “But this letter came for you this morning.”
Eden took the envelope, glanced at it briefly, then confidently strode into her office.
She turned the envelope over in her hands.
Blank.
No return address.
That’s strange.
She hesitated but tore it open.
Her stomach tightened as she read the words.
Don’t forget what you did.
For a brief moment, dread pooled in her stomach.
Then—she scoffed.
Just another scare tactic.
She crumpled the letter and tossed it into the trash. “Sparks Enterprises is going to have to do a lot better than that.”
Shaking off the unease, she sat down at her desk and began logging into her computer.
Her phone vibrated.
She glanced at the screen.
Home Security Alert: FRONT DOOR OPEN.
A chill snaked up Eden’s spine.
Part 2
The lump in Eden’s throat rose as she reached for her phone again.
Her fingers trembled as she logged into her home security system.
Her heart plummeted.
There—standing in the middle of her foyer—was a woman.
Tall. Dark hair.
The woman slowly turned toward the camera.
Eden’s breath caught in her throat.
She knew that woman.
She knew that face.
It was her twin sister.
This was bad.
Eden shot up from her chair, pacing her office.
“There’s no way this is happening. It simply isn’t possible.”
Images of the last time she saw her sister flickered through her mind—moments frozen in time.
But her sister was dead.
So how the hell was she standing in her foyer?
Eden rushed back to her desk, frantically refreshing the security footage.
Her stomach twisted.
Her sister was gone.
FOYER CAMERA: CLEAR
KITCHEN: CLEAR
DINING ROOM: CLEAR
LIVING ROOM: CLEAR
HOME OFFICE: CLEAR
ALL BEDROOMS: CLEAR
Eden scrolled through the footage again, and again.
Nothing.
She grabbed her phone, dialing building security.
“Benny—I need you to walk through my house.” Eden’s voice was tight, forced, level.
“Well, sure, Ms. Frost. Is everything okay?”
Her patience snapped.
“WHY ARE YOU ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS? I’M YOUR BOSS! YOU DON’T QUESTION ME!”
Silence.
“Y-Yes, Ms. Frost, right away.”
She slammed the phone down, her pulse hammering in her ears.
The horror clawed at her, but she had to act quickly.
“I worked too hard to get where I am to let her mess this up for me.”
Her mind flashed back—the image burned into her memory.
Her sister, slumped in the driver’s seat of her car.
Lifeless.
Motionless.
A body left to rot.
The doors to her office burst open.
Eden spun around, pulse spiking.
Her mother’s voice cut through the tension.
“Oh, darling, it’s so good to see you!”
Mrs. Frost rushed forward, pulling Eden into the tightest hug she had felt in years.
Eden’s jaw clenched.
“Mom—Dad. It’s… so good to see you.”
“Well, Sweetie, it’s not like you answer our calls very often, and we’ve been dying to see you,” Mr. Frost chimed in, his voice light, casual.
“You’ll always be our little girl, whether you’re thirty-two or ninety-two.”
He and Mrs. Frost laughed.
Eden forced a smile.
“Come out with us for lunch, honey,” her mother continued. “We know you’re busy with the company, but we really do miss you.”
Eden hesitated.
The sincerity in her mother’s voice threw her off balance.
“Of course. I’ll go to lunch with you guys. I miss you both as well.”
She turned, walking toward the coat rack, flashing them a perfect, effortless smile.
But inside—the dreadful feeling in her stomach wouldn’t leave.
Part 3
Eden and her parents pulled up in front of the restaurant.
The Arbor.
Great. Just great.
Of all the days, of all the restaurants in the city, they had to choose this one.
“We thought this would be a great place to spend the day with you,” Mrs. Frost beamed. “Considering that you and Eleanor loved this place when you were younger.”
That name.
Like nails on a chalkboard.
A sharp, searing heat burned in Eden’s chest.
She hated that name.
Every syllable of it.
Her face contorted into a glare before she quickly caught herself.
Instead, she broke.
“I know, Mother. T-this was our favorite.”
Her sobs grew louder, messier—uncontrollable.
She collapsed into her mother’s shoulder. “I-I don’t think I can do this here. There are just too many memories.”
Mrs. Frost rubbed slow, soothing circles on Eden’s back. “I know the anniversary of her death is coming up. This must be a really hard time for you.”
You have no idea.
Mr. Frost’s voice grew low and somber as he wrapped his arms around them.
“We’re sorry, Sweetie. We thought enough time had passed that we could celebrate her memory here. We didn’t mean to upset you.”
Fake grief. The perfect shield.
The perfect cover.
She knew how to play the role.
Eden’s phone buzzed in her coat pocket.
Benny.
She wiped her tears and turned away.
“Mom, Dad, will you excuse me for a moment?”
They nodded.
Eden walked around the corner of the restaurant. The moment she was out of sight, her expression hardened.
“Did you find anything?” she hissed into the phone.
“No, Ms. Frost. Everything looks fine here.”
Eden exhaled a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. “Thank you for checking. And… I’m sorry for my outburst earlier.”
“It’s no problem, Ms. Frost. I understand you’re under a lot of stress running Astra. It’s no big deal.”
Benny. Sweet, oblivious Benny.
A sharp stab of guilt twisted in her stomach, but guilt wouldn’t help her.
“Anyway, I have to go. Thanks for your help.”
She ended the call and walked back to her parents.
“I think I’m ready to go in now.”
She smiled.
The perfect smile.
Eden and her parents walked into the restaurant, leaving her worries behind—for now.
The restaurant was just how she remembered it.
Dim lighting. Soft jazz humming through the air. The warm scent of basil and butter weaving through the space.
The hostess led them to a familiar table by the window.
Her table.
“Your waiter will be with you shortly,” she said, placing menus in front of them before walking away.
Mr. Frost’s voice was soft. “Sweetheart, I think they still have your favorite.”
Eden didn’t hear him.
His voice faded into the background.
I don’t understand how she could have been in my house.
The EMTs confirmed she was dead.
We literally cremated her.
Her mother’s voice cut through the fog.
“Eden, darling, are you alright?”
Eden snapped back to reality.
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine.”
Mrs. Frost smiled. “Well, darling, tell Lucas what you’d like to order.”
Lucas.
Eden’s body stiffened.
He was standing at the head of the table, holding a notepad.
Lucas Calloway. A friend from high school.
A friend of both hers and Eleanor’s.
He was at Eleanor’s funeral but never spoke to her parents.
In fact, he never spoke to Eden again.
Until now.
“What can I get for you, Eleanor—oh, sorry. I mean, Eden, of course.”
Eden’s blood turned to ice.
“I always think about Eleanor in May, especially with her passing on the 21st.”
He smiled, but his eyes were unreadable.
“It must be hard celebrating your birthday alone, especially the day after your sister’s death.”
Eden clenched her jaw tighter and tighter with every word.
Who does this prick think he is?
Her hands twitched beneath the table, but she forced herself to remain still.
Can’t raise suspicion.
Instead, she let her eyes well up.
She turned away from his gaze.
“Yes, it’s extremely difficult, but I’ve been doing my best to pull through.”
She paused, pretending to pull herself together.
“I’ll have the grilled chicken breast with asparagus, carrots, and potatoes, please.”
She forced a tight-lipped smile.
Lucas stared at her for a moment.
Then nodded. “Okay. I’ll put that in right away.”
And then, he walked away.
Ten minutes of forced polite conversation passed before their food arrived.
A different waiter brought out the entrees.
He placed Mr. and Mrs. Frost’s meals in front of them.
Then, Eden’s plate.
Her stomach twisted.
She stared at her food.
Pan-seared trout. Garlic mashed potatoes. Honey-glazed carrots.
Eleanor’s favorite meal.
Her grip on the table tightened.
“Where the hell is Lucas?” she snapped.
The young waiter, barely nineteen, flinched.
“I—I don’t know, ma’am. He left a few minutes ago.”
Eden’s pulse spiked.
“Where’d he go?”
“I don’t know, ma’am.”
The boy swallowed hard. “He might still be in the staff parking lot.”
Eden shoved her chair back.
She was already moving.
She dashed out of the restaurant, her heels clicking against the pavement.
Rounding the building, she sprinted into the staff parking lot.
No Lucas.
No sign of him.
But on the ground—just a few feet away—
A familiar white envelope.
Eden’s breath hitched.
Her hands shook as she slowly reached down, picking it up.
Her entire body trembled uncontrollably.
She anxiously tore it open.
You tell what you did, or I will.

1ievgpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ievgpk/lagom_casa_65cl_review_niche_zero_comparison/,Lagom Casa 65CL review & Niche Zero comparison,"I received my Lagom Casa with 65CL burrs 6 weeks ago directly from Lagom and wanted to share my thoughts so far and how it has compared to my Niche Zero.

**TL;DR**: Best bang-for-buck grinder that does everything pretty well. Selling my Niche as a result.

**Context**: I drink both filter coffee and espresso daily and mostly enjoy medium-to-dark roasts. I currently own or have owned a Lagom P64, Zerno Z1, DF64V, and Niche Zero.

**Price**

I paid $550 total shipped to the US and waited approximately 3 weeks for it to arrive. Note that the price is increasing by $40 on Feb. 18th. Compared to the Niche Zero, which runs for $669 shipped to the US.

**Build, Size and Aesthetics**

The build really impressed me. I was worried about the stability of the stalk, which some early YT reviews said was starting to wobble, but 6 weeks in with daily use and I haven't experienced any issues. The grinder feels very solid and hefty. I love how compact it is. I have a lot of gear on my coffee bar, so the extra space this creates is a big plus. It's not the best-looking grinder IMO but looks are subjective anyway.

**Workflow**

I know the Niche is known as the workflow king, but the Casa definitely outshines it in certain areas. The auto-switch-off is awesome and there's no need for RDT. Those two features alone give it the edge IMO. Speaking of RDT, I would discourage using RDT on the Casa because you could end up with beans stuck under the anti-popcorn disc that you can't reach and push down. The Niche is still easier to dial-in, though. Switching between filter and espresso grind settings on the Casa requires you to make a full rotation, so if you're not keeping track, it's easy to forget what grind setting you're on. That isn't an issue on the Niche where the grind ranges are clearly labelled.

I really like the magnetic grind cup on the Casa; placing it back on the grinder base is very satisfying. That said, the cup on the Niche sits much flusher on a portafilter, so the transfer is clean and easy. With the Casa, the transfer makes a mess, so I changed the way I transfer from cup to portafilter by instead laying my portafilter on the counter with a dosing funnel then dosing the ground beans into it.

**Retention**

Both grinders are nearly identical in retention testing. Using the knocker on the Casa, the retention is consistently <1g.

**Performance**

The Niche grinds slightly faster on espresso setting, but it's not a difference that is significant enough for me to care about. Lagom recommends a cool-down period after 90s of use, so if you're pulling back-to-back shots, this is something to consider.

**Cleaning**

Both grinders are very easy to clean.

**Taste**

Saving the best for last. I'll keep this simple: the Casa has consistently given me a better cup in every single test case I tried, from espresso to filter, from light to dark roasts. All my espresso tests were done on my Decent. Lagom says it was designed for medium to light roasts, so I initially worried about how it'll perform with darker roasts. I'm very impressed with the clarity the Casa brings out with dark roasts that the Niche never could. The added clarity means a little compromise on body, but it's a worthwhile trade-off. The Casa easily outperforms the Niche on lighter roasts and filter.

**Conclusion**

I think the Casa is incredible value for money and hits way above its weight for the price. I'm genuinely surprised it's not getting more attention and hype. I'm going to miss my beloved Niche, but I'm very happy with the Casa and have zero regrets.

At 8:30 my eyes grudgingly come open. 'Why am I awake?' There's nothing I can see or hear that could have caused this. I have the faint sound of my phone ringing way back in the back of my mind. Check phone. My friend has texted and called, ten minutes ago. Still ninety percent asleep I text, 'Hey' 'Hey. VHF.' I'm not moving. I can't even fathom the idea of getting up and going the maybe ten feet over to the VHF. 'Just call me.' My phone is automatically reuping today anyway (Thanks Obama). Phone rings. ""Hey."" ""What're you up to?"" ""Just opened my eyes."" ""Yeah, I kinda figured. I was gonna see if you want to go and look for your dinghy. I want to hit the trial this afternoon, so I'm thinking of coming by now and getting you."" ""You're gonna have to give me fifteen to get my shit together."" ""Cool. I'm leaving in a couple minutes. Do you want to use your big tank on this motor?"" "" Yeah, definitely. See you when you get here.""

'Fuuuuck' 🥱🙂 I force my dead tired body up and out of bed. Wallet, knife, phone, mini cigars, lighter in pockets. Luckily I grabbed a few instant coffee packets at the church yesterday. I bought two for a dollar coffee cups at Dollar General when getting groceries the other day because somebody didn't clean mine out before they left the boat. Cold water in cup. Two instant packets. Into coffee bin for sugar. 'Still all setup in there. Won't that be nice.' Sugar dumped in cup. Stir. Taste. 'Definitely gonna need more of that.' More sugar. sugar sealed and back in bin. Lid on bin. High speed stirring. Taste. 'Good enough. Just like when I was a meat cutter and my coffee used to be cold fifteen minutes after I got it, but worse. Fuck it. Gotta go.'

I go into the drawer my keys and lock are in. On table. Thought I opened two hatches for air flow. My friend is hooking a rope to one of my jib cars. ""Hey man."" ""Hey."" Grab hoody, shades, keys, lock, coffee. Double check pockets. Try to make sure I have what I need. Seems like it. Out into cockpit. Hatch and door closed, latched, and locked. Keys in pocket. Sip coffee. Set coffee on deck.

Propane tank up on deck. Dig around for some ropes I can tie together for towing. Toss in friend's dinghy. He struggles to get his one pound tank off his motor. Finally gets it. There's a cap that switches places depending on what size tank you're using. Cap moved. Hose in stalled. I hand him my tank. He hooks it up as I get in his dinghy. Grab my coffee off the deck. Hoody already in. Engine fires first pull. I unhook us from my boat. Light push. We're off. 

We spent four hours looking for that dinghy. Found the wreck it was supposed to be near. Had binoculars out the whole time. Scanned the shore both down and back. Even went into the river as far as we could to see if the tweaker who said he saw it got it and towed it in there. Ran into said tweaker on the river. I'd never met him. He and my friend talked for a minute. He lamented that he should've grabbed it.

That dinghy, in the shape it was in, was one heavy son of a bitch. It would've been six guys minimum to pick it up, and still you wouldn't have gone far. There's really no easy access to get it on shore and disappeared. Even if there was, dragging that thing would've taken a mule team.

I figure it probably just floated off again when the wind shifted. It's probably enjoying a nice cruise down to the keys. 

End of the day, gotta get a new one.

Got back to the boat around 1:30pm. It was kinda nice hanging out with my friend on a long cruise, but I still feel shitty. I was hacking stuff up all day. I was definitely ready to be back when we hit the boat. Tank on deck. Him, ""I don't think we used much propane."" Me, feeling the weight of the tank, ""Oh we did. The tank was quite a bit heavier. Not bad though."" Hoody on deck. Coffee cup on deck. Me on deck. I wait until he has his motor hooked backed to a little tank and running. We say our goodbyes. ""Thanks man."" ""You're welcome."" He unhooks and heads out.

We probably used five pounds of propane including the third of a pound I might have used last night with the heater. Fifteen pounds lasts me around six months of just cooking. No heater. At $17.99 for the twenty pound refill, I'm more than happy to spend $4.50 to go look for my dinghy with another highly competent sailor.

I unlock the boat. Get back inside. Stuff out of pockets. I'm beat. Lay down. Shoot a text to dude with the work about being sick, not wanting to bring this crud to him, still having to do a couple maintenance things, gonna hang here for a few more days. A little reddit. Out cold.

I woke up after the sun was down. Barely any light left in the sky. Get up. Anchor Light on. Interior lights on. Start this post.

Got a message from dude, 'All good.' Kicked heater on to get the chill out of the boat. I didn't eat all day, and I know I'm not generating body heat correctly. Still kinda miserable so I'm gonna be as comfortable as possible. Powdered jelly donughts from the church/Publix for dinner. 😆

This is a pretty good example of the way things sometimes go living on a boat. You plan the day before to get some things done, and the next day is completely different.

I don't mind at all. I'm happy to have closure on the dinghy. I have plenty of food, smokes, coffee, and water. Music playing in the background. The gentle movement of the boat. The soft sound of water flowing past the hull. Boat stuff can wait another day.",19,1738374393.0,vagabond,4,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1ievdnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/1ievdnn/espresso_manhattan/,Espresso Manhattan,"So I am sure this isn't a radical concept but I enjoy talking about stuff like this because I find it delicious! I've been on a bit of an espresso kick since I got a new espresso machine. I'm also a huge fan of the espresso martini. I find the alcohol tends to cut the bitterness off espresso pretty significantly. Obviously can't use alcohol to cut the bitterness before one goes to work, but as an evening treat or with brunch on the weekend and espresso martini is a helluva nice drink (I've never been a fan of bloody Mary's, just can't do it unfortunately). I love coffee. I love whiskey. Combining whiskey and coffee is nirvana for me. So tonight isn't the first time I've done this but instead of vodka I used bourbon! Using the recipe from the Mr. Coffee bottle:

1oz bourbon (tonight I used eagle rare)
1 oz coffee liqueur (I'm probably going to switch back to kaluaha or bluegrass sundown, but the last time I was at the liquor store Mr coffee was on sale and figured would give it a shot. It's fine, don't get me wrong but meh)
.5 oz of simple (tonight I used 1 pump of Skinny Mocha syrup)
1 shot of espresso (I have been using Peet's major Dickinson blend because I haven't got the gumption to go to a local coffee shop to get some more freshly roasted coffee and it has been more than serviceable for a daily shot)

I find this so much more enjoyable using bourbon over vodka. I am not sure why I don't see this more readily available when espresso martinis are on the menu places (especially when Irish coffee is on the menu). The bourbon adds considerable sweetness and delicious caramel notes. I didn't want to call this an espresso Manhattan because all the recipes I've seen on the interwebs call for Vermouth but this is just a hot swap of bourbon for vodka so not really a martini either but I guess to be fair the espresso martini doesn't have Vermouth either so to hell with it. I digress. Are there any other drinks you all have found that bourbon goes so much harder than the normal/stereotypical booze of a drink? ",0,1738374147.0,whiskey,0,0.33,False

1iev9zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1iev9zy/social_media_is_engineered_to_make_us_miserable_5/,Social media is engineered to make us miserable - 5 hard truths I learned after spiraling down the doomscroll rabbit hole.,"A few months ago, I caught myself lying in bed at 2 a.m., endlessly scrolling through TikTok. My chest felt heavy, my brain foggy, and I was weirdly emotional over a random influencer’s “day in the life.” She woke up in a $300 pajama set, drank some green sludge, and journaled under the glow of her obviously expensive sunrise alarm clock. Meanwhile, my mismatched socks and cold coffee were mocking me from across the room. It wasn’t the first time I felt like my life didn’t measure up, but it was one of those moments where I thought: Is this normal?

I started paying attention to how social media was making me feel—and spoiler, it wasn’t great. I wanted to understand why this endless scroll through highlight reels had such a chokehold on my mental health. So, I started digging, reading studies, and even chatting with friends who felt the same. Here’s what I found:

* **Comparison culture is baked in:** Social media isn’t just showing us people’s best moments—it’s magnifying them. Psychologically, it’s called upward comparison, and it’s almost impossible to avoid. Research shows constant comparisons can tank your self-esteem and leave you chasing impossible standards.
* **We’re addicted to the wrong things:** Ever notice how time disappears when you’re on TikTok or Insta? That’s not an accident. Platforms are designed to keep us hooked using dopamine hits—the same brain chemical that fuels addictions. It’s like being stuck in a casino, except the slot machines are videos of cats and “that girl” routines.
* **It’s rewiring how we think:** Social media is shortening our attention spans and rewiring our brains to crave instant gratification. Ever start a book and give up halfway because it’s “too slow”? Yeah, me too. Turns out, constantly feeding on bite-sized content makes it harder for our brains to focus on anything long-form.

After realizing all this, I knew I needed to break the doomscroll cycle. I didn’t delete my accounts (lol, too real), but I made some changes. One of the best swaps I made? Replacing social media with reading. It was hard at first (like, painfully hard), but now it’s my go-to when I’m bored. Here are five insights I learned from books that changed how I approach social media—and life:

* **you don’t need to be available 24/7** [The Anxious Generation](https://befreed.ai/book/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt) by Jonathan Haidt breaks down how our hyper-connected digital world is reshaping mental health - especially for Gen Z. Haidt dives into how social media is fueling anxiety, distraction, and burnout, offering science-backed ways to reclaim our time and focus. This book felt like a wake-up call, and honestly? A must-read for anyone feeling overwhelmed by the constant noise of the internet.
* **stop trying to “do it all”**[4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://befreed.ai/book/meditations-for-mortals-by-oliver-burkeman) by Oliver Burkeman - Forget productivity hacks - this book will make you rethink your entire approach to time. Burkeman argues that we’re obsessed with cramming more into our days, but the real secret to a fulfilling life is embracing limits and choosing wisely. Perfect for anyone feeling overwhelmed by social media’s pressure to “do more.”
* **perfectionism is a scam**[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://befreed.ai/book/the-gifts-of-imperfection-by-bren-brown) by Brené Brown (a classic!) taught me that striving for perfection isn’t just exhausting - it’s destructive. Brown’s research on shame and vulnerability hits hard, and it’s helped me stop comparing myself to airbrushed lives online. It’s like a warm hug in book form.
* **find joy in “boring” moments**[Stolen Focus](https://befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari) by Johann Hari opened my eyes to how social media is stealing our ability to savor the present. Hari explains how constant distractions are eroding our happiness and gives practical tips for reclaiming our focus. This book made me want to throw my phone into the ocean (but, like, responsibly).
* **life isn’t a competition**[The Courage to Be Disliked ](https://befreed.ai/book/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi)by Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga - This Japanese bestseller flips the script on comparison culture. Inspired by the philosophy of Alfred Adler, it teaches how to let go of the need for approval and live life on your own terms. A must-read if social media has ever made you feel like you’re falling behind.

Now, I’m not saying social media is all bad (cat memes, anyone?). But it’s worth asking yourself: Is it adding value to your life—or quietly draining it? For me, reading has been a way to claw back control and reconnect with what really matters.

If you’ve felt this way too, know you’re not alone. It’s okay to step back, rethink your habits, and give yourself grace. Life’s too short to waste feeling miserable over someone else’s highlight reel. What’s been your experience? Let’s talk.

« Bonsoir, Québec. Parce qu’il semble que tout le monde exige un compte rendu détaillé de la manière dont ma journée s’est déroulée et de la manière dont j’ai servi mon peuple au cours de ces 24 heures.



« Vous vous souvenez de l'extension de la ligne Sheppard dont j'ai brièvement parlé hier ? Eh bien, nous avons décidé de ne pas le faire, donc, euh, pas d'extension pour cette ligne ! Cette réunion a duré toute la matinée, occupant le temps de bon nombre d'entre nous, conservateurs.



« Lors de cette réunion, nous avons parlé du faible potentiel d’achalandage, ce qui est l’une des principales raisons pour lesquelles nous avons rejeté l’idée. La population n’y est pas très dense, il ne serait donc pas logique de consacrer des fonds publics au prolongement d’une ligne qui ne concerne qu’une petite fraction de la population. Cependant, lors de la même réunion, Xelqua et moi avons convenu que, même si nous ne prolongerons pas la ligne Sheppard, elle continuera à travailler dur pour améliorer la congestion à Toronto.



« Dans l'après-midi, je suis sorti prendre un café et j'ai parlé à des gens sympathiques de la façon dont ils se déplacent et des améliorations qui pourraient être apportées. Une chose que j'ai remarquée, c'est que BEAUCOUP de gens ont des problèmes avec les routes. Ils sont criblés de nids-de-poule. C'est pénible de les franchir en voiture. Même si notre chef de parti était occupée aujourd'hui, je lui parlerai dimanche - elle aussi est d'accord que les routes ici ne sont… pas les meilleures.



« J'ai ensuite parlé à mon collègue conservateur, Douglas. C'est une personne formidable ! Je l'aime bien ainsi que son dévouement envers son peuple. Vous devriez voter pour lui comme député lors de l’élection partielle ! Considérez cela comme une approbation formelle. 



« Quoi qu’il en soit, vers 16 heures, je suis retourné à mon bureau. Depuis quatre heures, j'ai discuté avec différents conservateurs des enjeux liés aux transports. Individual Ice et moi avons eu une très longue conversation concernant les embouteillages. Nous avons beaucoup parlé des programmes de partage de vélos et des pistes cyclables, auxquels Xelqua s'est jointe avec enthousiasme et a ajouté ses propres idées. Nous avons décidé tous les trois qu'il fallait faire quelque chose et que les vélos étaient un bon point de départ - en particulier dégager les pistes cyclables. Nous prévoyons d'en discuter avec Polka à une date ultérieure. 



« Donc, j’ai eu une journée assez chargée. Si cela ne vous dérange pas, j’aimerais passer une soirée paisible avec ma femme et mes enfants. Attends, j'ai oublié, je n'ai pas de femme et je n'ai pas d'enfants non plus.

**THE FOLLOWING ENGLISH TRANSLATION WAS MADE FOR ENGLISH SPEAKING FRIENDS**



*Jenin, on this chilly night, appears to talk about his day.*



“Good evening, Quebec. Since it seems as if everyone is demanding a blow-by-blow account of how my day went and how I served my people within these 24 hours.



“Remember the Sheppard line extension I briefly talked about yesterday? Well, we decided against it, so, uh, no extension for that line! That meeting took the entire morning, occupying the time of many of us Conservatives.



“In that meeting, we talked about low ridership potential, which is one of the larger reasons we shot the idea down. The population is not very dense there, so it wouldn’t make sense to spend government funds on extending a line that affects only a small fraction of people. However, in the same meeting, Xelqua and I agreed that, although we will not be extending the Sheppard line, she will continue working hard to improve congestion in Toronto. 



“In the afternoon, I went out for some coffee and talked to some friendly people about how they commute and some improvements that could be made. One thing I noticed was that a LOT of people have problems with the roads. They’re riddled with potholes. They are a pain to drive over. Although our party leader was busy today, I’ll be talking to her on Sunday - she, too, agrees that roads here are… not the best. 



“I then talked to my fellow Conservative, Douglas. He’s a great person! I like him and his dedication to his people. You should vote for him as your MP in the by-election! Consider this a formal endorsement. 



“Anyway, so at about, like, 4, I got back to my office. In the four hours since, I have been talking to various Conservatives about transportation issues. Individual Ice and I had a very lengthy conversation regarding gridlock. We talked a lot about bike-share programs and bike lanes, which Xelqua joined in enthusiastically and added her own ideas. The three of us decided that something NEEDS to be done, and that bikes are a good place to start - particularly clearing bike lanes. We plan on discussing this with Polka at a later date. 



“So, I had a pretty busy day. If you don’t mind, I’d like to have a peaceful evening with my wife and kids. Wait, I forgot, I don’t have a wife, nor do I have kids.”

It’s so hard to put into words. Basically, I’ll be looking forward to speaking to someone and I will want to contribute to the conversation, but it’s as if my brain refuses to process what’s being said and my body refuses to form words. In fact, if I am able to say something it either comes out wrong or it takes sooo much energy from me that I can’t keep the conversation flowing. Then it seems like I am disinterested in the person I’m talking to or like I don’t want to be talking to them but it’s really the opposite. When this happens all my social energy is completely zapped and I leave the conversation feeling frustrated and like I’ve disappointed the other person or made them feel badly and then I feel badly. 

For example: today I got coffee with my mom, she was telling me something interesting in an area I have a lot of interest in. I could barely make my mind focus on what she was saying, I felt like my thoughts kept straying or going blank even though I really wanted to listen to what she was saying. My eyes kept wandering around the room instead of focusing on her. And my head starts to feel a little fuzzy and like I have cotton in my ears. Then I was trying to focus so hard that when it came time for me to say something back all I could manage was that that was “pretty cool” and then I was suddenly physically exhausted. 

It’s almost as if I have some form of “locked in syndrome”

Hello! I'm currently trying to get a civil service job here in NOLA  (I have been here before and on past trips, I have found to enjoy the city, between the weather always being warm, the way the city is alive, the community, the food). and have a few questions regarding some things that I as a possible transplant wouldn't quite know yet.

First things first. I'm a big car/motorcycle guy. what's the scene like out here? Are there meets? events? etc. I've looked around on Facebook and seen that Baton Rouge occasionally has cars and coffee, mor wondering on the ""underground"" side of things. I'm coming from milwaukee and we have a weekly meeting spot and then go do some spirited driving afterwards. anything like that here?

Second. What are decent neighborhoods. I'm not afraid to pick up a second job like most public servants, but also want to try to avoid burnout so not completely sure on what my price point is looking at. rough estimate is no more than 1300 a month.

Third for any FF or EMTs/Medics in NOLA, what do second jobs look like out here? any that NOLA servicemen trend twords? anybody work bith Fire and EMS? is that sort of thing even allowed (ik the schedules might overlap).

It’s been awhile since I made a $Kendu post (6 mos!). But with the recent CTO, I’m feeling more bullish on $Kendu than ever and I felt compelled to share. A couple fellow $Kendu chads recently compiled lists to summarize some of the insanely bullish things going on with $Kendu: 

* Launched on $Eth, building since 11 months, now expanded to SOL and soon to be on BASE
* 17.5k on-chain holders built ORGANICALLY. No paid KOLs/marketing/allocation/distribution
* Community works on their own instead of relying on team/raiders/KOLs/influencers. The community has taken $Kendu’s success into their own hands
* Best ORGANIC reach and engagement across social media platforms like X, Reddit, TikTok, and Threads. $Kendu army is in the trenches everyday
* Unique IRL shilling directly to retail, instead of waiting for retail to come in. Smashing $Kendu content all over the world
* Unique IRL $Kendu brands like energy drinks, coffee, merch, cannabis, jewelry, nightlife, etc to expand awareness of the $Kendu brand
* $Kendu is the second coin EVER (after Pepe) to earn a free Skynet Certik audit via 50k votes
* Over 70% of tokens redistributed since ATH. Perfect distribution from whales to small holders
* Survived three >90% retracements, but kept growing in every other metric (holder count, social engagement, etc). $Kendu army keeps working hard despite price action

Other recent notable accomplishments:

* Base bridge liquidity funded by the community, $Kendu should be available on BASE in February
* $Kendu treasury wallet has become multisig
* Certik KYC near complete
* $Kendu recently shilled at several major crypto events in Dubai
* $Kendu street and $Kendu energy teams collaborating on a MAJOR event sponsorship in March
* $Kendu animation team is working diligently on the next episode
* $Kendu game team is working together diligently on several aspects of the proposed game
* CoinDCX FREE listing and refund of previously provided listing fee in the works
* Shiny new $Kendu website almost ready
* Clarissa York write up coming soon (big crypto influencer on X, with over 2 million followers) ·    
* $Kendu has been advertised TWICE by both u/Coinbase &  u/CoinbaseWallet
* Reinvigorated $Kendu army since CTO / removal of toxic, scamming dev

Memecoin “experts” / KOLs agree that community can make or break a memecoin project. In my nearly 5 years in crypto and memecoins, I’ve never encountered a community quite like $Kendu’s. The $Kendu army is battle-tested, having proven itself as unshakeable and unbreakable. This strength and perseverance will propel $Kendu to billions.

She is never going to come back. We have had a tumultuous relationship full of trauma. Cheating on both parts. Seemingly always end up getting back together. A year ago everything came to a crashing halt. She found out I cheated again. I stopped. 


She never believed me. I spent that year chasing her making things right. Doing everythjng possibly to show her how much I cared for her. It was too late damage done. She spent that year with me, just biding her time until she felt like she was ready to move on. Birthday in October. We go on a road trip. First vacation for me in a year. Semi wonderful trip. I still have no idea she is planning on breaking up with me. December it’s all over. She wants nothing to do with me. 

We spend 50 days apart. The only thing I feel is guilt. I wake up in cold sweats. I sleep very little as every dream is a nightmare of her not being there for me. I’ve been in previous relationships, never one like this. Never has a break up impacted me physically before. The entire time I pray that we can make things work. I realize what I want. To grow up. I want family and children. I want those things with her.



I got into the habit of circling the drain and looking at places online she might be. She had since long blocked me on instagram and socials. I have no way to communicate with her. See her on a fetish website. Message her asking what the fuck is this. She replies. We chat on the phone and despite her being somewhat aggressive and me being overly passive, we agree to get drinks. 


We meet up and i scoop her up swing her around kissing her neck. It’s like I saw an angel. I’ll never forget how at peace I felt. I wanted nothing more for the past couple of months. Obviously it was short lived. The next couple of nights we talk through all the extra curriculars of the relationship gaining further perspective. I apologize profusely. She does the same. Marriage is spoken about. Say we will, that we couldn’t see one another with any one else. The thought of her being with anyone else repulses me, causes nausea. 


After a couple of days of spending the night together, we get coffee and she drops the bombshell that she will be moving to California. My heart sink. Immediately start heaving and shit. It’s too much to bear. I worked through her cheating and me seeing the products of that. I know it’s possible even with the lack of initial trust to rebuild. Not with distance. Fuck. I’m alone. I’m scared. All these thoughts go through my mind. 


I spend the next 5 days curled up in bed. Unable to move or sleep or eat. Going through the paces. Calling out of work. It made me sick. We are no longer in contact. I have obviously reached out to deaf ears. I think sometimes distance does the heart good, but this distance is insidious. Point is to kill any remaining love. 


Now I feel empty. My mom just spoke to me and told me it’s been two months of my suffering that I need to get over it. I cannot help but feel a pit in my stomach. She was everything for me. I am very much independent as a person but I find myself lost at the thought of actually being alone. She’s probably smiling right now. I am alone in the dark. I’m not much of a drinker. I’m going out again tonight with a friend. We are going to get beers. I’ll go through the motion and pretend everything is alright. 


I cannot stand to think of life without her. I didn’t value her, I didn’t appreciate what I had. She’s no angel. She’s vindictive and angry and manipulative but she was so amazingly beautiful. (She’s really not vindictive and manipulative) She really loved me. It’s not all my fault. Maybe 70% is. Dark thoughts creeping in every night. No sleep continues. I force myself to hit the gym. I force myself to eat. I force myself to take care of my responsibilities. I have lucid moments where I’m focused on the present. I get alone and it’s back to spiraling. 


Not really much for me to say other than I’ll miss her forever. There’s a lot for me to unpack and a lot of room for self improvement. At times I wish I never met her and she never met me. I never considered the 6 year relationship a waste of time. So many lessons learned. I vowed to never cheat again. I meant it. I’ve kept my promise. 

I don’t think I will ever love again. I just want to disappear. I hope she is happy where ever she is right now. 


TLDR: Shes going to move to California and live with her best friend. She will date again. She will look someone in the eyes and want to hold them. She will want to be vulnerable with someone else. I fucked around and let my ego get the best of me. I played a massive part in this relationship failing. I take responsibility. I miss her ",1,1738372634.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1ieuv8b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ieuv8b,Knife River Flint Frame,"Knife River Flint is low grade coal composed of plant material which silicified instead of turning into normal coal. The product is a glassy amber/coffee colored highly-knappable rock. It has been utilized for tools since the Paleoindian period. Cody Complex, Folsom and many other cultures utilized this tool stone.  Because if it’s properties as a relatively homogenous, tensile strength, yet the ease of workability and visually appeal was enthralling. They traded this far and wide. With artifacts being found far north into Canada, east to Ohio, south to New Mexico. The main quarry for this rock is found in Dunn Co, ND. If you look at it from a birds eye view it becomes abundantly clear as to the extent of pre-historic activity in the area. (1*) Hafted bison scapula hoes and fire hardened digging sticks would have been used to dig up raw nodules to reduce into spalls & quarry blanks. (2*)
Included in my collection is a small retouched Hopewellian flake blade found in Ross Co, Ohio. (The lighter of the two flake blade in the top left hand corner) From the quarry it traveled over a thousand miles to its location! 
Another distinctive feature of Knife River Flint is its susceptibility to de-silicify if deposited in an Alkaline environment. When it comes to this white patina be careful as there are now some people who have methods of replicating this. Real artifacts will be patinated on both the ridges and depressions of the flake scars not just the depression. I would recommend reading this article if you find it interesting. (3*)

• the first night, we'll catch a guardians game and grab something quick and easy beforehand (not sure fast-casual - but not ""chain"" - restaurants are in that area) 

• day two we'll drive down to the NFL HOF, husband is super excited and I love him so I'll tag along 

• day three: Rock and Roll HOF, Art museum and the market unless that's too much for one day? 

• day three is also our anniversary, so we'd like to go somewhere nice for dinner. So far I've bookmarked Cordelia, Heritage Steak and Whiskey, Amba and Kiln...which one would you choose? 

• day 4 we'll probably skip continental breakfast and go out to brunch before we leave, I've bookmarked Juneberry Table. Will also visit the west side market if we can't fit it into day 2 and maybe the Submarine Memorial, Botanical Gardens or Museum of Natural History 

Other places I have bookmarked so far are coffee shops; Milk and Honey, the Judith and Lekko.

To paint the picture, where I live is an expensive area to live but a terrible place to make money unless you're a landlord or in the leisure industry but it's where I'm from and I love it regardless. Lots of the locals now live in vans or house share as grown ass adults as it's just about impossible to buy somewhere to live on a tradies wage.

10+ years ago I was running a reasonably successful (for a one man operation) repair business from a rented industrial unit and living on a mezzanine level in the same place, pretty much every workshop on every industrial estate in the area has the same setup, it's damn near impossible to set up in business and get on your feet whilst renting both a house and a workshop. It's just become the norm in this part of the country.

Anyways, a new neighbor (friend a)  moves in, nice guy, get along great with him, he ends up dating my bestie, we live nextdoor to each other for a good few years , work away from home together on a regular project for a month of so each year, have keys to each others units etc, we're pretty tight.
He gets a chance to buy a houseboat for cheap and live in a boatyard. Grabs the chance, we all wish him the best and are genuinely stoked for him. 
      Few months later he's struggling to afford the unit and the boatyard and asks if me and friend B can share the unit rent with him.
We agree as we'd love a bit of space to store stuff and do some woodworking projects. 
  Fast forward a few months and the houseboat is now torn apart and most of it is now occupying every inch of the shared workshop preventing us from using it for anything, we kinda just shrug it off and figure that we'd be in that position one day and let him get away with it.
A year or so goes by where we basically pay his rent without being able to use the space,  my friend falls out with a mutual friend of friend B over nothing to do with him and kicks friend B out. Pretty much immediately asked me for more rent or to move someone else in. I tell him I have no horse in the race and to do whatever. New guy moves in, let's call him friend C, he uses it as a bit of storage space but ultimately also can't work there. 
4 years goes by of us sharing the rent. Me and  friend C paying most often by bank transfer but occasionally by cash or if friend A has bought equipment or materials from my business that month, I'd just pay the balance in cash or if it was more than the rent roll it over into next months rent. That was agreed and absolutely fine by both of us. At this point my business had grown, my fiance had come on board, we now ran two businesses from my unit and rented a house together.

A few years ago the landlords of the industrial estate started to gentrify it and turn it into a bougie little office block and retail place, our days were numbered.

I tracked down a property a few miles away where I could relocate our business to. There were two small units included in my rent which I could really do with for my own business but felt bad leaving friend A and friend C behind to inevitably get evicted when the landlords decide their unit would look better as a coffee shop or a butthole bleachers or whatever. So I offered them dirt cheap rent on the other units and we all moved together. 

About that time friend A started making noises about me not paying my rent on his unit in the past.

He'd decided that because there were 10 months where he couldn't find any record of a bank transfer that I must've just not paid him.

I shrugged it off as him being a dick, as he often is.

Anyway, we move to the new place, he gives me 6 months rent in cash (sounds like a lot but I'm basically charging him nothing for his unit) he makes out like he's done me a massive favour and moves in. Along with a boat that I've told him has to be gone in a few months.

A year goes by, I've thrown a years earnings into making the new space how we need it, am the poorest I've ever been, Our annual job away from home has come around. It's a well paid months work we both do every year.
He drives a large van, I ride a motorcycle, he always offers to carry my stuff, I ALWAYS pay his fuel in exchange.
We get there and set up camp, he kicks off at me out of nowhere, tells me im a burden, how i should own a van, how I never pay for fuel etc. 
  The vibe on site was a bit weird for a week or two but whatever, I made other plans for getting my stuff home and got over it.

We get back from working away and I mention that he's a good few months behind in rent and the boat that isn't meant to be there needs to go.  He moves the boat to a different point on the property and ignores the rent.

As of today, he owes 9 months rent, the boat is still on the property and he's avoiding me. 

I could really use the space he's taking up and the rent he owes me would pay all my bills for a month.

He's proven himself to be very capable of conveniently forgetting agreements or just plain making shit up to get out of paying his way. 

 To be honest, i don't trust the guy any more but he's still one of our friend group and kicking him out will be a ball ache and cost me a fortune, not to mention the bullshit he'll undoubtedly spin. I'm kinda just riding it out hoping he'll pay up but knowing he won't.

How do I get my space back or the money he owes me without causing a fight?

Part of me is thinking 'Na fuck him, remember when you paid his rent for years and couldn't use the space then he kicked friend B out for no reason and accused you of not paying your share and now you're giving him dirt cheap rent for his business and he's fucking you over'

Other half of me is saying 'but its your mate, he's a knob sometimes but you knew that, and ultimately it's not that much money in the grand scheme of things, besides, you could do without the drama'

Any input here would be appreciated, preferably some infalliblly sharp solution which makes him realize his errors without me having to fall out with anyone but I'm pretty comfortable with that option as well.",2,1738372155.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

The first time was very bad, but I was able to get pain medication, steroids and barbotage procedure within 5 days.  The second time was in my other shoulder, and it was not nearly as bad.  I had the procedure anyway as a precaution and it was fine.  Then almost exactly 5 years later the original (right) side flared up again.  This time it’s in November, Dr is very busy and not able to get me in for procedure for 3 and a half weeks.  Severe pain for about 11-12 days.  He refused to give me pain meds or steroids, I had to go around him and go to my PCP for both this time but it took about a week to get in.  I was suffering and it felt so inhumane honestly.  I got a little better about a week after procedure (was worse before it got better) and then things halted.  I went back to Dr and he ordered an MRI, but I have new insurance this year and they took forever to approve MRI.  Finally got it this week and it shows a full thickness tear to anterior supraspinatus tendon.  Dr is referring me to a surgeon who I will see in a few weeks.  

I’m frustrated that I’ve been off work since the week before Thanksgiving and we are just now figuring out that I’m going to need surgery.

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

Fellas,

I'm not saying scarabs would fix the entire game, however, at least for me personally the biggest issue out of all of them are towers. Towers feel like CBT but you don't have a choice if you want to participate.

There are number of issues with endgame mapping I believe scarabs would fix.

\-Depression: you don't have to run towers.

\-Being forced to run bad layouts: at the moment you mostly have to run bad maps because you can't afford to waste the good ones on your way to the tower, if you could just put the scarab in with the waystone to force the machanic, you could cut out 90% of bad maps from your mapping while keeping the map variety, you'd probably still have to run some bad maps, but if that's GGG's vision then I'll do it, I'll do it for you Chris.

\-Switching mechanics: as it is, switching from one farming strategy to another feels absolutely awful, each time you want to switch you need to ideally go in a completely different direction so you have access to fresh towers to support it, as if you're cutting out a part of a fucking rain forest to prepare plots for your new coffee bean strands to prevent them from accidentally cross-breeding.

\-Less clutter: due to their nature of having modifiers tablet are not and never will be stackable like scarabs, I understand the many stash tabs have not been ported/created yet, but the current stash tab situation is tragic.

I’m not even too sure what to write here lol. But I’m 28, moved back to my hometown a few months ago, and feeling a little more lonely tonight, so I’d love to just talk to someone fun and nice tonight.

I like photography, cooking, tv shows and movies, day trips, and drawing! 

I used to work in the film industry, but with the strikes I’m currently working in finance. I would love to pursue my passion in product design though. I’m considering going to get my masters in that.

—

Because I have passed ISC2 CC and SSCP, my learning method will prioritize doing a lot of practice tests instead of reading the entire CISSP Official Study Guide (OSG).

The main course I use is ThorTeaches, I bought the Bundle package including the course videos, Easy/Mid test, Hard test and Boson.

I use Luke's course to do practice tests.

On average, it takes me about 2-3 hours/day to review and it takes me more than 10 months to complete all the milestones before I can confidently schedule the exam.

First, I watch Thor's lecture slides, watch the videos and complete the questions in the lecture. For this part, those who already have basic knowledge can go quickly, and you can rest assured that the gaps in your knowledge will be revealed in the tests. Therefore, don't spend too much time the first time having to understand 100% of all the topics in the lecture.

Next, I started doing the practice test, this is the most important part. 
- First, I did the practice test for each domain. 
- A set of Thor questions has 125 questions, after completing a set of questions, the answers will be sent to you via email. 
- Read the answers, check and understand why the answers are wrong and why they are right, understanding right and wrong is the most important thing to understand the CISSP Mindset. 
After completing all the test sets for each domain, I continued to do the Thor test in the Exam Emulation section. The part has a common question bank with the test for each domain. However, the questions of the 8 domains are mixed in the correct ratio according to the ratio of each domain in the real exam. 
I continued the above loop: doing the test, recording the results, understanding the answers. During the test, if I am not confident in explaining any topic, I will use OSG to refer to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. 
Next, I finished reading the CISSP Concise Guide (DestCert) and re-did the Thor Test Easy/Mid. To continue the journey and confidently take the exam, Thor requires you to achieve 80%-85% for Easy/Mid, which is an extremely precise requirement, in my opinion, it is a gold standard to pass the exam. I completed all the Easy/Mid test sets above 85% (each domain must not be below 70%). After completing this milestone, I continued to move on. 

I use LearnZApp to update and supplement the latest concepts of CISSP version 2024. I achieved an average score of over 90% in LearnZApp. When doing the exercises in LearnZApp, I still have to follow the principle: explain the concepts why they are wrong, why they are right, and for places that I am not confident in explaining, use OSG for reference, use ThorTeaches and Concise to see the explanation. 

After completing the above milestones, I can also schedule the exam. However, because I want to pass the first time, I continue to do the practice test with Luke, Thor Hard Test. 

And finally, to be confident that I can pass the exam, the Boson simulation test is something that needs to be conquered. The Boson simulation test above 70% is a milestone that needs to be achieved before entering the exam room. 

Regarding test-taking strategies, I have consulted many sources and there are also quite a few instructional videos on YouTube. However, during the test, you should adjust the time appropriately, do not be like me: completing 136/150 questions and then running out of time. 

I wish everyone who takes the CISSP exam will pass the exam.

Emma sat beneath the lone lamp post at the edge of Washington Square Park, her notebook open to a half-filled page. Words sprawled across the paper in her hurried scrawl, each one etched with the intensity of someone trying to outrun their thoughts.

She glanced up. The lamp’s golden glow pooled at her feet, battling the encroaching dark. Beyond it, the park stretched like a cavern, trees bowing under the weight of the storm. But here, within her little circle of light, she felt safe—untouchable.

Her characters were speaking to her tonight.

“I don’t think you understand,” she whispered to the notebook, her voice barely audible over the rain. “She can’t just *leave*. That’s too easy. Too—” She stopped, her pen hovering.

From the corner of her eye, she saw movement. A figure in the rain, trudging toward her.

“Mind if I sit?” he asked, motioning to the dry patch of bench beside her.

Emma hesitated, clutching her notebook. Strangers weren’t part of her narrative. But he wasn’t exactly a stranger. She’d seen him before—in the coffee shop by the library, at the student union, always with his own notebook in hand. She’d even overheard him ordering tea once, his voice low and gravelly.

“Sure,” she said finally, sliding her bag to the side.

He sat, shaking droplets from his hair like a dog. “Hell of a night to be out, huh?”

She didn’t respond.

His eyes fell on her notebook. “Writing?”

“Yeah.” She closed it instinctively. “Just... ideas.”

He grinned. “Ideas are good. Anything I’d know?”

“No.” Her reply came sharp, but then softened. “Not yet.”

“Fair.” He leaned back, the lamplight catching the curve of his smile. “I’m Eli, by the way.”

“Emma.”

They sat in silence after that, the rain filling the spaces between them.

“You ever think about how this”—he gestured to the park, the city, the world beyond—“is just one version of the story? Like, if we were standing here tomorrow, this would all feel different. Different rain, different light, maybe even different people.”

Emma stared at him. The words echoed something she’d written just hours ago, a monologue for her protagonist. “You’re a writer, aren’t you?”

He laughed. “Is it that obvious?”

“A little.”

“Well, guilty as charged.” He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. “So, what’s your story about?”

She hesitated. Letting someone in felt dangerous, like handing over the keys to a house still under construction. But there was something in his gaze, a quiet understanding.

“It’s about a girl who... can’t leave. She’s stuck in this place, a town where the streets loop endlessly, like a labyrinth. She’s trying to find her way out, but every time she gets close, she—” Emma stopped, unsure how to finish.

“Ends up right back where she started,” Eli said, as if he’d already read it.

She nodded, her throat tightening. “Yeah.”

For the first time that night, Emma felt the rain. It seeped into her shoes, chilled her fingers. She looked at Eli, who was staring at the lamp post, its light flickering slightly.

“Maybe she’s not supposed to leave,” he said. “Maybe the labyrinth isn’t the problem. Maybe it’s her.”

Emma opened her mouth to argue, but the words caught. The thought lingered, taking root.

“Thanks,” she said quietly, unsure if she meant it.

Eli stood, his notebook tucked under one arm. “I’ll see you around, Emma.” He turned and disappeared into the rain, leaving her alone with the lamp post and her story.

And this time, the characters didn’t whisper—they roared.

  
  
  


Emma never noticed the small things about herself until she started writing them down.

She scratched the back of her shoulder when she was nervous—something she must have picked up from somewhere, though she couldn’t remember where. It didn’t make sense. She had no history of skin conditions, no reason for the persistent itch that always flared when she was stuck on a sentence or lost in thought. But still, her fingers would drift there, nails digging lightly against the fabric of her sweater.

It was a quirk, nothing more. Something to keep her hands busy while her mind worked through the tangled threads of her story.

Tonight, though, under the dim light of the Washington Square lamp post, the itch was unbearable.

Her pen hovered above the page, words stalled mid-thought. A steady drizzle blurred the city beyond her little circle of warmth, the hiss of rain on pavement filling the silence. Somewhere in the distance, a car horn bleated—short, sharp, and annoyed.

She scratched absentmindedly, her shoulder burning under her touch.

Maybe it was the pressure of the scene she was trying to write. Her protagonist was trapped in the labyrinth, every street folding in on itself. But something about the way she kept coming back to the same moments, the same conversations, felt… unnatural.

Repetitive.

Emma frowned.

She flipped through the previous pages of her notebook, scanning the words she’d poured onto them over the past few days. Hadn’t she already written a scene where her protagonist stood before a locked door, searching for a key that never seemed to appear?

She shook her head. She was probably just tired.

A gust of wind sent a chill through her, and she pulled her jacket tighter around herself. Across the park, a jogger in a red hoodie passed by. Emma barely paid him any attention until—seconds later—another jogger in a red hoodie rounded the path in the exact same way.

Her pen tapped against the paper.

Strange.

She shifted on the bench, adjusting her posture. When she did, the itching on her shoulder eased, like a switch had been flipped. Her hand fell away, and for a brief moment, a thought surfaced—what am I doing?

But then, just as quickly, it was gone.

She turned back to her notebook, pen poised above the page.

The words would come.

They always did.

  


**Chapter 2: Fractures in the Frame**

The next morning, Emma sat in the coffee shop by the library, the one where she’d first noticed Eli. Her usual corner table was open, and she slid into the seat, her notebook in hand. The rain had cleared, leaving the city damp and shimmering under a pale winter sun.

A half-drunk cappuccino sat on the table beside her notebook, the foam art long dissolved into a swirl of beige. Her pen hovered above the page, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, her mind kept circling Eli’s parting words: *Maybe it’s her.*

She shook her head, forcing her focus back to her story. Her protagonist was lost in the labyrinth again, the streets folding in on themselves like a glitching map. Emma could feel the tension building, the pressure to resolve the scene. Yet, no matter how much she pushed, the solution stayed just out of reach.

The bell above the door jingled, drawing her attention. A woman entered, her movements brisk and practiced, like someone running on autopilot. She wore a blue coat and carried a canvas tote slung over her shoulder. Emma barely registered her as she passed by, heading straight to the counter.

A few minutes later, Emma glanced up from her notebook, startled by the same jingling sound. The same woman walked in again—the blue coat, the tote bag, the same hurried gait.

Emma frowned. Maybe she’d gone out for a phone call or forgotten something in her car. She watched the woman place her order, identical to before, her voice carrying faintly over the low hum of the shop.

It was nothing, Emma told herself. People repeated themselves all the time.

She turned back to her notebook. Her protagonist was now standing before a locked door at the heart of the labyrinth, the key nowhere to be found. Emma tapped her pen against her lips, searching for the right metaphor to describe the oppressive silence pressing down on the girl.

The bell rang again.

Emma’s eyes snapped up. The same woman entered for a third time.

This time, her breath caught. The angle of the light streaming through the window illuminated the woman’s face, and Emma was certain: the exact same tilt of her head, the exact same purse of her lips, the exact same soft mutter as she placed her order.

Emma’s gaze followed her as she moved to the counter, her every step a perfect mirror of the last two times. The barista didn’t seem to notice anything strange, handing over the same drink with the same practiced smile.

Her pulse quickened. She shut her notebook and shoved it into her bag, her cappuccino forgotten.

Stepping outside, the crisp air hit her like a slap. She turned toward Washington Square Park, her feet moving faster than her thoughts.

As she entered the park, the familiar golden glow of the lamp post came into view. She stood under it, her breath fogging in the cold. Around her, the city moved as usual—dog walkers, joggers, and tourists passed by, oblivious.

But Emma’s eyes were sharp now, darting from one detail to the next. She spotted a jogger in a red hoodie loop past her twice in the span of five minutes. A pigeon landed on the bench opposite her, flapping its wings in the exact same sequence each time it hopped.

Her chest tightened.

She flipped open her notebook and scrawled one word: *Simulation.*

The thought felt absurd, yet her gut twisted with certainty. What else could explain the fractures she was seeing?

As the sun began to dip, Emma sat beneath the lamp post, her head bowed over her notebook. The roar of her characters had been replaced by the hum of something else—something bigger, louder, and far more menacing.

For the first time, she wondered if the labyrinth wasn’t just her protagonist’s problem.

What if it was hers?

The recent actions from the U.S. government are bullying our great nation. While all levels of government will undoubtedly be working hard to mitigate the impacts, this is a crucial moment that calls for a full grassroots response to the tariffs—perhaps a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

We need grassroots action across Canada, and it’s essential for Ottawa's citizens—not just the government—the Nation’s Capital to take the lead. I have drawn So so much inspiration from the local warriors in the “**Battle of Billings Bridge**” (reference link needed), and I think it’s time to unite.

While we should all commit to “buy Canadian,” we need to consider more public and media-friendly initiatives. Symbolic actions can be incredibly empowering, especially when we feel pushed around by external a$$holes.

I’d love to hear everyone’s ideas on what actions we could take. One thought is to promote the local coffee company, **Second Cup**, over Starbucks. Imagine a day where we gather a few dozen people to “picket” or redirect Starbucks customers at the Rideau Centre to Second Cup. It could send a powerful message and be both wildly satisfying and empowering. If successful, we could replicate this in other cities!

I’m honestly questioning everything now, and I don’t know if I’m overreacting.

Yesterday, my stepdad had a huge fight with my mom, and in the middle of it, he decided to kick both of us out. My mom packed her things and left without me, telling me to stay home. So for hours, I was stuck in the house alone with my stepdad, who was still angry and kept knocking on my door, asking when I was going to leave. I had nowhere to go, no car, and no way to get out of the situation.

I was panicking, shaking, and had no idea what to do, so I texted my boyfriend. He was clearly worried and kept saying how bad he felt for me, but what really shocked me was his complete lack of action. He never offered to call me, let alone come pick me up or help me figure out a way to get out of there. He just kept saying he hoped I could work it out and suggested I try calling my brother. That was it.

For context, this was his day off. He wasn’t working, wasn’t busy—just sitting at home. He had a car and was fully capable of helping me in some way. But he didn’t.

At one point, I directly asked him how he could just sit there and not offer to help me in any way. His response? He was “scared to death” to get involved because what if my parents called the cops on him for taking me to his place? Like… what? I’ve been over to his house countless times, sometimes for 10+ hours, and my parents have never had an issue with it. I had never even asked to stay over—I just needed to get out for a few hours to calm down and feel safe.

I explained this to him, telling him I wasn’t asking him to interfere in my family’s drama—I just needed help getting out of an unsafe environment. But he doubled down, saying he didn’t want to “put himself or his family in trouble by interfering.”

That’s when it hit me: he was more worried about some hypothetical inconvenience than the fact that I was literally panicking, unsafe, and had nowhere to go. He could’ve easily just picked me up and taken me somewhere neutral—a coffee shop, a park, anywhere—but he didn’t.

His final response was, “I don’t even know what to say… I’m just sorry and I wish there was something I could do to help.” And that pissed me off, because there was something he could do. He just chose not to.

I told him, “I’m sorry for myself too, for thinking I could actually depend on you.” Then I said I didn’t want to talk to him right now. He left me on read and hasn’t responded in over a day.

And now, I can’t stop thinking about how this changes everything. We’ve been together for almost a year, and I really thought he’d have my back if something ever happened to me. This was the first real test of that, and he completely failed. I feel like I can’t trust him now. What happens in the future if I ever need him again? Will he just sit there and do nothing like this time?

I genuinely feel like I want to break up. I always assumed if I married him, I’d be with someone who would support me and protect me when things got hard. But now, I feel like I’m just alone. Am I overreacting? AITA for being this upset?",88,1738370767.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,99,0.97,False
1ieu8zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/isc2/comments/1ieu8zq/sscp_and_cc_before_cissp/,SSCP and CC before CISSP,"# How to get SSCP certification

### 1. For anyone who has never obtained an ISC2 certification, ISC2 CC (Certified in Cybersecurity Certification) is the best place to start.

- 1.1 Register an ISC2 account to become an ISC2 Candidate. You should only use 1 email (your name) to work long-term with ISC2.

- 1.2 ISC2 CC is offering free study and free exams at the link https://www.isc2.org/training/online-self-paced/cc-online-self-paced. The link to get CODE is free of CC exam fees - https://my.isc2.org/s/Candidate-Benefits/1MCC-exam-instructions (you need to complete the ISC2 account registration to be able to access).

- 1.3 It may take you 2 - 4 months to complete the course. However, after finishing the course, you should not register for the exam. I will explain why you should not take the exam immediately after finishing the course.

- 1.4 Some CC study materials that I have compiled when studying CC https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CRM9tWknpLyM7jZgDOk1XmCLbx4xVb3. For me personally, after finishing ISC2 CC, I continued to study ISC2 SSCP and have not taken the ISC2 CC exam. (continued in section 2)

- 1.5 Some personal experiences after studying and taking the ISC2 CC exam:

- ISC2 exam questions often emphasize the candidate's mindset. If candidates memorize the practice exam questions, the risk of failing the exam is very high. Candidates need to clearly understand the concepts, compare, and distinguish the concepts. In a question with 4 answers, in addition to choosing the correct answer, candidates must clearly understand why the remaining 3 answers are wrong.

- If you self-study using https://www.isc2.org/training/online-self-paced/cc-online-self-paced, this amount of knowledge is not enough to pass the ISC2 CC exam. - You can register for additional courses (with fees) to supplement your knowledge: 

- Luke Admed https://www.studynotesandtheory.com/sonic

- Thor Teach https://www.certmike.com/cc/

- Cert Mike https://www.certmike.com/cc/
