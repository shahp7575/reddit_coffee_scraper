1nqh5bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nqh5bk/coffee_grinder_vs_manual_mill_whats_the_difference/,Coffee grinder vs manual mill: what's the difference?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a barista for over 6 years, and I wanted to share my thoughts on something that comes up pretty often - the whole electric coffee grinder versus manual mill debate. Trust me, I've used both extensively, and there's a lot to unpack here.

Let me start by saying that both have their place in the coffee world. I actually keep both types at home because sometimes I'm in different moods or situations. My electric grinder (which I got from here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) is my daily workhorse, especially when I'm rushing in the morning and need my caffeine fix ASAP.

The main differences? Here's what I've learned:

Speed and Effort:
Electric grinders are lightning-fast. You push a button, and boom - ground coffee in seconds. Manual mills require some elbow grease. It's kind of like choosing between a stand mixer and hand-whisking - both work, but one definitely takes more effort.

Noise Levels:
This is where manual mills shine. They're practically silent compared to electric ones. I use my manual mill when my partner's still sleeping or during late-night coffee cravings.

Consistency:
Higher-end electric grinders usually give more consistent grounds. However, quality manual mills can be surprisingly precise. It really depends on your budget and needs.

Portability:
Manual mills win here hands down. They're perfect for camping or travel. No power needed, just your arm strength!

Price Range:
Manual mills are generally cheaper, but there's a huge range in both categories. I've found some great electric grinders (like the ones at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) that offer excellent value for money.

Here's what I recommend:

Go electric if you:
- Make multiple cups daily
- Value convenience
- Don't mind the noise
- Have counter space to spare

Choose manual if you:
- Enjoy the ritual of hand-grinding
- Travel frequently
- Are on a tight budget
- Want something quieter

Honestly, the best choice depends on your lifestyle. I started with a manual mill and eventually added an electric grinder to my setup. Both serve different purposes, and I wouldn't part with either.

The bottom line? Don't let anyone tell you one is definitively better than the other. It's all about what works for your coffee routine. Just make sure whichever you choose, it's good quality - because that's what really matters for great-tasting coffee.

What's your experience with grinders? I'd love to hear what works for you!",1,1758830878.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nqh4mo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqh4mo,Endgame setup with answers to FAQ’s,"Not affiliated, just sharing my setup since I see a lot of the same questions come up here.

I’ve got a 7x7 Lovesoft fill sactional with three storage seats, Stealthtech (8 speakers plus the satellite sub), and a couple of Anytables with drawer kits. I also have a smaller 3x5 setup with two storage seats and a Pillowsac accent chair. Here are my thoughts after living with it all for a while:

Lovesoft vs Firm
I see people say Firm holds up better. I’ve had Lovesoft for a while and it’s been fine. At the end of the day, I think it just comes down to what feels better to you.

Storage Seats
Nice to have. I use two regularly, but the third one tends to get forgotten, so two might be plenty.

Recliner
Really comfortable, but the feel depends on what depth/side you pair it with. Deep angled worked best for me. With a standard back you can feel the edge when you recline, so it’s a little different depending on your setup.

Stealthtech
This one’s always a debate. I came from a big surround system (9.2 with Atmos and dual subs), so I wasn’t expecting the same chest-shaking bass. Still, Stealthtech does a good job when it’s set up right. Switching my TV/box output to Dolby Digital solved most of the audio mix issues. Adding the extra 2 speakers (going from 6 → 8) and having the satellite subs made a big difference.

Anytables
They’re pricey, so I wouldn’t grab them full retail. But with the drawer kits they’re actually really handy. Having two means they work as a coffee table and can tuck back into the couch when I want.

Footsac
Easily one of the most used items. I’ve got two regular ones and a “room for two.” The big one is nice but honestly a standard is plenty for most situations. Built-in foot pocket is great.

Pillowsac Accent Chair
Best chair I’ve owned. Gives you that Sac comfort but in a form that works better as a chair. If you’re on the fence, this one’s worth looking at.

Overall
Yeah, Lovesac is expensive. I’ve been lucky enough to pick up a few pieces discounted or as floor models, and they hold up really well. It feels good knowing I don’t need to think about buying more furniture anytime soon.

Hope this helps anyone weighing different options or setups.",1,1758830833.0,Lovesac,1,1.0,False

1nqh3mk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqh3mk,Finding run clubs is hard... but it doesn't have to be,"We've all been there trying to find run clubs... searching on Reddit or Google for ""run clubs in X"".        

The Reddit posts contain only a fraction of the clubs that exist and if the post is old some of the clubs no longer exist. Blog posts ""12 running clubs in X"" and local websites also have the same issue. They link to the club but often don't provide schedules or locations. Most of us find run clubs through friends, seeing them around town, or randomly finding the Instagram, Strava, or Facebook page.

Searching for run clubs is time consuming and inefficient. We take a search that could be 1-2 minutes and make it into a search that could take an hour or more to find the perfect run club, especially if you live in a bigger city. It's even more difficult to find run clubs when you are traveling.

We need to find run clubs that are close and fit our schedules. We want to find run clubs that match the vibe, energy, and community we are seeking out. Also it's nice to know the distance, average pace, and if the clubs do post run social events like coffee, beers, or food.

I've built an app called Runmates that currently has 4000+ run clubs listed in 380+ cities around the world. The majority of run clubs have event schedules and locations listed. The app allows you to filter by day of the week, time, post run social events, and more. There is still a ton of work to do on the app and it's still in very early stage development. There are many features on the roadmap that will be released in the coming months and years.

Runmates will make a best effort to provide accurate and up to date information but it is not perfect and will never be perfect. You should always double check the club's social media for updates on time, location, last minute changes and verify the club is still active before attending an event. Eventually there will be ways for users and clubs to update club listings and request new clubs to be added to the app.

I'm an Ex-Google software engineer who loves to run and travel. I dreamed of having an app like this during my sabbatical traveling around the world and since I couldn't find anything like it, I decided to build it. I personally used this app during the last month of my travels and attended 18 run clubs in Australia. I felt the pain points of what needs to improved, met so many passionate runners and run club founders, and gained valuable insights into what users and clubs are looking for.

If you are an experienced runner or a beginner looking to discover run clubs, I invite you to download the app, connect here on Reddit, and follow on Instagram for project updates.

**Important Links**  
Instagram [www.instagram.com/runmates\_app](http://www.instagram.com/runmates_app)  
iOS [apps.apple.com/app/id6744839676](http://apps.apple.com/app/id6744839676)  
Android [play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runmatesapp.runmates](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runmatesapp.runmates)

The app is 100% free. I'm not asking for or ever planning on asking for any money for the basic features you see here. I'm looking to give back to the running community and help runners around the world connect, stay active, and make new friends.

Building an app like this takes a significant amount of time, energy and financial resources. Eventually there will be optional premium features that you can choose to pay for if you feel they are worth it. I would prefer to have many users who choose to pay a small amount than have just a handful of users paying a lot.

**How can I get my run club added?**  
At this point in time it's more efficient for our team and process to discover run clubs in bulk than handle individual requests. This slows us down significantly so we kindly ask you to be patient with us and wait until we discover your club. In the future we will create a process for submitting clubs to the app.

**Android Doesn't Look Like iOS or the Screenshots...**  
Building both iOS and Android apps in parallel is time consuming. The technologies that enable speeding that up come with significant downsides when it comes time to build more advanced features, user experiences, and natural feeling UIs. The focus on iOS was a decision made to speed up development and craft the user experience in an iterative way that doesn't require doing each iteration twice. Most of the early adopters and people I've met at run clubs have iOS over Android. Eventually Android will match iOS in most features so please be patient as this app is still in early development.",1,1758830771.0,runmates,0,1.0,False

On January 9, 1999, the group of young women watched the film *A Civil Action* before dining at a nearby restaurant, Lauriol Plaza.

One of the women, twenty-eight-year-old Joyce Chiang, did not have a car, so her friend Kathy offered to give her a ride home. En route, Joyce asked Kathy to stop at a Starbucks. Despite the cold weather, Joyce told Kathy she would walk the remaining four blocks from the coffee shop to her apartment. Kathy tried to persuade Joyce to let her drive her home, insisting it was no problem. Not wanting to put her friend out any more, Joyce assured Kathy she would be fine. Kathy relented and went on her way as Joyce entered the coffee shop. Twenty-six years later, Kathy is still wishing she had been more assertive.

A chilling crime was about to occur on that chilly evening in the nation’s capital. Someone sinister struck shortly after Joyce Chiang exited the Starbucks.

1nqh02n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nqh02n/does_waterdrop_wdc08a_water_filter_perform_well/,Does Waterdrop WD-C08A Water Filter Perform Well? Comprehensive Review for Clean Water,"**A Practical Companion for Cleaner Water**

My recent dive into the world of faucet water filters led me to the Waterdrop WD-C08A Water Filter. Considering its reputation as NSF-certified and compatible with various PUR faucet filtration systems, I was intrigued. This little gadget has been a regular part of my daily routine for weeks now, and honestly, it’s got my attention—positives and negatives included.

**Ease of Installation and Design Details**

The first thing I noticed was how compact and sleek the design felt. At just 9.52 ounces and measuring 5.12""D x 7.68""W x 4.92""H, it fit snugly into my kitchen setup without being obtrusive. Installing it was easier than assembling a LEGO set—not a single tool was needed. The compatibility with nearly all PUR models, like FM-3700 and FM-9500, adds another layer of convenience. I did appreciate the effort to use lead-free and food-grade materials, assuring me of safe water contact. Though, let’s be honest, its silver and white casing doesn't exactly scream ""trendy"" kitchen gadget.

**Smooth Water Flow and Daily Performance**

This water filter promised crisp water flow, and I wasn't disappointed. Using revolutionary technology, it efficiently reduced sediments and impurities without compromising my faucet pressure. My morning coffee tasted remarkably fresher, like I had finally discovered the secret ingredient wasn’t coffee beans, but clean water! While I do prefer a high-pressure water stream, some might find its subtle reduction in flow a minor drawback.

**Advantages**

- Lead-free and NSF-certified materials for health-conscious users.  
- Easy to install with various compatible PUR faucet systems.  
- Ensures fresh-tasting water, improving everyday beverages and meals.  
- Compact and lightweight—fits easily in smaller kitchens.  

**Drawbacks**

- Design aesthetics could be more modern.  
- Minimal but still noticeable pressure reduction under high water usage.

**Does It Live Up to the NSF Claims?**

Testing its abilities to reduce chlorine, taste, and odor, I found it did exactly that. Even with city tap water, usually notorious for its metallic tang, the filter delivered clean, neutral flavor profiles. However, it’s crucial to note this filter does not reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), as stated in the product description. A bit of a letdown if lowering TDS is your main goal, but perfect for someone like me who prioritizes taking out chlorine.

**Strengths in Longevity and Maintenance**

This filter claims to last three months with regular use, and so far, it has held up to that promise. Considering my household of four relies heavily on filtered water for drinking, cooking, and even washing veggies, I’d say it’s a pretty solid performer. However, once you feel the water flow slowing down, it's a gentle—albeit slightly annoying—reminder to get a replacement.

**Rival Products in the Market**

The PUR RF-9999 replacement filters are its closest competition, sharing many similar features. I’ve used PUR replacements in the past, and the key distinction lies in the Waterdrop’s affordability and comparable quality. While the PUR options might slightly edge out in terms of longevity, the WD-C08A offers better value for those on a budget. Brita faucet filters, another alternative, are decent for small households but are noticeably less effective in chlorine reduction compared to this Waterdrop model.

**Affordable Quality at Its Core**

When examining faucet filters, there’s always a question of whether paying extra guarantees significantly better performance. In this case, the Waterdrop filter strikes a stellar balance between performance and cost. It doesn’t include unnecessary frills but nails the essentials—clean water flow, easy installation, and dependable material quality. There are pricier options, sure, but for me, it delivered excellent results without pushing my budget to its limits.

Comment below.","“All you have to do is reject her,” hearing those words leave her mouth had me freezing in my tracks.



I carefully made my way back to the balcony and hid behind a pillar so she wouldn’t see me. She had her hand on his shoulder and I could see him thinking about her offer.



“All you have to do is reject her,” she repeated, “And you will have the position of the future Alpha.”



**FLASHBACK**



The day started like any other. I woke up long before the sun had even thought to rise and I started doing my usual chores. It is an unspoken rule that once the members of the house wake up by 7 a.m. the house has to be perfectly cleaned and breakfast has to be ready.



It took me three months to come up with the perfect time to rise in order to get everything done. I wake up by 3 a.m. and spend the next two hours cleaning the entire house from top to bottom. I also have to be quiet because if my father wakes up then I will be in for a lot of punishment. By the time I am done with the chores, I start breakfast which usually takes around two hours as well.



As always, I was finishing it up when my father walked down the stairs. I instantly rushed to his side with his daily steaming cup of black coffee. He took it from me with a dismissive nod and I quickly assembled his breakfast plate- eggs, bacon and sausages.



I placed them next to him and he didn’t even lift his head from his newspaper to acknowledge my presence. I refused to allow the pain show on my face as I swallowed down my hurt. It is my birthday and he couldn’t even be bothered to say a happy birthday to me.



“Good morning father,” His response was a deep grunt and a hand waving me off. “Did you rest well?”



“Do you not have any work to do Amelia?” his tone was an obvious dismissal.



I didn’t allow the pain phase me as I knew my sister would be up soon so I quickly made her special green juice that she drinks every morning.



I had poured it into her glass when she gracefully came down the stairs. My sister- Brittany- and I are twins although she is older by a few minutes. We look nothing alike though; I have very curly brown hair that is a nightmare to tame and hazel eyes while she has long blond hair and icy blue eyes. She is also tall and slender while I am shorter and have more curves. I have been told I look like our mother who died a few years back but she is a splitting image of our father.



As soon as father saw her, he pulled her into a warm hug and kissed her forehead then wished her happy birthday. He told her how proud of her he was and a stray tear slipped down my lips. I don’t know why he never treats me like her- we are twins after all. What does she have that I don’t?

I started delving into pour-over coffee (mainly V60) at the start of this summer, and I got hooked not because I’m an avid coffee drinker or anything—in fact, quite the opposite. I try to drink the least amount of caffeine daily, but what got me hooked was just the process of making coffee itself. 

I started with just a cheap V60 set that came with a very cheap hand grinder. When I started getting the hang of making V60, I realized that my grinder was holding me back massively, and from what my friend told me, the most important things in making coffee are the coffee beans and the grinder. So I got a really good entry-level hand grinder (Timemore C3 ESP). At first, I was very happy with it, and I felt like it improved my coffee. Now that I had a competent grinder, I felt comfortable trying other techniques—grind sizes, changing other factors like filter paper, type of water, temperature, etc.—and also buying more fresh coffee beans.

But this is where I hit a wall. It feels like no matter what I do, I can’t improve my coffee anymore or achieve the goal I’ve sought from the start, which is getting flavor notes in my coffee. I get really jealous when I hear people saying they get fruity notes or chocolate notes in their coffee, because for me, since I started, the only factor I’ve been able to change is the bitterness/acidity of the coffee and whether it’s heavy or light. 

Sorry for the long post, but I needed to vent a little. Any advice is welcome and appreciated 🙏

I would like to back to a town instead of an Island, and where the world is like Splatoon and Zelda: 3D camera movement. It would be something new than the rolling log effect we have since Wild World.

But not only that, the biggest change I'd like is going back to what Animal Crossing was supposed to be: Community.

While all the freedom of New Horizons was fun at first, it didn't last well enough, and it didn't feel like Animal Crossing anymore, with Dream Islands I saw full of furniture. It felt like an art academy to me. I'd like to go back to the Public Works Projects of New Leaf, where you can still have outside furniture, but at a limit. But with PWP's, you have to put work and effort into it, which can be satisfying.

Fishing and Bug contests in NH are seasonal, whereas in previous installments they were monthly, and I kinda miss that. And other events from Wild World could make a month worthwhile playing. Like, I really miss Bright Nights, where your neighbours houses are fully decorated. Or the sportsfairs from gamecube. I wonder why they removed all of that, since it could litterally fill each month neatly.

A third point is that I miss old favorites like Pelly, Phyllis and Pete. Dodo Airlines were new and fun at first for me, but they kinda lack something, especially how you can send letters. But also, Copper and Booker, or GracieGrace. Those are faces missing in action. But I remember from Wild World and City Folk, that in the beginning you had to work for Tom Nook, and in New Leaf you could work for Brewster. And that is another community aspect I'd like to see: Let me work again and deliver packages for Tom Nook, or make coffee. Find lost stuff and bring it to Copper/Booker, etc. I bet each special villager could have their own unique kind of job where you play part in the town's community. Perhaps it can tell certain stories about those characters.

Lastly, and I'm probably not the only one, but villagers on the island are way too nice and feel dull sometimes. I wish there was a leveling system, whereas they begin in a negative attitude, but the more you spend a friendly time towards a villager, the friendlier they get to you. But also vice versa, if you act like a jerk, they will act like one aswell. I'd somehow would love it if they could call me names.

And one thing that has nothing to do with terms of community persé, but I'd love to have the option to choose between auto save and manual save, since I really do miss Resetti.

1nqgs2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateToReality/comments/1nqgs2b/how_to_afford_to_buy_a_house/,How to Afford to Buy a House,"Buying a home an exciting journey, but let’s be honest, affordability is top of mind for most buyers. Between rising home prices, fluctuating interest rates, and the competitive market, many people wonder if homeownership here is truly within reach. The good news? It is! With the right strategy, financing plan, and mindset, you can make owning a home a reality.

Let’s break down some smart ways to navigate the market and stretch your budget further.

# 1. Saving Strategically 🏦

One of the most effective ways to make homeownership possible is by starting with a solid savings plan. Setting up a **dedicated savings account for your down payment** can keep you on track and less tempted to dip into those funds.

Look for areas where you can trim expenses, such as unused **subscriptions**, frequent dining out, or impulse purchases, and **redirect that money into your housing fund**.

💡 Pro tip: Even small adjustments, like brewing coffee at home or canceling a streaming service, can add up to thousands of dollars in a year.

Some homebuyers also accelerate their savings with windfalls such as **tax refunds, annual bonuses, or family gifts** to give their savings a boost. Another smart move is to set up **automatic transfers** into a savings account right after payday so saving becomes effortless.

👉 Try our [**Mortgage Affordability Calculator**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/mortgage-calculator) to see how much home you can realistically afford. Knowing your target price can help you set a clear savings goal.

For more savings strategies, check out [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s tips](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/buying-a-house/) on preparing financially for homeownership.

# 2. Exploring Loan Options 🏡

Not all mortgages are created equal, and the right loan can make a big difference in how affordable your monthly payment is. Buyers in [Colorado Springs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-springs-CO) often explore [**FHA, VA, and Conventional loans**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary), each with unique benefits depending on your situation.

# FHA Loans (Federal Housing Administration)

Backed by the [Federal Housing Administration](https://www.hud.gov/aboutus/fhahistory), FHA loans are popular with first-time homebuyers because they require a **low down payment (as little as 3.5%)** and more flexible credit score requirements. The trade-off is that buyers pay for **mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)**, which add to the monthly cost. Still, for many buyers, it’s an easier path to getting started.

* **Best for:** First-time buyers or those with lower credit scores.
* **Down payment:** As little as **3.5%**.
* **Credit requirements:** More flexible than other loans.
* **Bonus:** Sellers can contribute toward closing costs.

👉 FHA loans are a great entry point for buyers who don’t have a big down payment saved up. However, they do require mortgage insurance, which adds to your monthly payment.

# VA Loans ([Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/))

Available to eligible veterans, active-duty service members, and some surviving spouses, VA loans are one of the best benefits of military service. They typically require **no down payment and no private mortgage insurance (PMI)**, which can save buyers thousands of dollars upfront and over time. Closing costs are also limited, making VA loans one of the most affordable options for those who qualify.

* **Best for:** Active duty, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses.
* **Down payment:** **0%** required.
* **No private mortgage insurance (PMI).**
* **Competitive interest rates.**

👉 This is hands down one of the best loan programs available. If you qualify, you can purchase a home with no down payment — huge savings in a market where the median home price is above $400,000.

# Conventional Loans

Conventional mortgages are not backed by the government, but they often come with competitive interest rates. Down payments can be as low as **3% for qualified buyers**, although many put down closer to 5–20%. One key benefit is that once you reach 20% equity in your home, you can request to remove **private mortgage insurance (PMI)**, which lowers your monthly payment.

* **Best for:** Buyers with stronger credit and savings.
* **Down payment:** Typically **3–20%** (5% is common).
* **Flexibility:** Great for those who want to avoid long-term mortgage insurance.
* **Bonus:** Stronger offers — sellers often prefer conventional buyers in competitive situations.

👉 While conventional loans can be stricter with credit scores, they’re often the best long-term value because you can avoid or drop PMI once you reach 20% equity.

👉 Use our [**Mortgage Calculator**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/mortgage-calculator) to compare different loan amounts, monthly payment options, and compare how FHA, VA, and Conventional loans stack up for your budget..

# 3. Down Payment Assistance Programs 💰

For many buyers, the biggest hurdle to homeownership isn’t the monthly payment — it’s saving enough for the [**down payment and closing costs**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary). The good news is that there are several assistance programs designed to help. Below are some available for Colorado. Check with a local lender to explore programs in your area.

# Colorado Housing and Finance Authority ([CHFA](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-homebuyer-programs))

CHFA is one of the most widely used programs in Colorado. It offers **down payment and closing cost assistance** in the form of a grant (that doesn’t have to be repaid) or a second loan with favorable terms. Many first-time and repeat buyers qualify based on income and credit.

# Colorado Housing Assistance Corporation ([CHAC](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-homebuyer-programs))

This local program provides **up to 4% of the loan amount** in down payment assistance, which can be a game changer for Colorado Springs buyers. It’s available to both first-time and repeat buyers who meet income and purchase price limits.

# Employer or Profession-Based Programs

Teachers, first responders, and healthcare workers sometimes qualify for **special grants or incentives** through national programs like Homes for Heroes or local credit unions. These can help reduce upfront costs even further.

👉 If you’re curious about whether you qualify, I can connect you with trusted local lenders who are approved to offer these programs. Or visit our [Preferred Partners](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/professional-partners-resources) to explore local lenders.

# 4. Expanding the Search Radius 🗺️

When home prices in the most popular neighborhoods feel out of reach, many buyers find success by **expanding their search to nearby areas**. Sometimes driving just 15–20 minutes outside the city center can open up more affordable options without sacrificing too much convenience.

Here are a few worth considering in the Colorado Springs area:

* [**Fountain**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/fountain-CO) — A growing community just south of Colorado Springs with more affordable single-family homes and new construction. It’s especially popular with military families due to its proximity to [Fort Carson](https://home.army.mil/carson/).
* [**Peyton**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/peyton-CO) **&** [**Falcon**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/falcon-CO) — Located northeast of the city, these areas offer larger lots and newer homes at lower price points compared to central Colorado Springs. They’re a great choice for buyers wanting space and value.
* [**Security-Widefield**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/security-CO) — An established area that often comes with lower home prices while still offering quick access to the city and major highways.
* [**Monument**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/monument-CO) **&** [**Black Forest**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/black-forest-CO) — A little farther out, but buyers often get more land and privacy for the money, which appeals to those who don’t mind a longer commute.

💡 Pro tip: Don’t be afraid to look at homes **slightly above your maximum price range**. In some markets, sellers are accepting offers below asking price or contributing to closing costs. If your budget is **$400,000**, consider looking at homes listed up to **$420,000–$430,000**. You might find a property where the seller is open to negotiation, giving you more options without stretching your wallet too far. This flexibility means a home that seems out of reach might actually fit your budget with the right negotiation.

# 5. Teaming Up 🤝

Buying a home doesn’t always have to be a solo journey. More buyers are **teaming up with friends, family, or even partners who aren’t married** to make homeownership more attainable. Pooling resources can make it easier to qualify for a mortgage, cover the down payment, and share ongoing expenses.

# The Benefits of Co-Buying

* **Higher combined income** may qualify you for a larger loan amount.
* **Shared upfront costs** like the down payment and closing fees.
* **Split monthly expenses** (mortgage, utilities, repairs), easing the financial load.

# Things to Consider

While teaming up can open doors, it’s important to be clear about responsibilities from the start. Who pays what? What happens if one person wants to sell? These questions should be discussed before signing the paperwork.

Many buyers use a **co-ownership agreement** (sometimes called a [tenants-in-common](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/blog/What-is-title-insurance-and-why-do-I-need-it-) agreement) that spells out:

* Percentage of ownership
* How equity will be split if the home is sold
* Who handles maintenance and bills

There are also **co-buying platforms and lenders** that specialize in helping non-traditional buyers structure ownership, making the process more secure and straightforward.

💡 Pro tip: It’s a good idea for each buyer to have their **own real estate attorney review the agreement** before finalizing, to protect everyone’s interests.

# 6. Getting Creative with Income 💼💡

Sometimes boosting your buying power isn’t just about saving more — it’s about **increasing your income**. Many buyers find creative ways to bring in extra money that helps them qualify for a mortgage or comfortably cover their monthly payments.

# Side Hustles and Remote Work

With more flexible job opportunities than ever, buyers often take on side hustles like freelance work, tutoring, rideshare driving, or even seasonal jobs. Even a few hundred extra dollars a month can make a difference when lenders evaluate your debt-to-income ratio.

# Rental Potential

Another strategy is buying a home with **built-in rental income potential**. A property with a basement apartment, garage apartment, or accessory dwelling unit ([ADU](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary)) can provide steady rental income to help offset your mortgage. Lenders may even consider projected rental income when qualifying you for the loan.

# Short-Term Rentals ([Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/) & [VRBO](https://vrbo.com/))

In areas that are popular for tourists and military families, short-term rentals are another way to supplement income. While these require some management, they can bring in higher rental rates than traditional long-term leases. Always check local zoning and [HOA](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary) rules, since short-term rentals aren’t allowed everywhere.

💡 Pro tip: If you’re exploring a home with rental potential, ask your lender whether they’ll count **future rental income** toward your loan application — it could expand your budget.

# 7. Working with a Local Expert 🏘️

When every dollar matters, having the right [real estate agent](https://www.mcgarryhometeam.com/sarah) isn’t just about convenience — it’s about strategy. A local expert in [Colorado Springs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/colorado-springs-CO) can help you **save money, uncover hidden opportunities, and avoid costly mistakes** along the way.

# Finding Homes Before Everyone Else

Experienced agents often know about homes before they hit the market or can identify overlooked listings that other buyers skip past. This gives you a chance to act quickly and potentially get a better deal.

# Negotiating to Your Advantage

A skilled agent can negotiate not just on price but also on terms. That might mean asking the seller to cover [closing costs](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/real-estate-glossary), securing repair credits, or negotiating a lower price if the home has been sitting on the market.

# Connecting You with the Right Lenders & Programs

Local agents work closely with trusted lenders and know which ones offer the best programs, rates, and down payment assistance for your situation. This can be the difference between qualifying for a home or not.

# Avoiding Pitfalls

From appraisal issues to inspection surprises, an agent who understands the market can help you navigate challenges that might otherwise derail your purchase — or cost you thousands.

💡 Pro tip: Ask your agent about homes that have been on the market [**30+ days**](https://mcgarryhometeam.com/search-all-homes-for-sale?_gl=1*16o4mxe*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ3NzYxMzkzMS4xNzU4MTQwMjU2*_ga_BL1P7WDH1P*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_SJ4YWRX3RY*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_50BX6YT24D*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgyMDQzNzI5OTI2*_ga_L655GSM8FD*czE3NTgxNDAyNTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTgxNDAyNTUkajYwJGwwJGgw&condition=%7B%22listingstatus%22%3A%5B%22Active%22%5D%2C%22purchasetype%22%3A%5B%22For%20Sale%22%5D%2C%22daysonsite%22%3A%2230%2C%22%7D&uiConfig=%7B%22daysonsite%22%3A%7B%22advanced%22%3A%22advanced%22%7D%7D&zoom=12&page=1). Sellers in these situations are often more motivated to negotiate, giving you an affordability edge.

# Final Thoughts

Affording a home isn’t about having the biggest budget — it’s about being strategic. By exploring different loan programs, expanding your search area, considering homes slightly above your price point, and tapping into local resources, you can make your dream of homeownership a reality.

✨ Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned homeowner, there are plenty of creative ways to get into the housing market.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Every time I open Reddit I see somebody talking about their mock scores in the 80s or 90s, someone juggling 8-9 hours of studying, giving advice like “just follow my routine” and I’m sitting here like… what planet are you from?

Because here I am, 12th grade humanities, trying to balance my school, CLAT prep, and cosmetology classes, and honestly, nothing is stable right now. My school grades are barely holding up (blame my professors? maybe. blame the Indian education system? also maybe). My college doesn’t work for me. My life is a mess.

And CLAT. HOW are you doing it? I can theoretically sit for 5-6 hours in one go, but actually dragging myself to that point is like trying to move a dead body. How do you motivate yourself when your brain is screaming: go open that textbook, read that newspaper, do those five passages. And what do I do? Scroll endlessly. Mindlessly. Like a zombie.

I try to hit 5-10 passages a day from each section. I score decently. I started studying in July, only recently got into mock tests, and my scores were 70-75 consistently. Then I discovered Legal Edge… and my scores plummeted to 43. I cried a little.

And then there’s Quantitative Aptitude. Oh god. I know it’s “just basic 10th-grade math” but listen math has never been my friend. I scraped through 10th grade because my teacher was generous. Ratio, proportion, percentages, speed and distance, they all laugh at me. I need help. Please.

Also, for the mortals who are actually attending school or college, HOW are you surviving? My schedule is pure chaos. Sleep at 4 am. Wake up at 7. 6 hours of college. 4 hours standing at cosmetology school (paused, don’t worry). Come home, board projects, unfinished notebooks, pending journals, CLAT prep waiting to slap me in the face. Everything is chaos. My brain is like a jumbled Targaryen family tree but worse. And CLAT is constantly screaming in my head. I want to study, I try to study, I cannot.

Some of this is probably the antibiotics I’m on post-surgery. They mess with me big time. But still, not an excuse. I had jaw bone surgery in June in case anyone was curious

So please, anyone who has figured this out: how the hell are you doing it? How do you survive 8-9 hours a day without turning into a crying mess on your desk? How do you tackle Quantitative Aptitude without crying? Share your hacks, your routines, your memes, your prayers—whatever works. Or roast me, I can take it.

I’m officially ranting now. Thanks for surviving this wall of text. You deserve a medal.

Love you all,

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too.

Initially, it was just me and the mayor's son, Noah Prestley. We were the first two members. In the second grade, the two of us hated each other. He pulled my hair during naptime, and I scribbled on his drawings when he wasn’t looking. 

When a dastardly crime hit our class, a milk thief, we reluctantly threw aside our differences and came together to catch the evildoer.

Spoiler alert: it was Jessica S.

After a naptime stakeout, when we were supposed to be asleep, Noah and I caught her red-handed, literally. Jessica’s palms were still stained crimson from arts and crafts. 

Her plan was foolproof: wait until we were all sleeping, and then drink all of our milk.

Noah and I were hailed as heroes.

Well, no.

We actually got in trouble for not sleeping, but our teacher did quietly thank us for catching Jessica before her evil crimes could continue. After the milk incident, Noah Prestley didn’t seem that bad anymore. I didn’t have any friends.

Instead of playing with the other kids, I spent the entirety of recess examining the dirt on the playground for unusual footprints. Jessica S. had been sternly reprimanded for stealing milk. 

But I had a feeling there were still criminals out there, and I would be the one to find and catch them.

Mr. Stevens, the janitor, looked suspicious before lunch. 

I saw him crouched behind a dumpster with his head down. I thought he was pooping, until I saw the small bag in his hands.

Hiding behind a wall, I watched him open it and stare at it for a while before another teacher yelled his name.

I ran away before he could catch me, but I was sure the janitor had run across the playground. 

Studying the dirt in front of me, I was sure the footprint belonged to Mr. Stevens. I had already checked his shoes. 

Mr. Miller, our teacher, asked me to collect everyone’s workbooks from the faculty room. I couldn’t resist.

After an incident involving a faculty member trailing animal poop from outside, all students and teachers had to take off their outdoor shoes and wear indoor ones. The janitor’s outdoor shoes were neatly placed under his desk.

Before I could hesitate, I checked the bottoms of them, memorizing their pattern: swirls and C’s.

Stabbing at the footprints in the dirt, I idly traced the exact same swirly pattern.

“What are you doing, weirdo?”

Noah Prestley knelt next to me, his curious eyes following my fingers as they dug into the dirt. I wanted to trace the footprints with my fingers. Mom told me to keep my dress clean, but it was already filthy, my cheeks smeared with dirt.

I didn’t look up from my clue. Noah was a good sidekick, admittedly, but he did eat all the snacks during our stakeout, and he got distracted easily.

We were almost caught when he freaked out over a moth.

“Investigating crime,” I said, grabbing a stick and tracing the shoe pattern for the hundredth time.

The footprint was too blurry; I could barely see any swirls.

Noah sighed, snatching the stick from me. “You’re doing it wrong,” he grumbled. Before I could speak, he jumped up, prodding the dirt with the stick. “You need to look at the patterns on the shoe, and then see if they match.”

“Whose shoe?” I said, coughing over my panicked tone. He was onto me. “That's what I've been doing!”

The boy’s lip curled into a smile. He was the mayor's son, so I was careful around him. Even when we worked together to catch the milk thief, I kept my distance. 

He folded his arms, giggling. “The janitor’s shoe. I saw you spying on him while he was eating white powder.”

I stepped back. “I wasn't spying.”

Noah followed me, mocking my backing away. Another step, and he was standing on my shoes. “You were too. I saw  you hiding behind the wall before recess. You were *spying* on the janitor.”

*Urgh.* I stuck out my tongue. *Boy cooties.* 

Leaning away from him, I pulled a face. “No I didn't, and you can't prove it.”

“Yes I caaaaan,” he sang. “I can also prove that you were playing with the janitor’s shoes during class time.”

I dropped the stick, stepping on it. 

“You wouldn't.” 

He danced back, laughing. “I would!”

Noah patted his jeans pocket where a phone was nestled inside. He was the only kid allowed a phone in class, due to him getting special treatment for being the mayor's son. The boy had two incriminating videos that would get me in trouble— maybe in even more trouble than the milk thief. The first one was a clear shot of me playing with the janitor’s shoes in the teachers lounge, and the second exposed me in perfect detail, on my tiptoes trying to peer behind the wall. 

Immediately, I tried to grab the phone off of him, but Noah Prestley had an ulterior motive. “I want to help you,” he said, pocketing his phone.

When I could only frown at him in confusion, he lowered himself into the dirt. “Old Man Critter is hiding something,” he murmured, tracing the dirt with his fingers.  Noah lifted his head, peering at me through dark brown curls hanging in his eyes.

His smile was mischievous– definitely not the type I was used to. 

The mayor's son was more interesting than I thought. “So, let's find out what it is.”

“Old Man Critter?” I questioned. 

Noah shrugged. “He looks like a cockroach.”

The mystery white powder was cocaine. 

*Obviously.*

However, to two seven year olds, this so-called *white powder* was a mind controlling substance, or maybe even something that could end the world. 

After all, per Noah’s detective skills, he saw the woman in public, and she was acting a little strange. Noah and I uncovered our janitor's evil plan, after stalking him for weeks, writing our findings in crayon, and staking out his house when we were supposed to be playing in the park. 

I became a regular visitor to the Prestley household, and Noah’s father wasn't as bad as I thought. 

He gave me cookies when I stayed over. 

Look, we were seven years old, so our *findings* weren't exactly concrete. 

But we still managed to uncover the clues leading to catching the janitor. There was a strange woman who met up with him outside the school gates at lunchtime. After some digging, we concluded she was buying the white powder from him. 

We managed to get a picture. Noah told the principal, presenting the evidence, and the janitor was fired for the *possession of foreign substances.* Noah and I were also reprimanded (again) for sticking our noses into business which wasn't ours. 

The adults tried to tell us the white powder was *not* bad, and was in fact candy. My parents were called, and Noah’s father did not look happy to be there, sending Noah scary death-glares across the principal's desk. 

My mother stood up and apologised for my behavior, blaming my imagination on the cartoons I was watching. In front of my Mom, I brought up the argument that a teacher wouldn't be selling *candy* to a woman. I received *the look* in return, but I didn't back down. 

She shook her head stubbornly, refusing to believe we were onto something, gently grabbing my hand and pulling me into my seat.  I was threatened with zero dessert for a week, and no cartoons, which did shut me up eventually. 

There was no way I was missing Saturday morning Adventure Time. The adults seemed to have won this silent battle, and the principal began a speech which was basically, *Children tend to have vivid imaginations, but will grow out of it…*

That was until a bored looking Noah jumped out of his chair and grabbed the seized baggie of white powder, ripping it open, his mouth curling into a grin. “Well, if it's candy, I can eat it, right?”

Following a loud cacophony of, “No!” from the adults who really thought a seven year old was about to down half a pound of cocaine, and my mother almost fainting, our disgruntled parents finally agreed to take our claims seriously. 

The principal searched the janitor’s locker, and sure enough, he pulled out multiple bags of white powder. 

Old Man Critter had an audience of kids and faculty when he was being led away. Noah and I stood at the front. I remember him twisting around, teeth clenched in a manic snarl, saliva dripping down his chin. *“I'll get you! You little brats! I'll fucking find you!”*

That was the day we found our third member. 

I opened my mouth to shout back at him, but my mother was quick to shut me up. 

May Lee, who was standing between me and Noah, nudged me, and then elbowed him hard enough to get a hiss out of the boy. May was half Korean, a tiny girl with orange pigtails who knocked Johnny Summer’s out during reading time for poking her in the face. 

May scared me. She scared Noah too, judging from the fearful look he shot me. I had a vague memory of her pigtails hitting me in the face during recess, and were somehow sharp enough to bruise my eye. May’s gaze trailed our school janitor being violently dragged outside. “Do you two even know how to *catch* bad guys?” 

“Yes.” Noah mumbled under his breath. “Obviously.”

He let out another hiss when she hit him again. 

“Ow!” Noah shoved her back. “Your elbows are pointy!”

“Well, you're not very good,” May teased, “I can help you catch bad guys.”

He snorted. “Oh, yeah? What makes you think *you* can help us?”

May proved herself a few weeks later when we were on our second official case. *Who stole Mrs Johnson’s award winning carrots?* I turned eight years old on the day May officially became part of our gang. We were supposed to be celebrating my birthday in the park, but of course we had work to do. 

Mrs Johnson’s award-winning carrots were still missing, and we were determined to find them. 

After tracking down the missing vegetables to a seedy house at the end of my block, Noah had stupidly decided to check out the inside for himself, leaving me alone with zero help. 

This was the first time I felt genuine fear striking through me, the first time I wanted to run and crawl under my bed. 

The carrot thief was in fact the crazy old woman who screamed at cheese in the store– the one Mom told me to stay away from. 

Using my dad’s ancient binoculars and my mediocre lip reading skills, I watched the crazy lady hold Noah hostage in her kitchen, armed with an old World War 2 grenade she *swore* she would detonate. 

It's not like I could follow him, I was in danger of getting caught too. 

Hiding behind the wall in front of her house, I had a perfect view of her kitchen window, and my friend awkwardly sitting at her table eating cookies. *Had he switched sides!?*

My attention flicked to the chocolate cookie in my friend’s hand, my hands growing clammy around the binoculars. 

Could those cookies be forcing Noah to join the side of evil? 

When Noah pointed toward the window, *right at me*, I ducked, slamming my hand over my mouth, stifling a cry. 

I was so close to proving my Mom right. 

That I *was* putting myself in danger with this investigative hobby, and calling for her help, when no other than May Lee stepped out of the crazy old woman's house, hand in hand with an embarrassed looking Noah. Immediately, I hugged him. Then I hit him. 

“Why did you sell me out, stupid head?!” I yelled. “What did she do to you?”

The boy blinked at me through thick brown hair. “She gave me a cookie.”

“What? But it could be controlling you!”

Noah pushed me away when I tried to check his ears for mind control devices. 

“Stop hitting me, I was telling her I had a friend waiting for me outside,” he grumbled. The boy refused to look at his rescuer, hiding under his hood. “She wanted the carrots to feed her bunny.”

A proud looking May held up the stolen carrots with a grin. “I snuck in the back window.” she shoved Noah with a giggle, “Sorry, what did you say about not needing me, Mr Know It All?”

Noah groaned, his gaze glued to the ground. Noah Prestley was stubborn. “She was like a thousand years old and was feeding her bunny when you attacked her. She didn't even tie me up, and besides,” he stuck out his tongue. “I didn't even need rescuing. She made me cookies and I got to hold Sir Shrooms.”

*“Sir Shrooms?”*

Noah giggled. “Her bunny.”

May folded her arms. “Say thank you, dumb butt.”

“I already said thank you!” Noah’s cheeks were burning bright. “You need to clean your ears!”

“No you didn't, I would have heard you.”

“Thank you.” Noah muttered under his breath. 

The girl snickered. “What did you say, Noah?”

“I said *thank you*!” The boy ducked his head and I couldn't resist a giggle. He still refused to acknowledge being rescued by a girl. “You're still stupid.”

Despite Noah making it clear he did not want another member joining our secret gang, we welcomed May into our group with our ritual, which was a chocolate cupcake and pushing her into the town lake. (I did the same to Noah, and the tradition kind of stuck). May wasn't just valuable  to us for her fighting skills. 

She could *talk* her way out of a situation too. Noah and I got stuck in the principal's private bathroom investigating a small case of a stolen phone from a classmate. Our prime suspect was the principal himself, who had been the last person with it. I was convinced he'd stuffed the phone in his bathroom trash, after accidentally breaking it. We found numbers for phone repairs on his laptop. 

Noah and I were searching the trash when he came back from lunch early. If May wasn't there to interrogate him on his favorite video games, we would have been caught. 

That year, we were rewarded a special *Junior police* award at the Christmas parade for solving the mystery behind the disappearing holiday decorations (a teenage girl, who wanted to ruin Christmas for everyone). I still remember Mom’s scowl in the crowd. 

She really did not like my obsession with finding and bringing Middleview criminals to justice. 

Starting fourth grade, we became a trio of wannabe detectives, and even earned a name for ourselves. The Middleview Three. Mom tried to keep me inside, but by the age of ten, we were getting tip offs from the sheriff's daughter. We found missing cats, tracked down stolen vegetables, and even found a baby.

When our names started to appear in the local gazette, Mom grounded me for two weeks, and Noah’s father threatened to send him to private school. 

May’s mother was strangely supportive, often providing snacks for stake outs, and when Noah cut his knee chasing a run-away dog, stitching him back up, and not telling our parents. We were on our fifth or sixth case when a new kid joined our class halfway through the year. 

I wasn't concentrating, already planning out our stakeout in my notebook. 

It was our first *serious* case. All of the third grade had gotten food poisoning the previous day, and I was already suspicious of the new lunch lady.

I swore she spat in my lunch, and May came down with the stomach flu after eating slimy looking hamburger helper. 

The new kid didn't get my attention until he ignored our teacher’s prompt to tell us three interesting facts about himself, and proudly introduced himself as the *fourth* member of the Middleview Four. 

Noah, who was sitting behind me, kicked my seat, and May threw her workbook at me. They had a habit of resorting to violence when I was daydreaming. 

Lifting my head, I blinked at a private school kid standing in front of the class with far too much confidence, a grin stretched across his mouth. Rich, judging by his actual school uniform and the tinge of a British accent. The kid had dark blonde hair and freckles. 

“My name is Aris Caine,” he announced loudly, “And I want to join The Middleview Four.”

“Middleview *Three*.” Noah corrected with a scoff, when fifteen pairs of eyes turned to us. I turned in my chair to shoot him a warning look. His death glare was typical. “We don't need anyone else,” he said through a pencil lodged between his teeth. The Mayor’s son had grown fiercely protective of our little gang. 

I could already sense his irritation that some random kid was trying to join us.

Our confused teacher ushered the new kid to a seat, but he kept talking. “I was the smartest student in my old school,” Aris folded his arms. “I want to help you with your current case.” the boy cocked his head when I feigned a confused expression. “The food poisoning case?” 

He nodded at my notebook. “I'm not stupid, I know you're already working on it.” Aris strolled over to Noah’s desk and pulled out the boy’s notes from under his workbooks. Noah had been studying the footage we salvaged from the faculty lounge. “You're looking at the wrong piece of footage,” he announced. 

“If you let me join, I'll lead you to the culprit.” he stabbed at Noah’s notes. “Not bad. But you're missing something.”

Noah leaned back on his chair. “Like *what*, new kid?”

Aris knew he had an audience of intrigued eyes. I think that thrilled him. 

“You've been searching in the place most likely to have clues,” he murmured, “Which is the scene of the crime.”  

Aris was right. 

We were going crazy trying to find anything incriminating in the cafeteria– but all we had found was old custard and a scary amount of recycled pasta. Aris prodded at Noah’s notes again. “Why not look in the place *least* likely to hold a clue? You might be surprised.”

Something in Noah’s expression lit up, his eyes widening. “The teachers lounge,” he said, just as the thought crossed my mind, May audibly gasping. 

“Mr Caine,” Mrs Jacobs was red faced. She had already seized several of our phones, and some earphones Noah had been using to listen to a potential culprit on a missing cat case. “Please take your seat and stop talking about things that do not concern *children*.”

She put way too much emphasis on the latter word. 

I felt like telling her we were *ten* years old, not six. But that counted as talking back– and my Mom would be informed. So, I kept my mouth shut.

Noah, however, suffered from the *doesn't think before he speaks* disease. 

“Well, maybe if the cops actually did their jobs,” he spoke up, “a group of *children* wouldn't have to help them.”

“Mr Prestley–” 

“You know I'm right, Mrs Jacobs,” he said, with that innocent and yet mocking tone. “We put our old janitor in jail when we were in the second grade,” he laughed, and the rest of the class joined in. “It's not *our* fault the sheriff is totally incompetitant at his job.”

The laughs grew louder, but this time the class were laughing *at* him, not with him. 

Mrs Jacobs pursed her lips, her hands going to her hips. “I believe the word you are trying to say is *incompetent*, which makes sense because you are failing at basic English."" 

""Perhaps if you focus on actual school work and not your juvenile Scooby Doo fantasies, you might be able to speak basic words.” The teacher’s eyes were far too bright to be mocking a ten year old. 

Twisting around in my chair, Noah’s gaze was burning into his desk. The teacher’s attention turned to Aris, who was frowning at Noah. 

Not with sympathy or pity. No, he was disappointed that a member of the famous Middleview Three, who were known to go against adults, had backed down to a teacher with no snarky remark. 

“Aris Caine.” Mrs Jacobs raised her voice. “Sit down.”

Aris slumped into his seat and pretended to zip his lips, before leaning over my desk and dropping a memory drive into my pencil case. “*Here* is the real footage,” he murmured, shooting Noah a grin. “Thank me later.”

“We’re not going to thank you, because we don't *know* you,” Noah spat back. 

However, the footage the new kid provided was just what we needed, the puzzle piece that put everything together. We were right.

The new lunch lady had rushed into the office before lunch time, grabbed a vial of *something* from her bag, and disappeared back through the door. We had been too busy studying the camera footage from the kitchen, to realise our clue was in fact inside the teachers lounge. 

When the four of us stepped into our principals office, he regarded us with a scowl. I wasn't a stranger to his office. I had even picked my own seat, the fluffy beanbag near the door. The Middleview Three were in his office every week. 

Usually for breaking into classrooms and the time Noah tried to jump into the vent because he saw it on TV. Principal Maine was drinking something that definitely wasn't coffee or water. His desk was an avalanche of paper, and I swore I could already see steam coming out of his ears. 

“You three.” The man leaned forward, raising his brow at Aris, who looked way too comfortable at a school he had just joined. “And you've dragged the new kid into your antics! I can't say I'm surprised when I've been on the phone with four separate reporters who want details on this *Middleview Three* garbage.”

Noah’s eyes lit up. “Wait, really? What did you tell them?”

Principal Maine’s eyebrows twitched. “I told them the truth,” he leaned back in his chair. This guy had some serious stress-lines. 

“You are three stubborn children with zero respect for authority, who have broken multiple rules and are *very* close to acquiring criminal records before reaching the age of eleven. Which, might I say, is a first! The youngest person in this town to get a criminal record was Ellie Daley, back in the 80’s. She was thirteen years old.”

“We haven't broken any rules,” May said, “We’ve been catching bad people.”

The man’s lip curled. “We have a full force of officers whose jobs are to find bad people,” he said. 

“Middleview does not need the protection of three children who are barely old enough to know right from wrong,” his eyes found Noah. He was always the punching bag for our teachers, and I never understood why.

Like there was this on-going joke between the adults to point fun at him. 

“Or left from right for that matter! Mr Prestley has demonstrated that several times. Which is why you are in school, why you three should be learning, instead of playing Sherlock Holmes.”

He shook his head. “Get on with it. Why are you here this time?”

I hated our principal’s condescending tone. He was angry. But I didn't think he'd be *this* angry. “Go on!” he urged us. “What did you *solve* this time?”

Principal Maine inclined his head. “Let me guess,” he said. “You've found the Zodiac killer. Well, that's quite the achievement.”

Noah opened his mouth to speak, and the man’s expression darkened. “Choose your next words very carefully, Mr Prestley. Your father may be able to cover up your detective games but I will happily lose my job over suspending you from this school.”

Noah’s eyes widened. “But that's not–”

“One more word.” Maine said, emphasising his threat by picking up his phone, like he was about to make important phone calls. My mom did that too when I refused to shower, or didn't eat my broccoli. “Do not test me.”

The new kid surprised us by stepping forward, the flash drive clutched in his fist. 

“It wasn't them, Principal Maine, it was me.” he placed the evidence on the desk. Aris was a good actor. 

He was playing the innocent kid pretty well, I almost believed him. Until he winked at us. 

“I went to the Middleview– I mean, to these three because I didn't want to come and see you alone because I'm scared she'll poison me too.” Aris dramatised a sob, and in the corner of my eye, Noah’s eyes rolled to the back of his head. 

May, however, was entranced, her eyes wide. The performance was award worthy. The shaking hands, the slight stutter in his words that was subtle enough to be noticeable– but not enough to be faking it.

Aris Caine was already our fourth member, and all of us knew it.

Principal Maine took the flash drive, a frown creasing his expression. He inserted it into his laptop, and just from studying his expression as he watched the footage, widening eyes and slightly parted lips that were definitely stifling bad words— I knew we had him.

Aris made sure to give a commentary, which wasn't necessary, but I did enjoy the look on our principal’s shell-shocked face. 

“That's the new lunch lady,” Aris pointed out. He started to lean over to prod the screen, but seeing the visible veins pulsing in our principal's forehead, the three of us dragged him back. Aris stumbled, and we tightened our grip. 

I was already smiling, and even Noah was trying to hide a grin. This kid was definitely a member of the Middleview Three. “I haven't met her. But as you can see, she is putting something into the third grader’s food.”

“Poison,” May nodded. “Or, according to the police report–”

Maine went deathly pale. 

“Salmon Ella.” Noah finished with a smirk. 

The man didn't react. 

But he did shut his laptop and excuse himself, immediately calling the cops. 

I was grounded again after the food poisoning case. Worse still, I got sick for two weeks and was bedridden, so I missed out on two cases involving stolen birthday decorations. Noah was insistent that the new kid was *not* joining us. I received a multitude of texts cramming up my Mom’s notifications. She ended up muting him.

*Hes NOT joynjng* 

*I don't cre now smart he is I don't like him and Im teknicly the first member*

*May is being stoopid we can talk when your better get well soon OK???*

Two weeks later, I stepped into class, and Noah had taken the seat next to Aris, the two of them enveloped in the mountain of pokémon cars on Aris’s desk. May was trying to play, but apparently she needed Pokémon cards to join. When I questioned them, Noah looked up with a grin. “Aris is cool now!”

His announcement stapled our fourth member. 

Entering teenagehood made me realise Middleview was not a good town–and its people had masks. Even the ones I thought I knew. At twelve years old, we hunted down a child killer, a sadistic man who turned his victims into angels. 

It didn't take us long to realise the people we put away as little kids wanted revenge. And in their heads we were old enough to receive proper punishment. 

Mom told me we would regret our so-called fame as the town's junior detectives, and I thought she was wrong. 

I had spent my childhood chasing bad guys, so I was sure I could catch the *real* bad ones too. I was fourteen when we ran into our first real criminal who specifically wanted us. Danny Budge was the reason why Noah started going to therapy at fourteen, and why Aris refused to go near the edge of town. 

May had taken time off to go see her family abroad, and I was put under house arrest. Seven year old Maisie Eaton had disappeared from her yard, and after searching for her for two nights, alongside the police who had learned to tolerate us working with them, we found her tied up inside an old barn.

Sitting cross legged on a pile of hay, was Maisie. 

Awake. I could see her eyes were wide. 

But she wasn't moving or struggling, it didn't make sense to me. 

“Wait,” I nudged May. “She's not moving.”

Aris rushed forward to untie the little girl, only to trip on a wire, which was connected to a Final Destination style contraption. Aris lifted his head, pointing above him. One more step, and he would have sent a sharpened spear directly through the little girl’s head. 

“Fuck!” Aris hissed, already freaking out. He was frozen. “What do I do?!”

“Stay calm,” Noah said from my side, the rest of us hiding behind an old car. The mayor's son had become our unofficial leader. Ever since hitting puberty, he was now our brawn alongside May. Noah jumped forward, watching for trip wires. 

“I'll save the kid. May! You help Aris.” before I could get a word in, he was dragging me to my feet. “Marin, you're with me.”

I nodded, stumbling in the dark, keeping my flashlight beam on the ground. 

“You know what this means, don't you?” Noah said in heavy breaths, his fingers wrapped around my arm. “Maisie was innocent. There was no motive. She was just a distraction.” Noah let out a hiss. “Or even a lure.”

I did. But I didn't want to say it out loud, because then my Mom would be right, and I was admitting that there were multiple people trying to kill us. 

Luckily, we saved Maisie. Her kidnapper, Danny Budge turned himself in with no word or explanation. 

Later, we would find out he was related to our elementary school janitor. 

The little girl was taken back to her mother, and the four of us stayed behind, peering up at the murder contraption specifically made to butcher us. Aris nudged me, and I almost jumped out of my skin. “You should probably keep this… quiet,” he said in a breath, his gaze glued to the long rope expertly tied to the ceiling. 

“From your mother,” May added softly. 
She squeezed my hand. “Your Mom will kill us before they do.”

“We’re going to fucking die,” Noah said in a sing-song. “And I'm not even sixteen.”

He was right. 

One year later, our most gruesome and horrific case hit us like a wave of ice water, and I admitted we were just four kids completely out of our depth. 

Three townspeople had been found murdered in piles of bloody string. 

The photos from the scene made me sick, and I was still recovering from our old janitor’s measly attempt at punishing us for *ruining his life*. We were stupidly blindsided by the string murders, and thought we were following a clue. 

The next thing I knew, I was tied up back to back with Aris in my old janitor’s basement while he caressed my cheek with a knife. “Am I supposed to be here?” Aris whispered, struggling in his restraints. “Did he just call me *Noah*?”

I knocked my head against his. “Don't tell him that! Idiot. What if he kills you?”

Funnily enough, Aris was right. Old Man Critter had mistaken Aris for Noah. 

The two of them were sandy blonde and reddish brown, one built like a brick wall while the other more wiry. However, to an old man with debilitating sight, I guess I could see it. Maybe if I squinted. 

So, after an hour or two of empty threats and knife play, Noah and May came to our rescue, tailed by the police, and… my mother. 

I think I would have rather been tied up with Old Man Critter than face her wrath. 

I was *supposed* to be at the library studying. 

I shot Noah a death glare, and he offered a pitiful, almost puppy-like frown: *Sorry!* he mouthed. *She made us tell her!*. 

Fast forward to when the others *really* needed me to investigate the string murders, and I was stuck inside. 

Mom had gone as far as taping up my windows to make sure I didn't sneak out. I think me being *kind of kidnapped, but not really* by Old Man Critter, really set her into panic mode. I did tell her that he didn't hurt us at all, and just wanted to scare us. But Mom was past angry. 

She was impossible to talk to. 

May texted me halfway into a horror movie I was forcing myself to watch that another body had been found. Turning on the local news, she was right. This time it was a kid. 

May told me to get my ass out of the house. 

I knew where Mom hid the door keys, so at midnight when I knew she was sleeping, I snuck out and rode my bike to the rendezvous we had agreed to meet. 

May was already there, a flashlight in her mouth, fingers wrapped around her handlebars. 

“The boys?” I whispered, joining her. 

“They're already there,” she said through a mouthful of flashlight. “Let's go!”

Aris was 99.9% sure we would find a clue inside the old string factory, so that's where we headed. Noah and Aris were already waiting outside, armed with flashlights. The two of them were quieter than normal. They didn't greet me or tease my absence from the gang. 

“Okay, so here's what we're going to do,” Noah announced.

His voice swam in and out of my mind when I tipped my head back, drinking in the foreboding building in front of us. 

A shiver crept its way down my spine, and suddenly I felt sick to my stomach, like something had come apart in my mind. I stumbled back, but something pulled me forwards, my mouth filling with phantom bugs skittering on my tongue. 

*I really didn't want to go in there…*

I could sense my body was moving, but I wasn't the one in control. Looking up, there was something *there* at the corner of my eye. It was above me and around me, everywhere, sliced in between everything. But I couldn't look. 

I couldn't look.

I wasn't allowed to *look*. 

“Marin?” Noah twisted around to me, and his face caught in the dull light of the moon. “Hey, are you coming?”

Blinking rapidly, I nodded, despite seeing it with Noah too. 

I couldn't look. 

I wasn't allowed. 

*“Dude, are you good?”*

My vision was blurring, and a scream was clawing its way up my throat. I took a step back, my eyes following his every movement. “Noah.” I didn't realise his name was slipping from my lips, a rooted fear I didn't understand setting my body into fight or flight. 

*Why…* 

I choked back tears. *Why do you look… like that?*

I held out my own hands, hot tears filling my eyes. 

I looked up into the sky, at criss-crosses that didn't make sense. 

*“Yeah, I'm coming!”* my mouth moved for me, and I joined the others, pushing open the large wooden door. 

I didn't remember anything past the old wooden door we pushed through. Going back to that memory over and over again, all I remembered was pushing the door. 

I was found three hours later, inconsolable, screaming on the side of the road, my fingers entangled with…string. It was everywhere. Mom said I blocked out a lot, but I strictly remember blood slicked string covering me, damp in my hands and tangled in my hair. 

There was no sign of the others. 

Mom put me into the back of her car, and I slept for a while. My mother drove us far away from Middleview. I asked about my friends, but Mom told me they weren't real, that Middleview was a fantasy I had dreamed up as a child. She told me I was in a *traumatising incident* as a child, and mixed up reality and fiction.

*Cartoons and my own life.*

But they *were* real. 

No amount of private therapists spewing the same shit could erase my whole life. 

I was strictly told that I had a head injury, that I imagined The Middleview Four like my own personal fantasy. I didn't start believing it until I grew into an adult and was prescribed some pretty strong meds, so I began to wonder if they were in fact delusions. 

Mom’s job was a mystery I couldn't solve, even as a twenty three year old. 

So, I followed her one night, hopping into my car when she left our driveway. 

Her job was behind a ten foot wall surrounded by barriers.

Security guards were checking a car in, so I took my chance, and slipped through on-foot. What I saw behind the barrier was Middleview. 

The town I thought I hallucinated. 

I was immediately blinded by flood lights illuminating the diner from my childhood. *Middleview.* I took a shaky step forward, my stomach twisting. 

It was a TV set.

No, more of a *stage*.

Inside, bathed in the pretty colours I remembered from my childhood, were my friends sitting in our usual booth, frozen at fifteen years old. The Middleview Four, minus me, were exactly the same as when I left them. 

They were even wearing the same clothes. 

May. Her orange pigtails bobbed along with her head. Aris was hunched over like usual, picking at his fries and dipping them in his shake. *Except how could I take any of this seriously when they were surrounded by cameras?*

Noah slammed his hands down on the table with a triumphant grin. “We are *so* close to cracking this case!”

I noticed his lips weren't moving with his voice. 

I started toward them slowly, even when the truth dangled above me, below me, everywhere. I stepped over it, blew it out of my face, reaching shaky hands forward to pull them aside. 

Aris laughed, and something *moved* above him. 

“We were kidnapped last week. We are not close. You're just *painfully* optimistic.”

May nudged him, giggling. “Let him have this. He thinks he's our leader.”

Noah punched the air, and there it was again. Movement. “I *am* our leader!”

*Closer.*

I found myself inches away from my best friend, and my blood ran so cold, so painful, poison in my veins. Noah stood up, and I could see the reality of him in front of me. The reality of want I wasn't allowed to see.

His head wobbled slightly when he smiled, mouth opening and closing in jerking motions. If I looked closer, his lips had been split apart to perfectly replicate a smile. I forced myself to take all of him in. All of Aris, and May. 

The back of Noah had been hollowed out, a startling red cavern where his spine was supposed to be, where flesh and bone was supposed to be. Now, I just saw… strings. Looking closer, I could finally *see* them. Strings tangled around his  arms, his legs, puppeteering his every move as he danced from string to string. 

I grabbed Noah’s hand, and it was ice cold, slimy flesh that was long dead. 

He didn't move, but his eyes somehow found me. Noah’s expression flickered with recognition, before his strings were tugged violently, and he screamed, his eyes going wide, lips twisting. 

“Marin?” His artificial eyes blinked, and he slowly moved his head. 

“You… left… us.”

Noah’s lips curled, a deep throated whine escaping his throat. “You… left us!”

He twisted around, his lip wobbling. 

“Why?!” his frightened eyes flicked from me to his own hands. All those inside jokes our teachers had, I thought dizzily. Was this what it was for? Was Noah Prestley nothing but comedic relief? 

“Why… am I… cold?” Noah mumbled.

“Cut!” someone yelled. 

I staggered back, words tangled in my throat. Noah opened his mouth, but he was pulled back, this time violently, his strings above jerking, tangling together. 

“Allison!” a man shouted from behind me. “Why is your daughter on the stage? Get her out of here!”

I was paralysed, still staring at the hollowed out *puppet* who had been my best friend, when my mother’s arms wrapped around me so tight, I lost the ability to breathe. I was still staring at the strings cross crossed above me, Noah’s strings pulling him back. Aris’s strings forcing him to laugh. May’s strings bobbing her head in a nodding gesture. 

“Marin,” Mom whispered into my back. “You cannot be here.”

“They're here,” was all I managed to whisper. 

Her sobs shook against me. I didn't realise my mother was crying until I felt her tears wet on my shoulder. The words were entangled on my tongue, but just like the string above me, they were knotted and contorted. 

*They were here. All this time they were here, and you made me think I was crazy?!*

*What did you do to them?*

*What did you DO?*

“No, sweetie. No, they're not.” Mom’s voice was breaking, her grip tightening around me. The world was spinning and I was barely aware of myself kicking and screaming while my Mom struggled to shout over me. “I was going to expose them to the world,” she hissed out, dragging me away from Noah– away from his jerking, puppet-like mouth. 

I couldn't comprehend that he existed as that, as a conscious thing that had been carved of its insides. “You were the property of an evil and very powerful little girl who owns this town and everyone in it,” my Mom spat in my ear. 

“They made me keep my mouth shut, so I begged them to save one of you. Just one. I had to cut one of you down before I went crazy.”

I was still screaming when she calmly dragged me to my car, slipping a shot into the flesh of my neck. I remember the rain pounding against the window, my mother’s pale face shining with tears, her stifled sobs into the wheel. 

“And I chose you.” 

I woke up the next morning with what was supposed to be a wiped memory. 

But I wasn't lucky enough to forget.

I am terrified of her finding out I remember her exact words from the car-ride home. I'm scared she (or her work) will make me forget them for real. 

Mom told me that I once had strings too.

Strings that cut through me, cruelly entangling around me, suffocating my mind and controlling my every move. Strings that would soon pierce through me and turn me into a little girl’s doll. 

But she saved me, cutting me down, when I was still human. 

And now I guess I am a real girl.",2,1758829356.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1nqge2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1nqge2u/weak_resume_am_i_cooked/,Weak Resume - Am I cooked?,"Hello, I currently a Junior accountant student at a school called Kean University (A NJ State school). I transferred in just this year from a much smaller liberal arts college. Due to some school credits not transferring Im forced to redo my junior year (I should be a senior) This is besides the point, I have been looking into internships for the best year and with this fall window I hope to land something for the 2026 summer. The problem is that it seems the like the window is already closing, my network is small, and my resume is weak. 

Resume details:

3.2 GPA

Inventory Clerk Contract Job (1 Month)
Owner of a small Media company (1 year)
Accounting Intern (1 Month with my Aunt)

Student Athlete 
Accounting Club member 

Let me break it down clearly:

Last winter I decided I was going to switch schools for athletic & academic reasons. I was going to switch to a school with a better team and just a larger school (more resources). So in the early months of 2025 i was locked in, applying for a bunch of internships, cold-emails, coffee chats, I was digging deep in my super small network. I did get some interviews but I feel like i didn’t preform the best and my resume isn’t the greatest. I never got something in the works.

Fast forward to today, I feel like I used up all my resources last winter to help find jobs and now I feel like I am back at square one with applying to internships. 

This time around I want to apply to right firms and stay away from big4. Looking for opportunities that are actually achievable.

Any tips?",1,1758829087.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False

1nqg8dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1nqg8dl/night_auditor_stories_off_the_mississippi_in_a/,Night Auditor stories off the Mississippi in a small forgotten town- Happened almost 20 years ago.,"After years of listening to creepy stories, I finally decided it was time to share my own experiences.

This story takes place nearly 20 years ago, and even now, sometimes I wonder if it really happened or if I was just having a moment of insanity. But every time I think back to that time, I can’t find another explanation for what I went through.

When I was a barely 18 year old young woman, I found myself working the night shift at an old plantation house turned hotel right by the Mississippi River. This hotel stood alone on a stretch of highway with only a single gas station nearby, and beyond that, it was just miles of forest and river. People often talked about the thick fog that rolled in each night, saying it brought strange occurrences with it.

The hotel/old plantation house, had two floors. The first floor was the front office, a small breakfast area, and a kitchen where I prepared the continental breakfast for our few guests. The second floor was only accessible by a narrow staircase and had two offices, plus three emergency-only rooms. They rented those out in case of emergencies because, as they put it, ""You never know who you’re going to be locked in with at night."" In addition to the main building, there were two other structures from the 1970s at the back of the property that housed guest rooms.

I had found myself stranded in this tiny shit town that felt like it was stuck in time. But I was broke, my car needed repairs, and all I had were two suitcases of clothes. The owner of the local grocery store mentioned the odd hotel down the road needing a night auditor, because it was hard to keep someone on that second night shift.

Desperate and hungry, I applied for the job. The ""interview"" was with a grumpy old woman and another woman we’ll call Sally. Sally had been the night audit there for years but needed a few nights off here and there and had a surgery coming that would keep her out for three months. They didn’t ask the usual interview questions but instead wanted to know if I was okay with strange things happening and if I could run a basic Windows 98 computer to generate end-of-night reports. Without thinking much, I said yes and said I could start right away. Since I was homeless, they offered me a room in one of the back buildings at a greatly reduced rate. I thought I could earn enough money to fix my car and escape this bizarre little town.

My first night of training was with Sally, and I tried to joke about the “strange happenings” that people had mentioned to me. She didn’t laugh; instead, she looked at me seriously and said, “They have to get used to you. Just play nice, and they will too.” Her tone caught me off guard, leaving an uncomfortable silence between us before I muttered a quiet “yes, ma’am.” Looking back, I should have asked her what she meant by that statement. Who exactly was going to have to get used to me?

However, this was almost 20 years ago, and even with the odd vibe, I really needed this job, so I kept my mouth shut and focused on learning the systems. After two nights of training with Sally, I was on my own.

My first week was quiet, I got into my groove and had my routine....And this night, the first time anything happened, had started like all the others.  I finished running the 1 AM reports, and then I had about three hours to pass until I needed to start making breakfast. This was usually when the newspaper delivery lady showed up to bundle her papers in our entryway carport, which had the only decent lighting on the dark highway. Around 4:30 AM, Officer Camp and her rookie partner would come by for their morning coffee and muffins.

During this lull, I settled in with a new book. Just as I was about to dive in, I heard what sounded like footsteps right above me. But these didn’t sound like they were not coming from the floor above—they sounded like they were walking on the ceiling right above my head. At first, it was just a faint shuffle, but it quickly grew louder. I even felt and saw bits of ceiling dust flutter down around me.

I convinced myself it was just the old pipes or the air conditioning kicking in since the hotel was over a hundred years old. So, I brushed it off. But then I heard a loud crash—like several heavy objects being thrown down the stairs just off to the left of the front desk. It startled me so much that I jumped up and screamed, thinking a guest must have fallen down the stairs. I dashed from behind the front desk through a series of doors, bracing for the sight of destruction and chaos. But when I got there, I found...nothing. Just an empty hallway and quiet stairs.

I stood there in disbelief, trying to understand how what I heard could make no sense at all. Everything within me screamed to go back behind the desk, but my curiosity got the best of me. What if someone was lurking upstairs? What if an animal got in? I grabbed the master keys and a heavy flashlight, determined to investigate further.....At this time in my life I was fueled by piss and vinegar, and had no sense of self preservation it seems.  Because me now, as a grown woman, would have simply left the property.

As I was climbing the stairs to the second floor, I noticed something odd: all five doors were open just a few inches. These doors could only be opened with my keys or the guest keys locked in the office. I was certain I had checked this floor earlier and that all the doors had been closed.

Feeling a rush of adrenaline, I thought, “Okay, time to call Officer Camp.” After all, she had given me her card during my training. As I turned to leave, I figured I’d at least close the doors before heading downstairs. But as I reached for one, it slammed shut, along with all the other doors at once. The loud slamming echoing through the old building.  I screamed and lost my balance, tumbling down the stairs with a loud crash, hitting the wall and creating noise that echoed around me.  I must have sounded like chaos and destruction, as I finally hit the bottom of the stairs, crumpled and bruised.

When I finally gathered myself at the bottom of the stairs, I quickly called Officer Camp. She showed up to do a walk-through of the hotel, but what unsettled me most was her lack of surprise. As if she had gotten many of these calls before.  On the call, she laughed and said, “I am surprised I did not hear from you sooner.  It sounds like they have not gotten used to you yet. It took Sally years.”

This was the moment that shaped my next 4 months of employment there.

And ultimately, ""they"" never did get used to me....and continuously made that known.

(If you would like some other spooky stories from my time here, I will be happy to share them.  This occurrence was a very mild one in comparison to others. But I wanted to start here, because of how crazy it sounds. And also, I didnt want to be ripped apart by reddit lol)

I've decided to resign from trying for SSI, it's not serving me, it's not working, and i'm suffering in an entirely different way than physically now.

I really don't know what to expect, when I was interviewed I mentioned my conditions without going into too much detail, and I was reassured that i'd be able to take breaks and sit. but will that be enough? what if my body just can't keep up? I can barely go grocery shopping, I don't know how i'm going to do this.

You know that moment at the end of a meeting when you flip through your notebook and can't tell if a certain scribble is a groundbreaking idea or a grocery list? I used to have a whole drawer dedicated to those semi-legible, coffee-stained pages. It felt like my best thoughts were being held hostage by my own handwriting.



My turning point was reading about something called the ""generation effect."" It's a psychological principle that we remember information better when we actively create it ourselves, like writing it down, rather than just passively receiving it. But that only works if you can actually \*find\* what you wrote later. That was my real problem.



That's when I started using this notebook support. It wasn't a magic fix, but it provided the structure my chaotic note-taking needed. I could finally keep all my meeting notes for a single project in one designated section, and the built-in tagging meant I could actually locate that one specific comment from three weeks ago. The paper is smooth, which is a small thing, but it makes writing feel less like a chore.



The coolest part? I learned that the simple act of organizing notes by hand in a clear system can strengthen memory recall more than typing. It forces your brain to categorize information as you write. So now, my messy drawer is empty, and I feel like I'm actually using my notes instead of just collecting them. It’s made all the difference.

This same misery is now being seen in comments as fall now falls upon us…and the winter chill and snow is no longer distant.

In our case, the conversation changes from solution discussions to such timeless treasure questions as:

“Why am I on this site?”
“Did Jon keep the boxes at his home and just leave pictures?
“What color are the boxes at dusk?”
“Why haven’t I found a treasure box yet?”
“Where is my phone?”
“Could all the treasure boxes be in Portland? I live here and could look for all of them on weekends.”
“Has anyone seen my keys?”

1nqfywo,https://i.redd.it/539t37vz2drf1.jpeg,Coffee & Wine 🍷,"There are two things in our world that many individuals are quite passionate about – coffee and wine!

While one is usually enjoyed during the day and the other at night, coffee and wine share more similarities than you probably think.

Keep reading to learn what the key similarities between coffee and wine truly are!

1. Coffee and Wine Have Many Varieties

Coffee and wine both come in countless varieties, and they are both grown in many different parts of the world.

Each variety of coffee has its own distinct flavour, and some may only thrive in specific terroirs. Similarly, certain grapes are tailored to different terroirs, causing every variety of wine to have a unique flavour profile.

2. Both are Produced From Highly Specific Growing Regions

The environment in which our coffee and wine are produced, developed, and nurtured has a big impact on the end product.

When comparing wine with coffee, it is evident that they both come from very specific growing regions. The climate, altitude, sun exposure, and type of soil all play a role in how coffee and wines taste.

Coffee from Kenya tends to be more full-bodied, but coffee from South America is more acidic and sweet. The same goes for wine. French wines are lighter-bodied and more acidic than wines from California. The different regions all contribute to coffee and wine aromas, flavours, and textures.

Di Stefano stocks a range of coffee beans from a multitude of growing regions across the globe. Discover them on our specialty coffee online shop today.

3. Coffee and Wine Both Have Unique Aromas and Flavours

Like wine, coffee has a distinctive mix of flavours that are exclusive to its variety, geography, and roasting method. Most wines have fruity aromas, such as cherry, strawberry, and blackberry for red wines and apple and pear for white wines. Each type and variety of wine will have a distinctive taste profile.

Coffee has earthy, floral, and nutty aromas as well as a bitter, sweet, and acidic flavour. Different varieties of coffee will each have a unique flavour. For example, our 109 Specialty Coffee Beans are sourced from Ethiopia and a blend of bold cherry and sweet lemon, that creates caramel tones on the palate that provide a refreshing yet understated flavour.

4. The Production Process is Extensive

Although the production processes for coffee and wine are different, they are both quite extensive and have a lot in common with ageing.

Wine may take 5-7 years to age whereas coffee can take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. In some circumstances, coffee is aged in barrels exactly like wine. Aged wine and coffee will have a milder flavour. Our Distefano medium roast is a perfect example!

Similar to how choices made during the winemaking process in the cellar will impact the end product, the roasting process has an impact on the coffee’s aroma and flavour.

5. How They Are Served Matters

A good cup of coffee or glass of wine depends on how the beverage is served.

The way the coffee is ground, the temperature of the water used to make the coffee, and how it is poured all impact coffee’s taste.

Like coffee, wine needs to be properly prepared and served at the right temperature to produce a wonderful experience.

Similar to how coffee lovers desire the highest-quality coffee with the finest flavour, wine enthusiasts like to sip on high-quality wines that satisfy their palates.

The doctor also got me to do bloods which then came back indicating that my lipase levels were high. Also I should mention earlier before taking mounjaro I had a gastroscopy and colonoscopy for other reasons, they did say that I had gastritis which would make sense since I consume quite alot of coffee and usually strong coffee too which irritates my stomach. The doctor did say to limit my coffee to 1 a day and I did try but have ended up having 2 to sometimes 3 strong coffees. 

Anyway I stopped taking the ticadine tablets because my stomach had settled down, although sometimes I do feel my stomach is mildly sore. Had recent bloods been having them every 3 weeks and my levels are rising. Doctor is baffled as I did do the ct scan that determined no gall stones, pancreas is fine ect. So now just routine bloods. Its sitting at 150 she said, she did mention the gastritis could possibly be whats triggering it. I've decided to only have 1 coffee a day and start taking the indigestion tablets again to see if that will help lower the levels.....

I'm also eating much better now, high protein diet + vegetables and healthy fats and carbs as I go to the gym. I stopped taking creatine as the doctor said its not good for the kidneys, have protein powder which doctor didn't recommend taking either. 

I'm stumped has anyone else had high lipase levels correlated to the inflammation in the stomach? ",1,1758828068.0,pancreatitis,1,1.0,False

1nqfu2o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqfu2o,Review: 5 Nights at Impression Moxché by Secrets (Signature Swimout Suite Tropical View),"Stayed for 5 nights on the Impressions side with my girlfriend (late 20s, I’m early 30s, both from Los Angeles). We had a Signature Swimout Suite Tropical View Room. I want to start off by saying we loved our stay and had a good experience, but I’m going to be critical in this review and step outside the vacation bubble a bit. We went in late September which is off-season and hurricane season, so your experience may vary. We like traveling this time of year because it’s quieter, less crowded, and not as hot.

We arrived by private transfer and were greeted by the staff and bellhops who took our luggage and later brought it to our room. After a short walk through the lobby we were moved over to the Impressions side. Once through the double doors we had the option to stop at the Impressions bar and refreshment area, or continue to our room. We went straight to the room. Check-in was smooth and we were promptly greeted by one of our butlers who gave us a quick lay of the land and some restaurant info.

##**The Room**

The room itself was spacious with a relaxing mix of wood and stone that gave it a nice, luxurious feel. Toiletries are Le Labo Bergamote 22 which is nice, but the lotion felt watered down. We always travel with our own anyway, and I’d recommend you do the same.

We were excited about the swimout, but it turned out to be more for ambiance than actual use. On the first night, the pool lights weren’t working and didn’t get fixed until the following evening. Even with the lights on, the water was too cold to use and we later learned the swimouts aren’t heated. There was a little trash left over from the previous guests, the pool beds were dirty with bird poop and ants, and there were tons of mosquitoes. Nothing you can fully control in nature, but it would have been nice if they cleaned and prepped it before new guests arrived. Our swimout was on the tropical side, so not fully covered by foliage, and every now and then staff or cars passed on the service road beside it, which led to some awkward eye contact moments.

Inside the room, the king bed was comfortable and the pillows were on the firmer side but fine. The A/C was strong but you couldn’t keep it off for long or the room would develop that classic sweaty hotel smell (if you travel a lot you know what I mean). They do provide incense if that’s your thing. We also liked being able to customize our mini-fridge through our butler. The only complaint my girlfriend had was the lighting, which wasn’t great for doing makeup. There’s a magnifying ring-lit vanity in the bathroom, but it’s attached to the wall. On the positive side, I asked our butler to run us a romantic bath one night in the in-room jacuzzi tub and it was honestly a great touch.

As part of a UVC (Ultimate Vacation Club) sales pitch, we were shown the Master Suite Ocean View. Both of us agreed we actually preferred the swimout room we had.

##**Food**

We didn’t get to try everything, but here’s what stood out.

Suki (Japanese): Solid. We eat a lot of sushi back home so maybe our standards are higher, but the rolls were just okay and the sashimi wasn’t good. The baby back ribs, crispy Brussels sprouts, and hot pot rice with truffle were very good though.

Cielo (Lunch): Mixed. The rib-eye tacos, jumbo shrimp, and guacamole were good. The Baja oysters were not, and the ceviche and aguachile didn’t measure up to mariscos spots in LA.

Seaside Beach Club: This was our favorite spot. Breakfast here was fine (we both had chilaquiles), but sipping coffee with our feet in the sand was special. We came back for dinner twice. The Caribbean lobster was my girlfriend’s favorite dish of the trip, and the filet anticuchos were mine. Service and drinks were great both nights. We also tried their Lighting Fire surf and turf buffet. It was fine, but I’d skip it if you’re short on nights.

Market Café (Buffet): We went three times for breakfast. Good variety with stations for omelets, tacos, customizable toasts, waffles, etc. You get seated and a server takes care of drinks while you do the rounds. Only once did we wait, about 10 minutes. Could see it being overwhelming during peak season.

Allora (Italian): Decent, not a standout. Some good dishes (carpaccio, truffle gnocchi), some just okay. Worth noting several interesting dishes are upcharges like the $190 porterhouse or $60 pastas and pizzas.

Dos Almas (Mexican): Wanted to try but our butler made a reservation on a night it was closed.

Observatory: Exclusive to Impressions and Preferred. Amazing view. Had a light lunch here and the shrimp aguachile was excellent. Tried to come back for breakfast but it was packed.

Teodoro (AAA Five Diamond): Free with 5+ nights on the Impressions side. Service and plating were beautiful, but food was underwhelming. I wouldn’t pay extra for it, but it’s a nice experience if included.

Room Service: We tried it twice. Decent selection but slow (over an hour, almost two for dessert one night). Desserts were mixed. The crème brûlée was my favorite, the crepes were bad. Tried ordering “Cacao of the Gods” twice and it was never available.

Coco Café: Open 24/7. Good selection of coffees and pastries. Smoothies weren’t great. Could use protein shakes and fresh juices on the menu.

##**Spa**

We each had a free 25-minute massage included, but we also went to the Vacation Club pitch which gave us $200 credit. We used it to upgrade to two 50-minute relaxing massages. They were fine, not bad at all, but definitely not worth full price if you’re paying out of pocket.

##**Gym**

The gym is on top of the spa building and the layout is awkward. They have treadmills and stationary bikes on each end, with resistance machines in the middle. Dumbbells only go up to 50 pounds. There’s one vertical smith machine, two benches, and a few Technogym machines including a chest press, shoulder press, leg press, and a leg extension and curl hybrid. Basically on par with a decent apartment complex gym. If you want it to yourself, go mid-day. I went around 2 PM and it was empty. Between 7 AM and 10 AM it was slammed.

##**Entertainment & Amenities**

The shows at Moxché Theatre were fun. Nothing spectacular, but good for a night with drinks. Our favorite was Quirky. Impressions guests get their own section with at-seat cocktail service, but it fills up quickly. The acrobats were talented, and while the singing was hit or miss, the vibe was fun overall.

We checked out Gypsy Club, the resort’s nightclub. Music wasn’t our taste, but the space was nice.

The pools were hands down the highlight. Having access to the Impressions rooftop infinity pools made the upgrade worth it. The main Impressions pool area was also beautiful and well staffed. We didn’t spend much time on the Secrets side, but honestly we’d come back just for the Impressions pools.

The beach is small, which we knew before booking. There was some sargassum but it didn’t bother us. Crews were out cleaning daily. The only downside was the third-party massage sellers wandering around waving signs. Annoying, but not a dealbreaker. You can rent beachfront cabanas and daybeds with champagne, but we found Seaside Beach Club gave us the same feel for free.

The butlers were hit or miss. Sometimes helpful, sometimes misinformed. One reservation was made for a night the restaurant was closed. They did send daily activity lists over WhatsApp which was nice, but overall it felt like they mostly came around to collect tips.

There were also a few power outages during our stay. Nothing that really bothered us, since we know how areas of Mexico can be during this time of year, but worth noting. The longest outage lasted about 30 minutes.

##**Ultimate Vacation Club Pitch**

We knew what we were getting into and only agreed to it for the resort “monopoly money” we’d get at the end, which we put toward our spa massages. It’s a high-pressure sales pitch, and by the end we had to say “no” to four different people before they finally let us go. Doing this pitch can take the vacation blinders off, since afterward you start noticing all the UVC reps walking around with their eyes on unassuming guests. We were told it would be a 1.5 hour presentation, but it dragged on for over 2 hours. When we tried to leave, we were told they “had to finish their job.” In the final sales room, someone bought a package and staff rolled out an ice bucket of champagne while everyone clapped, like a scene from Wolf of Wall Street. They tried roping us into their top package, which was priced at $500k with a long contract obligation. I didn’t even bother paying attention to the details.

##**Final Thoughts**

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. The property is beautiful, relaxing, and very Instagrammable. The food ranged from good to just okay, and some service elements could improve. For the right price, I would come back, especially for the pools.

Final Rating: 7/10

1nqftvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticFreeLiving/comments/1nqftvx/coffee_tea_or_microplastics_guess_what_you_dont/,"Coffee, tea, or microplastics?  Guess what?  You don't get to choose!","(Full disclosure: I sell water filters at [therightfilter.com](http://therightfilter.com) so I'm DEFINITELY biased)

I admit to being a little dismissive of the whole ""plastics are gonna kill us!"" attitude on the internets. But I am of the Olds and there was a time when this wondrous substance was going to lead the charge of a new better future for us all.

But these days, it does take a very special kind of myopia to suggest that all  plastic is ""completely harmless, don't worry, nothing to see here"". Like, the kind of myopia that jeopardized Mr. Magoo's survival (look it up, kids...then get off my lawn).  

My issue is when I have to explain to panicked customers, that there are options and solutions, they start leaning into this VIOLENTLY anti-plastic stance like ""there's plastic in the teflon tape being used in my pipes! that's gonna kill me!"" or ""why isn't there a completely plastic free water filtration solution?! it's a conspiracy!!"".  

Look, fine, yes, there are issues. But are you worrying about that stuff while buying plastic bottled anything? I ask because a[ recent study in the UK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725018285) showed that **100%** of the samples taken from ""popular UK brands, including coffee, tea, juices, energy drinks, soft drinks, and even tap and bottled water"" had microplastics (MPs). The ""particles were fragments (72–93%), ranging from 10 to 157 μm, with polypropylene being the most common polymer type.""  

And apparently, all the previous research has been focused on MPs in drinking water. So, ""\[a\]sessing microplastics exposure from water only underestimates total daily intake,"" and the amount might be closer to **60-70% higher** than when they just measured water. (""1.7 MPs/kg body weight/day for females and 1.6 MPs/kg body weight/day for males, which is higher than estimated microplastic exposure via drinking water only (1 MPs/Kg body weight/day"").

Which is just plain horrifying. And you should be worried.  But like, *reasonably* worried.

Because 10 μm (10 microns) is pretty huge in water filtration terms.  Hell, finding a sub 1 micron filter is like finding sand at a beach. (speaking of beaches, apparently PFAS is [more heavily concentrated in sea foam](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5c03600) than the water below.  not relevant to plastic free living, but hey, good to know?)

What I'm saying is, yes, microplastics are a Real Problem.  But there are solutions that can seriously reduce your exposure (and you see a lot of them on this sub!).  And, yes, *reducing* your exposure isn't the same as *eliminating* your exposure (but that's impossible once you start factoring in NANOplastics).  

Eventually, we'll get to a truly plastic free life. There's tons of research around bioplastics, bioremediation, better measurement and tracking protocols that put the onus on the producers not the consumers, and so on, so on.  And, on that sweet day, we'll look back on these plastic filled days with the same horror as leaded gasoline, radium makeup, and hat-making with mercury.  

Until then, **reduction** is doable, right now, easily, and in a lot of cases, save you a bunch of money!",5,1758827794.0,PlasticFreeLiving,0,0.78,False

1nqfrmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1nqfrmd/when_the_farming_luna_returns/,when the farming luna returns,"Chapter 1
I spent twenty years out in farm country running a small herb farm.

When eight luxury cars pulled up at the gate of my little place, I froze.

An older Alpha with a hard, imperious face looked me over and said in an icy voice, “As the heir to the Frostfang Pack, even if you were abducted back then, you shouldn’t have let yourself slide this far. Don’t tell me you can’t make something of yourself just because you live out in the sticks. And you even married some deadbeat who never holds a real job. You’ve dragged the Frostfang Pack’s name through the mud.”

My oh-so-loving brother pinched his nose like the air offended him and stared at me with disgust. “I only recognize Audrey as my sister. From now on, everything in the Frostfang Pack belongs to her. Don’t even think about fightin..6.g her for it.”

I was baffled.

Since when did growing things count as “letting myself slide”?

The plot behind my house—about sixteen acres—was planted with rare medicinal plants.

And that “deadbeat mate” they were sneering at—did they mean the Shadowhowl Pack’s Alpha, the one who practically lived at the research lab and lost himself in his experiments?

When I returned to the Frostfang Pack, I saw for the first time how old money operated in the pack world—opulence and excess everywhere.

My “dear” sister, Audrey Bennett, was draped in diamonds. She glided over and, all politeness and poise, took my hand with a show of regret. “Vanessa, I’ve prayed day and night to the Moon Goddess to bless Mom and Dad and help them find their real daughter. Now that you’re finally back, they can have some peace.”

As she lifted her wrist, the diamond-studded Patek Philippe on it threw a blinding flash.

Alpha Jason—my biological father—sat at the head of the table, features carved in stone, his eyes assessing me as if I were a product that hadn’t passed inspection. “Vanessa, now that you’re back, you’re going to learn proper manners. Stop showing up all countrified and making the Frostfang Pack look bad.”

He took a measured sip of his coffee, his expression unreadable, then continued, “Back then, when you went missing, we found Audrey on the road. She’s now the mate of Dylan Price, a medicinal-supply tycoon. Even if you’re back, Audrey has been with us for over twenty years; she’s long been part of the Bennett family. Publicly, I’ll say you’re a distant relative the family took in.”

“When you can carry yourself with some grace, I’ll formally acknowledge you as my daughter.”

I looked at Jason Bennett calmly. Thirty-odd years of life had taught me to see the angle: test me first, and only then decide whether to claim me.

Not once did he ask whether I’d suffered or whether I’d been well.

That TV-drama fantasy in which they hand you the keys to a mansion and a fleet of cars didn’t exist. There wasn’t even a shadow of it here.

I smiled lightly. “All right.”

At least I’d found where I came from. It was something I’d needed to settle.

Everyone stared at me, surprised I agreed so easily.

Sitting beside Audrey, my brother Eric Bennett finally lost his patience. Holding his temper by a thread, he said, “Audrey’s brilliant—top of her class at Columbia University. Her mate’s a big name. Even if you’re back, don’t you dare think you can replace her. Get it through your head that you’re just a small-town nobody.”

“Otherwise, the Frostfang Pack wouldn’t bother taking in a walking disaster like you.”

I looked at him and caught a flicker of an old memory: him carrying me on his back, both of us laughing in the wind.

Now, his eyes held only Audrey.

I gave him a faint smile. “All right.”

Jason Bennett’s face darkened; he set his cup down with a dull thud. “Is ‘all right’ the only thing you know how to say? Can’t you form a view of your own?”

“Sycophantic and spineless—people like you will never be fit for polite company.”

“I’m warning you: if that so-called mate of yours is a loser, cut him off now. Don’t bring him here to embarrass me and my Frostfang Pack.”

Chapter 2
He didn’t even finish before his face tightened with irritation and disgust, as if he already regretted bringing me home.

I drew a long breath, steadied myself, and said evenly, “Alpha, I can’t break it off with my mate. He’s clingy; he can’t function without me.”

Jason slammed his palm on the table; the sound exploded in the room. “You can’t bear to part with some stray drifter? He’s only hanging on to squeeze something out of you. The Frostfang Pack isn’t a charity. If he doesn’t take the hint, we’ll break his legs.”

He took a few bills from his inside pocket, tossed them onto the table, and said, “This is for sending him away tomorrow. Don’t you dare make a spectacle of it.”

The bills fluttered to the floor.

A flicker of mockery crossed Audrey’s face—scorn and satisfaction. No matter that I was the real heiress; in her mind she’d already married into power, had brains and backing, and I would spend the rest of my life looking up at her.

“Vanessa, you’re not a kid anymore, and you’re still hung up on some crude brute?” She hid a smile behind her hand, her voice sugar-sweet and cutting. “You really are settling.”

Anger flashed across Eric’s face. “Vanessa, I’m warning you—don’t bring that kind of roughneck here. If you try it, you can pack your things and get out.”

I didn’t want to argue, so I said, “All right.”

Eric and Audrey traded looks and smiled, their contempt deepening. In their eyes, my compliance only meant I was afraid of losing the comfort and status in front of me.

Jason waved me off in disappointment and told the butler to show me to a room.

I sat alone in a cramped attic, my heart gone cold.

I knew this place. When I was little and played hide-and-seek with my brother, I fell asleep behind a stack of junk. When I woke, he was on his knees in the living room and Dad stood over him with a cane, saying, “You were supposed to watch Audrey. If we don’t find Vanessa, I’ll beat you to death.” My brother hugged me and cried; back then his eyes were full of joy at finding me, not a trace of blame.

I was staring at a little doodle I’d carved in the wall when Audrey pushed the door open. She put on a show of concern, took my hand, and said, “I’m sorry, Vanessa. I never wanted to steal your identity, but Mom and Dad already chose me. Handing it back now wouldn’t be appropriate.”

She said it lightly, but pride gleamed beneath the words. “Don’t worry. If you like anything of mine, take it. I don’t care for worldly things. Dad and Eric have given me more than I can use.”

I looked at the emerald necklace at her throat—the one Mom used to loop over my neck, laughing, “When you’re grown, I’ll give this to you. Wear it on your wedding day.” I lifted a hand and smiled faintly. “Give it to me. I like it.”

Audrey’s expression froze; she clearly hadn’t expected me to ask so directly.

She’d taken me for timid and pliant, someone who wouldn’t fight for anything. When I reached for what was mine, her disdain flipped to shock.

“What’s wrong? Were those pretty words just for show? Or are you hoarding what belongs to me while you try to make me look bad?” My gaze didn’t leave her, and my voice cooled.

Color surged into Audrey’s face, then drained, then flared again. She yanked the necklace until the chain snapped and burst into tears. “Vanessa, this is from Mom. How could you destroy it?”

Chapter 3
Audrey’s voice went so shrill it could have punched a hole in the ceiling.

The door flew open and Eric barreled in first. The moment Audrey saw him, she collapsed against his chest and wailed, “Eric, I told her she could take what she wanted, but she insisted on this necklace. Mom’s still overseas getting treatment; this necklace is all I have of her. I can’t let it go.”

A sharp slap cracked through the attic. Eric glowered at me. “I knew you were up to no good. That meek act downstairs was fake. You came back to grab the estate.”

“Listen to me. If you keep your head down, the Frostfang Pack won’t shortchange you. But if you try to fight Audrey, you can march right back to your herb farm.”

Dad came in then. He looked down, saw the broken chain on the floor, and his face iced over. His voice was colder than before. “Stirring up trouble the moment you return? Your mother is undergoing treatment abroad, and this is how you treat her things? Looks like you never learned any discipline out in farm country. Go kneel in the courtyard for three hours and learn what manners mean.”

I touched my stinging cheek, oddly numb inside.

I’d thought finding what I’d lost would bring comfort. Instead, it became a pretext to humiliate me.

I straightened my clothes, picked up my bag, and turned for the door. “Alpha, since I offend you all so much, I’ll go—no need to let me disgrace the Frostfang Pack.”

I had barely taken a step when Eric clamped a hand around my arm and sneered. “What game is this? You run off tonight so you can faint at the door tomorrow and let the world call us heartless?”

Audrey clung to his arm and chimed in, “She only wants to dodge Dad’s punishment.”

At that, disgust twisted both Dad’s and Eric’s faces.

“Vanessa, you’re all cowardice,” Dad said, impatient. “You screw up and you run. Tonight you’ll learn the pack’s rules.”

Two security men came in and pinned me by the shoulders. Eric narrowed his eyes and snapped, “Take her outside. Thirty lashes, then three hours on her knees. Not a minute less.”

I fought hard, but they forced me to the floor. Eric saw me struggling, signaled for a barbed whip, and said, “Since the young lady won’t listen, we’ll enforce house discipline. Start with thirty.”

I glared up at him and warned, “Eric, let me go, or my mate won’t spare you.”

“His name is Adam Nolan,” I said, my voice flat.

Adam wasn’t just a leader in research; he was a titan in business—sitting on patents and industry decisions, with a hand on more than a few economic lifelines.

By rights, the name should have given them pause. Instead, Eric barked out a laugh, as if I’d told him the sky was green. “Adam Nolan? You mean the country’s top billionaire? That’s your mate? You might as well claim the Alpha King is your mate.”

Audrey scoffed beside him. “I’ve met Adam. Polished, gracious—the kind of man half the world dreams of. Don’t insult our intelligence.”

Eric lost the last of his restraint and cracked the whip across my back. “Still stubborn. You won’t admit fault and you’re trying to run.”

Pain ripped through me. I opened my mouth to speak of Adam again, and the second lash landed. “Say one more ridiculous word and I’ll make it forty.”

I caught the whip with both hands and ground out, “Eric, what gives you the right to hit me? Why couldn’t my mate be Adam Nolan?”

Chapter 4
Eric shook with rage. “You—you still dare run your mouth? Do you want the entire Frostfang Pack laughing at me for having a crazy woman for a sister? If I hear you claim one more time that Adam Nolan is your mate, I’ll kill you!”

The angrier he got, the harder the lashes fell. Pain racked me until I trembled all over. When I looked up, I realized he was dipping the whip in salt water.

My voice shook, but I still forced the words out. “Eric Bennett, I’m giving you one last chance. Otherwise I’ll air the Frostfang Pack’s dirty laundry.”

He only grew more incensed, and the blows came down even harder. The pain finally knocked me out.

When I came to, I was back in the attic. I was bracing to sit up when Audrey swept in with an armful of clothes.

She looked down at me and laughed coldly. “Vanessa, if it isn’t yours, don’t even think about it. Why insist on bringing this on yourself?”

She flung the clothes into my face. “These are things I don’t want anymore. They’re a little old, but at least they’re limited-edition pieces by a French house. I doubt you’ve ever worn anything like this in your life.”

They smelled musty. I pulled them off and felt a cold smile tug at my lips. She’d really scrounged up castoffs; the house staff probably wouldn’t have taken them.

Seeing me keep quiet, Audrey decided I’d backed down, and the contempt in her eyes deepened. She preened. “Dad’s throwing you a welcome dinner tomorrow. You’d better wear what I gave you and behave yourself.”

She sashayed out.

The moment she left, my brother came in.

“We can’t give you your proper place, but we can put on the right show. Tomorrow’s welcome dinner will bring out the power families among the packs. Don’t spout nonsense, and don’t embarrass the Frostfang Pack.”

He tossed me a necklace. “I bought this for Audrey. She thinks it looks dated. It suits you. Wear it tomorrow, stick close to her, and keep your head down.”

I took one look at the dull, clunky throwback and tossed it aside. They might not know it, but I’d long since learned to treat that sort of trinket like trash.

My phone chimed.

Adam:[R&D’s wrapped. I’m on the plane. I’ll see you tomorrow. 😘]

I smiled and texted back:

Nessa replied:[I found my birth parents. I’m at the Frostfang Pack. Pick me up at the welcome dinner tomorrow.]

# Fang & Cottontail, Chapter 4

\---  

  


\[A pillar of late morning sun divides the gloomy dorm room in half, slowly making its way from one wall to the other as the morning passes, finally finding its mark. Sprawled out on his back, still half asleep, lies a grey wolf, dressed only in green & grey plaid pyjama shorts, the beam of sun tracing a line across his abdomen. He stirs slightly, rolling over to his side, and shudders slightly, his abbs tighten, and his tail straightens\]

\[He growls in agitation, his teeth visible for a moment, his eyelids tensed before he sighs, the tension in his muscles releasing as he rolls back over and begrudgingly sits up, his amber eyes turning almost golden as the sunlight catches them\]

*""What Time is it, shit, did I oversleep!?, wait no, no I'm suspended I can't go to class, guess I'll just go back to sleep, I'm still tired anyway""*

\[Knock, Knock, Knock\]

*""Never mind...""* \[He stumbles out of bed and throws on a shirt as he calls out\] ""Come in""

\[The door open's, whith one single brash movement, standing the other side is a larger framed bore in a gray uniform and fake black, tactical vest that's barely able to contain it's warer, a badge proudly pined to it's top corner ""Campus Security Chief"" engraved on the polished bronze, next to them is a fox, dressed in a genuine dark blue officer's outfit and vest, the bore steps forward gesturing the officer to folow him\]

""Here he is, Mr Snow in the fur, our would-be Plaintiff, he's all yours.""

\[He looks to Silver, adjusting his vest\]

""Please cooperate with my fellow officer, he's here to take a statement about everything that happened yesterday. I know you made a statement to me when you returned to campus yesterday, which I have passed on, but as informative as I'm sure it was, they need to collect one themselves. All standard procedure, that's all""

\[The officer, politely containing his scepticism behind a professional smile, nods to the bore\],

""Thank you, Campus Chief, I'll take this from here. I'm sure you have things to attend to, I'll see myself out once I'm done""

\[Seeming oblivious, the Chief nods\] ""Yes, well, I *am* busy, I'll leave him in your capable paws"" \[He walks away, closing the door behind him with a thud\]

""So, Mr Snow, I understand you had a pretty rough day yesterday. You're looking pretty good, all things considered, if the details I have are accurate, but I need to start with the basics. I need your full name, and some ID if you have it""

\[Silver nods, as he picks through his laundry and fishes his wallet out of the pocket of his ripped jeans\]

""Silfr Ivar Snow, but please just call me *Silver,* it's not you it just feels weird being called Mr Snow, it feels too formal""

\[The officer nods, as he begins to write on the tablet he had clutched under his arm\]

""Sure, I'm Officer Derwin, but feel free to call me Andrew if that's more comfortable. I'm not much worried about titles myself, now I'm going to read what I have here and I need you to confirm or correct me if this is wrong, and if you think thare is anything missing we should know""

\[Hours pass as Silver and the officer talk through the chain of events, adding & adjusting events as best he can based on what he can remember\]

""Ok, thank you, Silver. Sorry that took a while, but we seem to have this all squared up from your perspective. We've already spoken to Mr Woods, but we still need to speak to Miss Bramble & your dormmate, Mr Holiway""

""Would you mind calling him i know thare is a lot of gossip going on already, so it might be easier for all of you if I conduct his interview here instead of running around and searching for him, i used to come here years ago, and the journalism club was ravnous whenever something hapned even near campus, and i dont imagen that's changed mutch""

\[Shifting in his chair restlessly, Silver nods\] ""Yeah, sure I can ask him, he should be done with class soon, he usually meets me for lunch""

\[He pulls up his phone and texts Jake\]

(""Haya Dude, you're not in trouble, but the police want a statement, mind coming back to the dorm room? He says it will be less drama if we keep it quiet"")

(""Sure, I'm almost finished with class"")  
(""i was going to come grab you for lunch"")  
(""I'm not letting you spend all day in bed"")  
(""You get grouchy if you're not moving"")

(""Wait? By police, you mean like real Police, or *""Officer""* Truffles"")

(""No real police, Smells like the Precinct"")

(""Ok, sure"")  
(""Wait, if the Fuzz are involved, you must be in like actual trouble"")  
(""I NEED the whole Story NOW"")  
(""Why do *you* know what the precinct smells like?"")  
(""You know weird stuff, dude"")

\[Silver looks up\] ""Ok, he should be on his way soon-ish, so knowing Jake, probably half an hour, you mind if I stretch my legs, I don't mind grabbing us some coffee or something?""

\[The officer seems to contemplate for a moment\],

""Ok, kid, now, because you have confessed to being involved in a physical altercation, and have had charges for assault and battery placed on you, you are under house arrest. In this case, I would presume that relates to the campus grounds, as you don't have a listed residence in the county we can send you to.

""Now you have been cooperative, so I'm not going to deem you a flight risk, so I don't need to give you a monitor for now, but stay on campus, ok""

\[The Restless Silver's face Harden's, eyebrows drawing into a scowl, his jaw quivering, his lips just slightly parting, each twitch revealing a flash of pearly white Fangs, he stares at the Officer, as his ears lower themselves backwards, streamlining his profile as his gaze grows sharper as he growls a word\] ""Who""

\[The Officer's Tail Curls slightly, though his face keeps its calm composure\] ""Calm it Kid, no use getting angry, that won't help you. The way I see it, you were defending yourself, so long as you don't do anything stupid, the charges will disappear once they realise they don't have a case""

\[Silver closes his eyes and his features return to normal\] ""Right, sorry, I'm just tired, hurt and fed up, I just tried to help someone and now I've got all this to deal with"" \[He slumps in his chair\]

\[Andrew gives a sympathetic smile\] ""I know, and you did the right thing, you're a good kid, don't mess it up, it'd suck if you got yourself in trouble after all that, so don't mess it up, i'd hate to have to try taze you""

""Taze me?""

""Yeah, you're on the leaner side for your class of wolf and don't have any formal training, but you're still above my weight class. I'm faster than you and I'm smart, but I'm lighter than you, in a brawl I *might* lose, and *Might* is not a risk I'm willing to take, so the next reasonable course of action is to hope I can get prongs in your fur""

""Wow, that's concerningly calculated""

""Instinct comes with the tail, Logic comes with the job. Now, if you still need to stretch your legs, feel free, and if I haven't upset you, I would like to accept your offer for coffee. Once I have your friend's statement, I'll be out of your fur""

\[Silver heads out and grabs 3 coffies & some cookies, taking the long way round through the college green, before heading back to his room, to find Jake talking to the Officer, slouched on his bed, chatting away\]

\[Jake sits up, tail swishing back and forth behind him\] ""Hay, Dude, thare you are, you good?""

""Yeah, I'm alright, I'll explain everything in a moment as promised, here Coffie""

\[Silver sets down the Paper cups and the brown bag of cookies, which Jake gleefully eyes as he grabs his coffee, before providing his statement\]

\[Once done, the officer excuses himself and leaves. As soon as the door closes, Jake turns, throwing the empty paper cup at Silver. It makes a little *^(Bonk)* as it bounces off his forehead\]

""Ok, Mr dark and mysterious, spill the tea""

\[Silver rolls his eyes, before once again retelling the story, Jake listens intently, lying on his stomach on his bed, feet up in the air behind him, his tail wagging, then stopping as he cycles between seemingly excited, concerned, intrigued, then worried\]

""Well, Shit, no wonder you're feeling like this, you literally had a run-in with the mob""

""Oh, don't be dramatic, it probably has nothing to do with that, it was probably just his dormmates, cats are Clicky like that, even if his dad is some street dealer or something, it's not like he's got his own personal thugs""

\[Jake Sighs\] ""Yeah, ok fine, you're right, that's just not as exciting, you know""

""Good, I'd rather it that way, my life is exciting enough, I have Uni that's enough for me""

\[Jake smirks\] ""Yes, so exciting, you eat breakfast, you study, you eat lunch, you study some more, you go for a walk, you eat dinner, then you sleep. You even join us for games in the lounge sometimes, truly riveting""

\[The teasing continues for some time before Jake lets up. By then, it's just past time for lunch and the two head to the cafeteria for something to eat. \]

\---    

  


\[Meanwhile, In Aloe's Dorm Room...\]

\[Sat cross from Aloe who's dressed in a simple green skirt, and a white long sleeve shirt sits another officer, a neat and tidy badger in a uniform, she nods slowly as she writes methodically\]

""I see, thank you, Miss Bramble. Your Account is appreciated. This seems to line up with our other testimonies. You have no charges against you from all this, so we don't need anything else from you for now. Are you sure you don't want to press charges on any of the perpetrators? The city will likely press charges on the men who chased you, but unless you choose to press them yourselves, Mr Wood's & Mr Snow will likely go without measure, they both caused you harm""

\[Aloe sips the last of her tea, as she gently shakes her head\]

""No, Pressing charges on Woods would spell more trouble, so I'd rather let it go, and Mr Snow, as I've outlined, was clearly acting to defend himself and me. I may not understand his motives for doing so, but I'm not going to repay him by charging him, even *if* his tackle is the cause of my sprained ankle & knee, I'd say it's better than whatever would have happened to me""

\[The Officer finishes writing and slings the Tablet's strap over her shoulder, leaving it to hang by her side\]

""Very well then, thank you for your time, Ms Bramble. Have a nice day. Should you change your mind and want some extra security, please let us know""

\[Aloe stands to see the officer out\] ""Thank you Officer. I'll be staying on campus for a while, I'm sure I'll be safe here""

\[As soon as the officer is out of sight, and the coast is seemingly clear, she slumps into a nearby chair and lets out a long Sigh, sinking into the plush sofa, abandoning her up-together & collected facade, allowing herself to be tired for a moment before she spots 3 pairs of charcoal grey ears & eyes peering from over the countertop of the Kitchenete atached to the Doorm's common room\]

\[She compses herself\] ""A fox less sightly than me""

\[The trio look to each other, confused, standing and emerging from the kitchenette\]

\[One of them sighs\] ""You talk like my grandmother sometimes""

\[Another mimes walking with a hunch & cane, while doing a terrible impression of an old lady\]  
""A fox less sightly than me would surely have you for tea""

\[the last of them just rolls her eyes at the other two\] ""Don't be too mean, she's just old-fashioned and proper, maybe if you two studied a bit more, you'd be mature too""

\[Aloe, adjusting the folds of her skirt, sets her gaze on the three with an air of seriousness as she stands\]

""I appreciate you like your gossip, and I understand that you need fuel for your newspapers, but I don't condone nor consent to your eavesdropping. If you really must write about my misfortunes, though I'd rather you didn't, at least have the decency to ask me first. 

\[Each word seemed to sap a little confidence from them, ears drooping more with each sentence\]

Be proper journalists, invite people for interviews, you'd have the network to find people who were in the canteen on the day, I know about that chat room where you lot trade for gossip, go get witness statements, pictures, testimonies, instead of acting like schoolgirls and spying on people""

\[Finished with her little lecture, she turns to leave, checking her watch\] 

\[Behind her, the three dejected-looking girls stand a little surprised. Someone usually so quiet and agreeable seemed like an elder for a moment, being compaired to a child seemed to strike a cord, perhaps because it was in a small part true. This was a university, not a college, they were adults now, the sisters all seemed to have the same thoughts, speaking almost in unison over each other\]

""She's right, though""  
""She kinda has a point""  
""She's not wrong, is she?""

\[They exchange looks before they all smile...\]

\---    



\[Five days later\]

\[Silver dawdles out of one of the smaller lecture rooms, a bored, numb expression on his face, having just survived a long, boring and unengaging lecture, the one he had been sentenced to after the incident, it had been the only thing he's done all week his suspention boreing him half to death, he never thaugh he'd miss his classes\]

\[As he's making his way back to his dorm room to change for a run to keep himself entertained, he hears a call out\]

""New Edition out now! The latest campus news, exclusive interviews with Fight Withinness, Jesica's new Furcare secrets and the District head's statement on the new On Campus Pool! Come read all about it!""

\[A shiver runs up his spine as he peers around the corner into the student lounge, standing on a pair of crates behind a news stand is a rabbit with dark grey charcoal fur, excitedly holding up a newspaper, a slightly blurry image of him, fangs bared, throwing Aloe, Wood's mid air behind him, claws out his pixelated face halfway between a grin and a scowl\]

\[Above it, a bold title, in a cursive font, ""Fang & Cottontail: A Fight for Survival?"" The crowd of people surrounding the stand exitedly shuffling past each other to snag a copy murmured loudly enough that the Din was uncomfortably loud, at least to Silver anyway, as if this couldn't get worse, across the room, as equally stunned & surprised stands Woods, the two somehow unseen, unotaced lock eyes, anger wells in Wood's eyes his Finger's splay out, his tail puff's up lashing from side to side, as his claw's flex from his fingertip's, on the other side of the standoff Silver's instinct kick's in, his muccles tense up, ear's pining themselve's back as he bair's his teath\]

\[The room goes silent as the prey fawn in the room freeze, thare own instincts kicking in, sensing the aggression, heads turn slowly, until all eyes are on them, for a few moments, everything is silent and still, no one daring to move, the seconds drag out for felt like minutes as the two stand off, before someone breaks, a rat dive's behind a bookshelf, and heard mentality kick's in the prey fawn, scatter, runing for the exit's, scrambling up post's, hideing behind overturned tables, leaving the space between them empty save for the few pred fawn who stand thare ground, eyeing the two down waiting to see what will hapen...\]

\[This moment too drags itself out, neither of them breaking eye contact as the scene devolves around them, oblivious to it all, before the confrontation ends, just as fast as it began, Woods flinches and stands down slowly, as does Silver in response\]

""Keep your nose out of my business *mutt,* and I'll leave you alone""

""Fine, *Kitty* just keep your nip and your claws to yourself""

\[Woods walks away, as does Silver a few moments later, once Woods leaves his sight, people who were hiding or had climbed slowly emerge, and clamber down from on top of bookshelves and from under sofas, the residual fear slowly fading\]

\[back in his dorm room, Silver sits, Jake leaning over his shoulder as they read a copy someone had left in the dorm lounge\]

\[Silver jesures with a frown\] ""What a bunch of nonsense, seriously, who wrote this, none of them know what's happening and thare just throwing around random speculations""

\[Jake leans in closer\] ""Yeah, especially that guy, seriously, he thinks you would have lost to that scrawny..."" \[he stops his eyes fixating on one of the pictures from the fight, a clearer shot from a different angle, moments after they had crashed through the table and had each other in a grapple\], ""scrawny... cat""

\[Silver looks sideways, towards Jake\] ""Hmmm?""

\[Jake nods\] ""that grapple looks kinda nasty,.. You gotta go for the wrist, not the chest, gotta contain the claws, not the teeth when it comes to cats... Anyway, I just remembered I gotta make a work call back in a moment, need to see if they still need me to cover""

\[He walks off to thare room, leaving Silver alone with a perplexed expression. His contemplation is cut short as the paper is smacked out of his hand. Stood in front of him a crumpled copy of the same paper, clutched in her other hand, stands a disgruntled-looking Aloe\]

""We need to talk about this garbage. I know I shouldn't have provoked them. I thought they would back off, but now they are planning to make another one! About the fight you *just* had in the west side lounge, which is just making it worse, so you are going to help me put a stop to it now!""

\[before he can respond, she turns and marches away, leaving Silver sitting for a moment, his face switching from annoyance to grief, to anger, and then back to calm as he stands to follow her, the other wolves in the doorm lounge watch on in confusion and bemusement...\]

But at home, we would always just be super kind and supportive to each other and always got each others back, no matter what! ( our algorithm would be to always fight the problem, with the help of a cheesecake or two 😅 )

I also love playing sports and would love a doubles partner, so that everyday we play another sport or even go for dance classes together 🙈

I am super laid back, flexible and always open to trying out new things ( my past few weekends included pottery, coffee making, embroidery and ancient book hunting ! )

I would love for our home to be filled with silly laughter and always smelling like freshly baked cookies, where every weekend , our friends would come over for BBQ and board games.😇",1,1758827419.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

Sometimes life feels like it’s just too heavy.
Maybe your business is struggling, you’ve lost a job, your marriage is breaking, you’re sick, or just tired of trying.

When life throws these moments, it feels like you’re being pushed off the road.

Your mind goes into survival mode. Fear, worry, and anxiety take over.

I’ve been here so many times, and I know more will come, because that’s part of growth.

But I have found ways to anchor myself.

Here is what I do:

I do this prayer:

""  My dear God, thank you for the gift of life, for this body, for the air I breathe, and for the chance to see this day.

You knew me before I was born. You know where I am going, even when I don’t.

Today I align with your plan and purpose.

 Everything I need will come at the right time. I am taken care of, provided for, and protected by you.

I do this in a quiet place, where I can see the sky, trees, or a river.

I speak these words out loud and let them sink in.

I cry if I need to cry. I let the emotions move through me.

Slowly, I start to feel lighter. Ideas begin to flow. I get my courage back.

This is how I come back to myself.

How do you anchor yourself when life is too much?

(If this post made you pause and breathe, you can support my work by buying me a coffee ☕ — it helps me keep sharing free reflections like this for others who feel stuck too.)

I’m not here for romance or flings, just friendships built on respect, kindness, and a bit of sarcasm.

I gave birth to our daughter three days ago. During labor, my ex showed up at the hospital. He'd heard through mutual friends that I was having the baby. We dated for seven years before I met my husband, and yeah, we had a messy breakup. But he said he wanted to apologize for how things ended between us.

My husband stepped out to get coffee when my ex arrived. The nurses assumed he was the father since he was holding my hand during a contraction. When they asked who should cut the cord, I was delirious from pain meds and exhaustion. I said ""let him do it, he's been waiting longer.""

I meant my husband had been waiting longer for this moment. But my ex grabbed the scissors.

The look on my husband's face when he walked back in will haunt me forever. His coffee cup hit the floor. The nurse was handing our newborn daughter to my ex, who was crying and calling her beautiful.

""What the fuck is happening?"" my husband said.

""I'm sorry,"" my ex said, trying to hand him the baby. ""She asked me to, I thought...""

""Get out,"" my husband said. ""Now.""

The nurses made my ex leave but the damage was done. My husband held our daughter for maybe five minutes before putting her in the bassinet.

""I need some air,"" he said.

That was the last time I saw him before his lawyer showed up.

While he was gone, I panicked. I called his mother, his sister, his best friend. I told them he'd abandoned me and the baby at the hospital because he was jealous of my ex. I said he was being controlling and irrational, that he couldn't handle me having a past.

His mother called him a disappointment. His sister said she was disgusted. His best friend said he'd lost all respect for him.

What I didn't mention was the text I'd sent my ex the week before. ""I wish this was yours.""

My husband found it when he borrowed my phone two days ago to call the doctor. He never said anything. Just screenshots showing he'd forwarded it to his lawyer.

His divorce filing includes abandonment of parental rights. Full custody to me. No visitation requested. The papers say ""petitioner believes child will be better served by relationship with biological mother's preferred partner.""

His family won't return my calls now. They know about the text. His sister sent me one message: ""You got what you wanted.""

My ex hasn't contacted me since the hospital. I texted him that my husband left and asked if we could talk. Read but no response.

I'm alone with a newborn in this recovery room. The nurse keeps asking if anyone's coming to take us home. I've been saying my husband's parking the car for two days.

My mom flew in this morning. First thing she said was, ""You always did love that ex of yours too much.""

I destroyed my marriage for a man who won't even text back. My husband signed away his daughter because I made him believe he was second choice. Maybe he was.

Am I wrong for still hoping my ex will come back? Or am I exactly the asshole everyone thinks I am?

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1758826838.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

A lot of machines I’ve tried in the past seem to brew at a temperature that’s just “okay,” but by the time I add a splash of milk or leave it sitting for a few minutes, it’s already too cool.

Part of this is because of my mornings. I get up at 5 a.m. for work and I don’t always have time to drink my coffee right away. Sometimes I brew a pot and it sits while I get ready. If the machine doesn’t brew hot enough, it feels like I’m drinking stale warm coffee instead of something that wakes me up. I’ve even tried using thermal carafes, but the starting temperature just isn’t high enough in the first place.

So my question is, which coffee makers actually brew the hottest coffee? I don’t care if it’s a fancy machine or a simple drip brewer, I just want something that consistently comes out hot enough to stay enjoyable. Any recommendations from people who also prefer their coffee piping hot?",1,1758826733.0,HomeGear,0,1.0,False
1nqfcfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/saturdaynightlive/comments/1nqfcfa/best_ever_snl_songs/,Best Ever SNL Song(s)?,"I'm curious about everyone else's opinion, but I think 2 of the best songs they ever did were ""Wishin Boot"" (feat. Aidy, Kate, & host Blake Shelton) and ""Christmas Candle"" (feat., again, Andy, Kate, then host Emma Stone)

**""Wishin Boot""** is already funny as-is, but the attention to detail is WILD. Kate is obviously supposed to be some sort of Reba McEntire-type. Aidy? Clearly Wynonna Judd. Blake is clearly supposed to be like Alan Jackson. Then there are the tacky-ass outfits (Aidy's little ankle boots are hilarious) Kate is in that early-2000s ~ethereal~ mom outfit lol. The way she's dancing in it, the way she points to the air, it's... You have to see it. 

The boot is deified in a way, so it takes the worst (best lol) parts of country music: cowboy boots & Jesus or some sort of savior. The fact Kate says at the end (as an aside) *""We're gonna make so much [beep] money off of this...""* is WILDLY accurate. Not only are Country music listeners the last group to actually buy physical copies of music (not including vinyl nerds) but because anything even mildly Christ-y is going to immediately sell. It's... It's just amazing. If you haven't seen it, you absolutely need to. 

**""The Christmas Candle""** immediately opens in a hilarious way. They are absolutely DECKED OUT in a very specific early-90s style. The perms, the crunchy curls, the giant feathered bangs, baggy sweaters and FRENCH TIP NAILS?? Omg. It takes you back (Vanessa Bayer's vest & Sasheer Zamata's tacky sweatshirt? Chef's kiss.) 

The candle song may not be as universally funny, because it seems to be more of a woman (""and most gays"") problem. But having an entire song dedicated to THAT candle that is simultaneously a terrible gift AND a convenient last-minute re-gift? It's such a universal experience 😅 The acting is *sublime.* The singing, the fact is is SO DRAMATIC. Ugh. They nailed it. It's one of those rare ""perfect"" SNL songs. No cheesiness, no outdated references and/or slang, just greatness lol. 

I realize this was long AF, but I genuinely want to see what anyone else brings & why they love it so much. As far as sketches go, I always seem to go back to ""Schmitt's Gay"" or ""Coffee Crystals"" —both pre-recorded and have Chris Farley, so you kinda can't miss... But the songs always seem to get swept under the rug 🤷🏻‍♀️

She says “I have a hard time seeing marriage”.,"Me 24 and my (ex)gf 23 have been together for 3.5 years and I can honestly say we had a super healthy relationship. We both are into the same things(gym, our faith, foodies, hiking, etc). Well got together 6 months after we both got out of our high school relationships(just kinda happened we both wernt looking for anything). We have a very open communication relationship where we say things even if they will hurt and her reason for breaking up is “not sure if she sees marriage”. I asked her if she had fallen out of love, if she’s wanting to see other people, if our sex life is the issue, if there’s things I don’t do for her and none of those are the issue. The sole issue is not sure if she “sees a future”. We stayed together for a few months trying to fix that feeling with no improvement. She says if she could change the feeling she absolutely would. I’m just trying to see what to do next. We both are very much in love and are having an extremely hard time with this. We just met up and got coffee and we’re both emotional about it all. We aren’t closed off to at some point getting back together if it felt right. I just don’t really know where to go from here. Especially when there is no reason that led to it, just a feeling that she doesn’t see marriage. For me when I have a feeling something made me feel that way. For her in this situation she says ”it’s a gut feeling I’ve had for a little while, but nothing is causing it”. She also said she’s “confused about why she’s feeling this way when we have such a great relationship”. I believe everything she’s saying, and i genuinely believe that she is confused on why she’s feeling this way. I’m obviously gonna work on myself individually, but I also want to put myself in a position to be with her if she figure her stuff out. If you saw how we are as a couple you would probably be very surprised that we are in this situation. Anyone who knows us is very shocked at the news.

1nqf3ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMeAnythingIAnswer/comments/1nqf3ww/i_pay_for_sex_in_se_asia_because_i_dont_want_to/,I pay for sex in SE Asia because I don't want to date AMA,"I am posting this because I don't care about social interaction but I still like being understood. 

The TLDR Verison, Im autisitic, I don't enjoy being around other people and don't feel a need too. However I still want sex so I pay for it. 

Anyways here's the stroy. 

Right now im 28 and ive been doing this since I was 23. I just don't want to date people. When I was younger I though I did but I only wanted to date people because I was trying to be normal. I was masking because Im autistic. To me, part of masking was finding someone to be in a relationship with. I was trying to be ""Normal"" SpongeBob pretty muh. Im able to interact with normal people, go to bars and pick up women but doing it just takes SOOO much energy that I just pref not too. Not only that but I also hate the loudness of bars and clubs, the stickness, and the drunk people. So I pref to just avoid it. Then covid hit and unlike everyone else, I wasn't hit with a big need to interact. I actully noticed my type of autism is the type where I can be left alone for years and be competely okay without interacting with people. All I needed was knitting needles, baking and coffee and I was happy. 

But I still wanted sex. Jacking off isn't the same. I actully don't like jacking off. I just like fucking. So one day after a year without sex or social interaction I decided to try a Asian massage place. I got more than a happy ending and I enjoyed it. There was no kissing no mind games. Just sex. We both got cleaned up and went on with our lives. I got checked for STD the next week and nothing. Which is funny because all the times I picked women up from the bar, a place seen as safe and clean when thinking of STD's, I got something. Curable but still annoying that I got it. While the sex worker wasn't offended that I asked to use a condom. 

Not also that there was no games or annoying bullshit either. No one stealing my clothes, my hoodies, no emotional manipulation. No arguments. Just peace and I haven't felt that with other people.  The friends I have meet told me the same thing. That dating sucks. Everyone I talk to right now IRL say the same thing. Dating is terrible. No want wants to work things out they just want to argue. 

So I said fuck it and gave up. Then after I did that, I noticed I was saving a lot more money. I wasn't spending it on women but since I didn't care what anyone said about me (in a loss sense) I stopped wasting money on things. The only things I got were clothes that fit and looked just ""okay"" yarn, and subscriptions. I used that money, saved it and went to Vietnam and Thailand. A friend of mine meet a vietnam woman online, went to Vietnam and they hit it off. He's living the expat dream. And he isn't the type to buy sex. But he doesnt judge. So for his party before he got married we went to Thailand just to eat food. And that's all we did was eat, drink beer and play videogames. Then I asked him, ""hey you mind if I leave and get a massage?"" he didn't care so that's exactly what I did. I went back to my hotel room, order a massage and had sex.  Then after, something in my head told me, you know what I already had sex, instead of risking it with other girls I should just ask for her. And that's what I did. I asked for number, she gave it to me. And 3 times I asked for her. 

After his party, we went to Vietnam and we did the wedding then I went home, got checked, nothing, and that was that. That's when I had the idea of doing what im doing now. I downloaded a dating app and I was just direct with women about what I wanted. And Yeah I ran into some scammers but I never sent anyone money. A few months after the wedding I saved up again and I went to Thailand by myself. And I just did the same thing I did before. I got a massage, but this time I asked if they were okay getting STD checked, cuz I was scared of getting STD. And a lot said no but One woman said yeah. I paid for it. We both cleared and we did it. So I asked for her number. And for the next two week she ended up staying with me, we would fuck, I would pay for her meals and I got her her own hotel room but she pretty much just slept with me cuz we were already fucking anyways and that's all we did. We would just eat, fuck and sometimes talk. 

We talked and she told me she wasnt doing what she was doing for very long. She admitted to taking a few people, I didn't care. She was clean and she felt good that's all that mattered to me. But I was worried she might get STD laters so I asked her, ""Hey you just wanna fuck me?"" Cuz Ive been in Thailand twice. I got the vibe of the place. I got the price figured out. Me as a forigner, I should never expect to live off 500$ USD a month. But her? Yeah she can easily. So I paid her 500$ USD a month, to do nothing. Then I got back to Thailand 6 months later, I stayed for a month, we fucked for month and we lived like roommates in a hotel and we just had sex. Then after a month passed I thought it was stupid to pay her 500$ ever month so I just gave her 3000$ USD after the month we fucked so she wouldn't have to fuck other men for money making sure she stays STD free. And ever year, everythings the same, we get std checked, it clears we fuck like rabbits. 

When Im at home, I don't talk to anyone. Im alone. Im Happy. All I do is watch anime, knite, crochet and work. I don't enjoy soicalizing. I don't enjoy jokes. I don't enjoy a lot of ""normal"" stuff other people like. And What I noticed is people can't live like that. Normal people need human interaction. They need to make stupid jokes, they need to insult each other to be ""friends"" and it's just all stuff I don't like. 

People think im cold, and rude and childish and should go to therapy. That's how the world sees me. Well I do go to therapy and I learned im not Rude, Cold or childish that's just how THEY see me because they aren't willing to get to know me. And I don't care to get to know other people. Autistic people are seen this way, not just me but many autistic people. Not all autistic people choose to just isolation themselves but I do. And im happy with life like this. So now twice a year I take a month off from work, go to Thailand, fuck like a rabbit to someone who understands im weird but doesn't judge me for it. Then I go home. And It's the best thing for both of us. 

People often say ""oh im using her"". Dude, I give her 6 months worth of living pay and im gone for 5 to 6 months. If she wants to find another job she easily could. She has her reasons for doing it. She doesn't want to get married because she feels like she will be a house wife and she doesn't want that. So it just works out for both of us. 

I can answer anything about me, the women im fucking in Thailand keeps things private. I mean she's a sex worker so its understandable. So all im really willing to say abot her is shes a big titty Thai woman.

When I went to the dermatologist, my thought was to ask for oral monoxidil. I have ADHD so a pill next to my coffee machine is much easier for me to be consistent with. She strongly recommended topical, to a point that it felt important, and she said I should do it in the morning which honestly is easier to remember than nights.

However, the faff of having to dry my hair, apply the liquid, and then wait 20-30 min after before styling is really obnoxious. Plus, while it hasn’t made my hair awfully greasy, it definitely doesn’t look FRESH after a wash, dry, and application (I’d say it looks like Day 2 hair on a wash day where Day 3 is “so greasy you can’t go in public”). 

If this was a temporary thing, I’d just deal with it. But the thought of this being the rest of my life feels awful. Do you get used to this? Does the light greasiness get better over time?

1nqf2q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1nqf2q2/need_advice_struggling_with_intimacy_and/,Need advice: struggling with intimacy and connection after 8 years of marriage,"Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh,

I (M35) have been married to my wife (F35) for almost 8 years. Alhamdulillah, we have two children, a 7 year old son and a baby daughter born 6 months ago.

From the start, intimacy has been a tension point. I had hopes of being close 3–4 times a week, but for my wife once a week (or even less) feels enough. She says if I initiate she won’t say no, but she rarely feels the need herself. Over time, I built resentment because I wish she would also initiate or at least show enthusiasm instead of it feeling like a chore. At one point I thought maybe she isn’t physically attracted to me, but she insists that is not the case and that she was attracted and even pursued marriage with me.

Even in the early years, when I did these things more often, intimacy was still less. For example, we went on a honeymoon to our favorite country for 5 days, and I expected closeness every day. Instead there was nothing for 4 days, and on the last day I got angry. Things have become worse after the birth of our daughter. Weeks can pass without intimacy, I get upset and distant, and then we fight. In our last two arguments she said she is tired of this topic and that I make her feel like a failure as a wife. I admit I have also said some harsh things, like feeling I’ve wasted my youth without the intimacy I imagined marriage would bring. She then said she doesn’t feel an emotional connection anymore and that I don’t make her happy, though I felt she said that more out of spite.

I work over 40 hours a week in a stressful field. She works part-time from home, and some weeks I even do her tasks for her job. When I have lighter weeks, I try to help at home like ironing my own clothes, loading/unloading the dishwasher, helping with kids. I always do the outside tasks like school runs, family appointments, taking the kids out. I used to cook and bake, but with work stress I haven’t been able to do that in the past few years, which I think caused some resentment. I’ve also provided modern conveniences like dishwasher and washer, and even offered to hire house help. But whenever I express my needs, she feels I don’t appreciate her efforts.

Recently she said if I want intimacy more often, then I should do “something extra” for her every day or every other day. I asked for specific examples I can practically do, and she said things that show care like a hug, making coffee, cooking her favorite food, bringing flowers, or chocolates. I do these things sometimes, but I don’t think it’s realistic to keep that up at the same frequency as my needs. I don’t go shopping every day, sometimes I come home late from work and exhausted, and I just want to spend time with the kids. I already pay all the bills, rent, work long hours, and spend time with the kids, with no hobbies or social life of my own.

Another complaint she throws back at me is that she is still traumatized by things from my family in the early years of marriage. I always took her side, protected her, and supported her even against my own family. Those things are in the past, but she is still holding on to them and using them to justify neglect towards me, even though I always supported her. 

Right now we are not speaking. I even avoid eating her food. I asked her to give me a practical way to meet her expectations that could also spark intimacy in her. She has in the past suggested maybe seeing a doctor about hormones or going for couples counseling. I do not want to go to a non-muslim counseller. We live in a non-muslim country. And I think a muslim scholar would suggest me to have a second wife. I have thought about supporting a second wife (someone in need of a husband) to be in a halal relationaship but, practically, I find it difficult as I do not wish to split my time between multiple families and I live in a country where it is not legal. 

I find it offensive for my wife to expect me to do somethings extra everytime i expect to have peace and relief from my halal partner. i feel like I am performaing my religous obligations. Is it fair for her to ask of this? 

My questions to you, brothers and sisters:

* How can I rebuild both emotional and physical intimacy in this situation?
* How do I balance expressing my needs without making her feel inadequate?
* Are there Islamic perspectives, counseling resources, or practical steps that helped you in similar circumstances?

The problem is when certain people that see me try to change the subject after giving a generic answer about a medical condition, still decide to be *very* curious about it.  
It's fine in some scenarios I guess, I don't always mind! But if I'm on lunch break, or talking to someone else, or just generally not in the mood to think about fibro, especially in front of a group of people, *and* clearly, repeatedly changing the subject to something else, why do some people not get the hint? 

I try not to be too much of an asshole, so I end up giving in more often than not.  
It also makes me feel like I'm kind of a downer, no? ""Yeah, let me list the kind of pains I'm in while we're all having a cup of coffee, so you can feel sorry for me. Wonderful mood we've created here.""

I brought my crutch during an exam session for the first time this week and it was particularly awful. I had a classmate get frustrated because she couldn't understand the meaning of ""chronic"", insisting it doesn't mean it's long term, and that I could ditch the crutch soon (?).  
Another one asked me a few too many times to try the crutch. We're in our mid 20s. I don't know this person that well. What the hell? I worked with small children before and they've much more respectful.

Even weirder, these specific people at uni have seen me limping/in pain for 3 whole years now, and were always vocal about it. They already knew the answer, so the extra questions were... okay? I guess you're the only person to actually notice/remember how much pain you've been in.

I don't want my mobility aid to always be a conversation piece. Sometimes I wish they were invisible.  
I don't know, maybe it depends on the area. I feel like people just have less experience with other people here, it's a small city. I guess?

  
On a brighter note, does anybody have some creative suggestions on what I could say next time I don't want to talk about it? I'm running out of ""it's complicated""s and ""it's nothing \[subject change\]""s.",6,1758825990.0,Fibromyalgia,13,0.88,False

I'd like to join a book club, but after looking through this sub/Meetup I didn't find quite what I was looking for. If two or three people are interested, I think it would be fun to start up a small one freshly catered to the people in it?

Mainly the vibes I'm fishing for:

Content: Mostly Historical/non-fic(love a memoir or science-y in a readable way). Vague intent is to stave some of my brainrot away by actually learning things in my free time, but if a book is too dry I will not finish it. Open to classics too as I feel those almost always bring some historical context/implications with them that could be fun to discuss

* Examples I'd like to read:
   * World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig: Memoir set in Pre-WW1 europe
   * Northanger Abbey, Jane Austen: idk a jane austen I haven't read
   * The Pillow Book, Sei Shonagon: Collection of essays a and lists (!) from courtesan in 1000 CE Heian-period Japan
   * The Lives of the Caesars, Suetonius (Tom Holland Translation): What it sounds like, idk how good it'll be but could get some good cultural relativism moments from ""seeing the world through the eyes of a roman"" or whatever. Something something the classical education of it all
   * Empire of Pain, Patrick Keefe: 2021 pub about the Sackler family and their role in the opiod crisis
   * My Early Life, Winston Church: Autobiography written before WW2, which is interesting. I'm sure plenty of condemnable imperialist views will seep through, but idk something something I think it's important to face realities of how people you might not necessarily agree with think/were shaped by their environments, something something I've heard he's actually kind of a funny writer and I want to see what that looks like
   * The Golden Spruce, John Vaillant: 2005 pub of 1997 incident covering the chopping down of a Sacred Golden Spruce in British Colombia. Heard it's vaguely true-crimey w/ some environmentalist themes
   * Brigham Young: Pioneer Prophet, John G Turner: Non-morm/exmorm affiliated Professor's Biography of BY, could be dry but also like, he's was a guy who was up to stuff & I live here so you'd hope it can't be that bad.

Location: I live in sugarhouse and enjoy walking places so it'd be nice to be in that area- but open to thoughts

Activity: Again open to thoughts but maybe every 2-4 weeks depending on book length?

Setting: up to and including: bar, coffee shop, park, on a walk, my porch w/ beers, etc. Bar might be the silliest for me personally but open to group preference

If you'd like to join just comment and I'll follow up with a discord link or something based on interest. Thanks for your time!

P.S: I am an occasional ""Girl Historians"", ""The Rest is History"", and ""Hardcore History"" listener if that gives you pertinent information about my taste- for better or for worse lol

The Legend Unfolds - Kanto
Chapter 1 - The Boulder

I, Nautilus_Prime, start my adventure by meeting with the Pokémon Professor himself, Professor Oak. He welcomes me, and tells me of the wonderful world of Pokémon. Then, right in the middle of my orientation, we suddenly find ourselves ambushed by three frightened, yet adorable, Pokémon. Even though I've never seen them before, they somehow feel familiar to me, as though we were old friends. Perhaps in another life, we truly were. 

The amazing Professor Oak declares he can only battle two of them at once, leaving me to choose which of the three I wish to challenge. After much debate, I chose the one that felt most familiar to me. Almost as soon as it began, the confrontation was over, and I had captured my first Pokémon. After the strain of battling my very first Pokémon with my own fingertips, I decided that, from here on in, my Pokémon would fight the rest of my battles for me.

The Professor and I regroup. After praising my success, he hands me a few Key Items, as well as a few beginner's quests to start me on my journey. As I take my first few steps onto Route 1, I was startled yet again by another Pokemon. Well, Starter1.0 made pretty quick work of it and we caught ourselves a Pidgey. A few battles later, we added a Rattata to the team. That's when old Oak handed me a Town Map, helping me to learn how to navigate these new areas. Before I could make it to the next route, all three of my team members evolved, so I caught me another Pidgey and Rattata to fill out the team a bit more. I wonder when I'll see more Starters running around in the wild...

I finally make my way off of Route 1 and find myself in Viridian City. There's a Poké Mart and an Old Man, but not much else seems accessible at the moment. The Poké Mart had some of the bare necessities. The Old Man, however, had nothing to offer me but disdain for my presence. Maybe I'll try again later after he's had his coffee. Professor Oak's next quest for me was to head north to Route 2. So, I did the sensible thing and headed west to Route 22 instead.

My first encounter was a Spearow, but it flew away before I could capture it. Not Mankey, though. I caught that Mankey first try. While Starter1.1 was fighting off another Spearow for me to catch, I finally decided to check out my Trainer Profile card that I had received from Professor Oak at the onset. Silly man had the wrong picture of me on the card, and he hadn't even bothered to put down my proper name. I spent a few seconds figuring how I wanted to customize my ID. After it was all set, that Spearow was ready for a Poké Ball. Got 'em. I noticed a man out here start yelling at me. Something about being his Rival, but I paid him no mind for now.

With Route 22 explored, I finally decided to heed the Professor's request and head north of Viridian to Route 2. Now, we've found some bug Pokémon, so my Spearow went and gained himself enough experience to evolve into Fearow. My team sure is growing fast. I think it's neat that I'm not limited to carrying only six Pokémon like most all of these other folks. Lots of Caterpie and Weedle on this route, so I hang around long enough to see them evolve a few times and recapture them until I had a complete set. This sure is a lot of fun so far, but I feel like I forgot something back home...

MOM! I hurry back home as fast as I could. I can't believe I forgot to say bye to my own Mom. Luckily, she hadn't even realized I had already started my journey. She gave me some encouraging words of wisdom for my travels. She was saying something about talking to everyone I meet, as there's all sorts of nice people everywhere. I couldn't help but think back to the cranky Old Man and my Rival yelling at me. People don't seem too nice so far, but I think she's probably right. As I start to make my way back north to Viridian City, I take stock of my supplies and find I'm not very good at throwing Poké Balls. I seem to have missed quite a few throws when attempting some catches, so I better buy some more when I get to Viridian.

After restocking some Poké Balls, the Old Man hollered out to me as I was leaving the Mart. Before I knew it, he was skipping right on over my way, cheery as could be. Surely, this couldn't possibly be the same Old Man I saw before. What was in that coffee he drank? After only a few, short seconds, he was happily sharing with me all that he knew about how to catch Pokémon. Seems the Old Man knows quite a bit, and he even showed me some useful tricks to better target specific Pokémon. After some time, I express my appreciation to him, and I head on my way.

After completing a couple more quests for Professor Oak, I finally had enough Quest Points to purchase the Dungeon Ticket from the Viridian City Poké Mart. As I walk past Route 22 again, I catch a glimpse of my Rival, glancing at his watch impatiently. Seems he's still waiting around for me. I turn towards him, but then I start to think about how strong he may be. I better see if I can find any additional power for the team in the Viridian Forest. Then I'd feel a bit more comfortable taking him on.

As I make my way through the natural maze of the Viridian Forest, I'm greeted by some other friendly Trainers like myself. A few trainer battles here, some wild bug Pokémon encounters there, and a splash of loot boxes with berries and some other items I'll never use. What the heck is an X Attack anyway? I'll never know. As I reach the end of the forest maze, I finally saw it... a Pikachu. I had heard that there might be a few scurrying around these parts, but they're normally a rare sight to see. My Pokémon manage to weaken it, and the Old Man's catching tips echoed in my head. I threw my Poké Ball, and this time my aim was true. Pikachu was added to the team. All that's left now is for a little bit of experience training, and then a Rival battle.

And so with all of the Pokémon I could find between home and the Viridian Forest, I was ready to battle my Rival. He leads with a Pidgey, but without its Sand-Attack it was an easy KO. Then, to my surprise, I see him send out one of the two other Starters from before. You know, from the ones that Professor Oak had battled. And just my luck... his starter has a natural type advantage over mine. The team and I came too far (well, relatively speaking) to lose this first Rival battle. We threw all we could muster, and it's a good thing too because we walked away victorious.

Turns out, the kid's name is Blue, and he's got his eyes set on the Pokémon League. Doesn't seem to be that easy to get into, so he hurries away to start working toward his goals. I decided to give chase and make my way to Pewter City. Once I arrived, I head straight to the gym. Starter1.1, the Caterpie line, the Weedle line, Pidgey and Pidgeotto, Rattata and Raticate, Spearow and Fearow, Pikachu, and Mankey... fifteen members in the team so far, and it seems the Pewter City Gym leader, Brock, is in my way to catch more.
Let's do it.

Brock is a rock-type specialist, which checks out given it's in his name. He starts out with Geodude, and I decide to send all fifteen of my Pokémon out at the same time. Even outnumbered 15 to 1, Geodude still held its own better than you'd've thought. But when Brock sent out his Onix, it became a true endurance test for my team. It seemed my team was only seconds away from throwing in the towel, but my Mankey and Starter1.1 clutched out the win with their type advantage. The battle was over, and the Boulder Badge... was mine.",4,1758825650.0,PokeClicker,0,1.0,False

Canadians hate the fact that they’re going to have to walk 10 to 15 minutes to their boring community mailbox. Well, out of that, I see an opportunity.

When I was growing up, going to the post office was fun. There was a coffee shop next door. Everybody went, grabbed their coffee, hung out at the door until the post office opened, went in and grabbed their Canadian Tire Flyers, stood around in a circle drinking their coffee, and talking about what a great price that vacuum cleaner was — even though nobody in that room actually needed to buy a vacuum cleaner.

Let’s make that happen for all Canadians. Nationalize our coffee consumption. Visit the Canada Post Café and grab your Double-Double and your Boston Cream for under $5.

And instead of a stamp on a loyalty card, you get an actual, real Canadian stamp. One visit equals one domestic stamp. Five visits gets you an international stamp. And on your 25th visit, you get one free Priority Post envelope.

1nqetwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1nqetwi/bring_micro_center_to_nashville/,Bring Micro Center to Nashville,"Bring Micro Center to Nashville...

HEre is why in three strong reasons why Micro Center (the tech / electronics retailer) should consider opening a location in Nashville:

1. Untapped Market Demand & Strategic Reach
Tech Enthusiast Population: Nashville is growing fast, with a rising community of gamers, content creators, makers, students, and IT professionals who often prefer hands-on shopping for components, hands-on help, and in-store services that Micro Center is known for.

Regional Gap in Specialty Retail: While big box electronics stores exist, few (if any) offer the depth of parts, custom PC building, specialty components, and repair services that Micro Center does. Being the “go-to” local resource gives a competitive edge.

Anchor for Expansion in the Southeast: Nashville’s location is well positioned to serve a broader regional market (Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, parts of Kentucky). A store there could become a hub in Micro Center’s Southeast footprint.

2. Economic & Community Benefits (a win-win for Micro Center and Nashville)

Job Creation & Tax Revenue: Opening a new store involves hiring sales, technical, operations, and support staff. The store also pays property taxes, sales taxes, and contributes to local government revenues.

Multiplier Effect: Local spending by employees and customers can bolster nearby restaurants, coffee shops, and other retail—strengthening the local ecosystem. 

Community & Educational Engagement: Micro Center can partner with local schools, tech incubators, maker spaces, and colleges to host workshops, sponsor competitions, or provide access to equipment. That builds brand loyalty and fosters the next generation of technologists in Nashville.

3. Differentiated Brand & Customer Experience Hands-on Experience & Expert Help: One of Micro Center’s distinguishing features is that customers can touch components, test gear, get help from knowledgeable staff, and even see repairs. That experience is hard to replicate online.

Service & Repair Capability: Many consumers hesitate to buy high-end or niche components if there’s no nearby place to get help, warranties serviced, or troubleshooting done. A local Micro Center lowers that barrier.

Innovation & Momentum in Retail: Even while many retailers are pulling back physical presence, Micro Center is expanding—e.g. new stores in Phoenix, Charlotte, Miami, and others.

Micro Center Nashville would fit that trajectory of growth into emerging metros.

**Nora**

The apartment reeked of someone else’s life—old carpet, stained walls, the lingering trace of garlic in the cupboards. But it was theirs now. She'd filled it with boxes, hers and Jamie's, from their lives pre-divorce. Each box unpacked, the dishes her mother had gifted, Jamie’s baby shoes, her albums full of their old lives, reminded her why they’d come.

Outside, snow blanketed the sidewalk, erasing the city's grime. Across the street, the old firehall, a community centre now, stood guard. Its windows glowed with life during the day. Even now, though the city slept, the upstairs window stayed lit.

He stood in that window, watching, a pencil in one hand, sketch pad in the other. She caught his eye. He nodded, but didn't smile.

Jamie visited the firehall the second day. “Gotta check it out,” he said. “They’re doing something for Gaza. Posters and stuff.” He hopped about, imitating a dance move from YouTube. “Maybe a protest march. That would be so cool.”

Protests were dangerous. She wanted to warn him away, but she didn’t want to be a smothering mother. He was on his way to becoming a man, and she refused to hold him back.

He disappeared through the side door, beyond her sight. Her eyes flicked up to the window across the street. The man stood, still and silent, watching her. He raised a hand, holding a coffee mug—in greeting or invitation, she wasn't sure.

**Liam**

His eyes followed Shirrin as she organized the protestors, handing out blank posters, markers and the wooden posts to mount them on. Following her movements was a ritual now, borne of a love they'd shared too many years ago. She'd moved on to a life of politics and stability—until Gaza. The atrocities happening daily on the other side of the planet had renewed the activism spark she'd buried when she'd left him. And brought her here, to his turf, to this haven for the discontented and the hopeful.

He no longer believed chants and banners would change the world but he couldn't let go—because she was here. She didn't recognize him, or pretended not to. So he kept the lights on. Fixed the furnace. Scrubbed graffiti off the side wall and painted murals in its place. And stayed hidden from view.

Until the woman across the way caught his eye. Nora.

Her son, Jamie, was all fire, raw and twitchy, reminding him of the hunger for justice he'd once believed in. The kid would be easily led but he trusted Shirrin to guide him.

A knock, soft, tentative. The woman from the window, the kid's mother, stood outside, coffee mug in hand. “I thought it was time to say hello,” she said, her eyes clear but guarded.

He liked her immediately. ""Come in."" He held the door open. She slid past him. ""I can offer you toast, if that suits?""

She nodded. They sat, ate rye toast coated in peanut butter and jelly. Talked about pipes and murals and what it meant to care about something when cameras were absent.

""I saw the wall painting of the sparrows,"" she said. ""You drew that?""

""With left over paint."" A blush crept up his neck. ""To cover graffiti.""

She smiled. ""Well, it's beautiful.""

**Nora**

Jamie came home, buzzing. ""My sign's on Instagram,” he said, holding it out for her to read. “It’s getting likes.”

*Kids Deserve to Live.* She read the words, in his unrestrained printing, and remembered the food drive he'd organized when he was ten, and socks-for-the-homeless, last year. 

“I’m proud of you,” she said, and pulled him in for a hug. Jaime believed in people and causes and justice. She'd never believed in anything, or anyone, except Jamie. Maybe that's why her marriage fizzled.

When Jamie buried himself in his tablet, she grew restless. So she crossed the street again, and found Liam upstairs, sketching.

She roamed the room, studying his art. Pictures of a woman—familiar, Arabic, beautiful—covered his walls. “You love her?” she asked, studying him.

He shrugged. ""I used to.""

“Not now? She's the woman downstairs, isn't she? The one organizing the protests.""

""She is. Shirrin."" He hesitated. “But no, I don't love her anymore. She's—a memory now—resurfaced. More a habit than anything else.” He glanced away. ""I used to share her passion for causes."" He looked back, eyes hooded. ""I don't anymore.""

“My son does. It scares me.”

He poured more coffee. ""Jamie will be fine. Shirrin won't let anything happen to him.""

**Liam**

Once, accidentally, he'd glanced through her window and saw her sleeping. On her couch, one arm slung over her head, a book on her chest, her face smooth, worry-free, peaceful. He'd grabbed his sketch book, drew her as she slept, planned a portrait.

Shirrin was different. The woman he remembered was a restless ball of energy: up at dawn, firing off letters, organizing marches, rallying half the city by lunch—and then doing it all again in the afternoon.

He'd thrived in her orbit, for a while. He'd sketched her, the busy work, the marches, the arrests, his art covering their walls, then piled on tables and chairs—until he kept repeating the scenes. And stopped drawing. 

When he stopped drawing, Shirrin stopped caring. Coincidence?  He didn't know. But he'd been blindsided when it ended, hurting for a long time, like an infected tooth he couldn't pull. No longer.

Now he wanted stillness. Like Nora, who joined him for coffee and quiet chats, who watched her son but let him find his own way, who slept like there was no turmoil in the world.

**Nora**

Jamie was injured at the next protest, pushed down by a pro-Israeli supporter—and a reporter caught it on camera. Her son, the media star, loved the attention.

Nora stormed up to Liam's door, eyes flashing, fists balled. “They shoved him,” she railed. “He’s sixteen.”

He nodded. ""He'll be okay."" He offered her coffee and toast, giving her time to settle. ""I tended him. It was just minor cuts and bruises. He's fine."" He'd fix everything for her if he could, but she and Jamie didn't need fixing, so repairing the latch on her door would have to do.

**Nora**

She'd barely noticed when her husband left. Didn't cry. He'd walked out the door one afternoon and she'd picked up her book, continued reading like it was any other day. But she'd wept today when Jamie came home for the second time with scraped knees, and proudly declared, “I’m not backing down.”

When she stopped crying, she pulled herself together. She wouldn't be the woman who only reacted. She wanted her son to be proud of her. She marched across the street, determined.

Liam opened his door. She brushed past him, edgy. ""I want to help. Be involved. Do something.""

""Protest?"" he asked.

""No. Maybe."" She plopped down on a chair. ""I'm a coward. But Jamie—."" She choked back a sob, swallowed hard. ""He admires Shirrin. You know?""

He did. He'd been Jamie. ""You don't need to be her. You're Jamie's mom. Be you.""

She sniffled. Nodded. ""Still ...""

""Still,"" he agreed, and understood her need. ""How about this. Start small."" He handed her a paintbrush. ""I could use help covering graffiti from yesterday's protest. Are you game?""

**Liam**

They painted over the graffiti—\*Feed the Children—\*together.

Nora bit her lip, focused on careful brushstrokes. Precise, straight, overlapping the bare minimum.

He studied her, drawing her in his mind to paint later.

He grinned for the first time in forever—and dabbed her nose with his brush.

She laughed, splashed his chin with hers, but her strokes loosened. Became stronger, less precise, more playful. And she started to hum, under her breath at first, but then out loud.

He started singing a song from his youth—*Michael Row Your Boat Ashore.* She joined in, delighting him.

That night, he drew the picture from his mind. Nora, painting and laughing, hair up in a messy bun, sleeves pushed up to her elbows, white paint on her nose. 

He taped the sketch on his window for her to see.

And pulled down all the pictures of Shirrin from his walls.

**Nora**

She saw it, in a glance as she passed by her kitchen window. His vision of her, young, joyful, happy, touched her.

She carried her notebook with her when she knocked on his door. “I used to write,” she said, when he glanced at it. ""A long time ago.""

He didn't tell her she saved him—from his memories—from himself. Instead, he painted his feelings into pictures of her and lined his walls with them. When she passed them each time she visited, emotion flickered in her eyes.

Jamie stood taller now. Being a part of something big, of the protests, was turning him into the man she'd hoped he'd become. A man with courage, integrity, and a thirst for justice. All the traits his father lacked. Traits she lacked but wanted to work toward.

And Liam?

He'd save her, helped her look outside herself, to engage. She didn't tell him. Her feelings were too new, too fragile. But she slept with the blinds open. Inviting him to watch her as she watched him.

She began to write again. For him. For herself. About windows. And seeing. About quiet men who paint and the shy women who knock on their doors.",1,1758825459.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We have a very open communication relationship where we say things even if they will hurt and her reason for breaking up is “not sure if she sees marriage”.

The sole issue is not sure if she “sees a future”. We stayed together for a few months trying to fix that feeling with no improvement. She says if she could change the feeling she absolutely would. I’m just trying to see what to do next. We both are very much in love and are having an extremely hard time with this. We just met up and got coffee and we’re both emotional about it all.

After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.

From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.

Only then did he panic.

==============================

In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.

Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

As soon as I got out of the car, several unfamiliar messages came through.

They were from Ximena.

""You heard it, didn’t you? Mr. Henry is going to give me a wedding even grander than yours.""

Reading those words, my heart still clenched.

He had once said that he would only ever step into a wedding hall with me.

But now, the wedding we had been looking forward to for so long had become a tool to placate his little bird.

Seeing that I hadn’t replied, Ximena sent several more photos.

In them, she and Kason were entwined, their intimacy unmistakable.

""Has he ever loved you like this?""

I gave a bitter smile and didn’t respond.

Instead, I saved the chat history and walked into the mansion.

Less than half an hour after I got home, Kason arrived with a large bouquet of roses.

The roses were fragrant, but I could still detect that unique sweetness on him.

Before, he had only carried my scent.

But now, it was no longer mine.

When I pushed him away, Kason looked momentarily stunned but quickly recovered.

He kissed the corner of my mouth, as if coaxing a child, and spoke softly to me for a long time.

In the past, this was how he would calm me down when he made me angry, and I would always forgive him after just a few words.

But this time, I didn’t want to forgive.

Seeing my lack of response, Kason pulled out a red velvet box from his pocket.

""Luisa, look what this is.""

I opened the box to find the royal diamond ring I had wanted for so long.

Back then, Kason had felt guilty for not being able to buy it for me.

But now, seeing the hidden guilt in his eyes, I knew it was just a bribe after his betrayal.

Remembering the promises Kason had made to me, I instinctively looked at him.

""Luisa, I’ve finally given it to you, this ring that belongs only to you.""

""From now on, it’s just you and me, forever.""

My fingers traced the ring, but my heart felt as if it were being torn apart.

Kason, you still remember the promises you made back then, so how could you change your heart now?

With a bitter smile, I took off the ring, but Kason grabbed my hand, his voice urgent.

""Luisa, what are you doing?""

""Don’t you like it anymore?""

A flash of panic crossed Kason’s eyes, but I hid my feelings and spoke calmly.

""Rings are most meaningful when given on the wedding day.""

I saw Kason visibly relax, but my heart ached unbearably.

Once, I had hoped to grow old with you, to spend our lives together.

But now, Kason, we have no future.

He put the ring away, slapping his forehead in frustration.

""It’s my fault for being so impatient, Luisa.""

""But the thought of finally being able to marry you makes me so eager.""

Kason grew more and more excited as he spoke, and in the past, I would have been moved to tears.

But now, I just looked at him calmly, my face expressionless.

Seeing my calm demeanor, a flicker of guilt passed through his eyes, and he was about to say something.

But then his phone lit up, and Kason’s face darkened, only to turn excited the moment he saw the message.

He scrolled through the screen, his Adam’s apple bobbing, a flash of desire in his eyes.

Then he turned off the screen and sighed, feigning regret.

""Luisa, I’m sorry, but something’s come up at the office. I have to go.""

Before I could respond, Kason rushed out, not even grabbing his coat.

I still called out to him, ""Is it really something important?""

He froze at my words, then smiled and said, ""Of course it is. Why would I lie to you? Wait for me, I’ll be back.""

Then he turned and left without hesitation.

I knew he was going to see Ximena.

And I knew he wouldn’t be coming back tonight.

Looking at the empty room, I suddenly laughed.

I had once told him that if he lied to me and I found out, I would leave his world forever.

Kason, since you lied to me.

We’ll never see each other again.",1,1758825381.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I’m a former army Captain, 42, and run and work my butt off pretty well.  Run about 14 miles a week up and down mountain trails and still couldn’t kick this pre-diabetic stuff. 

So I went cold turkey on no dessert, candy, anything where sugar or a form of it is either the first or second ingredient.  I still eat “normal” amounts for myself and not really paying attention to processed food vs actual food, but by cutting out sugar a lot of the processed foods have gone bye bye. 

40 days later I’m down 5 lbs and dropped three inches in the waist band.  So, all that sugar was really turning into fat.  I’ll post again in 80 days for my new A1C level.  

Edit: I should add that I also cut out Dutch Bros medium caramel frozen coffees which I had every morning for a long time.  118 g of sugar and 1100 calories.  And 280 mg of caffeine.  Crazy.  I’ve also cut out caffeine.  ",5,1758825361.0,sugarfree,0,0.86,False

Sorry about the extensive journal, it was a short thru-hike (or maybe, you’re welcome?). 
- Bean Juice, The Deuce Deuce ✌️

##Weather:
Clear the entire trip , hot during the day, warm at night, cold morning in the Kern, warmer than I expected at Guitar Lake at night, didn’t freeze, nice chilly hiking up Whitney, blazing hot back down to the portal. 

##LighterPack:
https://lighterpack.com/r/jmlott

##Favorite gear of this trip:
* Nashville Cutaway 40L frameless pack: so many shoulder strap pockets for water, snacks, phone, gloves, sunscreen, etc. Hip freedom, and customizable. Carried a Bearikade Weekender empty on top using y-strap and $10 bear canister straps. Decided last minute to use x2 500ml soft flasks in additional to a 1.5L smart water bottle, very comfortable, but a little wonky when full, giving me man-booby vibes. 
* Alpha Fleece mid layers: 60gsm Senchi top and 60gsm Magnet Designs bottom, perfect for my 3a hike up Whitney, only needed wind jacket and pants while hanging out on the summit 10m after sunrise. The mix of cool weather, light wind, and the alpha thickness and breathability, I was the perfect temp. 
* Intake nasal dilator. I never knew my septum was 95% deviated until recently. I run faster, sleep better, stopped snoring, etc. Until I get a septoplasty, I wear this thing almost 24/7. KT Tape Pro makes for a good multi-day adhesive option.

##Least Favorite Gear of this Trip:
* Wild Ideas Weekender bear canister. Had to carry that bastard just for Guitar Lake and Trail Crest. I luckily found the Bearikade a fews years ago for 1/4 its price, and can never justify buying a smaller one. I admit, it came in handy to wash my stank-ass shirt/shorts. 

##Food:
* Stoveless! So much time/hassle saved. Just a Talenti jar and a plastic spoon. Daily premade cold soaked protein chia/oats, daily premade cold soaked skurka beans/rice w/ velveeta + chili cheese Fritos, x2 McDoubles (more next time), some leftover pizza, tuna packets, tortillas, skippy PB squeeze, fig bars, Bobo PBJ oat bars, RX AM bars, hazelnut crepes, mini snickers, Aussie bites, PB cheese crackers, carnation instant with coffee, Tailwind and Skratch electrolytes. Likely 4500+ calories a day, idk, constant snacking.

##Day -1, 0, 9/11-9/12
Camped at Azalea for a few days with my wife and homie/hiking partner 'Piss Cocoon' (PC for short). Day hikes/trail runs to all the trees, Moro Rock, etc., plus no showers gives us a lil’ jumpstart on smelling bad. It was chilly and the smoke from the Garnet Fire had started to suddenly creep into SeKi. Ranger at orientation said there had been smoke making its way through the Kaweah Gap and down to the Kern already, but luckily that wouldn’t be the case on our entire hike. He began to list where we could have campfires, we said all good, no campfires for us, we won’t even have stoves. He replied, “Cold-soaking, eh? Dissssssgusting.” Lol.

##Day 1, 9/13:
**Crescent Meadow to Hamilton Lakes, 15.8mi, 3694' gain**

Started wayyyyy late at 9:15a, took trailhead photos and said goodbye to my wife and pup. It was already much warmer compared to the past few days camping at Azalea. 2-4mi in, the flora changed drastically. Felt like a jungle for a while. Had cold soaked protein berry oats under a bridge (Merhten Creek?), singing like trolls. We are both already feeling the frameless pack with 5 days of (likely too much) food, and the bear can (empty) on top. 

A couple big climbs to beautiful Hamilton Lake surrounded on 3 sides by rock walls of Mt Stewart and Eagle Scout Peak, arrived around 4:30p, thought about pushing to Precipice, but instead grabbed spots right next to bear box just west of the lake. Birthday suit dip alone while PC scoped the most epic privy view location. Set up shelter and smashed our skurka beans. Other hikers began to arrive and fill in all the sites. Met Brian the Ranger, very friendly chat. The final hiker showed up at 8:30p having a tough time finding a spot. Asleep by 9p or so.

##Day 2, 9/14:
**Hamilton Lake to Kern Hot Springs (+Moraine lake), 23.59mi, 4,111' gain**

5a wake up. Explode from my bivy with nature calling. Epic dump in the privy. Wish I grabbed a photo of that view, but I have immediate priorities when I wake up, so much so, I usually dig a cat hole the night before to be prepared. 

We leave Hamilton at 6:10a after deuce deuce, big climb to Precipice Lake to filter water, incredibly beautiful black-stricken rock wall, famously one of Ansel Adam’s many Sierra subjects. Meet a super cool group Langley, Issa(?), Kelly Sue, breaking camp. Hiked and chatted all the way to the top of Kaweah Gap, really nice conversation and lots of laughs. We are all UL: we are ultralight, they say they are ultra luxurious on this trip. A few of them contract for wilderness biology, getting paid to hike/research! They are admittedly still ""unemployed"", haha. They ask what tv show I work on, I reply ""The Pitt""; two of them are from Pittsburgh! Luckily, I have this specific week off from the show while it films pickups in Pittsburgh. They were stopping at Moraine for the night. Said our goodbyes and picked up the pace.

Caught up with the “Party Boys” we had heard about along the trail; 5 guys fishing with tenkara rods, later named by a couple HST friends. They leapfrog us at breakfast/lunch with a good pace. We detour to Moraine Lake, Party Boys fishing, “Hello!”. Ate my Slice House pizza saved from 4 days prior, wearing my sleep boxer briefs in the lake while drying sweaty shirt/shorts, holy shit fire. Real food y’all. Party Boys take off.

We leave Moraine and wished we could literally dive into the Kern River from the top; crazy elevation loss into the canyon, super tired, pretty sore shoulders. Party Boys at the bottom. They were debating hot springs, due to people ahead and the spring having only a small tub for one adult. Tough for a big group. We pushed on and got a great site, only two other hikers. We immediately clean up in the Kern and soak for 20min (I am of the belief that any longer doesn’t have much positive effect), PC in the tub and me in the natural pool that feeds the tub. Pretty sure that was absolutely necessary.

Skurka beans hit crazy hard after that mileage. Discussed whether we would have it in us to do another big day, 7 miles up the Kern, plus some 3500’ gain/13mi climb to Guitar Lake, proceeding a 2a wake up to summit Whitney at sunrise. Seems awful at the moment, we’ll check in tomorrow. No other hikers showed up that night. Slept naked in silk liner barely using quilt, super warm night, and my base layer was already smelly.

##Day 3, 9/15:
**Kern Hot Springs to Guitar Lake, 20.24mi, 5682' gain**

5a wake up, another privy dump. How luxurious. Left camp at 6a after deuce deuce, suddenly the light wind got really cold just before sunrise, colder than any moment the entire trip. Katabatic winds were somewhat of a concern on the Colorado Trail, which is part of why we would break camp before dawn. A bigger reason today was to get up the Kern and Wallace Creek before morning heat.

Forest treadmill until Wallace Creek, then a very gentle climb. I believe hikers have it rough here when starting late, because these gains felt pleasant before the midday heat. Stopped at the JMT/HST junction for cold-soaked protein oats and a yard sale of sweaty clothes. Met Gabe, JMT flip flop hiker, pulling a 40-mile day to Kearsage after summiting Whitney and a 2a start. Wild! Decided to try the bear can washing machine trick since it was always empty and my shirt was horrid. Worked like magic, didnt smell like a dumpster raccoon anymore. 

Pushed to Crabtree for PC to take a dump in the privy, met Graceland and Bob having a little yard sale. Super cool dudes doing HST, absolutely no interest to summit at sunrise, lol respect. Also met Spielberg, a super nice flip flop PCT hiker from Germany. Fires are making it tough this year; really every year now. 

Pushed on to guitar lake, grabbed a couple solid spots just south of the lake. Took forever to set up tarp/bivy in wind, for there to be no wind from there on through the night and morning. Could’ve pitched myself a mansion instead of low wind/storm mode, oh well.

Ate cold-soaked skurka beans at 5:30p, PC swilled his bean juice with electrolyte water. Nasty. Talked to our inspiring 60-something year old neighbors Bad News and his college roommate from 40 years prior for a bit. Weren’t really friends back then, but reconnected over wilderness love. In bed by 7p, but likely not asleep til 9p. Much warmer than I expected, ended up pulling off my alpha mid layers and socks, plus getting out of my shitty pitch to pee.

##Day 4, 9/16:
**Guitar Lake to Mt. Whitney for sunrise, 5.16mi, 3086' gain**

2a rude alarm. Holy shit. Is it really summit day? Ugh, my body. No other headlamps outside, wondering if I’m too early. Something like 5.1mi and 3900’ gain by 6:45a nautical sunrise? Fuck it, I’m awake already. Deflate pad and start packing and dressing in my bivy. Still warmer than I thought, but I layer my toe socks with high calf socks over for the summit. Time for the wag bag! I really don’t mind, I’ve shit in bags before. I think of myself as a veteran in cathole and wag bag use, so the privies have honestly been a little awkward, especially with my backcountry bidet. Leave it ready for deuce deuce.

Two headlamps pass by as I’m returning to my bivy to make cold instant coffee/carnation. No light from PC, I go check on him. He got almost no sleep, headache/altitude hitting. “Is it summit day?” I ask. He says he won’t be far behind, but not banking on sunrise. I understand; with his accolades in the mountains, it’s not that important. 

I pack, filter water, deuce deuce, and take off into the dark at 3:20a with my headlamp, mid layers on, and wind jacket. I see the two other headlamps up ahead 500’ up or higher. 1 mile in, I realize I didn’t start my watch, I didn’t eat my bobo’s pbj, and my wind jacket is making me sweat, so I lose it. The weather is crazy nice. Turn off my headlamp and take in the silhouettes, stars, and now the quarter moon for a few minutes.

Start up again, hear some voices and see two headlamps up ahead. Sarah and Amy who passed my bivy earlier. They are taking it slow, already had a mini-bonk. I say I’m also taking it slow, PC watching my pace and the clock, thinking we are making good time.

Up, up, up to trail crest where our HST/JMT/PCT Trail meets the 99 Switchbacks Trail from Whitney portal, and the temp drops with wind, but still nice in alpha mid layers. Seeing lots of headlamps down the other side, very far away, but one girl comes around the corner to Trail Crest, we say a brief hello. I lose everything I don’t need into the bear can, stash it with the only other one I see there, and then I’ll never forget the moment I put on that backpack with 1/16 of the weight I had been carrying. I felt I could float to the summit. Headed off as blue hour began to light up the silhouettes of the surrounding eastern sierras. 

A mile ahead, the two eastern viewpoints revealed an orange pre-sunset orange horizon. Check my watch, still have a mile to go, shit. Kill my headlamp as I pass Muir peak, just a little 500’ or so climb to go after these other false 14ers and it’s done. 6:25a. I push ahead and run into the girl I saw at trail crest. I say hello, I need a break. I take a few photos for her and then mention we should make sunrise if we keep up our pace. She figured the sun already rose, haha. I turn and push on.

It’s getting much brighter outside. Shit, I gotta pee. Uh oh, that’s a lil too yellow. Slam 500ml of water with some really gross caffeinated electrolyte powder and go. I see the shelter! Oh shit, there’s the sun, peaking through the horizon. I jog the last 500 yards. Literally made it just in time. One other Russian-American hiker (Sebastian?) is there, we congratulate each other and swap the obligatory Whitney sunrise photos. Our stoke slowly turns to amazement and awe as the light hits all of the eastern sierras. It seems insanely silly to do all this for a brief moment of lighting. 

The girl I passed comes up next, Diana. She came from Whitney Portal at 1a! Badass. Sebastian just started the JMT from Whitney portal, that was his bear canister I passed at trail crest. PC arrives earlier than I expected. Behind him are Amy and Susan. We all chat and laugh and congratulate each other. Will and I take wedding style photos eating our last McDoubles. We continue to chat trails and tell stories for an hour or more. What a wonderful summit group. My first 14er!

As others begin to arrive, we figure it’s only getting warmer, let’s head down and attempt Muir. We say goodbye to all our new friends, hit the registry, and begin descending. A trail runner with a nosebleed is running up, lol. I make him aware of it and keep on. 

##Day 4.5:
**Whitney Summit to Whitney Portal, 11mi ~6000' descent**

Once we descend the main peak of Whitney, I see some guys scrambling Crooks Peak a few down from Whitney. I decide to try the closer Keeler Needle, and meet PC at the base of Muir. A girl with no poles who is crushing the trail passes by asking if we’re from Colorado, thinking I’m wearing a Melanzana hoody (it's a thinner Senchi, but I have a smelly melly). We chat and PC gives her the temporary trail name “Lakewood”, her ‘hood in Denver. 

I head up easy 3rd class to the Keeler Needle, but the top out is literally a fuckin’ needle with some bolted anchors. No thanks, I decide 10ft from the top is good enough, snap some photos of the dudes on Crook’s and descend. I meet PC at Muir, he’s halfway up the 3rd class trying to figure out the beta. Suddenly his headache worsens and we decide he should come down. I make the attempt, find my way up 90% of the route. 20’ or so below the summit supposed to be a chimney. I see a flaring hand crack and some stemmy stuff. My hands get a little sweaty. I think about my roasted Altras. I remember how much my body aches; the summit made me forget. Fuck this. Not feeling it. My first failed 14er attempt! Haha.

We descend to trail crest where we find Amy/Susan chatting with Graceland/Bob who are heading up. Bad News and his friend made it. More laughs, congrats, and goodbyes. We repack and head down. 

The rest of the way down was mostly awful, lol. I mean, we found some joy here and there, joked about our aches and pains, met some nice people, etc, but between PC’s altitude headache and our packs still having 1.5 days of food, it was a mind-numbing, knee-crunching, 11-mile descent, including dodging a zoo of hikers on their way up the 99 switchbacks in the morning and midday heat. Half of them are stoked and smiling, half seem their stoke died years ago. Some are crushing, many seem unprepared for the vert, and too many are over-prepared to go to war (huge boots, army canteens, etc). I didn’t take a single picture. I had to force a tuna wrap and some snacks during our midway filter stop, knowing the burger on my mind would cause me to just keep going and bonk. It’s hot. I remember I’m unnecessarily wearing 2 layers of socks for the summit, but I don’t give af about anything except real food. 

Finally, Whitney Portal Store! We ordered double bacon cheeseburgers with green chiles, fries, and Dr Peppers. Friendly cashier walks to the back and we hear, “Doug, we got a couple live ones!” We listened to some trad climbing stories from locals and buy stickers. Doug whips up our burgers and half a watermelon sliced on a plate, complimentary. What a legend! We eat like slobs, and share watermelon slices with a few neighbors hanging out.

Walked out to the parking lots to hitch, 5min and a car stops; it’s Lakewood and her friend/ride who happened to be 1 of the people who PC gave a piece of watermelon, lol. They are camping in the portal, but headed to Lone Pine for a celebratory drink. Great conversation on the short drive to Lone Pine. My wife had left L.A. 3 hours prior, timing could not have worked out better, her and the pup arrived to the store 10m after our hitch. True trail angel: she spent a total of 15 hours in our vehicles between drop-off and p/u. Sparkling waters and air conditioning. Home in L.A. by 7:30p, dead by 8:30p.

 i know i can multitask
i've seen me do it
  many many many times

  when i'm firing on all cylinders 
i can get so much shit done

 if i'm off
nothing happens

 consider me as ""on"" as can be at this point in my life

so if i am able to harness my energy from my mania
  and use it to fuel my skills at multitasking
 oh shit... bitch is gonna be on fire 🤣

now
 what is my key to multitasking? 
  how do i unlock this?

it's kinda simple actually

 set it and forget it


 what do i mean?
lemme try talking gaming for a second

  when i was playing wow
my main was an affliction warlock goblin
#hordeforlife

  if you're unfamiliar
this particular type of caster 
   [meaning ranged magic]
uses damage over time spells

 spells that inflict varying kinds of damage
over varying lengths of time
  layered
 one
  upon the next
 upon the next

i certainly wasn't a great player
  all things considered
 but i was pretty good
i was a casual player more than pvp
   i hated knowing how squishy i could be if i wasn't properly geared/protected
 and that someone could squish me stupidly easily
    just because i wasn't at their level
i was more the farmer/crafter/collector type
 what can i say?
   i love stuff 🤣
 i loved crafting then working the auction house

like the good little gypsy i am 😏

 ...wow
  those words are great!
they work on so many levels!
   😂
#iammytargetaudience

 
 to get back to my main point,

considering exactly how many things i am attempting to accomplish 
 in such a short amount of time

income
 housing
  healthcare
and SO much more

 like the daily grind
4 cats in tow
  no one to help me along my way
as i find my way
  doing my best to make my way

so i must find ways to improve my personal effeciency
 by employing things/methods
that i can cast out
   and come back to when ready

such as particular kitchen things
like my ninja foodie flip toaster oven
 or instant pot

 so many features
so many functions
  and they do a lot of the work for me

or like getting laundry done
 while waiting for my coffee to brew
silly things like that too

ultimately,
 i know 
  if i don't find better ways to hustle
i'll never make it
  to where i so desire to go

 and oh,
how i so desire
  to travel

 i mean,
i am a bit of a space cadet sometimes
  and my little brother is a rocket scientist [by degree]
  physics runs in my family

as per usual,
 i am left wondering 
 exactly how far is it
    that i *can* go?

  i don't know yet
but i'm gonna find out

I already had a hard time being around a coworker I had strong feelings for, but then he got promoted over me, and my managers have treated me badly for daring to ask why.","I've never done anything like this before, posting a long vent like this on Reddit. I was surprised at how long it took me to write it in a way I was satisfied with. All names are fake.

This job is at a very large non-profit establishment in the US, considered a hotspot for local arts. In the department I work in, there are around 35 people.

I began in January 2024 at the same time as two others, Luke and Lindsey. At that time, Luke was 22, I (F) was just about to turn 24, and Lindsey was 26. I guess we all considered each other cool from the start, but didn't immediately jump to hang out outside of work or anything.

In August or September, Luke was promoted to take on some more responsibilities, what I'll call ""Level 2."" At around the same time, he asked if I wanted his number so I could contact him about transport — he gave me a ride home often, if our shifts ended at the same time. He wanted to offer it even if we didn't work at the same time, saying that he could swing by work and pick me up anyway if he was free.

In December, right after I was also promoted to Level 2, Luke broke up with his girlfriend while they were still living together. She sounds like she was a real piece of work, but I won't get into that. It wasn't until January that he was able to move out. I helped him, and it was an interesting day. We had the usual moving woes, struggling with heavy stuff, playing Tetris to fit everything in the van, etc. We did also, unfortunately, briefly run into the ex. After 5 or so hours of hard work, we went out to dinner. He was buying, in exchange for my help.

When I got home, I was already kind of in a stupor from being so sore and eating a ton of food, and got stoned to unwind. I was on my couch, sore and cold and sleepy, and tried to think of how nice it would be to have Cole, another coworker from a different department I'd been interested in, there to snuggle... but suddenly, no matter how much I tried to imagine Cole, his face kept morphing back into Luke's. I couldn't stop thinking about the way the lights of the restaurant caught in his eyes, and how his top front teeth showed a little bit when his mouth gaped open when I got to the craziest parts of my college stories, and his snort! He hates that he snorts when he laughs, he gets all flustered about it.

I hoped desperately that this was just brought on by the coma-like state I was in, a harmless fantasy because sometimes you just can't help having those about friends, but once I'd sobered up the next morning, I realized I really did feel this way.

The next few months saw us meeting up many times outside of work. Once, in a spur of the moment thing, we went out to a coffee shop that stays open super late, and ended up talking about just about every topic you can imagine until 1 in the morning. I had dinner with him and my 2 best non-work friends on my birthday (February). He lives pretty close to the college I went to, so I gave him a casual tour in March. Most interestingly, over time, he stopped having a strong reaction when I pointed out his snort. At first, he was like, ""goddammit! No! Fuck! Stop! I hate you!"" but over time, he came to just nod, grin ruefully, and say ""yeah."" I thought that was a great sign, that he was accepting that I liked this thing about him that he was embarrassed about, as if he was letting me in.

One day in April, we were planning to go to the zoo, but then his car broke down at 11:30 the night before — and amazingly, I happened to know, just from casual conversation with her, that Lindsey and her boyfriend *were also going to the zoo that day*, and they were happy to give us a ride. I was so excited that this massive coincidence had happened, allowing us to keep our plans — I'm not a superstitious person, but that was really hard to not read into.

While at the zoo, Luke made a joke that really upset me: basically, he implied that I was somehow a bad person for having not heard of something he liked. Once Lindsey and her BF dropped us off back at Luke's house, we sat down on the couch, and I teared up and said, ""you know I really like you, but your joke earlier really hurt. I am not less of a person for not liking the same things as you."" He gasped and said he didn't realize that it would land that way. We had another long talk that veered into many different topics, including some stuff like the environments we grew up in, and showed each other some really old selfies, *and he straight-up said I was cute in one from 5 years ago.* Then we went out to eat again, and then parted ways.

Over text, I later suggested that I could make him dinner at my place for our next time hanging out, which I was worried was a little too forward... but he said it was fine, and we set a date. Unfortunately, a couple days later, he sent me a text that said ""after looking over my schedule, I'm gonna have to back out - the past few months have been really demanding with work. I will happily reach out to you when I have the time and energy.""

Over the next month, I did not know how to approach him at work. I didn't know if he needed space there, too. There were times when I wanted to cry just from being in the same room as him because I was so confused, and how can someone sitting right next to you feel like they're on the other side of the country? He was promoted to ""Level 3,"" and I didn't know how to congratulate him. I don't think I even mentioned it.

Finally, in early May, my therapist helped me draft a text that said ""I'm getting mixed signals and would appreciate knowing what your boundaries are."" Luke replied, ""I enjoy our friendship, but I need space as a person. I want to be able to build a life outside of our workplace (he's fairly new to town) and need to think about the boundaries that I have to build for that to happen.""

I was torn between three long responses, which boil down to:

1. ""I can't relate to that, I don't understand how to have a friendship that only exists in one place, so I think we should just keep it professional;""
2. ""I actually have feelings for you, and what I want would DEFINITELY be against your idea of boundaries, so I think we should just keep it professional;""
3. and ""I can't relate to that, I don't understand how to have a friendship that only exists in one place, but I have learned to adapt to situations I don't understand before, so that's fine!""

I wish I could have sent the first one, but I was desperate to keep him in my life however I could. So I picked the third one.

The next time I saw him was at work on his birthday; I'd gotten him a novelty T-shirt of his favorite actor, which earned a snort. I asked if we were good, and he seemed genuinely surprised and said ""yes! We're friends!"" and pinky-swore it.

Looking back on it, I do think that we were more or less on the right path to eventually develop something, between his acceptance of me making him snort, his willingness to discuss really deep or personal topics with me, and a couple other remarks he made that stuck out. But when I teared up and we had that long heart-to-heart talk, I think that kind of set off an alarm for him — ""I'm seeing this person at work, I'm getting vulnerable with this person outside of work, am I ready to have this person so present in my life? After I just got out of this awful relationship?"" — that made him back out.

And it still hurt working with him. It hurt knowing I would only see him there, and it hurt seeing him laugh and be happy with other coworkers, because now there was nothing that made me different from them.

Finally, on June 11th, I decided that the line had to be drawn. I asked Luke for 5 minutes' time after our shift. Outside the building, I asked if there was any other reason that he had wanted to pull back to just work friends, as my last shot at exploring how he felt. But, ""yeah, I was really overwhelmed at work and needed to make some space. I do consider you a friend, though.""

""Okay. Well... I think we should just keep it professional, because the truth is, I have feelings for you, and I don't think things are going to go in that direction... I'm sorry to do this to you, since you do say you still want to be friends, but I think it's the healthy thing for me, and I guess it does play into the whole thing about your boundaries, so I hope it does kind of work for you. But I just think this is the only way I'm going to heal.""

""Wow, thanks for saying that. Um... yeah, feelings are complicated.""

""Yeah.""

""I'm... sorry I didn't pick up on that sooner, or anything.""

""It's okay. It was out of your control.""

""Oh, my Uber is here — I'll see you at work.""

""Yeah, see you at work.""

*fistbump, initiated by him*

Then he said, ""Take care of yourself, okay?""

All I could do was nod, because if I opened my mouth, I'd start bawling. And then he got in the car and it drove off.

To say the rest of the summer was awful is an understatement. Various parts of my brain tried to convince me that I'd done the wrong thing, trying to convince me that I could somehow bargain my way back into his life, as I kicked myself for throwing away someone that wonderful. My friends told me that what I'd done was brave, getting it out there, but being brave is a good thing, so why didn't I feel good? I had previously cried in therapy maybe once or twice, but then I started doing it every week.

On July 3, five days after I nearly got my face ripped off by a dog, I had a crash on my scooter. I suffered a concussion, a decent bang on my shin, bit the inside of my cheek quite badly, and absolutely shattered my phone. Now, I am a hypochondriac, and I had also just seen a certain older relative for the first time in a couple years who had seriously declined, so the concussion was making me panic, barely able to think about anything other than developing dementia. As a result of my brain being a little rattled, and continuing to rattle itself with all these awful thoughts, I made a bad decision.

I made a little note and slipped it into Luke's backpack at work (in its external pocket for water bottles, as it was hanging on the same wall as everyone else's backpacks and jackets). It said,

>""IDK if you've heard (seems to be the office gossip), but I had a pretty good scooter crash lately. I'm mostly-ish unharmed, but it made me think about what could've been left unsaid if that hadn't been the case. I've been meaning to say ""sorry I had to say what I said while you were pressed for time"" anyway, since you didn't really get to respond. Having an adult conversation about what happened feels like something we could both benefit from. If you agree, please know I'm not asking for you to put aside the time and energy for this immediately, it can wait until you're ready. If you don't, I get it, and all I want to know is if you liked the song I gave you.""

(One of the last things I did before realizing I had to break off with him was give all my friends little cards with the name of a song and painting that I felt had their energy. It was mostly an excuse to tell him that he reminded me of a certain very gentle, sweet song.)

Weeks passed, and nothing happened. At first, I was just thinking that he needed to figure out what he'd say to me, but then I came to realize that I had probably done the wrong thing, and that he was upset at me for dragging this out and violating that boundary. There are a lot of things wrong with that note, but I think the worst part is ""an adult conversation."" It's like I'm implying that if he doesn't want to discuss it, he's being childish. But I was the one being childish by trying to contact him that way, and not being able to see in the moment why it was wrong to do. The concussion doesn't excuse it.

At the beginning of August, shortly after my doctor proclaimed me recovered from the concussion, I interviewed to also become Level 3. The interview was conducted by Sandra, our manager, and Maria, the department head (so, Sandra's boss). They offered me the job before the interview was over, and I was happy to accept.

At the same time, someone else from the office, Rachel, was leaving. Rachel was what I'll call a ""junior supervisor,"" a position that reports to ""senior supervisors,"" who in turn report to Sandra. Another junior, Jerry, was going on extended leave. This left the office with only 1 junior, which is bad because there's supposed to always be one present while we're open, and that was not doable with that person's schedule. Two hours after the interview, Maria came out of her office, *walked up to me, and told me to my face that I should apply for the junior supervisor position.*

Over the next couple weeks, Sandra and the senior supes said repeatedly, to everyone, in our daily meetings: ""No prior supervisory experience is required; training will cover everything. You don't even have to be Level 2.""

And so, two weeks after my successful interview for Level 3, I was back in the same conference room, and Sandra and Maria and I were in the same chairs as before. This time, they did not offer me the job immediately, which set me on edge. I scoured their schedules (everyone's is viewable on our scheduling software), and found no interviews besides mine and one other, with Chad, a really wonderful guy who'd been around much longer than me. I tried to convince myself that it *had* to be me and Chad, because I couldn't find any evidence of other interviews, and Sandra and Maria both seemed to have really wanted me to apply from the start.

Three days later, I encountered Chad in the breakroom, learned that he'd gotten the job, and offered my congratulations. I went down to the office, and asked Sandra lightheartedly, ""heyyy, you got any interesting news to share?"" She seemed hesitant, and said we should go into Maria's empty office to talk.

""So, as you may have figured out since you haven't gotten any communication... we did not decide to go forward with you at this time. We think you're a good worker, and it was a hard decision, but we just think you don't have enough experience in Level 3 yet.""

This was a complete and blatant contradiction to how Sandra and the other leadership had been advertising the position's requirements. But that wasn't what was on my mind.

I swallowed. ""I need..."" I was tearing up. ""I need... I need to know... if one of the other people selected... was Luke.""

""Um... yes, Luke has very limited availability, but he is one of the people we've selected.""

""I see. Look, I... Luke and I... we used to hang out outside of work a lot... and I got feelings. I told him... I had to break it off. I'm uncomfortable with... reporting to him directly.""

If Luke and I had both remained Level 3, that would have been disappointing for both of us, but still a billion times better than having this imbalance where face-to-face communication would now be required. (I acknowledge that Luke would feel the same thing in my place, but he, I, and all other workers have to be honest about when a workplace situation makes us uneasy, and I just happened to be in that situation instead of him.) Sandra nodded, said she knew that these things happen sometimes, and offered to schedule us around each other. I declined, not wanting either of us to suffer a cut in hours.

When I got home, I burst into tears in the shower, then again when I got out, and I managed to explain the events of the past months to my roommate. ""I don't even know who to be mad at. I know logically that it's management, but every cell in my body is saying Luke, Luke, because I think sometimes our brains just don't know any better than 'this person is the reason I'm hurting.'""

The next day, I managed to put together some of my thoughts about being rejected for the job, and sent them to Nick. Our workplace is unionized, with the junior supes being the highest position represented; Nick is our business agent.

I explained to him that I was confused about why I'd even gotten the chance to apply for supervisor. It wasn't like I was going to catch up to Luke's additional few months of Level 3 experience in the two weeks between my application and the interview! If my lack of experience was going to be a problem, why did I even get the chance to interview? I felt like the whole thing had been rigged, and that we had been given conflicting information regarding how much prior experience was needed, and I wanted Nick's input on how I should voice my protest.

One part of the email I sent Nick was, ""To be clear, I don't think that Luke starting Level 2 and Level 3 before me is an inherently bad thing, just as I don't think any less of Lindsey for still being Level 1.""

Only a half hour after I sent that, I got into work. I logged onto the computer and checked my work email. There was an email from Sandra to our department, congratulating the three people who'd been promoted to supervisor. Luke, you already know. Chad, you already know.

The third was Lindsey.

Lindsey, who was still Level 1, when Sandra had told me to my face not 24 hours ago that my lack of Level 3 experience was the big deal.

I stood up a little in my seat. My jaw actually dropped, and I felt my temperature rising. I genuinely felt like I had been slapped across the face. I went over to Sandra's cubicle, and said in a tone I was fighting very hard to keep calm, ""You told me last night that I didn't get promoted because I didn't have enough Level 3 experience. Why did Lindsey get it, then?""

""I don't appreciate you bringing that up in front of everyone. Come on, let's talk."" So we went back into the empty office. I have no explanation for how I was able to keep myself from saying, ""And I don't appreciate being lied to.""

Sandra completely walked back everything she had said the previous night. She claimed she hadn't meant to give the impression that my lack of Level 3 experience automatically disqualified me. So, just to recap, first it was ""no prior experience necessary,"" then it was ""lots of prior experience *here* necessary,"" and then, since Lindsey's time as a supervisor at a previous job was apparently the clincher, ""no prior experience *here* necessary, but lots of prior experience *elsewhere* necessary.""

Now, here's the thing: **I have supervisor experience from a prior job, too.** I have more supervisor experience than Luke, and more experience at this place than Lindsey. And, unlike Lindsey's, my supervisor experience *was at the same kind of place as this one.*

I expressed that I didn't feel like I'd been given enough time or questions in the interview to discuss this prior experience.

""Okay. Well, when Maria is back in town, we can have a meeting and talk about it,"" she said.

""Good. And I'd like for Nick to be there."" I then apologized for ""coming in hot,"" which Sandra was gracious about (""it happens""), and that was that.

Nick was also out of town for a time, so I had a few days to suffer by myself. I walked into therapy the next week, ready to explain everything that had happened, but my therapist, who I was seeing since November 2023, started off by saying she had some bad news. She was starting to shift more toward working with kids, and wanted to refer me to someone else. Of course that had to happen that week.

Losing Luke had been agony on its own. But losing Luke, upsetting him, having him swoop in from left field and get a job I really wanted, and then having Sandra go back-and-forth on *why*... that's something I've never felt before and never want to again.

Finally, on September 5, I was able to get a phone call with Nick. I restated everything that had happened with the supervisor job, my utter confusion, and the conflicting messages I was getting. He agreed that it was a strange situation, and said that I had the right to be upset.

Then he said he'd already been emailing with management to figure out a meeting time, and something else surprising: this meeting wouldn't be with Sandra and Maria. It would be with Maria and Bella — one of the directors of the whole organization. *Maria's* boss. I'd never spoken to her before in my life.

Two days later, after I saw Nick anyway at a monthly union meeting, he told me about some emails that had been going around between Sandra, Maria, and Bella. He had been CC'd into them as a result of my request that he be in the loop. And there was some incredibly unprofessional and flat-out untrue language in them.

In an email to Bella, Sandra apparently used a sentence that I will never forget for the rest of my life: ""I was given the impression that \[my name\] is trying to bully her way into the position.""

For years, I have struggled with the idea that others might find me intimidating, due to my height and unusual features stemming from health issues. I thought I was on the right track when it came to overcoming that image of myself, but Sandra's implication that I was trying to intimidate her brought it all crashing down. I have never said anything meant as an attack on Chad, Luke, or Lindsey, who are all fine people and good workers.

And I was bullied quite severely all through elementary, middle, and high school (yes, it was in part due to my appearance), and I have NO TOLERANCE for hearing that word used like this. Bullying is when two boys tickle you from either side so you can't get out. Bullying is when a guy tries to convince you that he went to your house on lunch break and killed your turtle. Bullying is when someone says ""hey, I just pulled a \[your name\]!"" after doing something they regretted. Bullying is when people make you twerk in the locker room. Being upset because you feel lied to and like you didn't get a fair shot? Not bullying.

Sandra claimed that I was ""confrontational"" during BOTH of my approaches to her. You read how I talked to her when I first asked if I'd gotten promoted; you know that is flat-out untrue. She also said, ""Based on nov21throwaway's approach to the situation, I'm confident that we made the right decision."" In other words, ""nov21throwaway was upset that she was given conflicting information about why she didn't get the role; this proves that she was not the right person for the role.""

My name has been dragged through the mud, in official communications to the second-highest person in the organization, for the crime of being visibly upset at being given wildly conflicting information multiple times.

The requested meeting finally happened on Friday, September 12. Nick, Howard (an older Level 3 worker who is in training to become a union steward), and I sat down across from Maria and Bella.

Maria's response to me saying ""you told me to my face to apply"" was to just go into a truly incredible ""I was just upholding DEI"" routine where she said, ""well, I think it's very important to tell people who aren't cis white straight males to apply for jobs."" Well, if you really cared about that, Maria, you wouldn't constantly misgender my trans coworkers, and you would hire more than one non-white person per year.

Bella said, ""It was not Sandra's intention to give conflicting information. You admitted to bringing up the topic kind of abruptly, and we aren't at our best when we're caught off-guard."" Howard would later say to me and Nick, ""They interviewed 4 people to fill 3 spots. HOW were they not prepared to have SOME kind of conversation where a person asked why they were left out?""

Maria went on a long rant about offering to ""coach"" me, and said that someone else had once said directly to her, ""I'd like to learn how to do what you do, and run a place like this."" She claimed to have put that person on the right path to a promotion. Maria ultimately did not give that person a promotion. That person was Rachel, the old supervisor whose departure kicked off this whole thing. As I was reminded by a former coworker via Discord later,

>""Maria openly scorned both Sam (former assistant mgr) and Rachel, up to and including telling Rachel to her face that she wasn't promoted because she 'didn't have any leadership skills.' To take credit for either of their success is somehow yet another layer of cruelty on top \[...\] I am not shocked that she is taking credit for either person's success. She has a lengthy, thoroughly documented history of mistreating staff that she doesn't personally get along with \[...\] while pretending to champion diversity in the workplace, and pretending to celebrate the success of marginalized employees when they manage to escape her. She's actually just happy to not have to work with people she doesn't like on a personal level.""

There is no logic in how people were chosen for this promotion, or how the qualifications were explained. Nor is there logic or honesty in how I have been spoken to, and spoken about, since learning I was not promoted. I do not feel that I have been given a fair opportunity, and I have realized that I am not going to progress at this place under this kind of ""leadership.""

I am done working at this clown show, but I can't find a way out.

The day before the big meeting, I had a Zoom interview at a similar place, just a quick thing with HR to go over the basics. I was invited to a second interview the next Sunday, the 14th, which seemed to go really well, with the person I would actually be reporting to. I was told I'd hear back by the end of the week, but there was nothing. My emails have gone unanswered. The week hurtled by because I was just waiting, refreshing my email, unable to focus on anything else. Why can't they just extend me the dignity of a ""no?"" It was a really good job, too, the full-time version of the one I just missed out on, with benefits and everything. Saturday the 20th saw me having a panic attack in the work bathroom and calling my therapist and begging her to take me back, which didn't work.

Luke is in training for the junior supervisor position now. Pretty soon, I'm going to have to report to him. I'm going to have the whole mess about promotions rubbed in my face by walking past a cubicle that has his name on it in official signage. I'm going to have to see him a lot more than I do now.

I can't do this. I would dearly miss most of my coworkers. Lindsey is a delightful presence, and Howard is such a strong and uncensored supporter for our rights as workers (and he approached me directly to say he was surprised and disappointed I didn't get the job, long before the meeting was even arranged), and there are so many others that weren't relevant to this post but are so kind and funny. But I cannot be in the same room with Luke without wanting the ground to open up and swallow me, I have no faith that that will ever improve, and I cannot work for managers that treat me like this.

I know, I know, most shifters have felt their limbs being torn out and many other unpleasant stuff I luckily can't know how it feels. But I wanted to mention something else.

When they spike the wine with his spinal fluid, they probably use quite a lot, since there are a lot of wine bottles going around. Now, what I can tell you from experience, is that spinal fluid extraction SUCKS IMMENSELY. I've had a few in my life, around 6 when I was a kid (part of an experimental therapy for a tumor) and one 5 years ago, to verify after 15 years that I was still cancer-free. I only remember vividly the last one, but I remember that I absolutely hated it even at 6 years old. 

Trigger warning for medical stuff if you don't like to read it.

Now, what happens at first is you lay down and they stab you with a needle between two of your lower vertebrae. Anesthesia helps, but does not numb all the pain. I have a high pain tolerance, but let me tell you, I bit that belt with all my power and still let out a tear or two. Then, they start pulling up the fluid, and it feels quite weird, like your essence partially leaving your body. They can't take a lot of it, because your body needs it. When they're done, the hole burns, and you're left with a low but constant back pain. And it's just begun. Welcome to your hours-long personal hell in which you have to lay still on your belly while sipping on coffee, because if you move your head or, worse, your back, you are instantly rewarded with a headache I hope you all never experience. This part was probably faster for Zeke, because he can regenerate faster. The coffee also helps, either to speed up recovery or for the pain, I don't remember. It takes a day for you to be able to move freely.

So, today I realized that Zeke voluntarily subjected himself to multiple lumbar punctures with probably little anesthesia(maybe being the son of a phisician gave him the best drugs of the time, but I don't know how advanced they are) in a short span of time.

So I’m here from Delhi on a short 2-week business trip and decided to explore the city a bit in my free time. Gotta say — Bangalore is genuinely beautiful. The weather? Amazing. People? Super chill. The cafes, parks, vibes? All great.

But then there’s the **roads**. And the **traffic**.

Coming from Delhi/Gurgaon, I honestly thought I’d seen the worst of Indian traffic. I used to believe nothing could beat the hell that is Delhi-GGN peak hours... until I landed here. I don’t even know how to describe what I experienced — it’s not just traffic, it’s a full-on endurance test.

Forget peak hours — even regular evenings feel like apocalypse mode. Took me more than **2 hours to cover 10 km at 7 PM**. Like... how? Why? Where is the road? Half of them are dug up, the rest are filled with potholes or randomly blocked.

I’ve travelled across most major Indian cities — Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata — none of them come close to this level of chaos. And what baffles me even more is that this is a city with some of the biggest tech parks and top global companies — and yet, the infrastructure feels like it's straight out of the 90s.

Seriously, how do you guys do this *every day*? And why aren’t more people furious about it? Has everyone just... accepted it? Is there some coping mechanism I need to download?

I’m genuinely curious — what’s stopping Bangalore from fixing this? Is it politics? Corruption? Poor planning? All of the above?

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for the filter coffee and the nice weather. But damn, these roads are something else.

I have dual US/UK citizenship and am flying to the UK for a three week trip next month.

I know that I need to use my UK passport to get into the UK and my US passport to come back into the US, but it’s one small detail that has me confused.

If I hand my UK passport to Delta to scan when I check in for my flights to the UK then my boarding pass won’t have my TSA pre-check info and I’ll be stuck in the regular (endless) US security line. If I give them my US passport it will have the right TSA information but will it trigger them to ask for an UK ETA which I don’t have (because I don’t need it)?

TLDR: How can I both use my TSA Pre-Check on my outbound flight from the US AND not trigger a check for an ETA that I can’t get as a dual citizen? Should I just resign myself to two hours in the non-pre check line and taking off my shoes, removing liquids, etc?

A 46-year-old Scot, successfully transplanted to the wilds of Pennsylvania. I've traded the lochs and glens for rolling hills and the occasional Wawa run, and I have to say, it's not half bad.

About me:

The accent is 100% authentic. It’s particularly effective for ordering coffee and confusing telemarketers.

I enjoy a good single malt whisky, but I'm quickly developing an appreciation for Pennsylvania's local breweries.

My passions lie somewhere between getting out for a good hike on a crisp autumn day and getting cozy on the sofa with a great film (anything from a tense thriller to a stupidly funny comedy).

I have my life together—stable career, own place, can cook a few decent meals that don't involve haggis (unless you're into that).

My sense of humor is a bit dry, a bit sarcastic, and essential for navigating life. I believe laughing, especially at yourself, is a vital life skill.

Who I'm looking for:

A woman (let's say 35-55ish) who is kind, intelligent, and doesn't take herself too seriously. Someone who can hold a conversation that goes beyond small talk, who is passionate about something, and who believes a good partner is a teammate. A shared sense of humor is a massive plus.

I notice Dog ownership is much greater here. Almost everyone has a dog and some people have two! 

I'd prefer to live back in the country among forest, fields, streams, etc. but for now I'm here and live, like many, in an apartment building.  I try to not spend too much time isolated in my little concrete box so many mornings I go to one of the two nearby Parks close to my apartment. However ...

Dogs & dog owners ruin the Park(s) for me & others!

I'll be sitting on a bench reading, writing, sipping coffee, etc. and then the wind will blow my way and I'll be hit by an intense smell of dog feces!   The rubbish bins are half empty or full of baggies of sh*t.  & then there's owners that don't pickup after their dogs. One must watch where they step at all times!  Or dogs will surprise me sniffing my crotch or something else unwarranted.  Dogs bark &/or fight each other and their owners have to break it up. I hate it.

Like I said, I won't always live here in this city.  I'll get another job and/or retire to some greener place someday soon.

It just sucks that the only natural reprieve from this bustling city smells & sounds of Dogs every damn day!

1nqef0a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqef0a,The Ultimate Guide to Korean Oreos: Strawberry to Cinnamon Bun,"After trying Oreos from everywhere, I’ve gotta say Korea REALLY knows how to remix a cookie and they put real effort into it. They don’t just stop at chocolate-on-chocolate, they treat Oreos like little desserts, each one tasting like its own café treat or sweet shop classic. I’ve been taste-testing my way through the lineup, and here’s the fun little tour with some of my faves:

1. **Strawberry Creme Oreos** \-- This one tastes like strawberry milk in cookie form — bright, candy-sweet and totally pink energy! It’s light and easy, the kind of snack you’d grab on a stroll past a Korean convenience store for a quick sugar boost. Feels playful, not heavy and just better tasting than the US version.
2. **Cinnamon Bun Oreos** \-- Warm bakery vibes all through. The filling leans into that gooey, frosting-top cinnamon bun note, so it pairs perfectly with coffee or a cozy cafe moment. Feels more like a pastry than a cookie though but that comfort factor is what made it memorable for me!! 
3. **Korean Red Velvet Oreos** \-- This is red velvet cake squeezed into a sandwich cookie... cocoa-mild, velvety cream, zero pretension. Also.. the texture is softer and more buttery than standard Oreos, making it feel closer to cake than cookie. If red velvet is a mood, this one nails it. 
4. **Tiramisu Oreo Thins** \-- Because it’s a Thin, the texture stays crisp while the flavors feel more grown up and less cloying. Tastewise it's like espresso bitterness meets mascarpone-style cream. Perfect for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up with actual coffee. 
5. **Choco Mousse Thins --** Think airy chocolate mousse but in Oreo form? The filing is silky and the thin wafer keeps it elegant, so it feels like dessert for people who don’t want a sugar coma🤭 Great when craving real chocolate depth but also a delicate bite. Probably my favourite of the bunch.
6. **Peach Oolong Oreos --** A surprise in the best way: juicy peach meets the floral, slightly toasty note of oolong tea. It reads like afternoon tea in a cookie, the kind of flavor that makes people ask where it came from. This one truly feels like a real Korean cookie!",1,1758824564.0,popsnaxworld,0,1.0,False

I used electrical tape as an insulator and aluminum foil as a conductor, with a wire attached to plug in to a wall to ground the faraday cage. I layered foil and electrical tape with no gaps, cracks, holes, around 4 coffee tables and it was a box big enough for me to sleep in. Look up faraday cage, but it can't have holes in it like you'll see.

  
I promise you, a faraday cage is the only way to stop the directed energy weapons and I promise you it works. What it does is create a conductive barrier around the enclosure to the satellite weapons that are trying to resonant with your body, can no longer come in contact with your body's resonance. So the weapons will hit the outside of the enclosure and be conducted and dissipated basically. 

  
Let me know what you think and stay strong. I was targeted starting in Aug 2014 and I thought I would die or be homeless or in jail forever. Fortunately my parents let me live with them and I am working a job and investing and on my way to a good life. Believe in yourself and you will get through this.

And you will have people that are more prone to stalking and harassment over the years and it will come back, but I just stay inside.

The truth was way funnier.,"So, I had one of those classic PM moments a while back that I just have to share. The Head of Sales, a super intense guy who could sell water to a well, corners me one morning, coffee in hand, looking deadly serious. He tells me we absolutely *need* a new, bright red 'Export to Super-Specific-Format' button right on our main dashboard. According to him, the clients were practically rioting in the streets for it.

He was so convincing. He painted this picture of dozens of our highest-paying customers getting frustrated every single day, unable to perform this one critical task. The pressure was on. The exec team heard about it, and suddenly this button became a top-priority item. I was getting emails with subject lines like 'URGENT: Button Update??'. For a couple of days, I felt that familiar dread of having to shoehorn a feature into the UI that just felt… wrong.

Instead of just writing the ticket, my team and I decided to do a little digging. We put on our detective hats and reached out to the account managers. We asked, 'Hey, can you connect us with some of the clients who have been asking about this export feature?' We were expecting a flood of contacts. Instead, we got… crickets. After a few days of awkward follow-ups, the truth finally surfaced. It wasn't 'all our clients.' It wasn't even a handful. It was *one* single, very loud client who had our Head of Sales on speed dial.

We ended up scheduling a call with that one client. We listened to their problem and realized they didn't really want a button at all. They just needed a specific report delivered to their inbox once a week. We built a simple, automated email report for them that took a fraction of the time and didn't clutter the dashboard for our thousands of other users. The Head of Sales was happy because his big client was happy, and we were happy because we avoided adding a completely useless button.

It was a perfect reminder that behind every loud feature request is a real problem, and it's rarely what it looks like on the surface. So, what's the wildest 'everyone wants this' feature request you've gotten that turned out to be just one person yelling into the void?",1,1758824226.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

But second dates? That’s when I like to switch it up. It’s less about impressing, more about connecting.

# What to Look for in a Second-Date Scent

The best second-date fragrances feel **warm**, **inviting**, and just intriguing enough to make someone lean in closer.  
Here’s how I break it down:

* **Comfort:** Something cozy or softly sweet (think vanilla, soft florals).
* **Intrigue:** A note that adds depth—maybe a little spice, musk, or woods.
* **Confidence:** Whatever makes *you* feel amazing—because confidence is the real magic.

# Crowd-Favorite Picks That Work

* **Baccarat Rouge 540:** Smooth, sweet, quietly powerful. The kind of scent that sparks follow-up questions.
* **Black Opium by YSL:** Coffee, vanilla, and a little edge. Great for evening dates with a flirty vibe.
* **Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana:** Easygoing and fresh. Perfect for casual second hangs.

# Tips to Make It Last (Without Being Loud)

* One spray on wrists, one behind ears. Done.
* Moisturized skin holds scent longer.
* If you’re layering, go light—this isn’t the time to test combos.

# Final Thought

Your second-date fragrance doesn’t need to shout. It should *invite*.

I started my weight loss journey at 80 kg on July 10 and I’m now down to 73.8 kg thanks to sticking with a calorie deficit and doing Zumba a few times a week 💃. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m proud of the consistency so far.

One thing I did not expect, though, are the weird little side effects. Ever since I cleaned up my eating and cut back on sugar/processed food, I feel like my sense of smell has gotten noticeably stronger. I catch myself noticing scents I never really picked up on before and sometimes it shows up in very unexpected ways 😅.

For example, coffee makes my pee smell strongly like coffee, and when I eat salmon, well… let’s just say my poop smells like salmon. Before I started dieting, I never really noticed these things, but now it’s like my body is way more “transparent” about what I put into it.

Has anyone else experienced something like this when losing weight or changing their diet? Is it just my body adjusting, or do other people find their senses get sharper too? I know it’s a little gross, but I’m curious if this is actually a common part of the process!

The first year was fun, happy, exciting, sensual and pretty much great 90% of the time. The last two years things have just gone downhill gradually due to his behavior towards me. I am early 30's attractive, petite, friendly, adventurous, responsible in that I have my own house, money, cars, career etc. It started gradually with the way I dress and him saying things to me like "" those shorts are too short"" ""pull your shirt up I can see down your shirt"" to making me sit next to him in a booth in a restaurant always so that he could put his hand up the back of my shirt. He will ask me to put my leg over his leg so he can rub on my leg and this made me so uncomfortable seeing as we're in public and it's just inappropriate and awkward when the waitress comes over to take our order etc. I started a new job and after a while my colleagues started to add me on FB both male and female. He saw that I had accepted a friend request from a male co-worker on FB, I didn't have anyone's phone number, didn't hang out outside of work, just that I had added and he lost it and started in on me with "" Oh, he's single, why don't you go out with him. He's a single dad, look a great opportunity for you. Why don't you get his number, you can get on your knees and suck his C\*\*K, sneak him into your house and let him bend you over and F\*\*K you, you can suck and F\*\*K all night long, Go for it!!!"". He tortured me for two days calling me incessantly with messages saying the most degrading things 100 times non-stop while I was trying to work until I blocked him. Then he would use his office phone, his work cell, even his own son's cell phone, email from 3 different accounts. I blocked and blocked but it was so emotionally draining to keep receiving these messages and harassment simply for adding a male co-worker on social media. He knew I had an appointment coming up the next day and waited until I parked and then jumped into my car. Obviously I should've just dropped him right there, he apologized profusely and I let it go. Then it would creep up again with comments if I looked nice "" Wow, you look nice, getting all the attention you want from guys"" to sitting next to me in a coffee shop where I was thinking deeply staring off into space when he leans over and says "" What?! You wanna go fuck him?"" because there was a man across the cafe and I happened to zone out in that general direction. He was there for me during a very difficult time in my life and was so supportive and kind. But lately he's just unfriendly and controlling about anything I wear, doesn't want me to go to any gym unless I go with him, wants me to be on the phone with him the entire time if anyone comes to work on my house that is male, accuses me of being an attention seeker for dressing nice ( like leather ankle boots, jeans, and a full sleeve sweater that's off the shoulder on one side) and basically acts like I'm just dressing up for other men, if I even talk to another man he starts in asking me why don't I go and get their number and get to know them. Most recently I went to a shop to buy sandals and I was on the phone with him and he heard me talking to the teenage guy running the register and again the same thing about how I'm supposedly enjoying getting attention from a guy and saying that I'm probably going to go back later and get his number.. I have brought it up, not in a rude or aggressive way and when I say anything he doesn't want to hear he will interupt "" Just stop. STOP STOP STOP STOP!!!"". Asking me why I can't just ""be nice"" and if I don't want to talk to him because he's being rude or nasty he'll just harass until I block him and then send messages saying "" Stop being silly"" ""Stop being stubborn"" ""Come on, please talk to me I'm sorry"".  I have explained that I'm not ""being silly"" I'm a grown woman with valid feelings and should be treated as an adult not talked down to like a child. He's started to gaslight me the past few days, for example telling me he really wants to be intimate and cuddle with me which I said I didn't want to. He said ""No you're going to give it to me, I need it right now"" and I said very firmly ""NO, I'm not"". He brings it up again and I told him that I am not in mood at all, that I don't have to ANYTHING I don't want to and that he needs to stop saying things like that to me. He then denies ever saying it. He's started doing this and it's insane, he will say something to me and then flat out deny that he said it just a few minutes later right to my face!  Today I gave him two opportunities to talk about a specific subject and he just interrupts and shouts over me saying to shut up and let him explain, by this he usually means he's going to list excuses for how I ""made him"" act a certain way, do something abusive to me, say something awful to me etc. Tell me that I'm a ""button-pusher"" which generally means that I said something he didn't want to hear even if I say something true in a non-confrontational way. He doesn't want to hear it. There are many more stories that go back that are similar, I'm just to the point now that I can't sustain this level of stress and abuse from someone that I do care about and who has in the past been there for me in hard times.. I can't do it anymore.  I feel guilty because he is in a difficult situation at the moment for something that he put himself in and that he deserves what's coming to him. He's out of control throwing himself a pity party and lying to himself telling himself he's the victim and lashing out on me because of it. I feel badly and I really want to relieve myself of the burden of him. Not really a question, but I had to say it somewhere.",1,1758824078.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1nqe6w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1nqe6w4/plant_light_helped_with_turmeric_staining/,Plant Light Helped with Turmeric Staining,"I came across a post about using the sun to help with aligner discoloration for turmeric stains, but with all the rain lately I had to get creative. I tried my plant light instead and it actually helped.

Here’s the context:

* **What happened**: On Monday I accidentally drank a turmeric wellness shot while wearing my Invisalign. 🤦‍♀️
* **How long it sat**: A few days (not ideal). Plus, I regularly drink coffee with them in, so I wasn’t expecting a full reset.
* **What I tried**: I brush them regularly with unscented foam soap and soaked them in denture cleaner since it happened with no change. Today, I put my aligners in a glass with enough water to cover them for about 90 minutes under a plant light.
* **The result**: The yellow didn’t completely disappear, but it’s lighter. Enough of a difference that it feels worth sharing.

It’s not a miracle cure, but if you’re dealing with turmeric stains and sunlight isn’t an option, this might help. I suspect that if I did this quickly after the stain happened, it might have made more of a difference.
