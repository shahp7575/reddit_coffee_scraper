1q6n4cw,https://i.redd.it/njjj03kuyybg1.jpeg,Scrolling endlessly? What if we actually met people from our own locality?,"Ami lately একটা জিনিস খুব strongly feel করছি—especially under 30s দের মধ্যে depression, anxiety আর emptiness ভীষণ common হয়ে গেছে।
আমার personal feeling, এর একটা বড় কারণ real-life loneliness।
College শেষ, job শুরু—একটা সময়ের পর বন্ধুবান্ধবের circle ছোট হতে থাকে।
আর আমরা তখন কী করি?ঘণ্টার পর ঘণ্টা social media scroll, অন্যদের “perfect life” দেখি ,নিজের life টা আরও empty লাগে l Irony টা হলো—আমরা হাজার লোকের সাথে online connect করছি, কিন্তু পাশে বসে একটা চা খাওয়ার মানুষ নেই।

এই ভাবনা থেকেই মাথায় একটা simple idea এলো।
What if আমরা নিজের নিজের locality-র মধ্যে একটা small group বানাই?
নতুন লোকেদের সাথে introduce হই,
কোনো pressure ছাড়া,
কোনো dating agenda ছাড়া—
just মানুষ হিসেবে মানুষকে চেনা।
Adda, coffee, evening walk, random discussions—
slowly একটা real friend circle তৈরি হতে পারে।
আর honestly, একটা ভালো circle অনেক সময় therapy থেকেও বেশি কাজ করে।
For example,
আমি থাকি College Street এলাকায়।
এখানে যদি like-minded মানুষ মিলে একটা local group করি—
students, working professionals, introverts, extroverts—সবাই welcome—
তাহলে কেন ভালো কিছু শুরু হতে পারে না?
No fancy rules.
No toxicity.
Just basic human connection.

• Comment করো তুমি কোন locality তে থাকো
• Or বলো—তুমি join করতে interested কিনা

1q6n4bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1q6n4bq/what_options_do_i_have_if_i_cant_tolerate/,What options do I have if I can’t tolerate allopurinol or febuxostat?,"Hi everyone. I’m dealing with gout from hyperuricemia and I’m stuck in a situation where the two main uric acid medicines keep wrecking my stomach. I know this isn’t medical advice, but I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve actually been through something similar and found a workable path.

My uric acid was around 8.2 mg/dL when this started, so I went to a rheumatologist and was put on allopurinol. Soon after starting, I developed stomach discomfort, changes in stool/urine, and the worst symptom was upper stomach burning and fullness. When I reported this, the doctor said it wasn’t from allopurinol, but the symptoms matched what I later saw listed as common side effects. I still continued for about 3 months, but eventually the stomach issues became unbearable.

It got to a point where I couldn’t tolerate spicy or acidic foods, and even things like lemon water, tea/coffee, or very hot drinks would trigger symptoms. I went to a gastroenterologist, had an endoscopy, and it showed gastritis. I did treatment and diet control, and it took almost one year to recover about 80%. Even now I’d say I’m only 70–80% recovered, not fully back to normal.

During all this, my gout symptoms didn’t magically disappear. I made big lifestyle changes: I avoided meat, tried low purine and low carb, and I lost about 15 kg. That helped bring my uric acid down from 8.2 to 6.8 at one point, but my symptoms still didn’t fully go away. Over time, I regained weight, and now my uric acid usually floats around \~7.2 mg/dL even with decent diet control. For me, I only feel properly better when uric acid goes below \~5.5 mg/dL.

The bigger issue now is my knees. I have knee pain, a burning sensation around the knees, and a clicking sound when I walk, and it feels like it’s getting worse over time. I’m scared I’m slowly losing my ability to walk comfortably.

I tried febuxostat too. It actually gave me relief, but it also triggers my stomach problems, and my gastritis-type symptoms come back when I take it. I also tried probenecid (uric acid excretion through urine) and it didn’t help me. I tried some blood pressure meds that supposedly have a secondary effect on uric acid and they didn’t help either. I also tried a blood sugar medication that was said to help uric acid (I don’t remember the name), but that didn’t work for me too. I’ve tried the “take an antacid/PPI in the morning and then introduce the uric acid drug” approach as well, and that still didn’t make it tolerable.

Before anyone says “just see a doctor,” I’ve already seen 3–4 rheumatologists and 2–3 gastroenterologists. The consistent response has been: these are the main drugs available and there isn’t much else they can do. That’s why I’m posting here.

One odd thing: I donate blood every 2–3 months, and I get about one symptom-free day after donating. I have no clue why, but it’s consistent. I’ve also tried a bunch of non-med options like tart cherry, juices, etc. It helps a little sometimes, but never enough unless uric acid drops below my “good zone.”

So my question is mainly for people who cannot tolerate allopurinol or febuxostat (especially due to gastritis/stomach issues). What helped you? Did you find any strategy to make ULT tolerable (splitting doses, micro-dosing, timing, brand changes, pairing with a different stomach med, anything)? Are there any alternatives that actually worked in real life? And also, did anyone discover their knee symptoms were partly something else, even though uric acid was high?

Any help or shared experiences would mean a lot. I’m honestly worried about my knees getting weaker month by month and I’m trying to find a way forward.

**Why This Pick?**

The Canadiens have won their last 5 straight meetings with the Flames, and with Calgary being just 6-13-2 on the road, I like the home squad’s chances. After watching Montreal take down the Hurricanes in Carolina and the Panthers in Florida last week, I have a feeling tonight's visitors will be light work. My money’s on the Canadiens to bag a win without the need for OT.

I have a request from our runDisney family. This weekend was supposed to be my fifth Disney marathon. This past year I was diagnosed with cancer. I had already purchased my marathon bib for this weekend. I have been trying to get myself the strength to make it to race weekend even just for the fun. I have realized and have had to make the decision this morning to cancel the trip and won’t be able to go this weekend. I’m pretty devastated - runDisney means so much to me as to all of us.

I am wondering if anyone would be willing to purchase me the marathon magnet and coffee cup at the expo for me? I was hoping to add it to my collection. I am of course willing to pay the shipping cost and product cost. It would mean so much to me.

I’m very thankful to be doing much better with my diagnosis, but have been feeling the effects of everything in my body.

For reference, we used to work together for about 5 years, during which time she mentored me and we developed a professional friendship.  Even after we no longer worked together, she threw me a baby shower with a bunch of former coworkers and we keep in touch with quarterly coffee or dinner/drinks.  I would not classify us as ""close friends"" though.

She told me about a position opening that would work directly for her.  Prior to its posting, we had candid discussions about the job, to gauge whether it would be a good fit, and she shared that she would really love to have me in that role.  Since those conversations, I have: learned I am pregnant, applied for the job, and now have an interview next week.  I am 12 weeks along.  I am wondering whether I should disclose to her my pregnancy?  

From a legal perspective, I know it is advised to not disclose pregnancy to an interviewer to avoid discrimination and implicit biases.  However, I am struggling with not disclosing because of the personal relationship we have.  I feel like I am hiding something if I wait until I get an offer and then thrust the news upon her that I'd be going on leave starting July.

Once I reached college, I had tea and biscuits. After a while, Prashant arrived and we had some casual chit-chat before heading to our respective classes.

1q6mv0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1q6mv0o/my_loose_opinion_about_the_game/,My loose opinion about the game,"So... I recently started another playthrough, because my completionist ass couldn't bare the fact, that I missed 2 achievements.

I often see only 2 opinions on this game. It's either the worst shit someone ever saw or the greatest game and why people don't like it. And I think I'm in the middle here (I guess there's a lot of people like me, but sadly I can't really see middle opinions too much).

I have few things I want to comment.

First thing is I personally think that graphicly game is beautiful. Locations are amazing from the pure estethic point of view. I really like the fact that we could finally see some locations we could only read about in previous games. Let's be real here, games often talk about things and then we can't see shit. So I actually appriciate locations like Arlathan forest etc. All of the locations in game have their own vibe, they don't feel like too much, like empty maps, like you don't know what you actually supposed to do there. Inquisition (as much as I love this game) is a perfect example of those kind of maps.

Soundtrack felt amazing too. They nicely incorporated the music from Inquisition in some moments, some music sound like from The Witcher too. I really like this part of game too.

Main story was really good. Say what you want. It didn't felt like there should be something more, like you lost some quests in the middle. We had villains, who actually were  visible in game more than once. Great voice acting, same with character visuals. Although I would want to see more of them, but I'm always more biased to see villains in games, so it's just my personal taste.

And for the companion quests I don't really have much to say, but the companions are a different type of tea.

They just made them flat. Some of them had so much potential, but it was... unused? Most of them was a one trait guys. Taash character got the most hate and I personally think it was well deserved. Not because they were nonbinary, but because they took all the stereotypes they could and pushed it in one character. They basically have no personality apart from liking dragons and being nonbinary. I kind of couldn't bare their quests, because I just knew what was it about, how it ends and what would be said. (and let me add here that they made terrible job with polish translation about non binary stuff. Like they did so much crazy language flips that I wasn't sure what langauge I was reading in some places...) Totally predictable. No depth at all. Same with rest of the group. Lucanis with his coffee.. Like we know. He likes coffee. He need it to not fall a sleep, but was it really so necessary to add the ""I need coffee/Coffee this/Coffee that"" in every scene with him? Does Davrin needed to seat even in our gatherings with his wood thing and can we talk about one, just one another thing with him than gryphons?

Dialogues, apart form main quests, not all the time, but mostly felt flat too. Something was wrong with it and I can't really put my finger where exactly.

And Rook. Don't get me wrong, I liked my Rooks, but you couldn't really made them yours. I thought that Inquisition had weak emotional reactions, but Veilguard had non at all from Rook. Always nice, never screamed... Like you fight with 2/3 gods of yours, the world almost see some apocalypse and Rook is just... there. Almost no reaction to anything. Just reading the dialog.  Maybe I'm biased, but I personally think Inquisitor would be a better protagonist for Veilguard. It would feel more natural.

And I'm mad that the previous world states didn't really matter. I feel like the game was made with half of the effort it should get.

It's a good game overall, but a pretty weak Dragon Age game.

That's it I think. I just wanted to say it somewhere.

I thought it was acute gastritis maybe triggered by a course of ibuprofen and antibiotics. At this point in time I also had low ferritin and low hbc.   

Spoke to my GP, was mostly fobbed off and my symptoms improved with OTC gastro resistant tablets (nexium). 

Over the past year I’ve had recurrence of the sharp stomach pains, indigestion and heartburn symptoms. I’ve gone on health kicks, cutting out coffee changing up my diet a bit and I am also no longer anaemic so feeling a lot better generally. 

Followed up with my GP (a more helpful one), who tested for h pylori and also recommended coeliac bloods. Both tests were negative. 

I was also put on omeprazole. Which I took on and off and then following another episode took it consistently for the past few months. Initially it helped but then I had another recurrence. 

Usually talking omeprazole prevents me from getting sharp pains. But when they came back I was like I need to try something else, so I decided to eliminate gluten. I also stopped taking omeprazole. 

Probably been around a week now. Initially I wasn’t taking it that seriously, for example I decided to eat one small  shortbread piece after avoiding GF for a couple days cos I was like what’s one shortbread I’m still low gluten. 

Next day I woke up, the sharp stomach pains which had been subsiding returned. Anyway the past week of no gluten my indigestion/heartburn and pains have all improved. For a while I was struggling to drink coffee without getting stomach aches or pains after but this week I’ve been fine. 

I know there is a possibility for coeliac serology to be negative but the disease to still be present? Also I can’t exactly remember my diet at the time of testing I wasn’t deliberately excluding gluten but it’s possible I was fairly low gluten as I was dealing with indigestion and my diet was a bit restricted. 

I realise this is a bit rambly and long, I’m just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience? Or if coeliacs can weigh in on how quickly people notice alleviation or return of stomach symptoms from gluten? 

I have a follow up with my GP end of Jan. probably going to ask for a referral for endoscopy as I want to rule out anything structural as it’s been an ongoing issue. Now of course I’m also curious if it’s coeliac ? I think they also test for that in endoscopy. 

Or possible non coeliac gluten sensitivity?  But I’m also not sure what that means.

I noticed a lot of caffeine trackers and sleep analysis tools are mainly just iPhone apps with a basic watch companion which are usually included with their premium version. 

Caffeine Curfew is watch first. You can log drinks and check your caffeine levels without your phone nearby. Making the actual habit of tracking your caffeine intake much easier. 

It syncs directly to Apple health and you are able to log caffeine directly to Apple Health from your watch. 

The watch app also calculates real time caffeine decay based on your personal settings. 

The app is completely free to use, but I do offer a pro tier with a few additional features. 

Just drop a comment of a feature you would love implemented and I’ll dm you a lifetime code!  I’d appreciate any feedback as I’m new to Apple Watch development!

If you want to skim or skip this, I describe my present situation after the \*\*\* below.**

I was basically a complete shut-in in high-school, with heavy social anxiety and other issues. But around the time I turned 19, I started rebuilding my life more or less from scratch. I went to events pretending I was just a guy with a normal life behind me, and no one seemed to mind.

There was one girl at this time who I quickly fell in love with. She was occassionally very affectionate with me, and sometimes outright flirty, however she openly identified as a lesbian. I know there were several other guys in this circle who had very similar experiences with her, and for at least one it went a lot further, as she had an inofficial, very messy and unequal situationship with him causing a lot of pain and drama. Of course I realised already then that her behaviour was rather manipulative, but I wouldn’t stop hoping, holding on to her mixed signals, and perhaps in some way I enjoyed the noble suffering of it.

Eventually I got over her, at about the same time as I started university, the year I turned 21. She disappeared from our circles for a while, then came back half a year later, and seemed a completely different person to me. Somehow I felt neither anger or attraction. We kept hanging out as friends occasionally, but these days I’ve more or less lost touch with her.

In my first term at university, I came to know another girl in my class. We started talking on the first day, and on the second she suggested getting coffee, and we ended up hanging around town for hours. This kept going over the weeks that followed. Our relationship was on the face of it platonic, chaste, not exactly flirty, but rather intense and intimate, with long walks in town and hanging out at cafés. She seemed very keen on getting to know me in particular, while not socialising much with others in the class, so I took it as a tentative romantic courtship. For the first few months at university I still lived with my parents a town over and commuted, as I was searching for accomodation. She on the other hand lived at her great-uncle’s house in a village just outside town. In other words, we were both waiting to get our own place and I saw no natural way of escalating things. A couple of months in, covid restrictions became harsher and all classes were moved online. The girl and I still kept in touch by texting every other day or so. Eventually we both got our own accomodation, I moved to town and we went for coffee again.

This is roughly what happened in the month or so that followed: I invited her to dinner at my place, as she had explicitly asked me to do, but once we got around to it she seemed like a stranger to me, polite and distant, as if she just wanted to get over with it. Later, we planned an outing together around the time of my birthday, again much on her initiative, where she made pancakes and tea for us, and I would take us out to the sea in my car, about an hour’s drive away. On our way there, she casually revealed that she had been seeing another guy in our class for about a month’s time. I kept my face up for the rest of the drive, but once we had sat down with the tea and pancakes, I told her what I had believed about the direction of our own relationship. She reacted with respect, but completely denied that she had ever thought of me that way. We talked for a long time, most of it probably right past each other. I drove her back to town and dropped her off at her place. We decided to meet again after the upcoming Christmas break, and think things over until then. When we met again she seemed avoidant of the topic, as if she wanted to hang out and pretend like nothing had happened. We got into a quarrel as I wanted answers from her. I felt my own romantic interest disappearing in real time. At one point she mentioned by way that she had dumped the other guy after coming back to town just the day before. We never hung out again after this.

My feelings for her were gone immediately, but that also made me realise to what degree she had been a blank canvas for my own ideas of romantic success. I had been a lot more infatuated with the idea of our relationship, as a final puzzle piece that would complete my catching-up in life, than I had been with her as a person. This was very different from the passionate suffering I had felt for the previous girl. This time it was the plainness and apparent predictability that I wanted, but how I was fooled! Regardless of what one might think of this girl’s behaviour and motives, the story still fills me with dread because of what I fear it says about me, that perhaps I was the narcissist.

The spring that followed was marked by covid-restrictions, so I didn’t meet much new people, but kept in touch with my friends from before. Restrictions were eased by autumn, but then I was taking a new course that I hated and I felt zero chemistry with anyone in it. For the three terms that followed, I went back to studying literature and history, which I enjoyed a lot more, but there was very little social cohesion in these classes. Despite the subjects, I felt like I had very little in common with my classmates, and I think they mostly felt the same for me and for each other. This did not really change in the following two years when I stayed for my master’s degree, in a class of only eight people, but I had some other social outlets.

In the final term for my bachelor’s degree, when I was 23, I joined the board of a student club that was ran by some acquaintances of mine from before. This has really improved my social life and general prospects over the last three years, but nothing has come of it in terms of close relationships.

When I was 22 I downloaded Tinder, but felt rather alienated about it. I kept collecting matches now and then like pokemon cards, but felt like I had nothing to say to most of them. When I actually did write to them, they often didn’t respond, or our exchanges died quickly and the thought of actually meeting up with someone from there felt very foreign to me. It took an entire year, until I was 23, when a girl I matched with wrote to me right away, and we eventually decided to meet up. She brought me home, and became my first kiss and sexual experience of any kind. It went well, even though I was perhaps a little overwhelmed and awkward, but she seemed to enjoy it anyway. I wanted to see her again, and we kept chatting for a while, but things got in the way and then she ended up with someone else. Still, I was glad that it happened. A couple of months later I met another girl on Tinder and brought her home to my place, but this time it felt rather contrived and performative for both of us I think, and we didn’t meet again either. Half a year or so went by before I went on a date with a third girl from Tinder. There clearly wasn’t much attraction between us, but we met two more times mostly out of politeness. Nothing physical ever came of it. Since then I haven’t dated anyone else.

**\*\*\***

I have a relatively active and varied social life, and I would say I am generally well liked and respected among people, sometimes almost to the point of being put on a pedestal by both men and women. While I have plenty of loose friends and acquaintances, I have never been anyones best friend or top priority, and even the most intimate friendships that I have put the most work into have always felt rather precarious. Eventually they find a partner, and there is not much need for me anymore. It happens now and then that I get into flirty relationships with girls at parties and the like, sometimes repeatedly over years with the same girls, but it never gets to more than that, there is always something in the way. Surprisingly often, it is because they turn out to be lesbian and flirt with me just for fun or whatever, like the first girl I described from years ago.

I just don’t understand what I’m doing so differently from anyone else that I have not been able to even begin a single romantic relationship over all my adult years, despite not lacking social ability in other respects. My previous experiences, as I have described them above, have not always been great, but I don’t see anything particularly unique or unusual about them either. Most people have experienced similar things or worse, and they still keep falling in love with each other. I leave all these details in the hope that someone might see some pattern that I myself simply can’t.

**TL;DR: I have had no real romantic life despite being all around well-liked and social. There have been some bad experiences, but nothing out of the ordinary. I can't see any real pattern to it myself, but something is clearly not working.**",1,1767809119.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I’m struggling with my Sage Barista Touch Impress, and the main issue is that I cannot get the espresso to start flowing at the intended \~7-second mark, no matter what I do.

According to Sage, the shot should begin flowing after roughly 7 seconds of pre-infusion.

In my case, that never happens:

	•	On a given grind setting, the coffee usually starts flowing after \~4 seconds

	•	If I go one single grind step finer, the shot barely drips or doesn’t flow at all

	•	There is no “sweet spot” where it actually starts flowing around 7 seconds

What makes this even more confusing is the massive inconsistency:

	•	Same beans

	•	Same dose

	•	Same grind setting

	•	Freshly roasted coffee (very recent roast date)

Yet on the exact same grind (e.g. 14):

	•	One shot flows fine

	•	The next shot chokes or barely drips

	•	Nothing else changes

The result is espresso that’s almost always slightly bitter, and dialing in feels impossible because the machine jumps from “too fast” to “completely choked” with a single grind step.

Has anyone else experienced this with the Touch Impress?

Is the grinder really this coarse-stepped or inconsistent?

Or is there something fundamentally off with the calibration or pressure control?

Any insight would be appreciated — at this point I’m genuinely unsure whether this is user error or a machine issue.

Everyone keeps flexing their “discipline” and “focus” online like it’s some elite muscle you’re either born with or magically build by brute force. But here’s what most productivity influencers won’t tell you: focus isn’t just about willpower or discipline. It’s actually about managing your brain’s chemistry. The people who seem effortlessly focused? They’re not grinding harder. They’ve just figured out how to tilt the neurochemical odds in their favor.

This post is the breakdown you probably haven’t seen in your TikTok algorithm. No hype. No hustle bro quotes. All researched from the best science-backed sources — like Andrew Huberman’s podcast episodes, Cal Newport’s books, peer-reviewed psychology papers and even neuroscience studies published in Nature and the Journal of Neuroscience. Too much of what we see on Instagram and YouTube Shorts is either oversimplified, misquoted, or just made to go viral. So here’s what really helps.

These ideas helped thousands of people stop blaming themselves for being “lazy” and actually work with their biology. You’re not broken. You’ve just been playing the wrong game.

Here’s what actually moves the needle:

- Dopamine is the start button for focus. It’s not a “reward chemical,” like people say. As Dr. Anna Lembke explains in *Dopamine Nation*, it’s the motivation chemical. It spikes *before* you start working, not after. That’s why starting a task feels impossible when you’ve been swiping TikTok or doomscrolling Reddit. You’re frying your baseline dopamine. Fix: reduce high-dopamine habits (like mindless scrolling) before you try to focus. Use “dopamine fasting” windows — even just 30 minutes of boredom — to reset your baseline.

- Control your environment like a chemist. Attention is environment-sensitive. A 2023 study from the University of California, Irvine showed that it takes an average of 23 minutes to refocus after a distraction. Design your environment to reduce dopamine-draining temptations: phone in another room, tabs closed, open only one window at a time. This isn’t moral discipline. It’s neurochemical hygiene. 

- Use your visual system to trigger alertness. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains that your eyes are extensions of your brain. Focusing your gaze on a single point (called “visual anchoring”) can increase your internal focus. Try this: when you start a task, look at a specific object or spot — a coffee mug, a dot on your screen — for 30 seconds without shifting your gaze. This tells your brain “we’re locking in now.”

- Ultradian rhythms are better than hustle. Your body has 90-minute focus-rest cycles. According to sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman, working in 90-minute bursts followed by 15-20 minutes of rest mirrors your natural ultradian rhythm. This method works better than grinding for hours. You’ll feel less drained and can focus longer without willpower battles.

- Novelty hijacks your attention. When something’s new, your brain releases more dopamine to explore it. This is why learning a new app or browsing Reddit feels more exciting than doing unfinished work. But you can hijack that back. Try “novelty sandwiching”: start your work session with something slightly new, a different font, a new playlist, a rewritten headline of your to-do list. Use novelty as a trigger instead of a trap.

- Caffeine only works if your sleep is decent. A 2021 study in *Nature Neuroscience* found that caffeine doesn’t recreate focus in the sleep-deprived. It just makes you feel alert while your brain is still fogged. Caffeine works best when your adenosine system (the fatigue sensor) isn’t overloaded. So honestly, the best focus hack is this: go to bed 90 minutes earlier.

- Avoid context-switching. Every time you switch tasks, your brain has to reload information. This is called “attention residue,” and it dramatically lowers working memory and output. Cal Newport explains in *Deep Work* that batching similar tasks or using time blocks prevents that cognitive tax. It’s not the number of hours you work, but how *fragmented* those hours are.

- Music is chemistry. Silence isn’t always best. A 2020 study from Applied Cognitive Psychology found that lo-fi beats and ambient music improved focus during repetitive tasks. The best combo: instrumental, medium tempo, and no lyrics. Try the “low stimulation” playlists from Endel or Brain.fm. Use music to funnel your emotional state into a working state.

- Low blood sugar = low focus. A drop in glucose can tank your working memory and increase irritability. This is why you can feel “brain dead” at 3 PM. Keep slow-digesting carbs and protein in your system. Not Snickers. Think nuts, Greek yogurt, oatmeal. A small protein-heavy snack can restore mental clarity in under 20 minutes.

- Use “starting rituals” to trick your brain. The hardest part is getting started. So instead of relying on motivation, use a ritual. Same hoodie. Same location. Same drink. When your brain sees the cues, it begins to auto-activate the work mode pattern. James Clear calls this “habit stacking” in *Atomic Habits*. Make the process stupidly easy to begin. Like “open laptop, type one sentence, sip coffee.” Then you’re off.

- Mental fatigue is real, not weakness. A 2022 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin* confirmed that mental exhaustion isn’t just boredom or laziness. After long focus periods, the prefrontal cortex runs low on synaptic resources. That’s why breaks, walks, low-intensity movement, and even naps improve cognitive performance. The brain needs fuel and recovery, just like muscles.

- Don’t just block distractions, *replace* them. Cold-turkey social media detoxes rarely work. Your brain needs a replacement source of stimulation. Try a “boredom menu” — keep a short list of low-stimulation but enjoyable offline activities: reading fiction, sketching, walking. When you feel the urge to scroll, swap it. Rewire your reward system instead of just suppressing it.

- Use boredom as a workout. Chronic overstimulation is wrecking your brain’s tolerance for effort. But you can rebuild it by doing “deliberate boredom training.” One technique from researcher Dr. Gloria Mark’s book *Attention Span*: stare out a window with no phone or distractions for 10 minutes a day. That small resistance increases your baseline focus tolerance over time.

- Your thoughts aren’t always facts. Meta-awareness matters. You don’t need to “clear your mind.” You just need to notice when it wanders and bring it back. That’s focus. Meditation strengthens this loop. A review in *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience* found that just 8 minutes of daily mindfulness practice improves sustained attention and reduces default mode network activity — the part responsible for daydreaming and mental time-travel.

You’re not broken or doomed to be scattered. Focus is not a character trait. It’s a system of brain chemistry, environment, and habits. If you set it up right, focus stops being a battle. It becomes automatic. And the people who seem like they were “born disciplined”? They’re just playing the chemistry game a little smarter.

Chaos ensues as the world governments and corporations scramble to complete ancient prophecies in an attempt to defeat Torgrim. One such prophecy involves a sword wedged in a stone in a park just outside Andy’s office, where, despite wishing he could just keep working through the apocalypse, Andy finds himself summoned along with the rest of the city. There, in front of thousands of orcs, trolls, and elves, Andy frees the sword in his first attempt. 



Still sporting his loafers and company polo, Andy soon learns that freeing the sword is only the beginning of a prophecy ten thousand years in the making. He faces off against elder gods, cryptic cathedrals, and undead legions, wondering what will run out first: his combined time off, or his luck.

They were waiting for me with coffee, and somehow the conversation turned to their kid. They told me they’d always wanted a baby, tried for years… and nothing worked. It was really hard for them, but they eventually decided to look at adoption “just to see"". Most people in the center were crowding around the babies, but in a corner, there was this tiny 18-month-old girl in a little wheelchair. Quiet, watching everyone. The file said she had a physical disability and was “hard to place.” Most people skip kids like her. My friends looked at each other, smiled, and said, “That’s our kid.” They brought her home. Life changed ramps instead of cribs, therapy instead of playdates, learning as they went. But the house finally felt alive in a way it hadn’t before. And now?

I (29M) am looking to make serious progress this year, but I’ve realized that staying consistent is much harder when you're only holding yourself accountable. That’s why I’m looking for three other men in Utrecht to form a small, tight-knit group of four to go **""locked-in""** together for 2026.

**The Idea:** No vague coffee chats, but a serious accountability group focused on:

* **Fitness:** Pushing each other on physical goals and discipline.
* **Career/Entrepreneurship:** Sparring on professional growth and business opportunities.
* **Mental Growth:** Reflection, focus, and maintaining a sharp mindset.

**The Vibe:** I’m looking for the drive and discipline of the ""locked-in"" mindset, but without the toxic masculine clichés. No ""alpha"" talk—just radical honesty and genuine support. We hold each other accountable when things get tough and celebrate each other's wins.

**Practicalities:** I’m looking for guys who are in a similar stage of life (late 20s / early 30s) and live in or around Utrecht. The goal is to have regular check-ins (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly), meet up physically for a workout or a deep-dive session, and have a group chat for daily discipline.

Are you seriously working on your own path and looking for that extra 10% by surrounding yourself with like-minded people?

Send me a DM with a short intro about yourself and what your goals are for this year. Let’s get to work.

Hey everyone,

I’m a Spurs fan based in Canada and I’ll be visiting family in Thailand soon. On the way back, I have an ~11 hour layover in London, so I’m planning to make the most of it and finally visit the stadium.

Here’s my rough plan:
	•	Land at Heathrow around 6:00 AM
	•	Expect to be out of the airport by ~7:00 AM (already checked in, just a backpack)
	•	Stadium tour booked for 10:30 AM
	•	Flight out of London is at 5:00 PM
	•	Planning to be back at Heathrow by ~2:00 PM to keep things stress-free

I’m looking for recommendations on a couple of things:

	1.	What’s the best way to kill time between ~8:00 AM and 10:30 AM?
Is it best to just hang around the stadium / Tottenham area (coffee, walking around, photos, murals, etc.), or is there something nearby you’d recommend that’s easy and low-key?

	2.	Is there anything else worth seeing close to the stadium, or would you suggest sticking strictly to the Spurs area given the time window?

	3.	Any realistic chance of seeing players arriving for training, or is that unlikely / not really a thing?

Safety-wise, I’ll be travelling solo with my backpack and documents (passport, etc.). I live in Toronto, so I’m used to basic big-city awareness (front pockets, zipped bag, etc.). I’m of South Asian origin(Indian/Pakistani), in case that’s relevant at all.

Would really appreciate any local advice — especially from people who know the area well.
Thanks in advance! COYS 🤍

Are you afraid of being rejected by the parents-in-law? Have you been dumped for not having a good relationship with your lover’s family? 

Don’t fret, expert in-law whisperer Ilya Rozanov is here to walk us through his full-proof 10 step guide to win over any sort of parental unit. 

**Step 1:** Wear a t-shirt of their most ‘hated’ sports team. It’s a conversation starter. Tells them you’re here to stay, even if your favorite team may be their favorite team’s worst nightmare. 

**Step 2:** Greet them politely (Hi! Or Hello!) and stand behind your lover. Fill in the blanks when s/he’s struggling to put a name to your relationship. This informs them that you’re at the same place in the relationship with their child. And that you want to be present to meet them. 

**Step 3:** Accept and sip a cup of weak coffee or tepid water, even if you’re a chilled coke or vodka kinda guy. 

**Step 4:** Politely respond to all their questions and concerns. Be honest and open. Correct your lover’s responses, as needed (example: When did it all begin? Rookie Season vs. Summer Before). Mumble responses to questions you and your lover do not want to respond to, yet. Follow your lover’s lead. 
 
**Step 5:** Complement their vodka/alcoholic offerings. Try to form a genuine connection with your lover’s parents, however boring they may be in real life. 

**Step 6:** Be supportive of your lover’s responses. His or her parents will appreciate the fact that you’ve got their child’s back. Be honest about how you feel about their son or daughter. If you love your lover, let it be known. Do not hide behind words, especially if you’ve left loads of broken hearts in cities across the continent.

**Step 7:** While your lover may have stepped away to deal with one parent, help the other parent with meal prep. You could discuss things that you’ve learned about them during earlier chats with your lover (Some handy topics for reference: Treasury Board of Canada, McGill University, The New Yorker, Pasta Recipes and Grated vs. Shaved Parmesan). 

**Step 8:** Relish your home cooked meal. Eat 14 portions of pasta if you have to. Show them how committed and excited you are to be among family. 

**Step 9:** Tell them you’re more than happy to move to another country to be with their one and only child, even if it means you uproot and upend your life and career. It shows them you’re loyal to their son or daughter over anything else in life. 

**Step 10:** Step up and calm your lover with words and actions in case he or she begins to have a panic attack or an anxiety attack. Rub their back, allay their fears, give them a chaste kiss and don’t be afraid to call yourself the ‘B’ word. The Boyfriend. Something you may have never done in the past. Your lover’s parents will immediately pick up on the fact that you are uniquely qualified to take care of their son or daughter. And may have even helped him or her through a freak out episode in the past.  

If nothing else works, watch a game with them on television and compare performance notes. If they claim to be sports enthusiasts, they’ll listen to what you’ve gotta say. You’re Ilya Rozanov after all. 

If it all fails, you may need to steer the discussion to the performance of the Buffalo team.

I’d just gotten out of my first terrible “adult” relationship and my very first friend I’d made while in college made a Facebook post on that page basically advertising me like a piece of furniture on Marketplace without my knowing, trying to find me a new guy. I lived in a dorm during the school year and stayed at my mom’s trailer house 2 hours north during the summers so I’d have a ride to my summer jobs (didn’t have a car at the time) and get to spend some time with her. We messaged back and forth on Facebook for a few months and got along well. I really liked how his brain worked. Don’t remember the content of the conversations, just that they were really great conversations.

I went to visit him one day in 2013 back when we first met, but that day, he wasn’t off of work yet when I arrived by train, so I roamed around where we were supposed to meet (local coffee shop) for a few hours and started being followed by a weird drunk guy. Walked into a local grocery store at 7 p.m., noticed the drunk still following me, and pretended like I was actually shopping because I felt anxious and didn’t know what else to do. I had like $20 to my name, so I bought a retirement card and gave it to my future husband that night, told him what happened before he arrived, and ever since then, we’ve only ever given each other cards that have no relation to the occasion/holiday as an inside joke.

After that, were on and off for years since we met at a time when we were both on our own paths (being young college kids from poor backgrounds and trying to figure out pretty much everything on our own). We stayed in touch through the years and grew to love each other during the hardest times in both our lives, even though we couldn’t “be” together during all of it.

We finally got married in September 2024. On our first wedding anniversary, we unknowingly got each other the same card at different stores in different towns at different times and both had a good laugh together about it, so thought it’d be worth sharing. He’s my best friend and I am grateful to be his partner and proud of the person that he became.

Turns out, I wasn't broken just wired differently. After diving deep into research from psychologists, neuroscientists and industry experts, plus testing everything on myself, I figured out what actually makes introverts thrive. Not survive, thrive. This isn't about fixing yourself or forcing extroversion. It's about working with your brain not against it.

# 1. Stop Apologizing for Your Energy Management Style

Your battery drains differently. Science backs this up. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney's research in The Introvert Advantage shows introverts literally process stimulation through longer neural pathways, using more acetylcholine (the stay focused and chill neurotransmitter) versus dopamine (the let's party one). This means you're not antisocial or boring you're just operating on a different neurological system.

Practical move Start treating alone time like a legitimate appointment. Block it on your calendar. Tell people you have plans (you do, with yourself). The podcast Quiet The Power of Introverts by Susan Cain breaks down why this matters. Cain, who gave one of the most viewed TED talks ever and spent seven years researching introversion, makes it clear that solitude isn't selfish it's necessary maintenance.

Set boundaries without guilt. I need to recharge tonight is a complete sentence. People who matter will get it. People who don't aren't your people.

# 2. Design Your Social Life Like a Strategic Game

Quality over quantity isn't just a cliche it's survival strategy. Research from Oxford evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar shows humans max out at about 150 meaningful connections, but introverts thrive with way fewer, deeper bonds. Stop forcing yourself into group hangs that drain you and invest in one on one connections.

I use an app called Ash for relationship coaching. It's basically therapy lite that helps you figure out which connections actually matter and how to nurture them without burning out. The app won a bunch of design awards and was created by therapists who understand that not everyone needs 47 group chats to feel fulfilled.

Here's what works Schedule social time when your energy is highest (usually not after work) pick activities with built in structure (movie then dinner gives you conversation breaks), and don't stack social plans back to back. You're not flaky for needing recovery time between hangouts.

Also find your introvert third spaces. Not loud bars, think coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, hiking trails. Places where you can be around people without being ON. The book ""Quiet Power"" by Susan Cain (yes her again she's the introvert queen) has great frameworks for this.

# 3. Career Path: Play to Your Actual Strengths

The modern workplace is built for extroverts, open offices and constant collaboration and ""synergy."" Exhausting. But introverts have legit advantages. You're better at deep focus, independent problem solving, thoughtful communication, and pattern recognition. Leverage that instead of trying to out extrovert everyone.

Research from Wharton professor Adam Grant found introverts often make better leaders because they actually listen and empower their teams instead of dominating conversations. His work shows introverted CEOs of proactive teams had higher profits than their extroverted counterparts.

Negotiate for what you need: remote work options, quiet workspace, email communication over constant meetings, advance notice for presentations. Don't just suffer through. Companies are slowly realizing different work styles exist.

The book ""Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" by Susan Cain is legitimately the best thing I've ever read on this. She's a former corporate lawyer who went through hell in extrovert dominated environments before researching this for years. The book hit #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and won multiple awards. It completely reframed how I see my work style.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI specialists from Google, it pulls from vetted sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to create podcasts tailored to your goals.

For introverts looking to build career skills or understand their wiring better, BeFreed lets you customize both the depth (10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples) and the voice style. The sarcastic narrator option makes dense psychology research way more digestible during your commute. You can type in something like ""become a better listener"" or ""understand introvert leadership styles,"" and it generates content specifically for that, complete with a structured learning plan that evolves based on what you engage with. The app includes all the books mentioned here plus tons more, and you can pause mid-podcast to ask questions or explore tangents. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous growth without the brain fog of doomscrolling.

Check out the YouTube channel ""Psych2Go"" too. They have solid science backed content on introvert strengths in professional settings, super digestible format.

# 4. Build a Recharge Routine That Actually Works

Your downtime needs to be intentional, not just scrolling TikTok for three hours (guilty). Actual recharging means activities that restore your mental energy without adding stimulation.

Try the app Finch for habit building. It's a self care pet game that's way less cringe than it sounds. You set personal goals, check in daily, and your little bird grows with you. It won a Mental Health America award and helps build consistency without being preachy.

Real recharge activities: Reading (obviously), journaling, solo walks, creative hobbies, meditation, cooking, basically anything that doesn't require performance or social energy. The podcast ""On Being"" with Krista Tippett explores solitude, meaning, and inner life in ways that actually resonate instead of just throwing generic mindfulness advice at you.

Here's the thing researchers found, constant stimulation literally shrinks your ability to be alone with your thoughts. Dr. Cal Newport's work on deep work and digital minimalism shows that protecting solitude isn't just nice, it's cognitively essential. His book ""Digital Minimalism"" breaks down how to reclaim your attention in a world designed to steal it.

# 5. Reframe How You See Yourself

Society pushes this narrative that extroversion equals success, happiness, popularity. It's bullshit. Different studies show introverts and extroverts report equal life satisfaction, just from different sources. Stop measuring yourself against extrovert metrics.

Your idea of a perfect weekend might look ""boring"" to others. Who cares? You're not living their life. Some of history's most impactful people were introverts: Einstein, Rosa Parks, Bill Gates, J.K. Rowling, Barack Obama. They succeeded because of their introverted traits, not despite them.

The YouTube channel ""The School of Life"" has incredible content on self acceptance and understanding your personality without judgment. Their philosophy is accessible, not academic, and helps you build frameworks for living authentically.

Stop trying to ""overcome"" introversion. It's not a flaw. It's literally how your brain is wired. The goal isn't to become an extrovert, it's to build a life that works with your natural tendencies. That means different things for everyone, but it starts with accepting that your way of being isn't wrong, it's just different.

The real freedom comes when you stop performing extroversion and start optimizing for your actual needs. Smaller friend groups, meaningful work, intentional solitude, strategic social energy. That's not settling, that's winning on your own terms.

You don't need to be louder, you need to be more yourself. The world needs what introverts bring: depth, thoughtfulness, creativity, genuine connection. Stop trying to fit into a mold that wasn't built for you and start building a life that actually feels good.",1,1767808190.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

Then I woke up.

There were only a few minutes left before my shift started. I quickly pulled myself together, left the house, and set out.

ut the things I had seen stayed in my head all the way. In the dream, I was in a dark alley. I was running after someone. Everything was blurry, as if seen through a layer of mist. Then the woman fell. A hand rose into the air and a scream was heard.

I didn’t even remember how I got to work. Fred waved at me. My closest friend at work. We chatted a bit. I handled the routine accounting tasks.

It was a nightmare, just a nightmare.

The next night, I must have worked until about two in the morning. When I suddenly opened my eyes, I was in a secluded place, like between two buildings.  
“–Please don’t… Please… stay away.”  
I turned my head to the right. A male silhouette was lying on the ground. One hand was in the air, begging.  
“–Please…”  
The sound of a body being slashed cut off his words. Not even a scream was heard. Only the man’s last breath. I didn’t just hear it.

I felt it.

When I woke up, I was at my desk. My desk lamp was on. My alarm was ringing on the side. With difficulty I reached out and turned it off. I was probably under too much stress at work. So many reports to prepare. So many things to document. My mind was so tangled, that must have been why I was having such dreams.

So here was another normal day. I had forgotten my nightmare. Until I went to bed that evening. I waited a bit at the head of the bed.

What if I saw it again?

After lying down, I couldn’t sleep for quite a while.

Another nightmare.

This time I wasn’t outside. I was inside a house, my footsteps echoing. A woman was sitting on the couch watching TV. She didn’t notice me. I was going toward her. Even when I tensed my body to stop, nothing changed. I saw the knife in my hand raised into the air. Suddenly, I grabbed the woman’s neck and…  
It’s better if I don’t write the rest.

And again, I woke up. Covered in sweat.

What was happening to me?

I didn’t even remember how I got to work. When Fred saw me at the door, his eyes widened.  
“–Cillian, are you okay?”  
I didn’t want to worry him. I just told him I couldn’t sleep. He bought me a coffee and advised me to take a sleeping pill that night. Because of my condition, the idea of pills didn’t sound unreasonable. That night I took them and really did sleep well, relatively speaking. The next day I went to work more energetic. For the next few days I didn’t dream at all. I thought the nightmare ordeal was over.

About a week later, one night I suddenly heard crying. I was inside a huge warehouse, or somewhere like it. But this time, it was more familiar than the other places.  
It was the abandoned factory just outside the city. When the crying grew louder, I looked down. There was a man curled up on the ground. A sudden kick to his stomach made him curl up even tighter. His voice went silent. Moonlight filtered through the broken window above. I saw the glint of the knife’s sharp edge. And then, as always, I woke up.

I was a bit late to work. I ran into my grumpy boss. I was sure he was about to give me an hour-long disciplinary lecture. Luckily Fred stepped in, told him I wasn’t doing too well these days, and saved me.  
“–Thanks, man,” I said. Just as I turned to leave, he grabbed my arm.  
“–Cillian, what’s going on?”  
“What do you mean?”  
“–Coming to work sleepless, spacing out… Are you cheating on your wife?”  
“I’m not even married, Fred.”  
He laughed and slapped my shoulder.  
“–I’m joking, loosen up a bit.”  
I laughed with him. After all, he was my friend. I had no reason not to tell him what I was going through. I sat down and told him about the nightmares I’d been having. The less bloody versions, at least. By the time I finished, a thoughtful expression had settled on his face. I told him these were insignificant things. But he had taken them very seriously. In fact, I’d almost say… he was scared. He asked me a bunch of questions. What I felt in the dream, for example—not emotions, but concrete things: cold, light, humidity…

To most of them, I just said I didn’t know.

Finally, to reassure him, I added that I would see a psychologist and went back to my work.

That night on the way home, heavy rain started and lasted all night, I even remembered it while falling asleep.

And while waking up.

I could hear the rain more clearly, I was soaked. I was outside. There was a dumpster next to me. I couldn’t fully define where I was. On the edge of the sidewalk, I saw a man groaning. From his clothing, it was obvious he was homeless. He was shouting something. His collar was being grabbed and pulled up by someone. I saw that knife, the one that always ended my dreams; this time blood was dripping from its cold metal. The man whimpered in a higher pitch. The knife was about to fall and end him.

But it stopped, in mid-air, for seconds.

Suddenly I felt watched. Someone was looking at me. But I couldn’t see them. Yet I could swear.

The homeless man’s eyes shifted away from the knife, to something else.

Then the sound of the knife viciously tearing through the dirty coat roared in my ears. This time… it was different, crueler, angrier.

I woke up, shivering. I pulled the blanket over me. It was still dark outside. I thought I’d sleep a bit more.

But I was still cold. I pulled the blanket tighter. The blanket was cold too.

Something was wrong.

When I turned on the light, I nearly screamed at what I saw.

I was wet, my bed was wet. Water was dripping where I stood. Water was flowing from me. Had I taken a shower in my sleep? Or…

Realistic dreams… the sounds… the endless sleeplessness…

In my right hand, something else was dripping along with the water.

Blood.

But I wasn’t wounded.

There were stains on my pajamas too. Dotted.

I remembered the rain, how much it had poured… it had stopped now, but.

Was it a dream? Or… wasn’t it? Did I kill them? All of them…  
I had done it.

I grabbed my phone and called Fred. Told him to come to my house. He asked me a thousand times what was going on and if I was okay. I just said come.

Because he was the only one who wouldn’t call the police when he saw me like this.

When he knocked, I ran to open the door. As I had guessed, the moment he saw me he covered his mouth with his hand.  
“–You… What have you done?”  
I let him in. I was shivering because I was soaked. I had already told him about the dreams I’d been having. I told him every detail of tonight’s as well.  
“–I woke up soaking wet, Fred. And there’s blood. There’s blood on me. I’m doing this. It’s not a dream.”

His face took on the most serious expression I’d ever seen.

“–I should go to the police… I should tell everything. I’ve killed all those people. I’m a serial killer. Maybe there are more I don’t even remember.”

As I panicked, pacing around and talking, he weakly whispered my name.

“–But I wasn’t doing it willingly, I didn’t know. The bodies… I don’t remember after killing them.

He said my name again.

“–Maybe they’re in my basement, maybe I buried them all there. God… I’ve been living for days on top of so many corpses.

“–Calm down, Cillian.”

There was not the slightest panic in his voice. He was watching me pace back and forth in the room.

“How can I be? How can I calm down? I’m a serial killer, Fred! Your friend is a killer! How are you so calm?”

Until then, I hadn’t noticed. He was sitting on the couch thoughtfully. No trace of panic on his face.

“You’re not a serial killer.”

“How can you be sure? There’s blood on me. I’m soaked. I killed that man.”

“You didn’t. You watched.”

I froze in place.

“What?”

“You watched them all, Cillian. I think… you’ve always been watching.”

“How… How do you know this? How do you know I didn’t kill them?”

“Because I did.”

I stumbled back two steps in shock. Before I could comprehend what he said, he spoke again.

“I should have realized earlier. But you… you were like invisible somehow. I always felt it. I always knew I wasn’t alone with them. But when you talked about the dreams, everything became clear. Tonight I saw you, Cillian. You were watching me from the corner. Like a ghost. Then you vanished. You didn’t do it. But you watched.”

Fred stood up. He came toward me.

“I don’t know how this is happening. You… you’re some kind of Grim Reaper.”

He grabbed the bag he had thrown into the hallway when he came in. I was frozen from shock as he walked past me.

“I haven’t figured out what this is yet, Cillian. You’re not normal, you know that now. And I’m sure you won’t go to the police until you understand.”

He looked into my eyes. It gave me the exact same feeling as when I thought I was being watched. As he left, I saw the bruise marks on his arm. They were shaped like finger marks, bruising his arm. That hand… the hand that rose into the air holding the knife…

He slammed the door and left.

I still haven’t gone to the police. I don’t know what’s happening, what’s going on here. I’m writing this so maybe someone can help me. With paranormal things, or whatever field this falls into. Fred will come back for me.

And I’m afraid the last thing I’ll watch will be my own murder.",1,1767808102.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

1q6lwxk,https://i.redd.it/sdmr8t8jpybg1.jpeg,"80 minutes, 100 questions.","Passed today ""provisionally"" @ 100 questions, 80 minutes.

Background:

Been working in IT for 4 decades. I do almost no cloud stuff. Manage a couple of private cloud environments and do some IaaS/SaaS integration work, but overall exposure to public cloud infrastructures (AWS/etc) is virtually nil. Fortunately I passed the CISSP 2 1/2 weeks ago so that gives me the requisite experience to get the certification.

Winter weather advisory with freezing rain this morning, so I left extra time to get to the test center, which is normally about 60 minutes away. Oddly I encountered very little traffic-related problems getting to the test center so I was able to stop at a Panera and get a blueberry muffin and decaf coffee, and I still had 45 minutes to kill. I used the time to do some quick refresh of my notes, and of course make a comprehensive bathroom break so I wouldn't have to lose time unnecessarily with pee-breaks during the exam itself.

Went to the same testing center I used for my CISSP. You can read more about that [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/isc2/comments/1py5n0n/well_that_was_unexpected/)



Exam Experience:

Exam was very similar to the SSCP I took about 3 months ago, but with a cloud-centric focus on questions rather than a more encompassing systems generalist focus. Rather than getting a question like ""What is the BEST solution to ensure confidentiality between your company and your remote worker's PC"" you get questions akin to ""What is the BEST solution to ensure confidentiality between your remote workers and your cloud applications?""

I cannot say the exam was ""brutal"" like others have characterized it. It was definitely tricky. Some of the questions felt like they came right out of the OSG practice tests. Definitely more practitioner-based than the higher-level CISSP questions. However, I cannot say the exam got more difficult or less difficult as I progressed through it. Some questions were easier, almost gimmes (like definition questions right out of the text) and some were difficult to unwrap.

Although the questions were similar to the OSG/OPT tests, they were definitely worded differently. Right off the bat, Question #2 I had to guess on the answer because the terminology used made it practically impossible to figure out what they were asking for. I figured this was a bad omen.

Some of the questions felt... dated. Some used outright incorrect terms in the answers. As an example, from the ""Official Practice Tests"" (as to not violate the NDA):

Q. After conducting a qualitative risk assessment of her organization, Prisha decides to recommend adding a new module to the firewall that will filter out inbound malware. What type of risk response behavior is she recommending? A. Accept B. Transfer C. Reduce D. Reject

The correct answer, C, ""Reduce"", uses the wrong term. The proper term is Mitigation. I had many questions on the exam similar to this, where the wrong term was used in the answer, but not obscure enough that you couldn't figure out what the right answer was.

Similar to my [SSCP Exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSCP/comments/1nuk7og/onwards_to_the_cissp/) as the exam progressed I really didn't know how I was doing, even though I couldn't get a sense if things were getting harder or easier. I had enough questions I was fairly confident on the answer of that I didn't think I was failing, but by question 75 or so I was pretty convinced I was going to have to progress well past question 100, probably to question 150, in order to get a ""pass"".

At 80 minutes in exactly, I was at question 100. I selected my answer, clicked Next, and the survey popped up. At this point I figured I passed as I didn't think I had totally bombed the exam to the point it would end abruptly at Q100. My congrats paper was waiting for me at checkout.

  
Study Plan:

Keeping in mind that had just passed my CISSP 2 1/2 weeks ago, my study plan was pretty limited for the CCSP.

Starting on 12/27 I read the CCSP OSG cover to cover (finished Sunday evening 12/28). This was a quick read, and the content felt really light. Truthfully I think if you just use this book to pass, you'll fail. The book reads okay, it doesn't drag.

Monday 12/29 I watched almost all the LinkedIn Learning CCSP course from Cybrary. I found Mike Chappel's CCSP course as well, but it has been discontinued on LinkedIn and replaced by the one from Cybrary. I started to watch Mike's but I found the material extremely dated. Even some of the material in the Cybrary video was dated. I watched these as 2x speed, which works okay for me.

After that, I did all the chapter tests that were included in the OSG through the Wiley web site. I also purchased the offical practice tests as part of a ""set"" off amazon, so I did all the domain tests from that book online as well. As I did this, I made note of a) questions I got wrong and b) questions where I had to 'guess' on the correct answer.

Once all those exams were completed, I took my notes and manually reviewed the topics online with help from Mr. Google.

I also purchased the CSSP CBK off amazon, and based on my weakest domains from the domain tests in the OPT, I read/skimmed through each of the weak domains in the CBK.

I purchased a copy of u/GwenBettwy's  ""CCSP Cloud Guardians"" off Amazon. This is a quick read cover to cover. It was a pretty good review of what you should know. I'm not entirely sure it is aligned 100% with the current CBK, but I recommend it. Plus, if you have the opportunity, watch Gwen's ""Test Taking Tips"" video series on YouTube. I watched them for my CISSP exam, and once again, several of her tips came in handy for me today. There isn't ""one size fits all"" (e.g. the ""think like a manager"" you get when you take the CISSP) when it comes to ways to approach questions. Everything in your arsenal helps.

Finally, I had purchased a copy of Destination CCSP, as I used the Destination CISSP book for my CISSP and thought it was pretty good. However, with the OSG and the CBK, I found I didn't need the Dest CCSP book at all. Although the OSG is marginally smaller than the Dest CCSP book, the Dest CCSP book doesn't appear to contain as much material, as it has a large number of huge graphics and pictures which serve no purpose and take up 50-66% of a page at a time.

The only app-based quiz programs I used were LearnZapp and DestCert, but both of these I used very little. I did less than a dozen 10-question quizzes in the LearnZapp app (didn't feel like paying for a subscription), and I did 300 out of the 1400 questions on the Dest Cert app. After doing 2,300 questions in Dest Cert for my CISSP, I am sort of burnt out on doing these at this point. 

I find the DestCert app the best of them all, the others are good for testing your knowledge gaps. However, having used the DestCert program so much, I can sort of get a feel for which answer is correct without necessarily knowing ""why"". Plus, some of their answers are highly subjective and I do not always agree with them. But, it is a good resource for making you read lengthy questions.



Conclusion:

Relying on the CCSP study material alone probably would have made the exam a lot more difficult. Or, at a minimum, I would have had to supplement the purchased reading material by reading the reference documents (e.g. NIST RMF, ISO docs, etc.) in order to provide a more in-depth background on the material.

As an example, I received several questions on PCI-DSS. The only reason I had anything more than a cursory knowledge about PCI-DSS from the study materials was due to my wife's certification as a QSA.

Having worked my way up from CC to SSCP to CISSP over 6 months provided a solid foundation of knowledge which made this exam not overly difficult. Without that foundation I think the exam would have been much more difficult.

1q6lwtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slime/comments/1q6lwtr/how_did_i_screw_up_making_activator/,How did I screw up making activator?,"TL; DR bc I can make any short story long: can I reheat newly made activator that has already crystalized to “melt” the borax?

I’m not a total newbie, and I’ve successfully made strong-ish activator at least 8-10 times using the borax packets that shops include. I usually heat the water in the microwave until it feels hot/has steam, but at least once before last night, I’d used my upstairs electric kettle (I like tea!), set to the green tea setting, which I think is 182F. 

So I filled my intended 16oz clean container most of the way as a water “measurement,” then dumped that water into my kettle and heated. It got to 182°, and then I poured it into my container, followed quickly by pouring in the 2 borax packets, each intended to be used with 1cup water. 

I didn’t immediately put on a lid to shake, as when I did that last time, both the container and lid warped from heat, so instead, I took the open container to the bathroom and tried to swirl it over the sink as best I could without burning myself. I set it down to cool, and I’d intended to lid it to shake after 20 minutes, but my ADHD brain forgot bc I did not set a timer. 

About 2 hours later I remembered, so I went to check it. The water seemed clear, so I put on the lid to give a good shake, but in the first seconds, I could see and hear the large crystals hitting the side of the container! I reopened the container, and I could easily crumble up the crystals, but since the water was cool, none of the borax integrated with the water. As of this morning, the borax is about the size of semi-coarse ground coffee, like you’d use for cold brew. 

So now my question:
If I heat the unlidded container of “not-activator” in the microwave for a minute or so, will the reheated liquid finally mesh into usable activator? 
Or is it now unsalvageable, and I need to pour it out and start over?",1,1767807498.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend & I just moved in together & got a cuisinart coffeemaker with a grinder for Christmas, except when we opened it it was broken. So we returned it.

I’m kind of glad it was broken because I would rather have an espresso machine than a coffee machine.

We’ve never had our own machine & ultimately want something that’s good quality, reliable, & will last a long time. Doesn’t need to be super fancy so simple is fine. I guess I should add we have somewhat limited counter space so not looking for anything huge/clunky.

Now I’m trying to decide what to do with the refund we’re getting. I’ll also note that I’m only searching on Amazon as we got credit for the refund + other gift cards from the holidays. I’ll put my options/thoughts below:

1. Originally I saw a refurbished Breville Barista Express on Amazon for ~$450. I was set on this until I saw some reviews saying that it didn’t work as well refurbished, only worked for a short amount of time, etc. I originally also liked that the grinder was built in, but after doing research here I realized that’s not always ideal. Does anyone have experience with this machine or a refurbished version?

2. I’ve also saw a lot on here about the Breville Bambino plus (~$4-500). That machine seems good, but the original Breville bambino ($300) seems like a way better deal because the only difference seems to be the milk frother & water tank? If anyone has experience on the difference between these two I’d really appreciate it because the milk frother isn’t a big deal to me.

3. If I decide to go with the Breville bambino, does anyone have any grinder recommendations that are around $100-200? I don’t know much about grinders but figure they don’t have to be super fancy? My sister said she will get me a tamping kit so I’m kind of just thinking about getting a grinder.

If anyone has any recommendations I would really appreciate it! Also I know I’ve only talked about Breville so if there are other reputable brands/machines I’m 100% open to looking into that. I started with Breville because my sister told me it’s reliable & she knows a lot more about this than I do.

also at each of these hangouts she has found a very petty issue with me that caused her to not talk to me for days weeks. i will say, she had this issue before she met him. in april she didn’t talk to me for about 2 weeks because i had a short reply to a text message (she was trying to get a loan for a car and i said good luck and then she made me have a very long phone call about feelings and being heard when she decided she wanted to talk again) 

she missed my birthday celebration and went out of town, which honestly wouldn’t bother me except for the fact she actually cut off one of her friends for this exact thing! she said see would celebrate when she got back, the “celebration” was a last minute meet up at a coffee shop that lasted about 20 minutes because she was over an hour late when i told her i had to head back home at a certain time and she brought her boyfriend? 

anyways, fast forward to last week i happened to be in the mall she works in so i stopped by her job to say hi. in all honestly, she did not seem that happy to see me, we had a very short awkward conversation and i left. 

she texted me a couple days later saying we should hang out. we figure out a day, i suggest a time. now it’s crickets. i’m honestly so tired of her taking forever to reply to me, it’s been 2 days since i asked what a good time was. i see her active on social media in the meantime. 

i don’t know if i should even reply IF she ever gets back to me. i’m not even sure how i feel about hanging out. should i tell her i find her newfound lack of communication upsetting or is it not even worth my time?

[Previous post on rug size](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/1puu3ez/what_size_rug_should_i_get_8x6_or_5x7/)

I wanted to follow up on my rug size post from two weeks ago. I ended up getting a 8'x5.4' rug, which I love.

Now the question is the coffee table size.

* The green tape is 57""x27"", specifically taken from [Rove Concept Truman](http://www.roveconcepts.com/truman-coffee-table). (Not buying new, found on FB Marketplace)
* 18"" between table and couch
* 22"" between table and TV

I was following this Wayfair guide on coffee table size: [https://www.wayfair.ca/sca/ideas-and-advice/guides/coffee-table-size-guide-T5473](https://www.wayfair.ca/sca/ideas-and-advice/guides/coffee-table-size-guide-T5473)

* 2/3 length of couch. My couch is 85""; 2/3 would be 57"".
* 12""-18"" between table and couch.
* 30"" between table and TV.

So with the exception of the distance between table and TV, I think the sizing works? It does seem really massive though. And I guess it depends on the style of the coffee table, those with 4 legs vs a rectangular block like the one above? Not sure if the pictures do it justice on how big the green taped area is.

Just asking for confirmation if I'm thinking about the size correctly.",3,1767807015.0,malelivingspace,1,0.67,False

1q6lnt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1q6lnt7/anyone_else_in_austin_making_good_money_and_still/,Anyone else in Austin making “good money” and still feeling weirdly tight?,"

I’ve been trying to figure out if this is just a me thing or if it’s part of living in Austin now.

On paper, I’m doing okay. I make what people would call “good money for Austin.” Not tech-money rich, but solid. Rent gets paid, bills go through, I’m not panicking every month. When this city comes up in conversation, people still talk about it like it’s affordable compared to other big places, and maybe that used to be true. But day to day, it still feels… close.

Not in a dramatic way. More like a constant low-level tension. Utilities jump around more than I expect. Parking, tolls, random fees I forget about until they post. A couple charges hitting earlier than usual can change how the whole week feels. I’ll think I’m fine and then suddenly I’m doing mental math again, wondering what hasn’t cleared yet.

What messes with my head is that I’m not reckless. I’m not going out every night, not ordering delivery constantly, not living some wild lifestyle. I do the normal Austin stuff. HEB runs, the occasional coffee, gas, maybe a meal out. And still, I hesitate more than I think I should, because I don’t fully trust that my balance reflects everything that’s coming.

It’s made me realize that Austin isn’t just expensive, it’s unpredictable. The costs don’t always show up cleanly or evenly. They stack. They drift. They land at weird times. And even when you can afford it, that unpredictability keeps you from ever fully relaxing.

I kept telling myself I just needed to budget better or be more disciplined, but that didn’t really solve the part that bothered me most, which was the guessing. I wanted fewer surprises, not tighter rules.

I’m still adjusting to the reality of living here. Austin feels like one of those cities where you can be “doing well” and still feel financially on edge in small, constant ways.

Curious if other people here feel this too. If you’re making what should be a solid income in Austin, do you actually feel stable day to day, or does it still feel tighter than it should?",109,1767806972.0,Austin,103,0.83,False

1q6lksw,https://i.redd.it/ozb6qho6pybg1.jpeg,Alcohol: The Oldest and One of the Most Popular Drugs in the World,"
Alcohol, specifically ethanol, holds a unique place in human history as one of the earliest intentionally produced psychoactive substances. For millennia, it has shaped cultures, rituals, economies, and social interactions across the globe. While its popularity remains undeniable today, its origins stretch back far deeper than most modern drugs.

#### The Ancient Origins of Alcohol

Evidence of fermented beverages dates back thousands of years, long before the rise of organized agriculture. One of the earliest confirmed examples comes from the Raqefet Cave in Israel, where residues found in stone mortars suggest that Natufian hunter-gatherers were brewing a beer-like drink from wheat and barley around 13,000 years ago. This discovery predates the development of farming, indicating that humans sought out alcohol even in pre-agricultural societies.

Another significant early site is Jiahu in China, where chemical analysis of pottery from 7000–6600 BCE revealed traces of a mixed fermented beverage made from rice, honey, and fruit—likely hawthorn or wild grapes. Similar independent discoveries occurred elsewhere: wine production in Georgia around 6000 BCE and beer brewing in ancient Iran between 5400 and 5000 BCE.

These findings demonstrate that alcohol emerged in multiple regions without cultural exchange, often linked to ceremonial feasting, religious rituals, or communal bonding. By the time of ancient civilizations, alcohol was deeply integrated into daily life. The Sumerians brewed beer as early as 4000 BCE, the Egyptians operated large-scale breweries, and the Babylonians even revered a goddess of wine. It served not only as a beverage but also as medicine, currency, and a staple safer than contaminated water sources.

#### The Enduring Popularity of Alcohol

Today, alcohol remains one of the most widely consumed recreational substances on Earth. Globally, between one-third and half of adults drink alcohol regularly, making it the third-most popular beverage after water and tea. In many countries, particularly in Europe, annual per capita consumption exceeds 10 liters of pure alcohol among those aged 15 and older, with some nations like Romania topping recent lists at around 17 liters.

Its widespread use is bolstered by legal status, cultural acceptance, and social traditions in most societies—factors that set it apart from illicit drugs. For comparison, cannabis, the most commonly used illegal substance, has an estimated 244 million users worldwide, a fraction of alcohol’s reach.

That said, when considering all psychoactive substances, caffeine technically claims the title of the world’s most consumed, present in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and sodas, with up to 90% of adults in some regions using it daily. Alcohol, however, stands out as the most popular *intoxicating* drug, prized for its euphoric and disinhibiting effects.

#### A Double-Edged Legacy

Despite its ancient roots and ongoing appeal, alcohol carries significant risks. It contributes to millions of deaths annually through liver disease, cancers, accidents, violence, and other alcohol-related conditions. Public health organizations highlight its role as a leading preventable cause of mortality worldwide.

In recent years, consumption patterns have begun to shift in some regions. Per capita intake has declined in parts of the West, younger generations are drinking less, and the market for non-alcoholic alternatives is growing rapidly. Yet alcohol’s deep cultural entrenchment ensures its continued prominence.

From prehistoric brews in stone mortars to modern craft distilleries, alcohol’s journey reflects humanity’s long-standing relationship with altered states of consciousness. It is a substance that has brought people together in celebration, ritual, and relaxation for over ten millennia—and, for better or worse, it shows little sign of fading from the human experience.",1,1767806788.0,news_nest,0,1.0,False

1. We exchanged pictures early on. A few days later, he told me he was “naturally smooth and hairless”. The picture he sent a few days back had a guy on a tank top and pretty long armpit hairs. (I thought.. it could happen)

2. When looking for locations, he didn’t seem to know the area. Couldn’t name a single place around where we said we lived, asked if I was far from a certain city. If he lived where he said he did he would know that. (Now I’m really questioning things)

3. He wrote me a few messages that did not sound anything like the guy I had been talking to. The grammar was bad, the words and sentences he used were different. Felt like a totally different person. 

4. He didn’t respond all day yesterday to any messages. 

I read here about the scams that people try to do in the apps, the blackmailing ones. So my antena was really going off and I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that something wasn’t right with that guy. I had given him some information about me, but not enough to find out who I was. Only my first name, age, and vaguely the job I have which is common. We only talked for 4 days or so. 

I panicked, I blocked him. Then I don’t know if it was my fear of just coming to terms with everything. I panicked more and deleted my email and my accounts on the apps. I was really worried about him being a scammer, but something didn’t feel right, I couldn’t place my finger on it. 

Did I over react? Did I just mess up something that could’ve gone somewhere? 

TL. DR: guy I was talking to for a few days felt off. Many red flags, thought it was a scam and deleted apps and email account because I had a bad feeling. Did I over react? ",1,1767806716.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1q6lj49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q6lj49/wtf_is_going_on_lmao/,wtf is going on lmao,"About a week before Christmas I bumped into a VERY old friend at an event. I haven’t seen him since I was 13 (I’m now in my 30s). It was a beautiful reunion, he was great to talk to, we talked for a while and then we exchanged numbers. I texted the next day and said it’d be nice to meet for a coffee soon. He enthusiastically said yes. Context is, I’ve moved back to my hometown after over a decade away. He moved away (I believe a couple of years ago) so he is just here for the holidays. We bumped into each other at another party a couple of days later, where he and I talked for 3 hours but only after this girl left who I later on found out he might be dating? Idek because he has not said anything about this relationship. As things would have it, I’m seeing him tomorrow and someone I know just texted telling me he’s on a date with the same girl. He hasn’t told me he’s dating her, and if he is they are long distance. About tomorrow: remember when I said the original plan was coffee? Well, yesterday he also asked if we can meet at mine tomorrow, “for a good reason”. I really don’t want any bullshit and need him to tell me what it is. I’m too grown for random games. Need advice. I don’t wanna make a huge deal out of it because ultimately nothing has happened between us, although he has been very flirty and he had his hand on my ass for a good amount of time at that party. Do I like him? Yes, I really do. He’s intriguing and smart, and I’ve admittedly not been this attracted to anyone in a while. But I’m not in the mood for mess over a halfway decent man. I’m thinking of cancelling. I need him to be honest with me, and I really need to know how to move forward from here. I also don’t want to make a mountain over a molehill and have a whole confrontation over a man I was not thinking about literally 2 weeks ago. Advice very welcome.

1q6lj0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q6lj0u/the_curse_that_my_grandfather_brought_on_our/,"The curse that my grandfather brought on our family is after me, and I think I won't want to escape it ever again","Another long, exhausting night waiting tables at the restaurant had finally come to an end. It was almost midnight, and I was heading home. The street was pretty dark, even though the streetlights buzzed softly over my head. Out of breath from the warm summer air, I walked toward the end of the street, where my grandma’s house stood, the place I’d been living in for about a year now. I moved in two years after she passed away, once I realized college and nonstop studying just weren’t for me.

“Enough running table to table. Time to sleep,” I muttered as I reached the door. Just as I slid the key into the lock, a quiet, but pretty clear sound echoed from inside.

Knock.

Knock.

Knock.

Three slow knocks. From the inside of the door.

“You’re hearing things, Steve,” I thought, even though my nerves jumped. I really needed sleep.

The next morning I woke up with a headache after barely getting five hours of restless sleep.

By afternoon, I got ready and headed to work. The restaurant greeted me with the usual chaos: customers talking over each other, servers rushing around with plates and drinks. I waved at a few coworkers, they waved back.

In the locker room I ran into Gary, a fellow server and my best friend.

“ 'Sup, Steve?” he asked, cheerful as always.

“Nothing much, man,” I said. “Ready to argue with rich Karens again?”

He smirked. “We've gotta tell the boss to put up a ‘No Karens Allowed’ sign.” He slapped his forehead. “Dude… yesterday was brutal. I have no idea how I didn’t get fired.”

“You handled it well,” I said, patting his shoulder. “Let’s survive another day.”

“Deal,” he replied, tying his apron. “Table six just sat down.”

“Showtime.”

The evening went smoothly. Customers came and went, happy with the food and service. There was a ton of work, but I barely felt tired thanks to the four cups of coffee I’d downed during the day.

When the shift ended, Gary offered to drive me home.

“Thanks for the ride, dude,” I said as I got out.

“You're,” he replied, leaning out the window. “Just me a beer tomorrow.” He laughed.

“Deal. We’re watching the game tommorrow, remember?”

Gary didn’t answer. He frowned, his eyes darting left and right.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Come here,” he whispered, motioning for me to get closer. He stared at a spot across from my house. “Someone’s standing over there.”

I looked but couldn’t see anything. “Where?”

“Behind that tree,” he said, pointing.

And then I saw it. Half of a human-shaped figure, hidden in shadow behind the tree in my neighbor's front yard. No details at all. Just a shape.

“Holy sh...” I muttered.

Gary suddenly stood up and opened the trunk. He pulled out two wrenches and tossed one to me.

“Cover me,” he said, urgency in his voice.

“Hey! Who are you?” Gary shouted as we approached. “Step into the light!”

The figure didn’t move.

“Gary, I'm not sure this is a good idea.”

Then the figure slipped completely behind the tree. We rushed around both sides,
and found nothing.

“That’s impossible,” Gary said, frustrated. “It just... vanished.”

“Seems like it,” I replied, just as confused.

A few days passed. Work stayed the same. At home, I did the things that made me happy. I went out for drinks with coworkers. Everything felt normal, like I’d never heard the knocking or seen the shadow.

I knew I wasn’t crazy. Gary had seen it too.

On my day off, I decided to spend the evening at home with delivery tacos and a good movie. Once the food arrived, I settled onto the couch and turned the TV on. Perfect night to relax.

Then I felt it.

An icy breath against the back of my neck. I jumped up.

Something was here.

Something that chilled me to the bone.

The TV image started glitching, then shut off completely.

Something was wrong.

I checked the house. No open doors. No open windows. And cold wind in the middle of a Texas summer didn’t make any sense.

On my way back to the living room, I stopped in front of my grandma’s bedroom door. I wasn’t sure I should go in. Something inside me resisted, maybe grief, maybe respect. I opened it anyway.

I flipped on the light. Everything was exactly as she’d left it three years ago: the old wooden desk, the wardrobe, the neatly made bed, personal items and dusty books on a shelf. I took a careful step toward the window, and tripped on the folded edge of the rug. I fell forward, catching myself on the shelf.

Something heavy fell to the floor with a dull thud. I knew instantly what it was.

A golden plated statue of a muscular man with the head of a dog or a wolf. Old. The gold plating chipped on many spots. Around its neck was a pearl necklace. In one hand it held a staff, sitting cross-legged on a round base, as if guarding something.

“No way she kept it after so much time…” I whispered.

It was the statue that terrified me as a kid. Whenever we visited my grandma, she always hid it so I wouldn’t see it, though she clearly adored it. I never understood why.

I put the statue back and left the room.
The next day after my morning shift, Gary and I sat at a bar for some cold and refreshing beer, the Texas sun blazing outside.

“By the way,” Gary said, “have you seen that guy again? The one hiding?”

“Nope,” I said. “Hasn’t shown up since.”

“Any idea who could that be?”

“No clue. Probably some teenager sneaking out of his girlfriend's window.”

“Maybe,” Gary laughed.

I looked at him, and something felt off. His face seemed to change shape, and his skin painted like a stone.

“Just be careful,” he said, his voice suddenly deeper, doubled. “If something happens, run.”

I froze.

Then Gary blinked. “I mean, if it was just some teen, a fellow dad would’ve chased him, right?” He was himself again.

“Oh,” I said, pretending to catch on late. “Yeah… right.”

“You okay, man?” he asked. “You seem distant.”

“I’m fine. Just tired.”

But I knew it wasn’t just tiredness.

It was night and I had just left the restaurant to go home. It was pretty warm night. As soon as I made it to the next block I saw the silhouette standing in the passage between two buildings. Human body, and the head a bit too wide, but still unclear to make out the contours. I focused my glance, and it glitched out, like a distorted TV signal.

A few blocks later, I saw it again standing by a power pole. And again, human body with an unclear and big head. It seemed as if it watched me from distance, but I couldn't make out any details to be sure. It just stood still.

I got home, locked the front door, and stepped into the shower. It was refreshing after a long, exhausting afternoon. I wanted peace and nothing else…

Knock.

Knock.

Knock.

Three slow knocks on the bathroom door. The sense of refreshment instantly turned into a fight-or-flight situation.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a bathrobe, grabbed the metal shoehorn, and started looking around. Whatever it was, it had to be close. The hallway light began to flicker, then the bulb burst. I flinched at the sound. The TV in the living room turned on by itself, then shut off. Suddenly, all the lights in the house started flickering.

“Welcome to the Upside Down,” I joked nervously.

Then I noticed a silhouette sprint past behind me, heading toward the stairs to the upper floor, toward my bedroom. I went upstairs and saw the thing standing in the middle of the hallway. A tall, dark silhouette shaped like a human.

“What are you?” I asked. “What do you want from me?” I was just as terrified as I was desperate for answers.

The figure stood there, completely motionless. It was as if it were staring straight at me. But now I could see its head. It was a wolf’s or dog's head, wide and furry, with pointed ears and a snout, and piercing emerald green eyes. The other details became clearer too. Its body was male and muscular, and it wore a pearl necklace around its neck, just like my grandmother’s statue. There was also a staff strapped to its back.

I stood frozen, unable to step closer or run away. A cold wind raged through the room, and I was shaking, both from the cold and from fear. I had no idea what was happening.

Then I heard a whisper. “Be careful… When it happens, run.”

As soon as it ended, the wind intensified like a storm, and then silence. Everything went still, and the figure was gone. All that remained was the open door to my room, and the open window.

What did that thing mean?

I immediately went to my grandmother’s room and began digging through her belongings. I found my grandfather’s old journal; he had died many years before I was born. After a long time flipping through pages and reading, I finally found how he had obtained the statue: he had found it washed up on a beach near the bay where he often went fishing. Much later, armed thieves broke into their home, this very house. The statue came to life and chased the thieves away, but not before appearing as a shadow for a week beforehand. Later, when they were in a car accident, the same statue pulled them out of the crushed vehicle. After speaking to a clairvoyant, they were told that the statue had a bound spirit that would protect them from evil as long as they kept it, and that it would remain a loyal guardian for as long as the family bloodline endured.

Now I understood that the thing I had seen was actually trying to protect me from something dangerous that was yet to come.

The next evening, I was working at the restaurant. The same noise as always: guests talking, cutlery clinking, soft and pleasant music. Everything seemed normal, even though I knew something was going to happen.

I noticed a man in a suit sitting alone at a table. He kept putting his phone to his ear and looking around.

“Keep an eye on him,” I whispered to Gary when I ran into him in the dining area.

“Why, Steve?” Gary asked, confused. “You’re freaking me out.”

“Just watch him,” I replied shortly and headed to the kitchen to pick up food orders.

As soon as I entered the kitchen, the young assistant cook, Enrique, came running and crashed into me.

“Watch it, kid,” I said.

“Sorry, Steve,” Enrique replied cheerfully and ran off. He was clearly in a hurry.

Everything in the dining area seemed normal. The man in the suit was gone. I found Gary.

“Where the hell did he go?” I asked.

“He left. I charged him for the food and he left a big tip.”

“Okay,” I said, nodding.

“By the way, what’s up with Enrique?” Gary asked.

“No idea. He just ran out of the kitchen.”

“I think he went outside and still hasn’t come back.”

“Excuse me,” an elderly woman called out. “It’s kind of cold in here. Could you turn off the air conditioning?”

“Yes, right away, ma’am,” Gary replied. Then he turned to me, confused. “Did you by any chance turn the AC on?”

“Nah, it’s been off for an hour,” I said. I shuddered as a cold wave wrapped around me too. The thing was here.

“Did you feel that?” Gary asked, rubbing his shoulders.

“Yes. Just keep an eye out for anything unusual.”

“What do you mean?” Gary looked confused.

“Long story. I’ll explain later.”

I kept working, serving the guests. New faces came and went, and I searched for the culprit among them. Paranoia had taken hold of me.

I noticed Enrique returning to the kitchen.
Suddenly, the power went out, and total darkness fell over the restaurant. Panicked screams echoed from the guests.

“Please stay calm,” Gary called out, trying to settle everyone down. “A minor power outage. It’ll be fixed soon.”

I headed toward the storage room next to the kitchen. I ran into Enrique as he was coming out. He had most likely shut off the power.

“What did you do?!” I grabbed him by the collar, furious.

“Run,” he said. “If you want to live, run.” Then he broke free from my grip and fled.

I found the power switch. It was damaged, which meant I couldn’t turn it back on.

Through the back door, I saw two people quietly and cautiously enter. I grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed them in the face. One of them managed to knock it out of my hands and was about to hit me over the head.

“Watch out, freight train coming!” Gary shouted, pushing a cart full of dishes and slamming the two intruders into the storage room. I got up and locked them inside.

“You okay, man?” Gary asked.

“Great. You?”

We headed back into the dining area, where Enrique had pulled out a gun and was firing into the ceiling. “Give me all the money!” he shouted at the guests.

There was a loud crash from the kitchen, and the two intruders came out, guns in hand, taking hostages.

Suddenly, a cold wind swept through the room, and a dark silhouette began racing around. First it took down Enrique, then it went after the other two, who dropped the hostages.

“This is it,” I said to Gary. “The shadow we saw. It’s visited me many times. It’ll protect all of us.”

“Cool,” Gary said, too stunned to ask any question.

The two intruders fired around wildly, but it was useless, they couldn’t shoot the silhouette.

Then the silhouette began dragging them, along with Enrique across tge floor, and toward the front entrance, just as the police arrived.

The police too care of the assistant cook amd his two friends as the silhouette appeared across the street, just watching. It pulled its staff out and sat on the sidewalk, proudly. The job was done.

The next morning, Gary and I met in the park near the restaurant, plastic cups of hot coffee im hand.

Gary wasn’t joking anymore. He wanted answers. “You’re gomna tell me I didn’t imagine what happened last night, right?”

I told him everything. About my grandmother and grandfather, about the room I never wanted to open, about the statue, about the silhouette that had followed me long before it saved our lives. It wasn’t there to haunt me, it was there to protect me. To protect me as my grandfather's descendant.

Gary listened without interrupting. When I finished, he said, “Good thing it’s on our side."" He held his coffe cup up. ""Cheers in that name.""

And yes, we clinked with coffee.

""Still can't believe my family had an otherworldly guardian all these years.""

""Sounds nuts, but true. I'm glad it's handy.""

That same day, as soon as I got home, I took the statue down from its dusty shelf. I cleaned it and placed it in the living room, in a spot worthy of it: up on the commode, as if on it's own pedestal, to watch over in good and bad, utterly silent.

Until it manifests again through shadows.

Since I had already requested my tubes removed, we decided to go straight to CKC while already under anesthesia for that.

My procedure was last Tuesday. I arrived at the hospital at 1pm and my procedure should have started at 3pm, but was bumped to almost 5pm due to an emergency surgery. NBD, it happens, I just tried to nap until my surgery time. 

Waking up from anesthesia was honestly pretty smooth. To go home I had to show them I could eat, drink, and pee normally and I was ready to get the heck out of there 😂 so they got me a drink and a snack right away. I spent the rest of the night sleeping. The hardest thing was actually just not being allowed to eat or drink from midnight the night before until after surgery which finished around 6pm according to my DH. We got home around 8pm.

I don't think I had any pain from the CKC until day 3. Most of my immediate pain was from the incisions for my tube removal, and even that was pretty minor. On day 3 I had some cramping, but no worse than a period. I did sleep A LOT during recovery. The 1-2 day recommended recovery time was not enough for me, I didn't feel remotely human until day 6, but please remember I also had the tube removal, not just the CKC. 

I've had very minimal bleeding, which is crazy because I also had my period going in to the CKC. The discharge is definitely weird, and I had some (TMI) coffee ground like discharge as well as what looked like strips or sheets of yellowish-brown stuff. All normal apparently. I'm using just a small panty liner type pad and it's been enough.

AS FOR THE RESULTS 
HSIL (CIN 3) extending to endocervical gland. Definitive margins could not be identified. 

My cervical sample apparently also included multiple small benign cysts and a polyp (also benign). I had a cyst on my fallopian tube as  as a cyst on my right uterosacral ligament. Those are usually from endometriosis, which I was not aware that I had.

So it sounds like I'm in for a second surgery? I'm already scheduled for a follow up pap smear in 6 months and I do plan to get the HPV vaccine in the meantime. Waiting to hear details from my doctor but feeling pretty discouraged at this point.

1q6lhqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1q6lhqt/my_blurb_needs_work/,My Blurb needs work.,"Hi folks.

My book is basically a cozy sitcom following a touring band and happens to be in space. The plots revolve around a rock band getting their first taste of life outside of the backwater station they grew up on, their career, and life in general.

Here is the current blurb I'm using and there's a lot to not like about it. I feel like it might be setting incorrect expectations for the book itself, leaning too hard on the setting instead of the characters.

>Jax Hammet has hit rock bottom. His ship, the *Dust Devil,* is broken, his family’s disappointed, and he’s stuck bartending on a backwater orbital station, watching his savings bleed away to dock fees. He’s got one week before everything he’s worked for disappears for good.  
  
Negative Space has the talent to shake the quadrant, but they’re trapped playing to empty rooms on Tuesday nights, grinding toward the soul-crushing acceptance that dreams don’t pay the rent. They’re one gig away from giving up.  
  
A desperate gamble brings them together: Jax’s courier ship for the band’s skills and cash. Fix the ship, hit the road, chase the music. Simple.  
  
Except nothing in space is ever simple.  
  
From grimy station dives to the glittering spires of the quadrant's elite, Negative Space tears across known space, leaving sold-out shows and baffled authorities in their wake. But the cargo they’re hauling isn’t as innocent as it seems, and the faster they fly, the closer danger gets to catching up.  
  
*Velocity* is a high-octane space opera about misfits, music, and the raw power of forward motion. When you’ve got nothing left to lose, sometimes the only choice is to punch the throttle and see how fast you can go.

Here is a second take leans harder on the characters, perhaps too much. I don't know.

>The Galaxy is Waiting. They’re Ready to Get Loud.

>Jax Hammet is grounded on a backwater station, watching his savings dissolve into dock fees for a broken ship he loves too much to leave behind. He has a flight suit, a saxophone hidden under his bunk, and a desperate need for open sky.

>Negative Space has a sound that shakes the floorboards, but they’re trapped playing to empty rooms on Tuesday nights. They have the talent, the drive, and a bassist with hair the color of a supernova—they just lack the velocity to escape gravity.

>A handshake over a sticky bar seals the deal: Jax trades his ship for the band’s welding skills and cash. The plan is simple: fix the engine, hit the road, and chase the music.

>What follows is a tour through the lived-in corners of the Milky Way. Aboard the Dust Devil, a ship that smells of hydraulic fluid, stale coffee, and warm amplifiers, a tight-knit band and a lonely pilot must learn to become a crew. From the neon-soaked markets of the Fringe to the crystal spires of high society, they navigate shady promoters and government agents with nothing but their wits, their instruments, and a well-tuned drive.

>Velocity is an adventure defined by the hum of the engine, the heat of a soldering iron, and the terrifying, beautiful realization that the most important part of the journey is the people sitting across the galley table.

>Pack your bags. The tour starts now.

1q6lh8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/surrendered_wife/comments/1q6lh8g/good_but_not_great_rant/,Good but not great rant,"I feel like I’ve PROBABLY saved my marriage from instant divorce. A lot of things have changed. H wanted to be sep last Nov when everything blew up, then started saying he wanted a divorce by the time summer rolled around. There was an OW of sorts that has disappeared. Suddenly in late July/early August I had just accepted there was nothing I could do to change his mind about divorce. I started accepting that if he really wants to leave me he can & will, & that all I can do is continue on with the skills (had been practicing for 8 months at this point) & be the best version of myself. I got in the mindset that if he left me it was going to be the best version of me he’d be leaving. 

We were away with ext family mid August & I felt like he didn’t want me there but I decided to just have the time of my life. I laughed & was playful & just enjoyed myself. I felt him softening towards me slowly over the weekend & then one of the days he just got playful with me, tossing me into the water & just laughed & went along with it. I think that was the tipping point for him bc normally I would be uptight about being dunked & I think it helped him realize I can be fun. He laughed with me & kissed me & then in the following days I noticed him change what he was saying & how he was acting a bit. It would be when “we” move, when “we” sell the house, when “we” go away. he started telling me about plans again, & actively seeking out time with me in little ways like asking if I want to meet for coffee on my work break. I took all the openings & always say yes to anything that isn’t going to be an I can’t or make me resentful. Suddenly there were more texts, touches & he started sleeping in our bedroom again. 

Basically things are back to a comfortable place where I feel like he isn’t going to leave me but I don’t feel like he’s happy still. I know that’s not on my paper, I do, but I can’t help but wonder if things will get to a place where they are great? He hasn’t said I love you & I haven’t been saying it either because I don’t want to push or smother. I definitely have eased back on the skills a bit bc they are somewhat second nature now but I know there are some things I can be more intentional about like more gratitudes, upgraded self care & more fun. We have a solid amount of PI now but I still feel like a lot of it is somewhat initiated by me. 

Last night a had a little slip up & got frustrated with the kids & him & was kinda snappy. I said that he makes bedtime more difficult bc he doesn’t reinforce the boundaries I’m setting with the kids & he was somewhat laughing but I think I pissed him off. By the time kids were asleep he was too so I sent a text today to say sorry & he hasn’t responded. We’ve had a couple difficult weeks (taken out by flu A, then as we were getting better D had appendicitis & we spent a week in a hospital, now I have my period). I’m probably making this a bigger deal than it needs to be but it just has me thinking I want things to be GREAT, not just good or ok. 

Finding myself anxious at work today wondering how things will be with him when I get home. Haven’t worried or felt like this in a while. Tell me what to do! Start a journal again? Self care? Gratitudes? Was in a private coaching group for a while & I miss it so much but it’s not in the finance cards right now especially after a 1 week stay in the hospital with surgery etc for my D. Help me refocus please :)

*edited to add*- H answered my text now. He said all is good, that he doesn’t try to deliberately sabotage bedtime & that he could prob do more to help but also he doesn’t want to undermine me by just telling them what to do bc they listen better to him bc that doesn’t help me either. I appreciated him saying that & said IHY & agree I need to find what works for me with them in this phase AND  he asked if I can come meet for a coffee or lunch on our breaks. Still would love the insight on what I asked above so I can stay on track. ",2,1767806574.0,surrendered_wife,0,1.0,False

Jacob McCowsky, Founder of Rooms for Refugees

Date [Standardized Human Time]: October 6, 2142

“Are you sure I shouldn’t be wearing a suit?” I asked while I looked myself over in the mirror.

“Dad, it’s a blind date. I’m pretty sure you’re already overdressed for it,” Bud assured me from his spot sitting on my bed. 

“Do people not wear dress shirts for these kinda things anymore?”

“Not according to my research, no.” He replied, looking up from his pad at me.

“Ugh, okay.” I held my chin in my hand, staring at my scraggly face. “Should I, like, do something with my beard at least?” 

Bud raised his brow at me. “You? Shave?”

“No, not shave, but just like...a trim, ya know? Maybe look less like I wandered out of the mountains.”

“I think that might count as false advertising,” he teased.

“Jerk,” I laughed. “You spend too much time with Telif. He’s making you sassy.”

“Uh huh, sure, and who made *him* sassy?”

“Irrelevant.” 

Bud rolled his eyes at me. “Why are you stressing so much anyway? You said you’re only doing this because Aysef begged you and that you’re not really interested in dating anyone.”

“I know, but Aysef was so excited he found someone for me. I want to at least pretend like I’m open to it, ya know?”

“Why not try being *actually* open to it?”

“Don’t *need* any more family.” I shrugged. “I already got like ten lizards and a handful of Venlil. What more could I need?”

“You really don’t want a partner?”

“Eh, I’m indifferent. If I met someone by chance, I might go for it, but blind dates and shit always felt so awkward and forced, ya know?”

“Not really. I’ve never been on a date.”

“Wanna take my spot?”

“No.”

“Dang.”

I spent the next few minutes styling my hair and picking out a tie, while my son oh-so-usefully told me they all looked fine and I was overthinking things again. I found myself wishing Tel and Siv were here. The two had no fashion sense at all, but they at least would be honest if something looked terrible, unlike Bud, who was too nice for his own good.

“Why’d those stupid jerk faces have to be out of town for a medical conference?” I grumbled to myself. “Hell, even Aysef and his weird fashion obsession woulda been nice to have around, but that rat bastard set me up on a date, then fled the state with my two best friends.”

My car pulled up to the restaurant Aysef had chosen. Some snooty place where I’d likely have to pretend I cared about wine pairings while ordering. I pulled out my pad to check the time and make sure I wasn’t running late when I saw a message from Telif. 

<AnxietyScales> [Hey Jacob. It’s late here but I wanted to wish you good luck on your date. Sivik would say it as well but he passed out almost as soon as we returned to our room. I think Aysef is still being a social butterfly downstairs, so he might forget to say good luck as well. I swear, he makes me look like an introvert. Anyway, message us when you’re home. Love you.]

<JakeyBoy> [Thanks man. I’ll let you guys know. Love ya too. Even that jerk ass Aysef who made me do this.]

*No response. He must have sent the message and then passed out. Typical. Well, no use delaying anymore. Time to go see what Aysef thinks my taste in women is. If he even picked a woman, that is.*

I wandered in and gave the maitre d' my reservation details. He brought me to the back of the room, where I set up the bouquet of roses I was supposed to use to help my mystery date locate me and ordered my first drink of the night. I hoped they wouldn’t take too long to arrive, as I was finding myself more and more anxious by the minute, and didn’t want to end up wasted before they arrived.

“Hello,” an obviously alien voice called out a few minutes after I had finished my first drink. “Are you Aysef’s friend?”

I looked around for a second before my eyes shot down, and I noticed an alien species I’d never even heard of before, but that looked kind of like a green guinea pig with horns, staring up at me.

“Oh, yes, hi!” I stood up, remembering my manners. “My name’s Jacob. It’s nice to meet you…”

“Panya,” she pulled herself to her hind legs and offered me her paw, “nice to meet you as well.”

Quickly remembering my manners, I pulled her seat out for her before returning to my own. I wasn’t sure if I was just imagining it, but it looked like she was staring at my hands with what I read as disappointment in her eyes.

“I apologize,” I started, “and I hope this doesn’t come off as rude, but I’m still not familiar with all the species-”

“Don’t apologize,” she said quickly, but the tone didn’t match her words. She sounded…disappointed?  “I’m sure it’s hard to learn all of the prey available. I’m an Angren.”

*Did… did she just call herself prey? Isn’t that weird? I haven’t been around many “normal” herbivores… well, ever, but that feels really damned weird!*

“Thanks for understanding.” I decided not to address it. “You seem pretty comfortable around humans. Have you been on Earth long?”

“First time, actually,” she replied slyly, which only added to my confusion. “In fact, this is the first time I’ve been around predators.”

“Oh, well, uh, humans are a good starting one, I guess.” I laughed uncomfortably. 

“Mmmm, I bet you are.” She licked her lips.

*Is she staring at my teeth? Am I in danger?*

“So um, how did you meet Aysef?” I asked, eager to change the topic as fast as I could.

“Oh, we met on one of those forums designed to get prey used to predators.” She's doing it again. “I was so excited when I found out he was an Arxur, but sadly he doesn’t seem interested in…romance, so I asked if he knew anyone who was, and he set this whole thing up.”

“Oh, you’re interested in meeting Arxur? That’s rare for herbivores.”

I thought, for the briefest of moments, about bringing up Bud or Telif to her, but some deeper instinct told me that was a horrendous idea, so I refrained. 

“Oh, I’ve been interested in them ever since I was a teen and I saw them during my first PD screening.” Her voice had that sly tone that put my bones into attack mode again. “Sadly I grew up on Wesk, so I never got to experience a raid.”

*Ooooookay, she’s insane. Survival tasks. Get through the date, but don’t let her see your license plate. She doesn’t know your last name, so hopefully she can’t find you on the internet later. Make sure to tell Aysef she’s a crazy person and to block her, and also to never ever set you up on a date again.*

“That’s a shame,” I said with as much fake sympathy as I could muster as I stealthily signaled for our waiter. “Oh hey, our waiter is here. Do you know what you want, or do you wanna start with some alcohol?”

“Humans can drink alcohol?”

“Yep, we are omnivores after all!” Disappointment spread over her face.

“Hmm, thought for sure that was a lie to get us to trust you…”

*Oh, Jesus Christ.*

“Nope, we love plants. In fact, I think I’ll have a salad for dinner.” I turned to the waiter. “What vegan ones do you have?”

“Vegan? What’s that?” she asked before he could reply.

“Things made without any animal products. I actually don’t eat any meat,.” I lied.

“Oh, um, will you excuse me for a minute? I need to use the restroom.” 

I waited till she was out of earshot before speaking again.

“Dude, my date is insane. When you bring us the check, please, for the love of god, don’t let her see my full name.”

“Do you need me to call the cops?” he whispered back.

“I don’t think we need to go that far yet, but I’ll order some coffee if that changes.”

“Got it.” He gave me a thumbs up.

I sat in awkward silence for a few minutes, wondering what was taking her so long, when suddenly I felt my pad vibrate in my pocket. I decided to ignore proper dinner etiquette and see who was messaging me. I was a bit surprised to see Aysef’s name. 

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Hey, is everything okay on your date? I just got a flood of messages and an angry voicemail from Panya.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Oh I just got another one.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Oh, that is not very nice at all. I don’t think I’ll share it.]

<JakeyBoy> [Dude, she’s fucking nuts. She told me she was sad that the Arxur never raided her planet.]

<JakeyBoy> [What could have possibly made you think we were a good match?]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [She seemed really excited to meet a predator, and was saying how attractive she thought they were.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Said she loves our teeth and claws.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [And that she’s been looking for a big strong predator to treat her like she deserves.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [You’re one of the strongest people I know and you’re single so I thought it might be a good match.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Plus you’re one of the most generous people I’ve met, and it sounded like she needed someone as caring as you.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Was I wrong?]

*Remain calm, Jakey. He had good intentions. Deep breath before you reply.*

<JakeyBoy> [I think she wanted something different than you think she did.]

<JakeyBoy> [Something far more violent.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Why would someone want violence from a partner?]

*Nope. I’ve had to explain sex to way more aliens than any one man should. Someone else can take this one.*

<JakeyBoy> [I’m gonna be real blunt with you.]

<JakeyBoy> [This is not a conversation I even slightly want to have with you.]

<JakeyBoy> [Ask Jesse.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Okay…]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [It seems I have upset you.]

*Holy shit, he isn’t completely hopeless.*

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [I am very sorry. I truly thought you would like her.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [I’ll pay you back for this dinner…]

*Goddammit, now I feel bad.* 

<JakeyBoy> [It’s okay. I only got one drink before she snuck off.]

<JakeyBoy> [Just like, please don’t try and set me up with anyone else.]

<JakeyBoy> [Or at least let Jesse check for red-flags before you do.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Red-flags?]

<JakeyBoy> [I’ll explain it later.]

<JakeyBoy> [For now maybe just block Panya and get some sleep, yeah?]

<JakeyBoy> [Actually scratch that, definitely block her.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [I will. Sorry again.]

<HowIsAysefAlreadyInUse?> [Good night]

<JakeyBoy> [Night.]

I shoved my pad back in my pocket and flagged the waiter over to pay for my drink before slinking out of the restaurant in shame.

*Well, there goes the rest of my night. We were supposed to go see a movie as well. Should I just go home? Nah, I don’t want Bud to know his dad’s a loser who got ditched by a guinea pig who wanted to be eaten. That’s too shameful, even for me. Fuck it. I’m gonna go drink and get some food at Mal’s. That way I can at least pretend I made it through the first part.*

Mal’s was about a kilometer away, but I was in no rush, so I decided to take in the evening and walk. Knowing I needed to stagger all the way back if I got drunk would hopefully keep me from having too much. I pushed open the door and was immediately greeted from the bar.

“Hey Jake! Where’s the rest of your crew?”

“Hey Mal, just me tonight.” I replied as I climbed into a seat at the bar.

“You doin’ alright? You look down.”

“That obvious?” I forced a laugh. “I just got ditched on a date by a woman who was absolutely nuts, which actually makes it feel worse somehow.”

“Sorry to hear that, man. At least you found out now before investing too much time.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Now, let me start you with a drink. First ones on me.”

“Thanks, Mal.” I smiled back. “Gimme a rum and coke.”

~*~

“And it’s like. I’m fine bein’ single, ya know? But like, how fucked up is it that the freaky alien that wanted me to vore her thought I was too much of a loser to even go on one full date?” I slurred before slamming back another rum and coke.

“I don’t think that had anything to do with you, Jake,” Mal replied. “I think anyone other than a Dominion Arxur woulda been a disappointment for her.”

“I know.” I signaled for him to pour me another glass. “But like, I’ve never had a relationship last very long. At some point it makes you wonder, am I the problem?”

“I find it hard to believe you’re the problem. I’ve seen how much your family adores you.” He took my glass. “Sure you wanna keep drinking your sadness away?”

“I ‘unno man.”

“How ‘bout we get some food in you, then see if you still want to drink?”

“Yeah, sure. Just gimme whatever. All your food is amazing.” I pouted as I rested my head on the counter.

I was idly playing with my straw wrapper when a large shadow appeared behind me.

“Is this seat taken?” The unmistakable hiss of an Arxur.

“Be my guest,” I replied, not even bothering to turn towards her.

“You alright?” she asked as she climbed onto the stool beside me. “I haven’t known many humans, but you seem upset.”

“I’ll be fine. Just wallowing in self-pity.”

“And why’s that?”

“Sad, lonely. Wondering if I’ll ever be good enough for someone…”

“What makes you think you aren’t?” I could practically sense the patented Arxur head tilt.

“Cuz I’m nearly thirty and still alone,” I grumbled.

“Hmm, is that considered late for humans to find a mate?”

“I dunno, but it feels like it when everyone I went to high school with is married and having kids and shit.”

“Well, I think I’m about twenty-five, and I don’t have a mate either.”

“Yeah, but like, your species didn’t have a concept of dating till, like, five years ago.”

“That is true, but still, you seem like a nice enough person. I’m sure you’ll find someone.”

“Yeah, sure, thanks…”

I finally decided to lift my head to look at her. She was on the smaller side of Arxur I’d seen, and was nearly as heavily scarred as Telif, but she had softer, purple-ish eyes.

“You’re welcome,” she replied, smiling like Telif did when he was still figuring it out.

“I’m Jacob, by the way.” I finally thought to introduce myself.

“Zeyth,” she replied. “And um, this is awkward, but I actually knew your name already.”

“You did?” I blinked in confusion. Wondering if I had a name tag on that I’d forgotten about.

“Um, yes, I recognized you from when you were advocating for Arxur refugees and from your charity, Rooms for Refugees.. You’re actually kinda famous in some circles,” she said with a nervous laugh.

“Oh, that makes sense, I think. Feels weird to think anyone knows about me, though.”

“I can imagine,” she replied with that cute nervous laugh again. “Um, actually, I had a bit of an ulterior motive for approaching you…”

“You did?” I was confused again. What would anyone want from me?

“Um, yes, it’s about the Arxur you were always with on TV.”

“Telif?”

“Yeah, him.” I could see a bit of red appear in her scars. “I’ve, um, been looking for him.”

“What for?”

“It’s silly, but we used to fight together in the Dominion. He was always kind to me…”

I could see she was fighting back tears and instinctively reached out to grab her paw without thinking she might find it odd. Luckily she didn’t seem offended and squeezed it back.

“Thanks,” she sniffled, “but it’s more than just that. I-I thought he was dead for a long time. His name appeared in the list of casualties after the attack on Earth…”

*Oh fuck, I forgot he faked his own death…*

“I can assure you he’s very much alive!” I replied a bit too quickly.

“I know.” She gave me that awkward smile again. “I recognized him when I was browsing human news. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw him. Not only was he alive, but he looked so happy. I’d never seen him like that before… I requested an audience with his Victoriousness, Isif, immediately-”

*That’s a dumb title.*

“-Since he was the one who had reported his death, and he confirmed that he’d helped him fake his own death so he could flee the Dominion. I can’t even begin to tell you how happy I was to hear that. I wanted to come and see him, but the quarantine didn’t make it easy.”

I could feel my brain processing what she said.

“Wait, you came here from Wriss? How?”

“It took a few years, but the Yotul opened an embassy on Wriss,” she replied nervously, like she was afraid I might report her, but I gave her a reassuring look, and she continued, “and I, um, pleaded with their ambassador to get a message to Telif but they said they could do me one better and smuggled me to Leirn then here…”

“Yeah, that tracks with the Yotul I’ve met. Telling them not to do something only encourages them.""

“They’re quite rebellious, aren’t they?”

“That’s one way to put it.”

“Anyway, um, do you think I could speak to him?”

“Oh yeah, of course. I’m sure he’d love to see you again,” I answered with a smile. “Fuck, I’d take you to see him right now, but he’s out of town for a conference.”

“Oh…” Her tail drooped.

“Hey, don’t look so down. He’ll be back tomorrow.”

“He will?”

“Yeah, gimme your info, and I can let you know when he’s back so you can come over.”

“I’d like that.” She wagged gently.

“Perfect, you got somewhere to stay tonight?”

“Um, the Yotul said I could stay at the embassy for a night or two if I needed to.”

“You wanna stay over at my place? I got a guest room.”

“Are you sure that’d be okay?”

“Yeah, let me just check with my son first. He can be a little nervous around new Arxur, but you being a lady should make it a bit easier.”

“You have a son?”

“Yeah, here, lemme show ya.” I pulled out my datapad and showed her my lockscreen picture of Bud and me at Pyke’s Peak. “I know the resemblance is uncanny, but he’s actually adopted.”

“Oh, that’s your kid? I remember seeing him once or twice in the news articles, but it never mentioned you’d adopted him. I think that’s wonderful.”

“Yeah, he’s not much for the spotlight, so he tried to stay in the back as much as possible. He only really travelled with us to be with me. He’s a good kid. Actually, he’s what inspired me to start Rooms for Refugees. I wanted to help more people like him.”

“I think that’s wonderful.” She grasped my hand as she replied.

“Oh, um, thanks.” I felt my face flush. “But yeah, um, lemme check with him.”

I sent Bud a quick message, explaining that I’d met an old friend of Telif’s and asking if she could stay the night.

<BasicallyBud> [Your date ended up being an Arxur Telif knew in the dominion?]

<JakeyBoy> [Oh right, forgot about that part of the night.]

<JakeyBoy> [No, my “date” was making me feel uncomfortable and I was planning to slink out when she did it for me.]

<JakeyBoy> [Ended up swinging by Mal’s for a better meal, and ran into Zeyth. She’s hoping to say hi to Telif and I figured it would be easier if she crashed in the guest room, but wanted to make sure you were okay with it.]

I watched the dots appear and disappear for a few minutes before he replied.

<BasicallyBud> [Yeah, I think I can handle it. Veltep is awake and we’re gonna video chat while you drive home so he can give me some advice.]

I smiled to myself, happy that my son had a good influence in his life other than mine. Even if I was a little concerned what that playboy's advice would be on handling an Arxur woman…

“He said it’s okay, so we’re all set. Lemme pay my tab, and we can duck out.” I suddenly remembered how far away I was parked. “Oh, are you good with a bit of a walk? I’m parked about a kilometer away.”

“Yeah, I think I can handle that. I haven’t gotten that out of shape since my days as a soldier.”

“Perfect, then you can carry me if my legs get tired,” I joked.

“I’d be okay with that,” her tail thrashed as she replied.

~*~

It wasn’t ungodly cold out, but my car’s heater had picked the perfect time to shit out, so I was eager to get back into my house.

“Welcome to my humble abode,” I stated with a yawn as I let Zeyth inside. “The guest room is downstairs, but let me check in on Bud before I show you to it.” 

“Take your time,” she replied with a wag as she beelined for the photos of Telif on the mantle. I saw her eyes watering up almost immediately as I went up the stairs.

“Hey Bud,” I called out as I knocked on his door, “mind if I come in?”

“Of course,” he sounded a little nervous, but not nearly as bad as I expected.

“Hey kiddo.” I hopped up next to him on his bed. “Zeyth is downstairs. You up to meeting her, or wanna wait till Tel and Siv are back?”

“No, I can meet her now. Veltep helped calm me down, and I’d feel rude not saying hi.”

“I’m proud of you.” I patted his shoulder, earning a wag. “Need any help up?”

“Nah, I’m not sore today.” He smiled as he hoisted himself up. “The new meds Aysef has me on have been doing wonders.”

“You been keeping up with your stretches?”

“Yes, Dad,” he replied with an eye roll.

“Just makin’ sure. I know I was terrible at keeping up with my PT when I hurt my leg in high school.”

“Yeah, but I’m actually responsible,” he teased.

“True, you’re much better behaved than I was at your age. Your dad must be raising you right.”

“He does his best.” He wrapped me in a hug, which I quickly returned. “Sorry your date didn’t go well.”

“Ah, it’s fine. She wasn’t my type anyway.”

The two of us walked downstairs. Bud hanging slightly behind me as if I could even block part of him from view. Zeyth had moved on from the mantle and was waiting for us on the couch.

“Hello, you must be Bud. Jacob’s told me so much about you,” she greeted him warmly. “Is it okay if I stand up?”

“Oh, um, yeah. Go ahead,” he replied nervously. “I’m sorry, I don’t know much about you…”

“No need to apologize. I’m sure Telif doesn’t like talking about his life before he came to Earth very much, but the two of us were the closest things to friends you could be in the Dominion.”

“Uh yeah, he, um, only really talks about that with Sivik.” Bud fidgeted. “But you seem nice. I’m sure he remembers you.”

“Thank you,” she wagged. “You don’t know how much that means to hear.”

There was a slight pause, and I noticed Bud was scratching at his scars, so I decided to check in on him.

“You doin okay, kiddo?” I whispered to him, even though I knew Zeyth could probably still hear me.

“Y-yeah, sorry. I just wasn’t expecting to meet someone new tonight.”

“It’s okay, you wanna head back to your room? I’m sure Zeyth won’t mind.”

“Um, yeah, if that’s okay.”

I wrapped my arms around him. “You did great. Get some sleep.”

“Thanks, love you, Dad.” He lifted his head to look at Zeyth. “It was nice meeting you. Sorry I couldn’t stay long.”

“It’s quite alright,” she replied softly. “It was nice meeting you as well. I hope we can talk more in the morning.”

Bud began retreating to his room. I watched as Zeyth waited till he was out of sight to speak again.

“Wonderful kid you’ve got there. Almost as handsome as his dad.”

I felt the blood rush to my face as I replied. “Oh, um, thanks. He means the world to me, so I’m glad you like him.”

“Oh? Does my opinion matter to you that much?” she asked with a mischievous tail flick.

*Oh god. Am I being flirted with?*

“I, um, yeah, anyway, it’s getting late, so why don’t I show you to your room?” I managed to stammer out a bit too fast.

“Lead the way,” her tail thrashed again.

I opened the door to the basement, leading her to the door opposite the small apartment Telif and Sivik lived in.

“Here ya go, there’s a bathroom down the hall. Door directly across from you is Tel’s place, so um, not that one. Um, need anything to sleep?”

“It’s a little chilly down here…”

“Oh, I can get you a blanket or, like, a space heater.”

“Hmm, both sound nice, but I had a better idea in mind.”

“Oh um, what’s—” She grabbed my hand and dragged me towards the bed. “Oh. I, um, okay.”

“Listen, we can take this slow, but I feel something here. Do you?” she asked as she pulled me closer.

“I-um-I do.” I managed not to squeak. “I just-it’s been a long time since.”

“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. It’s just been years since I slept in someone’s arms. You wouldn’t deny me that, would you?”

“No, of course not.” I somehow got a bit of confidence back. “Yeah, I’ll be your space heater.”

~*~

I woke up groggily the next morning, my arms still wrapped around Zeyth as she slept soundly. Despite how flirtatious she’d been, she passed almost instantly as soon as we crawled into bed. Not that I was going to complain. Her faint sniffling in her sleep told me she’d needed some contact more than she let on. I was content to sleep in a bit longer, but the sound of the garage door closing reminded me what had woken me up in the first place.

*Telif’s back!*

I could barely contain my excitement as I squirmed out of bed as quietly as I could. Not only were my two best friends back, but I had a wonderful surprise for one of them. The two had just stepped inside as I closed the basement door.

“Jacob? What are you doing out of bed before noon on a weekend?” Telif asked.

“And why were you downstairs? Something break?” Sivik added.

“Nah, nothing like that, but I heard the door and wanted to come see you two!” I ran over and pulled them both into a hug. “I missed you guys.”

“It’s been like three days,” Siv teased even though I saw his tail wagging.

“We missed you too.” Telif squeezed me back before I heard him sniffing. “Is someone here?”

*Damn that schnoz.*

“Ugh, I wanted to surprise you, but you had to go and be a Mister Sniffy McSnifferson.”

“...what?”

“You heard me. Now wait here; I have a surprise for you.”

The two shared a look of confusion as I ran back downstairs to where Zeyth was waiting. She’d woken up in the time I was gone. I quickly explained what was going on, and assured her he was going to be happy to see her when a worried look spread over her face. I guided her back up the stairs, poking my head out to shout at Telif to close his eyes before the two of us entered the living room.

“Okay, open them!”

I stood there with my arms gesturing to Zeyth like I was a magician as Telif opened his eyes.

“Oh my god,” was all he said.

“H-hey, Tel-” She didn’t get to finish her sentence before Telif ran over and wrapped her in his arms as tears poured down his face. Zeyth quickly returned her embrace as the floodgates broke on her too.

“Zeyth, it’s really you,” he managed to get out. “I-I never thought I’d see you again.”

I saw a look of realization spread across Sivik’s face at her name. He didn’t say anything as a smile spread across his face and tears formed in his own eyes.

“I told you I’d find my way back to you,” she choked out as she pulled back from the hug and looked at Sivik. “Even if it looks like you already found someone else to take care of your soft ass.”

“Who you callin’ soft?” he replied in fake indignation. “I seem to remember saving your tail on multiple occasions.”

“Had to make you seem semi-competent so they didn’t find out you were defective,” she teased as she wiped away the tears.

“Hmmph, why did I miss you?” Telif gave her a playful shove.

“You did?” she practically whispered.

“Of course. You were the first friend I ever had.” He placed a paw on her shoulder. “I could never forget you.”

She didn’t say anything else. The two wrapped each other in their arms once more. I practically jumped out of my skin as Sivik snuck up next to me and tapped on my arm.

“Soooo, why did Telif smell her on you?” he whispered with that evil glint in his eyes.

“I, um, I’ll tell you later.”

“You’d better put a ring on that quick. I think Telif might be mad if you let her get deported after that.”

I felt my face turn bright red before I kicked his leg.

“Ahh, fucker.” Siv hissed, before cheating by hitting me back with the metal arm.

“What’s going on over there?” Telif asked, and I realized the two were staring at us.

“Oh, nothing,” Sivik replied with a tail flick. “Just asking Jakey boy here if he realizes you two are sword brothers now.”

*Who the fuck taught you that term?!?!*

Luckily it seemed neither of the Arxur knew what he was talking about, so I didn’t need to die from a brain hemorrhage in my own living room, as they both just gave a quizzical look.

“I’ll tell you later, love.” Sivik sauntered over to Telif, gesturing for him to bend down to give him a kiss, which the Arxur quickly obliged. “Zeyth, how long do you think you’ll be staying?”

“Oh, I’m not sure. I’m not really here legally, but the Yotul who smuggled me didn’t give me a deadline to return…”

“Well, I’m sure Tel *and* Jake are both more than happy to have you around for a while.”

*Gonna kill him. Gonna punt that Venlil into space.*

“So, while I would love to chat some more, I didn’t sleep a wink on the plane and am about to pass out standing up. Tel, love, can you grab our bag when you come join me?”

“Of course, sleep well.” He kissed his partner again.

“Take your time up here. I am sure you are eager to catch up with each other.” Siv clasped Zeyth’s paw. “It was lovely meeting you. We’ll have to share some embarrassing stories about Telif later.”

“I’d like that,” she replied as I noticed Telif’s scars turning red.

*At least I’m not the only one he’s torturing. Rat bastard.*

If Telif noticed how close Zeyth was sitting next to me when we moved to the couch, he luckily didn’t say anything. I mostly sat there listening as the two shared stories of their lives since they were separated around six years ago. Zeyth cried more when she heard how much time Telif spent trying to learn what happened to her after the war. Telif spent nearly an hour apologizing for the hurt he caused her when she thought he was dead. The two only stopped when their stomachs growled and we realized it was nearly four pm and none of us had eaten. Sivik had returned from his nap by then, so Telif and I went to work on food and let him keep Zeyth company for a bit. 

“I’m alright with it, you know,” Telif said once we were alone.

“Ah, so you noticed.” I felt my face flush again.

“Please, I’m not that dense anymore. Plus you were covered in each other's scent,” he teased.

“We just spooned!”

“I know.” He gave me a rough pat on the back. “Be good to her. She’s very important to me.”

“I will, I will.” I gave him a hug.

“I know you will. You’re the nicest man I know.” He hugged me back. “But what happened to only being into human women?”

“I dunno, man, her eyes are really pretty, and she flirted with me. I’m but a man. I’m not made of stone!”

“Is that all it takes, handsome?” he asked with a tail flick.

“Sorry, but I’m no homewrecker.” I gave him a shove.

“That’s alright. I’m only into good-looking people anyway.” He shoved me back.

“Bastard.” I replied as the two of us began preparing lunch I found myself hoping this would be far from the last time..

1q6ledd,https://i.redd.it/sbh9cew1oybg1.jpeg,Old-Fashioned Ways to Save Money That Still Work in 2026,"

In a world of subscription services, one-click purchases, and rising costs, many people are rediscovering the timeless frugal habits of past generations. These “old-fashioned” money-saving strategies—rooted in the resourcefulness of the Great Depression era, post-war thriftiness, and the practical wisdom of our grandparents—remain remarkably effective today. They focus on mindfulness, waste reduction, and self-reliance rather than deprivation, proving that small, consistent changes can lead to significant savings.

Here are ten proven old-fashioned methods to stretch your dollars further:

1. **Switch to Cash and Envelope Budgeting**  
   Using physical cash instead of credit or debit cards makes spending feel more real—it’s psychologically harder to hand over bills than to tap a card. The classic envelope system takes this further: allocate your monthly income into labeled envelopes for categories like groceries, entertainment, and transportation. When an envelope is empty, spending in that category stops until next month. This simple tactic curbs impulse buys and keeps you accountable.

2. **Collect Loose Change**  
   Empty your pockets daily into a jar, piggy bank, or old coffee tin. Over time, coins add up surprisingly fast. Many people find that a year’s worth of spare change can cover a utility bill, holiday gifts, or an emergency expense. It’s an effortless way to build savings without noticing the difference.

3. **Mend and Repair Clothing**  
   Instead of replacing worn items, learn basic sewing skills to fix tears, replace buttons, hem pants, or darn socks. Patching jeans or reinforcing elbows can double the lifespan of favorite pieces. In an age of fast fashion, this habit not only saves money but also reduces waste.

4. **Grow and Preserve Your Own Food**  
   Even a small backyard plot, balcony containers, or windowsill herbs can yield fresh produce at a fraction of grocery store prices. Preserve the harvest by canning, pickling, freezing, or dehydrating to enjoy home-grown food year-round and avoid expensive out-of-season items.

5. **Line-Dry Laundry**  
   Skip the electric dryer and hang clothes on a clothesline or drying rack. This reduces energy bills, extends fabric life by avoiding heat damage, and gives laundry that fresh outdoor scent many people love.

6. **Cook from Scratch and Embrace Leftovers**  
   Preparing meals with basic ingredients costs far less than pre-packaged foods or takeout. Turn leftovers into new dishes—yesterday’s roast becomes tomorrow’s soup or sandwiches. Save vegetable scraps for homemade stock, and bake your own bread for pennies per loaf.

7. **Shop Secondhand First**  
   Thrift stores, garage sales, consignment shops, and online marketplaces offer quality clothing, furniture, books, and household goods at steep discounts. Buying used keeps perfectly good items out of landfills while keeping more money in your pocket.

8. **Cut Utility Waste**  
   Adopt habits like turning off lights when leaving a room, unplugging unused electronics, lowering the thermostat and wearing layers, or taking shorter showers. These small actions compound into noticeable reductions on monthly bills.

9. **Make Homemade Cleaners**  
   Everyday ingredients like white vinegar, baking soda, lemon, and castile soap can replace most commercial cleaning products. These DIY solutions cost pennies per batch, work effectively, and avoid harsh chemicals.

10. **Borrow, Barter, and Use the Library**  
    Libraries offer free books, audiobooks, magazines, movies, and even tools or seeds in some locations. Borrow from friends or neighbors instead of buying infrequently used items. Consider bartering skills or goods—trading garden produce for a haircut, for example.

These old-fashioned practices aren’t about living sparingly for its own sake; they’re about intentional living and financial freedom. Start with one or two that resonate most with your lifestyle, and gradually incorporate others. Over time, you’ll likely find that these habits not only save money but also bring a satisfying sense of control and simplicity to everyday life. In 2026, as in decades past, frugality remains a powerful tool for building wealth and peace of mind.",1,1767806403.0,news_nest,0,1.0,False
1q6ldqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6ldqy,Suggestions For Increasing Sidewalk Visibility,"Hello! I am not a coffee shop owner, but I am an avid coffee shop goer, and have been part of a community group that meets regularly at a small, queer, independently run coffee shop for the past couple of years. Aside from visiting at least once a week, I have financially backed their other ventures, including a community food and hygiene  bank, free community potlucks, and a free lending library, because I think these are good things and am glad they exist.

Over that time I've gotten to know the owner, and he is very open about the highs and lows of being a small business owner in this economy. Last year, he moved locations to a new storefront, which was not ready for him until several months after he was meant to reopen. Since reopening, he has had significantly less foot traffic than at his previous location. He attributes this to lack of visibility; the front of the building looks like an apartment, and people frequently miss the door, since it is tucked into an alley.

I'm here to ask for some recommendations or advice for how to cost effectively improve visibility. He has mentioned that he doesn't currently have the finances to greatly invest in additional signage, but if I get the right direction  to go in in terms of what will get more people through the door, I am confident that I will be able to crowdfund for the improvements.

So; what has worked for you all? Hanging tavern style signs? Window painting? A colorful door? Sidewalk mural? I have attached two pictures from streetview as references, the amorphous blobs are covering identifying information (which may seem counterintuitive but I wanted to respect the no promotion rule). The alleyway with the car leads down to the barrier-free entrance, but most folks come in through the door with the two stairs

So hopefully I do this right. As title states my best friend's step daughter has a friend who called the police on her and told a lie and now she in jail. 

I received a text from my best friend(going to call her BFF) Fiance that contained a screen shot of an arrest log. I called and went to voice mail but was able to get a text as they are currently waiting at the court house for court hearing. 

Apparently last night a friend of the families called the police saying BFF grabbed her step daughter by the pony tail and slammed her into the floor. The police came and arrested BFF and deemed the home unsafe and let the step daughter stay at said family friends home. 

Little thing about BFF step daughter everyone has to  be informed with for context. She is a liar. She lies all the time even when no need to lie. She is autistic and a few other labels that they are not sure about due to never seeing the evaluation but recently having her reevaluated again so they can know what is going on. The girl once told a friend she was forced to eat hot sauce as punishment when in the end BFF and her step son order hot sauces around the world. The step daughter wanted to try it but BFF kept telling her no, you hate hot food you can't handle this. She cry and whine and then BFF said get some milk and dont complain when its too hot after being warned for over an hr. Well it happened. This lie and a few others was told to a friend of the girls and that friend mother called CPS. CPS did do a full investigation and the step daughter eventually told the truth. The case was closed. Once she was told you can drink what ever Poppi soda you want just please leave this certain flavor alone. The girl drank all of them and when asked about it she lied. She was the only home and when she wasn't she was the only one Physically able to get to the fridge. BFF mom who use to stay with them was physically unable to walk and wheelchair was too big for their tiny trailer and she loves and breaths coffee and pepsi. I could go on and on about lies and such. Some are minor but some are major. Once accused brother of something bad and then she admitted the truth. Now no one is allowed to be alone due to her lies. 

Anywho, Now they have BFF in jail waiting for court hearing. She suffers from depression, PTSD, ADHD, and massive anxiety. She wouldn't hurt a fly. She her self has been trying to get her step daughter help. They have put her in different therapies family, individual, group, even some life skill ones but nothing. The step daughter is 16 and now is staying at this friends house who called the police. From what i know the friend manipulated the girl to lie and called the police. 

At this point BFF and her Wife now don't know what to do with the daughter. She is 16 lies and just in my opinion a risk for her self and others. She is not aware of things doesn't understand most things at 16. She has a mind of a 10 year old but yet now her lies are so bad its getting people arrested. Is there something they can do to help her? 

I am sorry this is all over i am just getting text as we go and filling in what i know from past experiences. My BFF is 34 female and her wife is i think 38 female. her step son is 18 step daughter is 16 and the ""family friend"" is female i think 26. Any Advice would be great.

Follow up to my post from a few days ago.

**The Context:** My friend runs a Home Decor brand. He pivoted from FB Ads to TikTok Seeding (sending free product to micro-influencers).

**The Problem:** He was sending out \~40 units a month. He was tracking everything in a messy Google Sheet. He had no idea if they actually posted unless he manually checked their profiles every day. He was losing hours of time and felt like he was just throwing product into a black hole.

**The Solution:** I’m a dev, so I told him I’d try to automate it. I spent the last 48 hours chugging coffee and building a custom ""Mission Control"" dashboard inside his Shopify admin.

**What I built:**

1. **Auto-Detection:** You input the influencer's handle. The app listens for new posts.
2. **The ""Spike"" Graph:** This is the cool part. I overlaid his **Shopify Search Volume** on top of the **Influencer Post Times**.
3. **Result:** We can finally see the ""Ghost Lift."" When u/user123 posted yesterday, search volume spiked 40% immediately. We never would have attributed that sale to her without the graph.

**The Ask:** I’m still refining the code (it's built on Next.js/Remix). Before I polish it up, **does anyone else here track Seeding manually?**

I’m happy to let a few people try this prototype for free in exchange for feedback. I just want to see if this is actually useful to anyone besides my friend.

1q6la49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q6la49/look_what_i_dragged_in_part_1/,Look what I dragged in [Part 1],"I feel like a lot of people underestimate the unknown, or rather, they overestimate what they know. We boast about our knowledge of the world around us, we do so with such vigor that sometimes we fall into a trap of feeling as if there isn’t anything large left for us to learn. This knowledge leads to a severe lack of fear when it comes to considering what dangers exist in our cities and towns. If we didn’t chart out ecosystems and predict the weather changes around us, life would be a lot more scary. It’s hard for anything from the natural world to come as a blatant surprise these days when we have long been hounding it for answers and details as to how it works.



And yet, to this day, we are still discovering new species of animals. Whether they’re tucked deep in the foliage of our rainforests or lurking thousands of feet beneath the ocean’s surface, we don’t know everything that’s out there.. And that is something that really shouldn’t be glossed over as much as it is. Because when you are not prepared to see something that defies every expectation you had set for the environment you inhabit, you are reduced to nothing else than a clueless deer in headlights. Can do nothing more than watch it hurdle towards you and pray it doesn't hurt as much as you know it could.



In my town, you can find this lack of fear rampant in the people that live here. It’s a little backwater pit not far from nowhere, with nothing but trees and barren roads for what felt like miles in every direction. The youth resent how constricting and quiet it is, nothing more than an eighteen year sentence to serve before escaping into college. A sentiment I find myself sympathising with these days. 



On the other hand, it’s almost a paradise for newly-weds and parents-to-be. Because above all else, this little pit next to nowhere was safe. Always had been. The chances of someone even knowing it existed if they didn’t live there was slim to none. Very rarely did anyone new ever accidentally stumble in, and even rarer did they stick around afterwards.



But as I said earlier, being lenient with your expectations is a valuable skill to practice. There are always exceptions made to rules that may seem set in stone at one point or another. And when you realise that, you can finally acknowledge the true horror that resides behind the idea of danger cropping up in a place where the populace haven’t yet learned how to be scared. Where it almost never has a chance to fester.



The key word being almost.



I’ll sum it all up as best that I can, having started about a couple of months ago. Back when this stray cat started making the rounds by our house almost every day. It was this skinny little thing that was usually covered in some sort of filth. It had slightly sunken eyes that almost looked sad, and a pitiful gait. Despite the numerous complaints from my parents, I had decided to start slipping it some food whenever it would drop by. A decision I obsess over now.



My parents didn’t want me to encourage it to stick around. They’d always say it was a waste of cat food that should be going to our actual cat and that they didn’t want any fighting going on in their backyard between them. I didn’t blame them for thinking that. Pipsqueak had always been extremely aggressive and territorial to most things that weren’t human, and there was always the risk of the stray bringing disease into our house whether it affected me or Pip. Especially considering we had a cat flap it could easily access. Or rather, a dog flap that only Pip now used since our dog passed away a few years ago.



But despite this, I insisted on continuing this routine because it was one of the few interesting things that had occurred in my daily life for as long as I had remembered. Something unpredicted that added a sliver of spontaneity into my otherwise completely unremarkable day. Every night I would find myself leaving that stupid bowl out for this random cat that didn’t even always pay a visit. I knew Pipsqueak wasn’t appreciative of the habit, but I figured it wasn’t too big of a deal. Usually by the time I’d leave the food out she was already snuggled up on my bed half-asleep and she wasn’t nearly as nocturnal as most cats seemed to be. 



It soon stopped being this arbitrary thing I decided to do every night and became incorporated into my everyday schedule. I would brush my teeth, set out the bowl, and then I would go to bed. That was my nightly routine. Sometimes the stray would be waiting for me outside, and sometimes it wouldn’t. As the days went on, it would show up more and more. It started to put on a bit of weight, and its raspy noises from before turned into something closer to an actual meow. Once, I even caught it attempting to lick itself clean before I announced my presence by opening the backdoor. Whether or not I saw it at night, the bowl was always licked perfectly clean by morning.



On one of these fateful nights, there was a slight deviation to the usual programme I had established with the feline. At the time I brushed it off as some minor oddity and didn’t really think much of it. It’s with the help of hindsight that I can realise how small things like these can snowball into something much more than a “minor oddity”.



It was later than when I usually brought the food out, maybe half an hour or so. I was in the kitchen pouring some of our cat kibble into the bowl I had designated for this nightly ritual. My mother was across the open area sitting at our dining table, having been mostly silent for the last while. But she eventually spoke up.



“Do you ever plan to stop feeding that mangy thing?” She spoke in an almost off-handed manner. A comment she was accustomed to making whenever she caught me this late in the kitchen with the cat food.



I had anticipated the mildly disgusted tone, but it never made me somewhat defensive over my night-time visitor. Even if it made me feel somewhat silly deep down. I wasn’t a kid anymore, but that condescending tone had a habit of spiralling me straight back down into the cradle.



“Not really, Ma.” I mumbled in response, not quiet but unintelligible all the same. 



I grabbed the bowl and walked over to our backdoors. They were made of glass so I took the time to peer through intently, hoping to see the familiar sight of wide green eyes reflecting the porchlight back at me. While they were absent on that occasion, I still opened the door to go and place the food outside. My Mother muttered something as I did so. It was some other exasperated comment about what I was doing so I didn’t say anything in response, and I shut the door behind me.



I put the bowl in its usual spot near the door, calling out for the stray with the shushing sound it often responded to. But I saw and heard nothing. There weren’t any quiet mewls or chitters in the distance nor were there any furry looking shadows dancing around in the bushes that lined our porch barrier. The stray often jumped up in the wide gap between the spindles right into the shrubbery from the space behind the ledge, but that night wasn’t one of those nights.



I recall that I found myself mildly disappointed it hadn’t dropped by to skulk around for a bit, but all I did was call out one last time before withdrawing back into the house. I couldn’t bring myself to be annoyed at its absence when it wasn't even technically our cat. Pipsqueak was waiting for me upstairs on my bed, after all. Maybe I just missed seeing a fresh face, even if it belonged to some random animal. I knew I needed to get out more.



By the time I was in bed it was around eleven. It never really took me too long to fall asleep. Pip had settled against one of my legs atop the duvet, basically gone already. I shoved my phone under my pillow and shut my eyes, drifting to sleep as normally as I usually did.



A few hours later, I found myself awake for no immediate reason I could determine. It didn’t bother me too much, as I could usually fall asleep again as quickly as I woke up. And it wasn’t completely unheard of for Pipsqueak to wake me up on the odd occasion, whether it was her moving or her oddly loud snores. I had assumed the latter that night until I realised she wasn’t there. I didn’t feel the usual pressure on my legs or a gentle honking sound emanating from across the blanket.



I sat up, confirming that she wasn’t there. Not out of the ordinary, sometimes Pip would take a wander during the night. And more often than not I’d slam my head straight back down and nod off. But when I moved, I instantly grimaced at the feeling of saliva smeared across my face. I wiped it off in confusion at the unexpected feeling. I hadn’t known myself to be a big drooler in my sleep, so I wasn’t used to the unpleasant sensation of slobber being spread against my mouth and chin. The feeling of it encrusted between my gums.



I decided to go and get some water to wash it out, and that it wasn’t worth going to sleep trying to cope with the gross feeling. I flicked on the lamp by my bed and scooted over to the edge. I paused for a moment, taking the time to listen out for the sound of our cat’s claws clicking against the wooden floorboards. Aside from the stifled hum of our fridge downstairs, I heard nothing but silence inside the house, while wind raged against our walls outside. There was a loud rattling accompanying it, the sound of our botched shed door below my window. I had been begging for my father to fix it since, as it wasn’t uncommon for the sound to rouse me.



I stood up, trying not to feel as if I was intruding on my own residence and made my way downstairs. I was careful to avoid the boards I knew had a mean creak to them as I did so, even in the pitch-blackness. I didn’t see Pipsqueak once as I went.



I stumbled into the kitchen, only turning on the dim counter lights to illuminate the rest of the way. I filled a glass with tap water, taking a sip to swish around my mouth and spit into the sink. I was about to do it one more time, but soon stopped with the glass pressed against my lips. I heard something outside on the porch.



I recognized the sound pretty easily, it was the scraping of ceramic against wood. I heard it often weeks ago when the stray got exceptionally excited about a meal, eating so aggressively it kept accidentally hitting its nose against the edge of the bowl and consequently shoving it away. I put the glass down and walked over to the backdoors to go and greet the cat, but when I came into view, it had left. The noise had stopped sometime while I walked over, and when I looked out there was no sign of any creature having been there. Just the bowl, almost completely empty, and farther away from the door than I had ever seen it. Almost right up against the wooden railings and plants. My eyes darted around to try and find a glimpse of a tail, eye, anything.



But it was just darkness and meaningless silhouettes. I reached my hand out to tug on the door handle, having half a mind to call out for it in the middle of the night. But I changed my mind. And I dropped my hand down a bit further to turn the lock instead. We didn’t often lock it, our yard was enclosed in a fence and, once again, our area was remarkably crime-free. But for some reason on that particular night, I felt the urge to strive for security instead of searching for a random cat that was probably only using me for food.



As I looked out into the void of my backyard, I was brought back to a time when I was younger, tugging on my mother’s jeans and begging her to shut the blinds at night so I wouldn’t have to see the blank nothingness on the other side of the glass. Or at least that’s what she believed me to be frightened of. Something I never told her was that I was far more worried of what could have been looking in. All the while I remained unaware as I basked in the light of the inside. That I was under the illusion I was safe. This trepidation faded with age, but I felt it a bit back in that moment.



I scanned the porch one last time, eyes lingering on the bowl that seemed almost miles away before turning and leaving. I flicked the kitchen light on the way out, leaving only darkness behind me. When I got to my bedroom door, I realised Pipsqueak had returned.

She stared at me from the bed while I stood in the dark hallway, eyes half-lidded and curious. I stayed for a moment more, a smile creeping onto my face at the sight of her head lowering onto the blanket as if it weighed a hundred pounds. 



I left the door partially ajar behind me in case she wished to leave during the night. As I crawled back into bed, I made sure to flip my pillow before putting my head anywhere near. I felt Pip stretch her small paws on top of me before I fell asleep again.



In the morning that followed, I had closed the front door behind me and was halfway down our driveway when I was stopped by a polite meow coming from my left. Under the hedge, I saw what used to be my nocturnal visitor. The stray was crouched under one of our hedges, and when it noticed my staring it stood up and pranced over with a few quiet murrs. It coiled around my leg and looked up at me almost expectantly. It seemed rather hungry despite the fact it should have eaten earlier in the morning. It was then that the previous oddity from last night had some sort of an explanation.



I assumed that a fox or some other type of animal in the area had crept into our garden and eaten the food instead of the stray. And that the cat had probably avoided the garden because it knew there was some bigger animal back there that it didn’t want to get too close to. That was the only reason I could think of that would make it skip out on our usual deal. I grabbed a different bowl from the kitchen to leave its food in, this time beside our front door and headed on my way to the bus stop. With that revelation in mind, that was when the adjustments had first begun. Where it all began, really.



In the following two weeks I began to leave the bowl at our front door instead of on the porch. Whatever animal had eaten the food had probably crept in from the big back road behind our house, as it was pretty easy for most animals to find a way through our wooden fences. Not to mention the road was surrounded by fields and trees, a hotspot for wildlife. You wouldn’t really find many interesting things around here other than the occasional fox or rabbit. But either way, I didn’t want whatever it was sticking around in case it was on the more dangerous side. I had more than one cat to keep safe around the place at this point, no matter what my mother said.



However, after those two weeks I had to return to using the back porch. Other neighbourhood pets were becoming interested in our house, and my parents didn’t really appreciate that. So after enough complaining I soon started placing it back by our glass doors. It wasn’t too big of a deal, though. I figured the unwanted guest that had robbed the food was long gone by now.



Right before I did, I remember my father mentioning some peculiar sights he had noticed on the roads the past week or so. I had barely been listening, as I was busy opening a fresh bag of cat kibble until I noticed the disbelief in his tone.



“Swear to God, I’ve seen about six this week alone. Mangled little bastards.” He had grumbled, rolling a cigarette at the kitchen table next to my mother.



I had hummed in acknowledgement, not too alarmed by it. It made sense. It was badger season, more were gonna be crossing the roads, more were going to be hit by cars, and there were going to be more corpses on the roads. Not to mention the fact he worked the night shift every other week, driving to work right around where badgers would be most active. But I was somewhat caught off-guard by the disgust he displayed at the memory. I had never known him to be even slightly squeamish. Although I imagine seeing mashed animal corpses plaguing the roads every night could be unnerving to anybody. I wish I had asked more questions about the badgers, but I instead left him to discuss it with my mother so I could bring the usual bowl of food out to the front of the house.



The stray wasn’t there, which had become a more common occurrence over the past while. So I just gave the drive-way a half hearted glance before turning to go back inside. Before I opened the door I caught sight of something on the adjoining window. 



A patch of it was foggy, and had a few small droplets trickling further down the lower pane. Like a weeping cloud had been trapped inside. It hadn’t been raining, but it was freezing out so I realised it was condensation. Something had been breathing against the glass not too long ago. And when I looked closer, there were patterns wiped into the material. The marks were lined with traces of a thick, bubbly froth, left by a tongue that had swiped across the splotch in a crude zig-zag. Far too big to belong to a cat.



Mildly perturbed, I crouched down to try and get a closer look. I didn’t touch it, of course, as I didn’t know what had left it. It wasn’t low enough on the pane to be a cat, badger or any other animal I knew that lived in our area. Though, at the time, I chalked it up to one of the neighbour’s dogs getting too interested in the food I was leaving out. Or at least that’s the explanation I forced myself to believe. I zoned out while thinking about it, unconsciously peering through the glass into the house behind. I stared for a long moment, goose bumps shuddered up my arm that I couldn't just chalk up to the cold.



I saw into our kitchen through the hallway door we almost always left open. I saw our counter, and the bag of cat food lying on top of it.



I looked over my shoulder, both relieved and disappointed to see nothing behind me. And then I re-entered the house without sparing the window a second glance. However I continued to dwell on it for the following couple of days, and started shutting doors in the house with more regularity. Alongside whatever curtains and blinds I could.



Things returned to a sense of normalcy after that. I started feeding the stray a bit earlier, usually when the sun just started setting. And when I could, I'd stick around for the fifteen or so minutes it needed to eat. Just in case whatever had been back here hadn't completely moved on. At the time, I was almost certain it had.



It got to the point where I was feeling comfortingly alone in the areas around our house, but achingly lonely when inside. It was pathetic, really, but whenever I caught a window downstairs that was uncovered at night it made me sick to my stomach. The idea that something could be looking in at me while I remained clueless haunted me, the remnants of a childhood fear that refused to move on. I'd awkwardly shimmy to the side of the window, trying not to look out whenever I needed to close it. 



Eventually, maybe inevitably, I was late again. The moon was already out, and the porch was a similar darkness to what I had been used to weeks ago. Nothing but vague shapes and shadows that blended together into different darker and threatening shades of black. But nonetheless, I placed the bowl down and called out for my visitor. I thought it was going to be one of those nights where it bailed on me. I had learned that if it wasn't already waiting on me, nine times out of ten it wasn't going to show up until much later. Right when I was about to turn in, I was pleasantly surprised.



I caught a glimpse of it underneath the bushes lining our porch. Looking up at me, reflecting the porch light with its tell-tale, greeny mirror eyes. I recall with vivid clarity the confusion as to why it didn't come up to greet me or make a move toward the bowl. And how that confusion turned to unease. An inexplicable discomfort that had settled like lead weights deep in my limbs. 



I couldn't decipher it at the time, but there was something profoundly wrong with the way the stray had looked at me. Somehow, even though I could only make out its glowing eyes, I could tell it was off in some way. It was just the way it was acting, or lack thereof, at first. But then I started to notice the minor things.



Its eyes were so small, and had a larger distance between them than I had remembered. And it didn’t seem to be crouching under the bush, it would have needed to be leaning onto its hind legs to get its eyes up that high. It was if it wasn’t nestled under the plants, rather sticking its head through the bannister from the other side. Just looking at it made me nauseous.



I think it sensed that I clocked its sheer strangeness, because it moved.



Slowly, as if it were dragging itself with great effort, it slinked backwards off the porch, shifting silently on the earth behind it. Its gaze never left me as it did so, being the only way to tell it was completely out of view. Its blank neon eyes dissipated into the darkness. But I knew it had remained. It was just out of sight now.



Only when that stare broke from me could I regain motor function, walking slowly backwards on legs I barely remembered how to use. I reached a shaky hand for the door handle, almost tearing it off with how tightly and firmly I shoved it down. I quickly stumbled in and whipped around to lock the door. Not even the jitters in my extremities could deter me from double and triple checking that door was thoroughly unopenable from the outside. And then I roughly forced the curtains over the glass, as if that added some sort of extra protection.



I blocked it out at the time. But I definitely saw it staring at me again when I drew the curtains, this time peeking at me from over the porch steps.



I went to bed that night at war with myself, trying to rationalise what I had seen. That it was just a harmless animal that had wandered into our yard. But there's no arguing with fear. I didn't know what I had seen, but I knew that it made me afraid. You could call your fear as irrational as you'd like, that didn't make it go away. It stuck with you and fermented into a noxious, suffocating presence. Sometimes you get used to that presence, tolerating it out of nothing more than pure habit.



I couldn't stand the way those dark corners of my room looked at me while I tried to sleep. So I had to leave the lamp on, just to provide a sense of solace. Not that Pipsqueak needed any as she was already unconscious at the end of the bed, gently honking away. Admittedly it probably brought more comfort than the room being illuminated. 



And with that in mind I fell into an uneasy sleep, but fortunately, dreamless. Not any that I remember, anyway. Which on one hand I was grateful for, I don't want to know what my imagination would have in store for me in such a rattled state. But on the other hand, my brain never needed to bear the burden of concocting a horrific scenario for me. Not with what happened after I woke up a few hours later to an odd pressure on my leg.



My common sense was muffled when I first roused. I looked over my shoulder to find the source of the feeling. I spotted Pipsqueak straight away, the lamp across the room emphasising her silhouette. Her front paws were standing on my shin to stare over my body almost painfully. The fear didn't even get a chance to settle before it went away. And I almost laughed. I almost playfully swatted at her so she'd move. But instead, naturally, I turned to try and find whatever had her rapt attention. 



And then the fear came hurdling back with a mean bite.



My eyes met the bedroom door, and then the absolute darkness that laid behind. The light from my room blocked out anything and everything that could have been beyond the threshold of my doorframe. And yet, when I locked onto the five inch gap between door and wall I was overwhelmed with the devastating feeling of wanting to flee and having nowhere I could run to. Once again, my body knew long before I did that something was amiss, something that my brain struggled significantly to cope with.



Maybe it was simply just Pip and the way she was staring so intently into that void. Or maybe it was my brain picking up on things I didn't know it was capable of, something in the air I couldn't grasp consciously. Whichever it was didn't matter. All I knew was that when I looked into that hallway, I was supposed to be scared.



I knew something was there. And I knew it was looking back.



And after a moment of having that realisation stew in the air, the impromptu staring contest extending between us, it moved first.



A gentle creak rang out from the abyss, short, probably no more than two seconds long. More than enough to make me want to puke out all my organs so there wasn’t anything left for terror to tear at. Pip’s claws were digging into my flesh through all the fabric, but I couldn’t move no matter how much I wanted to. I was paralysed from my scalp and downwards. Head empty aside from flickering through my own fabrications of whatever stood outside. Each time with more teeth, claws and matted fur. We remained at that stalemate for a while, a minute that morphed into an eternity of hell I had never considered to exist. Then I heard something again, this time louder than before. And it wretched air from my frozen lungs.



I heard a brief scraping against the floorboards, and then a dreadful thunder as it clambered down the stairs in a clumsy manner. I heard it clipping its limbs on the wooden edges, sliding back and forth across them and rattling the bannister under the force of each awkward step it took. I wouldn’t begin to call its movements purposeful as it basically fell down the stairs, only propelled by the occasional purchase it managed to get as it scrabbled and writhed downwards. 



Then there was silence for a small moment, a scarily small moment. Right before the sound of our cat flap downstairs swinging back and forth. 



Pip moved about two seconds before I did, launching off the bed and shooting into the hallway. Her feet moved with confident thumps down the stairs, and I quickly followed while turning on every light that was in reach along the way. When we got to the kitchen I beelined to the cat flap and slid the lock across the bottom, kicking it with my foot to make sure it didn’t budge.



It was at this point that the slight paranoia I maintained over the previous few weeks devolved into a dreadful reality I couldn’t ignore. I checked all the doors and windows on our ground floor twice before retreating to my room. I ensured that I hit the latch on that too, one that had been practically untouched in years before. Not that I fell back asleep later that night, the whole incident left a haunting taste in my mouth. I just laid on my side, staring at the door for hours on end. I had expected it to open again at any second, and remained like that until the sun intruded through my window.



I saw my mother later, sitting at the kitchen table in plain view of the porch. The curtains I had yanked closed in panic what felt like eons ago were fully open to bask the room in warm rays. It sickened me. I stopped midway towards my mother, right between where the kitchen window ended and the backdoor began. I hesitated with my words, stumbling over them before they had even left my head. But I forced something out anyway, knowing they would never evolve into anything eloquent.



“Something came in through the cat flap last night. I heard it in the hallway, and it ran back out.” I babbled out dumbly, finding myself incapable of conveying the terror that I associated with the memory. I made it sound like a small little incident to be laughed about, and I was frustrated. Yet I still looked at my mother expectantly for an answer while not even knowing what type I wanted.



“Ah, I was wondering why it was locked.” She responded simply, looking at me over her mug of coffee as she took a gulp of it. As if she hadn’t a bother on her. It annoys me even now.



I don’t remember what exactly I said next, just a passive-aggressive comment about keeping all entrances locked from there on out. To which my mother agreed, in an extremely calm and nonchalant manner that only proceeded to further irritate me as I listened with vicious envy. I stood there for a second, mouth bobbing with things I wanted to say, things I should have said, before I turned around to leave. But then she spoke with words I had heard before and stopped me at the door. It was familiar, and I wanted to hear it again.



“What’s that?” I quickly shot back, not having been listening properly the first time around.



“I said I told you so. That you’d drag in more than just a cat.” She mused, almost smugly. She then focused back on her phone. Either completely oblivious to or revelling in my dissatisfaction. It was true. She had said that before. 



I only remember it vaguely, sometime right before the schedule between me and the stray had become so irregular. I gently closed the door behind me, leaving with limbs that took more effort to move than I wanted to admit.



School was longer than usual that day. And in all honesty, I was glad for it. I wasn’t exactly eager to go home. So much so, that when it ended I decided to skip out on the bus home. I instead accompanied some friends into town, none of which I had ever really hung out with outside school. But we were just close enough that they didn’t care, even if I could read the confusion on their faces. I walked after them, occasionally chiming in with my two cents when prodded but other than that I was glued to my own thoughts. Wondering what to do when I got home or when I had to toss in the towel and head to the bus stop. I was struck with the urge to relay last night’s events to the others, maybe grasping for some semblance of an explanation or answer. Or hell, maybe some advice. So when one of my mates, Theo,  asked me what I had been up to, I didn’t resist the impulse.



“Somethin’ weird happened to me last night."" I started, as casually as I could. And the rest of my explanation was of a similar tone.



When I finished regaling, I was predictably met with a few laughs and grimaces. I explained it better this time, emphasising how oddly the way it tumbled down the stairs was. I got poked for some details here and there, but regardless, nothing noteworthy had really been said.



“Jaysus lad, the fecking Scrambler came after ya.” One of them jested, another round of laughs echoing through the street. I chuckled along, but once again found myself extremely discontent with the reactions I had been receiving. And while I was irked back then, I understand it a lot more now.



From an outside perspective, I was getting worked up over a harmless animal. They hadn’t seen the eyes peering from the darkest corners of our property nor had they heard the creaks and scrapes that accompanied every move the creature made. They hadn’t felt the stubborn unease that refused to dissolve in its presence. I knew it was more than just being shaken up, I knew this threat to be an absolute fact. Which made my continuous habit of brushing it off all the more infuriating to look back on.



Theo tried to poke at me for more details about the previous night but I deflected them. I didn’t want to think about it any longer, and decided to focus on the others. All now going on about their own cats.



I took the latest possible bus I could later that day, and spent the entire trip back home staring out the window in silence. I spotted something dead on the road. It was too mutilated and disfigured to make out what it was. But it was obvious that not just a car was to blame for its misfortune, whatever it may have been. I couldn’t stop myself from looking at it until the bus forced it out of view, and the image only further unsettled me.



I had decided on a strict set of rules by the time I got home. Simple but effective. I would continue to leave food out on the porch while it was still bright, but I wouldn’t be lingering anymore. I no longer wanted to be stood on that porch when I didn’t have to be. All windows and doors would be locked and double-checked by the time I was in bed. Most particularly, that goddamn cat flap. Whenever I could get away with it, I’d shut the curtains and blinds. Even during the day, which may have been overboard, but if it brought peace of mind I didn’t really care.



I stuck to it rather rigorously, more than I expected. It blended into my routine the following week, fit in snugly right alongside brushing my teeth and leaving out the cat food. And it brought a whole world of comfort. I still slept facing the door with my back to the window, but that was the worst of what remained from the night of ‘The Scrambler’. Of course, anyone with half a brain could tell you what I’ll say now.



You can’t block out your problems forever.



They’re tricky little things, always adapting and finding ways to worm their way back to you. Pests that can never quite get the hint, no matter how hard you kick or how loud you scream.



It was late at night, and I awoke for no immediately discernible reason. Not out of the ordinary as of recent, but I was on edge as the past incidents came to mind. I stared at my bedroom door, perfectly illuminated and securely latched closed. Nothing was going to get in. Only when I repeated that over and over in my head did I relax, and notice a lack of cat resting against my leg.



I rolled over to see if Pip was even on the bed, and she was. She sat up, her back facing me. I assumed her movement was what had woke me up, and I quietly called out to her. But she ignored me, and continued to ignore me even when I reached out and brushed my fingers against her fur. I stared at her, puzzled, and shifted up onto my elbow. Then I acknowledged the window she was most definitely staring through.



I could’ve passed out with the haunting feeling that curdled in my stomach. The kind of alarm that’s molded from the most potent of paranoia dragged from childhood to modern day and made into reality. The type of terror that was no longer confined to the mind. Not when your own cat was awake and staring it down for you. I could barely twitch my muscles, that's how obstinate my body’s reactions had become. But I had to know. I had to see.



Almost mechanically, I pushed myself up onto my knees. Trying to follow Pip’s line of sight. But it wasn’t going to be enough. There was only my own white reflection staring back, glossy eyes meeting glass ones. I breathed for a moment, sliding backwards off the bed to stand beside the light switch. My gaze never drifted from the window as I did so. My hand lifted up in a manner almost too quick and easy, like all bets with gravity were off. I felt around the switch, dragging my fingers up to the higher end of the pivot. And I lightly pressed down, just enough to allow the darkness to encase my room.



I couldn’t begin to precisely describe what I saw. But I remember with skin crawling accuracy the way all oxygen was robbed from my lungs, and the way my body pathetically slumped against the wall for support while my legs failed me. Last time, I saw too little. This time I had seen too much. It was looking at me.



It was standing on our shed. Perfectly upright like a person. But I knew better than that now.



It was skinny, thin in places I didn’t think possible. It’s a mystery that it was able to uphold such a human posture, its legs looked like it should crumble beneath its body faster than mine did in that moment. I could see its eyes locked onto me, neon, familiar and still entirely unwelcome. Its head had the shape of a peeled bat, skin wrapped tightly around skull and thin ears that pointed outwards like clock hands. Everything was too long, where its limbs started and ended was obscure. Something hung from under its mouth. I couldn’t see its face, or maybe just couldn’t make it out through my panicked haze. I had seen enough to justify my erratic heartbeat, and proceeded to swing my door open.



I scrambled into the hallway.



Only when the door slammed shut behind me could I breathe again. Every kind that ranged from desperate shuddering to greedy gulps, whatever I needed to bring my body back to a state of functionality. 



I sat there huddled on the dark hallway floor for the remainder of the night, dwelling over the hundreds of questions running through my head, none of which I had a single definitive answer for. I tried not to vomit whenever my mind conjured up the image, unable to stop myself from wondering if it had been watching me all week. Gawking at me and mocking my attempts to keep it at bay as it stared at my sleeping form. I shivered and curled in on myself tighter, feeling immensely disturbed by the idea and how probable it was.



Here’s the thing about even the mightiest of predators. They spend a lot of their time sizing up prey, weighing out the reward and comparing it to the risk. They carefully calculate whether or not a meal will be worth the effort and energy they expend hunting it down. All the while, some poor creature is unheeding to the danger that lurks until it’s far too late. At that moment, I got a pretty good sense of how it felt to be that unknowing creature. My mom found me asleep in the hallway the next day, neck killing me.



I think it’s the intelligence that scared me the most back then, as if the visage of it wasn’t enough to give anyone nightmares for weeks. But the way it stalked so easily out of sight and the rapidness in which it adapted its techniques was nothing I had ever seen before. I practically grew up watching Brave Wilderness and National Geographic. I knew animals more than most, and this thing defied all expectations I had ever set.



The way it stood in such a human manner made me wonder if it was possibly capable of opening doors. I was grateful I had been neurotically locking everything in sight recently, all of a sudden. As long as it remained out there while I remained inside, it’d be fine, wouldn’t it?



That is what I chose to believe.

Yesterday and today she posted two stories acting like she is so upset with Liam being in school (coughdaycarecough) because she was getting blasted on here for acting like she had ten cups of coffee and won the lottery after dropping him off the first time. It is so funny because it is so apparent that she is full of shit. 

Also it seems she is putting him in daycare full time. Why? Why is she dumping him off to have other people basically raise him? So she can frolic around stores and ignore Emma all day? And think about it, she is potentially withholding a spot from a family that ACTUALLY needs the care. To me personally, no reason why a child needs to be in full time daycare with two stay at home parents (yes Larry may work, seems it is only part time and nights) 

You know how many people would kill to be in her position? Parents that actually have to work full time and feel they don't spend enough time with their children? She is just so ungrateful. Imagine exploiting the IVF community and paying thousands of dollars and acting like this..

The staff of Anteiku, _Tokyo Ghoul_

In _Tokyo Ghoul_, ghouls are human in appearance but constantly hunger for human flesh. No other food can sate them. Many ghouls give in to this hunger and slaughter humans for food, but some fight against their urges and try their best to live in peace among humans. The staff of the Anteiku coffee shop source human flesh and blood responsibly, mix it into coffee made just for ghouls, and try to live otherwise normal lives. 

The Cullen family, _Twilight_

Like most vampires in vampire fiction, vampires in _Twilight_ are immortal humans who have a strong thrust for human blood. Many vampires in _Twilight_ - including the Volturi, the vampire leadership - are only concerned with maintaining their existence a secret while they slaughter humans for their blood. But the Cullen family resists this urge and only drinks the blood of animals, not humans. 

Omeluum, _Baldur's Gate III_

Omeluum is a mind flayer, and mind flayers need to eat brains to live. They're also under the power of an elder brain, a monstrously powerful giant tentacled brain that commands them telepathically. Omeluum has natural magical talent that allowed him to escape the elder brain's influence. When the player meets him in _Baldur's Gate III_, he works with the Society of Brilliance - an intellectual organization - and seeks to understand his hunger so that he can find alternative food sources, or at least reduce the number of brains he needs to live. He's polite, patient, and highly intelligent.

Sakie Satou, _Interviews with Monster Girls_

Sakie Satou is a succubus, which means her body produces powerful pheromones that overpower the sexual desires of anyone in her vicinity. She's horrified by this power and works hard to limit its effects on others. She lives a life of self-denial - she lives alone, avoids others while traveling to and from work, wears the most modest clothing she can find (including glasses she doesn't need), and is generally skittish around other people, especially men. Much of her storyline is about finding ways to live more comfortably than this while limiting the unintended effect of the pheromones. ",115,1767805939.0,TopCharacterTropes,22,0.98,False

I was OUT. Sore throat, fever, fatigue, body aches, you name it. The worst symptom I had was not being able to breathe properly towards the end of it which sent me into a panic. 

My bf during that time … kinda meh. Not once did he make me tea and I felt like he wasn’t taking me being sick seriously at all. He tried to get me to do my work and didn’t understand why I called out of work. He was like “well you can’t do a little”. I felt like I should feel bad for sleeping and watching tv but that’s all I could do. When I told him I can’t breathe he said “ok, well I’m sorry” and then went to the kitchen to make himself coffee. He threw a half-assed “lemme know if I should take you somewhere” over his shoulder but no real warmth or caring. When he sat on the sofa, he made me get up to fetch him water bc he “had just gotten comfy”. And so on and so on. In short - he didn’t take it seriously at all and I could tell he didn’t care about how I felt. 

Now - he’s sick. He immediately called out of work and is now sending me to get him water and tea and overall is like “well, I’m sick, take care of me please.” And maybe I’m the AH but I’m petty. I know he’s feeling bad and I know he needs help just as I needed help but I feel so petty because he literally is acting like he’s dying right now and when I was feeling like that he just brushed it off and made me feel like I was overreacting. When I said this to him earlier he asked me why the hell I would start an argument when he’s sick. Am I the Asshole here for bringing it up and making him walk around and get his own stuff when he’s sick and needs help? ",0,1767805784.0,AITAH,28,0.5,False

Couple (late 20s) looking for new friends/fellow parents.,"Hey everyone. My partner and I moved to Calgary (Killarney/Glengarry area) recently from a small town in Saskatchewan. Honestly, we’re finding the transition to the city a bit tougher than expected. Even though there are people everywhere, we’ve been feeling pretty isolated and miss having that true sense of community you get back home.

​We’re hoping to find some local friends or other parents to grab a coffee, a beer, walk our dog, or even start a game night with.


​About Me (29M):

​The Nerd Stuff: LOTR, Star Wars, D&D, and Magic the Gathering, gaming.

​Hobbies: I play guitar and sing, and I love cooking.

​Sports: Flames fan (rough year, I know) and a Saskatchewan Roughriders fan.

​Drinks: Sober right now to support my wife during her pregnancy but I love the craft beer scene.


​About My Spouse (25F):

​Interests: Total animal lover, coffee enthusiast, and a big fan of crochet and anything ""crafty.""

​Gaming: She hops on video games occasionally, too!


​The Family:

​We have a toddler and a new baby on the way, so we’re definitely in the thick of the parenting trenches right now. We also share our home with a dog and some cats.

​If you’re in the SW, have kids of a similar age, or just share some of our interests and want to help a couple of Sask transplants feel more at home, please reach out! We’d love to connect.


​TL;DR: Couple from small-town SK in Killarney/Glengarry looking for friends who like gaming, nerd culture, craft beer, or have toddlers/babies. Help us make this big city feel a little smaller!",5,1767805779.0,CalgarySocialClub,3,1.0,False

I think he could tell I was obsessed, because I don’t often get distracted by cute things and I was struggling to hold a conversation without breaking off to mention a detail I had noticed about these items behind him. I originally thought it was the work of one artist, but after looking them up (because I was hoping for patterns to attempt some of them myself), I think it’s a group of artists, so I’m not sure if these were all made by the same individual. I truly do not have the gumption or patience for micro crochet, but seeing the earrings in person gave me a whole new level of respect for those who do (looking at you support shrimp). I’m going to be on the lookout for a small round kitty pattern because I think they would be so fun to make, so if you have an idea of where to look, I’m all ears!

But now, mid 30s, I finally hit the ENFP stride and INTJs are nowhere to be found. I can understand why this is but it’s so frustrating to finally KNOW, and then poooof, you are all dug into your lives and careers and couches and don’t even go to friggin trivia nights anymore? Don’t work on laptops at coffee shops anymore. I only see early-to-mid 20s INTJs.

Also, I really don’t want to be creepy and go places *just* to meet people but I’m worried that that’s what has to be done to meet you now. 

I would love for this to happen organically of course, but how? Is it even possible now that we aren’t in college or grad school, or now that our friend groups have all fractured, or that we don’t work part time jobs anymore, or that all our favorite bands split up? Where? 

Another question; Do you still love us in our 30s?! Haha! Do you still crave the excitement and passion that you wanted from us in your 20s? Do you still find it endearing when we are doing 4 creative projects at once? Do you still love the epic passion and romance?  Do you still find us hilarious? I have just now reached my stride and I’m terrified you are over it all since you have been in yours for years and years. 

Another huge concern of mine is that most of the INTJs that want kids probably already have them by 36. So I’m kind of freaking about that too. 

Classic ENFP bs I know but no one understands us like you and that’s what I’m literally saying 

What should I do? 

Yes I know personalities are not end alls.

1q6l19n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/1q6l19n/done_with_zoloft/,Done with Zoloft,"Another generic switch.

Countless people being put on a new formula without warning or consent.

Some of us are rather affected by this.

Some of us are tired of having to call pharmacies to find a generic we know worked before you swapped our mental health out to the highest bidder.

Some of us don’t want to do it anymore.

I cry for a week, and then am put on hold for half an hour to be told my go-to generic formula had changed anyway. *There was no going back*. There was no reason to stay on the line or do the pharma shuffle *while I’m struggling because of it.*

So I said Fuck It.

I’ve been on this shitty ass generic for a couple of weeks now. Hang on, because this is where it gets interesting: After the initial crying bouts, *my brain and my body came back online.*

It caused me to realize in no uncertain terms that this medicine is making me a zombie. Food was a chore. Sex was a lot of mess with very little payoff. Talking to people? Yeah, no point. I didn’t even get out of bed of leave this room or take care of myself without a lot of convincing.

Today is the first day I have woken up in ages and felt good. I didn’t overthink, I didn’t roll around in bed like “Fuck, another day. Now what?” I leapt out of bed and turned on the lights and made breakfast and said hi to my mom before coffee.

I can feel the soles of my feet. The burger my mom made last night was *the best thing I have ever had*. Sun feels good on my skin, colors are more vibrant, I can feel my body, and I honestly had no idea what I was even missing. I knew life wasn’t supposed to be that hard, but I thought it was me.

In no uncertain terms, it’s clearly the medications that are keeping me stuck. This very slight shift in bioavailability happened to have a tremendous impact on me. They say that if you’re on an SSRI long enough, your brain doesn’t always know how to bounce back. Welp, I guess mine does!

*I cannot imagine what it will feel like to be myself again.* But I can’t wait to find out. I can’t wait to remember what it’s like to have a life. I can’t wait to know what it’s like to not be dependent on drugs, pharmacies, manufacturers, doctors, insurance companies, and the nightmare that is the American healthcare system. They know how to get us on this stuff but have no plans to get us off.

TL/DR: SSRI Zoloft generic keeps getting swapped, they stopped making my old formula, so the new generic was essentially a dosage decrease for me in terms of bioavailability. I went through minor withdrawal and came out the other side knowing this medication is actively zombifying me. I literally do not know what to do with myself. I feel so alive.

*Yes, I will be doing this under professional supervision from my prescriber. I understand the risks.*

1q6l18z,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1q6l18z/how_much_do_you_spend_on_groceries_household/,"How much do you spend on groceries, household items, and toiletries per month?","How big is your family and what’s your left over income after fixed (housing, vehicle expenses, monthly bills etc) expenses? What is your monthly budget for groceries, household items, toiletries, and anything else?

Just trying to get a baseline here since it feels like our spending is out of control. My husband and I are sitting down to make a budget this weekend because our credit cards are ballooning and we just had to take out a 401k loan to catch up on rent and make some basic car repairs. We have no savings, nothing left over, and are stuck in the paycheck to paycheck cycle. 

We are a family of 4 (husband, myself, 2 year old, 4 month old, plus a cat). We live in a very rural area so all of our shopping takes place at the nearest Walmart. Rather than breaking down separate categories, we’re lumping all these expenses together since, except the occasional Amazon order, they all happen at 1 place. Groceries, household items, toiletries, cat food, and (a big one) diapers. Most of the formula is thankfully covered by WIC, and we also get a little help there with produce, rice and beans, milk, and peanut butter. We average about 200$/week in spending, maybe a little more some weeks when we need to restock on some pantry staples. Some things I guess we *could* give up is coffee and seltzer, but these things feel like my lifeline since I am averaging about 4-5 hours of sleep a night, broken in 45-90 minute increments. As silly as it sounds, a cold seltzer in the middle of the night feels like heaven and helps me regulate enough not to get frustrated with my high-needs infant. I feel like these frivolities will be the first things on the chopping block in the eyes of my husband. 

I cook 100% of our meals at home. I absolutely love to cook, love trying out new recipes, but I feel like I do a pretty good job at shopping my pantry and making cohesive meal plans that reuse ingredients. I’m mostly a stay at home mom, working 1 day a week on the weekends when my husband is home. 

+800$/month on these expenses feels way too high. It’s our highest expense after rent. On the other hand, that includes diapers for 2 kiddos, formula when what we get from WIC runs out, 3 meals a day for myself and toddler (who mostly only eats toddler-charcuterie so it’s not *that much* food) and dinner for my husband. Along with toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, cat food, and everything else we need that isn’t a fixed monthly payment or gas. Is that just how much things cost these days? Or am I being ridiculous with my seltzer and coffee and occasional “splurge” ingredients like fresh parm or Kalamata olives? ",1,1767805616.0,povertyfinance,3,0.67,False

**Interlude 3.9C**

**Bronson's Cauldrons and The Chief's Calendars at Chapelle's (Part 3)**

\_\_\_

**Chapelle’s Emporium:**

The stately, roguishly handsome crocodile proprietor looked up as he heard the soft tinkling of chimes. A long, thin blue tendril gently pushed the door open. That tendril led back to a hovering portal whose borders were constantly sprinkling fairy dust. The glowing motes of ephemera faded from existence after a few seconds, half of them barely reaching the ground. Behind the portal, perched atop his usual plushy footrest of a throne was the owner of the still-extending tendril, now closing the door gently.

“Good morning, Chappelle!” Cecil, the adorable blue slime squeaked. His portal soundlessly hovering to the counter. Another tendril had extended over, laying onto the counter a bag of gold coins. 

“Good morning, Cecil!” The crocodile smiled, expertly opening the bag with one hand and taking out the coins, mentally tallying them as he laid them in neat stacks. “I’ve crafted twenty, instead of fifteen Duregar War Darts. I believe you’ve been told how they work?”

“They’re little darts that grow to the size of a javelin once thrown.” Cecil said, following along as Chapelle led him to his office. “In addition, they’re quite heavy.”

“In addition to the request Kvaris made, so that I don’t have Amaduscia tearing my scales off, I’m giving additional armaments..” Chapelle said as he unrolled a leather holder containing the War-Darts. 

“Thank you. I hope it wasn’t so troublesome.” Cecil remarked, taking the package after rolling it back up.

“It’ll be worth the trouble. \[Sentry Bow\]” Chapelle said, holding up a tall bow, “There’s more to it, but it allows the girls to muster this bow while they have their shields up.”

Cecil murmured appreciatively, “Definitely a good weapon, the girls do need more ranged abilities.”

“This bow assumes a spectral form once they’ve been assigned to the shields.” Chapelle explained, “So they won’t have to carry this big and heavy weapon around. The arrows are generated from their own \[Mana\] and require only the commensurate amount of strength to pull the arrow. That said, they could expend more \[Mana\] to it if they need to shoot one as powerful as a scorpion spear.”

“Thank you. I’ll pass these along.” Cecil said, his tendrils snaking out to take the proffered pair of bows and a box of what could be the magical components needed to get them to work.

“And now, the rest of your orders…”

Chapelle ducked into a neatly-ordered pile of wrapped up orders and produced the Xefilos, the orihalcum hoop was now gilded, and well-faceted soulstones now hovered in place within the sub–rings. Cecil had had a look at the Xefilos before but his beady little eyes widened in surprise as he saw that the decorative inlays were moving, as if it were liquid metal. 

“It’s like it's alive…” The slime squeaked, he poked the surface with a tendril, seeing no harm considering that the crocodile himself was touching it with no ill effects. The moving parts simply shrank away from his touch, rather than harm him like a negligently-built power tool.

“The magic to build more of these is a lost art.” Chapelle sighed, “Fortunately, the techniques to restore one to a working condition is not lost knowledge. It's a work of art if i say so myself, ensuring the warriors of this lost kingdom can still possess the means to fix them while giving nothing away to the wrong hands.”

“How thoughtful…” Cecil said, taking in the *kanabo*\-like clubs. They were roughly the size and shape of a baseball bat, but instead of a round shape, it was hexagon-like, no doubt the multiple sharp edges allowing the user to enhance the striking power, “What do these do again?”

“Tauven War Drums.” Chapelle replied, helping Cecil bring in the clubs. Not only did they look like they had been forged only today, but apart from their basic shape, they looked nothing like the clubs handed over a few days prior. Such was the masterful work of the craftsman, “Besides enhancing their appearance, the valiant former wielder of these clubs had overextended the power of these weapons. Their soulstone cores had been so drained that it had damaged the weapon from the inside as well.”

“Great work, Chapelle!” The little blue slime squeaked. His body jiggled from the potent \[Mana\] thrumming through the weapon.

“I didn’t answer your question though,” Chapelle said. “On striking an opponent, it will generate an omnidirectional blast of pure concussive force from the point of impact, well, except towards back to the wielder, which means twice the force and some. Now, this dragon lance…”

Chapelle unfurled a long package covered in patterned cloth. True to its name, it was a lance too beautiful to be used in an actual fight, except that it was. Its rondel guard resembled a dragon’s head while the rest of the lance a spiraling flame.

“Possesses unparalleled penetrating force…” 

Cecil’s body jiggled as he suppressed a tiny giggle.

“I trust that Tom Foster’s daughter has ways to muster this grand spear with unparalleled creativity.”

“I have no doubts…” Cecil replied, keeping his tone even.

“This too goes to Sammy, I believe.” Chappelle said, holding out a long, oblong mirror. Its bezels were richly engraved, and the mirror itself looked like a cross-between a traditional mirror and well-polished chrome to Cecil’s eyes. The mirror’s surface was broken up by a bold chevron bearing glowing runes, while the oblong shape of the bezel had decorative platinum wings and a pointed end, giving the item the shape of a kite shield.

“Hold on!” Squeaked Cecil, the slime rippling in confusion “Sammy’s not supposed to bear shields or she’ll lose out on her other protective abilities, right?”

The crocodile gave him a reassuring smile. “That has already been factored in, and no, this will not violate the condition of her enchanted pauldrons or Guardian Blades as it will be borne on the Xefilos. This is the \[Prism Rampart\]. The mirror, or prism part is crafted from the crystolith shells that Philia provided, honed to a mirror-like finish as you can see. Once this shield is struck, it will draw from its soulstone reservoir to simulate a spalling effect. In other words, this shall shower the assailant with a spray of sharp projectiles identical to shards of hardened crystolith shells, launched with roughly the same amount of force the shield was hit with.”

“Great work then, Chapelle!” Cecil extended tendrils to help Chapelle re-wrap the shield in cloth. “With something like this, Sammy can definitely wade into the thick of battle without fear of being overwhelmed… well, I mean, she’s already an overwhelming force herself.”

“Speaking of Ingrid…”

Chappelle handed out the Deep Dragon scale armor that Ingrid wore over limbs. It never got old to Cecil how it looked like well-textured black leather at first glance, but a closer look revealed them to be tiny scales of unimaginable toughness. It looked much shinier now, and the golden bezels looked newer, more elaborate, and crackling alive with wisps of energy. The dark purple soulstone gems looked like they were worth a million-dollar heist every professional cat burglar was legally required to steal after a confusing montage of reversals, fakeouts, and triple-crossing.

Chapelle let out a low crocodilian throat bellow as he made a self-satisfied smile.

""These soulstones are new."" Chapelle explained, ""And I've meticulously crafted them to be more accommodating to Ingrid's abilities. Furthermore, there's a practical reason as to why they all look uniform and tinted with matching colors...""

""There is?"" The slime squeaked.

The crocodile nodded.

""If an opponent can discern what kind of soulstone it is..."" he explained, ""Then in theory, an observant opponent can do something about it. By altering its shape and re-tinting its color, then it makes it much harder to tell what kind of soulstone is inlaid into the armor. This makes it much harder for enemies to discern what they do. For example, we know for a fact that these stones are there simply to help regulate and minimize Ingrid's use of the \[Ether\]."" 

Cecil hmm'd thoughtfully.

""I see what you mean..."" the slime said ""...in Ingrid's case, seeing her in her Drow Solenrala, using the Ether, would make any opponent unfamiliar with her simply assume that these soulstones are the ones responsible for what is supposedly an impossible feat.""

Chappelle nodded, making a low rumbling sound.

""Precisely."" he said, ""And now, such an opponent will waste his time trying to shatter them on the principle that if Ingrid was bereft of these stones, she would lose the ability to call on the \[Ether\]. A presumption that would prove to be fatal.""

The two of them shared a chuckle.

""And besides that..."" Chapelle continued, ""...I've also enhanced Ingrid's \[Masquerade Piece\], now she can add to her apparel as needed.""

""Why isn't everyone using it more?"" Cecil queried, ""Wouldn't it be great to have like, say... a suit of armor on standby?""

The stately crocodile shook his head slowly.

""It would be nice."" he began, ""The Rhokalian Dressform you have was originally based on a similar magic to what a Masquerade Piece uses. However, there's a vast difference between transferring all benefits of its articles onto you without wearing them and simply changing what you wear. Also, there is still a matter of range. Based on your recollections regarding your experiments. It appears that your bond with Ingrid renders distance irrelevant. For others, the Dressform must remain nearby, thankfully not as comically close as a Rhokalian Dressform.""

**Control Room, Autumnhollow House:**

The drapes were drawn, leaving the room in a warm amber glow of the ceiling mood lights. The silent hum of the air conditioner was joined with the rhythmic muted whirrs and clunks as the laser printer began printing out Neith’s latest briefing on the Other Earth’s Site Epsilon-Four, as well as a summarized transcript of Chappelle's ongoing exegesis.

These sounds as well as the quiet crinkling of the crisp paper sheets (synthesized by Zefir himself), were overpowered by another set of sounds.

A trail of Zefir and Viel's clothes, carelessly discarded, decorated a path that led from the doorway to the big plushy couch. The couple's furious lovemaking upstairs should have long put out the embers of desire, but a lack of things to do since the rest of the Whales handled  the preparations, as well as Zefir wanting to do the right thing and assure Viel that he reciprocated her feelings, had turned a casual after-sex luxury coffee into another pledge of devotion.

The citrilan boy and girl's lips were locked all the time, except when breaking for air or breathy adulations of “I love you” or a need to nuzzle the twitching ears. 

Zefir was purring in pleasure as he gently nibbled on her twitching cat-ear lobes. She felt very hot and sticky around him, especially on the backpull, as if afraid he would leave her, prompting him to be extra diligent with his thrusting into her with deliberate, slow strokes to keep her happy.

Zefir smiled, he didn't know she had harbored a crush on him. As it turns out, before Iohann and Sammy had outed him for not looking at the other girls with intentions of desire, Viel had simply assumed that he was being like any other citrilan man who found the idea of being mistaken for a ""pounding boy"" was an affront to their masculinity. 

She had seen him fawn over Ingrid and Philia, but it was to be expected, being an admirer of the two fallen heroes of his old world. Kinu and Kvaris possessed the clout of their illustrious father, and with that number reaching four, Viel had long abandoned all hopes of dalliances.

Then she learned that Zefir's earthly sensibilities rendered the concept of ""pounding boy"" moot thanks to Iohann and Sammy, who questioned his seemingly lack of interest towards the others. Especially towards Sammy, who by his own admission was attired the most alluringly of all yet never elicited any reaction from him.

By dint of application two days ago, Viel had learned that while being a ""pounding boy"" by Earth's standards would have been virtuous for any man, it was far more prudent for him to not make the first moves once he had a number going.

Viel, on her part, felt her pangs for him grow stronger after the raid on Irons. He likely was not aware that his citrilan physiology had been calling out to her, especially with all his amorous purring when around Ingrid and the Enthana sisters, and his somewhat worried and clingy attitude just before the girls sortied out had endeared himself to her. 

She sighed as he reached out and stroked the base of her tail and other ear, a gesture that affirmed to her that his feelings were genuine, and not simply some boy who was paying in kind a girl who provided gold to keep his house running. 

""I'm happy,"" Zefir said purred breathily, ""Even if I just happened to be a citrilan boy.""

""No, it's more than that."" Viel meowed between gasps, whatever she was going to say was muffled as the two kissed. Their pleasures peaked like waves crashing against a shore, and she instinctively wrapped her legs around him as he grew inside her, wrapping around him in her velvety embrace as he dutifully yielded his tribute of passion. They moaned into each other's mouths, her lips curling into a smile as she felt his climax; powerful, and copious... an undeniable proof of his ardor.

They lay together on the couch, tails entwined as they basked in the heat of their afterglow. Their ears perked up as they heard the printer go off again.

""What's printing, Neith?"" Zefir asked, absentmindedly scratching behind Viel's ears. The girl giggled and snuggled closer to him, nuzzling his chest.

""A summary of Chapelle's exegesis to Cecil."" Came the voice from the PC speakers, ""Analog fall-backs are always good to have.""

""It's nice to have such a small printing press."" Viel murmured, smiling as Zefir purred into her ear as he nuzzled her back. “We could earn extra by selling books.”

Zefir looked at her and kissed her forehead. “That’s a great idea.”

“Not the finished product of course…” Viel said quickly, “Unless we can get a bookmaker. But we can sell the pages and share in the profits of the sale.”

That caused Zefir to push himself up by the elbow on the sofa.

""Say Neith..."" he began. ""Do you know what models existed in the 90's for mass printing?"" 

The AI was quiet for a few seconds.

""I think it's better to have Arek source those for us."" Neith replied as the printer completed its task, ""Most models in the 1990s aren't really built for color reproductions. I mean, they do exist, but if you want to counterfeit missives then it's better to get something only a few decades back, without all the unnecessary bloatware.""

""Sure!"" Zefir said, ""Contact him.""

""Already ahead of you."" Neith said.

""*Yeah, I was just muted*."" Arek's voice came onto the speakers, ""*Glados just contacted me a few seconds ago. What you looking for?*""

""Printers, for mass dissemination."" Zefir said, making Viel purr, ""Preferrably crap-free, so nothing from the dark ages and from Earth, so you don't have to deal with intergalactic customs.""

The gulan made rapid clicking sounds as his mandibles worked.

""*Kaguya?*"" he said after a few moments.

""*Let's go with an American classic.*"" The alien AI suggested, ""*A Xerox 700 Digital Color Press. Released in 2007, it's capable of doing 70 pages per minute at full color, with stellar durability and toner efficiency. Its also makes any commercial chest freezer you might find in 1990 look like a kid's toy box, perfect for mass disseminating libel towards your despot of choice. All you need now is for Cecil to fly over a town and sprinkle them into the air to foment dissent among the citizens*.""

The two cats by the sofa chuckled. For Zefir, it reminded him of the clips he had seen in World War 2 and Vietnam. For Viel, she was imagining hundreds of peasants roaring in laughter over libelous accusations towards their baron, alleging he had fathered children through Philia's crystolith-based aphrodisiacs. 

Regardless of the veracity, such information would strike a loathsome blow on any noble's reputation.

""*This is a potent weapon*."" Arek mused, ""*The ability to sow discord, distrust, and chaos to a populace with words alone can't be easily discounted.*""

""That said..."" Zefir meowed, ""I guess that can wait... pulling stuff from Earth knocks out Philia and the problem of having to bring one over to your place will...""

""*Pshaw*,"" Arek scoffed. ""*Use it to make calendar girls out of the team and sell it. Sex sells*. *Make porn.*""

""*More like, a picture of me sitting on the couch and the girls are standing behind me, looking at me hungrily.*"" Zefir laughed, ""*I'm the sex symbol here, Arek. I'm the pounding boy, remember?*""

Arek, Kaguya, and Neith murmured in agreement.

""*Now that's a calendar idea!*"" Zefir said, eyes shining, ""*The dick pics of Dick Wood.*""

**Chapelle’s Emporium:**

Cecil was rolling on the floor while Neith's HTX bot rolled over.

""My apologies."" The cute little robot said to the crocodile, ""But a member of my golem swarm has confirmed we've acquired the services of a bookmaker and a little Earthly wordplay has had our little slime laughing.""

""You could print the fireside stories of your homeland for good coin."" Chapelle suggested, ""Everyone's hungry for a novel novel.""

""I can imagine a couple of tales."" Neith said, ""Ones that should require little or no explanation of our homeland's nuances. Like of a cursed ring that deceives all who come across it that it will bring them great power.""

Chapelle let out an amused throat bellow.

""Sounds like Fiendlord's bauble."" he mused. ""I can imagine all who find it in their possession to struggle with its foul influence. I like it. Do send me a copy-""

""Free of charge, as a gift."" Neith assured him. ""There is another, quite popular in our home. It had sequels too. With a few alterations to the story, it could be enjoyed by everyone. It's about a few people who have escaped their fated deaths, and Death himself decides to exact his toll by arranging an entertaining series of events...""

“Go on…” Chapelle said, leaning over his counter.

For Mia, a terrible drunk friend. Merry Christmas.

Never understood the work life balance. I am a vulgar vessel for my depraved desires. I am no different from the common animal we anthropomorphically distinguish ourselves from. I pass out when my body does. I eat when I get too hungry. I briefly masturbate viciously when I yearn for a release of sexual dopamine. I go out to my balcony in the cold morning and finish a cigarette next to the trees that wave to me. I don’t wave back.

I work because there are things I’d like to achieve, and a means to it that I must acquire. I train because to be the beast I want to be, there’s much sharpening of the senses, claws and jaws, to be done. For the machine, yet impregnable, incites my lust for destruction, for a sensual, pure violence.

I talk to whoever’s next to me when I want to socialize. The easy prey are easily amused by the way I lead conversation. I share just enough to show my calculated vulnerability, then throw the ball in their court. Then they start sharing, talking. I interrupt appropriately to reinforce or interject. It keeps the conversation alive. They see I am real. If they have reached the level of understanding they see the traces of nuance. The colors of the bricks that built this house. This big bad wolf built a brick house. They are amused by the array of profoundly human subjects she jumps from. They are intrigued by her tolerance. Seldom impressed by her knowledge, seldom curious of why somebody must have built this careful sanctuary, silently interested in why a woman of conventional looks, an easy social personality has built a character on such dense philosophy of anecdotal wisdom and theory knowledge. And then I leave. It’s important you leave. What value is your presence, if they know not the feeling of your absence.

And I go off on my own again. I stop the thoughts. Thinking doesn’t do me much good. They betray me a lot. And I’m grown now! Mature enough not to overanalyze, inflate false hopes, and rationalize away rational doubts. Last time I thought I tore my stomach open. But the ember of my heart keeps us going. Where else do I light my cigarette.

I might come back to them. It’ll always be surprising they saw even half of what I see in myself. They tell me they missed me. They tell me they value me. I leave every door open. If I heard more I might’ve felt the same way. So I leave.

I go to bed. The blanket of contradictions is warm. Very comfortable. I curl into it. The air’s cold enough to lull my senses to keep my intestines from rotting. The maggots tickle the torn flesh. I don’t think of what the next day brings or what I should do.

Because I know what I’ll end up doing tomorrow. What I’ve always done.

I’ll do.

‘Work Life Balance’ by Maria Trapp





I pick up the phone. Ugh, It’s Esme calling.

“Yes Esme, you’re interrupting my *beauty* time.”

“I need the draft.”

“I sent you a draft”

“Please just send me the draft. I can delay sending something to Geoff for another 2 days but he needs it before Thursday so he can go over it before sending it to the review board.”

“Fuck Geoff. Fuck the board.”

“You’re a *children’s novel* writer. I’d hate for your insistence to aggravate the publication inflame the relationship we have—”

“Esme my love, you get so punctual when you’re angry. Come over, I’m hot and ready for you. I miss what we shared…”

“Satty, please.”

“Out of the fire of love come ashes. Even the greatest love eventually fizzles out.”

“…”

“Fine, I sent you the draft right now.”

“Thank you. \[…\] Satty what is this. ‘Once upon a time, a king gave a feast. And there came the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Now, a soldier, who was standing guard, saw the king's daughter go by. She was the most beautiful one, and he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do when it came to the daughter of the king? Well, finally, one day, he managed to meet her, and he told her that he could no longer live without her.’ Isn’t this from Cinema Paradiso?”

“It’s your favorite movie Esme.”

“Shut the fuck up, send it. I know it’s ready.”

“Only if you flash me your pretty tits.”

“Satty.”

“Just one? Please, I only reminisce every night of it’s shade of pink, its perfect texture.”

“I wonder what the parents who love your work will make of this sexually depraved cadence”

“If only I had a tight glasses-wearing bottom to dominate. I promise I’ll put you to sleep.”

“Draft has been received. Thank you Satty.”

“I’ll see you on Friday. Wear nothing under that tight suit.”

“See you Satty.”





“And as per usual, the board adores you and your works. If only they saw past your performance as some endearing and elegant family friendly socialite that you’re a depraved and horny deviant.”

“I’m surprised you agreed to drinks. I’m flattered.”

“I just needed the breath of fresh air.”

“Esme, you have such a way with words. I’m surprised you’re not a writer yourself.”

“There was a time when I dared assume such a role… don’t fucking mock me.”

“Mock you?”

Mockingly flabbergasted, I recover a serious demeanor.

“Satty, how did you find my old draft.”

“Why’d you agree to drinks?”

“The elephant asks.”

“Ugh. Geoff told me you weren’t always an editor at this publication and I know how you speak so I looked if there were any old drafts by your name. There was of course nothing. So I thought, what would my sweet perky Esme’s pen name be. It had to be a movie reference. So I stalked your old instagram posts and found it must be something from your favorite movies and there it was. Ms. Maria Trapp’s collection of drafts.”

Looking up Esme sipped her Negroni, wincing both from the bitter drink and Satty.

“I could report this to HR.”

“That won’t do our love any good oh ‘vulgar vessel’ o’ mine.”

Finishing the drink, Esme cusps the sleeve of her beige trenchcoat.

“I’m surprised you’re not cold wearing that.”

I point at my red bodycon dress, emphasize my figure a bit.

“I’m hot-blooded. The blanket of contradiction warms me up perfectly. Besides Esme why is that you stopped writing. I thought it was quite good.”

“Did you.”

Esme replies, glancing at the bartender, pointing to her coaster.

I put out the finished cigarette on the vintage glass ash tray.

“Esme, it’s really something. It has a grunge without an apparently intended edge. It’s… honest.”

“I’d really rather not talk about my old writings.”

“I always thought it was quite intimate Esme. I like to think we all form a kind of relationship, no matter what activity we indulge in. And reading one’s work, especially one with as distinct a first person voice, you knowingly or unknowingly enter a relationship with the author. \[…\] As my editor you and I also share that intimacy don’t we?”

“Distinctions to be made, you write children’s novels, and they have characters. I don’t share relationships with the characters in your novels Satty.”

“But you do with me. There’s a reason you stay. And you know my intrusion on your conceived conventional boundaries are-”

“Are to see if I’d leave as your editor. Yes Satty I’m well aware of your games and I’d rather not leave my comfortable occupation just because my author’s a lunatic.”

I stare intently at Esme,

“That’s where I think you’re lying. You might say you need this job. But you don’t need me.”

“And that’s certainly true.”

Esme downs the rest of her drink and heads for the door.

I grab her wrist.

“You remember the first time we met?”

“Go home Satty.”

“It was here. 2 years ago in this old italian mob bar where the lights are too warm. From across the bar.”

“Satty.”

”I shot you a look and you rolled your eyes. I shot another look and you looked down. I made you nervous. Some part of me shook you.”

“You did. And what. You’re going to get this pathetic?”

“And you took my hand and took me to your apartment. We didn’t share a WORD.”

“When I woke up you were there. Wearing those siren glasses of yours, sipping your coffee in your robe. Reading the drafts that I’d been rejected by from every fucking publication. Then after I woke up again from passing out I woke up in your bed, you left for work. The drafts with comments on the night stand next to me with your number at the bottom. In that exacting and cold handwriting of yours, written in your Sangria colored pen.”

“Let go Satty.”

“I’m nobody without you. You know this. And yet you’re always out of reach.”

“And?”

“Why Esme. What the hell are we.”

“I’m an editor and you’re my author. There’s nothing else.”

“I know who you are Esmerelda. The movie posters that drape your cold and odd modern minimalist colors and antique furniture. The frost tattoos you hide beneath your corporate suit and your black nails. The way you never mention it but always go out on a limb when I’m down or out of it, late to submit. I was in the copy room when I heard you in Geoff’s office the other time, telling him how you’ve never read an author with the warm beauty that surrounds my overinsistence on love as the core theme of everything I write, how it’s not a lack of range but an insistence on how it’s most important to convey the true fuel of the human engine. And still you say nothing to me. Keep me at a distance. Use me when you want. 2 years and you’ve told me nothing.”

“What do you want Satty, my unrequited love?”

I feel Esme’s shudder from her wrist, I don’t show I notice but Esme knows.

“No. I know you love me. And you know I love you too. Why can’t you just ever say it. Make it real.”

“Because I’ve loved countless people like you Saturn. People who have the depraved elegance. Who have that rare charisma and a fiery love. Fearless, sensitive, delicate. But I know how people like you are. You act like you want me. Act like you care. Act like you see me for who I am, act like you love me. And then something goes wrong. God knows why. And you leave. You leave and never look back. When you shot me that look that night? I knew what you were. I could see your fingers fidget despite your alluring poses. The chapters that reflected in your eyes and body, the caution and boldness of your body language. So what did I do? I fucked you and used you. Now it’s your turn to leave. Quit the bullshit flirting.”

“Honesty. It’s honesty, not bullshit flirting. I don’t care about anyone else. There’s nobody like you. Do you know how many bullshit girls I’ve fucked after you rejected me following that night? Each time to remind myself why I can’t get myself to give a shit about anyone except for you.”

“Whatever it takes to get naive Esme’s love right? Fuck off Satty. I’ve given you my love. It’s your turn to leave me the fuck alone.”

Tears now blurrying my sight

“Esme please. Please. I’ve said nothing but the truth to you. And I don’t know what kind of fucked up people you’ve ran into, but you know that isn’t who I am. I’ll never leave you.”

Tears start streaming down Esme’s face. ”You will. You’ll get sick of me. My strict boundaries. The way I wear my hair, the way I talk.”

“2 years. 2 years Esme. And after all that time I can’t imagine living without you. 2 years of having everything anyone could want. But 2 years not having you. Do you know what it’s like? To have everything except for the one thing you want?”

“And that’s what it’s about isn’t it. Your selfishness to possess everything. Maybe you only say you love me because you’ll finally have proved to yourself that you, Saturn, was able to get everything you ever wanted.”

“Maybe you’re right Esmerelda. Maybe that’s what it is. Not that you are everything I’ve ever dreamt of. Just an extension of my predatory nature, not the sheer allure of your existence. Fine. Go, Esme.”

I let her hand go but she stands there. Just fucking stands there. 





It was another day on the planet Candy Saturn. A planet where a ring of cotton candy and lollipops revolves an Emerald planet of PURE GREEN GRAPE CANDY. On there lived a green lollipop, Emerald.

Emerald was the prettiest lollipop in LOLLIPOP VILLAGE.

Emerald was also the NICEST lollipop in lollipop village.

When RUBY GRANDMA lollipop of lollipop village had a CRACK, Emerald took care of her day and night.  
But not all the lollipops liked Emerald.

They wished they were as pretty and nice as Emerald. The other lollipops were really mean to Emerald.  
This made Emerald very sad.

Emerald wrote her diary every night. 

One night Emerald was taking a walk outside, sighing.

Candy Saturn asked Emerald, “Why the long candy face?”  
Emerald asked, “HOW ARE YOU TALKING”

Candy Saturn laughs loudly, “I’m CANDY SATURN. I can see a lot of things, I can hear a lot of things, SAY A LOT OF THINGS HAHA”

Emerald confessed, “Candy Saturn, the other lollipops are really mean to me. I’ve only been nice to the other lollipops.”

Candy Saturn said “Emerald, the other lollipops are mean to you because you are the prettiest and nicest lollipop.”

Emerald yelled, “IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO. I HATE CANDY.”

Candy Saturn said thoughtfully, “Emerald, do you hate me?”

Emerald said carefully, “I don’t know you Candy Saturn. Are you going to be mean to me?” Candy Saturn laughed, “HAHA, Emerald, I can SAY a lot of things. None of them MEAN” Then Emerald sat down on the green candy field. Emerald never felt bad about being sad again.

Because anytime Emerald got sad, she could take a walk outside and read her diary to Candy Saturn.

And Candy Saturn always had MUCH to say, none of them mean.

1q6kxr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbuseInterrupted/comments/1q6kxr4/dealing_with_a_compulsion_to_bingeeat_and_being/,"Dealing with a compulsion to binge-eat, and being overweight","I am still trying to figure my way out from under a lot of food-related abuse from when I was a child.

**And I am tired.**

I absolutely can NOT go into WW3 not being able to handle myself around food: we're going to be rationing (my timeline is this starts somewhere between October 2026 through October 2027, along with hyperinflation).

**So I have been trying *everything*, and reading whatever I can get my hands on.**

And I've come to the conclusion that the solution for this is multi-factor:

* For some people, they struggle with a lack of feeling 'fullness', or struggle with the feeling of hunger.  (One of my foster sisters had Prader Willies syndrome, and it was horrible to see how she never felt satisfied.  We literally had to lock the cabinets.)  For this group, psyllium husk, konjac jelly/noodles, volume-eating vegetables, probiotics to change the gut biome and therefore change signalling to the brain are going to be effective along with appetite suppressants.  

* For some people, their ADHD brain is craving the nutrients that break down into dopamine and/or support brain function.  This explains why protein is often such an effective method for weight loss: L-Tyrosine is a precursor for dopamine, plus you're getting a lot of the B vitamins and iron that help your brain function.  (And it stabilizes blood sugar, reducing nausea and intense cravings.)  Stimulants also tend to help this group.

* For some people, they're under stress and their body is trying to remediate it, and so they crave foods that are salty/sweet/fatty.  This one in particular is bad for child victims of abuse, because their body is driving them to do the things that (maladaptively) reduce cortisol in a stressful situation, and then abusive parents use that as a further excuse to abuse them.  So approaches that reduce stress are going to be particularly helpful if the binge-ing is related to stress and maladaptive emotional regulation through food.

* Or maybe they're self-soothing with food.  An attempt at self-care and self-nurturing that should have been provided by loving parents.

* For some people, they don't have a healthy relationship with food since it was a method of how their parents abused them.  So if you over- or under-eat for this reason, dealing with the psychology of food is massively important.

* For some people, sugar is straight up addictive.  Food is addictive.  They are dealing with an active addiction.  And then you have blood sugar issue which absolutely leads to cravings.

And it can be multiple of these things!

**But how about I had no idea about the role of BITTER FOODS in weight management.**

Apparently, bitter foods stimulate the release of those GLP-1s that is in the new miracle weight loss medications.  The thinking goes that it signals to the body on an evolutionary level that there is 'poison' and it signals to the brain to start eating less.  Or, more technically, ""bitter taste receptors in your gut (TAS2R) trigger GLP-1, CCK, and PYY release"".

**And I was like WAIT A MINUTE, we don't eat those foods anymore**

...at least in America.  The added sugar to everything doesn't just spike your blood sugar, it eliminates the 'bitter' flavor.  But not just that, we've engineered foods to be less bitter!  Brussels sprouts, for example, used to be an extremely bitter food.  People used to eat/make tea of dandelion leaves and other bitter-oriented weeds.  Greens are often still bitter, but most people don't eat greens like collards and mustard greens unless it is a cultural norm for them.

**And I vaguely remembered how 'bitter digestive herbs' used to be a thing**

...especially in Scandinavian countries.  And how Asian countries have bitter melon and Wasabi.

**There are many reasons why Americans are overweight now**

...but isn't it interesting how bitter coffee and cigarettes are?  And how, as we have changed our coffee drinks to be more smooth, and smoke less cigarettes, we've shifted more toward obesity?  (Yes, the food is being designed to be addictive.  Yes, the OG food pyramid was garbage.  Yes, we are more sedentary.  And, yes, cigarettes have nicotine in them, which is a stimulant, and NO, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE UP SMOKING OR NICOTINE USE.)

**Sugar is still a culprit, absolutely.**

But using it in everything may have impacted one of the significant ways our bodies self-regulates

**...and maybe I owe people who drink black coffee an apology.**

Maybe super bitter chocolate isn't utter garbage 😂

**So if you've been struggling with your weight, I think figuring out what exactly is the issue is so important.**

Because you can accomplish some excellent short-term results but they don't seem to last if you constantly have to exert sheer force of will to over-ride the natural trajectory of your biology or psychology.

**Anyway, now that I think about it, a lot of 'naturally thin' people I know do tend to nibble on these 'sharp' foods.**

I am honestly going to laugh at the meta-symbolism of humans (not in a context of abuse!) needing some of the 'bitter' to enjoy the 'sweetness'.",6,1767805412.0,AbuseInterrupted,6,1.0,False

1q6kxjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1q6kxjx/the_barbaric_reality_of_mental_health_care_in_bc/,"The Barbaric Reality of Mental Health Care in BC, Canada: A Student Therapist's Experience","On January 4, 2026, I attempted suicide. The next 24 hours were a nightmarish blur of begging for help but being dehumanized and treated like a prisoner instead. I will bear the scars of this experience for the rest of my life, and I don't just mean the ones on my wrists. I am sharing my story in hopes of publicizing what goes on behind closed doors and inciting awareness and change. I came away from the hospital, from the place that was supposed to help me, with new trauma and feeling more alone and scared than ever.

My name is Demi, I am from Vancouver, BC, and I am 25 years old. I am a student counselling therapist who is supposed to graduate this month. The irony is not lost on me that I have just dedicated the last couple years of my life to learning to help others be mentally well, and yet I couldn't help myself through my own mental heath crisis. Or could I? Because the staff at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) surely didn't. I made it through this experience in one piece thanks to my own strength and resilience, not thanks to the “help” provided to me at the hospital.

I would like to preface my story by saying that I do not take issue with any individual doctor, nurse, police officer, or security guard mentioned here. They are all merely cogs spinning around in a deeply flawed system.

I will now make an effort to recount the events of my brief stay at VGH with honesty, candor, and as much detail as possible.

It all started in the early afternoon of Sunday, January 4, 2026. I thought my relationship was ending and I could see no way forward, so I hurt myself in an attempt to take my life. I realized as soon as I started bleeding that I couldn't keep myself safe on my own, so I texted the suicide hotline, 988. There was a brief wait time, but the operator I spoke with, Lisa, was as caring and helpful as they could have been over text. They recommended that I call 911 or take myself to the emergency room, and they stayed in touch with me, listening and trying to help, until I got there.

I ended up taking a Lyft to the Access and Assessment Centre (AAC) at VGH. I had intended to go to the emergency department, like I'd been instructed, but I entered a slightly wrong address on Lyft and was dropped off closer to the AAC, and I didn't know how to get to the emergency department from there. I rang the doorbell and someone brought me a form to fill out while sitting in the waiting area. I filled in my basic identifying information, an emergency contact, and answers to a few questions about why I was there. I gave the form back and continued to wait, crying quietly the entire time.

Something like 15 minutes passed, and I was then ushered into an interview room in the AAC by a social worker named Amanda. She asked if I needed water or anything, which I appreciated, but didn't need as I had arrived less than 30 minutes ago. She then interviewed me for quite some time - I believe it was around 45 minutes. I explained why I was there, what I had done, and what had triggered me. I was asked about my medications and my physical health issues. I divulged a lot of information in this interview and was completely honest, as I was at that moment afraid of myself and desperate for help. I believe at one point I asked, “Can't you just admit me?” No, they couldn't do that or give me any idea what was about to happen to me until I talked to a doctor.

I was transferred to the emergency department for medical clearance because I had neglected to take my medications for the past couple of days, and they were concerned about how that was affecting my body because of my physical health issues. I was taken there in a wheelchair through the tunnels that run under VGH. That was probably the high point of the day for me, as it was interesting to see what was down there (there are a lot of pipes). I was accompanied by Amanda and two security guards.

Once we got to the emergency department, Amanda waited with me until I was admitted and triaged. I was then told to wait in a row of chairs in a hallway. I was given an electrocardiogram, they took some of my blood for blood work, and someone came to double check my information and outfit me with a hospital arm band. We discussed my emergency contact again, as it is my ex. This all happened pretty quickly, but I was then left to wait... and wait, and wait. I spent about five hours sitting and waiting in those chairs. Nobody checked on me or offered me food or water. Other patients came and went, other patients were offered water, juice, and sandwiches, but not me.

Around 8:00pm, I was finally seen by an emergency doctor, Dr. Innes. She asked me some questions and I explained the situation the same way I had explained it to Amanda the social worker earlier. I was completely open and honest and wanted to be helped. I still trusted that I would be helped, at that point.

Dr. Innes left, came back, and then informed me that I had been certified under the Mental Health Act and now was not allowed to leave the hospital. She said that a psychiatrist was on their way to assess me, and after that happened the certification could be ended or extended depending on how it went and how I was doing. Then she left, and I was once again alone in those chairs.

Two more hours passed, with me getting hungrier, more tired, and more discouraged by the minute. Nobody had any idea how long it would take for Psychiatry to see me. Eventually, just after 10:00pm, I got hungry and frustrated enough that I got up and walked out. Nobody tried to stop me. I ordered a Lyft and went home to eat waffles. At this point my emotions were still heightened, but I was no longer actively suicidal. All I wanted was to eat something and go to bed. I booked a phone call with my family doctor for the following day to see if he could offer any help, or at least give me an update on the referral to psychiatry that he had said he'd put in for me over a year ago.

While I was in the Lyft going home, I got two phone calls from the hospital. I did not pick up because the Lyft driver was playing loud music, so I wouldn't have been able to hear. I have social anxiety and I was not in a strong enough state of mind to ask him to turn it down.

I got home, prepared my waffles, and started to engage in activities that usually calm me down and make me feel better. I did not harm myself or do anything reckless. I only had about 45 minutes to take care of myself, though, before two armed and uniformed female police officers knocked at my door. I had been expecting someone to come after me, so I answered the door and cooperated when they wanted to take me back to the hospital. I was still holding out hope that maybe, finally, someone would offer some actual, tangible help. I was sorely wrong.

The police took me downstairs to wait outside for a ride. There seemed to be some confusion, as we were waiting, standing outside in the cold, for around 40 minutes. They told me that an ambulance was coming from New Westminister to take me back to the hospital, and I couldn't just go back with them because their vehicle had no backseat. As it turned out, the ambulance had gotten called somewhere else, so a third police officer showed up to convey me to the hospital with a vehicle that did have a backseat. I had my belongings (my phone and my backpack containing my wallet, all my forms of ID, some extra clothing, and my steam deck gaming console) confiscated for the ride. Nobody told me why.

We got to the hospital at around 11:30pm, my backpack and phone were returned to me, and I was readmitted. This time there was less than 10 minutes of waiting before I was called in to be triaged again. I explained to the triage nurse that I had left because I was hungry after waiting for a total of 8+ hours with no food or water. She of course told me that I could have asked for some, but my social anxiety would not have allowed me to do this at the best of times, let alone on the worst day of my life. Besides, I had overheard only egg or cheese sandwiches being offered – I would not have accepted these anyway as I do not eat animal products. This nurse also said that she had called me three times, but I have the call logs to prove that I was only called twice. I informed her why I didn't pick up, and said that if I had been called a third time when I was away from the loud music, I would have answered.

The nurse wanted me to change into scratchy hospital pajamas and grippy socks, despite the fact that I was already wearing pajamas and they were even the same colour as the hospital ones. I obliged, however, and changed in a bathroom with the two police officers waiting outside the door.

After I changed, I was brought back to the exact same chairs in the hallway where I had waited for six hours or so earlier. This time, though, I had the police staring at me and I only had to wait a few minutes before a psychiatrist, Dr. Cheng, showed up. We went into an interview room and I had to explain yet again how I had gotten myself into this situation. Dr. Cheng was curious about my medications, my family history, my current diagnoses of anxiety and depression, and if I thought I might meet the criteria for any other mental health diagnoses. She ultimately came to the conclusion that I would be staying overnight and would be reassessed by a different psychiatrist the next day.

When I came out of the interview room, the police officers were gone, as was my backpack, which one of them had been holding. I waited for a few more minutes and then a nurse came to usher me into the Psychiatric Emergency Assessment and Triage (PEAT) unit. When I asked about my backpack, all he would say was that it was locked up somewhere. As the door to the PEAT unit was closing behind me, he said, “Oh, and by the way, this is a locked unit.” This was the first I had heard of the fact hat I would now be locked up.

The PEAT unit is a room with six convertible bed-chair things and no curtains for privacy. It also has a small interview room, where I waited for a few minutes until another nurse came to show me which bed-chair would be mine. As I sat down, she said “Oh, and we have to take your phone.” At this, I became very distressed. Nobody had warned me that this would happen, and I was not okay with it happening because my phone is my lifeline to my long-distance fiancee, who was also going through a crisis. The nurses tried to reassure me that I could use their phone to call a local number in the morning, but this was entirely useless to me as my fiancee lives on the other side of the continent. I could not reason with them. They would not let me leave, they would not consider making an exception, I could not sleep in the hallway instead. I simply had to comply. It felt like they were trying to break my spirit.

I refused to give up my phone to the nurses (there were somehow two of them now), so they called security. In desperation, I tried to hide my phone in a crack of the bed-chair, where I was lying down under a blanket. Two security guards appeared and assisted the nurses in pulling the blanket from my curled-up body and removing the phone. I did not physically resist, I only laid there crying and begging them not to. They didn't have much trouble taking it away. After the phone was gone and they were still standing around me, I sat up, made eye contact with each of them in turn, and asked them if they were really okay with what they were doing to their fellow human. They wouldn't answer me or meet my eyes.

After this, Dr. Cheng appeared at the foot of my bed-chair. She tried to talk to me, but I was crying and dysregulated and didn't want to hear it, so I said I was leaving and ran into the bathroom, where I locked the door and curled up helplessly on the floor. I banged my head against the floor a few times out of frustration, hard enough that it left a red mark and a bruise, but nobody noticed or tried to stop me. A locked unit, a team of nurses, and they couldn't even keep me safe from the physical manifestation of the distress that they caused.

I remained on the bathroom floor, curled into the fetal position, until one of the nurses knocked, calling me, and said that someone else needed to use it. I didn't want to cause difficulty for a fellow patient, so I exited the bathroom immediately and went into the interview room, where I curled up on a chair. I was still there trying to sleep when another nurse entered, asking me if she could turn on the light. I said no, please, but she did it anyways.

She was there with two Ativan (also known as lorazepam, a benzodiazepine) pills, which I did not want, and the more times I said “no thank you,” the more insistent she became that I should take them. I was not anxious, I was angry for a valid reason, and I wanted to feel it. I didn't want something to “take the edge off and have a good sleep,” as she kept saying. Eventually it came out that Psychiatry (Dr. Cheng) wanted me to take these, and if I did not take the pills, they would call security again to hold me down while they injected me with Ativan instead.

“That's barbaric,” I told the nurse.

“I know,” she replied.

I weighed my options and decided that my top priority was avoiding being medicated into submission, so I grabbed the pills and put them in my mouth, but didn't swallow them, tucking them under my top lip so they wouldn't dissolve in my saliva. As soon as the pills were in my mouth, the nurse left me alone. I was able to spit them out almost immediately and hide them in the crack of the chair where I was sitting. A trace amount of them may have dissolved in my mouth, but it wasn't enough for me to feel any of the effects, thankfully.

The rest of the night passed slowly and relatively uneventfully. I was the only female in the PACT with five much larger male strangers, and I felt unsafe to sleep in my bed-chair because of that, although none of my fellow patients gave me any indication that they would harm me. I spent most of the night lying on the floor in the interview room so I could at least be alone. They asked me to lie down in the bed-chair several times but I refused. I think I got a couple hours of sleep there on the floor, but I was mostly awake, crying and thinking and trying to figure out a way to go home as soon as possible.

At around 4:00am I asked for a pencil and paper to write a letter to my fiancee. They gave me paper and two orange pencil crayons, which were a displeasure to write with but did the job. I felt a lot better after I wrote out some of my feelings, even though I couldn't send the letter until I regained access to a phone.

Nothing much happened until 8:00am, when breakfast was delivered – a dry slab of toast, a single-serve box of Rice Krispies, a fruit cup, and a package of decaf instant coffee. I am thankful that they were able to give me vegan food, but it was terribly unappetizing and all I could stomach was the fruit cup.

I was allowed to try and use the phone to call my ex, who I live with and had been unable to inform that I had been taken back to the hospital. I figured they would be worried sick about me and I simply wanted to let them know I was alive. However, the phone didn't work because my ex doesn't have a Vancouver number.

The shifts had changed and there was a new nurse, who informed me that I would be getting moved soon to a different bed in the emergency department. Sure enough, this happened at around 8:30am. I was escorted from the locked PACT unit to a bed in a corner of the emergency department, just out of sight of the exit. I was introduced to my new nurse, Martha.

I continued to ask for access to a phone to at least contact my ex, if not my own phone to contact my fiancee, but was denied. They kept saying that a social worker would come and help me sort it out, but nobody came.

I requested to be allowed to change into my clean underwear, the underwear I had brought with me in my backpack, but I was denied. I was told that I would have to change into hospital underwear, which looked like a scratchy diaper, so I decided I could stay in my day-old pair a little longer. I also requested a pillow because my new bed didn't have one, and pen and paper to draw or write more letters. I eventually got the pillow, but no pen or paper.

I had nothing to do with no phone, no book to read, and nothing to write or draw with, so I stood at the edge of my curtain, looking at the unit around me. Martha took issue with this and chastised me, telling me to stay in my care area and that the other patients didn't like being stared at. I asked if I could go for a walk around the unit because I was bored – no. I tried to go to the bathroom – no, that is a staff one and I would have to wait for Martha to escort me to a different one, until then I had to stay in my care area.

Eventually, in desperation, I waited until Martha was busy with another patient and tiptoed to the nurses' station to see if I couldn't just sneakily use the phone I saw there. She saw me and started to chastise me again, not allowing me to explain, and I had had enough. I turned tail and walked out of the hospital.

I could hear Martha calling my name, but I didn't look back and nobody tried to physically stop me, so I got out. Once I felt the kiss of fresh air on my face I started running and continued for about a block, until my body forced me to stop and vomit due to my poor physical health. I was wearing hospital pajamas and grippy socks with no shoes, no wallet, no money, no phone. I realized that I would have to rely on strangers' kindness if I was going to get out of this one.

I walked until I reached a hair salon that looked open and not too busy. I took a deep breath, stifled my social anxiety, and then entered and asked the couple working there if they by chance had a phone I could use, because it was kind of an emergency. They were hesitant at first, but I must have looked desperate enough that they took pity on me and sent a text to my ex for me, asking them to pick me up at the Tim Hortons across the street. The kind couple gave me $5 so I could get a coffee and even offered me a pair of slippers, as I had no shoes.

I thanked the couple profusely (I will be back there one day to get a haircut and leave a generous tip), walked to Tim Hortons, got an Iced Capp, and waited 20 minutes for my ex to pick me up. And then I was free. Free and unbroken, despite their best efforts.

Because of this experience, I have lost all my remaining trust in the medical system, especially when it comes to mental health care. What I needed was compassion and someone to help me remember the coping skills I already know. What I got instead was forcible confinement, indignity, and subhuman treatment that almost pushed me further over the edge.

I have been thoroughly traumatized. I now am filled with fear to the point of trembling whenever I hear sirens passing, because I worry they are looking for me to drag me back. I cower every time I see a police car. I wonder if I will develop post-traumatic stress disorder from this, but it's too early to say. All because I needed some help to come back to myself and keep living.

Accessing mental health care should not intensify a person's desire to die. The system is broken and we need reform. I am sharing my story in hopes that it can, at best, be a step towards change. At worst, I hope it can at least raise awareness and help others make more informed decisions about whether they should seek mental health care.

1q6kq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1q6kq0p/rosacea_and_gut_health_sibo/,Rosacea and Gut Health (SIBO),"Hi everyone,

I apologize in advance for the long post.

I've wrestled with bad rosacea (type 1) for years however and have finally gotten a grip on it. I used to lurk this sub for tips and figured I would share my experience in case it might be of use to others. In short, treating my gut health solved 95% of my rosacea.

For context, I had a compromised stomach for years after spending time in a developing country. I worked with a naturopathic doctor who helped me tremendously, but I still would have issues from time to time, and there seemed to be a loose correlation between eating inflammatory foods and skin flare ups (which if anything had been getting progressively worse).

I reached a point where I was willing to try anything to have normal skin again, and came across a few articles mentioning studies showing that rosacea patients had a higher prevalence of SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). Given my background of GI problems I figured trying an over-the-counter SIBO treatment was worth a shot. Long story short, it worked. Here is everything I did, broken up into three parts:

1. My understanding from researching online is that there are sort of two treatment options for SIBO: getting diagnosed by a doctor and prescribed an antibiotic (rifaximin), or one can take herbal remedies that are equally as effective (see 'herbal antibiotics' section: [https://centerforsibotesting.com/about-sibo/](https://centerforsibotesting.com/about-sibo/)). I opted for the herbal route and took [Candibactin BR](https://www.metagenics.com/en-us/product/candibactin-br?size=90&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23389360737&gbraid=0AAAAADSX3-eDtPrQ2gZSAYHDWUDCvW-9e&gclid=Cj0KCQiApfjKBhC0ARIsAMiR_ItoSNcCEvJiT0e5hxBmt2huFF6OySIJ43HThZG37jgNzRO6OcCxThsaAsX3EALw_wcB) and [AR](https://www.metagenics.com/en-us/product/candibactin-ar?size=60&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23389360737&gbraid=0AAAAADSX3-eDtPrQ2gZSAYHDWUDCvW-9e&gclid=Cj0KCQiApfjKBhC0ARIsAMiR_IsKEr6yoAK-x7-jFRtNWnVsMXftY6-Lsj6XCqyTbB1nHkc1Ce6R2QUaAk08EALw_wcB) (the herbal blend used in said studies). I took them for two weeks, followed by a week off, and then finished with another two weeks. Note that if you do have SIBO, the Candibactin is going to make you feel like shit for the first week or two, but it is ultimately worth it.

I also took a daily [probiotic](https://biokplus.com/products/bio-k-probiotic-capsules-daily-care-50b), an [antihistamine](https://shop.heartandsoil.co/products/histamine-immune?utm_source=shopping&utm_medium=paid-google&utm_campaign=brand_standard_shopping&utm_content=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21474195338&gbraid=0AAAAABjDv9kzJ9CJIbBxWr1-0JrWVqG_x&gclid=Cj0KCQiApfjKBhC0ARIsAMiR_Itp2RYjOiM-LCph__2O1Rkp9uDAtsmhEuZIPt_FTnO6TUsHUl0fxCAaAnIKEALw_wcB), as well as an [anti-inflammatory supplement](https://www.orthomolecularproducts.com/product/inflammacore-vanilla-chai?VariantSku=671001) that my previous naturopathic doctor introduced me to for additional gut support. I continue to take all three of these as I believe they help keep my gut healthy and in turn rosacea at bay.

2) I also made significant changes to my diet, and believe it was crucial to enact these changes in tandem with the Candibactin protocol. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have seen results. I basically followed a strict paleo and low fodmap diet; I eliminated all grains/gluten (rice, bread, pasta, etc.), dairy, processed sugar, and alcohol. I think eliminating coffee would probably be a good idea as well, although I was able to get away with drinking small amounts of cold brew.

First, a huge thanks to those who used ""*Buy Me a Coffee*"" on [https://www.readme.club/](https://www.readme.club/)  
It fully covered the hosting costs for January and gave me the peace of mind to focus on fixing the issues.

To be honest, the last 48h have been a steep learning curve. As a designer, I realized the way I built the site initially was far from optimized for this kind of traffic. It's something that should have been done from the start, but better late than never!

I’ve refactored the site to be **100% static** *(well, almost 100%)*:

* No more API calls to the database on public pages (everything is pre-rendered).
* Wallpapers are now optimized (thumbnails, grayscale JPEGs, and WebP previews) to save bandwidth.
* Sorting and filtering now happen client-side.
* The build process is now batched to avoid unnecessary server costs.

My goal with these changes is to make the Hub self-sustaining so I can keep maintaining it without it becoming a burden.

More importantly, I want this to stay a community effort where everyone can focus on what they do best: **developing amazing open-source firmwares, designing 3D-printed covers, sharing great wallpapers,** and all the other things that make this Xteink community so cool to follow.

The site is much lighter now, and hopefully, we're set for the long run. Thanks again for the help and the reality check!

P.S. A special shoutout to:

u/_Ritual for the ""*reality check*"" and the direct advice (Static Site Generator / Stop the PDFs). It was the wake-up call I needed to fix the architecture!.

u/Competitive-Win4945 for the constant support ✌️

u/devonsbradley for the ""think outside the box"" DM-session.

u/plinkobyte for the suggestion on wallpaper optimization. Creating lightweight JPEGs instead of full BMPs for thumbnails was a massive headache to implement in 48h, but the site is now incredibly faster because of it.

I am planning to have my friends and I handle the bulk of the move, including boxes and most furniture.

  
There are a couple of items that I would like to hire professional help for. Specifically a large solid wood dresser (would remove/move drawers beforehand,) and most importantly, 2 tables with removable glass tops that I really do not want to get broken. (A circular dining room table that seats \~4 with a solid/heavy base, and a rectangular oval coffee table with a metal base)

I've been doing research and I'm having trouble finding services that would fit what I'm looking for and would not be the price of a full service move of a full apartment. For fragile items, it looks like most professional movers prefer using their own truck/equipment instead of using something like a UHaul I could rent, which may be affecting the pricing I'm seeing. I know there are services like taskrabbit/dolly/lugg, but are these services actually prepared to handle fragile items?

1q6kmi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q6kmi6/ro_the_symmetry_of_love/,[RO] The Symmetry of Love,"Title: The Symmetry of Love

Part I: The Blood and the Memory
The ""Emergency"" sign at the hospital was a mocking, neon red, casting a bloody hue over Vicky’s hands. His shirt was ruined—soaked with the lifeblood of the girl who was his entire world.
""Listen to me, Diya,"" he had whispered in the ambulance just minutes before, his voice cracking. ""You can’t leave me. We’re symmetrical, remember? You can't have one side without the other.""
She had smiled through the pain, a faint dimple dancing on her cheek despite the blood. ""Stupid,"" she’d breathed, ""I’m never leaving you.""
As Vicky slumped into a plastic chair, his head against the cold hospital wall, the silence of the corridor triggered a flood of memories. He and Diya had been ""Vicky-and-Diya"" since they were five years old in Hadapsar(India). He remembered her exactly as the word 'Symmetrical'—long, glossy hair, gleaming white teeth, and a beauty she seemed entirely incognisant of. She had been his anchor when his father died in ninth grade, the only person who could pull him out of the darkness of grief.

Part II: The Night the World Changed
The spark had truly ignited just months ago, during their final biology exams. Vicky, an average student who knew the textbook by heart thanks to his mother’s encyclopedias, had used a ""study session"" as a pretext to spend time with her.
""I don't understand Human Respiration,"" he had lied, looking at her with his straightest face.
Diya had burst into laughter, her eyes partly closing, her teeth looking like a toothpaste advertisement. ""Don’t you breathe? I hope you’re joking!""
I breathe for you, he had thought, but the fear of rejection kept the words locked in his chest. That night at 2:00 AM, the air in his room turned electric. Diya had spilled coffee on her new birthday top and changed into one of Vicky’s ironed white shirts. In that oversized shirt, she looked like a goddess—a ""voluptuous, Junoesque woman"" who held him under a spell.
When the clock hit 5:00 AM, Vicky finally found his guts. He held her hand near his heart. ""When you are around, I feel safe. I feel like my life’s complete. I love you, Diya.""
He expected a ""no."" He expected the end of their friendship. Instead, she wiped his tears and called him a ""cry baby.""
""You really thought I would reject you?"" she whispered. She grabbed his face, her lips tasting of sweet coffee, and in that moment, the childhood friends became soulmates.

Part III: Shadows in the Hallway
College brought new light, but also deep shadows. They were the ""it"" couple, even as they tried to hide it. Vicky would hold her hand in a classroom of seventy students, giving her ""heebie-jeebies"" but making her feel protected.
But Tanishka, Vicky’s ex-girlfriend, was watching. She was mean, possessive, and stung by how easily Vicky had found happiness elsewhere. When the Principal announced a couple’s dance for the college party, Tanishka’s jealousy turned into something darker.
Then there was Sakshi.
Vicky’s best friend, Shams—a guy with a physique like Hrithik Roshan and a smoking habit he couldn't quit—had introduced them. Sakshi wasn't just a girl; she was a mystery wrapped in a BMW 740i. She told Vicky a tragic story of a lost love in Delhi and a broken heart, but the reality was far more complex.
""You’re such a cutie, Vicky,"" she had said, kissing his cheek after a drive.
Sakshi was India’s 7th richest woman, a billionaire who lived in Dubai and owned the world, yet possessed nothing. She became addicted to Vicky’s kindness, seeing in him a purity that her millions couldn't buy. While Vicky remained loyal to Diya, Sakshi began to weave a web, using her connections to watch him, her obsession growing alongside Tanishka’s bitterness.

Part IV: The Midnight Kulfi
A week before the accident, Diya had snuck Vicky out at 3:00 AM. They rode her Activa through the sleeping streets of Hadapsar to Bhosale Garden. The air was cool, and the world was painted in the orange and red hues of a rising sun.
They sat on a stone ledge, playing a game of ""who eats the kulfi first."" Between bites of malai kulfi and passionate kisses, Diya spoke the words that would haunt Vicky forever.
""We are two lost, wandering hearts, Vicky. We are two halves craving to be together as one. We are love. We are Symmetry.""
Vicky had fallen asleep on her lap, feeling invincible. He didn't know that Tanishka was already meeting with Sakshi’s contacts. He didn't know that a ""scare"" had been planned for the night of the college party—a way to drive a wedge between him and Diya.

Part V: The Crash and the Bargain
The party was a triumph until the walk home. The screech of tires on the hilltop was the last thing Vicky remembered clearly. A car, hired to frighten them, had veered out of control. Diya, seeing the danger, had pushed Vicky out of the way. The ""symmetrical"" girl was shattered by two tons of steel.
Back in the present, the doctor emerged from the surgery room with a grim expression. ""She needs a specific neuro-stent, Vicky. It’s rare. We can’t get it here for three days. She won’t last that long.""
""I have it.""
Sakshi stood at the end of the hall. She looked grey, her blue-ombre hair messy, her eyes red from her own private breakdown in the parking lot. She walked toward Vicky, the cold businesswoman replacing the sobbing girl.
""I have a private jet at the airport,"" Sakshi said. ""My team in Dubai has the stent. I will save her, Vicky. But there is a price. You come to Dubai with me. One year. No contact. You belong to me.""
Vicky didn't hesitate. He looked at the glass partition where Diya lay, a collection of tubes and monitors. ""Save her,"" he whispered. ""And I’m yours.""
The next six hours were a race against death funded by billions. The stent arrived, the surgery was a miracle, and Diya’s vitals stabilized. Vicky stood by her bed one last time, kissing her forehead as she slept.
""I have to go, Shona,"" he lied to her sleeping form. ""An internship. For my mom’s cafe business."" He left before she could wake up and see the lie in his eyes.

Part VI: The Flight to Freedom
At the airport, Sakshi stood by her private jet, watching Vicky. He looked like a ghost. The spark she had fallen in love with was gone, extinguished by the bargain he had made.
She looked at the contract in her hand, then at the man who had become a prisoner. She remembered her own reflection in the car window—the realization that Vicky would never love her, only fear her.
""You know,"" Sakshi said, tearing the paper into pieces. ""I thought if I had enough power, I could force the world to give me what I wanted. But looking at you... I’ve already killed the thing I loved.""
She pushed him toward the terminal exit. ""Go back to her, Vicky. I can't be a billionaire if I'm bankrupt inside. Tanishka is in custody. I’ve handled everything. Just... go.""
Vicky didn't wait. He ran.

Epilogue: One Year Later
The sun was rising over Bhosale Garden, the sky a familiar tapestry of red and gold. Vicky sat on the stone ledge, two malai kulfis in his hand. He heard the uneven rhythm of a cane hitting the pavement—a sound of survival.
Diya sat beside him, her movements a bit slower now, a faint scar tracing her hairline, but her dimple was exactly where it was supposed to be.
""You’re late,"" Vicky teased, handing her the kulfi.
""Recovery is a process, Vicky,"" she said, leaning her head on his shoulder. ""And don't think I’ve forgotten that you almost 'interned' in Dubai.""
Vicky looked at her, then at the horizon. Shams was married to Shraddha now, a gym-obsessed businessman who had finally quit smoking. Sakshi had disappeared into the Himalayas, sending a gold compass every few months to remind them she was still finding her way.
""I’m never leaving again,"" Vicky said, the words a vow.
He rested his head on her lap, and she played with his hair, her fingers soft and delicate. The hospital, the blood, and the golden cage were gone. There was only the sun, the kulfi, and the perfect symmetry of two hearts that refused to break.",2,1767804742.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

I’m beyond excited (and honestly, a bit exhausted) to share that I’ve finally hit the ""publish"" button on Amazon for my very first book, ""2047: The White Room""  by John Greater.

It’s been a long journey of writing, rewriting, and late-night coffee sessions. The story is a Science Fiction novel set in two different eras: Vienna in 2047 and 2025.

If you like Sci-Fi that doesn't take itself *too* seriously, this might be for you. I tried to pack it with a healthy dose of sarcasm and lightheartedness, even when things get weird. It’s less ""grimdark future"" and more of a satirical look at how things might turn out for us.

I’ll be in Stockholm from 8–11 January and was hoping to tap into the hive mind here. I’m looking for cafés — places that take coffee seriously rather than just being “nice third-wave spots”.

I’m particularly interested in:
	•	High-quality espresso and filter
	•	Strong focus on roast quality, dialing-in, and consistency
	•	Interesting roasters (local or international)
	•	Cafés that are worth going out of the way for, not just convenient

If there are any Stockholm institutions, low-key barista favourites, or places known for excellent V60 / batch brew / espresso profiling, I’d love to hear about them.
Also very open to roaster recommendations if they have a café attached.

Salem NH real estate has always been desirable due to its location on the Massachusetts border, but Tuscan Village has taken Salem to an entirely new level and has reshaped how people view the town.

Tuscan Village has brought a true live, work, and play lifestyle to Salem NH. The development features high end apartments, restaurants, shopping, fitness studios, office space, and community events all in one centralized location. This has not only made Salem more attractive to residents, but has also increased demand for homes for sale in Salem NH as buyers look to live close to the energy and convenience Tuscan Village offers.

One of the biggest impacts Tuscan Village has had on Salem NH real estate is increased property demand and long term value. Large scale developments like this tend to elevate surrounding neighborhoods by bringing in new businesses, jobs, and infrastructure improvements. Buyers looking to purchase a home in Salem NH are often drawn to the town because they see the continued investment and growth happening right in front of them.

Another reason Tuscan Village has been so impactful is the lifestyle it brings to the area. Residents of Salem NH now have access to walkable dining, coffee shops, entertainment, and seasonal events that were previously not available locally. This has helped attract young professionals, families, and downsizers alike, all of whom contribute to a stronger and more competitive housing market.

Salem NH remains an ideal commuter town as well. With quick access to Interstate 93, residents can easily commute to Boston, Manchester NH, and surrounding employment hubs while still enjoying everything Tuscan Village and the greater Salem area have to offer. This combination of accessibility and amenities is a major reason buyers continue moving to Salem NH.

In addition to lifestyle and convenience, Salem NH real estate continues to benefit from New Hampshire’s tax advantages. No state income tax and no sales tax make buying a home in Salem NH especially attractive for buyers relocating from Massachusetts who want financial relief without sacrificing proximity to work and entertainment.

Salem NH also offers a wide range of housing options, from condos and townhomes to single family homes and newer construction. This variety allows buyers at different stages of life to enter the market while benefiting from the town’s continued growth and development.

Overall, Tuscan Village has played a major role in elevating Salem NH into one of the most desirable towns in southern New Hampshire. Between strong property values, ongoing development, commuter access, and an upgraded lifestyle offering, buying a home in Salem NH continues to make sense for many buyers looking long term.

1q6ketm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q6ketm/is_cloud_gaming_safe/,Is Cloud Gaming Safe?,"Your internet service provider already watches everything you do online. Add cloud gaming to the mix, and you're streaming hours of gameplay data—complete with login credentials, payment info, and behavioral patterns—to remote servers you've never seen. So is cloud gaming safe?

The short answer: mostly yes, but with important caveats. Major platforms use solid encryption and security measures, but they can't protect you from phishing scams, weak passwords, or your own security habits. And unlike traditional gaming where the data stays on your console, cloud gaming puts all your info in someone else's hands.

✅ **Quick Answer:** Cloud gaming from reputable platforms like **GeForce Now**, **Xbox Cloud Gaming**, and **PlayStation Now** is generally secure. These services use TLS 1.3 encryption, fraud detection, and regular security updates. However, you're still vulnerable to account theft, phishing, and data breaches—risks that exist with any online service. Using strong passwords, enabling 2FA, and connecting through a VPN on public networks dramatically improves your security.

# How Cloud Gaming Works (And Where Security Fits In)

Before we talk about safety, you need to understand what's actually happening when you play in the cloud.

Traditional gaming runs everything locally—the game files, your saves, the processing. Cloud gaming flips this. **The game runs on a remote server**, potentially thousands of miles away. That server renders every frame, processes your inputs, and streams the video back to you in real-time. Think of it like controlling a YouTube live stream.

Here's the data flow:

1. You press a button on your controller
2. That input gets encrypted and sent to the remote server
3. The server updates the game state
4. It renders the new frame
5. That frame gets compressed and streamed back to you as video
6. All of this happens in under 50 milliseconds (if it's working well)

**Every step in this chain is a potential security point.** Your login credentials travel over the internet. Your payment info lives on their servers. Your gameplay patterns get logged. If any part of this pipeline isn't properly secured, you're exposed.

Major platforms handle this with **AES-256 encryption** (the same standard banks use) and **TLS 1.3 protocols** for data transmission. But encryption only protects data in transit—it doesn't stop you from accidentally giving your password to a phishing site or protect against server-side breaches.

# The Real Security Risks in Cloud Gaming

Let's be honest about what can actually go wrong. I tested GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and PlayStation Now extensively, and here's what you're up against.

# Data Collection and Privacy

Cloud gaming platforms collect a *lot* of information:

* **Email addresses and payment details** (obviously)
* **Your physical location** (for server routing and content restrictions)
* **Gameplay patterns** (what you play, when, for how long)
* **Device information** (your hardware specs, OS version, network details)
* **Usage analytics** (menu interactions, feature usage, session duration)

This isn't unique to cloud gaming—Steam, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live all do the same. But when you're streaming games, the platform sees *everything*. They know exactly which missions you replay, which difficulty settings you prefer, and when you rage-quit.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Always read the privacy policy before signing up. Look for phrases like ""share with third-party partners"" or ""use for marketing purposes."" Most platforms let you opt out of non-essential data sharing—buried somewhere in the settings menu.

# Account Security Threats

Your gaming account isn't just about saved games anymore. It's connected to:

* Payment methods (credit cards, PayPal)
* Personal identity info (if you've done age verification)
* Social connections (friends lists, chat history)
* Purchased content (games, DLC, in-game items)

**Credential stuffing** is the biggest threat. Hackers don't hack—they use leaked passwords from other breaches. If you used the same password on that random forum that got breached in 2019, attackers will try it on your gaming accounts. And if it works? They're in.

I learned this the hard way. I reused an old password across services (stupid, I know), and one night got an email about ""unusual login activity"" on my cloud gaming account. Someone in Russia was trying to access it. Thank god for 2FA—more on that later.

⚠️ **Warning:** Over **220 million gaming credentials** were exposed in data breaches during 2023 alone. If you're not using a password manager, you're gambling with your account security.

# Network Vulnerabilities

When you're streaming games, you're sending constant traffic between your device and the server. This creates three main risks:

**Man-in-the-middle attacks:** On unsecured networks (coffee shops, airports, public WiFi), attackers can potentially intercept your data. Modern encryption makes this difficult, but not impossible—especially on older, poorly-configured networks.

**DDoS attacks:** If someone really wants to ruin your gaming session, they can flood your connection with fake traffic. This is more common in competitive gaming, where angry opponents target specific players. Cloud gaming offers some protection here because attackers target *your* IP, not the game server.

**ISP throttling:** Your internet provider can see you're using massive bandwidth and might slow your connection during peak hours. Not exactly a ""security"" risk, but it affects your experience.

|Network Risk|Impact|How to Mitigate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Unsecured WiFi|Login credentials exposed|Use VPN on public networks|
|DDoS attacks|Connection drops, lag spikes|VPN hides your real IP|
|ISP throttling|Slower speeds, buffering|VPN prevents traffic inspection|
|Malware on local device|Keyloggers, session hijacking|Keep OS and antivirus updated|

# Platform-Specific Risks

Not all cloud gaming services are created equal. Smaller, unknown platforms often cut corners on security to save money. They might use **outdated TLS versions**, skip **mandatory security audits**, or have **unclear data storage policies** (""your data may be stored in various countries""—yeah, that's not reassuring).

Free cloud gaming services are the worst offenders. They need to make money somehow, and if you're not paying for the product, your data *is* the product. Free platforms often:

* Inject ads (some of which can contain malware)
* Sell your behavioral data to marketers
* Use weaker encryption to reduce server costs
* Lack proper security audits

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Stick with established names. GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation Now, and Amazon Luna all have reputations to protect and security teams to maintain. Random free streaming sites? Not so much.

# How Major Platforms Protect You

The big players take security seriously—they have to, or they'd face massive lawsuits and lose customer trust. Here's how they compare:

|Platform|Encryption|2FA Support|Security Audits|Data Storage|Notable Features|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**GeForce Now**|AES-256, TLS 1.3|✅ Yes (via linked accounts)|Regular third-party audits|Minimal data retention|Speed testing tools built-in 🏆|
|**Xbox Cloud Gaming**|AES-256, TLS 1.3|✅ Yes (Microsoft account)|Microsoft security standards|Global data centers|Integration with Xbox ecosystem|
|**PlayStation Now**|AES-256, TLS 1.3|✅ Yes (PSN account)|Sony security protocols|Regional compliance|Game downloads for offline play|
|**Amazon Luna**|AES-256, TLS 1.3|✅ Yes (Amazon account)|AWS security infrastructure|Amazon's global network|Channel-based subscriptions 🏆|

All four use **server-side anti-cheat**, **fraud detection systems**, and **regular security patches**. They also implement **rate limiting** on login attempts (so brute-force attacks fail) and **IP reputation tracking** (flagging connections from known malicious sources).

But here's the thing: **platform security only goes so far**. If you click a phishing link, use ""password123,"" or ignore security alerts, even the best encryption can't save you.

# The VPN Question: Help or Hindrance?

Should you use a VPN with cloud gaming? The answer depends on what you're trying to protect.

**When a VPN helps:**

* **Public networks:** Airport WiFi, coffee shops, hotel connections—these are prime targets for attackers. A VPN encrypts your traffic end-to-end, so even if someone's snooping on the network, they can't read your data.
* **DDoS protection:** If you're playing competitive games and someone wants to kick you offline, a VPN hides your real IP address. They can't attack what they can't see.
* **ISP throttling:** Some providers slow down gaming traffic during peak hours. A VPN prevents them from inspecting your traffic to identify it as gaming.

**When a VPN might hurt:**

* **Added latency:** Every VPN adds a hop in your connection. For cloud gaming, where you're already fighting latency, this extra 5-20ms can make fast-paced games feel sluggish.
* **Platform restrictions:** Some games and services ban VPN usage (Call of Duty: Warzone, for example). Getting caught can result in account suspension.
* **Free VPNs are disasters:** Free VPN services often sell your browsing data, inject ads, or have terrible speeds. You're better off with no VPN than a sketchy free one.

🔒 **Security Note:** If you're going to use a VPN with cloud gaming, pick one optimized for low latency. **NordVPN's NordLynx protocol** (based on WireGuard) adds only 3-5ms of latency in testing—barely noticeable during gameplay. Standard OpenVPN connections can add 20-50ms, which *will* affect your experience.

The best approach? **Use a VPN on public networks only.** At home on your trusted network, you probably don't need one. But traveling? Hotel WiFi? Absolutely turn it on.

# 7 Practical Steps to Stay Safe While Cloud Gaming

Forget the corporate security advice that sounds like it came from a 2010 IT manual. Here's what actually works.

# 1. Use Unique Passwords (Seriously)

I don't care if you have to write them down. **Every account needs a different password.** The easiest way to manage this is a password manager like **Bitwarden** (free and open-source) or **1Password**.

Never reuse passwords across services. If one site gets breached (and they will), hackers immediately try those credentials everywhere else.

# 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

This is non-negotiable. **2FA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks**. Even if someone has your password, they can't log in without the second factor.

Use an authenticator app like **Authy** or **Google Authenticator**, not SMS. SMS-based 2FA can be bypassed through SIM swapping attacks. App-based 2FA is far more secure.

# 3. Don't Click That Link

Phishing is the number one way accounts get compromised. If you get an email claiming your account needs verification, billing failed, or you won a free game—don't click anything. Open a new browser window and manually type in the platform's URL.

Real platforms will show account issues when you log in directly. They won't email you urgent demands with suspicious links.

# 4. Keep Everything Updated

I know, it's annoying. But security patches exist for a reason. When Windows, macOS, or your cloud gaming app prompts an update, install it. Those updates often fix exploits that hackers already know about.

Turn on automatic updates where possible. Your future self will thank you.

# 5. Check Your Devices Regularly

Every few months, review which devices are authorized on your accounts. Most platforms let you see ""Active Sessions"" or ""Devices."" If you see something unfamiliar—a Windows PC when you only use Mac, or a location you've never been—kill that session immediately and change your password.

# 6. Limit Payment Methods

Consider using **virtual credit cards** for subscriptions. Services like **Privacy.com** (US) or **Revolut** (Europe) let you create single-use or merchant-locked cards. If a platform gets breached, the attackers can't use that card anywhere else.

Alternatively, buy subscription codes from authorized retailers and redeem them manually. No stored payment method = nothing to steal.

# 7. Know When to Use a VPN

VPN on:

* Any public WiFi network
* When accessing your account from a new location
* If you're experiencing suspicious connection issues

VPN off:

* Your home network (unless you have specific privacy concerns)
* Competitive games with strict anti-VPN policies
* When latency is already borderline

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Many VPN providers offer bundle deals with their paid services. NordVPN's annual plan drops to around $3/month, and you can use it across 10 devices. That's cheaper than buying separate security tools.

# What About Free vs. Paid Services?

Free cloud gaming platforms exist (GeForce Now has a free tier, for example), but there's a security hierarchy you should understand.

**Paid tiers from established platforms** (GeForce Now Priority, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate): These have strong security because your subscription pays for proper server infrastructure, security audits, and 24/7 monitoring. You're the customer, not the product.

**Free tiers from established platforms** (GeForce Now Free): Same security standards as paid tiers, but with usage limits. Your data isn't being sold—the free tier exists as a trial to convert you to paid.

**Unknown free platforms**: Avoid these. If you've never heard of the service and it's offering free cloud gaming, ask yourself how they're making money. Spoiler: it's probably your data.

|Service Type|Security Level|Risk Factor|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Paid (GeForce Now, Xbox)|High|Low|Serious gamers wanting best security|
|Free tier (established)|High|Low|Trying before buying|
|Unknown free services|Unknown/Low|Very High|Nobody—stay away|

# Platform Terms of Service: The Fine Print That Matters

Before you sign up for any cloud gaming service, spend five minutes reading the sections on:

* **Data collection and usage** (what they collect, how they use it)
* **Third-party sharing** (who else gets your data)
* **Account termination policies** (what gets you banned)
* **VPN usage policies** (some platforms explicitly forbid it)

Most people skip this. Don't be most people.

GeForce Now, for example, clearly states they collect gameplay data for ""service improvement"" but don't sell it to advertisers. Xbox Cloud Gaming integrates with Microsoft's broader privacy policy, which *does* include some data sharing with partners (though you can opt out).

🔥 **Hot Take:** If a platform's privacy policy is deliberately vague or uses phrases like ""may share with partners for various purposes,"" that's a red flag. Reputable services are transparent about data handling.

# What If Your Account Gets Hacked?

Despite your best efforts, breaches happen. If you notice:

* Unusual login activity emails
* Friends receiving messages you didn't send
* Charges you didn't authorize
* Changed password or email

Act fast:

1. **Immediately change your password** (from a device you trust)
2. **Enable or reset 2FA**
3. **Contact platform support** through official channels
4. **Check linked payment methods** for unauthorized charges
5. **Review ""Active Sessions""** and kill everything
6. **Change passwords on other accounts** that used the same credentials

Most platforms will restore your account if you catch it quickly. But if you waited weeks? You might be out of luck.

# The Future of Cloud Gaming Security

Cloud gaming platforms are investing heavily in security as the industry grows. We're seeing:

* **Hardware-based authentication** (using device TPM chips)
* **AI-driven fraud detection** (spotting unusual behavior patterns)
* **Zero-knowledge encryption** (where platforms can't read your data even if they wanted to)
* **Behavioral biometrics** (analyzing how you play to detect account takeovers)

But as security improves, so do attacks. Phishing becomes more sophisticated. Social engineering gets trickier. The arms race continues.

Your best defense isn't waiting for perfect platform security—it's **taking control of what you can**: strong passwords, 2FA, careful link-clicking, and smart VPN usage.

# FAQ: Your Cloud Gaming Security Questions Answered

**Is cloud gaming safer than downloading games?** Different risks, not necessarily safer or less safe. Downloaded games can contain malware if you're not careful about sources. Cloud gaming puts your data on remote servers, but with proper platform security, both approaches are reasonably safe. Cloud gaming eliminates the risk of malicious game files, but increases data exposure.

**Can my ISP see what games I'm playing in the cloud?** Without a VPN, yes. They can see you're connecting to GeForce Now servers and can identify gaming traffic patterns. They can't see specific in-game actions (that's encrypted), but they know you're gaming. A VPN hides even this information.

**Do I need antivirus software if I'm only cloud gaming?** Yes. While the game runs on remote servers, your local device still handles login credentials, payment info, and app sessions. Malware on your device can steal this data regardless of where the game runs.

**What's the safest cloud gaming platform?** All major platforms (GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation Now, Amazon Luna) offer strong security. GeForce Now edges ahead slightly with built-in network testing tools and transparent security practices. But honestly, your own security habits matter more than the platform choice.

**Can I get banned for using a VPN?** It depends on the game, not the platform. Cloud gaming platforms generally allow VPNs. Individual games (like Call of Duty: Warzone) may have anti-VPN policies. Always check the specific game's terms of service.

**How much personal data do cloud gaming platforms actually collect?** All platforms collect: email, payment info, location data, device details, and gameplay analytics. Some (like Xbox) share this with marketing partners by default, but you can opt out. GeForce Now collects less than most, focusing only on what's needed for service operation.

# Final Verdict: Is Cloud Gaming Safe Enough?

Cloud gaming from reputable platforms is safe *enough* for most people. Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, and Amazon all use industry-standard encryption, regular security audits, and fraud detection systems. Your data is as secure as it is on Netflix, Steam, or any other online service.

But safe *enough* isn't the same as perfectly secure. **You're the weakest link in the security chain.** Use unique passwords. Enable 2FA. Don't click suspicious links. And for the love of all that's holy, use a VPN on public networks.

The biggest risk isn't that GeForce Now will get hacked—it's that you'll accidentally give your credentials to a phishing site or reuse that password from 2015 that's already in a leaked database.

💰 **Worth the Risk?** If you're already comfortable with online banking, shopping, and streaming, cloud gaming isn't riskier. In fact, since you're not downloading game files from questionable sources, it might actually be *safer* than traditional PC gaming if you're not tech-savvy.

Play smart. Stay secure. And maybe invest in that password manager you've been putting off.

I’m about 6 months into this role and performing well. The pay is solid, WLB is good, and the job itself is fine.

The issue is that I recently relocated to a new state and working fully remote has become pretty isolating. I have a school-aged kid, so once the workday ends there’s only a small window to leave the house before evening routines. Being home all day, every day, with no in-person coworkers or new experiences is starting to wear on me, and the work is beginning to feel repetitive.

I’m considering moving into a hybrid role (not fully in-office), but I’m hesitant. Remote work is so heavily glorified that I’m worried I don’t fully appreciate how good I have it and might regret giving it up. I also don’t want to look like a job hopper this early in my career.

For context: I’m phone-heavy all day, so working from coffee shops/libraries isn’t realistic, and coworking spaces aren’t in the budget right now.

For those who’ve been in sales longer:
	•	Is this just a phase I should push through early in my career?
	•	Or is it reasonable to prioritize in-person exposure/networking now, even if it means giving up full remote?

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think—Here’s How to Unlock Your Hidden Wealth**

Ever feel like your savings are just… sitting there? Like a forgotten gym membership, collecting dust instead of gains? What if I told you that *right now*, your money could be working harder for you—without you lifting a finger?

Here’s the truth: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They see their bank balance and think, *""Eh, not bad… but not enough.""* Meanwhile, their savings are quietly losing value to inflation, missing out on compound growth, and basically taking a nap instead of hustling.

### **3 Signs Your Money Is Sleeping on the Job**
1. **Your savings account pays 0.01% interest.** (Congrats, your $10k earned *$1 this year*. 🎉)
2. **You’ve never calculated how much your savings *could* grow.** (Spoiler: It’s probably way more than you think.)
3. **You assume ""investing"" means gambling on meme stocks.** (Nope—smart growth is boring, steady, and *way* more powerful.)

### **The Wake-Up Call**
Let’s do a quick reality check. If you stashed **$500/month** in a high-growth account (like, say, a well-managed retirement fund), here’s what could happen:
- **In 10 years:** ~$85k (assuming 7% annual return)
- **In 20 years:** ~$250k
- **In 30 years:** ~$600k

*That’s not luck—that’s math.* And the best part? You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius to make it happen.

### **Your Move**
The biggest mistake? **Waiting.** Time is your money’s best friend (or worst enemy, if you let it slip away). So ask yourself:
- *What’s one small step I can take today to put my savings to work?*
- *If I did nothing for the next decade, where would my money be?*

Success","Alright Reddit, let me tell you about a time I almost threw my laptop out the window. When I first dipped my toes into the glorious, confusing ocean of digital marketing, I thought it'd be a breeze. I'd read all the blogs, watched all the gurus, and felt ready to conquer the world... or at least get some decent ROI for a client.

My first real gig was for a small, local bakery. Sweetest people, amazing pastries, but their online presence was basically a tumbleweed. I built their campaigns, optimized keywords, crafted what I thought were killer ad copies. And then? Crickets. Absolute, deafening silence. My analytics dashboard was a sea of red, mocking my efforts. Zero conversions. Barely any clicks. I spent weeks pouring over data, tweaking bids, rewriting ads, feeling this cold dread creep in. Was I actually terrible at this? The late nights, the endless coffee – it all felt like a giant waste.

I was seriously contemplating quitting. I felt like such a fraud, staring at my screen at 3 AM, trying to figure out why nothing was working. Then, almost by accident, while reviewing their old, dusty website, I stumbled upon a tiny, almost hidden section about their 'Grandma's Secret Recipes' for some of their most popular items. It was just a couple of paragraphs, buried deep.

And that was it. The tiny spark. I completely pivoted the ad strategy. Instead of generic 'Best Bakery in Town,' I started crafting ads around 'Taste Grandma's Secret Apple Pie' and 'The Ancient Sourdough Recipe Revealed.' I targeted local foodies, home bakers, and even people interested in 'comfort food.' The next morning, I woke up, groggily checked the dashboard, and my jaw hit the floor. Conversions were up. Way up. Like, 'Is this a glitch?' up. The phone at the bakery started ringing off the hook for custom orders, and their online sales skyrocketed.

It wasn't a sudden genius move; it was pure, desperate luck finding that hidden gem and then leaning into it with everything I had. It taught me that sometimes, the magic isn't in the fanciest new tool or the most complex strategy, but in digging deep to find that unique, authentic story a brand has to tell. That little bakery became my first big success story, and honestly, the relief was so intense I almost cried. It felt like I'd finally cracked a secret code.

Problem I keep running into:
During travel, late nights, or after workouts, I want a decent milk coffee, not black coffee. But milk is often unavailable, spoils easily, or feels heavy on digestion. Cafes aren’t always an option, and pantry coffee is usually bad.

So I’m exploring the idea of a plant-based instant coffee sachet where you just add hot water. It includes non-dairy milk, so you still get a proper milk coffee without carrying milk separately.

Trying to understand if this resonates.

What I’m curious about:
• Is this a real problem for you?
• Would you prefer this to regular premix sachets?
• Would you pay around ₹45–50 for a cleaner, non-dairy option?
• When would you actually use something like this?

Looking for honest takes.

I had an endoscopy done in July and have been taking pantoprazole for about 4ish months now.

My symptoms were minor - tightness in chest and throat, occasional heartburn. Almost no pain, no difficulty breathing, and mostly just discomfort. Endoscopy revealed my throat and stomach were irritated.

On my PPIs, I'm almost symptom free as long as I don't go crazy. Although the effectiveness is maybe wearing off. I wasn't really cutting out a lot of triggers at the time, though. (I guess I should have been...)

I've started keeping a food journal and cut out 99% of the common triggers. (The common triggers were basically my entire diet lol.)

Now I'm 1.5 weeks into the ""Dropping Acid"" induction diet. I may extend it for another week or 2 to see how I do on it without meds. I've already lost 5-10 pounds just eating plain ass food. In a few weeks when I know the induction diet is going okay without meds, I'll try reintroducing other things a bit at a time.

My gastroenterologist was not super helpful. He basically said ""you can try going off the meds after 90 days, or not. Cut out the coffee."" So I've been sort of just flying blind. I do have a follow up appointment with him in September.

How do you deal with a husband (37M) who isn’t necessarily displaying weaponized incompetence when it comes to chores? What I (F 30) mean by this, for example, yesterday he decides to get a snack from the cupboard, it’s rice cakes that are kind of broken up and crumbly. Instead of getting a plate so that the crumbs fall on the damn plate he just starts eating them out of the bag and surprise surprise, makes a huge mess on the floor/coffee table. He cleans the mess (he always does) but still leaves very small crumbs on the coffee table which he claims he “did not see.” So obviously I point it out, and then we have a little fight about it like always, and I end up finishing the mess cleaning (as always). My logic is, if you are cleaning a mess, why would you not double check to see if it is perfectly clean?? Are men just like this?

This is just one example but it happens almost everyday and I end up always “completing the cleaning.” How do other wives or girlfriends deal with this? Like is this my life? This seems like such a small thing but it keeps happening. Clutter and mess give me anxiety/stresses me out, I have been diagnosed with OCD so it really shows in regards to keeping a clean house. He knows I have this clean obsession but instead of doing better he just makes fun of it. I don’t work at the moment, so I don’t mind doing all the house stuff but I start work in about a week, so am I going to have to work outside the house, and make sure he cleans up after himself properly too at home?",1,1767802903.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False
