**Boil Time:** 60 minutes  
**Mash Temp:** 67°C (153°F)  
**Fermentation Temp:** 30–35°C (ambient, fine for Kveik)

# ✅ 1. Ingredients

# Grains (Total: 1.25 kg)

|Grain|Amount|Purpose|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Weyermann Pale Ale Malt|**850 g**|Base malt|
|Weyermann Carapils|**100 g**|Adds body, head retention|
|Weyermann Caramunich Type 1|**100 g**|Light caramel sweetness|
|Joe White Chocolate Malt|**100 g**|Chocolate flavor|
|Weyermann Carafa Type 2|**100 g**|Deep color, smooth roast|

*(Reduced crystal content = better balance; still full-bodied and flavorful)*

# Hops

* **East Kent Goldings (EKG)** – total **12 g**
   * 10 g @ 60 minutes
   * 2 g @ 10 minutes

*(Gives \~25 IBU — smooth, earthy bitterness)*

# Adjuncts

* **Lactose:** 50–75 g (adds sweetness and creamy body)
* **Cacao nibs:** 20–25 g (for post-fermentation, soaked in vodka/bourbon 24 hrs)
* **Yeast Nutrient:** 1–2 g @ 10 min

# Yeast

* **Lallemand Voss Kveik** — use about **½ packet (2–3 g)** for 1 gallon. You can even sprinkle it directly into the cooled wort — no need to rehydrate.

# ✅ 2. Brew Day Process

**Mash (60 minutes):**

1. Heat **6.0 L** of water to **72°C (162°F)**.
2. Add your crushed grains in a mesh bag and stir.
3. Stabilize mash around **67°C** for **60 minutes**.
4. Lift and drain the bag — gently squeeze to recover wort.
5. You should have \~5 L pre-boil volume.

**Boil (60 minutes):**

* 60 min: Add **10 g EKG**
* 10 min: Add **2 g EKG**, **lactose (50–75 g)**, and **yeast nutrient**
* End of boil: Turn off heat, stir gently, and begin cooling.

**Cool & Ferment:**

1. Cool the wort to around **30–35°C** (Voss’s comfort zone).
   * An ice bath or cool tap water is fine — no need for full chilling.
2. Take your **OG reading** (should be around 1.065).
3. Transfer to sanitized fermenter and pitch yeast directly.
4. Ferment at **ambient temperature (30–35°C)** — ideal for the Philippines.
5. Expect fermentation to finish in **3–4 days**, maybe even faster.

**After Fermentation:**

* Once bubbling stops and gravity is stable:
   1. Soak **20–25 g cacao nibs** in **just enough vodka or bourbon** to cover them (12–24 hrs).
   2. Add nibs + soaking liquid into fermenter.
   3. Let sit **3–5 days**.

**Bottling:**

* Siphon beer into bottles, avoiding sediment.
* Add **1 Coopers carbonation drop per 330 mL** (or **2 per 500 mL**).
* Cap and store at room temp for **2–3 weeks**.
* Chill and enjoy after 4 weeks — flavor improves for another month.

If you ever need a bit of help — like translation, local guidance, or just company to explore or grab coffee — feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to meet travelers and share some local tips.

Also curious —
Have you been to Lijiang or Yunnan before?

I just purchased a Neo Flex. Super excited to dive into it all. I’m no stranger to espresso, I have my own coffee roasting business so I understand the coffee I am working with. However, I am new when it comes to lever espresso machines. I just can’t seem to figure out how to pull a shot with the bottomless portafilter. 

I’ve pulled 5 shots so far and they don’t build up any pressure or even feel like they come close. The water glides on through and the espresso becomes extremely acidic. 

I’ve done these 5 shots at various grind sizes going down to even the finest settings on my grinder (Breville). I first tried my Moka Pot grind which is a 14 on the espresso side of the grinder. Then I moved down to a 9, then to a 5. Then I would press down on the lever and I’d feel no resistance. My water temp is also at 212. 

I thought that the little black piece was potentially going to help, but through research it appears it’s just for splatter.

Context: 8 yrs after graduation from hs I rekindled a relationship with my HS sweetheart. We were together for 2 yrs and the last yr was long distance. We used to travel back and forth to his and my country. We got engaged and his mom spoke to me asking me why did we not just got married soon and told me to please not break his son’s heart, again. I thought this was an odd sentence but I chuck it all to the fact that they were all close. We set the date and started planning the wedding. Both families met, We saw venues, tried cakes, ordered dresses, selected colors and chose invites. Then the problems started. I wanted a small wedding with just close friends and relatives. His mom wanted a 350ppl wedding. I do not even know 350ppl. My wedding invite list was 20 ppl max including us 6 in my family- 4 siblings and 2 parents. I lost that fight. His mom decided she was paying for the wedding and that she wanted her list of people included. The list even had an ex president on it- [I guess they were in the political scene. I was and still am not. I stated that if the wedding was going to be that expensive I would rather use that money for the down payment for a house that way we are investing it in our future not in a party. For some reason that was unreasonable. His mom was very worried about appearances. 

It was 2 months to my wedding when I found out my fiancé was lying to me. He moved in with me and we had been living together for over 3 months and he did not have a job yet. for a lawyer with a Master’s and a Doctorates degree I found that really odd. He explained that he had lost all his documentation in a fire and because he could not corroborate with documents he was not able to get a job but that he was still going to interviews. I told him that my dad’s Alma mater was the same as his university. He (my dad) still had contacts there so we probably could get copies of his documents for the interviews while he works on doing the paper work to get his degrees replaced. Immediately he shut that down and told me that my family and I had already done so much for him that he did not want them to do more so that he did not feel mode indebted. 5 mins after that phone call his mother called me. She immediately told me that they had already hired a lawyer to take care of the paperwork and not to worry about it. The response was so immediate I just got the feeling they were hiding something.

So- I called the University directly. I told them I was from Human Resources and I had an application from a man for a confidential position and I needed to confirm credentials. This is a common part of the hiring process in my country. I got transferred like 4 times to the records dept - every time explaining my request. I had all his info including his IDNumber. After the lovely lady that got my called checked she told me several things: 1- they do not have doctorates in the university. 2-they had his records but he had dropped out of the university on the first semester of his bachelors because he could not provide his High School graduation documentation. I thanked her and took a 30 min break from work because I was processing this information. 

I called him back- told him what I found out and asked him to explain. He told me that we would talk at home and to drive safely. I work an hour from home and I drove back and forth every day. That night we had dinner with my parents, everything seemed normal and then we proceeded to go to my apt. 

After the front door to the apt closed I turned around and said 1 word: Explain! (It was calm and clear) I sat on the sofa, crossed my ankles and put my hands on my legs sitting princess style, waiting, looking him straight in the eyes. 

He got startled and started stuttering some nonsense about his mom stealing all his dreams and things like that… I sighed in exasperation lifted my hand in a ‘’stop kind of motion’’ and he froze in place. I asked him plain and clear: ‘’You are telling me that a full grown ass man at 27 yrs old, you are going to blame your mom for lying to me?’’He just looked at me and had nothing to say. Apparently he never thought about any other explanation and just blanked out. So I told him to leave my apartment, I got up and put a 100 dollar bill on the coffee table and told him that he should go to his mom and because He was probably broke he should take the money and get out. He had till the morning and I went to bed. He said it was all a misunderstanding and I said he had until the wedding to prove it. He never did!

The issue at hand: Before he left I asked him to sign a document stating the loan my dad and I gave him and his family. The info includes all the terms of the loan: the loan amount, the interest rate, his name, signature and his ID number. It’s been 11 yrs since. Not one penny has been payed. 

3 weeks after he left I found out I was pregnant. I told him but he did not want to pay anything so my son is mine. I have a beautiful son and he is the light of my life. My ex moved on and got married to someone else and has a family in a city 40 mins from my city. 

I just found out I have an auto immune illness and I am not able to work long hours anymore because I am in pain. Looking through paperwork I found the paper and checked compounding interests online and now the original loan amount is a LOT of money. I could use the money, but basically I would destroy his life. Should I do it or should I just forget about it? I do not want him in my life. I had such a hard time the years after trying to survive and rebuild. My parents kicked me out when they found out I was pregnant, my boss at the time was a lifesaver. He gave me a loan that helped me settle and have a decent place to live but I was in a really bad place after because of post partum Depression and was numb for a couple of years. I am back to feeling like myself and now fighting to adapt to this new life with this illness so I am not sure if I want this fight. He for sure will make it an issue. He has never seen or met my son. This would also be a shitty situation for them to meet. I never explained why we broke up so to ppl around us know I was the one who broke up and he is the victim. I do not know if it is worth it. Should I sue him to get my money plus interest back?

Help me decide……

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.

“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg.

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the real her. Because the person sitting before me today was not my wife.

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below.

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she has to know, right?

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,”

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view.

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms.

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear.

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

Getting good grades in her studies, a good-paying internship, and a cozy apartment that she shared with her perfect boyfriend. She couldn't imagine her life being any different, but of course, something had to go wrong.

Y/c was about to open the door to their apartment, but before she could twist the handle, it opened. Y/c’s boyfriend stood there. His eyes were red and his cheeks were wet. “I have to go.” He said before walking past Y/c. “You have changed too much.” He whispered as the two passed each other. 

That was the last thing Y/c heard or saw from her boyfriend. He was gone, just like that. Y/c couldn't afford the apartment alone, and reluctantly she agreed to rent the spare bedroom in her best friend's apartment. 

Elias Webb, is the newest recruit at the local NHL team, Wildshore Wolfs. At the age of 24, Elias is used to live fast- on the ice and in life. He is running from a past, littered with fights, bad press, and broken promises. Determined to prove that he is more than his reputation as a hot-headed wing. When he moves into town as a fresh start, his only focus is hockey.

That was until he met y/c. 

Their first meeting was anything but romantic. Elias accidentally bumps into Y/c at a café, spilling her coffee all over her. Y/c glared at him. There is something about her fire, her refusal to fall at his feet like everyone else, that pulls him in. Y/c on the other end wants nothing to do with this cocky hockey player, who seemed to have fallen out of a rom-com. 

Or at least that was what she thought. 

Y/c and her friend sat watching television. There was nothing on that night, so to Y/c’s disappointment, the two ended up watching the game. Y/c telling her friend all about how the cocky player spilled her coffee. He didn't even ask to buy her a new one. 

Suddenly he was on the tv. An interviewer asked him about himself. Suddenly he got a question about what he thought about the women in town. The hockey player smirked. Revealed a missing tooth. He chuckled. “Actually, I met one today. Pretty fierce.” He admitted. The interviewer was clearly invested. “This is a long shot, but if you are watching. Call the team number. Let me buy you another coffee.” He gave a wink to the camera before walking off. 

Y/c shook her head. No way. She was not going to give in to that cocky player. However, her friend had another idea. Y/c blamed all the books her friend read. After a long discussion between the two girls, she finally gave in. Called the number and explained what had happened, to prove it was her. 

Despite their differences, they can’t seem to stay away from each other. Their connection is electric, raw, and undeniable, but it’s also messy and volatile. Elias’s temper and Y/c’s guarded heart clash in explosive arguments that always seem to end in disagreement. Their love is a whirlwind of passion and pain, marked by moments of tender vulnerability—like Elias showing Y/c how to skate under the stars or Y/c patching him up after a brutal game fight.",1,1760011853.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

Heres the story:
2023
Pre-covid I was addicted to cycling, that was my only sport. Then covid hit, I stopped because of the risk of getting infected. Post-covid, I decided to hit the gym then eventually became interested in Powerlifting. I was doing ATG (full knee flexion - ass to grass) barbell squats then felt a snap right at the bottom of the ROM. It was a fair weight, manageable to muscle it up from the bottom. Decided to still show up to the gym, thinking its only some sort of strain, but it just wont go away. The impressions from my recent MRI is right, the source of the pain is from the outer back of the left knee. No locking, but it definetely hurts when doing bodyweight squats to certain degree of knee flexion. For cycling, I feel the pain on the top of the pedal stroke where the knee is bent the most. 

2024
From that event, I fully stopped on doing lower body exercise and only do upper body work in my home gym. The pain went away within a few months. I was able to bike commute pain free. For a whole year, my routine to keep active was to do only upper work and bike commute to uni around 5km one-way. No coffee rides or lower body work at all.

2025
Start of 2025, I decided to get into triathlon. Started building my running volume in a slow manner. I am a bad runner, I always feel pain on both my shins, that one day I was doing hill sprints then started to feel shin splints on my right leg feeling my shins gonna break into two. Took a month off then started again. Recovering from that, I started to incorporate speed work. It was my first time trying strides after an easy run. Thats when my left knee pain started to show up again post workout. Decided to stay off running from that point and focused heavily on my swim and bike. Was crushing specifically my cycling volume, I can do 200km back to back rides with no knee pain during and after. I finally decided to check up with an ortho and recommended me for an mri (see photo above). She recommended me to do single leg exercises because my quads is imbalanced. I believe that has been the case since I got into cycling like around 6 years ago. I got back into gym again a month ago and started with only leg presses and majority of the exercise being hinges and for calves. But every after gym session, the pain is getting worse. I just cant do quad focused exercise, even if its only bodyweight. She recommended to do pt and if it doesnt get any better, surgery. Started my 1st pt session few days ago. Limited ROM (no weightbearing) was seen and then pt did a full knee bend lying down until I feel pain only on my left leg. Felt a pain up to my feet and hips when I reach the feeling point. The pain got worse and I also felt it during cycling post pt. Debating whether or not pt is the way. I just dont want this pain to be back again after some time, if it gets better for this 8 pt sessions. My mom is against surgery but if its for the long term to the point I can keep running and doing gym work until my 60s, then I would be down for it.

1o245cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrettyChaos/comments/1o245cj/first_date_with_cali_logan/,First Date with Cali Logan,"I spent twenty minutes trying to decide what to wear — which, for me, was basically a lifetime. My closet looked like a battlefield of “maybes,” but I finally settled on dark jeans, a soft cream sweater, and my favorite boots. My hair — brown and stubborn — fell in loose waves that refused to behave, but honestly, I was too nervous to care. Tonight was my first date with Noah.

We’d been talking for about a month — texts that stretched past midnight, memes sent between meetings, and those tiny moments when I caught myself smiling at my phone like a fool. So when he asked if I wanted to catch a movie with him, I said yes before I could overthink it.

https://preview.redd.it/t4pnzpwns0uf1.jpg?width=1285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1a0a2a740dbe459ce42848c9f88028d3cf9ec56

The theater was one of those small local ones — a little old, a little creaky, but full of character. The smell of buttered popcorn hit me the second I walked in, warm and familiar. I spotted him waiting near the ticket counter, hands shoved in his jacket pockets, smiling the second he saw me. He looked better in person — softer somehow, real in a way that made my stomach flutter.

“Hey,” he said, a little shyly. “You look… wow.”

I laughed, brushing a piece of hair behind my ear. “You clean up pretty well yourself.”

We picked an action-comedy — something light, something safe. During the movie, we shared popcorn, and I caught him glancing at me during the funny parts, like he wanted to see if I was laughing too. At one point, our hands brushed in the bucket, and neither of us moved away. My heart felt like it might trip over itself.

After the credits rolled, neither of us seemed ready to say goodnight. So he suggested coffee — there was a small café across the street, half-empty and glowing softly through the windows. We grabbed a corner booth, steaming mugs between us, and for the first time all night, the nervousness faded.

We talked about everything — how he once got lost hiking in Colorado, how I’d always wanted to learn guitar but never stuck with it. He told me his mom used to own a bakery, and I told him my dad still sends me bad dad jokes every morning. It felt easy. Familiar. Like we were two people who’d known each other in another life and were just catching up now.

At one point, he looked at me and said, “I’m really glad you came tonight.” His voice was soft, like he wasn’t sure if he should say it out loud.

I smiled. “Me too.”

When we finally stepped outside, the air was crisp and smelled faintly of rain. He walked me to my car, hands brushing again, a quiet electricity between us. There was a pause — that almost-moment where everything could happen — but instead, he just grinned and said, “Next time, coffee’s on me.”

“Next time,” I repeated, smiling as I opened my door.

And as I drove home, I couldn’t stop replaying the night — the laughter, the shared popcorn, the coffee. For the first time in a long while, I wasn’t wondering what would go wrong. I was wondering what might come next.",1,1760011652.0,PrettyChaos,0,1.0,False

----
1. Wheres Nick - it is about 10-15 minutes from the train station and has been one place I was most looking forward to. Chalkboard list of wines that were $15-30 a glass. When I asked to taste 2 wines I was thinking of I was told ""we're not a cellar door"". No free tastings. Confused about a wine bar with new funky wines didn't do it I was kinda baffled. I ordered a $20 McLaren rose red that I found oxidized and alcoholic. I was told they tasted it earlier and it was fine. Not going to argue I paid and left. I won't be back!
2. Marrickville Hotel - after leaving Nick's and being treated quite rudely and served oxidized wine I wasn't expecting much. They allowed tastes off the menu and ordered a chilled Grenache and Chardonnay. List was well priced and cool vibe to the pub. 
3. Thirstville Bottle shop Bar - what a great find only few blocks away. Multiple organic wines by the glass $15-$17 and staff gave free tastes. Loved this Doom Juice and I ended up buying a few glasses and bottles to take home. You are allowed to buy a bottle and pay corkage and drink in store. Staff super friendly and lots of great food on the street. 
----
- overall in Sydney I was hoping for more wine bars with interesting organic natural wine. I personally found the first bar up themselves and I wouldn't go back personally but loved the bottle shop concept. 
I view the wine industry as in trouble due to GenZ not drinking and older guys like myself not buying as much. Wine bars not giving tastes is utterly pretentious like Napa Valley $75 wine flights to taste crap wine. I'll continue going to different wine bars in Sydney over the last few weeks of my trip.

​We are launching a focused campaign to fundamentally uplift Nepal's economy, and it starts with every one of us: the ""Nepali First"" Economic Challenge. This is a powerful, conscious decision to prioritize goods and services made right here in our country. When we choose Nepali-made coffee, handicrafts, textiles, or tech services over imported alternatives, that money is immediately recycled back into our system. This commitment creates a vital economic multiplier effect, directly funding local wages, supporting our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and generating crucial tax revenue for government investment in essential infrastructure like schools and hospitals.

​Our goal is to make supporting local the default choice, reducing our massive trade deficit and fostering a stable, self-reliant economy. To make this a success, we need collective, visible action. We are asking everyone to implement the ""Five-Second Check"" before any purchase: is there a quality Nepali option? If so, choose it. This simple habit, performed consistently across the nation, will provide the sustained demand necessary for local businesses to innovate, improve quality, and compete globally.

​The final, crucial step is amplification: we need to spread this trend virally across all social media platforms. Take a photo or video of your favorite Nepali product and share it with your networks, challenging friends and family to do the same. This public visibility and enthusiasm will make ""Nepali First"" the dominant, proud national purchasing habit. Let's showcase the incredible talent and quality of Nepali products and turn this challenge into a powerful, irreversible economic movement!",1,1760011207.0,u_yohbro,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

i’ve been working on carving out my own peace but the soul wants connection. and now i feel stuck on where i might find my people. ultimately i decided id commit to learning music as i see so many music artists creating music to fight the systems and spread wisdom and i want to be a part of that but i can’t do anything at the moment with no money or resources (job hunting right now). so i feel i dont have a way ‘in’ to that community.

1o23vn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1o23vn3/explore_binbata_laundry_detergent_sheets_for/,Explore Binbata Laundry Detergent Sheets for Sensitive Skin,"Using detergent is one of those mundane tasks I usually don’t give much thought to, but testing out the Binbata B09KTFNTYT laundry detergent sheets turned an everyday chore into an interesting experiment. At first glance, I was intrigued by the concept of “detergent sheets” because, truth be told, I had never ventured beyond the traditional liquid or powder options. With this item promising 128 loads in a lightweight, plastic-free, and environmentally friendly package, I was keen to see if it lived up to its buzzworthy claims.

**Eco-Friendly and Compact Design**  
Carrying around a chunky detergent bottle is, admittedly, not my favorite part of laundry day. This product challenges that inconvenience head-on with its super compact size and biodegradable packaging. The package easily sits in one corner of my laundry cabinet, unlike liquid detergent containers that seem to dominate the entire space. During my recent camping trip, I tossed a small stack of these sheets into my bag, and voilà, laundry on the go was a breeze. Of course, its plastic-free promise and reduced carbon emissions were definite guilt-relievers for my eco-conscious side.

**Efficacy and Cleaning Power**  
I have to admit, I had my doubts about whether a paper-thin sheet could handle tough stains. I tested this on everything from grass-streaked soccer uniforms to coffee-stained white tees (don’t judge me—I’m clumsy). To my surprise, the polymer concentration technology these sheets boast about actually comes through. Even on tougher stains, using two sheets worked like a charm. With a single sheet, everyday grime on sweatshirts and jeans disappeared as if my laundry had been through some detergent wizardry. No harsh chemicals left my clothes feeling rough, offering a much-needed break for the skin.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Compact and highly portable, perfect for travel or small storage spaces  
- Plastic-free and biodegradable packaging lessens environmental impact  
- Effective against common stains, even with a single sheet  
- Free from phosphates and harsh chemicals, making it suitable for kids and sensitive skin  
- Dissolves well in hot, cold, or even hard water without leaving residue  

[Curious about Binbata B09KTFNTYT? Amazon might have a discount.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b09ktfntyt/)

**Ease of Use and Packaging Design**  
This product shifted my perception about laundry detergent being a hassle. The sheets are pre-measured, so I no longer need to fuss with measuring caps or scoops. Just pop a sheet into the machine, and let it do its thing. For an experimental touch, I tore one sheet in half for a lighter load, and it worked equally well. It’s also child-safe—a significant relief as a parent—since it avoids the spill hazards of liquid detergent.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The unscented formula might feel lackluster to those who like scented laundry aromas  
- Not ideal for overly significant soiling like oil or heavy-duty messes on the first try  
- The thin sheets can stick together if exposed to humidity  

**Comparison With Peer Products**  
When comparing these detergent sheets to traditional liquid or powder detergents I’ve relied on over the years, the standout factor is convenience. Old-school large detergent bottles become cumbersome, especially if stairs are involved (I’m looking at you, apartment dwellers). On the other hand, liquid-free pods also present a solution, but those can sometimes leave residue on clothes—a problem I didn’t experience with these sheets. While traditional options offer variety in fragrance, I think this sheet keeps its advantage in portability and minimalist storage requirements. However, price-conscious buyers might lean towards liquids for their cost-per-load efficiency, but lately, I value reducing wastefulness more.

**Value for Money**  
Let's talk about cost-effectiveness. At first glance, the lack of bulk may seem like you’re getting less product despite the claimed 128 loads. But considering how far one sheet stretches, especially when doing small to medium-sized loads, I found the value quite reasonable. Plus, skipping out on buying large, single-use plastic bottles significantly outweighs the upfront spending hesitation. Is it a budget buy? Not the cheapest, but definitely worth aligning with eco-conscious goals.

1o23s4w,https://v.redd.it/xv17wkdzq2uf1,What is the Probability That We’re Living in a Simulation?,"The mind-bending math and logic behind your possible pixelated life

Could your morning coffee, your favorite playlist, or even this very sentence be part of an elaborate simulation? The question of whether we are living in a computer-generated reality has moved from sci-fi musings to serious philosophical debate. This post breaks down the actual probability framework behind simulation theory—not just the thought experiment, but the math that makes some philosophers take it seriously.

The Simulation Argument, Simplified

In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed a trilemma that shook modern philosophy:

The Great Filter: Most civilizations go extinct before becoming technologically mature.
The Disinterest Hypothesis: Advanced civilizations have no interest in ancestor simulations.
The Simulation Hypothesis: We are almost certainly living in a simulation.
If options 1 and 2 are false, option 3 must be true. But how do we assess which is most likely?

The Math Behind the Madness

Bostrom’s math is simple but powerful:

If N is the number of real civilizations and each runs M simulations, there are N real worlds and N × M simulated ones.

Assuming no way to distinguish between them:

P(simulated) = M / (M + 1)

Some quick numbers:

10 simulations: 10/11 ≈ 91%
100 simulations: 100/101 ≈ 99%
1,000 simulations: ≈ 99.9%
Even modest simulation activity skews the odds heavily toward us being simulated. The math compounds quickly.

The Bayesian Take: What Should We Believe?

Start with agnostic priors: 33% for each possibility. Then update the evidence for the following:

Great Filter:

The Fermi Paradox
Near-misses with extinction
Challenges of space travel
Disinterest:

Ethical qualms about simulating suffering
Potentially high computational costs
Alternate uses for processing power
Simulation:

We already build simple simulations
Computing power grows exponentially
Quantum computing could simulate minds
Physics appears discrete and computable
Expert estimates:

David Chalmers: ~25%
Neil deGrasse Tyson: ~50%
Elon Musk: “Billions to one” (~99.9999%)
The wide range shows it’s speculative but grounded in logic.

Strongest Counterarguments

1. Computational Limits (Sabine Hossenfelder)
Simulating quantum details might require more resources than the universe has.

2. Consciousness Gap (John Searle)
If experience needs a biological substrate, simulated minds may not be conscious.

3. Circular Probabilities
Using hypothetical simulations to calculate probabilities assumes the conclusion.

4. Lazy Universe Objection
Our universe doesn’t act like a simulation—it renders detail everywhere, not just where observed.

Real-World Analogy: The Video Game Universe

Imagine The Sims, but powered by a Dyson Sphere. With enough energy, entire civilizations could be simulated—billions of agents with memories and agency.

We’ve gone from Pong to photorealistic worlds in 50 years. What could 500 or 5,000 more bring?

Can We Detect a Simulation?

Lattice Spacetime:
Some theories suggest cosmic rays might reveal a pixelated universe. No evidence yet.

Glitches & Patches:
Phenomena like the Mandela Effect or quantum strangeness could be “glitches”—but that’s unfalsifiable.

Messages from Designers:
If they wanted to contact us, they could. Their silence is telling.

Rendering Limits:
Quantum mechanics might hint at a universe that only renders what’s measured—but that’s still speculative.

Bottom line: A perfect simulation wouldn’t let us detect it.

Why It Matters—or Doesn’t

Philosophical impact:

Redefines consciousness and free will
Blurs line between creator and creation
Practical takeaway:
Max Tegmark: “If it quacks like a duck and feels like a universe, it is one.”

Even if simulated, pain, love, and physics are still real to us.

The Verdict: Quantifying the Unquantifiable

My estimate:

Great Filter: 40%
Disinterest: 35%
Simulation: 25%
A 1-in-4 chance we’re simulated: worth considering, not stressing.

But these are speculative guesses with huge error bars. The logic holds, but the premises remain uncertain.

If simulations are common and indistinguishable, the math suggests we’re likely inside one.

Summary: Is Reality Just Really Good Graphics?

Simulation theory urges us to rethink our assumptions about reality, tech, and selfhood. If it’s true, we’re digital ghosts in a cosmic machine. If it’s not, we’re still pondering one of philosophy’s most exciting questions.

Either way, the act of asking is its own kind of awakening.

🧬 QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding. What to do now (think clearly about your reality):

Existence String
“What is consciousness?” →

“Could it be artificially generated?” →

“How would I know if my thoughts are real or programmed?”

Try journaling or debating with this framework. It’s a reliable way to push thinking past surface-level speculation.

I did an at home sperm test back in February 2025. It showed low sperm count and low motility.

I was always reasonably healthy in the last ten years. I was previously diagnosed over 15 years ago with a thyroid issue which has since sorted itself out and I don't take any medication for anything. 

I've taken various supplements for years but since the test ive increased and focused on the obvious ones for sperm health.

It is hard when I read posts describing what you have to do eg lose weight, stop smoking drinking, eat healthy, dont drink coffee... well I never did any of these things for over 10 years and I my BMI is 21 meaning I am slim and tall.

So I literally can't do those standard recommendations. The only thing I can really do is increase exercise. My job is very physical, but I only do about 1hr working out a week. Ive also been a few times a week putting ice packs on testicles.

I cook healthy clean vegetables and meat from a local farm. My weakness is sugar.

Anyway, my recent sperm test was done by a doctor and it showed still a low count, motility had increased and was normal but it also showed IGG which suggests autoimmune antibodies 25% and 100% abnormal sperm, predominantly amorphous which is a head defect.

The doctor wants another test in 3 months since spermogenesis takes around 3 months.

I guess I will just have to eat even more healthily than I am, I cant really take more supplements apart from switching brands (I don't buy cheap ones), i can't avoid the thing things I don't do already and do the things I am already doing!

Which leads me to think that it may be genetic

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Personal finance site [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/cities-where-people-spend-the-most-least-on-groceries/147476) looked at 100 of the largest cities to see what percentage of the average household income is spent on [common grocery items](https://thehill.com/business/personal-finance/5453194-trump-tariffs-grocery-prices/).

The analysis found that those from Detroit spend a higher percentage of their incomes on groceries than residents of any other U.S. city, with a median cost of nearly 3.8 percent. While grocery prices were somewhat average — despite having the 10th-most expensive lettuce and the 17th-most expensive tuna, according to WalletHub — the average household income was the second lowest ($39,575).

For me, doing vegan activism has meant that I no longer feel powerless, and instead I feel that I'm helping the animals, so my vystopia has massively reduced.

I used to have a negative stereotype of activists (you might have the same one - aggressive, shouty, attention-seeking), but that has not remotely been my experience. I've probably met over 40 activists now and they're all just ordinary people who happen to love animals.

The type of activism I do is street advocacy, where we show footage and talk to the public about veganism. The vast majority of people I've spoken to have been open-minded and compassionate; many of them are crying or shaking after watching the footage, and many of them say they'll go vegan on the spot. It's incredibly rewarding.

I'm a massive introvert who doesn't even like ordering coffee, but I have found that when it comes to speaking for the animals I'll happily talk to anyone and everyone. I just think about how the animals are suffering, and all my social anxiety melts away. I'm at my most confident when I'm doing advocacy.

So if you want to help the animals, and help yourself out of vystopia, I strongly recommend trying activism. I found my groups on Facebook - they're an hour away, but it is so worth it. In fact, it's the best thing I've ever done.",13,1760009949.0,Vystopia,0,1.0,False

Basically what the title says.

Long time HIT sufferer here, almost 17 years. For such a long time I couldn't figure out for the life of me, what was wrong with my body. I had all the classic symptoms - food intolerances especially those high in histamine (fish, shellfish, soy sauce, mushrooms, ketchup, coffee, chocolate and so on), periodic hives and severe itching, chronic fatigue, general malaise, brain fog, inability to focus, tired easily, inflamed body and face and the list goes on. All of these symptoms were cyclical, I felt well for about 5 days in a month, the other 25 were just miserable.

Fast forward 17 years, I got diagnosed with mild Crohn's disease during a colonoscopy to figure out the cause of my persistent constipation, GERD and occasional diarrhoea. There I had my aha moment after years and years of frustration and denial by doctors and society in general that something was very wrong with me.

After 6 months of treatment, I am feeling like a new person altogether.

I just wanted to let it out here, so it provides clues to people who're suffering like me but don't know what's wrong with them. Well, mild Crohn's could be one of the reasons.

Longtime lurker here. I have rhinosinusitis, have had the surgery for deviated septum and polyps, and use nasal spray regularly paired with neilmed sinus rinse when I feel 'blocked'.

One issue I have: coughing and gagging. 

Ive found that some things trigger me to cough, and when I have mucus in my throat from postnatal drip, gag. 

Coffee in the morning, sharp temperature changes (e.g. entering a warm building on a snowy day), alcohol (beer more than any), and.... gross things? 

To the last part - ive found that since having this condition, I have a much weaker stomach. If I take out the compost, do nasty dishes, or something similar, I find myself very quick to gag. I suspect this is a combination of post-nasal drip and some acid reflux - its the perfect storm waiting for a nasty smell to trigger gagging. 

I love coffee and beer, so I have no present intentions to cut them from my life, but Im wondering - am I alone in this? Does anyone else cough and gag more now? What are your triggers? ",1,1760009474.0,Sinusitis,0,1.0,False

I wake up, check my Meta ads like I do every morning with my coffee, and my stomach drops.

ROAS went from a consistent 3.8x to 1.9x overnight. Just... gone.

At first I thought it was a fluke. Bad day, weird audience behavior, Mercury in retrograde, whatever. But then day 2. Day 3. Day 7.

ROAS stuck around 1.8-2.1x. Fluctuating wildly. Campaigns that had been stable for MONTHS were now all over the place.

I'm selling skincare products. $85 AOV. Was spending about $25K/month profitably. Now I'm burning money and have no idea why.

**The ""oh shit"" moment**

Week 2 of this nightmare, I'm on a Zoom with like 50 other store owners and everyone's losing their minds. Same story everywhere - ads just stopped working.

Someone mentions iOS 14.5 and the whole call goes quiet.

I'd heard about it but honestly thought it wouldn't affect me that much. Apple made some privacy changes, whatever, I'll adapt.

Yeah. I was an idiot.

**Here's what actually broke**

Before: Someone on an iPhone clicks my Meta ad, buys something, Meta's pixel tracks the whole thing. Click → site → cart → purchase. Clean data.

After: Apple pops up a message like ""hey do you want Facebook tracking you?"" and shockingly, most people said no.

Now when someone clicks my ad, Meta sees the click but then... nothing. Person buys but Meta can't connect it. From Meta's perspective they just vanished.

**What this meant for my campaigns**

Meta thought my ads weren't converting, so it stopped showing them to good audiences. My Shopify dashboard showed sales were fine. Meta's dashboard showed everything was on fire.

The algorithm was making decisions based on bad data. Like trying to drive a car where the speedometer just shows random numbers.

I wasn't losing money because the ads stopped working. I was losing money because Meta couldn't SEE that they were working, so it kept making terrible optimization choices.

**Month 1: Denial and panic**

Tried all the stuff from Facebook groups:

* Verified domain (didn't help)
* Aggregated event measurement (barely helped)
* Simplified conversion events (somehow worse??)
* Switched to value optimization (lol)
* Sacrificed a chicken to the algorithm gods (kidding but I was desperate)

Nothing worked. ROAS stayed garbage.

But my Shopify numbers were fine! Customers were still buying! Meta just couldn't see it.

**Month 2: Down the rabbit hole**

Kept seeing people mention ""Conversions API"" and ""server-side tracking"" but it sounded like you needed a PhD in computer science.

I can barely handle Shopify themes without breaking something.

But I was desperate so I spent like 40 hours just reading documentation, watching random YouTube videos, lurking in Discord servers.

Finally figured out what it actually does:

Instead of the Meta pixel (which iOS blocks), you send conversion data straight from your server to Meta. Apple can't block it because it's not happening in the browser.

Pixel still works for people who allow tracking. Server-side fills in the gaps for everyone who opted out.

**The implementation (three weeks of pain)**

I'm on Shopify which apparently makes this easier but it still sucked.

Set up Meta's Conversions API. Configure server-side events. Make sure nothing's duplicating. Optimize event matching quality.

Test everything a million times.

The biggest nightmare was event matching quality. This is Meta's score for how well it can match your server events to actual people. Below 6.0 and the data is basically useless.

Mine started at 3.2. Cool cool cool.

**What was broken**

* Wasn't hashing emails correctly (Meta needs SHA256)
* External ID wasn't consistent
* Missing fbp and fbc parameters (apparently critical??)
* Event names didn't match exactly
* Not sending enough matching parameters

Took me almost 2 weeks to get matching quality above 8.0. So many error messages. So much coffee.

**Week 3, things started working**

Meta's Events Manager suddenly started showing way more conversions. Like, numbers that actually matched Shopify.

Before: Meta showing 40-60 purchases per day After: Meta showing 85-100 purchases per day

That gap? All iOS users Meta couldn't see before.

**Week 4, campaigns came back to life**

ROAS started climbing. 2.1x → 2.6x → 3.1x → 3.4x

But my actual business hadn't really changed. Meta could just finally SEE the results.

Algorithm started making good decisions again. Learning phases finished faster. CPA stopped being a random number generator.

**Two months later**

* Reported ROAS: 3.6x (was 1.9x during the dark times)
* Actual ROAS: 3.7x (was always around 3.2-3.4x, Meta just couldn't see it)
* Campaign stability: Actually predictable again
* Event match quality: Holding steady at 8.5+
* Can scale without everything exploding

**Stuff nobody tells you**

Server-side tracking isn't just ""better tracking."" It completely changes how the algorithm optimizes because it can actually see what's happening.

When Meta sees 90% of conversions instead of 50%, it makes totally different targeting decisions. Better audiences, better bidding, better everything.

Also you can't just set it and forget it. Event match quality can degrade if you don't check it. I look at it weekly now.

**What I wish someone told me in May 2021**

iOS 14.5 didn't break your ads. It broke Meta's ability to see your results. The pixel alone is basically worthless now for optimization. Server-side tracking isn't optional anymore if you want campaigns that don't randomly implode.

Event matching quality matters more than just ""having CAPI turned on.""

And this is technical but it's not impossible. I figured it out and I'm not a developer.

**Current state**

Spending $42K/month now (up from $25K before iOS killed everything). Campaigns are stable. Meta's algorithm actually works because it has real data.

My store sees iOS users convert at the same rate as Android. But without server-side tracking, Meta would only see the Android conversions and the algorithm would optimize for the wrong people.

**The guide I made**

After suffering through this, I documented everything. Step-by-step Shopify setup. How to not break your pixel. Event matching optimization. Testing protocol. All the errors I hit and how to fix them.

Wrote it for normal people, not developers. If I could figure this out, anyone can.

If your Meta campaigns are still unstable or you're seeing reported ROAS way lower than your actual sales, it's probably this. Comment and I'll send the guide.

[I posted a few weeks back](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1n890j2/yet_another_yerevan_restaurant_recommendation/) asking for restaurant recommendations for Yerevan, and you all seriously came through. I am now back from teaching a 2 week workshop at TUMO, and Armenia absolutely blew me away - it was an incredible, amazing trip. 

First, TUMO- they were so impressive! The building and facilities are huge and modern and very cool. The staff were super helpful and friendly, and my students were so bright and enthusiastic! They picked up on everything right away, asked smart questions, helped each other, and outpaced my lesson plan pretty fast, so I ended up having to adjust to give them more to do! 

TUMO set me up in a cozy top floor apartment near Yeritasardakan, and while climbing that many stairs was pretty brutal after a long day, I had a great view of Ararat over the rooftops from my front windows, and it always took my breath away. I had a neat view of the Mother Armenia statue and the ferris wheel at Victory Park from the balcony, too.

Food: I didn’t get to nearly as many places as I wanted, but I ate so much amazing food. I ate at Anteb, Gini Pig, Artashi Mot, Mer Taghe, Zhengyalov Hats, Baron, Golden Khinkali, Lavash, and Rehan. Favorite dishes that were new to me: khashlama and ghavurma. I had outstanding coffee at Lumen, pi. pl, Afrolab, and a half dozen coffee stands whose names I forget. There seems to be coffee every 20 feet in Yerevan! Shops, kiosks, stands, and vending machines, and they were always busy, day and night! Yerevantsis like their coffee. :) 

I was usually pretty tired after classes, so I didn’t get to as many of the bars as I wanted. But I did manage to duck into Calumet once for a few cocktails, and I loved that place so much. It reminds me of all the boho cafes I used to hang out at in the late 90s. 

What else - I watched the dancing fountains at Republic Square, I caught the folk dancing at the Cascade on the last Friday of September, I had a blast wandering Vernissage and GUM market, I walked the length of Kond Pedestrian tunnel twice, and I rode all the escalators to the top of the Cascade for a stunning view of downtown Yerevan. I also managed to catch a tour over the weekend to the Symphony of Stones, Garni Temple, Geghard Monastery, and a traditional lavash baking demonstration.  

Thanks so much to everyone on this sub who gave me recommendations! It was a wonderful, breathtaking, amazing trip. Yerevan is a gorgeous, vibrant city, and I wish I had had even more time to explore it. Everyone I met was kind and friendly and welcoming. TUMO has already floated having me back in the future, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. :) ",4,1760009396.0,armenia,0,0.83,False

This is kind of an update post but I also genuinely want to know if IATAH

for other information about my feelings/situation towards my house mate you can see my previous post. Which I may reference here.

To simplify what happened. Me(29m) and my wife(29f)
And our kids went away for the weekend camping. For some reason I decided to put a camera in our bedroom.

We up on returning I checked the camera and caught the house mate entering out bedroom it was dark so could see exactly what he took but could see he went the my wife's wardrobe.

After showing my wife she confronted him and he denied it until we told him we had it on camera. Then he claimed he entered out bedroom to borrow lube???? So he could wank. 

Whilst it's hard to say if it's true or not. We do have a big bottle of lube I purchased years ago that is nearly every used. So I went and checked it and sure enough it basically empty. 

So now I have a few problems. As this indicates his been entering our room multiple times as the lube being gone as well as he knew exactly where in the bedroom to look. This a long with the fact I only rearranged the bedroom 2 months ago means he knew the new spot it was placed. 

The next problem I have with him coming in besides the fact it is my personal space is that 
We keep everything in our room from our family safe. Legal documents, personal belongings. And the wardrobe he entered is where my wife keeps her underwear and such as well. 

To top it all off I've always had the rule of no one in my room. Not even cleaners if we have them come. 

So with this having happened I reached out to him and his mother as he does everything through her. 
And sent her a very honest text you can read below:

Hi ((the mother) and (tenant). 

I'm not going to beat around the bush. What (tenant) has done has broken the most serious of boundaries and trust. 

I refuse to accept any excuses. Because frankly there's isn't one.

Allowing (tenant) into our living room and kitchen to help himself to our coffee,oven,ECT was out of our kindness and hospitality. 

Entering our private room and stealing from us has completely crossed the line and can't be down played we also know this has been several times in the last two months and probably more. 

Worst he lied straight to (wife) face when asked so I can't believe anything further he says regarding the manner of why. We keep many personal things in our room our family safe, documents. Mel's and my personal items. I don't know what the real reason he went in there but none are acceptable.

We fostered a relationship and helped (tenant) in many ways to help him grow. But a long the way the help just manifested into enablement and given him the ability to endulge In bad habits like gambling. 

We set our boundaries with (tenant) so very low and he stomped all over them. 

My job is to maintain the feeling safety in this house which I thought (tenant) understood. I can no longer do so with (tenant) here. Although I dont think it's deserved at all I'm willing to allow (tenant)up to a month to organize alternative accomodation going forward. 

His current outstanding bills are the power for September $25
And recent water delivery of $55. Rent will still be expected uptill the soonest Wednesday he resides here. And (wife) laptop that was lent returned before moving out. 

I wish (tenant) the best going forward but that isn't here anymore.
.

You can find more info in my other post. 
This is what is sent. So I guess now I'm after some reassurance I'm not over reacting.

My wife doesn't seem to be as angry as me more just betrayed and disappointed as she had a better relationship with him.
I have had mixed reactions from people I've told some just saying yeah it was kinda bad to some saying why I didn't call the police. Bash the shit out of him. Or kick him out on the spot. 

So here I am. Am I justified in doing so?

Simple Green 2710100802064 has become my go-to solution for tackling everyday messes around my home, and I can't say enough good things about its versatility and power. This all-purpose cleaner concentrate is a game-changer for anyone tired of juggling multiple products for different surfaces. Whether it’s stubborn grease in the kitchen or a random coffee spill on the carpet, this product handles it all. What stood out to me was its EPA Safer Choice Certification, which gave me peace of mind knowing I wasn’t exposing my family or pets to harmful chemicals while cleaning.   

**Outstanding Versatility**  

One of the most impressive features is how adaptable the cleaner is to all kinds of situations. I’ve used it on everything from countertops and tiled floors to outdoor patio furniture and even to pre-treat fabric stains. Its concentrated formula allows for flexible usage—full strength for challenging messes like baked-on stove grime, and diluted for simpler daily tasks such as wiping down surfaces. My mom borrowed it once to clean her car’s upholstery, and she won’t stop raving about the results.  

**Sassafras Scent That Lasts**  

The cleaning world is notorious for overpowering citrus or chemical smells. This product’s refreshing sassafras scent is a pleasant surprise. After mopping my floors or wiping the kitchen table, the whole house is left with a light, clean fragrance rather than a stink masked by synthetic scents. It feels good not just to see the clean space but also to smell it.   

[Find the best price for Simple Green 2710100802064 on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0d9j6pgcy/)  

**Ease of Use and Dilution**  

A handy feature mentioned in other reviews—and something I wholeheartedly agree with—is how easy the concentrate is to dilute. The bottle even has clear markings for suggested ratios, so you don’t accidentally overuse the product. For daily tasks, a small amount mixed with water goes a long way, significantly stretching its value. Cleaning spray bottles around the house have become a staple, thanks to this mix-it-yourself approach. 

**Strong Points**  
- Recognized by the U.S. EPA Safer Choice Program for safer use.  
- A single product suitable for use on various surfaces, including fabric, tools, and carpets.  
- Concentrated formula provides excellent long-term value.  
- Refreshing sassafras scent without a harsh chemical undertone.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The bottle design might be tricky to handle for those with smaller hands, especially when using the full 64 oz size.  
- As it's a highly concentrated formula, first-timers may find dilution ratios slightly confusing without careful reading.  

**Other Options in the Market**  

When compared to other cleaners like Mr. Clean Multi-Surface Cleaner or Lysol All-Purpose Cleaner, Simple Green stands out for its multi-surface capabilities and eco-friendliness. While competitors often work excellently on specific materials, they fall short on fabrics or outdoor areas. On the other hand, this product has covered nearly all cleaning duties in my home without compromising on quality or safety. However, if a user prioritizes instant spray-and-go convenience over dilution flexibility, some competitors might still hold appeal.   

**Affordable Quality**  

The price-to-quality ratio is incredible with this product. Initially, I felt a sense of hesitation despite all the glowing reviews online, as concentrates can sound daunting. But the ability to use it sparingly and still achieve substantial results makes it worth every penny. It’s a rare blend of economic savings and excellent performance. With one bottle lasting weeks despite consistent use, even individuals on a budget should find this product practical.

1o23alh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o23alh/does_excelpure_cto10_replacement_countertop_water/,Does EXCELPURE CTO10 Replacement Countertop Water Filter Meet Expectations Review Readers Can't Miss?,"Testing the EXCELPURE CTO10-4PACK replacement water filter cartridges for my home has been quite the experience. Crafted to fit most standard countertop and whole-house water filtration systems, these little powerhouses claim to improve water quality significantly. With their food-grade material and certifications like BPA-Free, IAPMO, ROHS, and others, they make a strong case for being safe and reliable. Initially, I was curious whether they would live up to their glowing reviews. My goal was simple: cleaner, better-tasting water for my family, and I dove right in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
These replacement filters feature a compact design measuring just 10 inches in height and 2.5 inches in diameter. At first glance, their minimalist build made installation seem a total breeze. The carbon material feels robust and well-crafted; it’s hard not to notice the sturdy finish. After a couple of test runs in one of my older filtration systems, I appreciated how well they fit without requiring excessive adjustments. For users like me who dread tools and manuals, the “easy-to-install” label wasn’t an exaggeration.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
The EXCELPURE CTO10-4PACK promises to reduce up to 99% of chlorine, sand, rust, and sediment, and so far, it hasn’t disappointed. Within a day of swapping out the old filters, I noticed a marked difference in taste—no lingering chemical aftertaste, just clean, crisp water. Ironically, they made me realize how bad my previous filters were at tackling sediment because my tea and coffee tasted SO much cleaner. A word of caution though: this filter’s efficiency might dip a bit if you’re using well water, as stated in its documentation. City water users like myself should face no issues.

**[Check EXCELPURE CTO10-4PACK price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08xm2pj6n/)**

**Key Benefits**  
- Certified with robust safety standards like EC1935-2004 and BPA-Free compliance.  
- Long-lasting performance with the ability to filter up to 13,000 gallons of water.  
- Significant reduction in chlorine, rust, and sediments, enhancing water quality.  
- Compatible with various standard RO unit filters from brands like DuPont, Whirlpool, and GE.  

**Potential Weaknesses**  
After weeks of daily use, I’ve noticed a couple of things worth pointing out:  
- Users with well water might find it tricky to achieve optimal performance as sediment levels can vary greatly.  
- Although it filters sediment well, extremely particulate or murky water may leave traces until replaced.  
- The lifespan of 13,000 gallons may vary under poor water conditions, reducing value over time.  

**User-Friendliness and Installation**  
Setting these filters up was a joy. Each cartridge is meticulously designed to ensure compatibility with a range of systems. Being someone who barely reads instructions, the process didn’t take me more than ten minutes. Whether you’re replacing an Aquaboon CTO, GE FXWTC, or Whirlpool WHCF-WHWC filter, the interchangeability is seamless. What’s more, the informative labels on the product eliminate most guesswork.

**Competing Products**  
If you’re considering broader options, competitors like the Aquaboon CTO filters and Culligan D-10 models stack up decently. While Aquaboon offers a similarly sturdy design, I found its filtration capacity to be slightly less versatile across city and well water. Culligan D-10 cartridges are more cost-effective, but trade-offs come with longevity concerns; some buyers report quicker wear compared to EXCELPURE. Based on my testing, the EXCELPURE stands out in providing consistent results with fewer replacements down the line, making them worthy contenders in the countertop filtration market.

**Price Worthiness**  
Though pricing fluctuates, the value you get with this 4-pack of cartridges feels very sound for what it offers. Consider the durability, the certifications that ensure safety, and the improved water quality over cheaper alternatives. Even with consistent family usage, the impressive longevity minimizes how often replacements are needed, which translates to real savings over time. For anyone who’s serious about their household water quality, I’d call this an affordable—and arguably smart—investment.

Well, yes, I'm approaching 40 years old. Yes, I have less than $1,000 to my name. Yes, I'm disabled with schizoaffective. Yes, I have yet to fly from my mother's nest.



But what do you mean it's over for me? I'm not sick. I'm not dying. I'm not diagnosed with terminal cancer. Yes, I think I'm eating the worst foods. Yes, I'm isolated. Yes, I think I'm at high risk for developing cancer. But as of my last physical, I'm not diagnosed as having cancer. I'm not diagnosed as having a life-threatening terminal illness.



I'm still performing at a high level. I think there's potential here for me to succeed... really.



And they say, ""Andrew, face it. You're never gonna be a pop superstar. You're never gonna be a movie star. You're never gonna be a millionaire. You're never gonna be a billionaire. Give up the pipe dream and get a realistic job working for minimum wage, stocking shelves, serving coffee as a barista, restaurant waiter, or whatever. Find any job, but a realistic job working 9 to 5, 5 days a week. your middle class existence.""



I'm like, all right, I hear you, but something you don't realize is how anxious and agoraphobic I am when I enter real life.



They say, ""You're not anxious and agoraphobic, Andrew. You go to the gym, you go to the supermarket, you go to an art class.""



No, trust me, I get massive panic attacks. I think everybody's focused on me. I got the spotlight effect. the spotlight syndrome. I think everybody's looking at me, paying attention to me, and basically I just want to hide in my apartment, afraid of the world all day, every day.



They say, ""a girlfriend, friends, a life, maybe not a billionaire life, but a life is, getting off social media, cuz social media is not your ticket to billions of dollars. The opposite is true. It's your ticket to wasting your life. But if you want a life, calm down. Stop being so anxious.""



The thing is, I think everybody's looking at me critically. I feel really self-conscious. I feel inadequate. I feel defective. I feel like everybody can tell how severely mentally ill I am. And I kind of, when I'm in public, I want to shield myself. I want to hide. I feel anxious, self-conscious, defective, damaged, and I just want to hide at home because I'm full of shame. I'm full of embarrassment. I'm full of anxiety. I get panic attacks.



And I'm just wasting my life. But if I can overcome the anxiety, maybe I'm not going to have a superstar lifestyle, but I think I can have a life.",1,1760008794.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

I bought our Elektra Verve mini a year ago and have had the best experience with it so far. I chose the Verve as my first espresso machine, hoping to make just one purchase in my life. My wife and I host very regularly and serve many milky drinks, both coffee-based and tea-based. Personally, we drink filter, espresso and cortados every day so we thought that having a small but powerful machine that matches the aesthetics of the flat was the best option. I did my research, and after speaking with different distributors, I was persuaded to get this one (the functionality and aesthetics played a big role). 

With little experience brewing at home but being a good everyday coffee shop consumer, we had a really enjoyable journey between what we already knew we liked and discovering new ways to get there. We mostly focus on specificity and experimental beans, with occasional nutty, classic dark chocolates. We can brew whatever we want at home.

I love this machine. Paired with the Mazzer Philos, it’s very reliable and delivers back-to-back shots with consistent flavour. As I mentioned, I’ve yet to see another machine like this in this group, so any Verve Mini users are welcome to share your personal experiences.

PS: The only issue I’ve found with the machine is the backflushing system, it seems to get the portafilter stuck. Any advice on that?",20,1760008729.0,espresso,1,0.95,False

I went from being completely anti-social and passive to actively going to the gym, bars, language meetups, dancing, reading, and doing social experiments by approaching people in public. Along the way, I made new friends and had a meaningful relationship that taught me about self-love, boundaries, and positivity. For me, it all comes down to be able to work with yourself and becoming the best version you can be.

I was standing outside a small café, leaning against the wall, smoking just to pass the time.

She came out holding a cup of cold coffee and asked if she could borrow my lighter. I handed it to her, and she lit her cigarette, taking a slow drag before saying thanks. She didn’t look at me right away, just stared at the road like she was somewhere else entirely.

For a while, we stood there side by side in silence. The sound of rickshaws passing, the smell of rain in the air, the faint hum of a song from inside the café it all blended into one quiet moment. Then she asked what song I was listening to. I told her it was an old one from Arctic Monkeys. She smiled faintly and said she used to listen to them when life felt easier.

“When was that?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Maybe never.”

That made me laugh, and she did too. After that, it just flowed. We talked about movies that make you sad, songs that don’t age, and how Dhaka sunsets always look like they’re trying too hard.

Her ride came after a while. She looked at me, smiled again, and said, “Maybe I’ll steal your lighter again sometime.”

“Maybe I’ll let you,” I said.

She got in the car and left. I didn’t ask for her number, and she didn’t offer it. Somehow it felt right that way, like it wasn’t supposed to go beyond that evening.

But every time I pass that café, I still check my pocket for that lighter and wonder if she ever found another quiet evening to share.",5,1760008582.0,Dhaka,2,0.86,False

It happens to be 5 min away from his best friends. We had a good relationship with them and used to visit them a lot on the weekends prior to buying our house. 

After moving in, they started visiting us during the week (and workhours) as we both work from home ( his friend has his own company and wife is SAH mom). They always just showed up, without notice, went to the back door and knocked there. Thats where my desk was, so quite often, when I turned around, someone was looking at me. It made me feel uncomfortable so I started closing the blinds and later moved my desk elsewhere. They also had their coffee right after my back, what was OK at some moments but distracting when I had meetings etc. They also came early on weekends, and we woke up on them knocking on the back door because they want coffee.. 

I asked my boyfriend if he can request that they let us know before they come. We had a fight about it, him telling me no because the dude is his only friend but eventually he communicated it (they didn’t take it well at first) and it got better. 
Of course it started ruining the relationship- because they “didn’t feel welcome at our home”. They also complained I don’t give them any attention when they come.

Fast forward, now they call before they come but my BF invites them for coffee even when I am working ( usually 30 -45 min before I can finish). I asked him, if he can plan it AFTER work as it is annoying for me when I am working ( I don’t work from kitchen anymore, moved my desk 3x to not get disturbed). When they come, I show up and greet them but go back to work. 

I do feel resentment building up towards them as this has been annoying me a long time now and it starts to cause problems at my work ( for example my boss wanted me to come to office as I had a lot of noise in the background during some lecture on a new task). She is not a fan of full time HO and this gives her proof it’s not working well for me. 

I also told him, when they come like this - there is no chance for me to participate and for things to get better . AITAH? What do I do ? ",1,1760008578.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

When are apartments buildings in Lexington supposed to switch over to heat? The chiller is still on here and it's cold in the building, the temperature in my unit is 69 as I'm sitting here writing this. It's even colder than that in the halls and common areas on the residential floors. With lows getting down in the 40s it's going to get even more frigid in the building than it already is if we don't have heat. Please come check this out!

**Traffic light/sign**
I would like to recommend adding a ""No Turn on Red"" sign at the intersection of West Main Street and North Forbes Road. The nearby service road that runs parallel to West Main (at approximately 1397 W Main Street, where Jimmy John’s and other businesses are located) creates a hazardous situation. Vehicles turning left from that service road onto North Forbes must contend with drivers turning right on red from North Forbes onto West Main. This frequent right-on-red movement makes it difficult and unsafe for cars exiting the service road.

I'm 16, from Rautahat - yes, that district everyone jokes about for illiteracy and underdevelopment. I'm Madhesi, Muslim by birth (though I don't really practice - I'm more rationalist/agnostic), and I have what might sound like a crazy dream: **I want to be Nepal's Prime Minister.**

Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.



# Who Am I?

I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: ""This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place."" But my heart couldn't accept it.

I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as ""real Nepalis."" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most ""un-prime-ministerable"" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.

I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.

**I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**

And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.



# My Vision: Nepal 2065

**Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**

**My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**

Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:



# PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled

**The Problem:**

* Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools
* Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated
* Rote learning, no critical thinking
* English weak (we can't compete globally)

**My Solution:**

* **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience)
* **Make teaching prestigious** \- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers
* **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes)
* **World-class facilities** \- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school
* **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private)
* **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes
* **AI-powered personalized learning** \- every student learns at their own pace

**Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class

**Cost:** \~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)

**Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.



# PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal

**The Problem:**

* Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours)
* Electricity cuts (though better now)
* Rural areas isolated
* Kathmandu traffic nightmare

**My Solution:**

**Roads:**

* Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard
* Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains)
* Every village connected with all-weather roads
* **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years

**Railways:**

* Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India)
* Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary)
* **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years
* *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*

**Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**

* Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower
* **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need
* **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \- earn $20-30 billion/year
* Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries
* **Investment:** $40-65 billion
* **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**

**Urban Transit:**

* Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines)
* Modern bus systems in all major cities
* **End traffic hell**

**Internet:**

* High-speed fiber optic everywhere
* 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035
* Enable remote work, online businesses

**Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years



# PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth

**The Problem:**

* Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy)
* Almost no manufacturing
* Youth have no jobs
* Everyone wants to go abroad

**My Solution:**

**Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**

* Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs**
* Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs**
* Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs**
* Target: $15-20 billion exports

**Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**

* **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential**
* Steel production
* Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs**
* Pharmaceuticals
* Target: $50-80 billion exports

**Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**

* IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs**
* AI and software development
* Financial services hub
* Advanced manufacturing
* Target: $150-250 billion exports

**Special Economic Zones:**

* Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure
* Attract foreign investment
* Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)

**Support Small Businesses:**

* Cheap loans (3-5% interest)
* Business training and mentorship
* Remove bureaucratic barriers

**Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services



# PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work

**The Problem (We All Know This):**

* Massive corruption at every level
* Nothing gets done without bribes
* Politicians care about power, not people
* Bureaucracy is nightmare

**My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**

**Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**

* Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)
   * Ministers: $200K-300K/year
   * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year
* But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:
   * Minimum 10 years jail
   * Take all their stolen money + more
   * Lifetime ban from public service
   * Publicize their names (shame them)
* **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power
* Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)

**Transparency:**

* Every rupee of government spending online, trackable
* All government tenders open and transparent
* Officials must declare assets publicly every year

**Meritocracy:**

* Hire best people, not party members or relatives
* Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher)
* Promote based on performance, not seniority
* Fire people who don't perform

**Digital Government:**

* 90% of government services online
* Get licenses, permits in hours, not months
* No need to visit offices and bribe officials

**This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**



# PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation

**The Problem:**

* Government hospitals terrible
* Healthcare expensive
* Rural areas have almost nothing
* People die from preventable diseases

**My Solution:**

**Three-Tier System:**

* **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health)
* **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists)
* **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)

**Universal Health Insurance:**

* Everyone covered from birth
* Poor: 100% government paid
* Middle class: Subsidized
* Rich: Pay themselves
* **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**

**Train More Doctors:**

* Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \~30,000)
* Expand medical schools
* Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad

**Use AI/Technology:**

* AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care)
* Telemedicine (video call with specialists)
* Electronic health records

**Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years

**Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.



# PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper

**The Problem:**

* Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity)
* Farmers are poor despite working hard
* Young people don't want to farm

**My Solution:**

**Modernize:**

* Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized)
* Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040)
* Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training
* Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**

**High-Value Crops:**

* Premium tea and coffee (marketed as ""Himalayan"")
* Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India)
* Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric)
* Medicinal plants
* Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf

**Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)

**Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years



# PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine

**Current:** \~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue

**Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue

**How:**

* Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones)
* Good roads to tourist destinations
* Range of hotels (budget to luxury)
* Safety and cleanliness
* Promote beyond trekking:
   * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)
   * Cultural heritage
   * Adventure sports
   * Wellness/yoga retreats
   * MICE (conferences, business events)

**Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)

**Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years

**Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs



# PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society

**The Problem:**

* Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities)
* Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities)
* Brain drain (educated youth leaving)
* Social tension

**My Solution:**

**Equal Opportunity:**

* Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth)
* Merit-based system everywhere
* Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary)
* All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)

**Gender Equality:**

* Equal pay enforced
* Maternity leave (6-12 months paid)
* Universal childcare (so women can work)
* Safety and protection laws enforced

**Pension and Social Security:**

* Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum)
* Unemployment insurance
* Disability support

**Stop Brain Drain:**

* Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life)
* Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable)
* Make Nepal attractive to live in
* Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)

**National Identity:**

* Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali)
* Respect diversity but build common purpose
* Federal system works (provinces have power)



# THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065

**If we do all this:**

**Economy:**

* GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today)
* Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today)
* **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**

**Quality of Life:**

* Life expectancy: 83-85 years
* Everyone educated to university level
* Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare
* Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages
* Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally

**Global Standing:**

* Top 20-25 economy in the world
* Regional leader (South Asia's success story)
* Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development

**Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more ""I have to leave Nepal to succeed.""



# THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges

**Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.

**Nepal must avoid this:**

* Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances)
* Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women)
* Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking)
* Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population

**Technology opportunities:**

* **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages)
* **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post
* **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming
* **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities
* Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge



# THE COST & FUNDING

**Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years

**Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**

* **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows)
* **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign)
* **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans)
* **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)

**The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**



# THE REAL QUESTION

**Can Nepal really do this?**

**Historically, YES:**

* South Korea: $100 per person (1960) → $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years
* Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) → $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years
* China: $200 per person (1980) → $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years
* Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) → $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years

**What they had in common:**

* Long-term vision
* Investment in education
* Good governance (low corruption)
* Strategic economic policy
* Sustained effort over decades

**Nepal has everything needed:**

* Natural resources (hydropower, tourism)
* Strategic location (between India and China)
* Young population (demographic advantage NOW)
* Democracy (legitimate government)
* Can learn from others' successes and mistakes
* Technology available to leapfrog

**What's missing? Political will and execution.**



# MY COMMITMENT

I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.

1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics
2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations
3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience
4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM)
5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)

**I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**

And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.



# THE FINAL QUESTION (The One That Matters)

**Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim as your Prime Minister?**

I'm not asking you to vote for me now - I'm 16, that would be weird.

I'm asking: **If someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone from a Muslim family (even though I'm not religious), came to you in 20-30 years with this vision, this plan, this commitment - would you give them a chance?**

Or would you say: ""No, PM must be Bahun/Chhetri from Kathmandu hills""?

Because honestly, that's what I'm most afraid of. Not that the plan is hard (it is, but doable). Not that it costs too much (it's affordable). Not that Nepal can't do it (we absolutely can).

**I'm afraid that Nepal will reject good leadership because of caste, ethnicity, religion.**

I want to believe we're better than that. Gen Z is showing we can be better than that.

So tell me honestly:

**Would you accept a PM who is:**

* Madhesi (from Terai, not hills)
* Muslim by birth (though rationalist/agnostic in belief)
* From Rautahat (most backward district)
* But has the vision, knowledge, and commitment to make Nepal developed?

**Or would you prefer:**

* Traditional hill elite
* ""Right"" caste and religion
* From ""right"" family
* But continuing same old politics that kept us poor for 70 years?



# Why I'm Posting This

I know I sound crazy. I know I'm just a kid. I know the odds are against me.

But someone has to say this. Someone has to have the audacity to dream that Nepal can be great. Someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone Muslim has to stand up and say: **""I refuse to accept that we're destined to be poor. I refuse to accept that I have to leave Nepal to succeed. I refuse to accept that my identity disqualifies me from serving my nation.""**

If you think this vision is stupid, tell me why (genuinely - I want to learn).

If you think it's impossible, show me what I'm missing.

If you think someone like me can never be PM because of where I'm from, at least be honest about it.

But if you think - even a little bit - that this could work, that Nepal deserves better, that maybe, just maybe, we should judge leaders by their vision and ability rather than their last name and birthplace...

**Then let's start a conversation.**

Because real change doesn't start in Singha Durbar. It starts in conversations like this.



**धन्यवाद for reading this essay. I know it's long. But Nepal's future is worth a long post.**

**Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim PM? Would you accept THIS vision for Nepal?**

**Let's discuss. सत्यवाकन् धर्मचारी (Truth and righteousness) - that's what Nepal needs, regardless of who brings it.**



*P.S. - To those who'll say ""just another kid dreaming, will forget in 2 years"": Maybe. But every leader who transformed their nation started by dreaming when young. Lee Kuan Yew was 35 when he became PM. Obama was community organizer in his 20s. Balen was just engineer before he became mayor. You have to dream before you can build.*

*P.P.S. - Yes, I know $3-4 trillion sounds insane when we're at $40 billion now. But Korea went from $4 billion to $1.6 trillion (400x) in 60 years. Nepal going from $40B to $3T (75x) in 40 years with modern technology? Actually conservative.*

*P.P.P.S. - If you're from Rautahat or Madhesi community or any minority - this post is especially for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong in Nepal's future. We belong just as much as anyone else. Maybe even more, because we know what it's like to be left behind.*

Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.



# Who Am I?

I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: ""This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place."" But my heart couldn't accept it.

I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as ""real Nepalis."" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most ""un-prime-ministerable"" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.

I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.

**I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**

And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.



# My Vision: Nepal 2065

**Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**

**My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**

Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:



# PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled

**The Problem:**

* Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools
* Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated
* Rote learning, no critical thinking
* English weak (we can't compete globally)

**My Solution:**

* **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience)
* **Make teaching prestigious** \- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers
* **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes)
* **World-class facilities** \- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school
* **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private)
* **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes
* **AI-powered personalized learning** \- every student learns at their own pace

**Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class

**Cost:** \~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)

**Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.



# PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal

**The Problem:**

* Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours)
* Electricity cuts (though better now)
* Rural areas isolated
* Kathmandu traffic nightmare

**My Solution:**

**Roads:**

* Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard
* Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains)
* Every village connected with all-weather roads
* **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years

**Railways:**

* Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India)
* Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary)
* **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years
* *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*

**Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**

* Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower
* **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need
* **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \- earn $20-30 billion/year
* Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries
* **Investment:** $40-65 billion
* **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**

**Urban Transit:**

* Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines)
* Modern bus systems in all major cities
* **End traffic hell**

**Internet:**

* High-speed fiber optic everywhere
* 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035
* Enable remote work, online businesses

**Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years



# PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth

**The Problem:**

* Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy)
* Almost no manufacturing
* Youth have no jobs
* Everyone wants to go abroad

**My Solution:**

**Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**

* Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs**
* Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs**
* Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs**
* Target: $15-20 billion exports

**Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**

* **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential**
* Steel production
* Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs**
* Pharmaceuticals
* Target: $50-80 billion exports

**Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**

* IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs**
* AI and software development
* Financial services hub
* Advanced manufacturing
* Target: $150-250 billion exports

**Special Economic Zones:**

* Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure
* Attract foreign investment
* Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)

**Support Small Businesses:**

* Cheap loans (3-5% interest)
* Business training and mentorship
* Remove bureaucratic barriers

**Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services



# PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work

**The Problem (We All Know This):**

* Massive corruption at every level
* Nothing gets done without bribes
* Politicians care about power, not people
* Bureaucracy is nightmare

**My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**

**Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**

* Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)
   * Ministers: $200K-300K/year
   * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year
* But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:
   * Minimum 10 years jail
   * Take all their stolen money + more
   * Lifetime ban from public service
   * Publicize their names (shame them)
* **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power
* Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)

**Transparency:**

* Every rupee of government spending online, trackable
* All government tenders open and transparent
* Officials must declare assets publicly every year

**Meritocracy:**

* Hire best people, not party members or relatives
* Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher)
* Promote based on performance, not seniority
* Fire people who don't perform

**Digital Government:**

* 90% of government services online
* Get licenses, permits in hours, not months
* No need to visit offices and bribe officials

**This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**



# PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation

**The Problem:**

* Government hospitals terrible
* Healthcare expensive
* Rural areas have almost nothing
* People die from preventable diseases

**My Solution:**

**Three-Tier System:**

* **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health)
* **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists)
* **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)

**Universal Health Insurance:**

* Everyone covered from birth
* Poor: 100% government paid
* Middle class: Subsidized
* Rich: Pay themselves
* **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**

**Train More Doctors:**

* Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \~30,000)
* Expand medical schools
* Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad

**Use AI/Technology:**

* AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care)
* Telemedicine (video call with specialists)
* Electronic health records

**Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years

**Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.



# PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper

**The Problem:**

* Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity)
* Farmers are poor despite working hard
* Young people don't want to farm

**My Solution:**

**Modernize:**

* Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized)
* Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040)
* Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training
* Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**

**High-Value Crops:**

* Premium tea and coffee (marketed as ""Himalayan"")
* Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India)
* Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric)
* Medicinal plants
* Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf

**Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)

**Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years



# PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine

**Current:** \~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue

**Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue

**How:**

* Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones)
* Good roads to tourist destinations
* Range of hotels (budget to luxury)
* Safety and cleanliness
* Promote beyond trekking:
   * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)
   * Cultural heritage
   * Adventure sports
   * Wellness/yoga retreats
   * MICE (conferences, business events)

**Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)

**Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years

**Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs



# PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society

**The Problem:**

* Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities)
* Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities)
* Brain drain (educated youth leaving)
* Social tension

**My Solution:**

**Equal Opportunity:**

* Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth)
* Merit-based system everywhere
* Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary)
* All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)

**Gender Equality:**

* Equal pay enforced
* Maternity leave (6-12 months paid)
* Universal childcare (so women can work)
* Safety and protection laws enforced

**Pension and Social Security:**

* Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum)
* Unemployment insurance
* Disability support

**Stop Brain Drain:**

* Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life)
* Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable)
* Make Nepal attractive to live in
* Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)

**National Identity:**

* Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali)
* Respect diversity but build common purpose
* Federal system works (provinces have power)



# THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065

**If we do all this:**

**Economy:**

* GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today)
* Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today)
* **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**

**Quality of Life:**

* Life expectancy: 83-85 years
* Everyone educated to university level
* Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare
* Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages
* Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally

**Global Standing:**

* Top 20-25 economy in the world
* Regional leader (South Asia's success story)
* Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development

**Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more ""I have to leave Nepal to succeed.""



# THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges

**Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.

**Nepal must avoid this:**

* Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances)
* Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women)
* Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking)
* Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population

**Technology opportunities:**

* **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages)
* **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post
* **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming
* **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities
* Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge



# THE COST & FUNDING

**Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years

**Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**

* **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows)
* **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign)
* **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans)
* **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)

**The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**



# THE REAL QUESTION

**Can Nepal really do this?**

**Historically, YES:**

* South Korea: $100 per person (1960) → $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years
* Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) → $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years
* China: $200 per person (1980) → $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years
* Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) → $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years

**What they had in common:**

* Long-term vision
* Investment in education
* Good governance (low corruption)
* Strategic economic policy
* Sustained effort over decades

**Nepal has everything needed:**

* Natural resources (hydropower, tourism)
* Strategic location (between India and China)
* Young population (demographic advantage NOW)
* Democracy (legitimate government)
* Can learn from others' successes and mistakes
* Technology available to leapfrog

**What's missing? Political will and execution.**



# MY COMMITMENT

I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.

**My plan:**

1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics
2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations
3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience
4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM)
5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)

**I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**

And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.

We were group of three girls. It’s been a year and I had very hard time adapting this because it wasn’t out of nowhere but also it could’ve solved with face to face talking. But there was some heated argument between her and our other friend and she left the group chat. After that she posted a story on instagram and called us some unforgivable stuff. And after that she blocked both of us. I was kinda like the middle man but I sided with our other friend because in my opinion our other friend was doing things for her well being. 

This year (two weeks ago) we came across at the bus stop. Our universities so close to each other 5 minutes by walking and we apparently use the same bus stop. It was the first time that we saw each other since the fight. A week later since we saw each other first time over a year I saw her WhatsApp story. (If you don’t know you can see someone’s WhatsApp story if you have each other’s phone number otherwise you can’t see)

I didn’t block her because she had been already blocked me. I didn’t delete her number because I was being lazy. Does she trying to reconnect or reach out or something? Or am I reading too much into things?

Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss. 

“Mia, sit down,” her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

“Can’t this wait? I have work,” Mia replied, her voice tight. “I can’t afford to be late again.”

Her mother raised an eyebrow. “Work? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.”

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn’t just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

“What’s this about, Mom?” Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary’s lips curled into a smile. “We have good news.”

Mia blinked, skeptical. “Good news?”

“Yes!” Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. “I got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!”

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party—the most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful—was as far removed from her world as the moon.

“And this is good news… how?” Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

“Attending will be nice though,” Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

“Nice?!” Lily’s voice rose an octave. “Do you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!”

“And how did your name end up on the list?” Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

“Connections,” Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn’t want to dig deeper into what kind of “connections” her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn’t be pleasant.

“Okay, so Lily’s going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?” Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn’t afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. “This is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.”

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother’s schemes. Everything in Mary Turner’s life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

“I’m happy for Lily,” Mia said flatly, rising to leave. “Congratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.”

“Sit down, Mia,” Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

“I can’t be late—”

“Sit!”

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

“Listen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever”

“ How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?”

“You wish…” Lily said with snort. “ No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face”

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

“Lily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family” Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

“Eww, don't say it like that you're my brother” Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

“Did I mention she is the most stupid?”

“I try”

“Enough both of you” Mary scolds

“I seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me”

“Always so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?” Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

“At least I’m doing something!” Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary’s phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. “Same time, same place, Barry? I’ll be there,” she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn’t need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother’s usual business—entertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. “The point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.”

“This is ridiculous mom! Count me out,” Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.”

“I don't have have money”

“Yes you do” Anna rushed to say. “You've been saving a lot of money for college.”

“Like you said college”

“This is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College” Mary says, checking her phone.

“ And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life”

“So you think you're better than us now?”

“Oh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money”

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

“Oh you're a Turner, never mind”

“You're a Turner you have no say”

“Girl you're a Turner”

“You're Turner Shut up and open your legs”

“Not a Turner trying to form modesty”

# Chosen For The Game

Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn’t on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington—his girlfriend—he tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn’t supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe’s birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted—most of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him—Dickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn’t bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren’t ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

“You don’t even get jealous anymore,” she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. “What do you want me to do, break some poor guy’s nose?”

Her pout deepened. “When did you even start caring about people?”

“I don’t.”

“Exactly my point!” She crossed her arms, glaring. “You’re so… boring now.”

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

“Man, why would you employ a Turner?”

“She's pretty”

“Still a Turner”

“Won't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick”

“Seriously?”

“Come on I want to have a taste of all of them”

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

“I feel like our spark is dying.”

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. “You say that every day, babe.”

“I mean it this time. I think we need… more games.”

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. “Games? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What’s left?”

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. “I want us to go extreme this time.”

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. “You’re insane.”

“We both are.” She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. “What’s your big idea this time?”

“We break up for a month,” she began, her smile widening. “We each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.”

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. “You’ve officially lost it.”

“Oh, come on! It’ll be fun,” Zoe pressed. “It’s not like we don’t always find our way back to each other.”

“And what’s the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?”

“To spice up our relationship!” she said as though it were obvious. “And—” she added with a wink—“you’ll be saying no to my birthday present if you don’t agree.”

“Thought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?” he drawled.

She waved it off. “Changed my mind.”

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. “Fine.”

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. “Thank you, baby!”

“I’m already regretting this,” he muttered against her lips.

“Okay, okay, let’s pick!” Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. “Not her. Not her. Oh—her!”

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

“A Turner?” he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. “Yup. I heard she’s different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.”

Alexander shook his head firmly. “I’m not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.”

“But she’s pretty,” Zoe argued.

“She’s still a Turner.”

“Alex, please?”

“No Zoe I’m not putting my dick into a Turner “

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. “Fine. If you’re not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday’s ruined.”

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They’d grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn’t imagine life without her.

“Fine,” he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. “Yes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.”

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy—a local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. “Him.”

Zoe frowned. “Jeremy? Isn’t he getting married next month?”

“Even better,” Alexander replied smoothly. “Like you said, the game is sweeter if it’s harder to achieve.”

Zoe grinned. “You’re twisted, Alex.”

“I’m a Blackwell babes ?”

# The Proposal

Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered. 

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn’t deal with them today—not with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.  

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.  

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.  

Mia’s breath caught in her throat.  

He wasn’t just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.  

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.  

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.  

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‘a Blackwell’ couldn’t be talking to her.  

""I’m talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.  

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""  

""Yup.""  

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he’d just announced the sky was green. ""Why… why are you talking to me?""  

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""  

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.  

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""  

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""  

The casual way he said it made her feel like she’d stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.  

""I don’t understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.  

""How much?""  

Mia blinked again. ""What?""  

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""  

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You… you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""  

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.  

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. “ You don’t even know my name!""  

""I know enough, Turner."" 

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.  

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""  

""I said no.""  

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""  

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don’t even know me. You’ve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to—what?—buy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""  

""Don’t tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.  

""You wish,"" she snapped.  

""Trust me, that can’t be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""  

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can’t just buy people to go on dates with you. I’m not interested.""  

Alexander’s smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You’re a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""  

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.  

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""  

Mia’s eyes widened. ""What?""  

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""  

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.  

“What the hell?”

# The Tempting Offer

Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he’d looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer—5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.  

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge. 

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest. 

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts. 

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn’t willing to pull. 

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low. 

“There's no way it’s real,” Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.  

“It could be,” Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “People are saying it all over town.”  

“What’s going on?” Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. “Where’s Mom?”  

“Out. Probably won’t be back until God knows when,” Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.  

“You’re delusional if you think they’ve broken up,” Lily said, laughing. “Zoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.”  

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.  

“Or maybe he broke up with her,” Anna said with a sly smile.  

Lily snorted. “Oh my God, Anna, don’t tell me you’re still holding onto the hope that you’ll get him one day. It’s embarrassing at this point.”  

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.  

“I’m not delusional!” Anna snapped. “And you’re one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who’s too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.”  

“‘Tried’ is an understatement,” Lily said, cackling. “Walking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.”  

Anna’s face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.  

“Face it, Anna. We’re Turners. The Blackwells doesn’t even look at us like we’re human. They hate our family’s existence.”  

“Whatever,” Anna huffed, crossing her arms.  

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice. 

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:  

\*\*Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.\*\*  

Mia’s heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they’d decided to take a “break” to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.  

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he’d approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to… what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?  

She shook her head.

She couldn’t let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.  

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.  

The message was from an unknown number.  

Good morning, Turner. Don’t bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.  

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.  

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.  

Fifteen thousand dollars.  

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh. 

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell’s smirk flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.  

Three days

# The Blackwells

The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors. 

The house was grand—but it felt nothing like a home. 

Dinner here wasn’t about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well… them, and Zoe.  

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.  

“What’s this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?” his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.  

Alex didn’t falter, didn’t blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. “Good evening, Father,” he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.  

“Did you ice that cut, darling?” His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.  

Alex waved her off. “It’s fine, Mother.”  

“I can’t believe you let a rookie do that to you,” Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.  

“I won, Father,” Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. “That’s what matters, isn’t it?”  

Charles’s lips curled into a snarl. “You think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you’re moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!”  

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. “And yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.”  

Charles’s gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian’s wrist and slammed it onto the table.  

Alex stiffened.  

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex’s stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.  

Charles Blackwell wasn’t a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.  

“Do you think this is a game, Alexander?” Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian’s hand.  

Julian’s eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn’t cry out. He never did. 

Once, Julian had been Alex’s hero—the older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.’  

Alex’s jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother’s wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.  

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. “I’ll handle the investors,” he said, his words precise and deliberate. “It won’t affect the meeting. You’ll get the contract.”  

Charles finally let go of Julian’s hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. “Good. That’s what I like to hear.”  

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn’t say a word.  

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn’t. That’s what Charles wanted—to provoke him, to control him.  

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.  

“Fix whatever mess you’ve made with Zoe,” Charles added, his tone icy. “Her father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won’t have your antics ruining our alliance.”  

Alex smirked, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Of course, Father,” he said, not looking up. He couldn’t exactly tell Charles the truth” 

His mind drift to that server girl 

Turner—the fiery server girl who’d told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would’ve jumped at his offer, yet she’d turned him down without a second thought.  

Something about her had gotten under his skin.  

“Did you hear me, Alexander?” Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.  

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. “Loud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.”  

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.  

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket.  

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.  

‘I’ll do it.’

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn’t move, didn’t breathe.  

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

# Let The Game Begin

The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.  

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don’t ruin the fun.""  

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can’t believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.  

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.  

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where’s the challenge in that?""  

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I’d sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to—the one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""  

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it’s not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""  

Alex’s expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""  

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit—watching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""  

Alex didn’t respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.  

—

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she’d last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn’t sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn’t normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn’t need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn’t alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn’t hear. But Alex’s gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

“Tomorrow after work,” Alex said, his voice low and smooth. “I’ll pick you up.”

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

“What was that about?” Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

“Nothing,” Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. “Nothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn’t just walk up to people, Mia.”

“Drop it,” Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn’t look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.

Oh God what did I get myself into....

## Quick Summary

**Here are the top 7 weight loss snacks with their unique properties and usefulness:**

**1\. \*\*Best lowest calorie snack\*\*: Sugar-free jelly/gelatin (with or without fruit - can be as low as 1 cal per 100g!)**

The high water content creates a filling sensation while delivering virtually no calories. Adding fresh berries can provide nutrients and fiber without significantly increasing the calorie count, making it perfect for intense sweet cravings. There is a bundle of 8 different flavors from Jell-O.

**2\. \*\*Best hunger-busting snack\*\*: Air-popped popcorn (no butter)**

The high volume-to-calorie ratio makes popcorn exceptionally filling despite being low in calories (around 30-50 calories per cup). The fiber content slows digestion while the satisfying crunch and ability to season with various spices makes it versatile for both savory and sweet cravings.

**3\. \*\*Best portable protein snack\*\*: Hard-boiled eggs**

At just 70 calories with 6 grams of complete protein, hard-boiled eggs provide exceptional satiety and muscle-preserving nutrients. They're perfectly portion-controlled by nature and can be prepared in batches for grab-and-go convenience throughout the week.

**4\. \*\*Best craving-killer snack\*\*: Dried seaweed snacks**

At just 30 calories per package, seaweed satisfies cravings for something savory, salty and crunchy while providing iodine and other minerals. The umami flavor is particularly satisfying for those who typically crave chips or savory junk foods.

**5\. \*\*Best versatile fiber snack\*\*: Cucumber with lime and tajin**

Provides substantial volume with minimal calories (about 15 calories per cup) while offering versatility in preparation. The high water content (96%) promotes hydration, while the tangy-spicy seasoning satisfies taste buds without added calories or sugar.

**6\. \*\*Best sweet tooth satisfier\*\*: Frozen grapes**

When frozen, grapes transform into mini sorbet-like treats with concentrated sweetness that takes longer to eat. The frozen texture slows consumption, allowing your body to register fullness while the natural sweetness satisfies dessert cravings for around 60 calories per cup.

**7\. \*\*Best pre-portioned snack\*\*: Quest protein cookies (around 90-200 calories)**

These offer the taste and texture of regular cookies while providing 10+ grams of protein and minimal sugar and carbs. The protein content promotes satiety while the sweet taste satisfies cravings, all in a convenient pre-portioned package that removes the guesswork.

**8\. Best value for money/cheapest among commercial products: Great Value Ultra Thin Salty Pretzel Sticks (1.2 calories each stick )**

At just 1.2 calories per stick and typically around \$2 per 16oz bag of 94 sticks, these pretzel sticks deliver exceptional snacking value while satisfying salt cravings. Their thin, crispy texture creates a satisfying crunch with minimal calories, and a single bag provides dozens of snacking sessions without breaking your budget or calorie bank.

## The Truth About Snacking and Weight Loss

Let's address some misconceptions:

- **Is snacking bad for weight loss?** Not inherently! While some argue that ""the best snacks are no snacks,"" this is highly individual. For many people, strategic snacking helps control hunger, maintain energy, and prevent overeating at meals.
- **The golden rule**: The best weight loss snacks are ones that fit into your daily calorie goals while satisfying hunger, cravings, and nutritional needs.
- **Individual differences matter**: What works for one person may not work for another. Some people do better with intermittent fasting approaches, while others need regular fuel throughout the day.
- **Sustainability is key**: If your ""diet"" feels like punishment, you won't stick with it. Finding snacks you genuinely enjoy is crucial for long-term success.

**How to Choose Weight-Loss Friendly Snacks**

The best weight loss snacks generally have these qualities:

- **Portion-controlled**: Pre-portioned or easily measured
- **Protein and/or fiber-rich**: For better satiety
- **Nutrient-dense**: Giving you nutritional bang for your calorie buck
- **Satisfying**: Addresses your specific hunger or craving
- **Convenient**: Realistic for your lifestyle

## Fruit Options: Nature's Candy

Fruits often get unfairly labeled as ""too high in sugar,"" but they're packed with fiber, water, vitamins, and minerals. They're nature's perfect snack packages:

- **Berry options**:
  - Blueberries
  - Strawberries
  - Raspberries (pro tip: try with a square of dark chocolate!)
- **Citrus fruits**:
  - Clementines (perfect portable option)
  - Oranges
- **Core fruits**:
  - Apples (particularly Honeycrisp or Granny Smith with a bit of peanut butter)
  - Pears
- **Melons**:
  - Watermelon (extremely high water content, very filling for calories)
  - Cantaloupe
  - Honeydew
- **Other fruits**:
  - Bananas (more calorie-dense but great pre-workout)
  - Grapes (try frozen for a refreshing treat)
  - Plums
  - Pineapple

## Veggie Snacks: Maximum Volume, Minimum Calories

Vegetables are the ultimate weight loss hack - high volume, low calories, loads of nutrients:

- **Raw veggies**:
  - Bell peppers (all colors)
  - Carrots
  - Celery (try with almond butter, cottage cheese, or a bit of cream cheese)
  - Cherry tomatoes
  - Cucumber (plain or with lime and tajin for a flavor kick)
- **Prepared veggie snacks**:
  - Air-fried vegetables with seasonings
  - Baked kale chips
  - Dried seaweed snacks (extremely low calorie)
  - Pickles and pickled vegetables (virtually no calories, satisfies salt cravings)
  - Veggies Made Great Spinach Egg White Frittata (70 cal)

## Protein-Packed Options: Satiety Superstars

Protein helps keep you full longer and preserves muscle mass during weight loss:

- **Dairy protein**:
  - Cheese sticks (Sargento Sharp Cheddar: 90 cal, Reduced Fat: 45 cal)
  - Cottage cheese (plain or with fruit, try mixing with feta for a flavor boost)
  - Greek yogurt (Oikos Triple Zero: 90 cal)
  - String cheese
- **Meat proteins**:
  - 70-calorie tuna pouches
  - Beef/turkey jerky (watch sodium)
  - Bernard Matthews Turkey slices
  - Chomp sticks
  - Hard-boiled eggs
  - Turkey ham
- **Plant proteins**:
  - Almonds (portion-controlled, about 1oz)
  - Hummus (homemade for best nutrition: chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice)
  - Nuts (pre-portioned)
  - Pumpkin seeds
  - Sunflower seeds
  - Tzatziki dip (yogurt-based alternative to hummus)

## My Personal Insights on Snacking for Weight Loss

After working with hundreds of clients, I've found these strategies make the biggest difference:

- **Pre-portion everything**: Don't eat from the bag/container
- **Preparation is key**: Cut veggies, boil eggs, etc. in advance so they're ready when you're hungry
- **Experiment with timing**: Some do better with 3 meals, others with 5-6 smaller meals/snacks
- **Address the real need**: Sometimes you're not hungry but thirsty, bored, or tired
- **Plan for your cravings**: If you know you crave something sweet after dinner, budget for it!

## Smart Carb Choices: Satisfying Without Sabotaging

Carbs aren't the enemy - but choosing the right ones in appropriate portions makes all the difference:

- **Popcorn varieties**:
  - Air-popped (no butter)
  - Boom Chika Popcorn (light kettle corn - 35 cals/cup)
  - Skinny Pop
  - Sweet and salted popcorn (in moderation)
- **Crackers and crisps**:
  - Carr's table water crackers
  - Great Value Ultra Thin Salty Pretzel Sticks (just 1.2 cals each!)
  - Pombears
  - Puft Hulahoops
  - Rice cakes (plain, caramel, or apple cinnamon - Quaker ones range 35-50 calories)
  - Triscuts
- **Other carb options**:
  - Konjac rice/jelly (extremely low calorie)
  - Low-carb tortilla with a little butter & cinnamon sugar
  - Microwave oat sachets (plain)
  - Wholemeal toast with a small amount of topping

## Sweet Treats That Won't Derail Your Goals

Everyone has sweet cravings - having options that satisfy without blowing your calorie budget is essential:

- **Chocolate options**:
  - Dark chocolate (small portion with raspberries)
  - Chocolate chips (pre-counted portion to enjoy slowly)
  - Quest chocolate cookies (90 cals)
- **Frozen treats**:
  - Aldeen fudge bars (100 cal)
  - Carb Smart fudge bars
  - Costco fudge bars
  - Twix ice cream bars (160 cal) - higher calorie but can fit in budget
  - Yasso yogurt bars
- **Other sweet options**:
  - Cereal bars (check labels for calories)
  - Fiber One Chocolate Brownie (70 cal)
  - Honey sticks (50 cal each)
  - Light hot chocolate
  - Milkybar minis
  - Skinny Whip bars
  - Sugar-free canned peaches/pears
  - Sugar-free jelly/gelatin (with or without fruit - can be as low as 1 cal per 100g!)

## Convenient Store-Bought Options

For busy days when preparation isn't possible:

- **Protein-focused products**:
  - Quest products (bars, cookies, etc.)
  - Protein bars (various brands, aim for <200 calories with at least 10g protein)
  - Protein yogurts
- **Ready-to-eat options**:
  - Baby food fruit and vegetable pouches (about 60 calories, convenient)
  - Miso soup packets
  - Naked Noodle ramen soups (lower calorie versions)
  - Sugar-free jelly pots

## Controversial Snack Categories

Some snacks divide opinion in the weight loss community:

- **""Diet"" versions of junk food**:
  - 28 grams of Doritos
  - Small portions of traditional snack foods

**My take**: While these can work calorie-wise, they often don't provide much nutrition and can trigger cravings for more. Some people do fine with them while others find they lead to binges. Know yourself!

- **Fruit - good or bad?**

**My take**: The ""fruit has too much sugar"" argument is overblown for most people. Whole fruits come packaged with fiber, water, and nutrients. Very few people become overweight from eating too much fruit! Berries are particularly weight-loss friendly due to high fiber and lower sugar content.

## Hydration Options

Sometimes what feels like hunger is actually thirst:

- 8 oz of water (try with lemon or cucumber slice)
- Powerade Zero
- Tea or coffee (without added sugar/cream).

## Building Weight-Loss Friendly Snack Combinations

Creating balanced snack combos can provide better satiety:

- **Protein + produce combinations**:
  - Apple with 1 tbsp peanut butter
  - Celery with cottage cheese and feta
  - Celery with cream cheese
  - Greek yogurt with berries
  - Hard-boiled egg with cherry tomatoes
  - Rice cakes topped with Greek yogurt and fruit
- **Savory combinations**:
  - Brie on table water cracker with fig spread (higher calorie but satisfying)
  - Chips and salsa (portion control is key)
  - Cracker barrel cheese with Triscuits
  - Rice crackers with hummus or pesto
  - Turkey slices wrapped around cheese stick",1,1760007391.0,NoFriendsFriendsClub,0,1.0,False

While money is most important aspect, that alone can’t guarantee a good life after FIRE. Based on my personal experience (I FIREd this year) and my interactions with FIRE aspirants (both online & offline), I have come to a conclusion that FIRE is not for everyone. It only works for people who meet certain criteria and for others RE can make their lives miserable. So first of all, I just want to call out that FIRE is not for you if:

1. **You are enjoying your work** – This is self-explanatory. Activities you pursue post-FIRE may not bring same kind of joy.
2. **You are not sure what you want from life** – I find many people falling in this category. One day they talk about peaceful/slow life and the very next day they are eyeing a luxury car/expensive phone/exotic vacation. If you are someone who easily get attracted towards any flashy object then no amount of money is going to be enough.
3. **You enjoy people appreciating you because of your position** – Oh boy, you are going to miss this so hard. Once you leave that job with VP/Director/Principal title, you are just an ordinary fellow and your fans would suddenly disappear.
4. **You don’t have any hobbies** – This is not a dealbreaker if at least you have a clear plan to pursue some hobbies. But a head start before RE definitely helps.
5. **Household chores are beneath you** – Apart from hobbies, there are many household chores to keep yourself occupied. If you have no hobbies and you don’t even like that grocery run then you might get bored as hell!!

On the other hand, you might be a good FIRE candidate if:

1. **Your hobbies/interests require more time but less money** – Please stay away from FIRE if your hobby is to collect every latest gadget.
2. **You enjoy small things** – A walk in the nature, brewing your coffee etc.
3. **You are open to learn new things** – Learning a musical instrument or sport with no prior experience.
4. **You have non-monetary life goals** – My list includes a trek to EBC & international road trip.
5. **You have a spiritual inclination** – This I have realized lately. I am able to meditate better and read the books I always wanted to.",25,1760007363.0,FIRE_Ind,8,0.9,False

Reason behind every choice

Avvatar – My most preferred one because of its quality and taste. I absolutely love the Cafe Mocha Swirl flavor, it tastes just like coffee with milk. The whey quality is top notch, and I genuinely trust this brand. (Basically, I use it on a regular basis.)

MuscleBlaze – Good enough in terms of both quality and flavor (Blue Tokai). Got it for around ₹2k per kg, so overall a pretty decent deal.

Yogabar Whey – The fact that it’s naturally sweetened and was available at a steal deal made it an easy choice. Normally, the monk fruit sweetened version sells for much higher.

Yogabar Protein Shake (Cold Coffee) – Travel-friendly and super convenient, but the main highlight is the taste, it’s honestly too good. The price was also quite reasonable.


Note: I know there were way better and cheaper deals available, but I intentionally skipped those. I chose what I actually wanted to order, things I personally prefer rather than just chasing discounts and making choices purely based on price.

1o22nr4,https://i.redd.it/ddqtjwylf2uf1.png,Prison Project | Her Eyes Darted Back Towards the Librarian,"# Chapter 1 - The Plan



Cara frantically glanced up to the wall clock, before her eyes darted back towards the librarian who had been watching us both like a hawk since the moment we had first sat down... 



""We only have ten minutes left to submit yours before she kicks us out for the day!"" Cara breathes, having roped me in on another one of her wild ideas as she always did. 



Sighing, I nod along with her, watching her click yes to give my permission to an endless list of terms and conditions that neither of us had bothered to read for the second time today... 



""The deadline is at midnight tonight, so we are probably too late on sending these in! They've no doubt already picked out who they want for this Cara - I don't imagine the government would leave such decisions to the very last minute, do you?"" I complain, knowing that the idea had been a ridiculous one right from the very start. 



Shipping ourselves off to spend some one on one time with maximum security prisoners as a new form of rehabilitation? 



Sure thing. 



But why would I ever even agree to this, you ask? Well because it obviously isn't for free! 



Having just finished school, struggling for jobs in our shit little home town filled with nothing other than farms, motels and dusty mines, Cara had found this bizarre advert posted up last week when we had been scrolling online - while using our one hour of free WiFi that we got in the public library every week... 



'Females wanted for prisoner coupling - $25,000 reward on completion' 



I had almost choked on my own saliva when Cara said she wanted to sign us both up, adding that the grand total for us combined would be $50,000...



But dare I admit that as the days passed, she had successfully managed to talk me around on the idea - listing a number of ways in which the money would change our lives!



No more drunk and toxic fathers, no more having to live in a damp little trailer and no more living without a purpose... 



""Ok, I'm almost there, we have about four minutes left before she cuts us off!"" Cara hums out, wriggling slightly on the computer chair to lean in even closer to the screen... 



She pushed a clump of her thick blonde hair back from her face, as I watch her proceed to uploading the digital photo we had both taken of each other on an old camera she had found in a box back home that surprisingly still worked. 



The pictures weren't the best quality, but dare I admit that we had somehow managed to scrub up well enough to make ourselves look somewhat presentable... 



I leaned back from my position to glance at the librarian, her age showing through the way she would peer over at us from above her glasses - an upset frown taking over her entire face as if wrinkled and creased. 



Why the heck did she hate us so much anyway?! 



We had tried to be polite to her on numerous occasions, but had quickly learned that unless we were a young, attractive guy, then she wasn't at all interested! 



One time, I even recall a guy coming in to use the internet just as we had, and when it came to being time up, she only shooed us away - stating that he would get longer because whatever he was doing 'seemed important'. 



Shaking my head at the memory, and refocusing my attention back on Cara, I watched as she clicked the final confirmation button as a 'Successfully Submitted' tab popped up in bold letters on the screen, before the librarian cleared her throat loudly from across the room. 



We've evidently overstayed our welcome. 



Again.



""Alright, alright, we're done, Jesus you would think you were the one paying the damn electric bills for this place!"" Cara mutters out under her breath, slamming the laptop shut with a little more force than what was necessary.



I exhale and rub my temples. ""Cara wait, this is actually insane. What if they pick us for this?""



Cara beams at me, her eyes twinkling at the thought. ""Then we pack our damn bags as quick as we can and kiss this place goodbye!"" 



I roll my eyes but don't argue with my own insecurities. It's easier to let her have her fantasies, since the whole thing felt way too good to be true anyhow. 



What are the odds that we'd actually be chosen for something as important as this? A new idea to reform dangerous criminals, and to think they could be trusting the likes of us to help them? There was no way! 



We both make a move to shuffle out of the library, not bothering to say a goodbye as we pass the desk - knowing that we would be lucky for a grunt in response on the best of days... 



The summer air was heavy with the scent of dust and gasoline from the nearby highway filling our lungs as we stepped out on to the gravel. 



The reality of our miserable life here squashed down on me like it always does — the endless cycle of dead-end jobs and the suffocating predictability of it all.



What would we become staying here in town? Perhaps a drunk? Or maybe pregnant to some deadbeat guy with no ambitions, leading to a miserable life of struggle? The options were slim, and all of them were horrific. 



Cara loops her arm through mine as we begin our walk back to the trailer park on the opposite side of town. ""You'll thank me for this when we're rolling in the cash - trust me."" She giggles, as I shake my head at her. 



""Yeah if we make it out of there alive you mean? Besides, like I said, it's probably too late for us to join up!"" I bring us both back to reality, or at least I try to as Cara throws herself around to stop me dead in my tracks - my feet almost tripping to an abrupt stop. 



""They need hundreds of females for this project - it's running all across the country Margot! I also don't imagine that many will be jumping at the chance of staying with a dangerous criminal either do you? So quit your negative attitude and start believing that our lives could change any day now for the better!"" Cara deadpans, pointing an accusing finger at my chest in warning. 



Breathing out heavily, followed by a dramatic eye roll, I eventually gave in to her and nodded. ""Fine, ok! I'll have a little faith! But we won't know until next week if they've even gotten back to us - not unless you want to travel hours to the next town to see if they have a library offering free WiFi there?!"" I chuckle, watching the smile stretch back on to Cara's face. 



""Tell me about it! That woman back there is seriously a fucking bitch! And for what? She must know herself that us young ones clearly have nothing better to do with our time around here, so why not just let us stay on there a little longer? It's not like the place is busy with people needing to use the fucking computers."" Cara grumbles, as we pick up our steps again. 



The late afternoon sun burned low in the sky as we ranted on, casting everything around us in a harsh, golden glow. 



Our sneakers crunched over the gravel dirt roads as we walked, the heat pressing against our backs like an invisible weight. 



The town felt empty, as it always did — just long stretches of cracked pavement, dust-covered pickup trucks, and faded signs hanging over rundown stores.



We passed the gas station on the corner, where an old man in a stained undershirt rocked back and forth in a plastic chair outside, chewing on a toothpick. He squinted at us as we walked by, but neither of us paid him any attention. People around here always had something to look at, something to say, but never anything worth listening to...



The trailer park was still around a fifteen-minute walk away, and with each step, the weight of what we'd just done settled itself deeper in my stomach.



""What if this isn't what we think it is?"" I asked, kicking a loose stone across the road.



Cara scoffed, giving me a playful shove. ""You always overthink shit. You saw the ad for yourself — it's simple. A few weeks in there, maybe months, getting cozy with some guy who's probably more bark than bite, and then we're free to go with fifty grand in our pockets.""



I frowned, but she wasn't wrong about one thing — nobody in this town got a chance like this. We were stuck in a place that had nothing to offer, scraping by with whatever side jobs we could find, living off gas station snacks and borrowed WiFi. 



It was shit. 



This money could actually change something, despite what we have to do to get it... 



But still, I couldn't shake the feeling that we had just signed ourselves up for something far bigger than what we even understood.



""You're not even a little nervous about getting picked out though?"" I continued on, adjusting the strap of my worn-out bag over my shoulder. ""I mean, these are real life prisoners, Cara. As in, murderers. Gang members. People who don't belong on the outside for a reason... they might take one look at us and just end it all - no fifty grand for us, only death!""



Cara snorted. ""Or maybe they're just misjudged guys who made mistakes. You know how screwed up the justice system is. Some of them are probably harmless. And besides, we're not moving in with them forever. We would only be there to offer a shoulder to cry on, to help them adjust to life on the outside, right?"" She grinned, nudging me again. ""Maybe you'll even find yourself a hot reformed bad boy lover in the process.""



I shot her a glare. ""That is absolutely not funny.""



She only laughed, tossing her sweaty blonde hair back over her shoulder.



The truth was, I didn't know what to expect. The ad hadn't gone into much detail beyond the money, the 'groundbreaking rehabilitation program,' and the confidentiality agreement we'd basically agreed to blindly. 



But if it was legitimate — and if we were chosen — then in a few weeks, everything could very well be different.



Maybe even better? 



But as we crossed the road and stepped onto the dirt path leading into the trailer park, I couldn't ignore the creeping thought resting in the back of my mind.



We had no idea what we had just gotten ourselves into.



But I also believed that it couldn't get much worse than where we were already trapped - in this hell hole of a place...



# Chapter 2 - The Reason



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Margot's POV\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



The sun hung low in the sky, bleeding deep shades of orange and red across the horizon as Cara and I trudged through the last stretch of the dirt road leading into the trailer park. 



The air had thickened with the coming night, heavy with the scent of dry grass and cigarette smoke drifting from a few trailers down.



We stopped where the road forked — Cara's place to the left, mine to the right.



""Well,"" she said, exhaling as she turned to me. ""Another thrilling day back here in paradise.""



I forced a weak smile, shifting my weight between my feet. We always lingered here longer than necessary, neither of us wanting to part ways. Especially me.



Cara's home life wasn't ideal either, but at least her Mom tried on a good day when she wasn't shooting up... or should I say, couldn't afford to shoot up? 



Cara hated seeing her Mom high, but had grown used to the sight over the years. But despite the fact, she had often reminded me that she wasn't all bad, since despite her Mom wasting away - she would never hit or yell at her... 



At times I was jealous, considering that we both had it bad, but hers seemed that little bit more bearable compared to my own situation. 



At least Cara had someone who deep down, actually cared for her behind the shell of her addiction, unlike someone who would greet her at the door with whiskey-soaked breath and a clenched fist most days out of the week...



""Try not to overthink things tonight,"" Cara nudged me lightly, her voice softer now, like she knew exactly where my head was going. ""We did the right thing, Margot. We won't be stuck here forever - at least we are trying to get out, right?""



I nodded, but my stomach twisted itself up into knots. 



I wasn't even thinking about the experiment right now. I was thinking about the rusted trailer that was waiting for me, the man inside it, and whether he'd be passed out or looking for something to hit.



""Yeah,"" I muttered. ""I'll see you tomorrow?""



Cara gave me a knowing look. ""You will, unless I wake up rich and famous overnight and I'm outta here by sunrise.""



I forced a laugh, watching as she turned on her heel and disappeared toward her trailer, her silhouette swallowed by the dimming light. ""You know I'd never leave you behind though right? You're my girl!"" She called back over her shoulder, as I watched her disappear further and further down the road. 



The moment she was gone, the weight of reality settled down on my shoulders like an asteroid sent to crush the earth.



I inhaled deeply, forcing my feet to move despite my brain screaming not to.



The path crunched beneath my worn in sneakers, the sound too loud in the eerie quiet of the trailer park as I feared waking everyone up in the desolate space. 



Most people had already retreated inside for the night, the glow of muted televisions flickering behind thin curtains from those who had them. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked. A baby cried. A man yelled. 



It was all too familiar, too 'normal' that I hated it even more... 



Then I eventually saw it — our trailer.



It slumped against the fading sky like a forgotten relic, the paint peeling, the metal rusting. A crushed beer can lay near the front steps, the first sign that my father was already home. 



The second sign was the faint glow of the television leaking through the window, illuminating the living room in a sickly, blue hue.



I hesitated at the door on my approach, listening in for a moment.



Silence.



Not good.



Silence meant he was either passed out or waiting...



Bracing myself, I slowly pushed the door open, the hinges groaning in protest and revealing my position.



The stench hit me first — sour alcohol, stale sweat, and something burnt. 



I stepped inside, careful to keep my footsteps light. 



The living room was a mess, but that was nothing new. Empty bottles cluttered around on the floor, an overflowing ashtray sat on the coffee table, and the TV buzzed on a static-filled channel.



Then I saw him.



My father sat slumped in his recliner, his beer-stained tank top stretched over his gut, one hand gripping a half-empty bottle, the other hanging loosely over the armrest. His eyes were closed, mouth slightly open.



Asleep.



Relief flooded me so fast that my knees almost buckled.



I moved quickly, heading toward my room at the far end of the trailer, careful to avoid the creaky floorboards on my way. 



If I could just make it inside, lock the door, maybe tonight wouldn't end in more bruises to add to my growing collection... 



But as I reached for the handle, his voice cut through the air, thick and slurred.



""Where the hell you been, girl?""



My stomach clenched and heaved at the tone.



I turned slowly, my fingers still curled around the doorknob. He was blinking up at me now, his face contorted in a drunken haze.



""Library with Cara,"" I said carefully.



He scoffed at me, spit flying out, before dragging a hand down his face before taking another swig from the bottle. ""Library,"" he mimicked in a squeaky voice, shaking his head. ""Like that's gonna do you any good in this damn town - reading shit fucking stories.""



I said nothing. That was always the safest option.



He shifted in his chair, narrowing his bloodshot eyes at me. ""You sneakin' around in here now, girl? You think I don't notice when you come home late? When you creep by me without sayin' a word?""



My pulse pounded in my ears. I knew this game. He was looking for something to fight about, some excuse to remind me who was in charge. Even when I stood here in total silence... 



I forced my voice to stay even. ""I told you. I was just out at the library.""



He let out a bitter laugh. ""Yeah? And what exactly are you learnin' there? How to be a goddamn disappointment?""



My jaw locked, my fingers gripping the doorknob tighter. I bit my tongue, swallowing back the words I wanted to spit back at him, knowing they would only make things far worse.



He watched me for a moment longer, as if daring me to push back. Then, just as quickly as the anger flared, it died out. He grunted and waved a dismissive hand.



""Get the hell outta my sight, I don't have the energy to teach you another lesson tonight!"" he sneered, turning back to the TV and hitting the remote around until something watchable showed up.



I didn't wait for him to change his mind.



I slipped into my room, shutting the door behind me as quietly as I could before locking it. My hands shook as I pressed my forehead against the wood, exhaling a breath I hadn't realised I'd been holding in.



Safe.



At least for now.



For another night. 



I turned and took in the familiar sight of my tiny room— the bare walls, a lumpy mattress on the floor, a small desk covered in old notebooks and pens that barely worked. 



The one place in this entire world that was mine.



Collapsing down onto my bed, I stared at the cracked ceiling, my mind flooding.



This place was a reminder that the whole prison idea wasn't all that bad... it would be an upgrade to this tramp den! 



One week.



That's all I needed to wait to find out if the applications had gotten us anywhere.



One more week, and maybe — just maybe — I'd finally have a way out of this trap. 



Whatever the cost, so be it, if it means I can get away from him!



# Chapter 3 - Dread



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Margot's POV\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



The swing creaked beneath me, its rusted chains groaning with every slow back-and-forth motion. 



It was a familiar sound, one that had underscored a hundred conversations between Cara and me over the years, but today, it felt louder — grating, intrusive. 



Or maybe that was just from the way my head ached.



Five days had passed since we sent off our applications. Five long days of waiting, of hoping, of forcing myself to believe that escape was more than just some stupid pipe dream. 



How ironic? Begging for an escape from our home town to a prison cell... 



If I stopped to think about it, it was the dumbest sounding thing in the world, but anything was better than here and so as each day ticked by, I found myself hoping to hear back from them to say that we had been selected! 



But five days of waiting also meant another five more nights being trapped at home. Five more nights of trying to be invisible. Five more nights of not moving fast enough... 



I could still feel last night's lesson pulsing beneath my eye, the skin swollen and stretched tight. The bruise had fully bloomed by morning, an ugly mix of purple and yellow. 



I hadn't even bothered to check how bad it looked in a mirror as the rest of the day proceeded forward. The sting alone was enough of a reminder that it was still very much there.



Cara sat beside me on the neighboring swing, kicking at the dirt with the toe of her scuffed up boot. She hadn't looked directly at me for a while now, her eyes flicking up only in short, sharp glances before snapping away again.



She was working up to it.



The question.



The first one was always casual, as if she were just making conversation.



""So... how bad was it this time?"" The words fell out past her teeth. 



I exhaled, my fingers tightening around the chains. ""It was fine. Not the worst, I guess."" I shrug. 



She let out a breath through her nose, her boot scraping harder against the ground. ""Margot...""



I shot her a look, one that was meant to shut her down, but she didn't take the hint. She never did. Her concern always topped all else. 



""Did it last long?"" she pressed, softer this time.



I shrugged. ""What does it matter? It's done now anyhow.""



Her mouth pressed out into a thin line. ""You could always crash at mine tonight,"" she offered, but we both knew it wasn't a real solution after what happened last time I had done that... 



Her place was barely better too. And besides, if I didn't go home, he'd only be angrier the next time that I did.



""Thanks, but I'll be fine."" I nod once to clarify my own lie. 



The lies came so easy now, it barely even tasted like one anymore.



Cara huffed, leaning back against the swing chains, her arms looping around them loosely. ""You ever get tired of pretending that it doesn't bother you? That living with him doesn't bother you?""



""Do you?"" I shot back, raising an eyebrow, my patience wearing thin today.



She sighed, shaking her head. ""Touché.""



Silence stretched between us for a while, thick and suffocating, as the guilt of snapping at my friend slowly settled itself in to my gut... 



But before I could address it with a makeshift apology, I noticed something had caught Cara's attention. She perked up suddenly, her body going rigid as she sat up straighter to get a better view from across the street... 



""What?"" I asked, not bothering to follow her gaze.



She nodded toward the library. ""Margot, Look.""



I turned just in time to see the grumpy librarian, as she stepped out onto the sidewalk, adjusting her bag over her shoulder before hurrying off down the street meanwhile checking her wristwatch.



""Where's she going?"" I question out loud, knowing that Cara only knew just as much as I did. 



Cara grinned. ""Hopefully far enough away to not notice if we help ourselves to the WiFi for a quick five minutes."" 



I sat up a little, watching as she fully disappeared around the corner... 



The library was still open — the sign on the door made that extremely clear. But without her at the front desk... whoever was left in her place, wouldn't know that we had already been in earlier this week! 



I glanced back at Cara.

I’m coming from a Nespresso VertuoLine, an OXO grinder (soon to upgrade), and mostly make cold brew, pour overs, and French press at home.

I’ve been researching a ton over the last month, and my budget is $1800–$2000 for a machine (grinder separate). I’ll usually make one milk-based drink daily and maybe a couple back-to-back on weekends when family’s over. I work remotely, so no rush during the day — but I’d like something that handles milk drinks well. I’m leaning toward dual boiler or machines with a separate thermoblock for steaming, since I know single boilers can be limiting but not opposed to it if I can dial in a workflow. 

My wife, on the other hand, is a teacher who leaves early and loves big cups of coffee she can sip from her Yeti mug all morning. She likes quality but also quantity, and she’s skeptical this setup won’t replace her French press or pour over for weekdays so how does it help (not the point of the setup but I digress)

I’ve seen machines like the Maxim La Siene X, which can tweak flow and pressure for a “drip-style” or pour-over profile, and I’m curious if there are others that could pull double duty. I’d prefer to avoid all-in-one machines with built-in grinders.

Shortlist:
	•	Maxim La Siene X
	•	Diletta Mio
	•	Silvia Pro X
	•	Ascaso Steel Duo
	•	Profitec Go (or wait for the Go Dual Boiler)
	•	MiiCoffee Apex V2 / Turin Legato V2 (wild card)

Reason behind every choice

Avvatar – My most preferred one because of its quality and taste. I absolutely love the Cafe Mocha Swirl flavor, it tastes just like coffee with milk. The whey quality is top notch, and I genuinely trust this brand. (Basically, I use it on a regular basis.)

MuscleBlaze – Good enough in terms of both quality and flavor (Blue Tokai). Got it for around ₹2k per kg, so overall a pretty decent deal.

Yogabar Whey – The fact that it’s naturally sweetened and was available at a steal deal made it an easy choice. Normally, the monk fruit sweetened version sells for much higher.

Yogabar Protein Shake (Cold Coffee) – Travel-friendly and super convenient, but the main highlight is the taste, it’s honestly too good. The price was also quite reasonable.

Then I realized something that changed my perspective. It was that **my life wasn't boring because nothing was happening it was boring because I was avoiding everything that made me uncomfortable.**

Here's what's actually making your life feel empty:

Watching other people live instead of living yourself. YouTube vlogs, Instagram stories, TikTok trends you're consuming everyone else's experiences instead of creating your own. Your brain knows the difference between watching and doing. Vicarious living gives you none of the satisfaction of actual experiences.

You've optimized all the friction out of your life

Same coffee, same commute, same lunch spot, same weekend routine. You've eliminated all uncertainty and novelty. Your brain stops encoding memories when nothing changes. That's why time feels like it's flying by you're not creating distinct experiences to remember.

You're waiting for permission to do what you want

""I'll travel when I have more money."" ""I'll start that hobby when I have more time."" ""I'll make friends when I'm in a better place."" You're postponing your life until conditions are perfect. They never will be.

You say no to everything that involves effort

Turning down invitations, avoiding plans that require driving somewhere, choosing Netflix over going out. Comfort is the opposite of interesting. Every time you choose easy over uncertain, you're choosing boring over memorable.

You're not learning anything new

Consuming the same type of content, talking to the same people, thinking the same thoughts on repeat. Growth feels like aliveness. Stagnation feels like death. When you stop learning, you stop living. The act of being bad at something new makes you feel alive.

You're addicted to low-effort dopamine

Scrolling, snacking, binging shows activities that require zero effort and give instant gratification. High-dopamine activities make everything else feel dull by comparison. Real life can't compete with algorithmically optimized content.

When you lower your baseline stimulation, regular life becomes interesting again.

You have no goals worth getting excited about

By far the most important lesson is this. Going through motions without working toward anything specific. No projects, no challenges, no ""I can't wait until..."" Anticipation is what makes life feel full. When you have nothing to look forward to, every day feels the same.

You're avoiding discomfort at all costs

Choosing familiar over unknown, safe over risky, comfortable over challenging. Stories are born from discomfort. ""Everything went according to plan"" has never been an interesting story.

My life didn't become perfect when I learned all of this stuff but at least it became something I'm proud of.

Hello, Fiddle Tit Guts

Firstly, thank you for the laugh I almost choked on my coffee watching your post. You strut around like some rich, worldly influencer-slash-lawyer who “doesn’t care about the cost,” yet somehow didn’t manage to fly business class? Darling, please. That’s not rich energy, that’s Jetstar-on-a-budget energy.

Then you hop online complaining about having to pay extra for food, drinks, and entertainment. For someone who supposedly “knows everything,” you might want to brush up on how airplanes work. Ever heard of Google? You can literally check what’s included before you fly. Maybe your travel agent-slash-fanboy should’ve mentioned that oh wait, he was too busy pretending you were Madonna.

And of course, we knew you would come online and say: “We didn’t want to travel much, we just wanted to relax.” Translation: Too lazy to spend time with the kids and explore..so Predictable. You’re so scripted we could write your next TikTok for you and of course we called it, you’re as predictable as the lemons on your T-shirt.

Then there’s the kids club fiasco. Who sends their kids to a resort club on a 30° day without swimmers? Did you think the staff were going to fan them dry with Fijian palm leaves? You’re not just out of touch, you’re out of brain cells. Imagine going to Fiji just to dump your kids and film yourself walking around pretending to be relatable.

Meanwhile, she’s posting TikToks with more contradictions than a politician one day she’s doing water aerobics, the next day she “didn’t do any activities.” Sweetheart, if lying were a sport, you’d finally have your gold medal moment.

You carry on like the rest of us are idiots hanging on your every review, as if your opinion on hotel breakfasts could change lives. Hate to break it to you darling You’re not an influencer you’re a D-influencer. You de-influence people from ever wanting to do what you do.

I love her dearly and she is a good person. She has ADHD which she says causes her ""time blindness"" which I believe, for the record. She also suffers from occasional bouts of depression. I don't doubt this. But she will go weeks, if not months, before replying to a text. ie. She always responds, but it's just usually weeks or months later. This makes it extremely difficult to set up time to hang out, and I try to offer very low key activities like getting coffee or going for a walk. When we are able to make plans (which is very rare), she cancels last minute about 50% of the time. In case it's relevant, she's a single person without dependents, and I say that to include the context that it's her mental health struggles and the ordinary struggles of work and adulting that she's navigating and not a spouse and children on top of that. 

When asked, she has told me she really does value my friendship and apologises profusely, but nothing changes. I've done my best to be understanding and accommodating for a long time now because I really am empathetic to her struggles, but it also hurts my feelings to see my texts going unanswered for long periods or plans being cancelled and not seeing her when she literally lives 3 miles down the road. For context, even though we live so near each other, I've seen her 3 times in the last year, but I think the huge gaps in communication are almost more of an issue.

I feel like I'm reaching the end of my patience/tolerance, and it's not a nice feeling to have. So I just wonder - do I let go of the friendship entirely and not say anything? Do I let go of it and tell her why? Do I try to be more tolerant given her mental health struggles? Somehow this doesn't feel healthy to me. I know it might seem like a small thing because there's so little there anyway, but I find it challenging to continue to hold space in my heart for someone putting in so little effort or to know how to respond when I do (eventually) hear from her again.

For those wanting to suggest I talk to her, she is already well aware of these issues.

The idea came while traveling, since I wanted to know where other nomads were working from and connect with them. Google Maps shows cafés and coworking spaces, but it doesn’t tell you which ones are actually good for working — or if there are other nomads nearby. Also, I wanted an easy way to see all the locations I've worked from on my projects in a scratch map style - something like GitHub activity calendar but geo-based.

Main things I wanted to focus on:

✅ Discover popular places to work from

✅ Drop pins, customize them with icons, set visibility and organize them into different projects

✅ Promote your projects in a new way (for people building in cafés after their 9-5)

✅ Track countries you've worked from

✅ Connect with fellow nomads

  
My tech stack includes Flutter, Spring WebFlux, PostgreSQL, Auth0 & deployed with Docker on Hetzner VPS. I built the app in about 4 weeks in September and submitted it for RevenuCat's Shipaton hackathon. The idea was to build in public and compete in that category, but I only started posting after releasing the app. I've been relatively active on X, with little success. I also posted on couple of sites including HackerNews, ProductHunt, Reddit, PeerList, Aura++, ..

You’re not alone.**

Both devices brew coffee, but they do it in very different ways, creating distinct flavors and experiences. Understanding these differences can help you pick the perfect machine that matches your taste and lifestyle. You’ll discover how espresso machines and coffee makers work, the unique qualities of each, and which one suits your coffee cravings best.

Keep reading to make an informed choice and enjoy every cup just the way you like it.

# Espresso Machine Basics

An espresso machine brews coffee by forcing hot water through tightly packed coffee grounds. This process uses high pressure to create a strong, rich flavor. Unlike regular coffee makers, espresso machines deliver a small, concentrated shot.

Understanding how an [espresso machine](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machine-for-beginners/) works helps to see why it differs from a coffee maker. The machine’s design focuses on speed and intensity, producing a bold coffee experience.

# Pressure Brewing Method

Espresso machines use about 9 bars of pressure to brew coffee. This high pressure forces water through the coffee grounds quickly. The pressure extracts oils and flavors that regular coffee makers cannot.

This method creates a thick, creamy layer called crema on top of the espresso shot. Crema adds texture and aroma to the coffee.

# Fine Coffee Grind

The coffee grind for espresso is much finer than for drip coffee makers. Fine grounds allow water to pass through slowly under pressure. This slow extraction enhances the coffee’s strength and flavor.

Coarse grounds, used in coffee makers, let water drip through quickly, resulting in a milder brew. Espresso machines require precise grinding to work properly.

# Espresso Shot Characteristics

An espresso shot is small, usually one ounce or less. It has a dense, concentrated flavor. The shot is thick and full-bodied compared to regular coffee.

Espresso serves as the base for drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos. Its intensity makes it popular among coffee lovers seeking a bold taste.

# Coffee Maker Basics

Coffee makers brew coffee using a simple and natural process. They rely on gravity to move hot water through the coffee grounds. This method creates a smooth and mild cup of coffee. Coffee makers are common in many homes due to their ease of use and ability to make multiple cups at once.

The process is slower compared to espresso machines. It allows the water to absorb flavors gently. This results in a balanced and less intense taste. Understanding these basics helps to see how coffee makers differ from espresso machines.

# Gravity Drip Method

The gravity drip method uses hot water poured over coffee grounds. Gravity pulls the water down through a filter. This extracts flavor and oils from the coffee slowly. The brewed coffee then drips into a pot below. This method is simple and needs no high pressure.

# Coarse Coffee Grounds

Coffee makers use coarser coffee grounds than espresso machines. Coarse grounds allow water to flow easily. They prevent over-extraction and bitterness. The size of the grounds affects the flavor and brewing time. Using the right grind is important for the best taste.

# Drip Coffee Flavor Profile

Drip coffee has a lighter and milder flavor. It is less concentrated than espresso. The slow brewing brings out subtle notes in the coffee. This makes drip coffee smooth and easy to drink. It suits those who enjoy a gentle and classic coffee taste.

# Key Differences

Understanding the key differences between an espresso machine and a coffee maker helps you choose the right device. Both machines brew coffee but use distinct processes. These differences affect flavor, texture, and brewing time. Below are the main factors that set them apart.

# Brewing Mechanism

An espresso machine forces hot water through tightly packed coffee grounds using high pressure. This process extracts coffee quickly, usually within 25-30 seconds. A coffee maker uses gravity to drip hot water slowly through coarser coffee grounds. This method takes longer and produces a lighter brew.

# Coffee Concentration Levels

Espresso machines create a highly concentrated coffee shot. The result is a strong, bold flavor with a thick body. Coffee makers produce a larger cup with a mild taste. The coffee is less intense and smoother, perfect for casual drinking.

# Crema Formation

Espresso machines generate crema, a creamy, golden layer on top of the espresso shot. Crema adds richness and aroma. Coffee makers do not produce crema because they lack the pressure needed to create it. This is a key visual and taste difference.

# Grind Size Requirements

Espresso requires a fine grind to allow fast extraction under pressure. The grounds need to be compacted tightly for a proper shot. Coffee makers work best with medium to coarse grinds. This prevents over-extraction and clogging during the drip process.

# Types Of Coffee Produced

Different coffee machines produce different types of coffee. The method each machine uses affects the flavor, strength, and texture of the final drink. Understanding the types of coffee produced helps you choose the right machine for your taste.

# Espresso-based Drinks

Espresso machines make strong, concentrated coffee called espresso. They force hot water through finely ground coffee using high pressure. This process creates a thick, rich shot with a layer of crema on top.

Espresso is the base for many popular drinks. These include lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and Americanos. Each drink mixes espresso with steamed milk, foam, or hot water in different amounts.

The intense flavor and creamy texture of espresso-based drinks make them unique. They are perfect for those who enjoy bold coffee with a smooth finish.

# Regular Drip Coffee

Coffee makers produce regular drip coffee. Hot water slowly drips over coarser coffee grounds. Gravity helps the water extract the flavor from the coffee as it passes through a filter.

This method creates a larger cup of milder coffee. It is less concentrated than espresso and has a lighter taste. Drip coffee is ideal for drinking throughout the day or serving multiple people.

Regular drip coffee machines are easy to use. They suit those who prefer a simple, classic coffee experience without strong intensity.

# Usage And Purpose

The usage and purpose of espresso machines and coffee makers differ significantly. Each device serves unique needs and preferences. Understanding these differences helps choose the right machine for your coffee habits. Below, we explore their volume, flavor, and specialty drink capabilities.

# Volume And Serving Size

Coffee makers brew larger amounts of coffee at once. They suit those who want multiple cups quickly. An average drip coffee maker serves 4 to 12 cups per brew. Espresso machines produce small, concentrated shots. Each shot is about 1 to 2 ounces. These machines focus on single or double servings at a time.

# Flavor Intensity

Espresso machines extract coffee under high pressure. This process creates a bold, intense flavor. The coffee is thicker with a rich crema layer. Coffee makers use gravity to drip water through grounds. They produce milder and smoother coffee. The flavor is lighter and less concentrated than espresso.

# Specialty Drink Preparation

Espresso machines are ideal for specialty drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. They often include steam wands to froth milk. This feature allows for creamy, textured drinks. Coffee makers typically do not have milk frothing options. They focus on straightforward drip coffee. Espresso machines offer more variety for coffee enthusiasts.

# Choosing Between Machines

Choosing between an espresso machine and a coffee maker depends on several factors. Each machine suits different needs and preferences. Understanding these can help you pick the right one for your daily coffee ritual.

# Lifestyle And Preferences

Espresso machines appeal to those who enjoy rich, strong coffee. They are perfect for making espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. Coffee makers work well for people who prefer milder, larger cups of coffee. They suit those who drink several cups throughout the day. Your coffee taste and drinking habits matter most.

# Budget And Maintenance

Coffee makers usually cost less upfront and have simpler maintenance. They require less cleaning and fewer parts to replace. Espresso machines often have a higher price due to complex parts. They need regular cleaning and occasional repairs. Consider your budget and the time you can spend on upkeep.

# Space And Convenience

Coffee makers tend to be compact and easy to use. They fit well in small kitchens and offices. Espresso machines can be larger and more complex. They need more counter space and time to operate. Think about your kitchen size and how much effort you want to invest each morning.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is An Espresso Machine The Same As A Coffee Maker?

No, an espresso machine differs from a coffee maker. It uses high pressure for a concentrated shot, while coffee makers use gravity for milder drip coffee.

# Can I Use My Coffee Maker To Make Espresso?

No, a regular coffee maker cannot make true espresso. Espresso requires high pressure, which coffee makers lack. Use an espresso machine for rich, concentrated shots.

# Can I Use An Espresso Machine To Make Regular Coffee?

You can use an espresso machine to make coffee, but it produces a stronger, concentrated shot, not regular drip coffee. Regular coffee requires coarser grounds and slower brewing, which espresso machines do not provide. Use an espresso machine for espresso-based drinks, not traditional drip-style coffee.

# Which Is Healthier, Espresso Or Brewed Coffee?

Espresso contains more caffeine per ounce but less per serving than brewed coffee. Brewed coffee offers more antioxidants and is lower in calories. Both provide health benefits; choose based on your caffeine needs and taste preference.

# Conclusion

Choosing between an espresso machine and a [coffee maker](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-makers-for-beginners/) depends on your taste. Coffee makers brew a mild, larger cup with simple drip methods. Espresso machines create strong, concentrated shots using high pressure. Each machine suits different preferences and uses.

Knowing these differences helps you pick the best option. Whether you want quick, rich espresso or smooth drip coffee, the right machine makes all the difference. Enjoy your coffee your way.",1,1760005972.0,u_johnsmithmath89,0,1.0,False

Firstly, thank you for the laugh I almost choked on my coffee watching your post. You strut around like some rich, worldly influencer-slash-lawyer who “doesn’t care about the cost,” yet somehow didn’t manage to fly business class? Darling, please. That’s not rich energy, that’s Jetstar-on-a-budget energy.

Then you hop online complaining about having to pay extra for food, drinks, and entertainment. For someone who supposedly “knows everything,” you might want to brush up on how airplanes work. Ever heard of Google? You can literally check what’s included before you fly. Maybe your travel agent-slash-fanboy should’ve mentioned that oh wait, he was too busy pretending you were Madonna.

And of course, we knew you would come online and say: “We didn’t want to travel much, we just wanted to relax.” Translation: Too lazy to spend time with the kids and explore..so Predictable. You’re so scripted we could write your next TikTok for you and of course we called it, you’re as predictable as the lemons on your T-shirt.

Then there’s the kids club fiasco. Who sends their kids to a resort club on a 30° day without swimmers? Did you think the staff were going to fan them dry with Fijian palm leaves? You’re not just out of touch, you’re out of brain cells. Imagine going to Fiji just to dump your kids and film yourself walking around pretending to be relatable.

Meanwhile, she’s posting TikToks with more contradictions than a politician one day she’s doing water aerobics, the next day she “didn’t do any activities.” Sweetheart, if lying were a sport, you’d finally have your gold medal moment.

You carry on like the rest of us are idiots hanging on your every review, as if your opinion on hotel breakfasts could change lives. Hate to break it to you darling You’re not an influencer you’re a D-influencer. You de-influence people from ever wanting to do what you do.

1o22cqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bondha_diaries/comments/1o22cqo/burnout_but_make_it_aesthetic/,"Burnout, but make it aesthetic","This morning, I came across an Instagram reel of a guy staying at a five-star hotel. He was sipping coffee and filming himself staring out the window like he was contemplating life. The caption says that he is on a “2-day staycation”. And I’m sitting there like, what the hell is a **staycation**?

So, like every average internet user post 2020, I asked ChatGPT. Turns out, it’s literally just a holiday where you don’t actually go anywhere. You stay at home (or close to it) but take time off work, relax, and do leisure activities. *Basic ga manam school lo unnappudu sundays laaga anamaata. Ala chusthe naa college life motham staycation eh!* When I looked into it a little more on Google, I learned that the term ""staycation"" became widely used around 2007–2009, during the recession, when people couldn’t afford big trips. Today, it’s mostly used by corporate professionals in corporate wellness emails and self-care posts, as a way to make “not going anywhere” sound intentional and empowering.

People are so fried by doing jobs they hate that lying on the couch for two days now has a word. They call it a *staycation*. We work ourselves half to death, then glamorize our recovery time for the sake of showing society that we are living life. We’re here branding burnout while AI is out there mastering our jobs without ever needing a coffee, a weekend, or a nervous breakdown. If it is already better at our jobs, the least we can do is take life a little easier and spend time doing what actually makes us feel human.",3,1760005819.0,bondha_diaries,0,1.0,False

1o22aqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1o22aqx/my_experience_with_keto_is_always_so_interesting/,My experience with keto is always so interesting and unexpected :D,"For background, I cycle on and off keto. I do keto in Sept-Oct, and then again in Jan-Feb. The rest of the year I just aim for low-carb. However, in that longer period from March to August, I tend to lose track a bit and gain a bit of weight ;) So the Sept-Oct keto is more targeted toward knocking off those kilos I gained over the summer :D Jan-Feb is more just maintenance.

Anyway! It's really interesting because I mostly follow the same plan every time, and my experience is always different! This time, I did not lose any water weight at the start, and I'm now 6 weeks in to my 8 weeks of keto, and I basically didn't lose anything - I was feeling a little bit deflated, but was also just glad I wasn't gaining haha! - until now, suddenly I'm down 2 kilos! :D It felt like it just suddenly happened! 

Other times, I've dropped kilos quite drastically, while other times even I haven't dropped \*any\* kilos! I just find it so interesting and I do wonder why it's like this! 

But the main reason I do keto cycles is the same reason I quit coffee for the entire month of March every year - it's a ""reset"" on an addiction. Carbs are addictive, and caffeine is addictive. By ""quitting"" them every so often, my addiction resets. If I don't quit coffee once a year, I eventually end up drinking 3 or 4 cups a day, but by resetting every year, after March I only have one a day, and by the following March, I'm having two before resetting. And same with carbs. After a keto cycle, I don't crave carbs so much and it's easy to keep them under control. But after some months, the addiction starts to creep back and I start to consume more than I want/should. So the keto reset keeps that in check. :) 

I am really glad I discovered keto 3 years ago - really has changed how I approach food and eating :) And it's always a different experience, keeping me on my toes! :D  ",2,1760005620.0,keto,0,0.75,False

# Beijing requires export licenses for goods made with certain rare-earth materials and tech from China, even when manufactured abroad

[China’s export controls cover technologies used in rare-earth mining, smelting, and other processing steps.© nayan sthankiya\/Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/0b3503qc32uf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3c116caa375d3b7549aee6c045d43a4a1e659aa)

SINGAPORE—China tightened its control over critical minerals used to make high-tech products including electric vehicles and jet fighters, threatening to reignite trade tensions with the U.S. ahead of an expected meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

China’s Commerce Ministry said Thursday that foreign suppliers must obtain approval from Beijing to export some products with certain rare-earth materials originating from China if they account for 0.1% or more of the good’s total value. Goods produced with certain technologies from China are also subject to the export controls. Both restrictions apply to products manufactured outside of China.

Export applications for products with military uses generally won’t be approved, the ministry said, adding that licenses related to semiconductors or artificial-intelligence development will be granted on a case-by-case basis.

The controls expand on Beijing’s moves earlier this year to require licenses for exports of certain rare-earth metals and related products. Automotive, electronics and defense companies in the U.S. and around the world have [struggled to get supplies](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/car-companies-production-rare-earth-shortage-aaf87ad2), elevating China’s grip on rare earths to a central place in trade negotiations with Washington.

China has spent decades building up its dominance in global rare-earth mining and processing, giving Beijing significant leverage that it has [flexed this year.](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-flexes-chokehold-on-rare-earth-magnets-as-exports-plunge-in-may-c1adac50) It produces around 90% of the world’s rare earths and controls much of the supply of many other critical minerals. Suppliers for the U.S. military are [dependent on Chinese materials](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51) used to make items such as drones and missile-targeting systems.

The new rules signal that China is extending its control further down the rare-earth supply chain as the U.S. and other Western countries aim to [build up domestic industries ](https://www.wsj.com/business/us-rare-earth-producer-texas-58796240)and reduce reliance on China.

“They want to maintain as much of that strategic position as possible,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. He added that the new controls could be a headache for a lot of manufacturers, given that rare earths are used in many products.

Beijing’s latest move comes as Trump and Xi are planning to meet at a regional gathering of leaders in South Korea at the end of the month, with Trump signaling follow-up visits to Beijing by him in early 2026 and to the U.S. by Xi later next year. A recent deal brokered between the two countries for the sale of a controlling stake in Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok to American investors has paved the way for the series of high-level talks.

Earlier this year, U.S.-China trade negotiations came to a head after Beijing’s rare-earth controls created supply shortages for American companies.

***“There’s the risk that it could derail things a bit,” Evans-Pritchard said. “China is reopening the same can of worms.”***

In explaining its new rules, China’s commerce ministry said Thursday that some foreign organizations and individuals had transferred or supplied rare-earth materials of Chinese origin to entities involved in military and other sensitive fields, posing serious harm and potential threats to China’s national security.

The latest export controls cover technologies used in rare-earth mining, smelting and other processing steps, the ministry said. Some of the controls take effect immediately, while the rest will be in place starting Dec. 1.

It wasn’t immediately clear from the guidelines how China intends to enforce the new rules.

The ministry said Chinese suppliers will be required to issue a compliance notice to overseas buyers for items considered dual-use, meaning products that have both civilian and military applications. Foreign exporters using those Chinese components are also required to issue a compliance notice to the next recipient.

Exports for humanitarian purposes—emergency medical care, responses to public health emergencies, or natural disaster relief—are exempt from the dual‑use export license requirement for overseas exporters, the ministry said. But the exports should be reported to the ministry within 10 days via email.

Entities identified on China’s export control list, including subsidiaries or firms of which they hold majority ownership, will generally not be approved for exporting dual-use items and technology, the ministry said.

In a separate action on Thursday, China’s Commerce Ministry added 14 organizations to its “unreliable entity list,” which bans them from engaging in trade and investment in China. Those include 12 U.S.-based companies or subsidiaries, nonprofit summit organizer Halifax International Security Forum and Canada-headquartered semiconductor technology research firm TechInsights.

**The U.S. also has a trade blacklist known as an entity list for companies it says pose national security risks. The Trump administration recently** [**expanded its controls**](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-targets-chinas-tech-sector-by-expanding-trade-blacklist-9873ad34) **to subsidiaries of entity list companies, targeting China’s tech sector.**

* **China has a monopoly on heavy rare earth elements: “For heavy rare earths, the United States is fully reliant on China. For some of the other ones, the lighter rare earths, it’s a little bit different, since the United States is also a producer.” (7:50)**
* **An unprecedented deal to secure resource independence: “The government made a deal that we haven’t seen before. It includes an equity investment, an offtake agreement for the rare earths, and an offtake agreement for the final magnet. So, it’s really a deal that focuses on trying to create a homegrown United States mine-to-magnet supply chain.” (12:43)**
* **The US government takes the financial risk: “We need to accept that we’re going to invest and not make back all of that money. Some of that is going to be lost forever, but you have to be willing to do that to actually get to the deposits that allow you to diversify your supply chains.” (24:00)**

# Oct. 9th, 2025~Ambler Road Approved to Secure U.S. Critical Minerals Dominance

[Ambler Road Approved to Secure U.S. Critical Minerals Dominance | Independent Women's Forum](https://www.independentwomen.com/2025/10/09/ambler-road-approved-to-secure-u-s-critical-minerals-dominance/)

On October 6th, President Trump [approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/decision-of-the-president-and-statement-of-reasons-on-2025-ambler-road-appeal/) the Ambler Road access project in northwest Alaska. The decision [approves the appeal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/decision-of-the-president-and-statement-of-reasons-on-2025-ambler-road-appeal/) made by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA), the public-private corporation sponsoring the project. 

The Ambler Road is a proposed 211-mile private road that will unlock access for exploration and development of significant quantities of zinc, lead, silver, cobalt, and copper. Of the route trailing east from Alaska’s Dalton Highway, about 24 miles is on federal lands in the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. This stretch of federal land triggers permitting by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

The permitting history of the not-yet-built road is long. Access to the mining district is promised under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which clearly states that “the \[Interior\] Secretary [shall permit](https://www.nps.gov/locations/alaska/upload/anilca-electronic-version.pdf) such access” to the district. Earnest planning began in 2015, and in July 2020, the Trump administration approved the road with a 50-year right-of-way. In June 2022, the Biden administration voluntarily suspended the permits and redid its environmental statements before [shutting down the road](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-contradictions-of-biden-climate-policy-in-profile-alaska-mining-3857168e?st=Ty2mR4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) entirely in 2024. In June 2025, AIDEA appealed the decision. 

The Interior Department’s rationale in 2024 was laughable: Since ANILCA only explicitly mentions the Parks Service, it claimed that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) doesn’t have to issue permits. This argument was the subject of the appeal judged by the White House. President Trump’s full 27-page statement of reasons [can be found here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025AmblerRoadAppeal.decisionofthepresident.final_.rel_.pdf). 

Political squabbles over natural resources hurt Alaskans waiting on the promise of good-paying jobs. The fact sheet claims that the construction of the road will directly support [2,730 jobs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-approves-ambler-road-project-to-unlock-alaskas-mineral-potential/) and provide $1.1 billion in revenue to the state of Alaska from mining license tax revenues, corporate income taxes, production royalties, and claim rents. The White House’s [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-approves-ambler-road-project-to-unlock-alaskas-mineral-potential/) notes that there are more than [1,700 active](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-approves-ambler-road-project-to-unlock-alaskas-mineral-potential/) mining claims in the Ambler mining district, which have thus far only been accessible by air or winter ice roads. 

While projects seldom see unanimous support, many tribal leaders have recognized the economic benefits of the road. The late Wilmer Beetus, chief and mayor of Hughes, Alaska, [said in 2023](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-contradictions-of-biden-climate-policy-in-profile-alaska-mining-3857168e?mod=saved_content) that the project “is an opportunity to create high-paying jobs within the region so that our tribal members and their families can remain in their communities.” 

Opposing domestic mining projects also hurts those who want critical minerals for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. These minerals have to come from somewhere, and that is most often from overseas mines controlled by China that do not adequately protect the environment or worker health and safety. The Ambler Road’s [environmental plans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-approves-ambler-road-project-to-unlock-alaskas-mineral-potential/) build in “extensive mitigation measures, including caribou protection policies and fish passage culverts,” and any mines built in the area would be subject to the U.S.’ strong environmental protections. 

The Ambler Road is a test of whether the United States is serious about securing its own supply of the critical minerals that power modern life. The law is clear, the economic promise is real, and the environmental safeguards are in place. Alaskans shouldn’t be held hostage to years of bureaucratic delay and political posturing. The Ambler Road can prove that responsible natural resource development and environmental stewardship go hand in hand.

# Oct. 8th, 2025~U.S. Navy’s F/A-XX Selection Might Happen Soon – Reports

[U.S. Navy’s F/A-XX Selection Might Happen Soon - Reports - The Aviationist](https://theaviationist.com/2025/10/08/usn-f-a-xx-announcement-imminent/)

[The concepts of the two contenders for the F\/A-XX aircraft, Northrop Grumman \(left\) and Boeing \(right\). \(Image credit: Northrop Grumman and Boeing, edited by The Aviationist\)](https://preview.redd.it/m3r22iiv62uf1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=92f08a2a9cd2fd6e1e5199a97f0e24597c7ea5cd)

**After months of delay, Hegseth has reportedly greenlit the U.S. Navy’s F/A-XX program, with a selection expected as soon as this week.**

After months of delays and speculation, the U.S. Department of Defense, now Department of War, appears ready to select the contractor that will build the Navy’s next-generation carrier-based fighter, the F/A-XX. [According to *Reuters*](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pentagons-hegseth-okays-us-navy-next-generation-fighter-sources-say-2025-10-07/), Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the decision on Oct. 4, 2025, paving the way for an announcement that could come as early as this week.

The program aims to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets, which are currently being upgraded to serve until the new fighter is fielded. The [F/A-XX](https://theaviationist.com/2025/08/07/northrop-grumman-f-a-xx-concept-art/) will be the centerpiece of the service’s future carrier air wings, operating alongside the F-35C Lightning II and future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) unmanned platforms.

# Will it Be Really Announced?

*Reuters* quoted a U.S. official and two people familiar with the decision in its report about the development. [*Breaking Defense* also reported the news](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/10/navy-fighter-next-gen-faxx-boeing-northrop/), quoting two sources who also mentioned rumors about the selection’s announcement possibly arriving during President Donald Trump’s visit to the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier for the Navy’s 250th anniversary last week.

It is important to note, however, that this is not the first time such reports have emerged. In fact, immediately after the announcement of the [Boeing F-47’s selection](https://theaviationist.com/2025/03/22/everything-we-know-boeing-f-47-ngad/) for the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), sources said that the F/A-XX’s selection was also imminent, but then no announcement was made.

[Edited version, with the text removed, of the image published on Northrop Grumman’s website for the F\/A-XX concept. \(Image credit: Northrop Grumman, edited by The Aviationist\)](https://preview.redd.it/bbjklyi072uf1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=320a8b80915186a4c9d50bde45d5d900a4f6ac97)

This was also highlighted by *Reuters*, quoting a source who said that “ last-minute snags have delayed progress on the Navy jet in the past and could do so again.” The Navy and the Pentagon did not release official statements on the matter.

# Boeing and Northrop Grumman Face Off

As it emerged so far, the competition appears to have come down to Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In fact, Lockheed Martin, which produces the [F-35C](https://theaviationist.com/2025/02/08/f-35-dual-gbu-54-ljdam-drop/), is not among the contenders as earlier this year its proposal reportedly failed to meet Navy criteria.

Both Boeing and Northrop Grumman have deep histories in naval aviation. Boeing, after acquiring McDonnell Douglas, currently manufactures the [F/A-18 and EA-18G](https://theaviationist.com/2025/08/04/us-navy-fa-18-ea-18-12-million-fh/), while Northrop Grumman is the result of the merge of Northrop and Grumman, which last served as a prime contractor for a carrier fighter with the F-14 Tomcat, in the1990s.

The winning design of the F/A-XX program will define the next era of U.S. carrier aviation.

Both companies already have big ongoing programs for the U.S. military. Boeing is already producing the F-15EX Eagle II and the new F-47, while Northrop Grumman is working on the [B-21 Raider](https://theaviationist.com/2025/09/12/usaf-releases-photos-second-b-21/) stealth bomber and the Sentinel ICBM.

# Sixth-Generation Fighter

Although details remain classified, the [F/A-XX](https://theaviationist.com/2025/08/30/boeing-unveils-new-f-a-xx-rendering/) is being described as a sixth-generation aircraft which features enhanced stealth, greater range and endurance, advanced sensor fusion, and seamless integration with autonomous systems and carrier air defense networks. The aircraft is being developed with an emphasis on deep-strike capabilities and data-centric warfare, essential for future operations in contested environments like the Indo-Pacific.

Similarly to the Air Force’s NGAD, the F/A-XX will act as the quarterback for unmanned assets, exploiting the [Manned/UnManned Teaming](https://theaviationist.com/2024/05/03/new-sotware-f-18-pilot-commands-mq25/) (MUM-T) to reduce risk to manned aircraft while achieving air superiority and sea control. Top Navy officials are calling the F/A-XX essential for maintaining the carrier strike group’s relevance in future high-end conflicts.

The Navy’s first production F/A-XX aircraft are expected to enter service in the 2030s, ensuring carrier strike groups remain effective and relevant well into the 21st century. The [Super Hornet fleet](https://theaviationist.com/2025/02/07/usn-irst-ioc-super-hornet/), meanwhile, will continue operating into the 2040s to ensure a smooth transition to the new aircraft.

# Political Delays and Funding Battles

The selection process has faced months of uncertainty. As *Reuters* reported, disagreements between the Pentagon and Congress over funding and schedule led to repeated delays throughout spring and summer. The Pentagon initially requested only $74 million to sustain minimal development work, reportedly due to concerns over industrial capacity.

The service responded by placing a $1.4 billion request on its FY2026 Unfunded Priorities List to secure the contract and prevent delays. Lawmakers allocated $750 million to accelerate the program through the summer’s defense spending bill, followed by an additional $1.4 billion for Fiscal Year 2026 as part of the 2026 Fiscal Year Defense Appropriations Bill.

Adm. Daryl Caudle, Chief of Naval Operations, testifying at his confirmation hearing, highlighted the[ importance of this program for the service](https://theaviationist.com/2025/08/30/us-navy-eagerly-awaiting-f-a-xx/). “The Navy has a validated requirement for carrier-based sixth-generation aircraft, and it is critical that we field that capability as quickly as possible to give our warfighters the capabilities they need to win against a myriad of emerging threats,” said Caudle to lawmakers.

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.

# 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 ~BELOW~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp: Washington Convergence — From Policy to Core Sample

**J.P. Morgan • EXIM • DoD • The Four-Metal Reboot Begins**

**Yesterday in Washington, D.C**., NioCorp’s CEO Mark Smith stepped into the spotlight at **J.P. Morgan’s Export Agency Finance Forum**, where U.S. policy, capital, and critical-minerals strategy finally intersected.  
**This was no routine appearance —** it marked the hand-off from vision to execution.  
EXIM and DFC financing frameworks are now **in active alignment** with DoD supply-chain mandates and the DOE-USGS critical-minerals matrix.  
For the first time, **all four metals** at Elk Creek — Niobium, Titanium, Scandium, and REEs **— are being positioned as one integrated national-interest platform.**

# 🔭 The Countdown to Mid-October — Data → Re-Rate → Demonstration

Nine new **infill boreholes** are the next ignition point.  
Results expected **mid–late October** could confirm expansion toward **1 million tonnes TREO**, resetting Elk Creek’s valuation base and triggering institutional re-ratings ahead of the **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)**.  
That DFS will finalize **capex, opex, NPV, and RailVeyor efficiencies** — the last technical step before **EXIM’s Final Investment Decision**.

# ⚙️ America’s Four-Metal Convergence — The Industrial Backbone Reborn

**Niobium** — ""The Quiet Giant""- Hypersonic alloys • Superconducting magnets  
**Titanium / TiCl₄** — Jet-age rebirth • Propulsion & armor supply chain  
**Scandium & Sc-Al Alloys** — **Gen-VI light-metal revolution • Drones / fighters / orbital platforms**  
**REEs (Nd Pr Dy Tb)** — Permanent-magnet core • F-35, naval, EV propulsion

All four are embedded within **DOE, DoD, and 2024 NDAA** frameworks — opening the path to **funding mandates, stockpile authorizations, and long-term sourcing guarantees**.  
Mark Smith’s Sept 8 Wainwright remarks signaled the alignment clearly:

# 🔥 The Ignition Stack: October → December 2025

**→ \*\*\*\*\*Mid-October:** Drill results — resource expansion + valuation re-rate  
**→ November:** Scandium alloy unveiling — first U.S.-sourced scandium metal of the century (DoD demo)  
**→ December:** DFS + EXIM FID — financing confirmation and offtake alignment

As the **F/A-XX stealth program** and next-gen hypersonic systems demand lighter, stronger materials, NioCorp’s **Sc-Al and Nb-Ti alloys** stand at the center of the design envelope.  
Yesterday’s Washington forum underscored it: **policy is ready, capital is engaged, geology is about to speak.**

# → The countdown to America’s next strategic metals era has begun.

# Elk Creek as a “U.S. National Security Asset"" moment has arrived — and the ignition window is wide open. 🛰️⚡
