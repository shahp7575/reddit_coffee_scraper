For a coffee maker, I am repairing, I need a PCB to flash code to the mainboard. I couldnt find a PCB with everything I needed broken out, so I made one. I use a 6 Layer PCB, only because its the cheapest way to get ENIG finish for me. Stackup is  SIG - GND - 3.3V - 5V - GND - SIG. As all inner layers are solid copper poors, I will not be including them here. All Vias will be filled and plated over, so silkscreen on vias shouldnt be a problem AFAIK

People watching…

Something I love to do during my morning coffee, walks in the park, or when it’s slow at work.

Different people,
discovering their own lives.
It’s fascinating to me.

Usually I don’t remember anyone…only seeing them once.
But you, I remember.

Sipping my morning coffee, I noticed you always slowed down during the spring to look at the blooming flowers.
Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into.

Chrysanthemums.

Those were your favorite.

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors.
You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen, while their  precious babies would be crying for food.

You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill.
Said hello to early morning joggers.
Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats that hung around the corner.

You seemed so kind-hearted.

I always wondered where you were walking too,
to your day job, I had assumed…

When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was 
you had quit to work some place else.
Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.

I could see you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing.

Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country…

That, I hope not.
Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love.

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey…the way you walked with confidence…

I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking…

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around.
A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my porch.
They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence.

But nothing is as interesting as you.

I missed seeing you.

So I’ll write it here for now.

To remember.

When I saw you on the news, that’s the first time I learned your name.

Anna. 

What a beautiful name…

From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many.

So this, I never would have expected.

It’s crazy that I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head.
But this was never part of it.

I’m sorry Anna. I’m sorry I never once introduced myself to be your friend.
I’m sorry this world is so cruel.
I’m sorry I couldn’t save you from the harsh reality of what we call life.
I’m sorry you didn’t get a fair chance for yourself to become happier…

I’ll promise I’ll collect all the Chrysanthemums I ever come across for the rest of my time, to honor you Anna.

1lf75ip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lf75ip,Don't even know where to start with my small living room,"These photos are a few years old (about 4), but not much has changed since then. The good news is - I finally have the budget to tackle this properly!

Here’s what I’m working with:

* The room is 4m x 5m.
* I have a ton of books, so I’d like to incorporate as many bookshelves as possible.
* I also have quite a few vinyl records, which currently live under the TV (photo 4), but they're running out of space.
* The record player is next to the TV, along with a PS5 and two standing speakers on either side of the TV cabinet.
* I’d love to keep the couch, table, and chairs. The coffee tables are optional.
* I’d also like to display 3–4 framed posters.

I was thinking about some kind of built-in or modular furniture along the TV wall that could hold books and records - but I honestly don’t know where to start with designing that. Any advice, layout ideas, or examples would be super helpful!

1lf73al,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lf73al,KUUGA: Thoughts on the Blue Sky Part 2,"Sorry for it being 2 parts I went above the character limit guess it's more than some thoughts.

Part 6: Daguva: Developing my Doom and Despair

              Before we mention him lets briefly go to Goma someone I have not mentioned before. Throughout the episodes due to him not following the games he was ostracized and bullied till he had a plan of stealing from Daguva and got some epic moments. Fighting a High ranked Gurongi was cool enough but Yusuke and Ichijo failing to defeat him even with the sonic wave generator made him awesome but then he was killed by Daguva. That final scene was so effective in the dread of daguva to come he was mentioned before as No. 0 then he got namedropped but we hardly saw him. Then he killed more Gurongi in a month then Yusuke did in the whole year they say to show not tell so they told first but then they absolutely showed. Goma got beat so hard and so fast. Ichijo and an injured Yusuke going forth into a dark forest to try to beat him again probably thinking they are going to die then after being scared myself of simply sounds we see Gomas’s corpse on the tree perfectly demonstrating his evil. Then of course all the PTSD like symptoms that Kuuga is facing even from his mere Prescence even without getting a clear view of his face. Then when his face is finally revealed I was like bahahaha because that was clearly a teenager why was I so scared of a teenager but the more I thought of it in the last 2 weeks of watching the last 8 episodes it clicked. That was a perfect showing of the immaturity of the Gurongi a teenager playing silly games with no regard for others and only trying to make himself feel satisfied that perfectly shows the Gurongi as a whole their existence is sad as they can never help others. Then daguvas character culminates when every other Gurongi has died. Killing several thousand people in the penultimate episodes embarrassing the newly revealed Super form and of course what he did to the sky. I do not know how Toei did it but all of Japan rained during those scenes if Kuuga is the blue sky of hope his defeat ended the sky and from then on, we only saw rain, night and snow. But with the final change of the theme song Yusuke soldiers on to the final fight. With Daguva having a very similar look to Ultimate Kuuga they are perfect mirrors in design and power but their heart and resolve could never be more different. One who had gained the ultimate power from the beginning used it to slaughter his own people playing games to terrorize others for his own smile this is why he lost as with his death he was satisfied. Yusuke had more to fight for he contemplated and debated the Ultimate power for its risks but he used his power to help every step out of the way and even only killing Gurongi when they were in the game of directly harming others. He fought for others smiles while sacrificing his own ready to die by Daguva or his best friend shooting him when he would go too far. And of Daguvas final scene of not the apexes of power but a teenager laughing and getting beaten up by a crying adult their characters are shown that despite all of Yusukes regrets his tears show his gentleness this is the most fear and pain in the entire series shown but he never let it stop him against the man who never knew any fear and pain.

              Part 7: Yusuke

              An absolutely great and well-rounded character both with and without the mask. The man with 2000 skills tbf looking at the rest of the essay already clearly shows who he is and why I love him so ill just reiterate my points. I would say that he is a good example of a flat character arc within the show and its others who change around him but despite that he shows so much of himself throughout not just how cool he is as a hero but how deep he is as a human. Yes, he builds up a smile and will always reassure us in the same way he reassures the children of the kindergarten but in private moments and in his dialogue, he becomes a well-rounded person behind the smile. How he acknowledges the disappointment of not being on time, how he jokes about his experiences and how he helps others especially. Yusuke does not necessarily have the solution but what he importantly has is trust and care. From kids with grief and growing pains to those who are bullied and burnt out he knows what to say not because he has the solutions but because he can hear you out and trust you as he will believe in you to find your own path to a smile. That is the ideal path to guide others. And in the kindness, he showed it begot more kindness as characters like Jean were able to further guide Enokida or his teacher knowing to trust his student to Yusuke. Make no mistake he as Kuuga is also as cool going through, poison, stabbing, electrocuting, being run over, and being sensory overloaded and continuing to fight is epic again he absolutely is afraid he is absolutely in pain but this will not stop Kuuga from protecting the innocent. He even regrets additional power for whatever it may do to him hence why the lead up to Ultimate is so meaningful his form is so strong not because of what he loses for power but of who he is in spite of the power. I wish to meet someone like Yusuke someday and to be worthy of being given a thumbs up as I go forward this is the last singular Rider show and is truly great because of him I will not regret too many Riders but I will always remember the man who went against everything to protect others smiles and for what ever I may learn I will never forget that ones first skill is knowing how to smile.

              Part 8: The Cast: Sacrifice, Smiles & Sensibilities

              A good main character attracts one to a series initially but a world full of great characters allows one to stay long term besides Yusuke himself this is the magic of Kuuga for me. As I said before the police procedural stuff was what initially interested me and this element adds to and helps with the depth of the characters, Kuuga cannot do everything alone and how he interacts and works with the others is a vital step in the journey of the show and the development of others. Take Sakurako a researcher with personal ties to the people that were killed by the initial Gurongi resurrection she and Jean are the only ones that are able to uncover the secrets of Kuuga. Up until the midpoint she is vital in uncovering important lore and details that help Kuuga win such as the additional forms and the entire Gouram arc even despite Yusuke’s own skills he relies on her hard work. The frustrations and tiredness are clearly shown on the coffee pot stuff show her love for her friend and her desire to help even if she cannot go to the battlefield like the others she is the heart of a good chunk of the series though if I may have 1 criticism for the show it feels like once all the translations stop and the final message of “Ultimate Kuuga” is uncovered she takes a back seat until Yusuke makes his final goodbyes to everyone this is to give room for the other characters though especially the one I will mention next. Enokida and her arc serve as a small subplot towards the latter half of the story one would initially think she would serve another support role in say researching Gouram or creating special bullets but she creates another emotional core within the story through her motherhood arc. It is subtle hints at first from her late nights and other researchers like Jean giving gifts for her son. Then later with phone calls with her frustrated mother alongside seeing her son and feeling him wanting to connect with his mother. Then just before Kuugas own final arc this story has its own culmination with her final choice and sacrifice to attend her sons school day or finalize the Gurongi bullets. A difficult decision I feel for any mother between duties of your child and work especially with all those lives on the line. The bullets manage to save the life of Ichijo giving him enough time to stall the Go leader as well as defeating the final 2 Gurongi besides Daguva. Despite her success she is racked with guilt for her unfulfilled promises towards her son but eventually with the help of Jean she is able to have more resolve she doesn’t talk about the greater Good or how her work is so much more important but she acknowledges her own failure and vows to make it up to her son going forward in the peaceful world created by Godai Yusuke. It is an important thing to show about what one must sacrifice to help others smile in doing so she nearly lost her own smile but now she realizes her shortcomings and is able to be better. It is a heartwarming scene knowing her son never hated her merely upset as we all would be and with the end of that arc, we see their pure love for each other amidst the circumstance that was difficult for everyone. Just wanted to mention that I like Jean as a character but I also had a really stupid prediction in the beginning that he was secretly Daguva cuz he was the only non-Japanese in the cast lol I feel so bad. The Police fore alongside Ichijo are a great support cast the special force assembled for the Gurongi threat are willing to lay down their lives for what is needed to protect then you have the department chief grappling with his own morals of protecting but also managing the orders of the people he answers to. This comes to ahead especially in the BeatChaser arc needing Ichijo to for once disobey him for the greater good. They then become valuable additional support for Yusuke going forward especially when Ichijo cannot be with him directly. Then for the human end we have Minori, The Pole-Pole crew and Yusukes sister. Those who have known Yusuke the longest are also those who give a glimpse of who he was and who he has become. Yusuke showing how great he is with kids is always great to watch especially how he helped those friends end their feud they fought but are able to go against their misunderstanding. The Pole-Pole crew gives an important dose of humanity for the show of those not directly involved in the conflict but also perhaps most affected by it Nana has experienced the loss of her acting teacher and a shockingly close call in the pool she is just a regular kid so showing her experience in this world is important she is able to joke, have a crush on Yusuke but also acknowledge her own feelings and difficulties she needs to work through she is continuously tempted to move back to safer places but her trust in Kuuga & her own resolve to pursue the dream of acting that will make her smile allows her to move forward despite her doubts. Tamasaburo is Yusuke’s employer and the manager he himself does not experience much but serves as a comforting and funny character to watch throughout the show, through him we learn of Yusuke’s travel passion and the death of his father that changed Yusuke in a way him becoming a fan of Kuuga was also a fun twist. Through his own words of a man that could be the closest to an older Yusuke we see a contemplative person that also serves as subtle nods to Yusuke’s own difficulties that Yusuke does not wish to share directly to keep others smiling from grappling with difficult emotions, to wanting to avenge those who are wronged as well as Yusukes increasing fatigue & of course Yusuke’s wanting to travel to preserve his own smile Yusuke may not say it but I am glad Tamasaburo is here to allow me to understand Yusuke just a bit more. Lastly are our 2 reoccurring characters with Minori and Yusukes teacher they have been said many times in the review already I guess but it remains to be said of their importance and own arcs despite having less screentime. Minori grapples with her grief early on and through her trusting Yusuke to fight the Gurongi she is able to smile again and try to form her own dreams with the death of her father still looming over her we see her find and become passionate again of the world whether it is through music or going through the same ruins with Jean it takes a lot to continue to smile but she is able to still try this then ended with a great scene with her and Ichijo a small taste of adulthood as well that people may need to look scary to do what needs to be done that this isn’t who they fully are just one part of them. Understanding that will allow her to handle herself better as she grows up. Then we have Yusukes professor in the forefront of several episodes regarding Yusuke helping people he is able to regain his love for teaching and further guide others through the new resolve of meeting the student he helped long ago. Then finally of course is Ichijo the deuteragonist just as valuable a character as Yusuke Godai he is the intermediary between Rider and support team and is able to fully introduce them later on. Through his cooperation Yusuke and then Kuuga is able to succeed in fighting the Gurongi. The character similarly shows his many facets throughout the show his serious side as well as his unwavering dedication and compassion for others and of course his own personal fondness for Yusuke. With only a special gun he risks his life every time especially in his confrontations with the Rose Gurongi. This just makes him more badass though untransformed he fights on for his duty. Through his acts he even impresses the Rose Gurongi with his competence with the then dilemma of the Linto becoming the Gurongi juxtaposed to the scene of the special bullets finally being able to kill them. A show of force but also with more people like Yusuke the Linto will not be so evil as long as we care to protect each other’s smiles we will not become them. Ichijos arc is about gaining trust for Yusuke in order to help others to trust his friend with his intel, his weapons and eventually even his life. Whether one is to read their relationship as romantic or platonic I go back and forth depending if its Tuesday or not it cannot be denied how great of a relationship it is. One of trust, care and sharing vulnerabilities heck even the other police force like them together. They are perfect partners in their duty to help others protect their smiles and through their cooperation and faith in each other they are able to smile with each other as well.

              Part 9: The End: To make people Smile

              Now we are at the end of our journey I am sad I will not be able to watch the series again for the first time but thanks to Yusuke I know to smile that I had good memories of the story in the first place. The final set of Gurongi and then Daguva mark this final third the Go or the High-ranking elite those who can potentially challenge Daguva himself they themselves also possess the alchemical changing and transformation of Kuuga as well. Their privilege is not arbitrary challenges but rather they can freely choose their targets and conditions albeit with a higher kill count requirement also want to mention the scarf dude such a great human design I do not vibe with his bird design as much sadly. Their powers require special circumstances and strategies to defeat especially their leader who has a similar amount of transformation’s as Kuuga. Amongst this is the looming threat of Daguva himself & the finalization of the research team’s technology to fight the Gurongi all the while Yusuke grapples with the knowledge of the Ultimate Darkness and his own power if left unchecked. One by One as the final Gurongi are defeated including again a great scene with the defeat of Goma the stakes rise and arcs are completed. Yusuke is finally introduced to the police force and everyone’s shared knowledge can be pooled together for their final moves against the Gurongi. Shoutout to the mention of the original Kamen Rider in ep 40 something him essentially teaching the next gen was a nice touch. The solace of seeing every character interact in one room is great to see especially them smiling. Goals are met and people try to move on as overall less people die due to their being less Gurongi. Minori is able to perform her passions despite the one assassination hiccup and Nana is able to go forth with her dream amidst the death of her acting teacher. Sacrifices are made as Sakurako didn’t do her thesis and Enokida grapples with her perceived inadequacies as a mother. As the character arc wrap up it culminates in the final few episodes. Short intermission to talk about ep 50 though I just find it funny it is the funniest part of Kuuga in my opinion and gives a hint of the slapstick I observe in later Rider entries also Sakurako does a Rider kick I loved that. At the eve of the final battle through stopping his own heart Yusuke unlocks his super form to defeat the Go leader which led to my favorite out of context translation I believe if you read this far you know exactly what I am talking about ep (46). We are riding high as there might be a chance Kuuga need not go Ultimate till I skipped to the next episode and this new form got defeated so hard basically in an offscreen horror flashback leading to the final 3-episode end arc for the series. The melody changed again in the final 2 days that I watched the series back to the first verse of the song to show me to trust in Yusuke again. Through the fear and pain, he can overcome it all just trust in him. Yusuke essentially goes on his death march after this scene knowing what he must do to win or even survive and that is to use the Ultimate power. From the Kindergarten Students, to the research team and one last checkup from his doctor. He is grappling with his future and wants there to be no regrets whatever may happen next. He finally reveals his secret to the Pole-Pole crew the last people that did not know then finally to Sakurako the one who helped him all this time but sadly cannot join the final battle. As Yusuke is as his most somber, we feel his words and the actions that helped the people he is talking to in what everyone thinks may be his final moments. As he reassures everyone, he is struggling with himself as Kuuga and Yusuke is a blue sky at his lowest moments we are greeted with Rain, The Night Sky and Snow. With the help of the tracking Bullets, he makes his final approach to the mountain of his dreams with his most trusted friend. With the damaged Arcle he entrusts his friend with his life that if he may stray from his path there is a way to put him down. For the Final Henshin in the series we see him go into his Ultimate Form as Daguva congratulates him but Yusuke is not happy for the power he yields. It is an epic no trick fist fight in their transformed forms to start with minimal effects only needing the connection of the characters as well as to feel the strength of the punches. But now the highlight begins with both in their last legs untransformed & Bloody. Daguva relishing in the moment finally having an opponent that can give him fear and pain with his final blows he laughs compared to Yusuke through his cries he is afraid for his life and others if he cannot defeat Daguva and is in so much unbelievable pain but through it all he cannot stop Daguva must be stopped so the smiles of his friends can be protected. Then both are lying down near death in the snow in the forms of not Ultimate Power but as men then the episode cuts with Ichijo screaming for his life. 3 months later despite everything life goes on and the sky is blue again. The Special force has been disbanded & Enokida is able to dedicate time to her son again. But the best moment is the baby finally being seen because of Yusuke that baby is able to smile in this world. Through it all we hardly see Yusuke but his presence is felt throughout the joy he has given and the lives he has saved & enriched. After all that we realize why Yusuke was never corrupted by ultimate power unlike the Gurongi defined by personal ambition and hate Yusuke’s selfishness and kindness gave him ultimate power it was not because of the power that made him so strong but it was his inner strength that gave him power without losing himself. I will just like them cherish my time with Yusuke Godai. Then as the series closes it is not with an epic fight but one last act of kindness in an unknown tropical island Yusuke sees children fighting a diverse group of many races and nationalities, he performs his juggling act and helps them set aside their differences to be better and continue to smile. To be a better world we need not the strength of Kuuga but the kindness of Yusuke Godai and to vow to

                MAKE EVERYONE SMILE

 

Thanks for reading some of my thoughts it is appreciated. I can edit the format to something different if someone comments since I am going to do this for every series I have strong opinions on not all of them I cannot promise that.

 

TLDR: Love the show and I will miss there being only 1 rider shows yet excited still for how the formula will change and Journey through the Decade. Also, if I misunderstood something symbolism wise or there is extra info in the twenty years that I missed feel free also I watched the translation where the Gurongi’s language wasn’t subbed.

Now onward to a World of Lords and an amnesiac Rider in Agito looking forward to G3 the most.

So I (M45) went on a date with someone my friend set me up with. A woman she worked with.

Not drop dead gorgeous but not ugly by any means. But something was off with the way she looked and I couldn’t place it. But I went ahead with the date. We had some drinks, ate some food, threw some darts, talked about movies and video games. She invited me to her place for some coffee and while we were drinking coffee she told me she wanted to sleep with me but she wanted to tell me first, well, long story short she had a penis. I was instantly turned off. I have nothing against trans people I just prefer vagina. I didn’t say anything bad, I don’t think. I mean I wasn’t like “ew gross no thanks”. I tried to be polite as possible. I said thanks for letting me know, and I had a great time but I’m not interested in sleeping with a trans woman. Suddenly I’m the scum of the earth, transphobic, homophobic, everything phobic and people like me are what’s wrong with the world and I probably voted for trump (I didn’t vote at all). Anyway, I did have a great time with her and I was prepared to continue spending time with her platonically, until she exploded like that. And yes, I’ll admit I lashed out in kind when she started berating me and I called her a dude and said I wasn’t gay. But none of that happened before she attacked me verbally. So I left and a day or two went by and I get calls from my friend saying this chick is spreading all kinds of horrible news around her job about their coworkers friend so now she’s caught in the middle of it all.

Anyway, I’ve never done one of these before so I don’t know how to end it. I just want to know what other people think, AITA for not wanting to sleep with her? I know I’m the ahole for lashing out when she exploded. But what about before that?",1,1750327162.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,0,1.0,False

It took just under 2 minutes. What is funny is that the espresso itself doesn't taste bad, it looked bad, didn't have that lovely golden gloopiness I was hoping for, and the taste is not what I was expecting. This coffee often has low acidity, high sweetness, almost certainly toasted to be best drank with steamed milk, this shot has no sweetness, it is almost entirely savoury. It tastes like incredibly rich beef stock, the kind you might find in some incredibly high end restaurant, notes of red wine, the fatty marbling you get from a slow roasted brisket. It is intense and strange, but not bad. I won't be repeating this anytime soon I don't think.

We don’t post much, but after working with local businesses for a while, we figured we’d share a few lessons we’ve picked up—especially for anyone here running a business, launching a project, or wrestling with design on a tight budget.

We’ve worked with everyone from coffee shops to nonprofit orgs to real estate agents. And here’s what comes up over and over:

**Design isn’t just decoration.** Most folks think graphic design is about making things “look better,” but honestly, it’s really about making things *clearer*. Whether it’s a flyer, a menu, or your website—if the design isn’t guiding people to what matters, it’s holding you back.

**Consistency matters way more than complexity.** A clean, consistent look builds more trust than something super flashy but disconnected. We’ve seen DIY designs with 5 fonts and 8 colors—it’s confusing, not creative.

**Local context goes a long way.** We’re based in Boston, so we design with that mindset—what makes sense for this city, these people, this market. Not every solution works everywhere, and that's okay.

We’re not here to pitch anything. If you’re trying to DIY your branding or struggling to make a flyer that *actually gets read*, we’re happy to chat and share what’s worked for others around here.

""Yes, what do you want?"" I ask tiredly, looking up at him, with that obnoxious smile of his.
""I was just wondering, do you have the time to print these documents out?""
I want to say no, but my logicality gets the better of me and I answer, as kindly as possible: ""Yeah, of course I can""
""That's what we like to hear!"" He smiles as he continue walking through the corridor.

As I'm going to the printer room, I look out the window, watching over the city, with the busy streets and bustling shops. And I get the urge to escape, run out the building and leave everything behind.


Brainstorm POV:
""Three hours more, three hours and then my shift is over"" I say to myself quietly. The job at the coffee shop is draining me, but I need the money, so I persist. 
""Excuse me, could I order?"" A customer wakes me up from my trance.
""Yes, what would you like?"" I say, trying desperatly to appear like I care.

The customer orders and I go back to daydreaming, there aren't many customers this time of day anyways.

But then I once again get interrupted in my daydresming, when a woman, dressed in a blue suit walks up to the counter.
""I'll have whatever the last guy took"" she says. It's obvious how tired she is, so I take her order quickly. But even when she goes and takes a seat, I can't look away from her.

She's, cute? Or hot? I don't know. It wouldn't be the first time I've found a woman attractive, but there is something special about her.


Blueprint POV:
That girl at the counter, I can't stop thinking about her. I want to say I like her, but I'm straight as a stick, so I can't be attracted to her, right? I've always thought so atleast, but now that I think of it, I've never been attracted to a man either.

I drink the last of my coffee, and head out the door. The sun is setting outside, and I better get home before it gets too dark. But I can only think of one thing, and it's that damn girl at the coffee shop. Everything about her seems so, perfect. From the full beige outfit, to her red eyeshadow. 

I'm not in love with her, not at all, but why do I constantly think about her then?


Brainstorm POV:
The pretty lady in the suit walks out the door, and I already miss her. Those clear blue eyes, her soft voice. She is so fucking beautiful, but chances are I'll never see her again.

I love Stephen King, I love Still Wakes the Deep, and I have come to notice that elements of Stephen King's stories are present in Still Wakes the Deep, which I felt I had to share here because I am incredibly passionate about both, with my favorite King novel being The Shining, and Still Wakes the Deep being my favorite horror game. The first detail I'd like to highlight are the characters. The characters in Still Wakes the Deep feel fully fleshed out and each character has their own story and details about them which make them feel unique and human, when characters like Roy and Caz chat together, or when Finlay and Brodie put their plans into action, and even POS characters like Addair and Rennick are humanized, with Addair being a family man and loving his kids, and Rennick not even wanting to be on the rig but back home with his grandkids, the Beira D's crew is incredibly human, even when it's not, and Siren's Rest has expanded upon that. It's done well too, making us love our heroes and hate our villains. Stephen King often starts his stories building his characters and their personalities before introducing the horror into the story, to make their actions more believable when the ""horror scenario"" arrives. 
Speaking of which, my next point is said scenario. Eldritch horror is not something beyond the realm of King's writing, even a being of flesh that was stirred from beneath the crust of the earth and rises from beneath the waves to alter everything in its path does not seem like it would not belong in a King novel, The Shape is vast and inhuman in nature, like the Crimson King, a villain whose reach is beyond comprehension, its unknowable even and >! it's almost psychic-like abilities seem like they belong in King's stories,!< what with Kings love for psychics for some reason. 
My last point I'd like to make is the nature of the story, this isn't just about good vs evil, it's about humanity vs inhumanity, a theme often found in King's stories, and a central theme of Still Wakes the Deep, The Crew of the Beira D vs the Shape, struggling to stay human and keep some semblance of control, it's reminiscent of how the Losers Club took on Pennywise in ""IT"" or the feelings of isolation found in ""The Shining"" >!Even at the end of the game, when Caz kills the Shape, King's theming is layered in there too!< The theme of Confronting what you've been trying run from, whether it be your inner demons, the law, or something bigger than you could realize, it's a very personal obstacle that we all face and makes us all human. To summarize, both King and the Chinese Room know how to make characters human, and how to make is love them, both know how to treat horror, and know what we are afraid of deep down, and both know how to have our beloved characters interact with it, and the symbolism and importance behind it.

There are also studies that finasteride affects prepulse inhibition in stressed rats:

I think taurine is helping me with those problems.

Looking for a better way to organize your sales leads and all the follow-up activities that go with them? Instead of generic items like ‘Item 1’, ‘Item 2’, and ‘Item 3’, imagine renaming them to reflect your actual leads—like ‘John Smith’, ‘Mary Wilson’, and ‘David Johnson’. But what about tracking every detail of your follow-up process for each lead?

Adding each task as a subitem is one approach, but it can quickly make your boards cluttered and hard to manage, especially as you add more layers of detail. That’s where [Unlimited Subitems](https://monday.com/marketplace/listing/10000133/unlimited-subitems#overview) comes in.

With Unlimited Subitems, you can break down your workflow into as many levels as you need—keeping your board tidy and organized. For example, you can have ‘John Smith’ as your top-level item, ‘Follow up’ as a subitem, and then break that down even further into individual sub-tasks like ‘Phone call’, ‘Email’, or ‘Coffee catch-up’. Each sub-task can be tracked, updated, and managed independently, giving you a clear and detailed view of your progress without the mess. It’s a simple way to stay on top of every detail and keep your board looking clean!

I'm F40, my partner is M40 and my friend F40","I (F40) and my partner Jake (M40) have been together for a year, although we have known each other since we were 16yo. When I was 25 I left the country and we were always friendly through social media, meanwhile he married and has a 13 yo daughter. 2 years ago he separated and he's now finishing his divorce due to his ex cheating on him for a long period of time. His situation has been very complicated and when we met again a year ago neither of us wanted a relationship at all, but it was inevitable when we met for a friendy coffee; it was as if life had been waiting for this love to begin!Since we started seeing each other, we have always met at my place, a room that I'm renting from a friend (Sarah, F40) because after Jake's divorce he had to go live with his mom . Sarah has also divorced from a 18year relationship and she's all about living single for the rest of her life with her girl-friends, kind of like ""The Golden Girls"". From the beginning of my relationship she has been opposed to it, and has never said anything positive about me being happy with Jake or anything related to our relationship.She even gets upset if I spend time with him in my room. Jake and I typically only see each other on the weekends, and obviously we want to spend time together and he stays a night or 2 with me, but  Sarah has told me clearly that she isn't happy with this arrangement and that she doesn't want Jake to be here as much. The flat is on her name and she initially rented me the room supposedly for a short period of time. But I've been a little over a year here. I feel like I'm not welcome anymore and that she is trying to block my relationship with Jake. Due to Jake's recent divorce and complicated situation, in the beginning he wasn't open about being seeing someone with his family or friends, because he was afraid that it could affect on the custody of his daughter. In the last few months I have met 2 of his sisters and some friends, and everyone knows that he's seeing someone, although we haven't met in person yet. He has been trying to be cautious regarding the situation with the custody, but my friend thinks that he's playing with me and that I am giving everything and he's not providing anything for [me.In](http://me.In) my opinion she's afraid that I won't be in her Golden Girls group and I guess she's jealous that I am so in love and my partner reciprocates the love. I'm not sure what to think anymore. I am very unconfortable staying here now, and the next step would be for Jake and I moving in together, which is totally in our plans, but he's trying to buy a house, which isn't that easy when you don't have a lot of money, so it's taking longer than expected. On the other hand, I don't know his daughter yet because she's been very rebelius since the divorce and taking advantage of the divorce to do whatever she pleases. This makes it really hard for us because once they have the shared custody she'll have to stay a week or 2 per month with us.Does this relationship make sense?

Speaking to man for 4 months. Chatting every day and met up about 10 time, mostly his house. Have also done walks and coffee. 

He likes to take things slow (fine with me). Slept together about 3rd or 4th time we met up. Have slept together every time since. 

He won't take me on a real date because he isn't ready for that. So I asked if this was FWB and it's okay if so, I just want to know where I stand. He said no. He's told his family about me (I don't know to what degree).

But 4 months, no real date. Obviously he is getting everything he wants from me... my attention and sex. 

I'm half holding onto hope that he will step up. But also enjoy what we have too much to walk away because I also enjoy the attention and sex from him. But ultimately, I'm already starting to want more. 

I feel stuck. I've toyed with the idea of speaking to other men and move on already but I can't get past a very small chit chat conversation without thinking 'no I only want him'. ",3,1750325110.0,AskMenAdvice,11,1.0,False

It was already a pretty shitty day to start with. I woke up with a crummy headache, there was no milk for cereal, and I’d completely forgotten about an essay which was due. 

It was April Fool’s day, and I was looking forward to seeing chaos ensue at school. 

It usually did. It was always a competition amongst the students who could do the wildest prank, and that year was no exception. The whole school was eager to take Melanie Topper’s crown (The 2019 winner. We don’t talk about 2020) after she’d somehow convinced everyone the world was ending by broadcasting one of those mock emergency alert alarms. 

*Earth is under attack!* Every tannoy in school screamed at 9am, when the majority of us were still half asleep. She even played the siren, so you can imagine how fucking terrified we were. I fell for it, of course, being a confused freshman. 

Still half asleep from the Netflix binge the night before, I almost shit myself. Melanie had gotten suspended for it, though her argument had been that she’d been mimicking the famous War Of The Worlds radio broadcast for an assignment.

She definitely scared us, so congratulations to her… I guess. Since then, Melanie had held the top spot. Kids wanted to follow in Melanie’s footsteps. 

I’d caught offhand conversation and word of mouth that the next April Fool prank was going to knock Melanie off the top spot, and my best friend was eager to be the one to do it. I wasn’t really thinking about Rory’s prank, though. 

I had things on my mind that morning. Connor Marlow, to be specific. I’d been crushing on him for a while. You know, the butterflies in your stomach kind of crush. I don’t know what it was about him. He wasn’t exactly conventionally attractive. Connor looked like he’d rolled out of bed most days.  

He had dark hair and wore a lot of plaid, always carrying his beaten up camera everywhere, hanging on a ribbon around his neck. He was kind of awkward, but the cute kind. The kind that made me sort of fall for him. We were friends, meeting in the school newspaper club. 

Connor took his work a lot more seriously than me, though we’d hung out a bunch of times, and being a naïve idiot, I’d taken that as a sign that he actually liked me. Which was badly miscalculated on my part. If I’d actually  listened to word of mouth from classmates, I’d have found out Connor wasn’t really into girls. 

It was much later on– post the end of the world– when I found out about him, but at that point I was completely deaf and blind to any rumors.  I had already gone through our hypothetical conversation a thousand times in my head. 

The world could end. That’s what I’d told myself, rubbing my clammy hands together. Then what would I do? I’d regret not telling him.  I was also running on three cups of coffee, maybe four, so I was bouncing with unhinged energy. 

“Hey, Connor.” I caught him on the way to class.

As usual he was in his own world, thoughts in the clouds, nodding his head to music in his ears. I had to tap him on the shoulder to get his attention. Twisting around to face me, Connor’s frown quirked into a smile. He tugged an earphone out.  

“Mara.” He nodded at me, gesturing ahead. “Are you coming to class?”

“If I have to.”

Connor laughed. His laugh was one of the things I loved about him. The thing about Connor was, we only really talked about school work and the club. So, it was fairly easy to run out of things to say.  

What can I say? I spent most of my time on Tik-Tok, and he was into, like…I don’t know. Pretentious stuff? He’d watched the Midsommer directors cut at the movies and spent almost an hour talking about the cinematography, and how it was a masterpiece. The only thing I knew was that there was a guy who was put into a bear, and something about period blood. 

That’s it. 

When I told Connor this, he looked offended. So, yeah, we didn’t share interests, and maybe he was slightly on the pretentious side, but hey, I couldn’t help who I fell for. Connor just made me dizzy. The two of us started walking and made idle conversation about the weather and class work, pushing through the crowd of kids heading to first period.

Connor didn’t really speak, only offering me awkward smiles, his gaze flicking from me to his phone in his hand. He probably wanted to put his earphones back in. 

I suddenly had an overwhelming urge to bury myself in the ground. 

“Is the school newspaper club still tonight?” I asked him, knowing it was. 

The school newspaper held their meetings every Thursday at 4pm in room 45HF, a music room. I usually spent sessions typing up random articles or doing my best to help Connor with whatever project he was working on. There were five of us. 

Me, Connor, a kid named James who never did any work and talked about his sex life in vivid detail, and Sara, a quiet girl who always brought cake from home for us. 

“Yep.” Connor popped the P, lifting his camera for emphasis, a grin spreading across his lips. He always got excited about his camera like a little kid. “I’m taking pictures of the new school gymnasium.” He shot me a hopeful look. “Do you want to interview the coach? You can come along.”

The idea of standing in the new school gymnasium which smelled like burnt plastic and bleach, interviewing Coach Croft who was *very* intense when it came to interviews, wasn’t exactly my idea of fun. 

Still though, I found myself nodding. 

“Yeah. Is Sara still doing the piece on cyberbullying?”

“Uh-huh.” Connor idly played with the string of his camera as we headed up the last few steps. There were a group of kids at the top of the stairs yelling. My stomach gurgled. I regretted drinking all that coffee. 

“James is doing an article on the  girls swim team.” He shot me a grin. “Obviously.”

I rolled my eyes.  ""What is there to write about?”

“No idea. But it’s James, so I’m sure he’ll figure something out.” Connor mocked taking a photo of me. “He tries too hard.""

After a moment, I just came out with it. I couldn’t stand waiting any longer. “Hey, do you want to hang out?”

We reached the top of the stairs, and Connor jumped up the last two, turning to face me. He did a head tilt thing, like he was confused. “Do you mean after the club meeting? “Sure! I can text Sara?”

Shit. He was totally oblivious.

“Actually, I meant the two of us.” I said. “Like, a movie, or whatever.”

Connor’s smile fell. 

Running a hand through his hair, he looked kind of horrified. “Mara, you’re a great friend, but I don’t really see you like that.” he sputtered out a nervous laugh. “I actually, uh… "" 

He was cut off by a loud bang, startling both of us. Twisting around, I glimpsed the source of the crash, a guy who had just walked head first into a locker. I vaguely recognised him. It was the kid who suffered from Narcolepsy. 

I remembered him becoming the talk of the school during freshman year when he’d sleep through his classes, even drifting off standing up.

It was kind of adorable until he was doing it all the time. Then he was collapsing in the corridor, falling down the stairs, and suddenly the student body saw him as nothing but an obstacle in their way. 

They called him a vampire.

The crowd of kids around us were laughing. The kid dropped to his knees to grab his laptop. “Oh yeah, I'm hilarious.” He grumbled. “All right, everyone. Get it all out. Let’s all laugh at the narcoleptic guy! Come on, get it all out!” 

His smile was mocking, then. He was practically egging them on. “Dude, just don’t come to school.” Joey Summers, a senior, standing a few feet away, spoke up. “If you’re going to fall asleep everywhere, stay at home. You’re just walking around like a zombie.”

The kid blinked. “And?” He sneered. “Zombies have rights too, Joey.""

Joey laughed. “Bro. You're so fucking weird.”

“Thanks.” The kid shot him a mocking smile. “Anything else? Or is that your daily dose of bullying?”

“Just spitting facts, man!”

""Spitting in my face."" The kid snorted. ""Were you dropped on the head as a kid?"" 

Joe's eyes darkened. ""What the fuck did you say, Vlad?"" 

""Vlad."" The kid seemed way too comfortable with insulting a senior he barely knew.  ""That's a good one.""

“Joey.” Connor spoke up. “Don't be an asshole.”

“I'm not!” Joey’s grin widened. “Bro walked straight into a fucking locker! I told him to go to sleep! Look at him, the guy’s a walking vegetable.”

The crowd tittered with Joey and the kid opened his locker and grabbed his books.

I noticed his hands were trembling.  “Keep fucking laughing, assholes.”

With him joining in with being the butt of the joke, however, the laugher faded into an awkward silence. Joey turned back to his friends, but the kid seemed genuinely confused, still half asleep. I was watching him blinking rapidly, disoriented and unsure where to go, when Connor stepped in front of me. 

“It’s not that I don’t like you, Mara.“ He said. “I just... uhhh…”

“It’s fine.”

At that point I would gladly welcome a meteor hitting the school.  “I obviously got the wrong idea.”

“No, no, it’s not that!” Connor was cut off when his phone vibrated. 

I felt mine too in my back pocket. 

It wasn’t just the two of us. I glimpsed other kids pulling out their phones, or if they already had them, frowning down at the screen. Connor wore a wry smile. “What’s this?”

“Don't look at that.” I said. “It’s just Rory’s April Fools prank.”

“Hm?” Connor didn’t look up from his phone. And looking around, he wasn’t the only one. I was reminded of Rory’s prank. 

“A meme?” I raised my eyebrows when she shoved her phone in front of my face earlier that morning. 

Rory’s smile was enough to brighten my mood. “It’s a Tik-Tok!”

“Yeah, I’ve seen it.”

“It’s funny!” Rory laughed. “Look at it!”

I pushed the phone out of my face, settling my friend with a smirk.

“Yeah, but I don’t think it’s April Fools worthy.”

Rory’s eyes glinted. “Not yet.”

Her words took me off guard. “Huh? What do you mean?”

Rory winked at me and ran ahead, and I had no choice but to follow her. “Hey, what did you do?”

Turning to me, Rory was grinning wildly. “I bought a thing.”

“A thing?”

“Yeah! It was only like ten dollars.” Her eyes were shining. “It’s a mass text!” She whispered excitedly. “Like, it connects itself to the network, to everyone’s phone’s, and everyone will see it. How cool is that?” 

Rory's grin was a little unnerving. “You can’t get rid of it either, unless you turn off your phone. It works like a parasite, spreading to all forms of technology, not just phones.” She turned to me with childlike glee. “Wait, does that mean every device? Like, school printers, too? Toasters?”

“No!” I shoved her, laughing. “They mean TV’s. Whiteboards. That kind of stuff.”

I was suddenly curious, because this kind of thing, despite being hilarious, sounded shady as hell.

“Where did you find it?”

“No idea. I had to download another web browser.”

I had a hard time taking in what she was saying. “Rory, did you..” I trailed off, unable to stop myself laughing. “Did you get this off of a shady Internet site?”

She shrugged. “I don’t think so? It was just a website.”

“Which sounds exactly like the Dark Web.” I groaned. “What even is it? Like a file?”

Rory nodded. “I guess? I don’t actually have it, I just have to give the go-ahead in the IT room.” She pulled something from her pocket. A USB drive. “They told me I just have to plug this into any computer, and they’ll do the rest.”

I stopped walking. *“They?”*

“Yeah, they were anonymous.” Rory turned to me, folding her arms. “Why are you looking at me like that?”

I continued walking, a little faster this time. “Like what?”

*“Like you’re about to say this is a bad idea.”*

Rory’s voice echoed in my mind as I watched Connor Marlow go fifteen seconds without looking up from his phone. But not just that. He’d seemingly frozen in place. I jumped when his backpack slid from his shoulder and hit the ground with a thump which didn’t even faze him. Behind him, a girl dropped her latte. 

Things were hitting the floor suddenly. Just normal objects. Laptops. Coats. Drinks.

But no phones.

Something ice cold slipped down my spine when Connor’s body seemed to contort, his fingers tightening around his phone. 

Maybe I was seeing things, but I *swore* his eyes lit up for a fraction of a second. 

Blue, like his eyes were igniting. 

His fingers clenched tighter, jaw slackening, drool pooling down his chin. 

I glimpsed a puddle of coffee seeping beneath my feet. 

It was almost like the world had come to a standstill around me. 

“Connor?” I managed to find my voice, reaching for my own phone. Rory’s video couldn’t have been that captivating. 

It was just a stupid meme.

And then, just like that, my world exploded.

I’m not sure when it hit that something was very wrong. 

Maybe it was when Connor Marlow lifted his head, the light in his eyes, that very human light that I’d recognise in any living person– fizzled  out. 

There was something in the air, something crackling, that I felt, sensed, heard. I was too busy staring at Connor, at the visible change in him; a transformation happening directly in front of me which carried in the air, seemingly taking control of every kid around me, bodies jolting, like something was there, crawling into their heads. 
 
Connor’s body seemed to relax, go limp. But he was still standing, like he was suspended on puppet strings. I was choking on words I wanted to say, wanting to cry out, when Joey Summers lunged for a girl near him, latching his teeth onto her throat and ripping it out. 

That started a domino effect. All around me, kids started attacking each other. A girl threw herself at two guys, and the group of them tumbled down the stairs, clawing at each other. 

Screams erupted around me and I was reminded of animals in a zoo. But they weren’t animals. They were my classmates. My gaze, until then, had been on Joey who was straddling the girl he’d ripped the throat from.

Zombies. That was my first thought.

But he wasn’t eating her. His expression was vacant.

The boy seemed to study her with empty eyes, before jumping up and taking off down the hallway and slamming, almost comically into a door. He was laughing, I realised. Joey was giggling like a child, slamming his face again and again and again into the door. Blood splattered, rich and dripping. 

The boy made a screeching noise, gouging his own eyes out. 

I was aware I was taking a slow step backwards, but I couldn’t tear my eyes off of him.

His body slipped to the ground before getting back up. 

BANG. 

His head bounced off of the door with a sickening splat. 

He was still laughing.

But he didn't stop until half of his head was hanging off, and yet his body continued, smashing into the door. A girl with a ponytail wrestled him to the ground. But the two of them were grinning, blank eyes wild, like they were enjoying it.

I couldn’t move.

Rory.

Her name clouded my thoughts. Rory, Rory, Rory. My trembling hands gingerly brushed the back of my jeans, fingering my phone. I wasn’t thinking. Fuck. I wasn’t thinking. I had to get to her. 

Cool hands were suddenly wrapping around my throat and choking the breath from my lungs. I was on my back, and Connor was on top of me. His eyes were different. Unlike Joey’s, unlike others around us mindlessly throwing themselves at each other, there was the slightest glint of awareness in his expression. 

A manic smile was stretched across his face. He was speaking, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. 

*""bllersghhhhhhhahaahahbaahahah?""*

I couldn’t breathe. With one hand still gripping my throat, Connor pawed for his phone that he’d dropped. I already knew what he was going to do, and I tried to fight back, tried to shove his body off of me. But I couldn’t. Not when he was squeezing the breath out of me.

Around me, I only saw pooling red. 

But no bodies.

Kids with pieces torn out of them, kids carrying their own entrails, torso’s that had been ripped into, spilling glistening innards. 

They were still moving, contorting around me. They ran and stumbled and crawled, all of them with one mindless goal. Unlike them, Connor was conscious. 

He was thinking, but his thoughts had been twisted. Giggling like a little kid, he shoved his phone in my face and I squeezed my eyes shut. He was conscious enough to want to show me the video, I thought dizzily. Why? Why had it affected Connor differently?

I didn’t have enough time to think because his thumbs were in my eyes, pulverising. And I was screaming.

“Looook at ittttt!” Connor’s voice was a hysterical giggle riddled with static.

The phone blinked on and off, on and off, like it was connected to him.

“Look at it!”

He got closer, his breath tickling my face. “Look at it, look at it, look at it!”

Tipping his head back, back arching, Connor’s eyes were lit up. And I was transfixed, somehow, by that light. His mouth opened, a smile stretching wider and wider and *wider*. He screamed, and his screech felt like a knife splitting my skull open. Pain exploded behind my eyes. 

Nuclear pain. Pain that I didn’t think was possible. When I cried out, he let go and shoved the phone in my face. I was looking at exactly what I’d seen earlier, when Rory had shown me. It was a fifteen second video, and the familiar audio from the meme. I didn’t see anything wrong with it at first, but it wasn’t the video that was the problem. 

It was what overlaid it, a high frequency screech rattling my ears. Connor’s head lolled to the side, his fingers scratching at my eyes. I was forced to drink it in. 

I won’t be fully able to write out what happened to me, because I still don’t know. I only remember splinters. I remember something snapping inside my head. I felt it, like something in my brain had been severed. Broken. Let loose. 

I remember a boy coming up behind Connor wielding a fire extinguisher and beating him over the head. Over and over and over again until he was nothing but unrecognisable squirming flesh still twitching on the ground. But I found it… funny. No, more than funny. 

Hysterical. 

I laughed, and others around me joined in. I laughed, and my thoughts grew blurry and disjointed. I stood up, swaying from side-to side, and I remember wanting the boy to do it again. I *told* him to do it again. I wanted to see Connor’s skull smashed in. I wanted to see his brains splattered on the floor, a look of hopelessness on his face. That's what I wanted to see. 

I wanted to see him scream. I wanted to see his pain. But I didn’t get that. Even when I grabbed the fire extinguisher myself and continued the assault, bringing it down on Connor’s head, what was left of his face didn’t lose its skeletal smile.

He didn’t die. Connor just lay there, his body rattling, trembling, his lips opening and closing, like he was still shrieking with laughter. Listen. I’ve wanted to skip over this part. I’ve wanted to lie to you and pretend it didn’t happen. But it did. 

I became a puppet to whatever was released, and my only thought was to cause pain. I killed people. I ate people, and nothing brought me more satisfaction than ripping into my own skin and mutilating myself. 

I was part of this sadistic hive mind, a group of kids with enough consciousness to know what they were doing, but the thing inside us, the thing wriggling inside our head, kept us on a leash. It told us to bark, and we did. 

It told us to hunt, eat, sleep, attack. And we did. Blackwood became a hunting ground. I’m not sure how long it was before I was knocked out from behind. 

I was on guard with two other girls, and, then I was staring at the ceiling, my weapon kicked out of my hands. The thing inside me didn’t like that. 

It told me to fight back. It told me to rip out my attacker’s throat. Then, though, something cold was slicing into the back of my neck, and it was the first I’d felt in so long. I’m not sure when the thing let me go, or it was forced to let me go, but when I fully came to, aware of all the shit I’d done, the kids I’d killed and tortured and eaten, I didn’t want to stay.

I wanted to die.

I could still taste them on my lips, tainted on my tongue. They tasted gross. When I fully came to, I was in a classroom. Or what was left of a classroom. The doors were barricaded with desks and chairs. 

The light above me flickered. I was tied down to a desk. My arms and legs were bound in rope, and something warm pooled down the back of my neck. 

There was something there, though, something soft, cushioning my throat.

“Well, well, well.”

A voice spoke up. There was a figure in front of me. “Welcome! Test subject number eighteen.” 

The shadow leaned forward, and I caught the scent of mint bubble gum. He jumped back when I inclined my head, my brain trained, moulded to attack. But the thing was gone. So, I just looked confused. 

The kid cleared his throat. “Forgive me for the restraints, but you have tried to kill me, like, seven times now. I counted.” 

He prodded my forehead, and I had to resist the temptation to bite him. “I’ve managed to get it out, aaaaand judging by your return to maybe-sanity it looks like it worked.”

He tightened my restraints. “Or I'm way too hopeful. You're kinda looking at me like I'm a walking Big Mac, Subject Eighteen.”

I couldn’t find my voice for a moment. The whole time I’d been a puppet under that thing’s control, I hadn’t really used my mouth. Instead my thoughts were projected between the hive mind we all shared.

“What?” I licked my lips. They tasted like rusty coins.

His sharp exhale of breath caught me off guard. “It talks.” He muttered. “That's new.”

When the figure in front of me moved closer, it caught the light. A kid my age hiding behind some serious bed hair hanging in his eyes. His sweater was discolored, a filthy lab coat draped over the top. But he had a human kind of charm. This kid looked like a *kid*. 

His smile wasn’t quite friendly. He looked more excited, like I was this cool new specimen he’d just put in a jar. This guy was definitely the neighbor's kid. “Even better,” he poked me again. “Subject eighteen appears to be speaking actual English.”

I managed to hiss at him, biting his finger. “What the fuck?”

The boy laughed. “Holy shit, you're back to normal!” His smile was sheepish. “Well, normal-ish. I can't reverse the psychological trauma, from the... you know... "" he mimed biting his own arm. 

Before I could speak, he cleared his throat. “All right! Let's get this over with.” 

The guy grabbed a notebook? And a pen, twirling the pen between his fingers. “Do you remember your name?”

I didn't. 

“No.”

The guy hummed. “Huh. Well, memory loss is common. You did, uh, come back from being a zombie-like psychopath.”

He scribbled something down. Though when I looked closer, he was just drawing smiley faces. “How about your age? Do you remember anything about yourself?”

I did. I remembered that last day. I remembered Connor Marlow. I remembered cracking his skull open. 

“No.”

His lips pricked into a smile. “You're not really a talker, are you?”

When I didn't respond, he ripped off his gloves. “You were preeeetty vocal as one of them. I remember you specifically chasing me down the math corridor. You really wanted to rip into my spleen for some reason.” I don't know what he expected.

*I'm sorry I tried to rip out your spleen?*

He slammed his notebook shut. “Forgive me for being gross, but you wanna see it, right?”

“See what?”

He chewed his pen. “What I got out of you.”

I was suddenly all too aware of the makeshift bandage around my neck.

“You got that thing out?”

He nodded. “Yeah. I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials.” The guy’s lip curled into a smile. “I used to have a *lot* of time on my hands.”

I struggled to take in his words. In my mind, it was a video that had fucked with my head, that had caused me to go crazy. 

“How did you get it out?” I managed. “What was there to get out?”

His eyes darkened. “I’m going to call it a root? I had to wait until night to try, and even then, it was a risk.” He paced up and down. “I figured out it seems to leave the brain during night while it hibernates. No idea why. Maybe it’s taking care of its host.” He twisted around to face me, eyes lit up on the fluorescent light. Not like Connor. That electrical sizzle around his iris. 

No, this guy’s eyes were coffee brown, and *human*. 

“Do ya wanna see it?”

Something inside my gut twisted.

“No.”

He pouted. “Aww, come on, it was part of you! Think of it like your little pet.”

Before I could respond, the guy wandered over to a small table and picked something up. When he practically danced back over, I braced myself. 

In his hands was a soda can. The kid peered at it. “Not the best container right now, but the science building exploded, thanks to you guys a couple of weeks ago.” Shooting me the side eye, his lips quirked into a smirk. “Not that I needed the equipment or anything.”

Holding the can close to me, he hovered it in front of my eyes. “See it?”

The thing resembled an octopus tentacle, a single root-like thing coiled at the very bottom of the can. “That.” The guy pulled the can away. “Is the unnamed meme virus.”

I blinked at him. “The what?”

He shrugged. “Let’s call it the SUU virus. I did think of Brain Rot, but it's too soon.”

I could only stare at him. 

“This thing was a video.” I whispered, swallowing barf. ""I watched a video.""

He nodded. “Well, yeah, it started as one. But shit evolves, dude. Have you played Plague Inc?”

The guy sighed. “You’ve been out of it for like, I don’t know, eight months? You've been guarding F Block stairs for maybe three months. That's how I caught you.” He shot me a grin. 

“Things have changed. April Fools Day, a mass text was sent to every device in the school and everyone who saw it lost their fucking minds. There are three categories. There are the Walking Dead rip-offs who rejected the virus and went full zombie mode. Then there are the successes. These are ones the virus aimed to make. An army of psychopaths.""

His gaze swivelled to me. 

“They hunt down kids who survived and keep their minds and force them to watch the video."" I noticed his eyes narrow, like he was holding back some serious resentment."" He snorted. 

“And that's if they're feeling merciful. Those guys are a whole other *level* of zombies. I've never seen this kind in the movies.” The guy’s expression crumpled, his lip curling with disgust. “You're like… mutations. Like a *super* mutation.""

He caught my eye. “Sorry. You *were* a mutation.”

The kid pointed to himself. “Finally, there are kids like me, who forgot to charge their phones that day.” He shrugged. “Or in my case, fell asleep. I tend to do that a lot.”

Before I could speak, he continued, gesturing around him. “All of us are living in a so-called Utopia, ruled by Aurora Michaelson, our creator, and so-called goddess.”

Sticking his fingers down his throat, he pretended to gag. “It’s messed up. Whatever that thing is, it’s taken complete control of her. She’s like their Queen.”

I went cold all over. “Rory?” I whispered. “Do you mean Rory?”

“Is that her name?” He pulled a face. “Yeah. I mean, you’ll know what I mean when you see her.”

“When I… see her?”

The kid frowned at me before sighing and undoing my restraints. He held out a hand for me to grab, and I took it. 

He pulled me off the desk. It took a while for me to steady myself, my arms windmilling. He caught me, helping me lean against the desk. “I’m Jasper, by the way! If that thing is still lingering inside of you and you try anything, I won’t hesitate killing you.” 

He smiled wryly, backing away. He was teasing, but his expression wasn't playing around. “No hard feelings?”

I struggled to steel myself, my head spinning. “How long have I been…” I trailed off.

“One of them?” Jasper strode over to the window and pulled back curtains spattered red. 

I followed him, hesitantly. There were bars on the windows. When I pressed my face against them, I glimpsed a flash of green outside. Jasper gestured to the bars. 

“They put us in quarantine a day after the outbreak. At first it seemed like they were helping, but the freaks just ate them when they tried coming in, and then you guys warned them not to step on territory. So, since then, they’ve pretty much given up on us. Pretty pathetic.""

I was already kneeling on the floor near the door, peering at vine like roots entangled in the hinge. “What is that?”

Jasper lost his smile. 

“When that thing can’t take control, it explodes in their heads. It doesn’t kill them, keeping the body alive and whatever that is sprouts from their head. It’s everywhere. All over the school. It started in the IT room and spread here.” 

The boy turned to me when I got to my feet. “There’s something else I should show you, but we have to be quiet, okay? At these hours your gang sleeps in the corridors, and freaks still roam around.”

He moved towards the door, and I followed. 

“Whatever this thing is, it’s intelligent, and built an army of sorts. The ones who didn’t go zombie have one mission, and that's to convert survivors. Anyone left lucid.” He shuddered. “They’re her so-called loyal followers, and they lost one of their pack."" He curled his lip.

""They’re probably looking for you, so we have to keep a seriously low profile.”

Jasper shot me the side-eye. “Unless you want to go back to them?”

Ignoring his snide remark, I focused on Rory. “I need to get her. Rory, I mean.”

“That doesn’t sound like a good idea. There are guards.”

“Do you know how to get past them?”

He groaned. “I’m working on it. I managed to brain you, didn’t I?”

Jasper removed the barricades and we stepped out onto the corridor. It was pitch black, though my eyes adjusted easily. He wielded a baseball bat and moved quickly, dragging me with him. Thick greenery engulfed the corridors, a root like plant tangled in every door. 

“If you see a phone, smash it to pieces in the daylight.” He said. I didn’t understand what he meant until we were kneeling in front of what was left of Connor Marlow. His body was still intact, still breathing, despite him being nothing but quivering flesh. Jasper used the sleeve of his sweater to pick up a discarded phone next to Connor. 

The screen flashed on and I flinched. Jasper lay a hand on my shoulder.

“Cool it, It’s dead for now.”

“For now?”

“Mmm. Look.” Jasper pointed to the screen where something flashed up. “They don’t show the video anymore, just this.” He sent me a look. “I’d advise smashing it to pieces during the day time though.”

His words twisted something in my gut as I peered at numbers in glaring green. It looked like they were counting down. “They’re all connected.” Jasper said, nodding at Connor, and the bodies around him.

“See? Whatever happens to them, the phones react to it. And vice versa.”

When Jasper hovered the phone over Connor, his body rattled, eyes flickering. Beneath me, the ground rumbled.
“What was that?” I hissed out.

“That.” Jasper murmured. “Is the latest update.”

He was right. Peering at the numbers, it was at 67% complete.

“Update.” I repeated. “For what?”

“No clue. This thing has been learning through us.” He swung his bat. “I’m gonna guess it’s bad, though? You know, considering they have the ability to shake the earth and play with the lights.”

As he said that, the bulb above us, the one that I thought was dead, sparked slightly.

Before lighting up.

I jumped up, something warm creeping up my throat. I was reminded of what I’d been eating for the last god knows how long, and I had to bite into my lower lip to stop myself barfing.

“Wait.” Jasper hissed out.

He fell to his knees, crawling over to Connor.

Jasper used the butt of his baseball bat to poke at something slithering on the floor next to Connor’s ear. “No way,” He hissed. “That's brain tissue."" Jasper said, his voice quivering. ""It's combined itself through our brain tissue and learned and evolved into a physical form.”

I peered at the thing, cringing at the way it squirmed. “That’s what you got out of me, right?”

The guy straightened up and turned to me. 

“Yeah.” His breath was shuddery. Jasper jumped back. “But it’s not supposed to be able to survive outside of us. The one I pulled out of you was dead the second it touched the can. If this thing can survive outside of us too, we’re fucked. Because what the fuck comes after *that?”*

He poked at the thing again, his voice a hysterical breath. He stamped on it, but when Jasper lifted his foot it was still wriggling, still squirming, before slithering back into Connor’s ear. 

Footsteps interrupted what I was sure was going to be a cry ripping from my throat. Running footsteps. 

Laughter. It was almost sing-song static noise which crackled in my ear.

“Marrraaaaaaaa?”

“Come and play, Maraaaaaaaa!”

Their voices were like a symphony in my ears, reminding me of my name.

I… felt them. If that makes sense.

I felt them coming closer. But the thing that had been inside me was gone. So why did I still feel tethered to them? I caught Jasper’s frightened eyes. “Mara.” He whispered. “Is that you?”

I could only nod.

“Well, shit. It’s your friends.” Jasper grabbed my hand, flattening us against the wall. “We should go.”

We found a classroom and barricaded the doors. They don’t try and get us at night.

That’s what Jasper said.

It’s only in the daylight.

That was three days ago. Since then, we’ve been here. We’re safe for now. I can’t stop thinking about this update. 

What does it mean? Jasper told me the internet has been cut off, but in the same breath he admitted that he’s pretty sure all of us together act like a modem. I don’t know how I’m getting a connection, but if anyone’s reading:

You have to help us. Get us out of here.

It’s weird. I haven’t had time to come to terms with what I’ve done yet. I know it will hit me soon.

I hope… God, I hope it’s fast.

Rory’s out there, and I’ve got to find her.

I know this wasn’t her fault. I know it.

1lf6ez1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1lf6ez1/rweightloss/,R/weightloss,"I started with just 3 liters of water a day… and everything changed.

Hey everyone,
I never thought drinking just water could make such a big difference. But it all started when I made one small change – drinking 3 liters of water every day consistently.

Here’s what happened in the first 15-20 days:

My cravings for junk & sugar reduced drastically

I felt more energetic and active, even without coffee

My skin started clearing up 🌿

I lost my first 2-3 kgs without any extreme diet

My mood swings and headaches became rare

And the best part: my sleep got deeper and calmer 😴


I also started adding a bit of lemon or cucumber in the water sometimes to keep it interesting.

This one habit created a domino effect – I started walking more, eating cleaner, and even joined a health program with a mentor. Now I help others do the same.

So if you’re stuck, try this:
👉 Start with just water discipline for 7-10 days.
It can literally restart your system – physically and mentally.

Happy to answer any questions or share tips.
Cheers to health 🥂 (with water 😉)

If anyone wants a simple “Water Habit Tracker” or “Fat Loss Routine for Beginners” – I’ve created a small guide. Just DM me, I’ll share it free 🙌

Now he had like a group of friends , and like I had a cousin there aswell , but more like dur ke rishtedar types, and she was very introvert, and I was pretty bored, but then his friends they were playing cricket , so they invited me, I gladly accepted! I had a great time, now as I was heading my room, I wanted something from my suitcase, but my brother he did the stupidest thing, he changed the password and then forgot it!

So I was panicking so one of the groom's friend A came and he helped me unlock that by a yt tutorial, and now here enters the main guy about whom this post is about , let's say B. So A is very focused in unlocking and be is just doing nothing and chatting with my brother, basically doing nothing. And then he tries to initiate a small talk with me. Now I didn't mind it tbh , but he looked like he was my age , atleast that's what I thought that he is brother of my cousin's friend. So we talked little bit. Now this guy next day out of nowhere starts bringing me things like water, sweets and and just finding reasons to talk to me. I didn't really mind, cuz I was like yeah he's just being nice.

Now the wedding day, so during the barat, ofc everyone was dancing, but he was also tryna get close not very close cuz like I had my mum and aunt , but like he was close , eye contact and stuff. But then he wasn't my problem my problem was that in barat there was this random uncle who I did not even know and he was just staring at me for like 15 mins , almost all the wayy. I was stressed about that, contemplating whether to tell mom ignore and just stare back in his soul, but I chose middle option. Then we finnaly reached the venue, that mf was still staring. So I told B that there's this weird guy, and he's just staring, he was yeah ignore n stuff, but I was like fine cuz I just had to share with someone. Then when we got in B went straight to the guy, and got in a argument with him , it lasted for like 3-4 mins, I couldn't even go stop him cuz my family was there. But yeah B came back and he was like he won't do that again, and I was like you did not had to do that, but yeah it ended there.

Then B was being all caring n stuff, like he complimented many times my hair and dress and stuff. and basically I was again bored so I was hanging out with him and other friends. It was chilly , and we decided to sit somewhere and as you know , the chairs were wet, it was an open venue, so he took he coat and cleaned the chair and was like sit. Ab yeh jada ho raha tha. But eventually we just started walking, I got myself a icecream , but like I was already stuffed as I had starters, so I ate like half and I was gonna throw the rest, and this guy he asked are you throwing it away , and I'm like yeah I'm stuffed. And he's like do you mind if I have it? Now I was stunned, and I did not know what to say, so I'm like but this is half eaten, and he's like that's the best part with a wink, and he took it. I was flabbergasted atp, but yeah then mom called me for pics and stuff.

Had dinner now again I did not take a lot, but like little rice was left, and he legit again came and sat beside me, he's like ur not eating? Can I ? I'm like sir ? wtf ? no ofc I did not say that but that was my inner monologue. But my mom was just beside me, I cannot risk it, so I'm like yeah I'll eat that in a while, you get yourself dinner. And now all were just leaving, like goodbyes n stuff was happening, again he came and sat beside me, And just mentioned that it's quite chilly, and I kid you not that guy, he starts removing his coat!😭 My family is literally beside me, so I deny him that it's fine and stuff and we leave.

Now next morning, I came late so ofc I slept till late , and he brings me coffee. Now imagine I woke up like 5 secs ago and he's next to me all ready and stuff, And just woke up! I'm embarrassed, but yeah I said thank you and went to take a shower. That day I had to leave . We had like a small talk , and then he told me he's 24! Like all this while I was like he's 18 but no! I was surprised but then I'm like nvm. So like after few hours I leave, and he did not come to say goodbye or anything and he did not ask for my number or anything.

And after like an hour I get a hi, it was him, prolly got my number from family group. I did not really mind cuz I was toh leaving, then when I reached home in evening, I get so many messages from his girlfriend which he had denied, that he had no girlfriend and she's furious and angry, like some 12 msgs and then she blocks me! I mean that was the weirdest thing to ever happen ? The guy who was acting all caring and stuff had a girlfriend all this while !?

TLDR : met a guy at wedding , he was hitting on me the whole time and being all caring and stuff , and the end got to know he had a gf all this while and she blocked me.",7,1750324737.0,AskIndianWomen,19,0.82,False
1lf6cig,https://www.reddit.com/r/traveller/comments/1lf6cig/npc_shipboard_situations_d66_table_make/,NPC Shipboard Situations  [D66 table] Make encounters feel alive (for Solo or GM Use),"*The ship collapses out of jumpspace and begins to make it's way deeper into a binary star system.*

*Long range sensors ping repeatedly as they detect a small cluster of ships nearby.*

Each has their own story to tell, what is life currently like on the other side of that hull?

How to use the table:

That’s up to you. Maybe every NPC ship gets a roll, or just half. Perhaps only 1 in 6 vessels has something unusual happening, while the rest are just quietly getting through their shift.

This is a companion table to the one I posted a few weeks ago that generates ship type and function. Now you can layer on what life is currently like aboard the vessel you roll up.

Feedback welcome! It would be great to hear about any adjustments you think should be made to the table or how it plays out for anyone that uses it.

**Shipboard Situation D66 Table**

*--------------------Crew Dynamic Situations:*

**1.1  The captain is unconscious.**

The next most senior person has taken charge. A social skill check while talking to the ship via comms will reveal more.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The captain has a brain injury and has been put into a cryopod for treatment at the next highport. Weirdly, the ship's engineer is the next most senior and has had to take command.

(3–4) The captain suffered a psychotic break. The crew bound their hands with zip ties and locked them in their cabin.

(5–6) The captain had a severe allergic reaction and is out of action. The crew is secretly happy to have the second-in-command running things.

**1.2  Last paycheck bounced.**

The crew is grumbling, but the captain is dodging questions.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The crew is overworked regularly. Mutiny is highly likely if this happens again.

(3–4) It’s not the first time. All non-bridge crew have handed in their resignations and intend to leave at the next port. They will ask any passing ship if jobs are available.

(5–6) What the crew doesn't know is that the captain has been decommissioned, pending investigation for skimming money for a long time. They’ve just transferred all the crew’s pay into their own account and are planning to do a runner.

**1.3  The ship’s weapons locker has been tampered with.**

No one is owning up.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) A laser handgun is missing.

(3–4) Some demolition charges are missing.

(5–6) The code was changed accidentally, and no one has the skill to hack it open or reset it.

**1.4  The ship’s cook quit.**

Happened just as the ship was departing its last port of call

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The captain is the only one who can cook and is doing double duty, but has never catered for so many. Meals are mostly overcooked protein slabs and gritty soy-rice.

(3–4) The emergency ration crate contains only one flavour: synthetic “spiced meatball” bars. Technically edible, but the crew is already sick of them.

(5–6) The crew set up a rotating cooking roster. People are enjoying this new found variety but recipes are limited. They ask passing ships about favourite foods or recipes, and even exchange bulk meals during brief dockings.

**1.5  Old ship, clearly under-crewed.**

Currently looking for anyone with a ship-relevant skill of 0 or higher.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) Most younger crew got into a drunken brawl during shore leave and are now serving time in the local prison system.

(3–4) The ship has a long-standing “bad luck” reputation. Several bizarre, fatal accidents have wiped out crews in the past. Superstition keeps new recruits away.

(5–6) Owned by a terrible human captain with an awful reputation. Only the most desperate will serve under them.

**1.6  Looking for a skilled astrogator.**

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The ship botched it's last jump, they exited at the wrong location and partially crashed into an asteroid. The astrogator is leaving at the next stop.

(3–4) A junior officer (Skill 0) is currently doing astrogation, having been learning from the main astrogator who was recently incapacitated. The J-drive keeps getting damaged.

(5–6) The astrogator was fired for illicit activities. They urgently need a temporary replacement until the new one arrives in 1D6 days.

**2.1  Off-shift crew tensions.**

Loud shouting some times heard, possibly in the background if talking to the ship via comms.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The ""Night shift"" crew failed to notice a fire in the supplies. Most food was destroyed. Now everyone’s on half rations, and the rest of the crew is furious.

(3–4) The XO and the captain had a serious falling out over a risky ship repair. The crew is divided and suspicious of mutiny.

(5–6) A shipboard romance between a day-shifter and a night-shifter turned sour, splitting the crew into friend groups backing each person.

**2.2  New captain thinks they know it all.**

Old crew are politely trying to prevent major mistakes.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The captain is barely out of their teens. A well-connected relative got them this command.

(3–4) Scored extremely high academically and was supported by a patron. Unfortunately, academic skills does not equal real-world command experience.

(5–6) An older captain that very much looks the part, they also talk in a very experience way. They must have lied about prior experience though because they barley know how a ship works let alone how to run one successfully. It seems they are trying to bluff their way through being in charge.

**2.3  New crew member is not what they seem.**

Now, their real identity has been revealed.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) A corporate spy gathering data for an upcoming trade deal. The captain has them locked in their quarters.

(3–4) A bounty hunter tracking someone onboard. Crew is angry, and the hunter is locked up “for everyone’s protection.”

(5–6) A desperate fugitive wanted by a corporation for breaking a contract. The captain is still deciding what to do.

**2.4  The captain has a family member aboard temporarily.**

\[1D6\]

(1–2) Niece aboard as a training cadet. Currently obsessed with mutinies. Constantly asks crew (and passing ships) about stories of mutiny, have they ever been in one and if not then how they’d hypothetically do one, much to the captains annoyance. The crew seem to be either deeply annoyed or deeply entertained by this.

(3–4) Hi IQ sister aboard as a guest. She has been to talking to someone in a department she is highly trained in, and so has been able to upgrade one of the ships core systems.

She has also told many embarrassing childhood stories about the captain.

(5–6) Young nephew is shadowing Engineering but has developed a crush on a junior tech. The crew is merciless with teasing.

**2.5  Nervous about inspection.**

The crew is busy scrubbing some recent logs before the patrol arrives. They casually ask if they know how far away the closest customs and boarding patrol is.

A social skill check reveals that:

\[1D6\]

(1–2) They unknowingly helped tow a smuggler with fake registry papers into port, bypassing customs.

(3–4) They traded exotic spices for alien coffee with someone later revealed to be a high-ranking syndicate boss. The ""spices"" might be illegal contraband.

(5–6) Their comms operator may have accidentally helped another ship avoid a customs patrol through casual info-sharing and social engineering.

**2.6  Recently ambushed.**

Ship is returning from recent skirmish where they were ambushed. They are now, damaged and twitchy, misidentification of your ship or intentions could be fatal because the entire crew is on a hair trigger.

Anyone with military background can calm them with a standard success roll.

\[1D6\]

(1–2) The ship aims it weapon(s) at you as soon as they have a lock on your position, they do not intend to be fooled again.

(3–4) A short sharp message is sent from the ship demanding you identify your intentions. Their crew is in Vacc suits, weapons powered up and ready for action.

(5–6) They warn you about a hostile ship that is in the area they just came from, saying to avoid it or risk being attacked by the criminals.

**3.1  Crew member suspected dead.**

Occurred after the ship was in serious trouble. \[1D6\]

(1-2) Got spaced during a last-ditch attempt to put out a fire. An emergency vac suit pouch on their belt deployed, though, and they have stowed away back on board the ship, perhaps hiding briefly until they can exact revenge for trying to ""murder"" them. Some kind of psychological break or head trauma may have occurred.

A successful sensor scan of this ship may detect an improvised explosive device or other similar sabotage in place.

(3-4) Someone got sucked out of the side of the ship during a hull breach. The crew is holding a memorial aboard the ship for the lost crewmember. They’re broadcasting an open comm to nearby ships, inviting others to join a final viewing of their favourite film, Space Vikings. Contributions of food or drink are welcome, but not expected.

(5-6) The captain needs to deliver a crate of the late crewmember’s belongings one jump away to a family member who will meet them there. The ship has to jump in the opposite direction and is offering a reward of 1K credits to any ship that can deliver the crate of belongings for them.

Anyone with a Diplomacy skill will be able to tell that doing this delivery for free will have a profound effect on the gratitude of the captain and crew. An ally might be gained, or a favour at the very least.

**3.2  Planetary debt collectors are about to enter range.**

They have started chasing this ship. A loan shark is pinging them on open channels with threatening messages. The crew is starting to worry.

A successful Streetwise check while talking to the ship over comms will reveal what the story is.

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The captain is deep in debt and has been covertly fleeing them for several weeks now. Unfortunately, the loan sharks have finally caught up and are starting to issue some entirely legal (by local law at least) threats if the ship is not stopped and the captain turned over to them.

(3-4) A crew member has a gambling problem. They bet everything and lost, then borrowed money to try and win it all back, only to lose again. The crew member’s recent physical injuries were not just from an accident after all, it seems.

(5-6) The loan sharks are actually part of a crime syndicate that tricked the captain into some kind of electronic agreement. Now they are after their monthly hidden fee of shake-down money. The captain is not interested in being a victim and will do whatever it takes to avoid or dissuade them, including asking passing ships to run interference if needed.

**3.3  The ship is carrying quarantined passengers.**

Red lights flashing brightly on its hull to display the interplanetary signal of a full quarantine.

All the crew are currently in vac suits.

\[1D6\]

(1-2) All of the crew are currently unconscious from an off-world viral outbreak. The ship is on autopilot and the ship’s computer is monitoring their vitals while asking likely ships for help.

(3-4) The ship picked up survivors from a moon colony that has all but been wiped out by an outbreak of an alien virus.

They are transporting them to the closest capable medical facility.

(5-6) The crew have intentionally quarantined themselves after getting infected and sick from some kind of alien fungus that started growing in the ship’s walls. Any high-grade medical equipment or skills would be greatly appreciated by them right now.

**3.4  Captain and a crew member in heated conflict.**

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The captain and a junior officer have been having a 'secret' relationship. Once discovered, this is the kind of thing that can often end careers. It’s seen as a possible abuse of power by one of the crew. They have refused to serve under the captain and are leading some other crew to do the same. Other members of the crew, those that have been aboard the longest, are defending the captain.

Either way, the tension on board is super high right now.

(3-4) A big argument erupted between the head of repairs/engineering and the captain about an upcoming repair job. The engineer is highly experienced and has done this kind of thing many times, saying the captain’s way is wrong and possibly dangerous, but the captain won’t back down and wants it done their way.

Anyone operating sensors will see what the repair job on this ship is, and anyone with Engineering or Mechanical skills can see the captain is wrong.

(5-6) An older and highly skilled crew member has been harassing the other staff for a long time now, recently bringing the newest crew member to screaming tears. The captain has had enough, and a huge shouting match could be heard in the captain’s cabin when the old hand was brought in to be reprimanded. The ship procedures are nowhere near as smooth as they normally are now that the old hand has given up caring about their job.

**3.5  A crew member recently went crazy.**

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The ship's captain and senior staff have been acting corrupt. A former military crew member has had enough. After clearing out the weapons locker, they attempted a lone mutiny to take over the ship. It’s been a tense standoff for several days now as the rest of the crew either hides in fear, cheers them on, or just feels trapped in the middle and tries to stay out of danger.

(3-4) Through some bad decision-making, the captain got a crew member killed. Their sibling, also on board, sought justice for their fallen family member and killed the captain and several who defended them. They’ve taken control of the bridge, destroyed comms, and put the ship on autopilot.

The crew is just waiting for the ship to get to port so security can handle it.

(5-6) A crew member has locked themselves in the ship’s cargo hold with all the food rations, a barrel of water, and a gun. They’ve welded and barricaded themselves in and won’t come out until the ship is docked. They don’t trust any crew member who could be “in on it” and refuse to elaborate. The ship has continued on its original course.

A successful Social check will reveal that the crew member thinks that one or more of the crew is not human, but merely pretending to be.

*--------------------Ship Damage Situations:*

**3.6  The ship is leaking radiation.**

A quick active sensor scan (Easy Sensors check) reveals a containment breach in the power plant.

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The crew are all in vac suits and are just trying to reach the nearest port for repairs. They have sealed off affected compartments and are managing minimal power to avoid stressing the system.

(3-4) Recent hull damage has caused expanding cracks in the power plant’s shielding. The crew is frantically welding on reinforcement plates to contain the heat and radiation until they can dock.

(5-6) The power plant is entering the early stages of meltdown. The engineer has delayed the worst by venting coolant heated to an extreme degree into space, but they will need help either to perform an emergency shutdown (assisting in a Very Hard Engineering check) or to help evacuate. Time is short.

**4.1  The ship has a bad batch of coolant.**

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The medical freezer has stopped working properly, meaning some advanced drugs are no longer functional.

A Luck roll or similar will need to be made in future medical emergencies to see if things like antivenom have gone bad or not .

(3-4) The ship’s refrigeration room has stopped working and as a result, all the fresh food has gone off. Canned and packet foods are all that’s left. Any Aslan crew member(s) have become highly agitated due to dietary needs. Tensions are rising, and they are pressuring the captain to trade or hunt for fresh meat.

(5-6) The ship’s internal temperature has slowly been rising all week due to body heat being trapped inside. Now it’s downright tropical inside. Moisture condenses on every surface, mildew is forming, and tempers are short. The crew is stripped down to stay cool, but everyone’s irritable and exhausted.

**4.2  Jury-rigged systems everywhere**

Welded plates, taped consoles, exposed wires. This ship is barely holding together.

\[1D6\]

(1-2) Serious ship damage caused an onboard fire in the engineering area, which destroyed most of the tools and a lot of repair gear. The ship’s main engineer has done the best they can until they can get fully resupplied again.

(3-4) They were hit by an interstellar dust cloud upon jumping into the system. the ship took a lot of damage from the micrometeorites that punched through the hull while they were inside the cloud.

1D6 -3 crew members were also hit and are recovering from their wounds. The ship’s stores of replacement parts were quickly exhausted, they have just patched things up as best they can for now.

(5-6) Extended operations have meant the ship has not had the time for the overhaul it needs. It just keeps going from job to job so really needs a good, long refit in a station drydock. The crew has done the best they can to keep patching things up, but the temporary repairs that were meant to last days have turned into months.

**4.3  Cracked Fuel Tanks**

\[1D6\]

(1-2) Taking damage from a bad landing in a storm, the ship developed hairline fractures through the main fuel tank, which all ruptured when the ship exited jump space. Many interior sections are now flooded with literal tonnes of fuel.

(3-4) The ship ran into a fast-travelling piece of space debris. It ruptured the internal fuel tank and pierced the hull. Fuel is rapidly leaking out around the ship. Crew both inside and outside are working on repairs, but it’s difficult work with the tank filled.

(5-6) The high-pressure pump built into the fuel tank had a catastrophic malfunction and began spilling fuel into the ship at hundreds of litres per second. The high-pressure failure caused the captain to order all the fuel dumped into open space. They're now on backup power with no fuel for the main power plant. Changing course with the engines is not really an option right now.

**4.4  A Malfunctioning Food Dispensing.**

The machine is starting to cause problems for the crew.

(1-2) One of the crew bought an aftermarket “Apex” culinary AI software package (from a very legal street vendor in the back alley of a star town) to upgrade the ship’s meal options with dishes from many worlds and cultures. Now the food dispenser only obeys requests with exact syntax, misinterprets orders, and responds with passive-aggressive or outright hostile remarks on its interface display. The captain is casually asking around if anyone has the original software package. Maybe in exchange for a small favour.

(3-4) The auto-cooker is stuck in some kind of program loop. No matter what meal is selected, it now only prints the same protein-rich algae slab it calls a “survival ration.” The crew are losing their minds.

(5-6) The corporation that owns this machine has been sending technicians to replace old units with a new version. The only problem is it requires direct payment to the company for each meal. Crew morale is dropping as nutrition is held hostage by corporate upselling. A few crew are obsessed with the built-in voucher system, for one extra credit you get a chance to win an “Unlock Pass” for special fine dining meal options.

A chat with the captain and a successful Streetwise check will reveal they’re trying to find a way for the new machine to have an unrecoverable accident.

**4.5 A crew member has smuggled a pet onboard.**

If contacted, the ship immediately asks if anyone has any animal handling skills. The creature’s newfound freedom has resulted in some... problems.

\[1D6\]

(1-2) It has gotten into the air vents (somehow they always end up in the vents) and can be heard making annoying scurrying and banging noises day and night. Worse, it chews on toiletries. Morale is starting to plummet.

(3-4) The creature found its way to an electrical junction in a crawlspace inside a bulkhead and chewed through a bunch of important control wires. One of the ship’s systems (lighting, smoke detectors, internal airlock doors, etc.) now triggers on and off intermittently. It’ll take at least a day to rectify, and in the meantime, it may be chewing on something else.

(5-6) Unknown to the crew member, the creature was pregnant. It nested and gave birth in the ship’s hollow spaces. Bio-contamination from the brood has made it into the water system. The crew is dehydrated and irritable (energy drinks being the only real hydration option) and are desperately rigging filtration workarounds while chasing scattered offspring through the vents.

**4.6  The ship’s computer was recently hacked.**

It occurred while evading a highly suspicious vessel. As a result of the hack:

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The doors to everyone’s bedrooms have been locked and deadbolted. They are now unresponsive. For a small fee of 1D6 K credits, sent to an anonymous account, the doors will unlock. The captain really doesn’t want to cut that many holes in the ship’s walls or fully disassemble the doors and automated frames they are built into. They need someone with strong Computer skills (Hard check) and would rather pay them to get rid of the hacked software.

(3-4) The doors are rewired to crush people, asks them how they know. Now all have been wedged or welded open. This has caused no small amount of annoyance due to a complete lack of privacy. They will pay 1D6 K credits to someone who can restore the programming (hard Computer check).

(5-6) The ship’s CPU has been infected with a well-constructed program that rebuilds itself when deleted and infests the ship’s computer with an AI personality that is as sarcastic as it is pessimistic. It makes low-level threats about killing crew members but never follows through. Unhidden in the code is a data address for fans to donate money or buy coffee for the software's developer.

**5.1  Basic equipment failure.**

(1-2) The water recycler is broken. The crew is on water rations until they reach port. No one has washed or done laundry, and everyone is slightly dehydrated.

(3-4) Worn-out grav plates are causing partial gravity fluctuations aboard the ship. Crew stumble, tools float, and hair occasionally floats upward. They’re missing the specialized parts needed for repairs.

(5-6) Trash disposal has all but exploded. It keeps triggering full ship power reboots. The captain keeps promising a new system, but that hasn’t happened. Waste bags pile up in an unused supply closet. The ship smells like a landfill. Air filters are on max, making the ship sound like a wind tunnel.

**5.2  Crew member has had multiple people they worked with die.**

(1-2) A relatively new crew member has seen both their EVA partners die in accidents. Now, no one wants to spacewalk with them. A third EVA is needed, but no one is willing. A successful Interrogation check reveals they’re a literal psychopath who caused the accidents. If fired, they’ll just find another ship to repeat it on.

(3-4) The ship was recently on a one-off contract job for a mega-corporation. A safety failure caused mass casualties. One crew member survived.. suspiciously. An Investigation check or a good Intelligence-world contact reveals the survivor is an undercover agent for a rival corporation, sent to sabotage the mission at any cost.

(5-6) A few months ago, a catastrophic event killed 2D6 crew. The lone survivor now drinks heavily, on and off duty. The captain and old crew turn a blind eye, but recently hired replacements are fed up. Tensions onboard are high.

**5.3  The ship is mistaken for a dishonoured vessel.**

(1-2) An Aslan ship catches up to them and demands, “You must prove your innocence, or fight a champion.” They believe this ship disrespected the captain’s clan. Real or imagined, this claim must be addressed or the Aslan ship will become hostile.

(3-4) The IFF signature of this ship is identical to one that committed a terrible crime in a nearby system. A passing ship contacts them, claiming to have witnessed the event and threatens to report them to security. Either this ship committed the crime, or more likely, its IFF code was copied by a criminal ship of the same type.

(5-6) This ship was recorded passing a recent shipwreck with survivors signalling for help. There may be legitimate reasons (crew asleep on autopilot, in cryo, or systems being repaired) but it’s highly likely the crew deemed the wreck too far and too much of a delay to help.

**5.4  Unpopular in this system.**

(1-2) Due to past misconduct, the ship receives a message from the local port: they are now denied access to TAS facilities.

(3-4) A message from local security demands they depart immediately or face impoundment for serious ""safety violations.""

(5-6) An attempt to bribe traffic control to avoid customs has failed. The ship is now hastily preparing to jump out of the system.

**5.5  Just got back from responding to a distress call they received.**

(1-2) The entire crew heard it. They set an intercept course, but when they got there, there was nothing to rescue. Everyone is a bit freaked out by this.. no one can explain it.

(3-4) A nearby ship had run out of fuel and was asking to buy some from anyone with extra. This ship responded and either gave them some or sold it for a hefty profit to help get them underway again. In exchange, they were also given some homemade baked goods.

(5-6) They responded to a ship that had mis-jumped, and its drive was critical. Unfortunately, as they got closer and tried to help, the ship suffered a cascade of failures and exploded, becoming a flaming wreck of plasma fires and twisted metal. This ship’s sensors are being worked on after taking damage from the explosion.

**5.6  Fuel miscalculation.**

They don't have enough fuel to reach their destination. They’re stalling the people they were supposed to meet. Any ship that can lend them some fuel would be great.

(1-2) The captain is lying, they have plenty of fuel. They just enjoy getting free fuel from suckers.

(3-4) The fuel was miscalculated by the navigator. They’re taking a huge amount of flak for it and are looking to jump ship at the next possible opportunity even if that means just getting a ride from someone else.

(5-6) The captain will pay 10 times the normal fuel price for a top-up. The people they’re supposed to meet cannot be kept waiting under any circumstances, failing to show could easily be a career ender.

**6.1  They are towing another ship behind them.**

(1-2) They claim it’s a lawful salvage they found and have laid claim to.

(3-4) They received a distress call from the ship, which ran out of fuel. They are towing it to a refuelling station.

(5-6) The ship was taken over by criminal passengers or pirates. The towed vessel is actually where they’ve stashed the tied-up original crew. They could cut them loose at any moment to get away. Or, if they're particularly cruel, they might just launch the towed ship into the local star to eliminate anyone who could identify them.

**6.2  The ship is carrying a person on a wanted list. And they know it.**

(1-2) The captain is helping a family member out by giving them last-minute transport for a “holiday” in another system. In reality, the family member is evading arrest from the local government. A Legal skill check will reveal the person is flagged and should be reported if seen.

(3-4) A recent system-wide broadcast is calling for a crew member of this ship to surrender to local authorities. The captain is unsure what to do. The rest of the crew likes the person too much to rat them out or hand them over. Until they decide, the ship is ignoring all incoming hails.

(5-6) The ship responded to a short-range emergency beacon on the edge of the system, then picked up someone from a damaged small craft. The person asked for a lift to the next system. It soon becomes apparent that this person is actually a fugitive. A successful Social roll while talking to the crew will reveal what’s really going on.

**6.3  Not everything is as it seems.**

\[1D6\]

(1-2) The ship is legit enough, but the original crew has all been replaced by pirates. The real crew is being held hostage in a hidden vault room built into an asteroid on the system's edge. The pirates plan to use the ship as cover during a hit. A successful Streetwise check will give away what’s really happening.

(3-4) The ship is using a fake IFF transponder. A visual inspection shows they’re not who they say they are, it’s actually a covert ops team prepping to raid a nearby moon base. Interfering could be dangerous. Reporting them might earn you a powerful enemy.

A military background and an Easy success roll might let you help in a small way, perhaps by distracting the base.

(5-6) The captain is smuggling for a crime syndicate and receives secret payments for the job. Don't look in the containers. No questions asked and the money is theirs. 1D6 crew members are in on it too.

**6.4  Secret Codes.**

These encrypted IFF codes that marks a ship as exempt from inspections (customs/warships). It changes monthly.

(1-2) The comms officer is alone on the bridge and is contacting nearby vessels to see if they want to buy a copy.

(3-4) The comms officer is considering turning in the captain after discovering the code has been used secretly for months.

(5-6) The captain calls to warn that something criminal is up with a nearby ship, it just tried to sell them one of these IFF codes.

**6.5  The crew is running a side hustle.**

(1-2) 1D6 crew members were sightseeing on an uninhabited world when they came across an alien artefact, the kind that's very illegal to try and sell. They’ve kept it secret while trying to find a buyer in various star towns. A Very Hard Sensors check will reveal the artefact is on board.

(3-4) One crew member is doing speculative trading, buying and selling various types of contraband through black market contacts in several systems. No one else on board knows what they're up to. A Very Hard Streetwise check will show they’re looking to offload something shady.

(5-6) Occasionally, the ship has some leftover room that can be filled with a moderate-sized cargo container.. the kind that can be retrofitted to carry 1D6 unregistered passengers who need to travel between systems without going through those annoying legal channels.

*--------------------Something Mysterious:*

**6.6  Intact but no life signs.**

The ship is unresponsive to all hails and on a single, unchanging course like some kind of floating derelict. A successful sensor check reveals the atmosphere to be intact and full life support running, but no life signs on board.

(1-2) All the ships escape pods are missing, whatever caused everyone to get in them and abandon ship is unknown, as is the crews current location but their probable location could be tracked down by accessing the ships computer.

(3-4) A mis-jump has caused the crew and all other biological matter inside to not exit jump space with the ship. If they have entered normal space again at all is unknown.

(5-6) Unexplainable. All on board recording devices just work perfectly up until a point several days ago where they just started recording backgrounds static as if the ship wasn't even there and then they all turned off.",8,1750324669.0,traveller,2,1.0,False

(https://www.reddit.com/r/phhorrorstories/s/Dhyvi8kADa)

But since I am on a break, tedium and dullness descends lol, I will share my daughter’s experience. 

She’s psychic, a tarot reader, and is one of the protégés of a famous paranormal community pillar in the Ph. 

But prior to her being this spiritually strong young woman, she was a clueless and oblivious pre-teen back then. 

She was a new student, silent, keeps to herself. Only speaks when spoken to. 

She was eating alone during lunch when one student sat beside her. The girl was energetic, happy, and giddy the total opposite of my daughter. But that first meeting was the first of many and they developed a friendship. 

My daughter just knew that she had a good friend in Epi. Whenever they get the chance to see each other, they spent it chit-chatting and sharing stories. 

December came and our daughter asked if she can bring Epi (Short for Epifania) home after the Christmas party. She won’t be staying overnight, so of course we were happy to oblige. 

That nice and sunny Saturday came. 
Me and my husband were having our siesta coffee. 

My daughter came in and introduced Epi. 
My husband asked if they have eaten lunch, daughter replied that they were still full with the party food they ate. 

They excused themselves, giggling while talking about some boy. 

My husband stared at me, waiting for my confirmation. I just nodded. We both sipped our coffee in silence. 

Evening came and Epi was about to go home. She does not want to stay for dinner. 

I offered to drive her to her home but she refused. My husband talked to our daughter to distract her. After a few minutes, Epi relents and accepted the offer. 

I went home, kinda tired, but on a high. 
Soaked myself in our tub with an epsom salt bath. 

Epi is at peace and will be at peace for eternity. ",3,1750324420.0,phhorrorstories,2,1.0,False

1lf65we,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHorrorCollection/comments/1lf65we/my_wifes_game_turned_into_a_nightmare_horror/,My Wife’s “Game” Turned Into a Nightmare [Horror],"Imagine thinking you know someone—your wife, your rock, the person you’ve loved for eight years—only to see them transform into something… else. That’s the chilling core of my latest horror story, \*My Wife Likes to Play with Me\*. Mark and Sarah are the picture of normal: no drama, no red flags. He’s a horror nerd; she’s the opposite, rolling her eyes at scary movies. But two months ago, something snapped. Sarah started playing a “game” that’s anything but fun.



It began innocently enough. Mark’s rushing to work, gulping coffee, when he catches Sarah peeking from behind a door—eyes wide, unblinking, staring like she’s not quite human. She darts away, giggling a laugh that’s too high, too wrong. He shrugs it off—maybe she’s pranking him for once. But it doesn’t stop. Night after night, she’s lurking—behind the couch, under the kitchen island, even in the attic hatch—grinning like a deranged predator. Each time, Mark yells, demands answers. She just giggles and vanishes, leaving him questioning his sanity.



Things escalate fast. One night, Mark’s showering, steam thick, when Sarah’s head stretches past the curtain—eyes blood-red, mascara streaking like veins, mouth drooling in a grotesque grin. “Peekaboo, Marky!” she rasps, voice unrecognizable. She shouldn’t be home. He bolts, locks himself in, but she’s everywhere—watching, hunting. The final straw? Finding her under their bed, surrounded by gutted birds, shrieking, “Fun, FUN!” as she slashes him with glass. Mark flees, but Sarah’s relentless, tracking him to motels, smearing bloody grins on windows, whispering “peekaboo” through locked doors.



What makes this story terrifying is its intimacy. This isn’t a ghost or a monster—it’s Mark’s \*wife\*, the person he trusts most, turning into a feral nightmare. The psychological dread of doubting your reality, mixed with visceral horror—her crawling, giggling, slashing—keeps you on edge. Is she possessed? Insane? Or something worse? Her mother’s cryptic warning, “She’s not Sarah anymore,” only deepens the mystery.



If you love horror that burrows under your skin, blending domestic fear with supernatural chills, this one’s for you. Ever had a loved one act so out of character it scared you? Or felt watched in your own home? Share your creepy experiences below—I’m all ears for your real-life chills!

But she’s gotten on her meds again and from what I’ve heard from people that we mutually know about it they all think that she’s doing really good right now and she misses me and feels bad but doesn’t know how she could even repair things due to how it ended. So what I’m wondering is given all the information I’ve given y’all do I try to reach out  trying to get back together cuz Ik we both want it to some degree or should I protect my feelings and leave it  because it would never be the same after what happened and the abuse side of things  or do I try to find a happy medium and try to be friends with her even if it kills me a little… or should I just move on like I’ve was trying before I saw her again .

I don't remember the title of the song nor who made it.
It's a Korean song, but the guy doesn't really sing per se? He's sort of speaking rhythmically alongside the beat, but it's not like rapping. I don't really know genres of music well and I've never heard a song like this one ever again, so I don't know how to describe it or what it could be called... I don't really remember the rhythm exactly but it was kinda simple and slow enough that he was talking clearly. He sounds kinda depressed in a sort of nonchalant ""fuck my stupid baka life"" kind of tone? But I don't really know Korean too well so I don't know if that is really what the song was about...
Lyric wise, I don't really remember the exact words but I think there was a part of the song where he sung about like a cafe he was sitting in? Something about the coffee being like water, the table being sticky? And a roach crawling by? There's also a part I think where he made note of it raining?
Every time I try to look up anything relating to these, it's not the right song... I really want to listen to it again, please help me, thank you 🙏",1,1750322677.0,findthatsong,0,0.99,False

I think it’s working","Okay so here’s the situation. I (18M) have been best friends with this girl, Sami (18F), since like 7th grade. She’s basically like a sister to me. We hang out all the time, talk about everything, and there’s never been anything romantic between us (people used to assume though, which was annoying).

Anyway, Sami has this friend, Mia (also 18F), who I used to barely know. We’ve all been in the same school, but Mia and I never really talked until senior year. She started showing up more when Sam invited me to hang out. At first it was just the three of us going for coffee or watching movies at Sam’s place.

So Galee and I started having this weird banter. Like she’d roast me for how I dress or make fun of my music taste, and I’d tease her back. But it never felt mean. And sometimes I’d catch her smiling after she said something mean. Like she wanted me to say something back.

Then there’s the little stuff. Like she always finds a way to sit next to me, she texts me random memes and reels, or asks if I’ve seen this show and then says “we should watch it” like it’s casual.

I told Sami jokingly one day like, Yo, your friend lowkey bullies me for fun, and Sami just smiled and said, Yeah… she does that when she likes someone.

????  I SERIOUSLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO REACT.... 

I tried to play it cool, but now I’m noticing everything. Like Galee laughed way too hard at a joke I made that wasn’t even that funny. And then I started doing dumb stuff like fixing my hair before I see her or choosing better hoodies.

Then the wildest thing happened. Sami and Ken (our other friend who barely shows up since he's in different schol now) had to leave early during one of our movie/ catching up nights and left me and Mia alone. We awkwardly watched like 20 more minutes of the movie, then just started talking. It was actually really nice. No teasing, just kind of… soft. I don’t know how to explain it.

Now I’m sitting here, wondering if I should tell Mia I like her or at least admit that something is going on between us (or just me?). But I’m also afraid I imagined the whole thing. Like maybe she’s just like that with everyone? Or maybe Sami's messing with me??

Anyway yeah, that’s my current situation. Me lowkey crushing on my best friend’s friend who might also be crushing back, while my best friend probably knows and is playing Cupid.

My best friend might be trying to set me up with her friend, and I think it’s working because now I’m catching feelings. Not sure if I’m imagining it or if this is actually happening. Im cooked

1lf5rbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lf5rbq/john/,John,"“What the fuck,” John whispers.

His eyes snap open. The ceiling above him is cracked and grey, stained with the weight of time. His mouth is dry, his body stiff. Sleep offered no rest just more of the same static silence that follows him day after day.

He gets up. Cold floor under bare feet. The fan creaks slowly overhead like a broken metronome. The clock on his desk reads 11:03 a.m., though he doesn’t remember going to bed.

He brushes his teeth. Washes his face. Makes instant coffee. His reflection in the mirror lags a second too long before copying his movements.

He walks out of his room.

Silence.

No sizzling from the kitchen. No clatter of keys. No rustling newspapers. No parents.

The house feels… emptied. Not like they left. Like they were erased.

He calls his mom.
Ring-ring-ring… cut.
Calls again.
Same thing.

He tries his dad.
Ring-ring-cut.

No answer. No callbacks.

Something inside him tightens.

John walks to the balcony.

Stillness.

The city below should be alive cars, voices, stray dogs barking. But now?

Nothing.

Not a single sound.

He tries calling friends. Contacts. Anyone.

Ring-cut. Ring-cut. Ring-cut. Ring-cut. Ring-cut. Ring-cut. Ring-cut.

His fingers are shaking.

“What the fuck is going on?” he mutters. Louder this time.

He paces. Tries the TV—static. The internet—dead. Yet the lights are on. The fridge hums. The clock ticks.

The world is still functioning.

Just without anyone in it.

A thought creeps into his head: maybe this is what he wanted. He’s always hated people. Their noise. Their judgment. Their presence.

Maybe this is peace.

But the silence is too heavy. It’s not calm it’s suffocating.

Time begins to slide. Minutes stretch. Hours vanish. It’s like reality is struggling to keep its grip.

The sun sets too fast.

It’s midnight.

But it shouldn’t be.

John stares at the clock as it jumps ahead by the second. 12:01… 12:04… 12:09..

Something is wrong.

Deeply wrong.

Then the lights go out.

A hollow click. The fridge stops. The fan dies. The silence becomes total. Final.

John looks outside.

The city is gone.

No distant windows glowing. No moon. No stars. Just black.

He flicks on his phone’s flashlight. A narrow beam pierces forward but it hits nothing. Just more black. It’s like light itself is being swallowed.

He backs away, pulse racing. Sweat cold on his neck.

Then he hears it.

A breath.

Not his.

Somewhere near—or maybe inside—the apartment. A slow, damp inhale. Then silence again.

“Why?” he whispers.

But there’s no answer.

There never is.

He walks to the door, because that’s all that’s left. His hand trembles on the knob. He opens it.

And nearly falls.

There’s no hallway. No neighbors. No walls. Just the front of his apartment, hanging over an abyss that stretches into forever.

No sound.

No color.

No bottom.

He steps back.

Everything feels thinner now—like the walls aren’t real, like the floor might give out next.

And then

He wakes up.

Same ceiling. Same bed. Same clock blinking 11:03 a.m.

Same silence.

“What the fuck,” John whispers again

1lf5qsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lf5qsi/my_grad_school_crush_confided_in_me_all_night/,My grad school crush confided in me all night… then said he likes someone at our table,"I think I’m in love (or limerence) with my guy friend, we’re both in grad school. He’s genuinely the nicest man I’ve ever met. He helped me tour apartments, sign the lease, moved me in with his car, and even walked me home my first night, even though his place was way closer.

He stares at me a lot when we’re in groups, cuts my food (I offered him a bite of my pork, and he just cut it up for me without asking then took a piece), gives me snacks, and when his friends hype him up for his body, he flexes and looks at me as if asking “do you want to see?”. he’s invited me for coffee once, dinner another (when no one was around), and he’s glad we became closer. he’s always helping me and we have a good friendship. 

A few nights ago, he opened up about his estranged father’s death. I didn’t ask, he just started telling me the things he’s dealt with in the past year. He was drunk, and he said only very few people know, and that he wants to be able to talk to me more. He’s even working really hard on his English for that.

Then last night, he brought it up again while drunk too. We talked almost all night, barely interacting with our other friends at the table. But he also mentioned he likes someone… a friend, and then pointed at our table that had 20ish people. Said he’s scared of ruining the friendship if they dated and broke up. He didn’t say who. I think it’s either me or another close girl friend of his (we’re the only two single girls he’s close to in the group).

There’s also this other girl (H) who’s super flirtatious with him. She has a boyfriend but keeps joking about cheating or leaving her boyfriend (then she says how she’s just joking and she loves him). we went shopping yesterday and she kept touching my friend when he was trying on clothes, and told him not to get a certain shirt because it shows off his muscles too much. 

But they’re not actually close friends — more just playful coworkers. so i don’t know if she’s the girl he was referring to that he likes, because their friendship is not close enough to be scared of ruining, i think. He didn’t even want to tell her they were going shopping, but he gave in after she begged and kept asking where he was going. then he invited both of us. 

Anyway, when she’s around, I feel invisible. the whole convo and setting orbits around her and he smiles and looks at her a lot as he’s passing by when i’m with her. i don’t bother competing for attention because im not that i kind of person. ",1,1750322238.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I currently have a Sage/Breville Barista Express (BES875) which I bought back in 2015. I've never had a problem with the coffee it's produced, and it had been trouble-free until about 18 months ago when the PCB failed. Unfortunately the replacement then failed 9 months ago, and the replacement for that has just failed, so I'm wondering if it's a better idea to replace the machine than replace the PCB again (assuming the retailer won't replace the PCB).

I'm looking for recommendations for a new machine and grinder, and have the following requirements:

* Ideally a similar level of automation to the Sage in terms of water temperature and shot dispensing
* More durable than the Sage
* Reasonable spare parts availability, and ideally home-serviceable
* Whilst I'll be using filtered water, I live in a hard water area - my kettle shows an even \~0.25mm layer of limescale 7 days after descaling
* Space isn't overly-abundant, so I'm looking for something approximately the same size as the Sage (about 35cm cube), or not too much bigger
* Suitable for my expected usage is 1 set of 3 lattes per day

I'm in the UK, and my budget is £1750 (although I'd ideally like to keep it under £1500). Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to see/try any machines prior to purchase - the nearest retailer is a John Lewis an hour away which only stocks Sage, DeLonghi, and Jura.

I did a quick search, which suggested looking at a Lelit Elizabeth or Ascaso Steel DUO PID with a grinder like Lelit Fred Tempo or Eureka Mignon Specialita/Silenzio, but I'm not sure whether those are sensible suggestions or not (the Sage is my first-and-only espresso machine, so I'm not sure if these are too much of a step up).

Thanks for any help/advice :)",1,1750321665.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1lf5k91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lf5k91/just_try_it/,Just try it.,"Wanted to share something that helped me tremendously, especially in the beginning. 

I initially gave myself a month to try this out. Any time I wanted a drink, or just after a long day, I made a vow to myself that instead of alcohol, I would replace it with something else. I chose coffee and I loaded up on the most delicious flavored coffee (decaf and regular), bought an espresso machine, and dove in. I had a coffee tumbler with me at all times.

After that month was over, I knew I wanted to continue my sober journey because of how much better I felt (among other reasons), so I carried on. Of course, there were a couple days my brain was DESPERATELY trying to convince me to switch to wine, but again I shut it down by making a tumbler of coffee and it satisfied the old hag in my brain.

I'm now almost a year into my journey (for the second time in my life) and the little voice actually screams for coffee *INSTEAD* of wine. It's almost like when I trained my dog to sit by giving him 1,000 treats at a time. Long days, events, social gatherings, all I can do is think about what flavored coffee I will bring with me. And double bonus, since I have a drink already, people rarely ask what I want to drink.

I realized that so much of my habit was just that -- habitual. I just needed to train my brain to focus on a less harmful one that doesn't suck the life out of me.

Not sure how helpful this is, and not sure it would work for everyone, but maybe just try it? It can't hurt, can it? Have a great day, sober peeps! 😊",11,1750321492.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

So 2 years ago I found out that my boyfriend M 35 and his co-worker F (married at that time) are texting a lot. . Some of the texts were them flirting, they spent all day at work together. But that seems to be not enough, they write each other almost all the time during office hours but also started writing on the weekends, in the evening. While he went to the mountains with his friends, he sent her same pictures he sent to me (not selfies or anything like that) but pics of all of the guys and him there, video from the pub of them singing, pic of dogs in the pub..Innocent things right..But why the need? Why send the same things he sent to me at 11 pm to just a co-worker at the same time? But they were texting about badminton - because they go together during lung break quite a lot and she said that next time she will train with him and he replied, what will we train? and she replied badminton what he meant by that and he said that you can train a lot of things, but that he also meant badminton...This he explained to me, that that was too much and he realized that, but couldn't tell me why he did it, I asked if it was alcohol, why the need. I feel so betrayed that he is texting me and at the same time he is texting his colleague, sending her the same pics..

He also started to call her name in a diminutive form (don't know if that is a correct way to say that). She asked him to join her on a work trip and he said I will go anywhere with you.

I confronted him about all of this, said that this is too much for me, this is flirting and I am not okay with that, I asked him how would he feel if I texted with my coworker like that, if I wrote him while I was away drinking, after office hours.

I told him that I want him to limit the contact with her to only work-related..

He said he loves me, he didn't mean anything by that, he would never act on that, it stops there for him, that he will change the tone, now that he knows that I am not okay with that, he won't engage that.

This was almost 2 years ago.

Well, same situation repeated a few times..I read their conversations and found something everytime..I know it´s bad to look, I feel bad for going through his phone, but my trust was broken...

And at first he tried to limit the messages, but fell right back into it...

In January, I discovered that she was divorcing her husband. Didn´t know what to think of that.

I also read one of their conversations when they were discussing their seating plan. Now they are sitting across from each other and when we were on vacation, she wrote to him that she misses him, that she has no one to kick under the table with her legs. And now they were messaging if it was better for him to sit next to her or stay across from her so he could have contact under the table, to which she replied that she liked both options, but that if he sat next to her she wouldn't have to keep getting up, when she wanted to express everything to him only with one look.

Then they were discussing her vacation this year, that she has lot of vacation days and will be using them (guess it´s needed and good for her because of the divorce) and he wrote that he won´t let her go and then that he will want reports from her - to stay in touch.

Well I read all of this and confronted him again..it´s tiring because it keeps repeating..I honestly don´t know what to do, because he told me it´s just flirting and it means nothing to him and the reason he flirts is because it´s for fun and that he has been doing it for years and it´s hard to stop.

Also he usually doesn´t tell me anything about this colleague, he for example had a day off and just went to work to stop by for a coffee to see her (not her specifically he said, she was there with another coworker) and he did not say this to me. He avoids telling me anything related to her, because I guess he is afraid of my reaction, I called her names, eventhough I don´t even know her personally, but he just made me not like her..In summer he also didn´t tell me he was leaving for a weekend for a run race they both (and more people from work) signed up for and he told me the evening before, eventhough we had plans and were supposed to go to see his parents and he promised to help mine...so many other examples

I told him that what I hate about this it that I told him more than once that this is uncomfortable for me, that it hurts me and I think it´s disrespectful and that I don´t like it and he promised he will stop now he knows I don´t like it. But I heard this before..and it keeps happening..

He tells me he loves me, that he doesn´t have feelings for her, that it´s just stupid flirting that would never lead to anything more. I asked him how would he feel if I was doing same things and he said he wouldn´t mind, which I find a bit too hard to believe. I don´t know what to do, because my trust is broken and I love him, but he keeps disappointing me and it´s tiring...He keeps repeating that it means nothing to him, and I keep repeating to him that I don´t like it and that he should respect that..

Now last month, I discovered something again...this time it was different, because he hid the messages from me, they were archived.. I saw that when he was on a trip with his friends during the weekend, he was texting with her at 2 am in the morning, she sent him a selfie, which he marked with heart hands emoji. She was in different country for a football match with other people, to which I found out, he was the one taking care of booking their tickets to the match (not paying, but making the effort). During the weekend, he constantly made effort to write to her, asking about the match, exchanging pictures, then he proceeded to send her videos with them singing (just the sound, he didn´t tell his friends he was filming, so it was just take on his feet and the sound of them singing) - three pointless videos at 2 am, none of these he sent to me. To this he told me he hid this because he was ashamed..well I´d be too if I were him, if I was told many times by my fiancee that this hurts him...Well that isn´t everything. I went to a fight with him, told him we are over and that I didn´t want to be together anymore. We were both crying a lot, I let him go away on the weekend to his parents. But then I also found out about another lie. In December after their company christmas party, he went to a lunch and he claimed to me he was there with more people, because they needed to discuss some gossips. Well...he was there only with her. Because in the hidden messages, there was also a group chat to which she sent photo of him across the table in the pub. So I confronted him about that and he was cornered and lied, he told me there were other colleagues too, but the pub was full so they sat at other tables...well BS, I felt like a complete idiot, because from the picture it was obvious, it was just them there..he finally admitted that..He didn´t tell me, because he knew my reaction would be bad. But...my reaction is always worse when he is fucking lying about stuff. If it means nothing, why hide it, why not talk about it, why not mention your colleague more at home? I talk about my colleagues (male, females) all the fucking time, I tell him everything, I go with my male coworker for a lunch - I tell him. Because I have nothing to hide, he sends me something funny - I tell my fiancee...Here I can tell they barely talk about me, which I should probably be glad he doesn´t discuss our intimate life, but not even mentioning, setting some boundaries?

It´s a lot..

Well we kind of made up, he seemed to finally realize how much it hurts me..but I still don´t know, I am still not over it, I don´t trust him now, I don´t know if I can trust it won´t happen again after a while...

1lf5eqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1lf5eqv/should_i_bother_reaching_out_to_an_old_exbest/,Should I bother reaching out to an old ex-best friend or is that friendship better left in the past as a memory?,"Sorry in advance for this being long. I (31F) partially just need to get this off my chest and partially want to know if people think it's even worth trying to reach out to my old ex-best friend (31F). I met my childhood best friend, let's call her Stacie, when we were 3 years old. We grew up going to the same small private school and were basically sisters. After freshman year of high school I changed to public school while she stayed at the private one, but we stayed as close as ever, especially once we could drive. 

She ended up coming to my high school's prom as a date of a friend of mine, let's call him Brad, while I went with my then-boyfriend now-husband, let's call him Tim. Stacie and Brad ended up dating through high school graduation (2012) and for a couple years into college. All four of us did freshman year of college at community college. 

When we all went off to the University, Tim and Brad ended up rooming together. Stacie and I didn't live together since I was finishing up a job obligation in a different city before moving there and she moved right as sophomore year started. I ended up with an apartment to myself and she lived with three other roommates, but we both ended up staying at our boyfriends' place a lot. 

By the time I moved down, school had been going for a couple months and Stacie had decided to try and rush into a sorority. Brad didn't want her to and I specifically remember talking to her about it in her car one night because she was torn on what to do. During that conversation she decided she was going to rush, I think mostly because she felt like she missed out in high school going to the small private school (by small I mean each grade having about 20 kids). I was nervous that it would change our relationship but I wasn't going to tell her not to do it for my own selfish reasons. Looking back, her decision that night is what changed everything and I wish I had said more of what I was feeling. 

Once Stacie joined, she was definitely loving it and I was happy for her, but she starting to change. I started to witness her instigating strange arguments with Brad. She became completely ridiculous and unreasonable with him. For example, one night the two of them were going to a party. Stacie wore tall stilettos (against our warnings) and predicably ended up in a lot of pain. Brad literally gave her a piggy back ride home for probably about 2 miles. Then the next morning she was pissed at him for the ""way he carried her"" because she was sore. She was screening at him and stormed out of the apartment and slammed the door. Tim and I heard the whole argument (paper-thin apartment walls) and it was just so bizarre. I started to see a very selfish side of her and she started to party a LOT which wasn't really my thing. I started to get more serious with Tim and we moved in together once our leases were up and Brad and Stacie broke up. 

Stacie and I just kinda drifted apart. She had a ton of friends from her sorority and I felt kinda forgotten about so I focused on my relationship with Tim and school and probably wasn't prioritizing her, as well. We'd still occasionally see each other but it took more effort than ever before. It seemed like she didn't care though. For example, on my 21st birthday we had plans to go to a restaurant and she was over an hour late while the rest of us just waited for her to show up and she didn't apologize or anything. I'd try to grab coffee with her occasionally but she made it hard to plan with her and if we did get together she literally would talk about herself the entire time, I couldn't get a word in, and she didn't care enough to ask me anything. I was really sad but I kept getting more hurt anytime I tried so I started to give up trying. 

My last straw came in 2017. Tim and I got engaged in January and planned our wedding for that September. I had to make the heartbreaking decision to not ask Stacie to be in my wedding party. I had other good friends so that wasn't the problem, it was just sad that she wouldn't be a part of my wedding day the way I'd always imagined growing up. She was always going to be my maid-of-honor but now she was just going to be a guest. We sent out save the dates in February to give people plenty of heads up and we sent out the invites in late spring. Both were sent to her and her family and they all RSVPed (our moms' are best friends and our families grew up together so we invited all of them). Well, about two weeks before the wedding Stacie texted me letting me know that she wasn't going to be able to make it to the wedding. Her excuse was that she didn't know the date of the wedding and that she realized she had to work that day. I was heartbroken. It seemed like a bullshit excuse considering how much notice she'd been given and that if she wanted to be there she could have talked to her boss about it. She'd worked that job for years and was well respected there so I'm confident it wouldn't have been an issue. Also, the wedding was in the area so not inconvenient, and I know it wasn't because she needed the money from that shift. That night I cried a lot, not just because she wasn't going to be there but also because I felt like I was mourning the death a lifelong friendship. I made the decision that night that this was my last straw. Stacie didn't care about me anymore and I couldn't waste anymore of my time hoping that I could get that relationship back. Her whole family came to the wedding but she was not there. 

Tim and I got married, started our careers, bought a house, and just started to move on with our lives. Over two years went by with zero contact to/from Stacie when she randomly reached out to me at the end of 2019. She asked if we could get together to catch up. I was on the fence about it because I really had moved on, but I felt like our ~18 year friendship deserved a second chance. We met up at one of our old regular high school shopping spots. When she saw me she ran up to me for a hug and was crying. I felt really bad that I wasn't crying too, but again I had moved on. We hung out for about 3 hours and it was the strangest 3 hours... She was acting so bizarre and frantically talked the whole time and she couldn't keep a thought path going. I could barely even ask how she was doing or anything cause it was so hard to get a word in. Afterwards when I was talking to Tim about it, I realized it was almost like she was on drugs or something. It's hard to explain how strange it was. I told myself that I tried, it was weird AF, and that I really was done. 

During the 2020 COVID shutdown, she randomly invited me to a couple parties but 1) I was either TTC and/or pregnant which made me more high risk so I had to/wanted to take it all seriously and 2) parties weren't my thing in college so I'm not sure why she thought they would be at 26. I appreciated the thought and effort but I declined both times. I ended up having a miscarriage in the fall of 2020 and she knew it happened but she never reached out which told me she was done trying, too. In 2022 she did reach out asking if I wanted to go to our old private school's 10 year reunion (I graduated from the public high school but I still grew up with all those people and she's was asking me to be her plus one) but I felt really awkward going since I hadn't seen most of those people in over 10 years and the only person from that school I still talk to lives halfway across the country and wouldn't be there, but it was a nice gesture from her and I made sure she knew I was grateful for the thought (I also sorta felt like it would be crashing since I didn't actually graduate from there but I spent 10 years with all of them- it was a weird dilemma). 

That was the last time we communicated. Our moms' are still best friends and they see each other probably every week or every other week. I get the occasional update through my mom but for the most part they avoid talking about both of us since it's just kinda awkward now. I know she's single, a teacher, and just finished getting her masters in teaching. She also has dealt with some serious mental heath issues (which I have too so I understand) but that could account for the weird situation in 2019. Every year I still always send her a Christmas card.

I got pregnant again in 2023 and gave birth to my sweet boy last year. For some reason since having him, Stacie keeps randomly popping up in my head. He turned one recently and I'm starting to feel the heartbreak of the missing friendship again. I'm not sure why. It could be because years ago she would have been ""Aunt Stacie"" and I'm sad my son will never know her. It also could be that since I'm a stay-at-home mom now that I don't have coworkers to talk to and maybe the hole of no coworkers is actually the hole that she left behind that they temporarily filled and now it's open again. I have other good friends who are also all married moms and we talk nearly everyday but two of them ended up in different states so we don't actually get to see each other very often (and two are still local and we make an effort to get together every couple weeks). Stacie is still nearby and maybe that's why I'm partially tempted to try to rekindle something. But maybe what I miss isn't even Stacie, but the friendship we used to have or maybe just the idea of what a friendship with her these days could look like. 

We never had a big fight or anything, it just fizzled out as our lives and priorities drifted apart. Our lives are still pretty different though and I don't know if she'd even respond if I texted her. We still follow each other on social media but she never likes anything I post. She doesn't really post much but I hope she's happy and doing well. I should add that I'm a pretty timid person and reaching out to her would be hard for me. The most I feel confidently comfortable with is sending her the Christmas cards but that's a subtle gesture. At this point it's been a solid 10 years since we were friends. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions? Should I reach out or just let it be? Or if anyone might have any insight into how she maybe could have felt on the other side of all this that maybe I missed? Sorry it's so long, I just wanted to paint a clear picture.

1lf5ejp,https://i.redd.it/ycwbhopkeu7f1.jpeg,Open bottle of vape oil leaked overnight.,"It was just sitting open. By the time I found it, the oil had thickened and become sticky. I've been at it with a mild cleaner and some furniture polish but it's not budging. 

It's weird, I've only ever experienced them leaking during flights. There's no way I squeezed the bottle then sat it down, this coffee table was made by my dad decades ago and I'm always very careful with it. Anything I can do about this?",0,1750320866.0,wood,1,0.5,False

I’m planning to be in Dubai for the next month or so and would love to connect with the local startup scene. I’m working on a SaaS idea of my own and am wondering where I can find Dubai founders in the wild.

No agenda- just looking for good convo.
