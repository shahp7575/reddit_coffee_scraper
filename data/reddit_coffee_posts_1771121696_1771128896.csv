( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\---

I'd like to think over the years (in my 30's) I've learned to mask and blend in pretty well. I'm pretty ""high functioning"" as most are with Asperger's. I'm married myself and my wife is neurotypical. We have our share of day to day life issues and at times man feels like we are both keeping our heads just above the water kicking like hell. I often carry probably an outwardly frustrated, standoffish, and foul demeanor at times too others because of it.

I saw this couple both looked and behaved much ​more low functioning autistic. (I'm sorry I know how this sounds but to the NT if your mask is severely​ lacking and you don't care physically or fashionably like they do you straight up stuck out like a sore thumb)

They both had on the same video game ​character on matching t shirts and the female was ​attempting to move outta my way and force her significant other to do the same. I was in a rush looking for a type of coffee for my wife that she likes but as I walked past I stopped myself and turned back as she was looking upset at him and smiled and said ""y'all are alright I ain't gotta clue where to find the Columbian roast"" they looked over slightly acknowledged and went back about what they were doing.

They had been there for quite some time debating the different options, laughing, joking, and generally making ""​nothing"" ​into something fun and maybe a little complicated... But very interesting none the less.

I watched them a minute and finally found my box. There was nothing but joy on them. It made me so happy just to see that I almost shed a tear. Their shared special interest... The pride the had in not only it but themselves and the love between the two of them. No worries and baggage ​about the world around them and it's expectations.... just if they want pb@j coffee or some dragon blend.... Or maybe black rifle.

It ​was cool. I could learn from them.",1,1771128734.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False

It does NOT reflect my real-life views on corporations or career growth.

Paul had no degree.

No connections.

No impressive résumé.

Just overdue rent and a quiet fear of staying small forever.

Every evening he met his best friend Bill at a cheap café near the bus stop. The tables were scratched. The coffee tasted thin. But it was theirs.

Bill worked as a warehouse loader.

Long shifts. Heavy boxes. Unstable pay.

“My boss is a good man,” Bill once said, staring into his cup. “He apologizes every time payroll is late.”

“And is it ever on time?” Paul asked.

Bill smiled faintly.

“No.”

Respect didn’t pay rent.

Eventually, Paul found something else.

A company called Livanse.

High salary. Structured growth. Clear hierarchy.

The contract looked ordinary.

He signed it.

⸻

Ground Floor

The interview room was blindingly bright. High ceilings. Five people in tailored suits.

They asked about pressure.

About authority.

About loyalty.

About conflict.

Paul answered carefully.

He needed this.

“We appreciate your time,” they said in the end. “You have been selected.”

He was inside.

⸻

At first, everything felt manageable.

His supervisor, Robert Gindelberd, appeared calm and professional.

Paul worked quietly. Tried not to stand out.

Then he made a mistake in a report.

He didn’t notice it.

Robert did.

The next day, Robert addressed him in front of the entire team.

“A calculation error,” Robert repeated loudly. “In a company built on precision.”

The room fell silent.

“Perhaps numbers are too ambitious for you.”

Heat flooded Paul’s face.

“With respect,” Paul replied, louder than intended, “I corrected it before it caused damage.”

Silence.

Robert stared at him.

“Office. Now.”

⸻

Inside the office, the door shut.

Robert’s fist struck the desk.

“You think this is debate? This is structure. You either fit into it… or you disappear.”

The phone rang.

Robert answered.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Yes. Understood.”

He set the receiver down.

“You’ve been reassigned,” he said calmly.

“To the First Floor.”

No explanation.

Just movement.

⸻

First Floor

The elevator opened to softer light. Wider desks. Cleaner air.

Sterile.

A short, elegant man approached.

“Paul, correct?” he asked warmly. “I’m Lewis White. Welcome.”

Work here was different.

Sharper.

Paul reviewed reports from employees below. Four per day. Faster pace. Higher standards.

Lewis never shouted.

He refined.

“Efficiency isn’t effort,” he explained. “Find contradictions first. Memorize patterns. People repeat themselves.”

Paul improved quickly.

He started analyzing instinctively.

Even outside work.

Especially Bill.

⸻

Bill eventually left the warehouse.

“My boss was kind,” he said one night. “But kind doesn’t fix payroll.”

“So you left.”

“I chose survival.”

Soon after, Bill joined Livanse.

“I mentioned you,” he admitted at the café. “Everything moved fast after that.”

“Structure,” Paul replied calmly.

“There it is again,” Bill muttered. “That tone.”

They let it go.

On the surface.

⸻

The elevator doors began opening mid-shift more often.

New faces.

Quiet transfers.

Advancement without celebration.

It became routine.

Paul stopped reacting.

Months passed.

He felt himself changing.

He no longer defended.

He evaluated.

Lewis once approached him.

“Your friend is performing exceptionally well. He may surpass you.”

The words lodged under Paul’s skin.

Later, during a review, Paul said lightly:

“Speed without depth isn’t sustainable.”

Bill stiffened.

Lewis watched.

⸻

At the end of the month, metrics were displayed.

Bill’s name was near the bottom.

One of the lowest.

“Rapid growth masks instability,” Lewis said calmly.

After the meeting, Bill approached.

“What happened?”

“You were inconsistent,” Paul replied evenly.

“You sound different,” Bill said.

Paul almost reacted.

Instead, he asked quietly:

“Coffee?”

“Not today.”

⸻

That night, Paul couldn’t sleep.

He replayed the meeting.

Bill’s face.

His own tone.

He couldn’t remember raising his voice.

That disturbed him more than the argument.

When did I stop defending him?

⸻

The next morning, Lewis stood beside his desk.

No smile.

“Join me.”

Inside the office, Lewis spoke evenly.

“You handled yesterday too directly.”

“I was honest.”

“Honesty without control becomes instability.”

Instability.

“We observe ambition,” Lewis said. “But we eliminate volatility.”

“It won’t happen again,” Paul replied.

Lewis’s faint smile returned.

“That’s what I needed to hear.”

⸻

Two days later, Paul was called in again.

Bill was already inside.

Lewis placed a folder on the desk.

“There is an opening on the Fourth Floor.”

Silence.

“Only one of you may advance.”

The folder slid forward.

“A termination recommendation would create the vacancy required.”

“And if we don’t?” Bill asked.

“You remain here.”

No threat.

Just structure.

Bill looked at Paul.

“We’re not doing that.”

Lewis turned.

“And you?”

Paul’s mind was clear.

Too clear.

He remembered the warehouse.

“Respect doesn’t pay rent.”

Bill had said that.

“This isn’t personal,” Paul said quietly.

“It’s structural.”

Bill stared at him.

“You’re choosing this?”

“I’m choosing movement.”

Silence.

“I won’t sign it,” Bill said.

Paul reached for the folder.

His hand didn’t shake.

Not because he felt nothing.

But because feeling no longer dictated direction.

He signed.

⸻

Outside the office, nothing had changed.

Same desks.

Same light.

Same quiet.

Bill walked past him without speaking.

Paul stood still.

Waiting to feel something overwhelming.

Regret.

Triumph.

Anything.

What he felt instead was something colder.

Relief.

And that frightened him.

Because it meant—

The system hadn’t broken him.

It had aligned him.",1,1771128700.0,u_ABC_IDK-,0,1.0,False
1r551c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r551c8/ro_she_was_going_to_tell_him_tomorrow/,[RO] She Was Going To Tell Him Tomorrow,"She didn’t hide the truth because she was manipulative.  
She hid it because she thought telling him would cost her the best love of her life.

**It did anyway.**

Elara Voss met Julian Reyes on a rainy Thursday in late August 2025, outside a small West Village speakeasy that required a password whispered into a brass lion’s mouth.

She was waiting for a friend who never showed.  
He was there because a client had canceled a yacht deal and he needed a drink anyway.

He offered his umbrella.  
She accepted it.  
Then his name.  
Then, a few hours later, his bed.

Julian was thirty-four. A yacht dealer, occasional art flipper when boredom hit. The kind of man who moved through rooms with quiet certainty and never had to announce his presence. Women noticed him. He rarely reacted.

Elara was twenty-seven, an only child from a quiet Denver suburb. She moved to New York chasing modeling work that never quite stabilized. OnlyFans began during a financially desperate month in 2023 and, by 2024, became her primary income. It gave her freedom. It also gave her a life she wasn’t always proud to explain.

Subscribers knew her body, her humor, her carefully written vulnerability.  
They didn’t know Julian existed.  
Julian didn’t know about the page.

For six months, they were uncomplicatedly happy.

They flew to Tulum one Friday because he had a meeting that could’ve been an email and she had never seen bioluminescent waves. They swam at 2 a.m., glowing plankton flickering around their bodies like quiet stars. She laughed when a wave knocked him over; he pulled her close and kissed the salt from her lips.

Back in New York, the intimacy settled into small rituals instead of grand gestures.

Tuesday nights meant diner runs at 4 a.m. He ordered burnt grilled cheese. She stole his fries and drew hearts in ketchup. He taught her chess on his rooftop; she beat him twice and he accused her of cheating with “strategic distractions.” She mocked his terrible taste in 80s power ballads while he drove them upstate, windows down, volume high. Every time she walked into a room, he would look up like he had been waiting for that exact moment.

He provided without making it feel transactional — flight upgrades, rent quietly labeled “for coffee,” gifts chosen with attention instead of extravagance. He was also playful, occasionally reckless, affectionate in ways that felt grounding rather than overwhelming.

He made her feel safe and intensely wanted at the same time.

She almost told him many times.

The night they got small matching wave tattoos after Tulum.  
The morning he traced her stretch marks and called them beautiful.  
The afternoon he found her crying over harsh comments and simply held her without interrogation.

Each time, the same thought stopped her.

He’s too good.  
He’ll leave.  
I won’t survive that.

So she delayed. Posted softer content. Angled cameras carefully. Hid the necklace he bought her. Promised herself she would tell him soon — just not today.

February 14, 2026.

They attended a Valentine’s party at a glass house in the Hamptons. Ocean view, too many bottles open, people performing happiness for each other. Julian wore a charcoal suit that fit him effortlessly. Elara wore green velvet he once said made her look “impossible to ignore.”

They danced casually, comfortably, like a couple who had forgotten the performance aspect of love. People kept telling them they looked perfect together.

Then a drunk acquaintance clapped Julian on the shoulder.

“Man, how do you handle your girl running an OnlyFans? Respect.”

Julian laughed lightly. “She doesn’t have one.”

The man showed him his phone.

Julian’s expression didn’t shift. He just looked at the screen a little longer than necessary, then excused himself.

He found Elara at the bar, mid-laugh, mid-sentence. Touched her elbow gently.

“Hey. Come outside with me for a second?”

The porch was cold. A single yellow light. Gravel driveway stretching into dark silence.

He handed her the phone.

Her own face smiled back at her — lingerie, fairy lights, a caption about gratitude.

Her voice trembled. “Babe… I’m so sorry. I meant to tell you. I swear I tried. Every time I wanted to, it felt impossible because you’re… you’re everything, Julian. I kept thinking if I just waited for the right moment—”

He looked at her quietly, like he was committing her to memory rather than judging her.

“You’ve been great,” he said softly.

The gentleness hurt more than anger would have.

“You gave me some of the best experiences of my life. Tulum waves. Sunrise coffee. 4 a.m. diner ketchup hearts. The way you laugh when you lose control. The way you look at me like I matter more than I probably deserve. I’ll always love you for that. You gave me real happiness.”

He paused.

“But I’m not the guy for you.”

Her knees gave out before she processed the words. She collapsed onto the wooden boards, hands bracing instinctively, a sound escaping her that didn’t even feel like it belonged to her.

He crouched, brushing hair away from her tear-streaked face.

“I believe you’d delete everything tonight if I asked,” he said gently. “Burn it all down for me. And I still wouldn’t stay.”

She clutched his sleeve. “Please… Julian… don’t…”

He stood, looking down at her with something that wasn’t anger, wasn’t contempt — just finality.

“Love you, Elara.”

Gravel crunched. Car door shut. Engine started. Taillights faded into darkness.

She remained on the porch long after the cold seeped through the velvet of her dress, whispering his name like repetition could reverse reality.

Inside, laughter and music continued as if nothing irreversible had just happened.

When she finally stood, she didn’t go back in.  
She walked to the edge of the driveway and stared at the empty road where his car had disappeared.

Bottom of Form

She whispered to the dark, “I was going to tell you tomorrow. I swear.”

As if that would’ve changed anything.

Julian went back to his life the way high-functioning men do — quietly, efficiently, without spectacle. He drank more for a few weeks, worked more for a few months, and eventually resumed selling yachts to men who loved power more than people. He didn’t talk about her. He didn’t spiral. He just… continued.

Elara stopped posting for a while. The camera felt like an accusation now. Food tasted like cardboard. Most nights she sat on the floor of her apartment, back against the bed, scrolling through old photos she never had the courage to delete.

Time, as it always does, moved forward without asking their permission.

They both dated again. Met good people. Kind people. Easier people.

Julian still loved, but more cautiously. Less openly. Like a man who had once reached too far emotionally and learned the cost of trusting too completely.

Elara still fell for people, but never fully. She told herself it was maturity — boundaries, growth, self-respect. The truth was simpler: she never again risked being fully seen.

They functioned. They succeeded. Their lives looked normal from the outside.

Only they knew the quiet truth underneath:  
some heights in life, once reached and lost, become too dangerous to ever attempt again.

And so they lived well —  
just slightly below the altitude where that kind of love exists.",1,1771128680.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

1r54ymm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r54ymm,My Radiostatic friendship theory,"This is not about love, but friendship.

I have two main reasons why I think Alastor doesn’t like the word **friend**, and why things ended with Vox.

**1) Some people get uncomfortable with labels.** For Alastor, calling someone a “friend” could represent something that can be lost. If you avoid labeling the relationship, any potential loss would be easier to cope with. This could stem from a lot of personal experiences, like struggling with trust, losing people, or being taken advantage of. The fewer expectations placed on a relationship, the less vulnerable you become to its downfall.

**2) Power attracts suck-ups and clout-chasers.** These are people who befriend you for their own benefit. I imagine, as a human, Alastor dealt with this, too. People would have used him for his fame or power, or perhaps more. When he rose to power in Hell, smaller demons would’ve tried to attach themselves to him, hoping to gain something. Alastor would have likely kept them at arm’s length, waiting for them to either show their true colors or leave. This brings me to my theory about Vox, and I’m sure you can see where this is headed.  


Vox, impressed by Alastor’s power, befriends him. Alastor, as usual, keeps him at arm’s length, but Vox is smooth talking and ambitious, just like Alastor. In time, Alastor probably began to trust him, maybe even sharing parts of his past, his human life, his history, his ambitions. They might have bonded over drink, music, and dance. As close as Alastor would ever consider a friendship, anyway. He likely opened up about how others had tried to use him, probably in a joking ""How dare they!"" way.

After spending time together, Vox, feeling comfortable and genuine, might have offered a deal for a partnership. To Alastor, this could’ve felt like the ultimate betrayal. Vox had turned out to be just like all the others a long con to get something from him. Alastor probably told himself he should’ve known better, that Vox was just another liar. His “no friends in Hell” likely came as a result of that hurt. (He may have even seen it coming, considering how he was downing triple whiskeys, and his ears were back, almost as if anticipating something.)

Seeing Vox hurt might have given Alastor some sense of validation. Vox treating him like an enemy would’ve stung deeply, but it would’ve confirmed his suspicions that Vox was only ever there to use him.

Anyway, that’s just my theory.

\-------------------------------------------

On a side note, as much as I’m a fan of the *staticradio* interpretation of their relationship, I can see how Alastor might not “love” Vox in the way some people insist. It reminds me of my own experience as an Ace person. I used to be overly friendly with people, not because I was in love, but because I just wanted them to be happy. As an Ace person, I didn’t always understand the line between platonic and romantic interactions, because I didn’t really see a line, I needed to be told it. \[Not that I would touch or kiss people, but in general.\]

For example, I once had a friend stay over at my place. We didn’t have an extra bed, but mine was big enough, so we shared it. Nothing sexual, but rumors started circulating that we were lesbians. We would hang out, talk for hours, and I’d pick her up when she was having a bad day, buying her coffee. It felt like a normal, friendly relationship to me, but she developed romantic feelings, and I didn’t share them back. I was upfront with her, and it was fine, or so I thought.

From the outside, people could’ve seen our relationship the way they see Alastor and Vox, just two people who seemed close, but it was one sided from my side. For me, it was just being friendly, and I think that’s how Alastor might have felt about Vox. That doesn’t mean their relationship didn’t mean something to Alastor, it clearly did. Just like my friendship meant a lot to me, even though, eventually, she met my cousin and replaced me *haha*.

Keep in mind, this isn't meant to stop anyone's headcanon.  I'm just sharing my theory and rants. ",4,1771128440.0,Alastorcult,1,1.0,False

1r54xdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1r54xdu/sharing_my_positive_experience_sa_at_6_weeks/,"Sharing my positive experience: SA at 6 weeks, unplanned pregnancy found to be non-viable, very detailed","Sharing my positive story about my surgical abortion under IV sedation at a Marie Stopes clinic.

TLDR: Very accessible, great staff and proceduralists, on the day spent many hours being hungry and thirsty, found out via ultrasound pregnancy was not viable, completely unconscious for procedure under IV sedation, terrible post-procedure pain for 2 hours, pain mostly gone by evening, felt fine next day, minimal bleeding, abdominal pain 48 hrs post-surgery, felt better after several hours. Light spotting several days post-surgery to-date.

35F. Dating from the first day of my last period, I had my surgical abortion at 6 weeks, 6 days (although counting from my likely date of conception would have put me at ~ 6 weeks).

Finding out I was pregnant: I suspected I was pregnant because I had unprotected sex during my fertile window. I had a few instances of mild nausea, usually when I was flying. I was having trouble sleeping on very hot nights (skin felt unusually hot) and felt very off after having a few drinks one night. I was also unusually bothered by smells (notably: secondhand smoke blowing into my apartment, visiting my family and smelling mouldering vegetables in the fridge, car fumes, etc!)

The week after my period was due, I started getting occasional menstrual cramps and assumed my period would be coming any day. My period still hadn’t arrived at the end of the week, so I took a test, which showed a strong positive immediately. 

Choosing the provider and procedure: MSI has a great reputation (I read a few stories on Reddit of positive experiences). I was not keen on a medical abortion because of women's accounts of prolonged pain and the risk of failure. 

Booking the appointment online: Super easy and convenient. You just fill out your details and medical history, links to GP reports if you have them, you’re also asked if you’ve had pain, nausea or other symptoms.Their website provides a detailed description of what to expect from the procedure, it was really helpful and easy to understand. 

There is a tool to track your gestation date based on your last period. I believe you need to be 6 weeks to be eligible for a surgical/medical abortion. I would have been able to book an appointment the day after I found out I was pregnant! I chose to book a SA for the next week. They estimate that you will be at the clinic for a duration of four hours.

Cost: I can still scarcely believe it, but in the state where I live, abortion up to 16 weeks (surgical) and 9 weeks (medical) has been free for residents since 2022. I encourage you to search for the ABC Australia article which describes the terrible experiences women used to have trying to get abortions. The procedure was legal but practically inaccessible and often incredibly expensive, so well done to the government for responding. 

Morning of my 9:45am appointment: You have to fast for 6 hours before the appointment, so I had been fasting since I finished dinner the night before. You can continue drinking until two hours before the appointment, so I made sure I got up at 7:30am and hydrated myself as much as I could (feelign a bit nauseous I couldn’t skoll a litre of water). 

I walked to the clinic on a hot day and already felt thirsty on arriving, not ideal. When I got there I filled out the form (same info I’d already submitted online, I’m sure they have to quadruple check this stuff).

Consultation with nurse (10am): This took ~10 mins, she was really pleasant and friendly (as was everyone!) Went through my medical history, took blood pressure and pulse, explained the procedure and anaesthetic options. IV sedation is the default, that’s what I had. 

The nurse asks why you are having the procedure and checks that you are making the decision without coercion. My reason is that I didn’t want to be pregnant and I stated that I had come to the decision independently without being coerced. Again, I am so grateful that abortion has been legalised across the country. I can’t imagine how upsetting it would have been to have repeat conversations with doctors about the effect of a continuing pregnancy on your mental health.

Consultation with doctor (11am): Repeat check of my details and medical history, discussion of the procedure and aftercare. We went through a check-list of the risks and signed the consent form. I had an ultrasound (abdominal not transvaginal) to date the pregnancy.

This is where some unexpected things came to light. The doctor said based on size, I was 8 weeks, which was not possible based on the date of my last period. She then said that the pregnancy seemed non-viable because of a misshapen foetal sac. 

She showed me the ultrasound (you don’t have to look, I was very interested to see though). She explained that the foetal sac should be round and by 6 weeks, some tissue should be visible in the middle. The sac was very elongated, like a thin hemisphere, and there was some tissue in the corner. She noted that I had experienced pain (cramping). 

I had googled the cramping because I hadn’t heard this was a symptom of early pregnancy. Apparently it’s not unusual and is typically caused by the uterus expanding, and is generally not concerning if mild. But in my case, maybe it was not normal to feel the uterus stretching so soon (5 weeks), I’m not sure. The doctor said that she would send the tissue for testing at no cost. Miscarriages are common in any case, and technically I would have been a “geriatric” pregnancy.

I asked if I would have had a miscarriage without intervention, I don’t remember her equivocally saying yes (it’s probably  impossible to say), but she mentioned that if it did happen, tissue might be left behind and I’d need surgery to correct that. Interestingly, this surgery would not necessarily be free like an elective abortion! I assured her I was here to have an elective surgical abortion anyway.

Misoprostol administered (11:20am): I was given the two tablets to dissolve in my mouth to relax the cervix. The doctor told me it would taste chalky and bad; I was actually so hungry by this stage that I didn’t mind the taste at all and it stimulated my mouth to produce some saliva, I was also still very thirsty. I was given a pad to put on since the meds can cause bleeding.

Waiting for procedure: I went back to the general waiting room and waited a bit over an hour, dissolving the drugs in my mouth. After about 10 minutes I started experiencing mild cramping and chills. After over an hour had passed, I was relieved to be called in for the procedure. I was told to text my support to expect to pick me up in 1 hour. It’s mandatory to have a support person come and get you and they must stay with you overnight.

Surgery prep (1pm): The nurse took me into a private room and instructed me to remove my lower clothing and put on a gown over my top. She left and I got changed, noting that I wasn’t yet bleeding. The anaesthetist came in shortly and introduced himself (it’s a stereotype that anaesthetists are fun and have a quirky sense of humour, and this was the case!!) He asked if I’d had sedation or general anesthesia before, which I hadn’t. 

Surgery (1:10pm): I was led into the surgery, where the nurse and doctor were all prepped. Things happened very quickly from now on. Everyone was very chill, I was instructed to lie on the bed on my back (there were no stirrups, thankfully. Like many women, I’ve had a bad gynecological experience with my feet restrained). We chatted about my career while I was cannulated and had the mask put on, and I very quickly went to sleep. I was not at all aware during the procedure so the next part is based on the briefing info!

Procedure: The contents of the pregnancy was removed with suction since mine was an early pregnancy. Afterwards, they inserted pain relief (Voltaren, an NSAID) and the antibiotic metronidazole rectally. This avoids the gastrointestinal upset of taking the drugs on an empty stomach.

Waking up (some time around 1:45pm): As if no time had passed, I woke up in the recovery room. Presumably I was still wearing the gown and I then put the rest of my clothes back on. I was pretty disoriented and moved very slowly. As the wooziness faded, the pelvic pain started ramping up, as well as some nausea.

At some point I was in another seat across the room and given some water and black coffee. I don’t remember if I requested this; I have some food allergies so juice wasn’t an option. I may have been offered something to eat or maybe not, I had brought a sandwich but didn’t feel like eating at all. I was handed a packet of the antibiotic azithromycin and told to take it later after I got some food in me. 

I was given an anti-nausea pill and two paracetamol, and I can confidently say this did jack shit for the pain, which proceeded to worsen. I was told I could take more paracetamol at 6pm and ibuprofen at 10pm (!!!) 

I sat for some time, feeling progressively worse. I was asked a bit after 2pm if I felt ok to go home and I answered yes. I didn’t really feel ok but I didn’t see the point of waiting in the clinic. My partner picked me up and led me into the car, half holding me up.

Post-procedural pain: I had extremely strong pelvic pain and cramping for close to two hours. Objectively this was the worst pain I had experienced in my life. I occasionally have very painful periods, and this was much worse. I spent this time laying on the couch, writhing around and making noises like a wounded animal, which was very upsetting for my partner. I had read some accounts of women in the US being administered fentanyl or other strong IV drugs with surgical abortions, and I wished I got some opiates too!

After about two hours, the pain lessened to the level of normal period pain. I had a shower, and although some blood was dripping from me, it wasn’t very thick or heavy. Over the course of the afternoon and night I only went through two pads. I didn’t pass any blood clots at all (it’s very common for me to pass big clots during my period). 

I had my sandwich and antibiotic cocktail and continued laying on the couch until dinner, after which I got into bed. At about 8:30pm, I decided to take two ibuprofen since I saw no point waiting until 10pm. Pain was very tolerable until a very bad wave that shot through my pelvic and rectal area. Luckily that passed after about 15 minutes. I then had a very good night’s sleep.

Morning after (Thursday): I had some very slight gastrointestinal upset (to be expected after the antibiotics). Barely any bleeding. Otherwise I felt pain-free, with pregnancy symptoms of sore breasts gone (I can lie on my stomach again), and the smell of the world is no longer making me ill! I feel like myself again 🙂 I worked from home and went for a walk, felt completely fine.

Friday: Unfortunately things regressed a bit, I woke up feeling a bit shaky and with some abdominal tenderness. I went into the office but felt quite rundown. After midday, I started to have spasms of abdominal pain (different from the pelvic pain I’d had post surgery). This ramped up until it was coming in waves and making me sweat and shive, so I went home and called the helpline supplied by MSI. The nurse told me that feeling waves of pain was abnormal and that if I was cold and clammy, that was an indication to go to emergency care. I was confident that I didn’t have a temperature, so I told her I would monitor the situation and consider going to hospital if the pain ramped up again. 

I took some ibuprofen and the spasms of pain went away after a few hours (again, I don’t think the OTC pain medication was doing much of anything). I still had some achiness in the lower back at bedtime, so I applied a heatpack which helped me get to sleep. The next day I felt much better, so fingers crossed I’m on the mend! Some spotting still which is completely normal.

1r54u7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PotentialUnlocked/comments/1r54u7k/the_real_reason_your_relationship_fails_according/,The Real Reason Your Relationship Fails (According to OXFORD SCIENCE),"Everyone thinks they know what makes relationships work. Communication, trust, chemistry, blah blah. We've all heard it a million times.

But here's what's wild: Oxford researchers spent years analyzing 2,000+ marriages and found something nobody's really talking about. It's not about grand gestures or being ""soulmates."" The marriages that actually lasted had five specific linguistic patterns that showed up over and over.

I fell into this research rabbit hole after my own relationship imploded, and honestly? It changed everything. Not just about relationships but about how we fundamentally misunderstand what connection even means.

This isn't some fluffy self help BS. This is legit academic research combined with insights from relationship experts, therapists, and yeah, people who've actually made it work long term.

## what the research actually found

* **""We"" language matters more than you think.** Oxford found that couples who used ""we"" and ""us"" instead of ""I"" and ""you"" had significantly higher relationship satisfaction. Sounds basic, right? But it's not about forcing pronouns. It's about genuinely seeing yourself as a team vs two individuals competing for resources, attention, validation.
  * The underlying psychology here is fascinating. When you use ""we"" language, you're literally rewiring your brain to think collaboratively instead of defensively. Most relationship conflicts aren't actually about the dishes or whose turn it is. They're about feeling like you're fighting alone.
  * **Try this:** Notice how you talk about problems. ""You never listen"" vs ""we need to figure out better communication."" One creates an enemy. The other creates a project.

* **Positive sentiment override is the real MVP.** This comes from John Gottman's research (dude literally predicted divorce with 94% accuracy, kinda scary). Couples who maintain a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions don't just survive, they thrive. But here's the catch, most of us are walking around at like 1:1 or worse.
  * Your brain has a negativity bias. It's evolutionary. One sabertooth tiger attack matters more than ten peaceful days. But in relationships? This bias kills everything slowly.
  * The couples that make it actively fight this tendency. They don't ignore problems, but they create enough positive experiences that disagreements don't feel world ending.
  * **Book rec: ""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work""** by John Gottman. This guy spent decades in his ""Love Lab"" studying what actually works vs what we think works. Multiple awards, NYT bestseller, and honestly the most practical relationship book I've ever read. This will make you question everything you think you know about compatibility. Spoiler: it's not about finding someone perfect, it's about managing conflict without destroying each other.

* **Repair attempts need to land.** Oxford researchers found that successful couples weren't the ones who never fought. They were the ones who could de-escalate mid conflict. A joke, a touch, an acknowledgment, anything that says ""we're still ok even though we're mad.""
  * Most of us are terrible at this because we're too focused on winning the argument. We miss the repair attempt completely or worse, we weaponize it later.
  * Your partner tries to lighten the mood and you double down on anger? That's how resentment builds. Tiny missed connections over months and years.

* **Emotional attunement beats everything else.** This is straight from attachment theory. Couples who consistently respond to each other's ""bids for connection"" (asking about their day, sharing something funny, even just making eye contact) stay together. The ones who ignore or reject these bids? Doomed.
  * Sue Johnson's research on Emotionally Focused Therapy shows that most relationship problems are actually attachment injuries. We're all just trying to feel safe and seen. When your partner scrolls their phone instead of responding to your story? Your nervous system registers that as rejection.
  * **Book rec: ""Hold Me Tight""** by Dr. Sue Johnson. She's the founder of EFT and this book breaks down why we fight the way we fight. Not surface level BS, the deep evolutionary wiring that makes you panic when your partner pulls away. Best relationship book I've ever read, hands down. Multiple awards, clinical research backing, and it'll probably make you cry probably.

* **Gratitude and appreciation need to be specific.** Generic ""thanks"" don't do much. But ""I noticed you did the dishes without being asked and it really helped me relax tonight"" is different. Oxford found that couples who expressed specific appreciation had stronger bonds over time.
  * Most of us think we're being appreciative enough. We're not. Your brain filters out routine stuff. Your partner making coffee every morning becomes invisible after a while, even though they're literally setting you up for success every single day.
  * **Try this:** Name one specific thing your partner did recently that made your life better. Text it to them right now. Watch what happens.

## the stuff nobody talks about

Here's where it gets interesting. All this research points to something deeper, our relationships fail not because we're incompatible but because we don't understand how connection actually works on a neurological level.

**Your nervous system is constantly scanning for safety.** When your partner does something that triggers your attachment wounds (which we all have), your brain literally goes into threat mode. You're not being dramatic. You're experiencing a physiological response that makes rational conversation nearly impossible.

The couples that make it? They learn to recognize this and pause before nuking everything.

**App rec: Paired.** It's a relationship app with daily questions and exercises backed by research. Sounds cheesy but honestly super helpful for building emotional attunement. Like Duolingo for not being terrible at relationships. The questions force you to talk about stuff you'd never bring up naturally and the psychology behind it is solid.

For those wanting a more structured way to work through all this, there's also BeFreed, a personalized learning app that pulls from relationship books like the ones mentioned above, attachment theory research, and expert insights from therapists. You can set goals like ""improve emotional attunement as an anxious attacher"" or ""learn healthy conflict patterns,"" and it builds you a learning plan from vetted sources. 

The depth is adjustable too, quick summaries when you're commuting or deeper dives with examples when you actually have time. It turns knowledge into audio you can listen to while doing dishes or at the gym, which honestly makes it way easier to stick with compared to forcing yourself to read after a long day.

**Podcast rec: Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel.** She's a couples therapist who records real sessions (with permission obviously). Listening to other couples work through their stuff is weirdly therapeutic. You realize everyone's fighting about the same core fears, just with different details. Makes you feel less alone and more aware of patterns you're probably repeating.

The uncomfortable truth is that most of us are carrying unprocessed trauma and attachment wounds into our relationships and expecting our partner to magically fix it all. They can't. But you can learn to co-regulate, create safety, and build something that actually lasts.

None of this is your fault. We weren't taught this stuff. Our parents probably didn't know it either. But now you do. What you do with that information is up to you.",1,1771128060.0,PotentialUnlocked,0,1.0,False

I’ve read all your comments and taken them seriously. I’m a stubborn guy, so let me give you more context.

Edit: English is not my main language and I do apologize if you see some grammar mistakes.

My girlfriend (23F) and I (25M) have been on an ongoing roller coaster. Recently, she’s been growing distant, and I’ve tried to reconnect. She’s tried in her own way too, but it feels like there’s an underlying issue that never fully resolves.

We’ve had our share of problems that have taken a toll on me mentally and emotionally. I’m not a perfect boyfriend; I can be late sometimes and I tend to avoid conflict instead of facing it head-on.

Last year, I found out she was talking to a few guys in a flirtatious tone. While I was working and she was at college, she met up with two of them behind my back. She says nothing happened and that they were just talking. I chose to believe her.

I set clear boundaries after that. We had some very hard conversations, and eventually we worked through it and moved forward. But if I’m honest, it affected me more than I admitted at the time. I tried to move on, but it stayed in my head.

Today was Valentine’s Day. I recently switched jobs and went two months without pay. My severance helped me survive, but I had to rely on my credit cards too. My budget is tight until my next paycheck.

Even so, I didn’t want her to feel unappreciated. With the money I was able to save, I commissioned preserved roses (her favorite) and bought a few small things I knew she’d like, all within my budget.

When I arrived at her place, she gave me a gift too. I told her I didn’t expect it and that I was really happy. But I could sense she was disappointed. I tried to brush it off and enjoy the moment.

Out of nowhere, she said she was tired and sleepy. She placed the roses on her table and told me she wanted to go to bed and that I should leave. I tried to convince her to spend some time together, but I understood the message and left.

When I got home, a close female friend texted me. We’ve been friends for six years, and she’s happily in a relationship. We have a long-standing tradition of catching up over coffee at a mall near my place.

I was feeling hurt and needed space to clear my head so I wouldn’t escalate things. So I went out. I didn’t tell my girlfriend because I just wanted a breather.

We met at a coffee shop, sat with distance between us, and talked. About 30 minutes later, the shop was closing, so we moved to a nearby bench. We sat on opposite ends and kept talking.

Suddenly, my phone started blowing up. It was my girlfriend. She had tracked my location, came to the mall, and saw me with my friend. I told her to come talk to me, but she started walking away. My friend suggested I go after her to avoid misunderstandings.

When I caught up to her, she started yelling at me, calling me an asshole and a hypocrite. She even pushed me. Apparently, one of the guys she used to talk to had seen me there and sent her a picture.

She told me we were done.

I want to make this clear: I hate cheating. I would never do that in any form. I recognize that I should have told her I went out, but my only intention was to clear my mind and avoid making things worse.

So I’m genuinely asking: was I wrong for going out for coffee? Do I deserve this breakup?",1,1771128010.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I’ve been wanting to experience more performing arts in Boston. I’m pretty easygoing, happy to just enjoy the show together and maybe grab coffee or a bite nearby after if people are up for it.

If you’re interested in joining, feel free to comment or DM me!

Would be lovely to meet fellow ballet (or just arts-curious) folks in the area 😊",1,1771127772.0,BostonSocialClub,1,1.0,False

1r54plm,https://www.reddit.com/r/feumanila/comments/1r54plm/medtechs_bullying_accusations_tw/,medtech’s “bullying” accusations TW,"first of all, it’s foolish to think na i'm one of those claimed “bullies” or one their friends. And don’t be absurd on impulsively hitting those “downvotes” as it'll just reduce the visibility of this post. Every issue deserves to be viewed from both perspectives hindi ba?

It’s honestly disturbing to casually drop random names and initials of people here on reddit who are just victims of exaggerated gossips. spreading half-formed stories without verified facts doesn’t make you informed. it makes you irresponsible. what’s worse is taking photos of people without their permission. circulating them just to fuel rumors is invasive and unethical.

the details on the previous exposé (the one obviously made with chatgpt) makes no sense. those are just accusations and are just prolly blurted out gossips to create an issue. to the person who posted it, you and your friends are probably just envious of those who u'r referring to. do you have any proof? they’re most likely just made-up and “exaggerated” statements from envious people. just sad abt what envy can do. if you are going to accuse them, please provide details (and i bet you can’t). what you all are saying are just vague statements. also, tinitignan nyo lang yung side nung nag-post kase nga siya yung nagpost.

you are just likely bitter at them for being way above your level. they must be the only good looking ones in the classroom, that's why all the jealousy-hate points out to them. and probably because they're higher than you sa mga quizzes, sorry, and you just can’t do anything about it. review na lang din kaya kayo lol

also, can’t argue na there's no proof. are u sure na kayo yung pinag-uusapan nila? maybe you all are just too self-centered and sensitive na naiisip nyo na kayo agad iyon. don’t tell me di nyo din ginawa yung pag-usapan ang ibang tao. and kapal naman ng face na i-tag agad yung usapan nila as “bullying.” were u directly targeted, or are you just assuming? did they directly call you offensive names?

 “laughing stock sa hallway” daw lmao I bet na hindi nyo naman kayang humarap sa kanila nor tumingin sa kanila ng deretso. matapang lang kayo pag nasa reddit kaya kayo nakakagawa ng harsh comments especially about their physical looks. hindi ba ayon na yung bullying? kahit face to face, still wala din naman kayo magagawa.

rumors na they will be calling out on medtech dept. and abcg, but what would they do? pagalitan sila? HAHAHHHAH the passive MT department will ask for a solid evidence, and do you have any? wala diba. after all these past issues, you still think na makikinig ang MT dept sa small made-up issue na 'to. you really think na may magagawa mga deans let alone our dept chairs? HAHAHA I'm sure nga na never nilang mababasa ito eh. trust me, wala silang pakialam sa mga surface level rumors. also, Kickout daw? 100% won't happen. honestly, kahit makinig sila sa RUMORS ninyo, they just can’t do that on legal terms. also, sa mahal ng tuition natin, mygod what school would like to lose high-tuition-paying-students, especially mga highschool alumni. plus also hearing stuffs na one of them should snitch to save herself from getting kicked-out. like what would they even snitch about? kick-out isn’t even possible for them lol.

now what the dept will do is ask for students to step-out and provide their testimonies, especially from sec 8, and I bet no one would even dare to do that. kasi hindi ninyo kayang panghawakan mga sinasabi nyo sa reddit. hanggang reddit lang kayo. you can’t say those things face to face. tama diba. hindi nyo kayang sabihin sa dept kasi di naman totoo mga sinasabi nyo. plus, our anti-bullying core group and its personnels (we know u) (k***) (a****) (others) is just as passive as any other anti-bullying orgs. they'll just easily side with the ones who filed a complaint and end up with no resolution. puro tanggap lang ng mga reports. they’ll just act as if may ginagawa nga sila. lol display org yan? parang mtsoc lang na puro for clout. and what’s worse is magiging victim lang mismo ng “bullying” yung mga inaccuse nila na “bullies.” familiar?

heard rumors that someone is calling-up on a lawyer and filing a case. like?? for what? you really think that the law can do anything about it? wala. and ano naman sasabihin nyo? na narinig nyo usapan nila? and you expect lawyers to accept that as valid? you'll just waste your money on your “lawyers.” ipang zus coffee mo na lang 'yan ate girl. thank me later.

also, ‘will become isolated’ daw? smh na even after all this online hate, you still won’t be able to look at them straight in the eye in class. oh hi sec 8. na kapag kinausap nila kayo, you probably will still reply gladly (especially the boys) with a big smile on your face kase ganon kayo. we know you. no need to be intimidated. just stay at your level.  you all are just too self-centered na feeling nyo kayo agad yung pinag-uusapan. kaya if i were you, i'll start being neutral with them na lang din. pumili kayo ng tamang side. and for the person who did the AI-made post on reddit, na I'm sure na from sec 8, start mo nang yumuko while walking around the room. your actions are shameful.

and to the other sections, esp. sec 1 na wala namang idea kung ano mga ini-snitch nila sa mga prof, hindi nyo naman na-witness ang mga pangyayari. nakikigulo lang naman talaga kayo e. especially ikaw ate gurl, we know ur bf very well. you all are just relying on rumors and nakikisabit lang sa hate train. can’t believe that medtech's top section is this impulsive and naive. palibhasa puro palakas sa mga profs and puro grades lang iniisip. it’s just disappointing that your intelligence works for exams but fails in real-life situations like this.

anyway, just another passing blurted-out issue created from envy. this post wouldn’t be here if guilty nga yung mga tintukoy nyo. please stop all this hate kasi may mga ibang tao din na nadadamay. and please consider the facts before drawing conclusions. fyi, you won’t receive any form apologies from them. alam ninyo sa sarili nyo 'yan. think again kung sino ang “bullied.” hope we are all on good terms here. see you all around sb hallways",4,1771127654.0,feumanila,0,1.0,False

1r54n3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1r54n3r/the_psychology_of_silent_attractiveness/,The Psychology of Silent Attractiveness: Science-Backed Signs You're More Attractive Than You Think,"I used to think attraction was about having perfect symmetry or looking like an Instagram model. Then I spent way too much time reading psychology research, dating studies, and watching way too many evolutionary biology lectures on YouTube at 2am (yes I'm fun at parties). Turns out, most of us are walking around completely blind to our own appeal. Like genuinely clueless.

The gap between how attractive you actually are and how attractive you THINK you are is wild. There's legit research on this. And usually, if you're reading this right now, you're probably underestimating yourself by a lot.

Here are the actual signs people find you attractive, backed by science and observation, not just feel good BS.

**1. People get weirdly nervous around you**

If someone suddenly forgets how to speak English when talking to you, or they start fumbling with their phone, or touching their hair constantly, congrats. You're making them nervous in a good way. 

Psychologist Jeremy Nicholson talks about this in his work on attraction signals. When people find someone attractive, their cortisol spikes a bit. They get jittery. Their body literally responds like they're about to do something risky. Which, in a way, they are.

I notice this most when someone who's usually super articulate suddenly sounds like they're taking their first English class. That's not them being weird. That's you having an effect.

**2. Strangers are randomly nice to you**

Like REALLY nice. They hold doors longer than necessary. Baristas smile more. Random people offer to help you reach stuff at the grocery store even when you're clearly 5'10"" and doing fine.

Dr. Robert Cialdini's research on influence shows we unconsciously treat attractive people better. It's called the halo effect. Your brain sees someone attractive and automatically assumes they're also kind, smart, and trustworthy. Unfair? Absolutely. Real? Unfortunately yes.

If you notice people going slightly out of their way for you, and you keep thinking ""why are they being so nice,"" there's your answer.

**3. You get complimented on ""everything but"" your looks**

This one's sneaky. People will tell you you're funny, smart, interesting, have great energy. But they won't say you're hot. Why? Because they assume you already know. Or they're intimidated and don't want to come off as creepy or too forward.

Vanessa Van Edwards from Science of People has talked about how we often compliment attractive people on non physical traits because we assume their physical attractiveness is obvious. It's like telling a professional chef that their kitchen is clean. Like yeah, we can see that.

**4. People maintain crazy eye contact with you**

Not in a horror movie way. But you'll notice people hold your gaze longer than feels typical. Or they keep looking back at you. According to research published in Psychological Science, we naturally look longer at faces we find attractive. It's involuntary. 

If you catch people staring, then quickly looking away when you notice, then sneaking another glance, that's a massive tell. Your face is literally holding their attention without them meaning to.

**5. Your friends downplay your concerns about your appearance**

You say ""ugh I look terrible today"" and they hit you with ""shut up you look fine"" really fast. Almost annoyed. That's because from their perspective, you're fishing for compliments about something that's obviously not true.

Psychologically, this is called reassurance seeking, and when you're actually attractive, people get tired of reassuring you because to them it seems ridiculous. It's like someone with a PhD constantly asking if they're smart enough.

**6. People assume you're taken**

You rarely get asked out directly, or people seem surprised you're single. This happens because potential partners assume someone who looks like you is definitely already in a relationship. It's honestly one of the most annoying side effects of being attractive that nobody talks about.

There's a study from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology about this. People are actually LESS likely to approach highly attractive individuals because they assume rejection is inevitable. So if you're wondering why nobody makes a move, it might be because you're inadvertently too intimidating.

**7. You notice people copying you**

Mirroring is one of the oldest attraction signals in the book. If people copy your body language, your speaking patterns, or even your interests after hanging out, they're subconsciously trying to build rapport because they like you.

Dr. Tanya Chartrand's research on the chameleon effect shows we automatically mimic people we're drawn to. So if someone suddenly starts ordering the same coffee as you or picks up your phrases, you're influencing them more than you realize.

**8. People remember random details about you**

Someone brings up a throwaway comment you made three months ago about your favorite movie. Or they remember your coffee order after meeting you once. That's not them having a freakishly good memory. That's them paying extra attention because you made an impression.

Studies on memory and attraction show we encode more details about people we find appealing. Their brain is literally working overtime to file away information about you.

If you want to go deeper into attraction psychology and actually understand what makes people magnetic beyond surface level advice, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from research papers, psychology books, and expert insights on social dynamics. It creates custom audio content based on specific goals, like becoming more confident in dating or understanding attraction patterns better. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. The app includes books and studies mentioned here plus way more, and honestly makes learning about this stuff way less dry than reading academic papers at 2am.

Look, attraction isn't just about bone structure or having abs. It's about presence, energy, how you make people feel. And most of the time, you genuinely have no idea the effect you have on others.

If even three of these signs resonated, you're probably way more attractive than you give yourself credit for. Your brain is just really good at gaslighting you into thinking otherwise.",2,1771127432.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

I left New England at 8 AM and had only a coffee and a diet Coke to tide me over through a 700-mile road trip (there is method to my madness: not eating or drinking meant I only had to stop once to pee and refuel.  Did the run in less than 10 hours).

So when I got to my destination, I ordered an absolute smorgasbord from Sonic.  Like, 10 items.  I'm fucking starving.  I haven't eaten since yesterday.

So imagine my reaction when the driver shows up and hands me this.  He did a literal facepalm when I showed him what was supposed to be in my order and was like, ""Oh, I gave your order to the last guy.""

I couldn't be polite.  The best I could do was just walk away without saying a word and get a refund through the app.  I cannot describe how insanely hangry I am right now.

What can I do in that 8 hours?? I really want to maximize my time. I’m planning to drop my bags at the hotel upon arrival and then have the rest of the day to myself.

By December, I was down 20lbs (SW was 205, at one point saw 179lbs on scale, but mostly was around 182/183lbs). I felt so good!!! Lost a whole size in pants, bra and shirt and people were noticing. Then came holidays, and as a mom to young kids, I found myself stuck at home in awful snow storms, with kids at home (daycare was off), stressed, exhausted and completely lost my momentum. What started as ""oh its one day"" soon became 14 straight days. Its mid Feb and I haven't found my groove back. 

For context, I lost 20lbs doing 18-20 hr fast days, lots of water, minimum exercise (about 2 hours a week), getting some good sleep and cutting 90% of bad carbs and sugars. I also cut my caffeine to 1 coffee a day.

Today, I stood on the scale...and Im 192lbs (from 183lbs). i feel awful. It hit me like a brick. Felt like I wasted the last 2 months.

So I am starting again...please please share stories, if you have any, of starting over and successfully losing weight.

P.S. Ramadan is coming up and I do fast. Any tips for that will help too. Was thinking I attempt 22-24 hour fasts during Ramadan, stuff my face with Protein and water, and do it again! Remember, in Ramadan during a fast, I cant even have water.

Well he's 22 and im 22 as well, so we're both the same age, he is a chill person but I can tell he gets stressed, I tried to at least get a few conversations but I would get too shy, I would join conversations about work that's all, I even tried to talk to him whenever chance I get when we're alone, however it ended up being a simple greeting, the other problem is that I don't have what it takes, I'm not beautiful even though I love myself, I'm not smart without needing to retry counting money. And I think I annoy him. I really do like him, I wanted to try to at least go out for coffee or go walk in the park, the only problem is that we both work in a busy establishment like other fast food restaurants, But do I even have the chance? What if he already got a girlfriend? Or boyfriend? What if he's not interested, what if he actually finds me annoying?... that's the hardest thing to think of, I tried to move past those feelings as he is my manager and deep down I knew it probably wouldn't work, I felt like its forbidden to date in a work environment. Now I understand that opinions dont matter, and yet it mattered to me whenever I think about it. I think about how he feels, how he acts, and I felt like I'm pushing away, maybe that's it. Because I would think about my sister's past relationships, I would get jealous but it also makes me scared, I get scared if I screw up, I used to have a long distance relationship, but it didn't work out as I hoped. And im scared of pushing people away, but so far in my life I was used to being alone. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I felt like those friends I tried to make find me weird, I thought I'd be able to find more friends but I really felt alone again. Like when I was a kid I would try to behave in my own way, but all it did was make people give me strange looks, I even developed a habit of talking to myself or talking to some fictional character and make up scenarios having a long time friendship with that said Character.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

since I was 3 or 4 at the time I didn't understand what's going on 

another time he had a temper tantrum when I was about 5 or 6 I do not remember why he was so angry about he kicked the coffee table or pushed it so hard that broken half and I'll walk in the living room from my room or the kitchen singing my brothers spilled yogurt drink on the floor still stuck with me 

much later on he started yelling at my mom when I was about 10 or 11 after coming home from shopping and going out to eat and she was in tears I do not remember what's about 

when I was about 13 or 14 we were supposed to downtown to the lake but my dad was so angry since we were taking so long to get ready since we have to pack sandwiches and food he throw tantrum as we were driving turn the car around then go back home 

2021 things got worse because of his drinking 

my dad was angry because he couldn't find the keys since we hit it and he have a temper tantrum once again he grabs my brother's guinea pig from its cage squeezing him and telling him who is the keys my brother was crying and he yelled at my mom later and she cried and we give her a hug and my mom tried to put sleeping pill and his drink we to go eat and do laundry once we come back he lock us out of the apartment duplex since me and my siblings were supposed to go back to school the next day since it took a while to get in until he finally unlock it a few months later my mom was supposed to take me to the mall but we didn't go to the next day since my godmother and her child were staying here for today my dad borrowed money for me like asking me to give him some like I thought it was for gas and told me don't tell Mom or something I didn't tell him much later

winter 2022 me and my dad were at the grocery store he went to go get something I'm assuming we forgot something he comes back with alcohol bottles hidden under the child seat I caught him and say hey I told my mom what happened the Summer we decided took him and his friend to the church rehab thing by my cousin's house he had to stay for a few days and we had to write letters and we visited him at the place and we were singing about some religious song in Spanish we may think this is the end of it he will quit drinking but nope he continues his habits anyways 

2024 things got pretty bad my dad was angry or drunk he took the car to go wash it and crush it in my mom has to work longer hours to pay for his lawyers and everything else since I was supposed to go to see friends in Chicago since I've known to take me my brother works and we have one car thankfully we want another one after the giveaway for free everything's paid down at Christmas gift 

 2025 my dad finally lost his job after his drinking he was probably drunk the site or didn't show up my mom and my brother had to drive to Wisconsin to get him I'm pretty sure he got his license suspended because of his drinking now he's working at Sam's club 

I feel like at any moment now they are going to get a divorced and my dad is probably going to move to Wisconsin or something and I'm pretty sure I have plenty of stories and it's just with him which is I updated and another post with more information about him and how is affecting my mental health and everyone else with my mom and my two siblings we tried everything and I don't know what to do anymore at this point...",1,1771126605.0,AdultChildren,0,1.0,False

1r54ai7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethelcain/comments/1r54ai7/my_theoryinterpretation_on_radio_towers_and/,my theory/interpretation on radio towers and tempest,"ok so. for instrumental track 8, radio towers, it's the ""calm before the storm"" because it literally precedes track 9, tempest (a song hayden actually kept hidden from us for almost 2 years since 2023), which means a ""violent, windy storm"" or tornado. the beeping in the background is the sound of radio towers (or hospital ECG, but i think that's unlikely) communicating with each other (as i imagine, nocturnally, against a windy backdrop), warning/signaling an incoming ""storm"" (tempest), which is why the track sonically transitions perfectly into Tempest. Tempest is the only song on WTIALY that's from willoughby's perspective.

ok so this next part's just my theory but this is how i interpret tempest. on tempest, willoughby is depressed and suicidal (the lyrics: i'll hurt myself if i want, i don't care; cause death, it takes too long and i can't wait), sonically represented by the track's violent and soaringly all-consuming electric, bass guitars, and synths (doom metal-ish, to signify the loudness of his thoughts)—the song is a ring and aggrandizes listeners to the divine theater (check her philosophy on the ring, the great, dark, and the proximity to god). the track starts with the lyrics ""can you hear them, the trains?"". tornadoes are known for sounding like trains in the distance. willoughby's greatest fear is the weather (a metaphor). the ""tempest"" or tornado is a metaphor for an anxiety attack/self-loathing, destroying willoughby and ethel's ""house in nebraska"" (an ideated metaphor for their love/relationship; also track 3 on PD). but the tornado, in actuality hits Shady Grove (ethel's hometown where tempest takes place), but in regards of impact, it destroyed my aforementioned ""house in nebraska"" metaphor.

willoughby and ethel likely had an argument in the first verse of tempest in ""i'll hurt myself if i want, i don't care"" (potentially even alluding to him self-harming) and ethel trying to fix/stop him (i'll reach into your body, and fix you if i could—waco, texas, ethel's perspective). being overwhelmed, willoughby likely snaps at her in ""do you swing, from your neck, with the hope someone cares?"" which also alludes to ethel's own generational trauma in ""family tree (intro)"" from preacher's daughter. willoughby also lacked a mother figure in his life ""i've heard it before, from someone who leaves"".

in the chorus (""i still dream of violence, angry at the waiting game""), willoughby likely wants to lash out his pain physically (violence) onto either himself/others. ""angry at the waiting game"" meaning he wants to die but can't bring himself to do it so he just waits ""waiting for my own"". ""always on my own""—willoughby felt lonely even with his relationship with ethel the entire time as he wasn't being fully seen by her as the broken boy he considers himself to be—""please just go easy on me, i am young and naive, i don't know what i need"". ""chain link on your lungs and sulfuric acid in my brain"" is a double entendre for me (also gives very strong sleep token lyricism for me) literal, or metaphorical:

a. literal: 

""chain link on your lungs"" - the tornado is likely making it difficult to breathe.

""sulfuric acid in my brain"" - the tornado is accompanied by sulfuric acid rain OR willoughby's mind neurotically affected by drugs as his coping mechanism (""smoking that shit your daddy smoked in vietnam""—dust bowl)

b. metaphorical (more likely one):

""chain link on your lungs"" - ethel is suffocating mentally from seeing willoughby suffer

""sulfuric acid in my brain"" - willoughby's mind is mentally ""poisoned"" (depression/suicidal ideations)

""dont ask me why i hate myself as im circling the drain"". to ""circle the drain"" is an idiom to inexorably fail/deteriorate (likely suicide, in his case) from willoughby's extreme self-loathing (i also do not find it coincidental that it mirrors the spiral structure of a tornado, likely intentional). ""i'm gonna regret this forever"" likely means he's deciding whether or not to take his own life at the moment (which happens at the midpoint of the song). his anxiety and self-loathing only gets worse as the song continues in the outro—hence the visceral and sonically suffocating instrumentation with the repetitive, all-consuming ""forever"" (a common sentiment for mentally disturbed people, believing their suffering is forever), sounding simultaneously like being trapped in a tornado and psychological suffocation. 

there are also sections of that repetitive ""forever"" outro, specifically between the forevers where the soaring guitars sound like tornado sirens, albeit ""gone awry"" as it sounds alarmingly loud and critical. the song abruptly ends, signifying we will never truly know willoughby from ethel's perspective. he was facing ""away"" from her the entire time (WTIALY album cover), ""yeah you've changed (the change likely him being depressed/suicidal coming as a surprise to ethel) but did i ever know you? or did i hold you, facing away from me?—waco, texas), which means ethel never truly knew or ""loved"" him because she failed to understand his psychological issues and was not able to help him at his worst.

between the forevers, there are also adlibs in the background whose lyrics and melody she sampled from one of her unreleased soundcloud tracks ""doe hunting"" in 2020 (she has HUNDREDS of unreleased tracks everywhere on soundcloud, albeit under her different aliases before her current stage name ethel cain): ""you come around here just to watch me writhe, am i what you think about all late at night, you can try to stop me, hold me, do all the things that you do, but it's no good"", i think these lyrics signify the utter helplessness and hopelessness mentally ill people experience—believing that nothing can get them out of that spiraling (like a tornado).

akin to ethel, willoughby suffers from generational trauma from his father. however, willoughby is the usual one consoling/comforting her (from lyrics of nettles ""tell me all the time, not to worry"" and dust bowl ""you'll wait if i'll have to make sure""). when contrasted, ethel (the character) subconsciously and selfishly placed him on a pedestal to be her savior (""i am young and naive, i don't know what i need""), and left him at the first (?) crack of him actually being real, human, and imperfect (him being depressed/suicidal in tempest)—""left him curled between the couch and the coffee table when it all got too loud"", from ""diary of a preacher's daughter"", so she ultimately left willoughby in that moment all alone during his ""tempest"", signifying the fall/end of their imperfect relationship, which she later regrets on in waco, texas (the aftermath of ethel reflecting from the start to end of their failed relationship): ""and darling time, may forgive me, but i won't"". 

also, forever is repeated ""16 times"" in the outro of tempest (from 6:22–9:30). willoughby tucker is 16 years old in WTIALY, do with that info what u want

No Hallmark cards or cursive ink,

Just blood in the tray and spit in the sink.

Watching the ghosts of the lovers pass.

He’s balls-deep in trauma and charting the dead,

With a cold cup of coffee and a void in his head.

The nurse snaps her gloves, a sharp, rubber crack,

Rubbing the ache in her vertebrae back.

She’s holding a hand that’s calloused and old,

While her own bed at home is empty and cold.

•

The cops stand guard by the sliding glass,

Watching the dregs and the wreckage pass.

No roses for them, just a Kevlar vest,

And the spit of a drunk on a badge-pinned chest.

They’re tethered to gurneys by cuffs and by grime.

Killing their Valentine’s an hour at a time.

In the corner, the ""lonely"" are easy to spot,

With the tremors, the coughs, and the stomach in knots.

They’ve got no one to call for a ride or a coat,

Just a bitter, dry lump at the back of the throat.

And the rhythmic thud of a heart gone numb.

Just animals huddling against the dark.

1r547bx,https://i.redd.it/78fh5qc2vkjg1.jpeg,"Staying in the Driver's Seat: Why Early Home Care is a Strategy, Not a Surrender","There is a specific kind of quiet that settles over a home when you start realizing the stairs feel a little steeper or the yard feels a little wider. You’re fine—truly, you are. You’re making your coffee, keeping your appointments, and living your life. But in the back of your mind, there’s a small, persistent 

whisper: What if?

Deciding to look into home care when you don’t ""need"" it yet is one of the most difficult, yet profoundly kindest things you can do for your future self. It feels like a surrender, but in reality, it’s a strategic maneuver to keep your independence exactly where it belongs—in your hands.

The Myth of ""Not Yet""

We often treat home care like an emergency break, something to be pulled only when a crisis hits. But waiting for a fall or a sudden illness means the decision is made for you by doctors, frantic family members, or sheer necessity.

When you explore care options while you are still feeling capable, you aren't admitting defeat. You are auditioning partners. You get to decide who enters your space, what kind of personality meshes with yours, and exactly how much (or how little) help you want.

Trading To-Dos for To-Enjoy

Sometimes, the ""need"" isn't about physical frailty; it’s about energy conservation.

If someone else handles the heavy laundry, do you have more energy for your grandkids?

If someone else drives at night, do you see your friends more often?

If a professional helps manage the complex paperwork of modern life, does your blood pressure stay lower?

By bringing in a little help before it’s ""required,"" you aren't becoming a ""patient."" You’re becoming a CEO who delegates the chores so you can focus on the life you’ve spent decades building.

A Gift to Your Loved Ones

Perhaps the most ""human"" part of this transition is the relief it provides to those who love you. When your children or friends see you proactively setting up a safety net, their role shifts from worriers back to family. 

You take away the burden of them having to ""have the talk"" with you later.

The Bottom Line

Accepting a little help isn't the beginning of the end; it’s the beginning of a new way to stay exactly where you are. It’s okay to feel a bit of grief for the version of you that did it all alone, but there is a quiet bravery in saying: ""I'm going to make this plan while I’m the one in charge.""",1,1771126048.0,AZSeniorHomeCare,0,1.0,False

I sat there, turning pages and sipping a blend that smelled faintly of oolong and watermelon. I had told the server I wanted something different, but ""not too crazy."" He laughed and asked, ""What do you mean by crazy?"" It made me smile. I just meant that I’m not a fan of mint or strong herbs; I’ve always been loyal to my green tea.



By the time my stay was up, I realized a few teardrops had stained the pages of the book. Perhaps it was because you never showed up, or perhaps it was because of that line where Judy’s mom says, “Most people call this a weed because it’s just a flower growing where no one intended it to grow.” Or maybe... it was both.



When I finally gathered enough courage to send you the message, I knew you were worth it. Because I want to give you an answer. Because I want to tell you who I was before I met you, I’d answer any question you have... but after all the heartbreaks, am I still just a naive girl ?!



I was so angry with you. I thought that if I can lift you up, I also know how to break you down. It’s the instinct of a wounded soul: wanting the other person to feel the weight of the same pain.



But then, by some divine timing, my teacher taught me the Shakti Mudra that night. Like the thumbs hiding inside that ""cave"" of fingers, I once again remember to find my inner peace. It’s because of that peace that I can sit here calmly and write these lines to you.



Under normal circumstances, I would never forgive you. But because our situation is unique, itcan’t be judged by ordinary rules. I’m angry because you let your ego stand above our love, yet I must admit,  it’s your strength, not bending, that captivates me most. 



People say that I’m strong, but only I know how much I long to be protected in your arms. You’re the one who awakens the fragile, tender woman within me and I believe only you can do that. If our path had been smooth like others, perhaps we wouldn’t love and understand each other as deeply as we do now. I believe between us, there is both destiny and a debt to be paid.



So let life continue to test us. But one day if your heart is tired and you choose to leave, I will not hold you back; I will only wish you well. My heart will remain right here, not come, not go.

im a 34F diagnosed with periodontal disease 3 weeks ago. I have already had a SRP done 2 weeks ago have noticed shift and wiggling in my teeth especially my lower front teeth. I've always brushed my teeth 2x a day and used mouthwash at night, but never really flossed much unless I got food stuck in between my teeth. oral hygiene was never really talked about growing up and i was never taken to get regular cleanings as a child. i was raised by a single father who had to work alot to provide for us so he never gave it much thought. I have been a long time smoker but am now trying to cut back and quit which has not been easy by no means. my dentist really was no help in telling me which products to use or how severe this disease was, she only told me her main concern was my 2 lower front teeth with severe recession and bone loss. alot of my gum pockets on the sides were 3s and 4s with some 5s but my front teeth had some 7s. I have already book an appointment with a periodontist, so really looking forward to meeting him. my dental hygienist was a absolute sweetheart and said that my teeth can be saved with a bone graft and gum graft. my oral routine has picked up alot now. my main concern is at least keeping my natural teeth for as long as possible.

Morning: 

eat and drink a cup of coffee 

floss with string and interdental floss

waterfloss

mouthwash 

then brush teeth for 2 mins really focusing on the gum line 

Lunch time:

I usually dont eat lunch but I do still floss throughout the day and use xylitol gum and now try to drink plenty of water as well.

Afternoon: 

eat dinner 

floss with string and interdental floss 

water floss (every 3 days I add 3% hydrogen peroxide and water)

brush teeth for 2 mins

and then I use a biotene rinse that helps with dry mouth and has xylitol in it 

I plan to start using probiotics pills and lozenges 

 

I am looking for any and all advice and just honesty about my teeth.

Also I have a little boy who im am now so strict about making sure he brushes and flosses his teeth as well 

so he doesn't have to go through this as well. so any advice for making sure he keeps a good oral hygiene as well would be greatly appreciated.",3,1771125388.0,PeriodontalDisease,0,1.0,False
1r53ywn,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r53ywn/how_i_use_chatgpt_as_a_personal_productivity/,How I use ChatGPT as a personal productivity system (not just for writing),"Most people use ChatGPT for writing stuff. That's fine but it barely scratches the surface.

I've been using it as basically a personal productivity assistant and it's changed how I plan my days, weeks, and projects. Here's what I actually do.

Morning planning

Every morning I dump my task list into ChatGPT and say: ""Help me prioritize these tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix. Categorize each as urgent/important, important/not urgent, urgent/not important, or neither. Tell me what to do first.""

It's not revolutionary but having something organize my chaos at 7am before I've had coffee is genuinely helpful.

Breaking down big projects

When I have something huge to do and don't know where to start I say: ""Break down this goal into actionable steps. Create milestones, specific tasks, time estimates, dependencies, and a realistic timeline.""

Suddenly the scary thing becomes a checklist. And I can actually start.

Beating procrastination

This sounds dumb but it works. When I'm avoiding something I type: ""I've been procrastinating on \[task]. Help me identify why I'm avoiding it, break it into smaller steps, create momentum with a 2-minute task, and build accountability.""

Sometimes just seeing ""you might be avoiding this because it feels overwhelming, here's a tiny first step"" is enough to get me moving.

Weekly reviews

Every Friday I do a quick review using this prompt: ""Help me review my week. What I accomplished: \[list]. What I planned but didn't finish: \[list]. Suggest what to carry over, what to drop, and how to plan next week better.""

Energy management

I told ChatGPT when I'm most energetic and when I crash, and asked it to design a time-blocked schedule that matches my energy. Deep work in the morning. Meetings and emails after lunch. Creative stuff in the late afternoon when I get a second wind.

Decision making

When I'm stuck between options I ask for a decision matrix. It evaluates each option on cost, time, risk, potential return, and alignment with my goals. Then recommends the best choice with reasoning. It's like having a consultant on call.

The one that surprised me most was asking it to help me design a habit tracking system. I told it my goal, and it suggested which habits to track, how to measure them, and how to handle missed days without spiraling. Simple but I wouldn't have thought of the system myself.

I'm not saying ChatGPT replaces discipline. You still have to do the work. But it removes the friction of figuring out WHAT to do so you can focus on actually doing it.

I've been building out prompt templates for all kinds of productivity use cases and it's become a bit of an obsession honestly.

Anyone else using AI for productivity beyond just writing? Curious what's working for you.

1r53x5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1r53x5u/played_with_a_quija_16_years_ago/,Played with a Quija 16 years ago..,"So I just want to come here and vent because I never considered this until recently, but my husband and I have always dealt with weird instances that are unexplainable. Sixteen years ago one of my old friends loved playing with a Quija board and talked me into playing with her one night, and we played for maybe ten minutes before it fully spooked me. So for example, my grandma nicknamed me “Wewe” and nobody in that room knew that, when it spelled that out the others in the room were just confused, but I then came out and said my grandma who had just passed away use to call me that.. I took myself out from the circle and I have never touched one again since.

Our first apartment was the beginning of our weird journey. One time we got home and every bottom cabinet in our kitchen was open but the cash we had stashed on our counter in a coffee can (with no lid) was there. I had a closet with mirror doors and I use to clean it regularly, one day I noticed baby hand prints and no kids had ever been in our apartment.. We’d be in the living room and then we’d hear our clothes hangers move on the rod, and our neighbor worked evening shift at the bowling alley so we knew it wasn’t coming from his place (he lived alone).  My husband’s mom came over to stay with us one night and she slept on our sectional, so me being a punany, I found myself on the other side of the sectional, and she said a little girl ghost came out into the hallway from my bedroom saying “Mommy come to bed.” I had a miscarriage less than a year before that happened. Which okay, that could explain the child fingerprints, and the clothes in the closet moving around, maybe that’s where the little girl felt safe?

When we moved into our first house we never dealt with these issues.

When we bought our second house things got WEIRD. My kids were so young and their toys would make noise in the middle of the night. My babysitter always told me she felt \*uneasy\* when it got dark outside, she said our house just felt spooky once nightfall came. Well one of my good friends offered to babysit and then she said the same thing. When I got home she was telling me about the things that happened while we were gone. And while we were standing in my dining room talking about it she told me she felt like it wasn’t a \*good\* ghost and the light bulbs in my ceiling fan SHATTERED in that exact moment. And he worked night shift at this time and I was use to the weird stuff happening, but I actually never witnessed a paranormal encounter like that in the moment.

So for example our door was a lock with a keypad, after he’d go to work I’d be laying in bed and all of a sudden the buttons would start to go off as if someone was trying to come inside. My ceiling fan had a remote but i usually kept the light switch off because I had nightstands with lamps, but the ceiling fan light would randomly turn on and off. We had just renovated our bathroom and when we came home from a trip our bathroom sink had been left running and the towel we use for drying our hands off was where the drain was and overflowed the bathroom, which led us to another bathroom renovation. But the worst part was I kept a rocking chair in the playroom and it would move on it’s own, but one day I was walking by and I SWEAR I saw a man sitting in it, and this bedroom didn’t have any windows so when I turned on the light it was empty.. I mean I have story after story, I could go on and on, but you get the gist..

Here is where things get weirder. Now we live in the middle of the woods. When we first moved out here I went and introduced myself to the neighbors and my husband ALWAYS whistles at me for my attention, and when I was waaaay over there with the neighbors I heard a whistle, we all did, and I jokingly said that it was getting dark and that’s his way of telling me to get my butt home. Well fun fact, it wasn’t him, when I got up to the house and told him that I heard his whistle and came home he looked confused, which honestly I figured he was messing with me. I thought he was just saying no to scare me. Until it happened again, I was down at the pasture and it was getting dark and I heard a whistle so I walked up to the house and again, he says it wasn’t him. That night my youngest screamed and cried, he claimed a tall black figure was crouched on our counter looking at me and he was terrified. There are still weird things that happen, but my kid hadn’t seen the figure anymore until last night. Now it’s getting to be bedtime and he is telling me he’s worried about me because he thinks the scary monster wants me 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴

And I want to add, I believe in God. I pray. I am not a church pew Christian but over the last few years we’ve found ourselves following His word a lot more. Well I just sat down and had a conversation with my husband and I told him that I feel like sometimes it’s like a dark presence is around, and I feel like maybe it’s the same thing that’s been messing with me all these years. I was watching a video just a little bit ago and a guy said a demonic entity had attached itself to him after playing a Quija board and similar experiences had happened.

1r53w0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1r53w0a/how_to_talk_to_women_without_being_weird/,How to Talk to Women Without Being Weird: Science-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"I've spent the past year diving deep into communication psychology, dating coaches, and behavioral science because I was tired of feeling like an alien every time I tried to talk to women. Studied everything from Esther Perel's podcast to evolutionary psychology research to random YouTube channels about social dynamics.

The good news? Most guys aren't naturally bad at this. We've just been fed terrible advice by movies, pickup artist BS, and a culture that treats women like a different species. Here's what actually works:

**Stop treating conversations like job interviews**

Most guys approach women with this weird interrogation energy. ""Where are you from? What do you do? Do you have siblings?"" It's exhausting for everyone involved.

Instead, make observations and share reactions. Saw this explained perfectly in *[Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models)* by Mark Manson (bestselling author, the book that completely changed how millions of guys think about dating). He breaks down how vulnerability and genuine expression are way more magnetic than trying to ""game"" someone. The whole premise is about being polarizing rather than pleasant, which sounds counterintuitive but makes so much sense.

Real talk example: instead of ""what do you do for work?"" try ""you seem like someone who either works in something super creative or something wildly corporate, no in between."" See how that invites actual conversation rather than a resume recitation?

**Your body language is screaming louder than your words**

Talked to a communication researcher who studies nonverbal cues and apparently 70% of how people perceive you comes from body language. Wild right?

Simple fixes that changed everything for me:
• Slow down your movements. Anxious energy makes people uncomfortable
• Take up space naturally, don't collapse into yourself
• Match her energy level but don't mirror everything like a creep
• Eye contact should feel like you're actually interested, not like you're trying to hypnotize her

**Stop waiting for the ""perfect moment"" that doesn't exist**

The research on decision paralysis is pretty clear. The more you deliberate, the worse you perform. Your brain literally starts catastrophizing and building up the interaction into something way bigger than it is.

*[The Confidence Gap](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704926-the-confidence-gap)* by Russ Harris (clinical psychologist who's worked with Olympic athletes and applies acceptance commitment therapy to everyday life, genuinely one of the best psychology books I've read) explains how confidence isn't a prerequisite for action, it's a RESULT of action. You don't wait to feel confident, you act and confidence follows.

Tried this at a coffee shop last month. Saw someone reading a book I loved, just walked up immediately before my brain could generate 47 reasons why it was a bad idea. Said ""no way, that book destroyed me"" and had a 20 minute conversation. Would've never happened if I'd given myself time to overthink.

**Ask yourself: would you want to talk to you?**

Here's the thing nobody mentions. If you're boring yourself, you're definitely boring her.

Develop actual interests. Have opinions about things. Be curious about the world. Listen to interesting podcasts like ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel where she does couples therapy sessions, gives you insane insight into how people actually communicate and connect.

For those who want to go deeper but don't have time to read dozens of books or listen to hours of expert talks, there's this smart learning app called **[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)** that's been genuinely useful. It's built by AI experts from Columbia and Google.

You type in your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic as an introvert in dating situations,"" and it pulls from tons of high-quality sources like dating psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio podcasts and an adaptive learning plan just for you. You can customize the length (10-min quick summary or 40-min deep dive with examples) and even pick different voices, including this smoky, conversational one that makes the content way more engaging during commutes or at the gym. Way more effective than trying to piece together random advice from different sources.

When you're genuinely engaged with your own life, conversations stop feeling like performance art and start feeling natural. You're not trying to impress, you're just sharing what you find interesting and seeing if there's resonance.

**The ""mysterious stranger"" myth is garbage**

Authenticity beats mystery every single time according to basically all relationship research. Women aren't puzzles to solve or games to win, they're humans who also feel awkward and anxious and weird sometimes.

Share small vulnerabilities naturally. ""Honestly I'm terrible at small talk so I usually just say random stuff"" or ""I almost didn't come say hi because my brain told me 18 reasons why this was a bad idea.""

Vulnerability creates connection faster than any ""technique"" ever could. Saw this play out in my own life repeatedly once I stopped trying to be some smooth character I'm not.

**Practice in low stakes situations constantly**

Talk to everyone. The barista, the person waiting for the elevator, the old lady at the grocery store. Normalize initiating conversations so it stops feeling like this massive event.

Also, rejection isn't personal most of the time. She might be in a relationship, having the worst day ever, or just not in the mood to chat. That's got nothing to do with your worth as a human.

The goal isn't to talk to women, it's to become someone who connects with people naturally and doesn't make half the population feel like an exotic challenge. Once you internalize that, everything gets easier.",1,1771125090.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

## A sample paragraph
Claire went outside again. This time she felt the North Dakota winter. A slap in the face that took her breath. At this temperature, breathing the cold air directly for long could cause your lungs to freeze. She backed up, pointed the light along the side of the house, under the window. There, by the window, under the ledge of the house where it was protected from the snow fall, were an indention in the snow. Someone stood there, breathing on the glass, watching Ben Stevens eat his last meal. Claire watched her breath turn to crystals in the air.

## What It's About

Deputy Detective Claire Sauer works murders in Ramsey County, North Dakota. She's spent ten years earning her badge and longer than that learning to live alone.

A man is found dead on his couch, throat cut, hands in his lap. A woman is found at her kitchen table, throat cut, a single bite missing from a waffle. The crime scenes are staged and personal — details that mirror Claire's own childhood. Someone is recreating scenes from essays Claire wrote in college, details only she should know: the tiny apartment, the waffles before swim practice, the missing father.

As Claire tracks the killer across a frozen county, she meets Danyelle — a blonde waitress at Rosie's Diner who makes her coffee right and won't stop looking at her. The relationship builds through food, small gestures, and crisis while Claire races to stop a killer who is getting closer to the source material: her.

The case resolves. The relationship is just beginning.

## What I'm Looking For From You

I'm not looking for copyediting. There may be typos. Ignore them. I need your honest reaction to the reading experience. Here are specific questions, but feel free to tell me anything that comes to mind.

### Pacing
- Where, if anywhere, did you want to put the book down?
- Did the story feel rushed at any point?
- Did the story drag at any point?
- Were the scene breaks clear or confusing?

### Character
- Does Claire feel like a real person? Where did you connect with her? Where didn't you?
- Do you trust Danyelle? At what point did you decide?
- Does Pritchard feel like a man carrying a secret?
- Did any character feel underdeveloped or unnecessary?

### The Relationship
- Does the connection between Claire and Danyelle feel earned or rushed?
- Did the relationship feel authentic — like two real people finding each other — or did it feel like a plot device?
- Were there moments that felt like romance novel tropes? If so, where?
- Did Claire's sexuality feel naturally integrated or did it feel like a statement?

### The Crime
- Were you able to follow the investigation?
- Did the killer's reveal feel earned or did you guess too early?
- Were the crime scenes clear or confusing?
- Did the staged crime scenes — the connection to Claire's past — land for you?

### Voice and Tone
- Did the writing style work for you? Was there anywhere the voice felt inconsistent?
- Did the North Dakota setting feel real or like set dressing?
- Were there lines or passages that stood out — for better or worse?
- Did the ending satisfy you?

### The Big Questions
- Would you read Book 2?
- Would you recommend this to a friend? What would you tell them it's about?
- What's the one thing you'd change?
- What's the one thing you wouldn't touch?

---

## A Few Things to Know Going In

- This is a novella, not a full novel. The length is intentional. It's meant to be read in one sitting.
- The relationship between Claire and Danyelle is a subplot, not the main plot. If you remove the romance, the crime still works. That's by design.
- Claire and Danyelle are not a trope. There's no love triangle, no breakup-to-makeup, no will-they-won't-they. Danyelle doesn't leave. The tension is Claire — her darkness, her isolation, her struggle to let someone in.
- This is the first book in a seven-book series. Some threads are left deliberately open. Smith's motive is not fully explained. A character named Barrow is introduced but not resolved. These are seeds, not loose ends.
- The cold is not a backdrop. It's a character. If the weather feels oppressive, that's intentional.

---

## Timeline

Please try to read and respond within two weeks. A few sentences per question is plenty. If all you send me is ""I stayed up until 2 AM to finish it"" or ""I put it down at chapter four,"" that tells me what I need to know.

Thank you for your time. I mean that.

It really is a holiday that arrived too soon for its own good. It just feels like it should be in late February. The fourteenth is too early, it is somehow already here. And by book still isn't done. We are getting there though. I gave myself a break from writing last night but today I wrote a good 1,070 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. It is a good start to the current scene, though I was hoping I'd have gotten further in my outline. I did have to take a break from writing for a while because I got a nose bleed so maybe I can blame some slowness on that. It wasn't a long bleed but it was annoyingly heavy. It has gotten warmer recently–not warm, mind you, but not incredibly frigid–and as I have already mentioned my body doesn't handle those sorts of shifts easily. I am glade that I seem to have outgrown the chronic migraines at least \[knock on wood\]. A whole day spent in agony in bed is the last thing I need.

I think I will try to write a little more tonight but I worry that the frequent headaches I have been having will make that difficult. This scene is the last before the big finale. There is still a lot to cover but it is still a hurdle I'd be delighted to be over with. I am struggling right now just trying to write to you. I am late writing to you and late to having my evening coffee because Peach was sleeping on my lap for the last hour. Now that she is up, I am hoping a warm drink will wake me up enough to get some more work done.

Oh, before I go, I'll mentioned that Darling sent me an email. They don't writing much so it was a delight to hear from this in that way. Just as they find writing tiring, I feel the same way about phone calls. It is nice to talk to them in the way I am most comfortable for a change. I wrote back to them right after I finished writing before dinner.

Okay, I really need that coffee. I can barely focus on the screen. Hopefully I get my senses in order soon.

Worth it or just an upgrade itch?,"I’ve been using a DF64P for about 3 years paired with a Quickmill Aquila (rotary pump HX machine), and overall I’ve been able to make great coffee with it.

That said, I’ve never loved the grinder after some longer-term use. My main complaints are:

* The vertical design, no tilt or auger 
* The workflow is messy
* Slight “budget grinder feel” compared to the rest of my setup

I’m considering two options:

**Option 1:** Keep the DF64P and upgrade to SSP burrs (Cast, HU, or Lab Sweet — still deciding)  
**Option 2:** Buy a DF83V while it’s currently on sale

I’m trying to be honest with myself - I don’t want to upgrade purely for the sake of upgrading, and I’m not unhappy with my coffee, but I am itching for something different in my setup after 3-4 years. Ideally something that is nicer to use and tastes better. I have no real budget constraints, but can't justify buying a Weber or Option-O Lagom.

A few key questions:

* Would I actually notice a meaningful difference in espresso quality going from DF64P → DF83V?
* Or would SSP burrs in the DF64P get me 90–95% of the way there?
* Does the DF83V significantly improve workflow, retention, and mess compared to the DF64 platform?
* Is the upgrade more about UX and enjoyment, or genuinely noticeable in the cup?

For context:

* I drink mostly milk-based espresso
* Medium roasts
* Single dose workflow
* Not chasing ultra-light clarity shots, more balanced espresso with body and clarity

Would love to hear from people who have:

* Upgraded from DF64 → DF83V
* Installed SSP burrs in a DF64
* Or tried / compared both!

His focus has always been having a spotless house and kitchen. In short, he has certain ways he wants his knifes and cookware cleaned and wants our kitchen spotless. He constantly is telling me to clean things “now” and that I need to remember to “clean this, this way.” For me, I have the mindset that I’ll get to it when baby is asleep, but will do everything that I can to focus on my child during wake hours.

Our house is far from a mess. In fact, I would say it’s pretty tidy considering we have an infant and a large dog. Plates are always placed in sink and a random coffee cup may be left out but I never leave dishes or baby bowls out in the kitchen. However he wants everything stacked and organized in the sink with water stains wiped down 🥴. This definitely isn’t top of mind for me when I’m feeding and trying to entertain our child, not to mention, I’m somewhat forgetful of this standard my husband has set. My husband says that this is something that he’s inflexible with since he cooks for himself every night.

I think his little “rules” have stemmed as a result of him needing control in different areas and choosing our house as the area that he has control. Anyways… This is both our first time raising a child but some loss of communication and priorities have seemed to be at play here.

TLDR// What are some tips and strategies for bridging/having a conversation about how to approach different priorities as parents? Are there any books that can be recommended for first time parents learning how to adjust and meet expectations halfway?",6,1771124572.0,Parenting,37,1.0,False

To take or not to take meds…","Hi everyone! I’m about to make a decision that scares me a lot, and would like to know if others have go through the same as me. For context, I’ve gone through a lot in life (like so many others) yet never in my life suffered from anxiety or panic attacks, until 3 months ago and all because as the title says so… a freaking Starbucks drink. I had a matcha drink late at night (dumb mistake), and thought oh yeah I’ll get jittery like i do sometimes when I have extra coffee. An hour or so later, I started feeling weird to a point that I ended up in the ER for the first time of my life. Nothing was wrong, doc said it was a panic attack. That month and the next one I ended up in the ER 2 more times, went to different doctors to make sure nothing was wrong with me, and indeed nothing was wrong. So I accepted the fact that it was just anxiety. 

Fast forward, I learned how to deal with it, started therapy, meditation, breathing exercises etc and chose not to take medication. January was a good month for me, my anxiety was mild, no panic attacks, and I felt so at peace that my life was going back to semi normal. 

However, this month it’s gotten worse again and I’m thinking of starting meditation… when it was first prescribed to me i was scared of taking it, because i took magnesium (recommended by a doc to help me with anxiety) and i had the weirdest reaction to it, that it legit traumatized me. I woke up feeling numb, like no thoughts were going through my mind and it lasted like 10 min, like i couldn’t feel anything. That made me not take Lexapro and Melex. I ofc googled side effects and thought nah I don’t want to go through that and I’ve gone through other things and still been ok!!! My therapist was like I won’t push you on taking them but know that it will take way longer for you to be ok. In January, when I felt like things were better for me, my therapist said I’m glad but please know that your anxiety will/might come back and be stronger than before.

I am not 100% happy with my therapist, yes he has helped me but I also feel like he just listens more and not actually suggest things that can help or try I don’t think psychotherapy steps on each session that could help me. Anyway, sorry everyone for this long post but would love to know if you’ve had scary effects with Lexapro and Melex. What are your thoughts on why a stupid matcha drink started it all for me?

This month has been crazy for me. I recently got out of a relationship with my friend (which was insane in its own right), but now I’m facing a bigger problem.

I am a freshman in college and last semester I had a crazy start to everything. New found freedoms meant more drugs and hooking up than I did in highschool. On one particular night I had snuck into a club with friends and were enjoying our night. We befriended a group of women, all in their mid twenties and had fun with them most of the night. One of them, let’s call her Bea, was making eyes with me the whole night. After we had hit another club with this women and the night was coming to an end she and I happened to be walking back in the same direction (towards my school) so we decided to walk together for safety. She is GORGEOUS, long blonde hair, a smile that could make your heart stop, and soft hands. We got to talking on our walk and by the time we got back to her place she invited me inside. One thing lead to another and we ended up doing lines of coke and having sex. The next morning she gave me her number and I went about my day. I texted her asking if she wanted to get coffee sometime but she never responded.

That brings me around to this semester where I have been putting a lot more focus on my academics. I have multiple big lecture classes because it is my first year, one of them had a TA. He was chill, we were cool, but recently he got diagnosed with cancer and decided to go back to his home country to seek treatment there.

The next day, following the news of his departure, I am sitting in my seat trying to stay awake when my professor introduces the new TA and she walks down the aisle and sits down at the TA desk and waves to everyone. It is her, in all of her beauty, the girl who I hooked up with in the first semester.

I am really just distraught and all over the place. I have no idea what to do. I don’t know if she recognizes me, but I KNOW that’s her.

1r53ctg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1r53ctg/what_can_be_done_about_this_situation_with_my/,What can be done about this situation with my coworker?,"This is going to be an extremely long explanation, so I apologize in advance for the lengthy post. I could really use some advice on what to do about this whole situation. One thing before I begin however, I promise I am not here to spread hate about my coworker, that is not my intent with this. I just want this pointless drama to end. I am so mentally drained from all of this and other things going on in my life right now and I do not wish to continue this any further.

Basically, I work 12 hour days in a kitchen in a nursing home. I started in August of 2025. At first, it really wasn’t bad. I genuinely thought mostly everyone there was pretty cool, the work wasn’t terrible, and the pay is decent. Well, over the course of the past few months, there’s been a particular coworker that has been showing me a different side of themselves and causing trouble for me.

Let’s call her H, she’s in her 40’s. I’ll go ahead and explain my issues with her.

Ok actually, this isn’t one of the issues I’m having, but one quick thing about H; Everyday, all day long, she’ll do different things like whistle, clap her hands, say the most outlandish and out of pocket things you’ve ever heard in your life, or sing randomly, most of the time out of key. One time, one of my coworkers, let’s call her E, asked H why she does this. Well, H said it was because she has ADHD I think? I’m almost 100% sure that’s what she told E. I mean, I understand maybe she can’t control it, but sometimes it can be aggravating to listen to that for 12 hours, especially on the rough days. However, I’ve never said anything to her about it and I’ve never made it an issue. I honestly just try to tune it out at this point. (This ties into my story.)

I always thought H was just… questionable at best. I mean, one of the very first things she told me about herself was how she was once hooked on different types of drugs/substances… which isn’t really something you think you’d tell someone you just met. Besides that, she was ok at first I guess. We never had any beef or any issues with one another so…

Anyhow, I believe this is where this all started. There was a time that I personally wasn’t doing very good mentally, so I pushed myself away from people and didn’t really talk much at work. This was about 4-5 months ago. I guess H didn’t like the fact that I stopped really talking to her unless it was work related. I started getting told that she likes to talk smack about me when I’m not at work with other coworkers. There was a couple of people who told me this, so I suppose I believe them. Anyways, that’s when I started not liking her very much because that’s pretty deceitful behavior and not someone I really want to associate with. Even though this started with her talking smack, we still really didn’t have “beef”or get upset with each other. I just listened to music instead of choosing to talk to her, and only talked to her if it was work related or if we rarely chatted. Now, I can’t exactly remember when all of this stuff she’s been doing now started, but I want to say about 1-2 months ago, though it wasn’t as bad as it is now. The stuff she started doing was saying smart things to me, for example: One night we were short-handed, and I was one of the only ones there. I did not have time to re-stock the fridge after line service. Well, the next day I come in there, she’s stocking the fridge and she seemed upset. I didn’t say anything, but then she says to me, “And you know, the next person who doesn’t stock this cooler can kiss my ass.” Honestly, that upset me, and my response was, “I didn’t have time, H! I was busy doing everything else!” Then she goes, “Well you should have had the time to stock it.” I got a little more upset and told her, “I just told you I didn’t have the time to do it! What part of that don’t you understand, H?” She just kept on about how I should have had time, and that on nights that she worked with X employees, she was able to get it stocked. I just replied with “Ok, whatever you say.” because there was probably no getting through to her anyways. She said something smart in reply, I can’t think of what it was, but I just completely ignored her.

It just started with little things like that, but I feel like it’s escalated. For a little while now, she’s been a complete smart ass with me whenever I make a mistake or if I do something she doesn’t like. Here’s a quick example: The other day, 2nd floor called for something for one of the patients. Well, H never takes anything up to the floors, and also never answers the phone, so when she sat some biscuits down beside me and said something about “for X on 2nd floor”, what else was I supposed to think other than to grab them and take them up? Well, when I took it up there, nobody said they called for it. 1st floor also said the same thing. When the elevator reached the ground floor, there H was when the door opened. I said, “I don’t know who you said this was for, but they said no one called for this.” She goes, “Because those are my biscuits.” I handed them to her and replied, “Well, you sat them down and said something about it being for second floor, so I took it up.” Here’s her smart remark: “Well maybe you should ask next time before you take something up.” I just ignored her. It’s not like I did it on purpose, trust me. I don’t want to make a bunch of trips up to the floors when I’m busy trying to get other things done.

Now I’ll hear her cursing me all the time as well as her making smart ass remarks. When she gets upset with me, she’ll say things like, “If you don’t like it, tough shit.” or she’ll call me a “crybaby”. The thing is, she isn’t like, DIRECTLY saying those things to me. She IS saying them out loud, she’s just not saying them to my face I guess? For example, if she’s not facing me and she’s at the sink doing dishes she’ll say those things. (It’s obviously not always at the sink, just an example.)

Here are just some examples of things she’s indirectly said:

“You do too much complaining and not enough work.”

“I want my rotation changed.”

“They’re gonna have to find my replacement.”

“Since you never do anything around here.”

“Since no one else is going to get it.”

She’s saying these things after she gets upset with me or I do something she dislikes, and I know she’s doing it to try to get under my skin. I always choose to ignore these childish comments because I don’t want to give her the reaction she wants.

Another thing that HR has already been made aware of and something that has already been dealt with, is that I think she was purposefully misgendering me? I’m going to be pretty open about this. I’m a transgender man, I’m 21 years old, and I go by he/him pronouns. Everyone at my workplace has been very accepting, and at first I guess H had no problem with it. Everyone there only knew me as my deadname and she/her pronouns for only a month before I started testosterone and came out, so 5 months ago. Anyways, at first it seemed like she never struggled with my pronouns, and she respected it and called me what I wanted to be called. However, after all this started, she began to purposefully call me she again, at least I think… Well, I can’t actually prove that she was doing it intentionally, but it just seemed so odd that she suddenly had an issue with remembering to call me he after I upset her. The crazy part is that she would switch between calling me he and she, and when she called me she, SOMETIMES she would go, “he, sorry.” I did tell HR that while I couldn’t prove it, it definitely seemed like that’s what she was trying to do. I believe they took care of the situation, because funny enough, ever since I told HR, she’s only called me he (Well, at work I guess.) I mean, come on… Am I wrong for assuming that? I only went to HR because she kept doing it, even like 4 months after I started testosterone and came out. Maybe I was wrong to assume that, but all of the coincidences just seemed to add up…

Ok, let’s get to the part I’m really here to discuss.

This happed two days ago, so February 12th. I walked into the door, so not even 5 minutes after clocking in, and the first comment I heard her make was related to her having to pour the coffees for the breakfast line. “I shouldn’t have to be the one who does this, I’m going to talk to C about this.”

C is my boss, she’s the head of the kitchen. I can’t say she’s been the most helpful in this situation, but we’ll get to that. So, I of course, just ignore her comment and continue on with getting my side of the line set up. Nothing really happened on the breakfast line, but I think she said some stuff as she was doing the dishes? (After the breakfast line.) I mean, I don’t know, I heard her saying something but I had my earbuds in and wasn’t really paying attention to her, so I suppose I can’t assume. After the dishes, I kept hearing her make smart remarks directed towards me, and in my head I was like, “Ok, that’s it. I guess I should go speak with HR about this.” I mean, after so long, you just get sick of it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like causing trouble or going to HR as is, but this had been going on for long enough and I had hit my limit with it.

Alright so, T is the HR manager. When I got into T’s office, I explained to her everything that has been going on so far. T is already aware of H’s previous behavior, and I feel like she did truly believe me thankfully. She asked me if I felt like it was harassment, and quite honestly, I feel like yeah, that definitely qualifies as harassment, and I told her that. Anyways, she told me that she was going to talk to my boss, C, and it would be taken care of. She also told me that if it gets worse to come back and let her know. Well, not long after I talked with T, C comes in the kitchen and she is pissed. C tells us all to listen up, so we all stopped what we were doing to hear what she had to say. Here’s what was said by C: “Alright, I’ve had it up to here with yal’. I’ve been nice and let you do things, but if this is how it’s gonna be, shit’s gonna change real fast. I just got my ass chewed out and I’m tired of it. There will be no muttering things under your breath, no smart mouthing, and no attitudes or you can walk out the door. Any questions?” We unanimously replied with “No ma’am.” When she walked out the door, she gave me a thumbs up. Honestly, I feel like the situation wasn’t handled properly whatsoever, because I feel like it was treated like it was a group problem, not an H problem. It also felt like it was something that she just wanted to quickly address instead of actually trying to solve the problem in the long run. This also probably made the whole H situation worse.

I think that’s the case because the lunch line is when things took a turn. I was antsy and felt like preoccupying myself with drumming my knuckles on the tray line. My two coworkers, M and C (Not my boss, different C.), didn’t even notice the tapping whatsoever. H on the other hand, was NOT happy about it. The first thing she said was, “oh my god that’s so annoying.” However, I just ignored her like I typically do. She was just trying to nitpick everything I was doing. The next thing she said though was, “can you please stop that?”. After all you do, you’re gonna have the audacity to ask me to stop? I just said, “Oh, no thanks. I’m alright.” She did not like that. Her response was, “If you keep doing that, you can do this all by yourself.” I said, “Ok.” She left, and M looked so lost. I told him not to worry about it, that she was just being childish, and I started to do the line by myself which isn’t that hard. Anyways, a couple of minutes later, she comes back from wherever she went, and she says, “I’ll be seeing you in HR.” or something like that. (It was definitely about us going to HR.) I’m aware that my response probably will likely get me in trouble, but honestly I don’t really care. This whole thing will probably have me in trouble. I replied with, “I really don’t give a fuck.” I was honestly just done with her at that point. She said something about it again and I was like, “All you ever do is bitch and complain about everything and you’ve always got something smart to say to me.” I feel like she was trying to really upset me at this point, but she goes, “No I don’t.” I know I really shouldn’t have indulged in her rage-baiting, but it was really starting to get to me. I said, “Yes you do, and you also like to say shit under your breath that you think no one hears, and you’re always being a dick.” Right description, wrong words I suppose. I tend to let my mouth get the best of me, and that is something I need to work on. Her response baffles me though… “No I don’t, I say shit all the time! If I wanted to say something, I would say it to your face.”

…

How absolutely ironic, right? First of all, she had the audacity to call what I was doing annoying? Remember what I said earlier about H, and how she’s always making sounds? Again, I’ve never made an issue out of it, but COME ON! You can’t say what I’M doing is annoying when you constantly make noises throughout the day which definitely are more annoying than some finger drumming. Secondly, you say shit all the time? What kind of excuse even is that? I don’t even think she knows what she’s talking about. And lastly, she would say it to my face? Ironic how every single time she’s ever said something, it was facing away from me. So, I just replied with, “Yeah, sure.” Then she pulled the classic imitation move and mocked me. “Yeah, sure.” I just ignored literally everything she said after that point and tuned it out.

Here’s the crazy part though: Usually she sits only two trays down on the line at a time because that’s the way I’ve done it from the start and that’s the way I prefer it. Well, I guess since she was mad at me, she suddenly tried to push a third tray onto the table. The thing is, I had my left hand on the left side of one of the trays, and I could feel her start to push the tray, so I started pushing a little to keep the tray in place. She just kept pushing it so I said, “Bruh what are you doing?!” She says, “I’m trying to put down this third tray.” Ok, so this whole time you’ve done two trays, but all of a sudden you decide to do 3? That just doesn’t make sense. I replied to her with, “well stop shoving it!” Of course, she has to have the last word, so she goes, “You’re the only person who doesn’t do that, so.” Again, I ignored her.

After that whole thing, and after we did the dishes, me and C (Again, not my boss C, my coworker/friend C.) just started talking with each other after we finished everything we had to do until the dinner line started.

Really quick tidbit, C (19) is a friend of mine who I met at this job. I’ve always really got along with C. He’s really cool and I feel like we’ve grown really close. Anyways, now H can’t stand the fact that we’re this close because H also likes C. This probably fueled her anger and made her more upset with me.

Anyways, this is the main thing I’d like to talk about. During the dinner line, I was silently tapping my fingers this time so H wouldn’t be so upset lol. Turns out, she thinks I was doing it intentionally to piss her off, so she was still upset about it anyways. That really wasn’t my original intent, because like I said before, I had been feeling antsy that day, but when I figured out she was getting aggravated about it, I still didn’t really care. Anyways, she pulls out her phone during an intermission when M was cutting meatloaf for the line, and says this into her phone: “Yeah, they’ll get over it though.” I believe she was most likely referring to me, and I guess she was using voice to text to message somebody and specifically wanted me to hear that. Anyways, more time passes, and M is cutting more meatloaf. H pulls her phone out again, and what she says next still baffles me. She goes, “Yeah, I bet you could kick his ass. Yeah, I said it, you could kick his ass.” I thought to myself, “Is that supposed to be a threat?” but in the end, I decided not to say anything because I figured she was still trying to get a reaction out of me. Plus, I technically couldn’t prove it was about me. Finally, M is cutting the last batch of meatloaf, and H pulls her phone out for the final time. Lastly, she goes, “Yeah, some people just never grow up.” You know, I believe she has to be one of the biggest hypocrites I’ve ever met. Me… I never grow up? Come on now… I still didn’t say anything though.

After the dinner line, I went to take something upstairs. I guess H thought I had disappeared or something, because when I came back in I heard her say something about that, even though I wasn’t even gone that long. Then, the phone started ringing. Out of the corner of my eye, I did actually see her going for it this time, but when I beat her to it, picked it up and answered it, she goes, “Uh, ok. Well if you answer it you can deal with it.” Again, I ignored her and took the request on the phone. See though? It’s literally just every little thing she’s saying these smart remarks to.

Now this next thing I could also use some advice on. Remember how earlier I said H told me she used to be on different drugs/substances? Well, she told me that she does still smoke w\*\*d. She has also offered to me before to hit her w\*\*d pens that she’s brought to work on a couple of different occasions. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m 21 and I do enjoy smoking w\*\*d. Actually, I myself take a w\*\*d pen to work, which I do acknowledge could get me in trouble. Honestly, I gotta have something for my nerves, especially working 12 hour days, so I’m ok with taking the risk. Plus, most people just think it’s a regular ol’ vape anyways. Well, H has seen me outside hitting these pens before, and since she smokes w\*\*d pens too, she obviously knows what they look like. I figured her knowing wouldn’t be a big deal, but now I’m thinking it could be a problem. On this night, after everything I just said, I was walking outside to hit my pen. Of course, H had something to say about it. I heard her say, “They’re going to know about you smoking w\*\*d outside too.” At first, I thought nothing of it just like everything else she’s said, but the more I’ve thought about it, the more I have sort of worried about it. I really could get in trouble for that, or worse. I really can’t be fired because unfortunately I’m unable to drive myself right now, and I have to help my mom pay for our apartment rent and other things of course. My mom is also my only ride to work, but luckily, we’re on the same rotation and we both work the same time, 7-7, and I basically just carpool with her. Anyways, does anyone have any advice on what I can do to not get in trouble in case she does mention something to HR? Could I just lie and say it’s a regular old nicotine vape? I could even carry a decoy nicotine vape and put it in my locker just to really sell it. I couldn’t lie though and say I don’t vape at all because several people have seen me vape, and I’m sure I’ve been seen vaping on the cameras outside, so that’s out of the picture. It should also be noted that literally the only other person who knows I have that pen is my coworker C and I definitely don’t think he would rat me out. One thing I think I’m definitely going to do is keep my pen in my mom’s car from now on instead of keeping it on me just incase. If there’s anything better I can do, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Now it’s the end of the night. H is over at the cork board looking at the schedule. When she saw it was going to be me, her, and M this Monday and Tuesday, I heard her say, “Well, I guess it’ll only be two people that day because I refuse to work with him.” I just thought to myself, “Well good because I don’t want you here anyways.” I don’t think you can just choose who you get to work with. That’s not how that works. Trust me, if I could, I definitely wouldn’t choose to work with her either. Anyways, she left as early as she possibly could like she does every night, and that was the end of that. Me and C discussed how absolutely crazy the whole situation was after we knew she was gone. Then we finished doing the dishes and he and I clocked out for the night.

Needless to say, I’m astonished by the behavior of H. I think she is being very immature and trying her absolute hardest to upset me and get me in trouble. What can I do about this whole situation? It’s stressing me out and I do not want to quit this job or lose this job. I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",1,1771123492.0,WorkAdvice,3,1.0,False
1r53cgs,https://i.redd.it/bwd5bc5dnkjg1.jpeg,Home Composting Question,"I have been using coffee containers to compost for nearly all my adult life, and this method works, but due to a few factors I will describe, I wanted to ask about easier methods.

I currently use 2  2-LB containers to hold my food left over till I have time to dump them in the area of my property I've set up for composting. I put essentially anything in there that fits, from egg shells, to pineapple skins, and fish guts, with the only limitation being the size. 

The issues I'm having is that I need to empty these out every 3-4 days on average, but when family is around that increases to sometimes twice a day and I'm hoping to find an easier answer. Another issue, is the difficulty washing the coffee container.

My current idea is to get a 5 gallon or similar size bucket, with an easily removable life, but one issue I tend to have is that lids either are too much of a hassle to take off or they are really insecure and some of the stink gets through (and they do get stinky). The coffee container lids do a good job at keeping the stink contained, and to me that is a base line any method needs to beat.

To work with the lid issue, as all 5-gallons have hard to remove lids, I would use a product similar to what is noted below. I'm hoping someone has run into a similar issue or situation, or may have a better idea.

lid: https://a.co/d/02VEwrcN

I’ve always been a lucid dreamer, but it didn’t start as a gift. It started as an escape.

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn’t just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That’s when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn’t exist, where I wasn’t an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn’t had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn’t enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

Early mornings, strong coffee, books that make me think, music that jumps decades without apology. I cook. I read whole author catalogs. I value quiet. I guard my sleep like it’s sacred (because it is).

My kids are grown. I’m not starting over with little ones, but I absolutely value family and connection. Peace matters to me now more than intensity ever did.

I’m drawn to men who are steady, emotionally intelligent, and comfortable in their own skin. The kind of man who can have a thoughtful conversation, laugh easily, and doesn’t need chaos to feel alive.

I appreciate:  
 • accountability  
 • consistency  
 • clear communication  
 • someone who respects boundaries without taking them personally  
 • small, steady effort over grand declarations

I don’t need rescuing. I don’t want drama. I don’t want to argue about sports or be convinced I’ll “come around” to things I’ve already decided aren’t for me.

What does catch my attention?  
 A man who can show up calmly.  
 Who enhances my life instead of complicating it.  
 Who understands that trust is built slowly and that real connection unfolds over time.

Local is ideal. Open to nearby if there’s intention behind it.

If you’ve learned a few things about yourself by now and you’re ready to build something grounded, tell me what peace looks like in your life.

I love pink and red and chocolate and flowers and quality time and going out, but somehow it’s a disappointment every year. I was shopping for my boyfriend’s gift last night and was just filled with dread walking through the store, I felt a pit in my stomach. I felt like throwing up at the thought of Valentine’s Day.

Our first year together, I was so excited for our first Valentine’s Day. I was about 17, we got eachother good gifts he gave me roses and chocolate and I gave him a rose and a 2 page letter and chocolate, and we were going to go out for dinner together. Shortly before we were going to go out his mom calls him and tells him she got him McDonald’s for valentines dinner. I was so upset and just sat there watching him eat his dinner and then I cried because I was so excited to go together and it was ruined. We still went out and he got me something to eat but idk it was disappointing and I don’t know what his mom was thinking.

The year after that he got me chocolates or something and I got him chocolates and something I don’t remember. He spent an hour and a half playing Fortnite with his friend while I sat and waited, we went to the movies, and i had bought and worn a lingerie set and a new skirt I was really excited about. He didn’t care and went to sleep as soon as we got home. I remember staying all night in bed in the uncomfortable outfit hoping maybe he would wake up at some point and gaf, but by 7 am he didn’t, and I went in the bathroom to stare at myself and cry and wonder what was wrong with me, before changing to pajamas and going to sleep n

The next year was solid we went on a trip to the mountains,  had dinner together, and went on a scenic drive. I liked it it was good

Last year was disappointing too, I don’t think we did anything special that I can recall, I think we went for dinner to a steakhouse that I paid for us with using a giftcard i got for my birthday. I just remember really really hoping I would get flowers. I got him some collectible cards and chocolates and stuff he liked, and he gave me chocolates and a short letter on the back of a receipt. I said thank you and whatnot but deep down I was a little disappointed, and got increasingly upset wondering why I never get flowers, just that one time in our relationship. He always said he thinks they’re a waste of money because they die, but why doesn’t he care what makes me happy? why does it matter what he thinks and not what I do. And regardless, I keep every single bouquet of flowers I’m gifted by anybody and I hang and dry them, and keep them on display for years until they literally fall apart. I appreciate them. I also collect and love houseplants so an orchid or something would be greatly appreciated too? Idk I was upset about that to the point I ended up buying myself some tulips from the grocery store the next day. He said they were pretty and that he considered getting me flowers but didn’t bother. I told him it would be nice. Apparently his best friend even encouraged him to buy me some but he didn’t. Last week I told him how Walmarts selling really pretty pink tulips. $8

This year, we both work today. Me 11-5 him 6-10. I said it’s no big deal we can do something special on Sunday and make the most of today. He said his sister and her bf are coming to visit his parents in town today. He planned on going there all day today and staying late to watch a movie, which upset me because I planned to surprise him with dinner and a movie when he was done work and I assumed even if we don’t have much time today we would still make the most of it. He came on my lunch break and took me for coffee and gave me these paper flowers he made, not real flowers but the effort is sweet I think. He said he will give me the rest of my gift tonight. He was late picking me up from work because he forgot, (he lost the keys to my car somewhere this morning  so he just dropped me off today with his car), then during the hour we had,he left to go to his moms, eat her steak dinner and see his sister. Then he keeps trying to ask me to just come to their house tonight to watch a shitty movie that we’ve already seen with his family. Maybe I’m being unreasonable or ungrateful but watching a bad movie with the inlaws is the last thing I want to do on Valentine’s Day. I planned to cook him steak dinner tonight and we could watch a movie together but maybe I should just let him go be with his family if that’s what he wants. I got him a Lego set he’s been wanting and his favorite chocolate so I hope he likes that. I hope tomorrow’s good too.

I don’t know if I’m being miserable, ungrateful or materialistic or if I’m these are genuinely bad valentines days. Maybe my expectations are too high. Idk it’s breaking my heart thinking about how as a teenager every Valentine’s Day I’d come home to flowers and chocolates my dad surprised me with, and then I go online and see the flowers and lingerie and chocolates and perfume and dinner other girls are getting. am I being unappreciative and making myself miserable or is it valid to feel this way",1,1771122884.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

This is something that should be looked up to, a clear example on how we are progressive and quick to adopt new ideas. Britishers would have done something similar with rubber, coffee and tea plantations, and it is still a prominent basis of our economy to this day.

On bringing these up, u/devallar proposed an analog of that for the modern day, which I would like to talk about. It is on manufacturing batteries for tropical context, and the basis is as follows;

\- We send ilmenite/graphite abroad, and re-import them as batteries

\- batteries are not catered to tropical context

\- huge market for those in Africa and other tropics, which r rapidly developing 

I thought that to be quite ingenious. Not only did he identify a neglected bottleneck that we really have a comparative advantage on, he also found a scaling market to pair it with. Just like gun-tech, this could be the next big thing if it were to be done right.

Not to mention, we have the sun above us at most times, and with perovskite solar panels now becoming a thing, a huge opportunity to augment with energy if the sun is present too. 

There are much more elaborations and adjacent ideas in this thread that I cannot do justice to right now, will try to do so in the comment section in following days.

I also would like to give a shout out to anyone who dares to have visions, no matter how realistic - because visions are the basis for potential futures, and they should not be mocked.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

this isn't some feel good bs. there's actual science behind why we're terrible judges of our own attractiveness. i've gone down rabbit holes reading studies, listening to psychology podcasts, watching interviews with researchers who study human perception. turns out our brains are wired to be hyperaware of our own ""flaws"" while others barely notice them. we stare at ourselves in mirrors analyzing every detail, but other people see us in motion, in context, as a whole person. completely different experience.

here's what actually signals you're more attractive than you realize:

**1. people get weirdly nervous or formal around you at first**

this one surprised me. read about it in ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally studied human behavior for a living, fascinating guy). when someone finds you attractive, they often get more reserved initially. not cold, just careful. they're monitoring their behavior because they don't want to mess up the interaction. you might interpret this as them not liking you, but it's usually the opposite. they're just trying not to look stupid in front of someone they're drawn to.

also notice if people seem to ""warm up"" significantly after the first few interactions. that shift from cautious to relaxed often means they were initially intimidated by you.

**2. strangers are unusually helpful or generous toward you**

people go out of their way. they hold doors longer, offer directions before you ask, give you extra fries, help with heavy bags. you might think you just encounter nice people, but attractive individuals genuinely receive more spontaneous kindness. it's called the ""halo effect"" and it's been studied to death in social psychology.

robert cialdini talks about this in ""Influence"" (absolute classic, won a ton of awards, cited in like every psych program). attractive people are automatically perceived as more trustworthy, competent, and deserving of help. wild but true.

**3. people remember random details about you**

someone brings up that thing you mentioned once three months ago about your favorite coffee order or that band you like. they remember your stories. this happens because attractive people capture more attention, so the details stick better in memory. your brain prioritizes information from people it finds appealing.

**4. you get a weird amount of eye contact, then quick look aways**

not staring (that's different). but you catch people glancing at you repeatedly in public spaces, coffee shops, grocery stores. then when you look back they immediately look away. this is classic attraction behavior. they want to look but don't want to be caught looking. if this happens regularly, yeah, people find you attractive.

**5. your friends joke about you being ""intimidating"" or ""out of their league""**

even as a joke, this tells you something. people don't make these jokes about people they don't perceive as attractive. same with comments like ""you could get anyone"" or ""why are you single"" (annoying question but revealing). they're essentially telling you they see you as more attractive than you see yourself.

**6. people assume you're confident even when you're absolutely not**

this one messed with my head. read about it in research on something called ""self perception theory."" attractive people are often assumed to be confident regardless of their actual internal state. so your anxiety and self doubt aren't as visible as you think. other people see someone who looks put together and assume you feel put together.

there's this researcher named thomas cash who studied body image for decades. his work shows that attractive people often have the same insecurities as everyone else, they just get misread as confident because of how they look.

if you want to go deeper on these patterns but don't have time to read all these psychology books, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google experts that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into personalized audio content. 

You can type in something super specific like ""I want to understand attraction psychology as someone who struggles with self-perception"" and it'll pull from sources like the books mentioned here plus dating psychology research and expert interviews to create a custom learning plan just for you. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you get this virtual coach called Freedia that you can actually talk to mid-episode if something clicks and you want to explore it further. Makes the whole learning process way more natural than just grinding through books.

**7. you get weirdly specific compliments**

not generic stuff like ""you look nice"" but oddly detailed observations. ""your smile reaches your eyes"" or ""you have really elegant hands"" or ""your voice is soothing."" when people are attracted to someone, they notice granular details. they're paying close attention.

**8. people mirror your body language constantly**

mirroring is subconscious rapport building. if you notice people copying your gestures, posture, or speech patterns regularly, they're trying to connect with you. we mirror people we like and find attractive. it's automatic.

**9. you've been told you're ""too picky"" about dating**

this might actually mean you have more options than you realize, so your standards naturally calibrated higher. people with fewer options don't get accused of being picky. they get encouraged to be more selective.

**10. casual touches happen a lot**

arm touches during conversation, shoulder bumps, hair adjustments from friends. appropriate touching increases with attraction. if people find reasons to briefly make physical contact, that's a sign they're comfortable with you in a way that suggests attraction.

look, here's the thing. there's actual research showing we're biased toward seeing our own flaws. something called the ""mere exposure effect"" means we get too familiar with our own faces and start picking them apart. but everyone else just sees you normally, without that hyper critical lens.

if even half these things apply to you, you're probably way more attractive than you think. and attractiveness isn't just physical anyway. it's energy, presence, how you make people feel. the best thing i learned from all this research is that confidence isn't about thinking you're perfect. it's about accepting that your self perception is probably way harsher than reality.

stop letting your brain convince you you're mid when other people clearly don't see you that way.",1,1771122643.0,RelentlessMen,0,1.0,False

1r52wgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1r52wgw/what_to_do_about_mixed_signals/,What to do about mixed signals,"Hey. This is anonymous for good reason so buckle up. I’ve already been judging myself hard but you can’t help who you fall for.

EDIT: TLDR: I was in an on stage relationship that bled into real life and despite the feelings seeming very real outside the show nothing happened for moral reasons and the other party has gone hot and cold (read for examples). It’s complicated by a host of issues including a divorce. Can anyone decipher what is real? END EDIT

I (38F) started working with a guy (45M) a few months ago. We work on stage and the roles required kissing and intimacy. No big deal. That’s our job and we had a professional team. I began experiencing a sense of emotional and physical connection (also normal, that’s what the team is there for, to help everything remain professional).

It got very flirty and I’m pretty sure he and I were both catching feelings. Trouble is, I’m married. Everything was above board physically, but emotionally it was blurry. I told my husband everything at the time. We’ve been married 15 years, although it’s been rocky for a while now. Still, I figured I owed it to him to talk about feelings as they came up so we could manage the situation.

This man and I would go out and grab food at lunch or after work which was partly to help foster a sense of ease and friendship so that the on stage chemistry would be incredible (and it worked). It started out fine, talking about work, then it turned to me listening to his complaints in life, and eventually he began sharing and asking about childhood. We talked about anything and everything, from politics to dating (because he’s single). I even tried to help him with a woman he was into. That fizzled out for him.

As the performances neared, we spent more and more time together. The bartender in the bar we ate in clearly thought we were a couple, one evening I asked him if he knew the guy’s drink order because we were buying rounds and he said “sorry I don’t remember you really should know shouldn’t you?”

There were a few occasions where this man mentioned sex, once as a response to me saying I’d have to wake my husband up when I got home to tell him something we’d just talked about and a few times an implied flirtation. Once, he said about the context of the scene work “it’s not like we are really going to fuck”. I ignored the comments at the time but they got me thinking.

We definitely had an energy of tiptoeing around each other because one or two times when we physically bumped into each other or brushed hands to arms outside rehearsal (all accidental) I certainly felt sparks and I heard him sort of giggle so I’m sure he did too.

Meanwhile my husband and I were struggling with fertility issues, and I was in the process of being tested throughout rehearsals. On our opening night we got the news that my husband couldn’t have kids. That brought up a conversation we’d had five years ago around kids and me saying I’d leave if we didn’t try to have them. So it felt like a huge shock.

That same night, after the opening we went out with the producer and her friend and the cast (husband was at home). At a certain point I almost missed the end of public transport and panicked and we all decided to leave and the producer and her friend sympathised because they weren’t sure they could check in for their hotel. This man said (looking at me) that he had a pull out sofa. I said “I should go home.” We left. I did kiss his cheek when I said goodbye. I texted him explaining it was a bad idea and he replied saying he hoped I’d had a fun night and I’d have to leave earlier in the future and what a pain that was. Basically still flirtatious. I flirted back. (Please don’t judge, I still went home although I didn’t want to face our terrible news and I told my husband what had happened too).

The next day this man said he’d had a really fun night that night. We went out with a friend of his after the show. We walked her to her hotel and I set off and he thanked me for hanging around and getting to know his friend because lots of people didn’t seem to. And then he said he’d thought she had a crush on him but he didn’t mind because she’d never overstepped (she doesn’t I’m fairly certain because we actually got along and are friends).

The following week was the end of the show. We went out with some of my friends the night before the last night and he then told me he could have hung out with them forever. There was intense eye contact that evening. Then it was the last night and we went out as a company. He stayed longer than he wanted to although another girl who had seen the show was also flirting with him but he left after we finally got some time alone to chat. I asked him what he was looking for in a partner, he answered honestly I think and vague enough that it could have applied to me but I wouldn’t necessarily know (I need to like their mind, I need to match energy and compatibility, I need to find them attractive). Or it could have been honest. But he was attentive to me. Throughout the show he’d remember details about my coffee order or get cakes he knew I’d like etc.

About three days after the show ended he suddenly was busy with other things and didn’t text so often (first days then weeks would pass). But when he did the tone was still slightly flirtatious and messages were long, asking me about my life and replying to my questions about his etc. I had invited him to two different events and he hadn’t turned up but he had cancelled. And I had mentioned him something during the show which he hasn’t yet returned.

Meanwhile I did inner work to be sure that the crush (because that’s all I have proof it was so far) wasn’t coming from just the character—the truth is the person I fell for was the person I spoke to after work. But then after a month of this I asked him what might have happened if I’d gone to his and when he didn’t answer after a week, I said sorry but I think we both knew the answer and I couldn’t be his friend because I needed to focus on my marriage and I told him the truth about the fertility. When he didn’t really I sent a few messages about getting my things back saying he could ghost me later after returning them. And on my birthday he didn’t say happy birthday and I sent him a voice note saying that was upsetting. Although I acknowledged my own mixed signals. Then I pushed for the items one last time.

He replied a month after my message to say that he was sorry to hear our news, that therapy would help and he couldn’t give advice (I hadn’t asked for advice—I told him in case he had a vested interest) and he wished us the best and that he was uncomfortable and didn’t recall inviting me to his place under those circumstances. But it was distant and very formal. And he said he’d leave my things with a mutual friend. And I was full of shame that I’d participated and regret that we hadn’t gone further (feelings are complicated) and I felt so rejected that he didn’t choose me that time. So I sent a goodbye voice note confessing my reasons for saying we couldn’t be friends which had nothing to do with me caring for him or not and in fact were because I had feelings for him. I also said all the things I liked about him or a lot of those. And I apologised for making him uncomfortable by coming on to him so I tried to tone it down and assure him that I just wanted to be friends.

I then went on a work trip and while I was gone I also visited family. I reflected on my marriage and asked my husband if we could separate because I hadn’t missed him while I’d been gone and my brother’s kids made me think about having my own actual kids and I know it’s cold when we’ve been married so long but it was one of the first things we’d ever talked about and then I waited years and years before we even tried. So the marriage seemed like it should have ended before all this but that’s hard because it means starting over and I have little resources to do that. Plus I’m running out of time for a family.

Important to say that this man kept saying how much he wanted kids and was worried it was too late for him to find that since he thought he’d had love twice and lost it.

He still hasn’t arranged the return of my things but he did start that process by asking the director of our show if he could return them to them.

I sent a message thanking him for starting that process and also telling him about my separation. Which is a pretty clear signal although it’s conflicting with what I said before. But I’m also responding to his mixed signals and the distance he suddenly created.

I can understand that if he had feelings he might not want to get into a situation this messy, but also it’s possible he was stringing me along or wanted to be friends.

And then also I was nominated for something relating to the show (a local award) and I shared it in our company chat—where he hasn’t responded to anyone and where not everyone bothered to respond or was obligated to. He congratulated me there. This was before I’d sent the message thanking him for arranging things which was a little incongruous.

I guess I’m trying to understand why he took a month to say I had the wrong impression if I really did have the wrong impression. And then why he congratulated me but didn’t reply when I asked if he wanted to be friends again.

Do people agree he likely had feelings? That he’s repressing them? I think because his past involves these issues and he wouldn’t do that to someone? Am I delusional?  Is it too late? Does he maybe still have them? It’s been months now, he could have moved on—he’s a single guy who is very attractive. I’d also be okay to just sleep together as long as it happens after I’m not married anymore. I don’t want to do that to my husband or anyone really. (The husband and I discussed trying to stay friends when we divorce too, because we went through a lot of trauma together and care for each other—and he’s very sad but I’m just not happy in the relationship and I want kids with a partner who are mine at least at the moment and he understands that but also I think some of what we went through has trauma bonded us and I don’t meet his needs either and I think we will both thrive separately so it’s so far amicable even though it’s only at separation stage). I’m not sure about the idea of jumping right into something the moment I get divorced (and currently we’re only separating anyway so it has to wait) but the spark was awesome. I’ve never felt as seen and understood as when we were talking. (My husband never saw me that way, this is part of how the attraction developed and part of why I think it’s separate to character). And the other complication is I told him we couldn’t be friends and immediately regretted that because I miss him…but I suppose if I want to sleep with him we can’t exactly be friends—FWB is cool but I don’t think that’s on the cards.

I should also say that I’m attractive but I’m overweight and that’s partly because of the role (I’ve actually lost about 25 pounds since the show, although I’m not slender—and I don’t mind my size I do okay with my job because I hit a niche but his exes were dancer types). So if he is attracted it’s not because I’m his type.

Whew, if you made it this far thank you. I know some people will judge me but I beg you to remember I’ve tried to be above board or at least honest at every point, I did flirt but the emotional connection came about because of the job (it’s very vulnerable to be an actor and these types of emotional bonds are turned with everyone in a cast and we can usually get over everyone leaving at the end). And it was part of the work to do that and build chemistry, although I admittedly allowed it to permeate beyond the job but I tried to stave that off. It’s so normal for co-stars to fall for each other, it rarely lasts, it’s called a showmance, but this didn’t feel like that to me. Can’t speak for the guy because despite me asking to meet up and chat he’s never wanted to. All help appreciated.",2,1771122145.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are seriously considering relocating to Long Beach after 20 years in Santa Barbara. I moved to SB at 18 for UCSB and have built my adult life here, so this feels like a big shift.

We’re an almost 40, Black professional family with a curious toddler. We value:

	•	Diversity, especially a strong Black community

	•	Good public schools

	•	Walkability to coffee, food, parks

	•	Quiet, residential feel

	•	A sense of pride in the neighborhood

We’ve been looking heavily at Bixby Knolls, and on paper it checks a lot of boxes. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous. Santa Barbara has a certain aesthetic and demographic consistency. Part of me wonders if we should look for something that mirrors that more closely and just travel intentionally for culture, instead of embedding ourselves in something more urban and mixed.

For those who know both areas, what neighborhoods would you recommend for a family like ours?

If you had to name your top 3 Long Beach neighborhoods for:

	•	Black professional family

	•	Toddler-friendly

	•	Community-oriented

	•	Somewhat polished but not sterile

What would they be and why?
