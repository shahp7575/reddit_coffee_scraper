My treatment caused so much gum receding after Ortho moved my teeth forward, that I now have five black triangles at front top teeth. While cosmetically I’ve accepted my smile looks worse now, I am finding hard to live with the food getting stuck in them, esp in professional/social eating situations. It’s embarrassing and food won’t move without floss. 

I got first sole black triangle in Feb at end of first treatment, so in March Ortho said do refinements to close it up… but those refinements led to four new black triangles instead and didn’t fix first one. The latest second refinements then made them worse. The excessive gum receding also caused top of my gums to now catch food- where a tooth curve is that my gums used to cover. 

Since Ortho seems to not really fix this issue I wonder how people live with it with dignity.

The Wi-Fi was primed, the swag bags were tight,  
And Slack was on Do Not Disturb for the night.

I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,  
Tripped over my charger and made quite a crash.

The moon on the glow of the code-fueled night  
Gave the luster of open source — shining bright.

I knew in a moment it must be LlamaFarm.

On bashers and hackers — the keynote’s at nine!

Their sunglasses gleamed in the cool Raleigh air.

I recently had the opportunity to try out a test roast on a few different roasters: Gene Cafe, Behmor 2000ab, and a Fresh Roast Sr800 with extension tube. The Gene Cafe went a darker than the manual suggested, the Behmor came out lighter than anticipated and the SR800 was just a bit inconsistent.  

Are these experiences typical until you hit a more consistent rhythm?
Are these still the primary roasters to look at in the <$700 ballpark? I saw posts from 3+ years ago looking at these roasters.
Are there coffee varieties to avoid as a home roaster (either can't extract much flavor or just tricky to nail)? 

I've seen the Ikawa, and generic brand roasters (like this one on Amazon https://a.co/d/76FZ6iU - not affiliated), but haven't spent too much time looking into them. 

Given that I prefer light (cinnamon/city) to a full city (or at darkest, a full city plus) roast, and would prefer to be able to roast at least 8oz / 250g, at a time, what's your favorite or recommended roaster and why?

Saying goodbye again was tough (as always), but this trip reminded us that we’re still us. Strong, patient, and more in love than ever. The distance didn’t weaken anything — it deepened what we already had.

I chose **Ankole**, a kingdom historically known for its rich cattle pastures. What really caught my attention was that **Lacustrine Bantu** is a primary culture, which allows colonizing large parts of East Africa without needing to research *Quinine*—a huge strategic advantage.

The early game was fairly straightforward. I managed to **reform out of Traditionalism surprisingly quickly**, and also picked up **Cultural Exclusion** early on (though I kept the state religion for the entire game).

One of the early highlights was my **war with Portugal in the 1850s**. By then, I had developed a domestic arms industry and fielded well-trained **line infantry**. I was able to **subdue Zanzibar and the Swahili city-states**, and even kicked **Portugal out of East Africa**, which was immensely satisfying.

**Egypt**, however, was a different beast. They crushed me in the **1880s**, and by **1900** we were locked in a brutal slog. I eventually won that war, but it was **a costly and exhausting campaign**.

I stayed independent as long as I could, but after my defeat by Egypt, **a newly unified Germany** launched a war in the late 1880s to make me its **protectorate**. Rather than risk losing territory, I gave in. Ironically, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise: German investment surged my economy from around **£40 million to £180 million** in just a few years, and access to their market supercharged my exports.

In **1910**, Germany dragged me into **World War I**. It was **Germany + France + Hungary** vs **USA + UK**. While we dominated Africa, we lost in the Americas and couldn’t gain ground in Europe or Asia. The war ended in a **white peace stalemate**, but during the conflict, **Ankole was finally recognized by the great powers** and shed its secondary power status.

After the war, I began pushing for **independence from Germany**. Thankfully, a coalition of **USA, UK, Russia, the Federation of the Andes, Hungary, Brazil, Italy, and Spain** backed my play. Germany folded without a shot being fired.

By **1915**, I launched a third war against Egypt and **annexed Sudan**. Around this time, I finally became a **recognized great power**, reaching **6th place** in the global rankings. Still, I didn’t feel confident going toe-to-toe with anyone above me—but a strong alliance network kept **Ankole sovereign and secure**. 

I stayed a **Monarchy** until the **1920s** when socialist revolutions rocked Ankole and forced a **Council Republic** transforming the empire into a (in theory) socialist state. Subsequent reforms however, largely stalled and the capitalist and land owning classes remained entrenched. 

All in all, it was a **really fun and rewarding run**. I highly recommend trying Ankole. That said, the **lack of sulphur and lead in East Africa** does limit industrial potential somewhat, so you'll need to adapt.",2,1760323586.0,victoria3,1,1.0,False

# Top Dark Roast Coffee Countries

**Dark roast coffee** has a rich, bold flavor that many coffee lovers crave. The roasting process changes the beans’ taste, creating a smoky and strong cup. Different countries have unique styles and traditions for dark roast coffee. Some have perfected the art, making their coffee stand out worldwide. This section explores the top countries known for their [dark roast coffee](https://gomehedi.com/best-dark-roast-coffee/) and what makes their brews special.

# Italy

**Italy** is famous for its espresso culture. Italian dark roast coffee is strong, with a deep, intense flavor. The beans are roasted until dark brown or almost black. This style brings out a slightly bitter, smoky taste that pairs well with milk-based drinks like cappuccinos. Italian coffee brands like Lavazza and Illy are known globally for their dark roasts.

# France

**French dark roast** coffee has a smooth, caramelized flavor. The roasting is often longer, creating a dark, oily bean surface. French roast coffee is bold but less bitter than Italian roast. It has notes of chocolate and toasted nuts. This style suits drip coffee makers and French press brewing.

# United States

The **United States** has diverse dark roast styles. Cities like Seattle and Portland lead in craft coffee roasting. American dark roasts range from slightly smoky to very bold and oily beans. Brands like Starbucks popularized the dark roast with a rich, intense profile. Many roasters experiment with flavors and bean origins.

# Colombia

**Colombian coffee** is mostly light to medium roast, but dark roast versions are gaining popularity. Dark roasted Colombian beans keep some of their fruity and nutty notes. The dark roast here is smoother and less bitter than many other dark roasts. It offers a balanced cup with a rich aroma.

# Indonesia

**Indonesia** produces dark roasts with earthy and spicy flavors. Sumatra coffee is the most famous dark roast from this region. It has a full body, low acidity, and a deep, bold taste. Indonesian dark roasts often show notes of chocolate, tobacco, and herbs.

|Country|Flavor Profile|Popular Roast Style|Famous Brands/Regions|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Italy|Strong, smoky, slightly bitter|Espresso dark roast|Lavazza, Illy|
|France|Bold, caramelized, smooth|French roast|Various artisan roasters|
|United States|Rich, intense, smoky|Craft dark roasts|Starbucks, Seattle roasters|
|Colombia|Balanced, fruity, smooth|Dark roast versions|Various coffee farms|
|Indonesia|Earthy, spicy, full-bodied|Sumatra dark roast|Sumatra region|

# Characteristics Of Dark Roast Coffee

**Dark roast coffee** stands out for its bold taste and deep color. It undergoes a longer roasting process than lighter roasts. This process changes the beans’ flavors and aroma significantly. The beans appear dark brown or almost black with an oily surface. Dark roasts often have less acidity and a heavier body. These traits make them popular worldwide, especially in countries that favor strong coffee. Understanding the characteristics of dark roast coffee helps identify which country produces the best version.

# Flavor Profiles

Dark roast coffee offers a unique flavor profile. The long roasting time reduces the original bean flavors. Instead, it highlights smoky, bitter, and sometimes sweet notes. The acidity is low, making the taste smoother but more intense.

* **Bitterness:** Dark roast has a strong, bitter taste due to caramelized sugars.
* **Smoky notes:** Roasting causes a smoky aroma, often described as burnt or charred.
* **Chocolate and caramel:** Some dark roasts reveal hints of dark chocolate or caramel.
* **Low acidity:** The acid content is reduced, making it less sharp than lighter roasts.

The table below shows the main differences between dark and light roast flavors:

|Flavor Aspect|Dark Roast|Light Roast|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Acidity|Low|High|
|Bitterness|High|Low|
|Body|Heavy|Light|
|Aroma|Smoky, roasted|Fruity, floral|

# Roasting Techniques

Dark roast coffee requires careful roasting techniques. The beans are heated at higher temperatures and for longer times than lighter roasts. This process affects the chemical makeup and physical appearance of the beans.

Key steps include:

1. **High temperature:** Roasting usually happens between 230°C and 250°C (446°F to 482°F).
2. **Longer duration:** The beans roast until the second crack, a stage where the beans crack audibly.
3. **Cooling:** After roasting, beans cool quickly to stop the process.

There are two main roasting methods:

* **Drum roasting:** Beans rotate inside a drum heated by gas or electricity. This method ensures even roasting.
* **Hot air roasting:** Hot air flows through the beans, roasting them quickly and evenly.

The roasting profile greatly influences the final taste. Dark roasts from different countries may vary depending on the exact technique and temperature used.

# Italy’s Dark Roast Tradition

**Italy’s Dark Roast Tradition** stands as a pillar in the world of coffee. The country is famous for its rich, bold, and deeply roasted coffee beans. Italian dark roast is not just a flavor; it is a cultural experience. Roasting coffee beans to a dark level brings out intense aromas and a slightly bitter taste. Italians have perfected this method over centuries, creating a unique coffee style loved worldwide.

The dark roast in Italy often means a deep caramelization of sugars in the bean, resulting in a thicker body and a smoky, sometimes chocolatey flavor. This tradition is deeply tied to the Italian way of life, especially in how coffee is prepared and enjoyed daily.

# Espresso Culture

Espresso is the heart of Italy’s coffee culture. It uses a dark roast to create a strong, concentrated shot of coffee. This small cup of coffee packs a punch. Italians drink espresso many times a day, often standing at a coffee bar.

Key points about Italian espresso culture:

* **Short and strong:** Espresso shots are usually 25-30 ml.
* **Fast consumption:** Italians drink espresso quickly, often in one or two sips.
* **Social ritual:** Coffee bars are social hubs, places to meet and chat.
* **Quality focus:** High-quality dark roast beans are essential for true espresso.

The espresso brewing process highlights the dark roast’s boldness. The high pressure extracts rich oils and flavors from the coffee. The crema, a golden foam on top, shows a well-made espresso. This tradition influences how Italians enjoy coffee daily and inspires coffee lovers globally.

# Famous Italian Brands

Italy hosts many famous coffee brands known for dark roast excellence. These brands have shaped how people worldwide perceive Italian coffee. They offer blends crafted from carefully roasted beans. Each brand has its unique flavor profile but shares the dark roast tradition.

Here is a table of some well-known Italian coffee brands:

# Regional Preferences

Dark roast preferences vary widely across U.S. regions. Each area has its own taste and coffee culture. These differences reflect local history, climate, and lifestyle.

In the West Coast, coffee lovers prefer roasts that highlight bold, smoky flavors. Seattle and Portland are famous for their deep, rich dark roasts. The coffee here often has chocolate and caramel notes.

|South|Mild dark|Smooth, comforting|

Understanding these regional preferences helps explain the diversity of dark roast coffee in the U.S. The variety offers options for all dark roast lovers.

# Comparing Coffee Quality And Taste

Choosing the best dark roast coffee involves more than just picking a country. The quality and taste depend on several factors. Comparing these elements helps find which country really stands out in dark roast coffee. Two key points to examine are the bean origin and roasting consistency. Both strongly affect the final flavor and aroma of the coffee.

# Bean Origin Impact

The origin of coffee beans plays a big role in the taste of dark roast coffee. Different countries grow beans in unique climates and soils. These conditions create distinct flavors before roasting.

**Key factors from bean origin:**

* **Climate:** Warmer and wetter regions produce beans with more acidity and fruit notes.
* **Soil:** Rich volcanic soil adds complexity to the flavor.
* **Altitude:** Higher altitudes yield denser beans with sharper taste.
* **Varietal:** Different coffee plant types bring unique flavor profiles.

For example, Colombian beans often have a smooth and balanced flavor. Ethiopian beans show bright fruity and floral notes. Indonesian beans usually have earthy and bold flavors.

|Country|Typical Bean Flavor|Common Growing Conditions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Colombia|Smooth, nutty, mild acidity|High altitude, volcanic soil|
|Ethiopia|Fruity, floral, bright|High altitude, varied microclimates|
|Indonesia|Earthy, bold, low acidity|Low altitude, humid tropical|

Dark roasting reduces some origin flavors but does not erase them. The natural bean qualities still influence the taste. The best dark roast coffee beans come from countries with rich, well-grown beans. These beans handle the intense roasting without losing flavor.

# Roasting Consistency

Roasting consistency is crucial for high-quality dark roast coffee. The roast level must be even across all beans for a smooth taste. Uneven roasting can cause bitterness or burnt flavors.

**Important aspects of roasting consistency:**

1. **Temperature control:** Maintaining steady heat ensures uniform roast.
2. **Roasting time:** Proper time avoids under or over-roasting.
3. **Batch size:** Keeping batch sizes constant helps control roast quality.
4. **Cooling process:** Quickly cooling beans stops roasting at the right point.

Professional roasters use machines that monitor and adjust heat automatically. This technology improves consistency and repeatability. Small variations can change the coffee’s taste drastically, especially in dark roasts.

The table below shows common roast levels and their effects on flavor:

|Roast Level|Temperature Range|Flavor Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Light Roast|356-401°F (180-205°C)|Bright, acidic, fruity|
|Medium Roast|410-428°F (210-220°C)|Balanced, sweet, nutty|
|Dark Roast|437-482°F (225-250°C)|Bold, smoky, bitter|

**Consistent roasting** helps dark roast coffee keep its rich flavor without becoming too bitter or burnt. Countries with advanced roasting methods often produce better dark roast coffee. This factor is just as important as bean origin in determining the best dark roast.

# Consumer Preferences And Trends

Dark roast coffee has a strong and bold flavor that many coffee lovers enjoy worldwide. Different countries offer unique styles of dark roast coffee, shaped by local tastes and traditions. Understanding **consumer preferences and trends** helps reveal which country might lead in producing the best dark roast. This section explores how people across the globe enjoy dark roast coffee and what health factors influence their choices.

# Global Popularity

Dark roast coffee is popular in many countries, especially where people prefer a rich and intense flavor. Countries like Italy, France, and the United States have strong coffee cultures that favor darker roasts. For example, Italian espresso is known for its deep, smoky taste, while French roast is famous for its bold and slightly bitter notes.

Here are some key points about the global popularity of dark roast coffee:

* **Italy:** Known for espresso, Italians enjoy dark roast for its strong flavor and creamy texture.
* **France:** French roast is darker and oilier, popular in cafes and homes alike.
* **United States:** Dark roasts are common in specialty coffee shops and among home brewers.
* **Scandinavia:** While light roast is more popular, some consumers prefer dark roast for its boldness.

The table below shows popular dark roast styles by country:

|Country|Popular Dark Roast Style|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Italy|Espresso|Strong, rich, smoky|
|France|French Roast|Bold, bitter, oily|
|United States|Dark Roast Blend|Robust, full-bodied, chocolatey|
|Brazil|Brazilian Dark Roast|Nutty, sweet, smooth|

Dark roast coffee often appeals to those who want a strong caffeine kick and a bold taste. Preferences vary, but the trend shows a steady interest in dark roast styles globally. Many consumers enjoy experimenting with different roasts to find their perfect cup.

# Health Considerations

Health concerns play a role in choosing dark roast coffee. Dark roasts contain less caffeine than light roasts because the roasting process burns some caffeine away. This can be a benefit for people sensitive to caffeine but who still want a strong coffee flavor.

Dark roast coffee also has fewer acids than lighter roasts. This makes it easier on the stomach and less likely to cause acid reflux or heartburn. People with sensitive stomachs often prefer dark roast for this reason.

Here are some health points related to dark roast coffee:

* **Lower acidity:** Dark roast is gentler on the stomach.
* **Reduced caffeine:** Suitable for those limiting caffeine intake.
* **Antioxidants:** Dark roast contains antioxidants that may support health.
* **Potential risks:** Overconsumption can still cause jitters or sleep problems.

The table below compares caffeine and acidity levels between roast types:

|Roast Type|Caffeine Content|Acidity Level|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Light Roast|High|High|
|Medium Roast|Medium|Medium|
|Dark Roast|Low|Low|

Choosing dark roast coffee often means balancing flavor with health benefits. Many consumers appreciate dark roast for its rich taste and lower acidity. Still, it is important to drink coffee in moderation to avoid negative effects.

1o580rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1o580rx/dnf_first_marathon/,DNF first marathon,"Attempted my first marathon today and I did not finish. I tapped out at mile 22. I'm not exactly crushed but I am a little disappointed that I was only 4.2 miles from the finish line. Thru all of this, Ive determined that I really don't like distance running, so I'm not sure if I'll try again. I might in a year or two though. Surprisingly, no chaffing, though I did use copious amounts of Vaseline.

The marathon was in New England, which is currently being hit by the tropical storm/nor'easter and the race course went along the coast. Race was 8am-2pm, rain started around 10-11am. Temp was 60°F with winds between 10-30 mph. Race was mostly flat but had a few hills, and water/Gatorade every 2 miles. I'd been training ""from couch"" on and off since January this year until I injured my ankles around May that didn't heal until July. Then picked up training again. My plan was to ""walk/run"" the marathon with doing 13 minute miles to try to finish the race under 6 hrs. During my training, I began to strongly dislike any distance past 10k-8miles, but figured I had already paid for it so might as well carry on with the plan. The morning of the race, I got 8 hrs of sleep, woke up two hrs beforehand and had a plain bagel with jam and coffee. The beginning of the race was doing great. The views were beautiful, rain hadn't started yet, and I was fresh and bouncy and meeting my 13 minute mile. Then mile 10 hit and everything went down hill from there. The rain started, I ran thru puddles that got tiny pebbles in my shoes that I couldn't get out, I got slapped in the face by a wave that went over a seawall (tbf, I shouldn't of been that close to it, but I wanted to see the water 😂), I had thermals on but the wind was still making it cold. My fingers were stiff. I wanted to quit but pressed on. By mile 17, I was doing 15-17 minute miles, but I resolved to just finish an hr or so late (3pm, race finished at 2pm). However by 12:30-1pm, they had packed up the aid stations and mile marker flags. It was cold, I hadn't seen another soul for a good while, I was out of water (still had gels that I could've taken), it was pouring, the pebbles in my shoes were causing seering pain the likes of which I've never felt before, and by mile 22(1:30pm), someone from the race drove by to check in and said that in 30 minutes, I'd be completely unsupported and the finish line might not even be there anymore (due to the storm, they were having to pack up early. Initially they wouldve kept it up for a while after the race) and I just called it. 

Anyways, so that was my absolutely miserable experience of a first marathon 😂. I'm aware that these are all excuses for my failure, but at least I tried I guess. I should've just done the half marathon haha. ",1,1760323122.0,firstmarathon,0,1.0,False

Offer rates differ on where u put as your top 1 location. (Ex. if ur top 1 was new york, or california, that would be a lot more competitive that having colombus or plano, note: this isn't talking about the code for good locations, this is for when u first submit the application on JPMC code for good job opening - u choose top 3 locations, the top 3 locations aren't for where u get placed for the hackathon, they are for where u get placed AFTER for the internship - if u get it)

I was at Plano. So far it has been about a week (10/12) since we finished and no offers have been given out to anyone on my team yet, I think they give out offers in batches based off of location and some people got phone calls for there location that they got an offer (10/8) . However, I heard the offer rate is around 5.5 out of 7 people on your team will get an internship offer. The most important thing I noticed was to really be outspoken and make sure you are talking. You will be given a hugeee notepad to write on, I would say the BEST THING TO GET AN OFFER - you should be standing up with a marker in your hand and writing down anything and everything your team talks about, and should be the last person to sit back down when u begin to code, and try to use as many of those notepad pages as possible since people WILL notice you. Whether it be drawing out frontend pages, database architecture, or just brainstorming. This will clearly show ur leadership skills and try to be very friendly and accepting - like prompting other people for their opinion or asking how they would think of this xyz idea. Make sure u talk about useful stuff ( lets meet up every hour to commit and make sure no merge branches, how should we do sleep schedule - does anyone plan on staying up all night, whos good at frontend/backend, maybe we should use these features to match the nonprofits need of xyz)

Team:

Before the event starts, you will be invited to a github repo (probably the day before), with a team number. When u get to the event u will be sitting at a table in the big coding room with your team number waiting for them to arrive. This was completely random team, I didn't fill anything out like are you good at backend/frontend or have I done any hackathons before.

Nonprofits:

Nonprofits randomly assigned to teams after u listen to all of there needs, make sure to take notes of them while they present and come up with some solutions. Then when u get assigned your nonprofit u can present a solution immediately and it looks good on you. Then they will have around an hour of questions that you can ask the nonprofits. A good tip would be if you want to win, make sure u bring a lot of ur team to the questionnaires to really really figure out what u need to build and how u can win. (Winning looks good but doesn't guarantee an offer). The people who don't come to the question can just code or keep planning, but it won't feel as productive when the whole team is there planning/coding.

Food / bevs :

the food was so so so good. Texas bbq galore. It did run out tho so make sure ur not waiting too long to get a bite. They had no energy drinks but they did have coffee all day long.

morning: breakfast desert

lunch: chicken alfredo, asparagus

dinner: bbq chicken, brisket, mac and cheese, bannana pudding

dinner2 (cause they ran out of meat) : pizza

morning2: eggs ,bacon, potatoes

lunch2: paper bag of sandwich and chips and cookie

  
Mentor:

You will have a mentor - probably more than one, these are ur best friends - they were actually really friendly and I really enjoyed talking to mine. Talk to them a lot and make sure to bounce stuff off of them since they are the ones observing you and giving notes about how you performed. You will also likely have a one on one talk with your mentor where they pull u aside, they ask questions like ""what got you into coding"" and really conversational stuff - nothing like an interview at all, its more of just trying to get to know you. I would say if u want to prepare, look up some stuff that JPMC swes do or anything specific to JPMC and try to have some generic answer to tie it into one of your experiences. I talked about my previous experience of what I did at summer and then mostly asking about what he does for work and fun. The mentor might change on your second day of the hackathon.

Besides the mentor there will be other software engineers walking around and u can ask them for help or advice too, obviously focus on asking your mentor but they the software engineers walking around are new grads and might have a better perspective on hackathon related ideas. (For example: One of them gave us the idea to not have a backend - since we were having a really hard time setting it up with the public wifi stuff - and just made mock data and that saves us infinite time and nobody noticed). In the start, you will have a ""networking session"", which is really just like an hour to go around and talk, you should use this time to get to know your team and meet as many JPMC software engineers u can.

Presentation:

After the first day u will probably be close to done to coding. The second day should be ironing everything out and making it presentable, and also practicing your pitch. For a really good presentation, it would only have 2-3 people presenting, try to be one of those people. You can do this by either working on a large part of the code so you know the most about it, or if you are good public speaker - speak up and dont be shy. There are two presentations, one with JPMC employees (lil more technical) and one with the nonprofit. Make sure u speak up to answer their questions if they have any so you are visible. (estimate 1-2 hours of getting ur pitch down - they can tell if u haven't practiced)

Who decides if you get an offer?  
Everybody, you will be getting observed in the presentations, mentors, even the software engineers just walking around. Try not to make any massive f ups - like fighting with ur team or commiting the .env file. U also get judged by ur commits so make sure ur actually writing code. I dont know how much the coding part matters but just try not to have the least amount of commits on your team and focus on being a leader and be as vocal as u can.



Merch:

JPMC code for good shirt

JPMC wind breaker <-- looked very cool but don't think this is gonna be given at every event

JPMC water bottle

First time hackathon?  
I never did hackathon before I got accepted to code for good. But after getting accepted there was around 3 weeks until it happened, in that time I made \~3 MERN full stack apps, by first watching a youtube tutorial , following it. Then making 2 more after with llm assistance. Then I signed up for a hackathon the weekend before, if u do this, just make sure not to overdo it and get your sleep in, and I made sure I looked for random teammates for the hackathon to simulate the event. We did end up doing backend in FastAPI both times for both pratice and Code for good ( we couldnt get it working for code for good so just skipped backend) , so just be open to idea that u might have to pick up something new. (I would even say make a project with FastAPI too)




Other useful tips:  

Attend the zoom workshops they have the week before it and ask questions - u can show face more.

Look for your specific recruiter and introduce yourself.

This was years ago.( over 30 years I guess)
I've just been curious if other families do this sort of thing now.
So , we would go on a caravan holiday( my husband and our two daughters), to a location around an hour and a half drive from home every year .( My husband's parents owned the caravan, but were happy to let us use it for a couple of weeks in the holidays) 
I honestly never really enjoyed caravan holidays ( my husband loves it), just the walking to the showers, toilets,, especially at night was annoying 😑,  give me a motel room any day. ) We went in these holidays for around 20 years when our daughters were growing up..
Anyway the issue was that sometimes..like this occasion, my in-laws would turn up to visit , like one morning,  my husband and I were still in bed,( just half asleep..nothing embarrassing happening ,thank goodness..lol )and, surprise..my MIL , FIL. My husband's Aunt and Uncle come in to visit ( around 8.30 am ), then I have to get up , pretend to be happy to see them, make coffee, offer something to eat, and play host for the rest of the day.

I’ve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn’t matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I’d like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

Let's chat and see where things go. Leave your hesitations and take the chance.",1,1760322646.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I'm that person who majored in Anthropology, never grew out of loving Halloween, and genuinely believes Morticia and Gomez had the healthiest relationship on television. My aesthetic is what I like to call ""Gothic Mrs. Frizzle""—it ebbs and flows depending on my mood. Some days I'm full dark academia with bold jewel tones, other days I'm in yoga pants and a band tee, occasionally I even channel my inner hippie. Versatility is key when you're trying to keep life interesting.

Speaking of interesting: I work for the FAA, which has recently gifted me some unexpected free time to rediscover hobbies and explore new rabbit holes on the internet. So here I am, trying out new things, reconnecting with communities that bring joy, and generally just a gwaan easy through life's current plot twist. ✨

**The Family:**
- **My husband**: Genuinely the cutest human, somehow keeps me sane while also driving me absolutely crazy (it's a gift, really). He's a PS5 enthusiast, anime lover, passionate defender of the first two Star Wars trilogies with an equally passionate hatred of the rest, grill master, and basically a ferret in human form—if it lights up and changes colors, he's obsessed. He loves alt women and supports my gothy shenanigans. 10/10, would marry again. 💚

- **Gaz** (13, f, Basset/Husky): Picture a husky-sized body on basset hound legs. She's a magnificent cryptid creature who is equal parts sweet genius and absolute chaos gremlin. 🐕

- **Bela Lugosi** (almost 20!, f, Calico): My long-haired senior lady who had a stroke but refuses to let it slow her down. She shares food with her doggy sister because she's generous like that. 🐱

- **Sephiroth** (5, m, Tuxedo): The only pet who acts exactly as you'd expect. Loves dry food, does zoomies, chirps at birds, knocks things off counters. Sweet as pie, also kind of a dick. It's the cat way. 🐈‍⬛

**Things I love:** All things macabre and misunderstood (bats, crows, owls are my spirit animals 🦇), procedural crime dramas (they're my comfort genre even when they're objectively bad), most sci-fi, LOTR, Harry Potter, horror/thriller movies, British/Australian/Kiwi TV, Star Trek, Supernatural, kayaking, hiking, bonfires, concerts, and literally any activity that's dog-friendly because Gaz deserves to experience everything.

I'm currently teaching myself AI analysis (gotta stay ahead of the curve), working on preparedness planning, meal prepping on a budget, trying to grow vegetables without killing them immediately, and attempting to learn Spanish, Korean, and Jamaican Patois because apparently I like challenges. I'm also very good at falling into Wikipedia/YouTube black holes at 2 AM. 🌙

If you also believe that things others find creepy are actually beautiful, that pets are family, or that the best way to handle uncertainty is with dark humor and a solid backup plan—let's be friends. 

What's everyone's current comfort show/movie? I need new recommendations to add to my ever-growing watch list! 📺

1o57olt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o57olt,Vegas Recap (10/4/25-10/11/25) with photos,"Went with my wife last week to Vegas and stayed at Westgate in a 2 bedroom suite for free that my buddy hooked me up with. Overall, we had a great time.

Did a bit of planning, show tickets and dinner reservations, a couple of months in advance thanks to a lot of good advice and recs from this thread and wanted to share my experience for future travelers. These are my personal sentiments and please do correct me if something is inaccurate. Sorry for long post :)

**Transportation:**

* From airport to the Strip, taxi is a fixed price based on zone. My destination was zone 3. Taxi $29. Lyft $18. Wife was tired so we went with taxi right outside instead of walking a bit to the rideshare area to the right.
* Lyft is cheaper than Uber. Didn't hail a taxi to avoid being taken for a ride. Bad experience years ago from a NYC cabbie, so we did Lyft quite a bit.
* Zoox is a free robot taxi. Fun. Download the app. We took it from Luxor to Resorts World. However, there was no service on a different date.
* Monorail is somewhat convenient and cost effective from Westgate to stops along the east side of the Strip casinos. Having the e-tickets on iPhone wallet is super convenient. The monorail stations are in the back of the casinos so going to the Cosmopolitan would be getting off at the Horseshoe/Paris and walking from the back of the casino to the front, across the strip diagonally to the Cosmo. All the walking helped burn off calories from all the food we ate lol. *Link to monorail map -->*  [*https://www.lvmonorail.com/route-map/*](https://www.lvmonorail.com/route-map/)

**Shows/Concerts:**

* Air Supply at Westgate - Very good. Brought back great memories of the 80's, the best era in music. Russell Hitchcock can still hit the high notes.
* Shin Lim at Palazzo - Intricate close up magic and sleight of hand. Wowed the audience. Great show.
* Cirque du Soleil O at Bellagio - It was ok. Having seen Mystere and and Michael Jackson ONE before, I had high expectations. If there was a story line, I missed it.
* Blue Man Group at Luxor - Very good. Energetic. Some comedy. Interactive. Audience was engaged. *(Original plans for Terry Fator fell through due to show scheduling changes)*

**Dining on The Strip - all prices incl 20-22% tip:**

* **Edge Steakhouse at Westgate**. Wagyu Strip and Bone-in ribeye were excellent. Sides of grilled asparagus and mushrooms very tasty. Glass of Moscato. Creme Brulee for dessert. Huge wine selections. High end experience, attentive and quick service. $386. Recommend if you don't mind the price.
* **Momofuku at Cosmopolitan.** Shared Chef's Seasonal Menu for $48. Went with crispy quinoa green salad, corn ribs, shoyu pork ramen, and black sesame ice cream. Great ambiance, service and food. Recommend.
* **Bouchon at Venetian.** From acclaimed chef Thomas Keller. French Parisian brasserie. Sophisticated. Excellent service. Very good brunch with escargot, special of the day boudin blanc and merguez hash (think eggs, fancy sausage, and meats), croissant and coffee. $130. Recommend but too pricey for brunch.
* **Hell's Kitchen at Caesars.** Lively atmosphere reminiscing of the show from the same name. Dinner prefix with scallops, famed beef wellington, sticky toffee pudding plus a crispy skin salmon and one drink. $249. Very good and satisfying. Recommend.
* **Tao at Venetian**. Asian bistro, ritzy decor, exotic, sultry, lively. People taking photos and selfies to post that they've been there. Wifey wanted to go, I am getting all the sex I can handle so let's go!!!. Had miso roasted sea bass, spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice, short rib bao bun, moscato, potten carrot cake, coffee. $185. For the vibe, social media posting, food, people watching, highly recommend. But yeah expensive.
* **Din Tai Fung at Aria**. Popular asian restaurant famous for steamed dumplings. Nice modern decor. Lot of young diners. Had the xia long bao, seaweed bean curd, pot stickers, pork fried noodles, orange green tea. $91. I've had DTF elsewhere and it's always consistently good. Great service. Recommend and hope you don't get the same loud talking asshole sitting on the next table that almost ruined the meal.
* **The $79.99 dinner Buffet at Wynn vs $49.99 brunch Wicked Spoon at Cosmo vs $91.99 Bacchanal at Caesars.** Wynn buffet quality went down and service was lacking. Wicked Spoon was ok, good service. Bacchanal was fucking amazing and tons of food. Recommend Wicked Spoon and definitely Bacchanal.

**Dining off The Strip - all prices incl 20-22% tip:**

* **Viva las Arepas** (1616 S Las Vegas Blvd #120), 1/2 mile north of The Strat. Excellent Venezuelan food. Owners from Maracaibo. We had arepa con pernil, empanada de pollo, yuca con chicharron, malta, and agua de panela y limon. They even gave me a sample of cachapas con queso. $44. Highly recommend.
* **Shang Artisan Noodle** (Flamingo Decatur Plaza, about 3miles west of the Strip). Went off strip since had a car rental. Shang Beef Noodle, Pork Belly Noodle, 2 green tea. $42. Soup on the salty side. Hand made noodles had firm consistency. I've had better elsewhere but after a long drive and hungry, it did the job.
* **Rainbow Kitchen** (Eldorado Plaza, about 10miles SW of the Strip). Good dim sum. Packed with chinese people so you know it is good. IMO, a bit pricey compared to the East Coast. Friend invited so it tasted even better. I am guessing $85

We also rented a car for a couple of days and visited The Valley of Fire State Park, Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend. Recommend all 3 if you can, especially Antelope Canyon.

Overall Vegas wasn't crowded. There were noticeably more people late Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Day clubs attracted a lot young attractive girls in barely covering bikinis and skin showing mini skirts for nightclubs, and they definitely did not pack bras in their luggage. 

We don't gamble but did visit a few casinos. Bellagio, Wynn, Cosmo, Venetian and Palazzo were always crowded, while others like Paris, Harrah, Flamingo, and Horseshoe were more quiet. Shops at Crystal are nice to walk through. More power to you if you also shop there. Rode the free tram from Aria to Bellagio.

Bellagio fountains are blocked on the front due to construction for viewing seating boxes for F1. Hard Rock Cafe guitar looks massive and that's only half of the bottom part. Fountainebleau is beautiful but not many people because of being far from the Strip.",35,1760322139.0,vegas,4,0.91,False

Thank you to this group for all of the amazing resources. I don't have prediabetes yet but my last A1C came in at 5.4 and I thought making a change made sense now more than ever. 

I am having a huge road block though: I can't sleep. I've always been a good sleeper, now I'm averaging 5-6 hours a night. It's even worse on exercise days, which was a problem for me prior but now I get almost no sleep on those days. Melatonin helps me fall asleep but I'll wake up a few hours later and just stare at the ceiling.

Is this my body getting adjusted to the lower blood sugar/less carbs life? Has anyone experienced this? It's been a month and I'm ready to give up!

Here's what done so far:
Being more mindful of carbs and sugars, especially not having carbs in the morning
More fiber with my meals
Stopped eating after 7;30 (I ""go to bed"" at 10:30)
Lifting 2-3 days a week
Walks after meals that are heavier in carbs 
Because of the sleep thing, I swapped coffee for tea most days

Thank you!!

1o57lg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1o57lg0/dnf_first_marathon/,DNF first marathon,"Attempted my first marathon today and I did not finish. I tapped out at mile 22. I'm not exactly crushed but I am a little disappointed that I was only 4.2 miles from the finish line. Thru all of this, Ive determined that I really don't like distance running, so I'm not sure if I'll try again. I might in a year or two though. Surprisingly, no chaffing, though I did use copious amounts of Vaseline.

The marathon was in New England, which is currently being hit by the tropical storm/nor'easter and the race course went along the coast. Race was 8am-2pm, rain started around 10-11am. Temp was 60°F with winds between 10-30 mph. Race was mostly flat but had a few hills, and water/Gatorade every 2 miles. I'd been training ""from couch"" on and off since January this year until I injured my ankles around May that didn't heal until July. Then picked up training again. My plan was to ""walk/run"" the marathon with doing 13 minute miles to try to finish the race under 6 hrs. During my training, I began to strongly dislike any distance past 10k-8miles, but figured I had already paid for it so might as well carry on with the plan. The morning of the race, I got 8 hrs of sleep, woke up two hrs beforehand and had a plain bagel with jam and coffee. The beginning of the race was doing great. The views were beautiful, rain hadn't started yet, and I was fresh and bouncy and meeting my 13 minute mile. Then mile 10 hit and everything went down hill from there. The rain started, I ran thru puddles that got tiny pebbles in my shoes that I couldn't get out, I got slapped in the face by a wave that went over a seawall (tbf, I shouldn't of been that close to it, but I wanted to see the water 😂), I had thermals on but the wind was still making it cold. My fingers were stiff. I wanted to quit but pressed on. By mile 17, I was doing 15-17 minute miles, but I resolved to just finish an hr or so late (3pm, race finished at 2pm). However by 12:30-1pm, they had packed up the aid stations and mile marker flags. It was cold, I hadn't seen another soul for a good while, I was out of water (still had gels that I could've taken), it was pouring, the pebbles in my shoes were causing seering pain the likes of which I've never felt before, and by mile 22(1:30pm), someone from the race drove by to check in and said that in 30 minutes, I'd be completely unsupported and the finish line might not even be there anymore (due to the storm, they were having to pack up early. Initially they wouldve kept it up for a while after the race) and I just called it. 

Anyways, so that was my absolutely miserable experience of a first marathon 😂. I'm aware that these are all excuses for my failure, but at least I tried I guess. I should've just done the half marathon haha. ",3,1760321880.0,Marathon_Training,2,1.0,False

I was selling an over the top of desk standing desk that retails for $400 brand new for $200. It was like new, as I got RTO'd right after I bought it. I took a lot of pics with measurements etc. which featured my really nice, solid wood, desk that retails for about $1,900 in the background and even had a video demoing that the hydraulics work etc. 

Within minutes of the posting going up I got dozens of low ball offers from a bunch of college kids. $10, $8, $20 but you have to deliver. Ridiculous shit. I suspected I was being brigaded for a ""real"" low ball offer to come in later. 

Sure enough after 3 days of ridiculous offers, I got a offer of $50 from ""college bro"" which was double the next highest offer. I was thinking about how I wanted to the dude who had been wasting my time and trying to trick me into getting my desk for cheap. I was going to give this desk to a local non-profit or coworker or something before I would sell it to this guy. But before I could even reply he sent a follow up message, the greedy fuck just couldn't help himself. 

> And your listing includes the desk underneath right? 

I admit I let my temper get the best of me a little bit. So I told him sorry sweetie no it doesn't. But actually I guess this desk just isn't worth what I paid for it. I thought I was offering a good deal for my $400 desk, yadda yadda. Spin the yarn and said I'd sell it but I could only meet him at [public location really far from his school at 5am]. He pushed back on both the location and time and I went on and on about how I'm so sorry but I have a baby and full time job and that is the only time her dad will be able to watch her. So he agreed but only if I knock it down to $30 and I said ok. 

I actually am always up at that time, due to baby that part was not a lie,  so once I got the ""I'm in the Black F450"" I replied with I'm in the (Rick Roll link). Rated him one star and blocked him, while ai stayed cozy warm cuddling kiddo and drinking my coffee.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.


My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.


I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!


**KAIFENG = 3 nights** but I wished I had another two nights here. I will return!


I took a 3hr 30-seat bus from Dengfeng to Kaifeng for 42 yuan. The ride was safe and the bus was clean, comfortable but old – no air-con, the windows were kept open. **I bought my long-distance bus ticket online, two days in advance. I used my guide’s mobile phone number to complete the transaction as I had an eSim. You need a Chinese mobile number to book long-distance bus tickets online (or buy at the ticket office but I didn’t want to wait and risk missing a seat on the bus that I needed). When you get to the bus station, look for the ticket office, show them your booking number and passport, then they give you a paper ticket. Find the entry point and get your bags scanned, like at the train stations and airports. To save time, I looked for a staff member and showed him my ticket, who pointed at the bus that I needed to catch. As I headed to the bus, another staff member approached me, checked my ticket then took my suitcase and put it in the luggage compartment while I hopped in. You can sit anywhere on the bus, it wasn’t allocated seating so arrive early so you can sit towards the front – I find its often bumpier at the back of the bus.**


The bus picked up lots of passengers along the way and dropped people off at random intersections or at red traffic light stops – not an official bus stop. I got off the bus on a main road and had to wheel myself to safety – onto a footpath. Its a bit dangerous… Then, I jumped into a taxi to get to my hotel called **Songchao Bianjing Hotel (Kaifeng Drum Tower Square branch) for 3 nights = $123 AUD including daily soybean drinks and a snack between 10pm-12am, delivered to my room by a robot, every night.** This hotel was tucked away, hidden behind other buildings, on a main street. You had to walk through a metal-barred gate and car-park to reach the hotel. The room was clean, modern etc. I would stay here again. Foreigners stay here too. Look on Trip.com and check the reviews.


There were no metros here and I didn’t want to waste time figuring out how to catch the bus so I caught a taxi everywhere, not DiDi. The most that I paid was 15 yuan for a ride and it was a 30min walk to reach many attractions. I visited the following places in Kaifeng:


**Daxiangguo Temple.** This temple is considered one of the top ten famous temples in China. It has a really nice koi fish pond, several halls to explore, a vegetarian restaurant and a shop. I recommending visiting here. I saw foreigners here too. 1hr-2hrs is enough.


**Yanqing Taoist Temple.** I stopped here for 45min as it was along my walking route. What made this temple special were the temple roofs, an underground passage with a worship hall and big ying-yang symbol on the ground. Photos of how this temple looked like over the years, from the Yuan Dynasty = 13th to 14th Century til now, with various renovations and expansions are displayed around the complex. The central three-storey tower is made of brick but designed to look like wood and it has a unique Mongolian style yurt-roof. Many visitors prayed here and with huge incense sticks!


**Memorial Temple of Lord Bao.** Lord Bao Zheng was a famous, well-respected, honest and upright official in the Northern Song Dynasty. There are many TV shows and movies about him. You will need about 2hrs to explore this place as there are also several halls with lots of artefacts, a wax museum with lifelike figures recreating scenes from some of Lord Bao’s legendary court cases, a garden with rock sculptures and ponds, snack stalls, and a lovely river-view area at the back. If you have time, drop by…


**Starlight New World Shopping Mall.** This mall is massive. I came here for dinner, coffee and to stock up on snacks for the next few days. Its a bit out of the way, not close to any tourist attractions, so only visit if you have time.


**Gulou Night Market & Drum Tower.** Highly recommend coming here at night. You will need 3hrs+ to enjoy this market as there are many stalls selling lots of different items, street shops behind the stalls and to explore the huge food section with outdoor seating. The Drum Tower is wonderfully lit up at night and cars do drive through it. This was the most memorable night market experience for me in China, on this trip. Its about a 15min walk from my hotel and I visited this market, twice.


**Millennium City Park theme park.** One of the reasons I wanted to visit Kaifeng was for this place and it became one of my favourite days of the trip! I bought my ticket on Trip.com and it included entry to the Song Dynasty Dongjing Dreaming Show which had fireworks at the end too. The design of this theme park is inspired by a 5.25 metre long hand-scroll painting called Riverside Scenes at Qingming Festival or Along the River during the Qingming Festival by Zhang Zeduan, a famous artist of the Northern Song Dynasty. This painting is considered a masterpiece, a treasure, among all Chinese paintings as it captures the daily life of people – from the rich to the poor, and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present day Kaifeng). FYI, Kaifeng is one of the eight ancient capitals of China and its really worth visiting (this 5A theme park and the city itself).

I was in this theme park for nearly 12hrs and I didn’t see everything. I watched many skit, street and folklore performances, live cockfighting, several outdoor stage shows, saw people play ancient card games and eat traditional handmade candy. All the staff are dressed up in hanfu (traditional outfit) and the place is designed like an ancient town with a pagoda, pedestrian bridges, dragon boats you can ride along the river, shops, restaurants, a market area, scenic walkways, a petting zoo for the kids, a water-park (great place to cool down), indoor theatre, museums... you can also rent hanfu (traditional outfit) to take photos here too. As you wander through the theme park, its like you’ve been transported back into time… I highly recommend spending a full day here if you can. Consider this like the Chinese version of Universal Studios & Disney combined but with no rides, the shows are worth watching.


**Imperial Street of Song Dynasty.** I wandered along this street around 10am and it was very quiet. Not many shops were open and its a bit run down. I think this street been kept for historical or cultural reasons. A quick 15min walk through and to get to the Dragon Pavilion is enough time to say you’ve been here, ticked it off the list – if you want to.


**Dragon Pavilion / Longting.** I spend about 2hrs here. This was the royal palace for many dynasties and its been rebuilt as a tourist park. If you walk up the 72 steps of the main building – Dragon Pavilion, you will get a nice panoramic view of the area; its surrounded by a wide lake, antique pavilions and you can see the modern side of the city in the distance. There’s a lotus pond, garden area, several side-halls which are now wax work museums, an island with a tea-house. I visited in the morning and it wasn’t crowded. I read this park holds a chrysanthemum festival here, every autumn, and I think it would be very beautiful place to visit.


**Wanshuishanwuxiacheng / Wansui Mountain Martial Arts City theme park.** I stumbled across this attraction whilst searching what to visit in Kaifeng, on Trip.com. Its similar to Millennium City Park but is designed with a fantasy theme instead. If you watch Xianxia shows, this is an absolute must visit! There are also a few rides here, but more for the kids. I spent 5hrs here and it wasn’t enough time – I didn’t get to watch any of the shows as all the tickets were sold out by the time I arrived. I will need to come back to fully experience what this theme park has to offer. I did enjoy wandering around all the different themed areas and watched some 20min outdoor performances, a steam-punk inspired parade (a bit out of theme, I know).


I didn’t have time to visit some other attractions such as Kaifeng Museum, Kaifengu, Tianbo Yang Mansion, Han Yuan Stele Forest, Shan Shan Gan Guild Hall, Ancient City Wall, and the Iron Pagoda. So, I will return to Kaifeng… I really enjoyed my time in Henan province.

I've checked out some of the companies I've seen recommended on this forum (e.g. Quark, Aurora, etc.) and it seems like they cater to a crowd that wants luxury. The cheapest option for Quark was a ship with a spa, masseuses, a gym, sauna, fancy dining room, and all of that. I neither want nor need any of that. I much prefer ""roughing it"", as it were.

Are there options that do away with unnecessary creature comforts, and are therefore presumably cheaper? I'm more than happy to pay for quality, but I don't need a freaking masseuse during a trip like this. A solid ship and crew, the necessary equipment and enough food, water, and coffee to survive is basically all I'm looking for.

They suggest you use their ""Flex"" pricing option (and you set your minimum acceptable price) but then they HIDE YOUR POSTING (by removing it from ""recommended"" status) with THEIR suggested price because it's not competitive??","Set up my listing, did their suggested flex pricing option since it's my first time selling and I really didn't know what to expect, but getting etix into pdf and setting everything up took quite a while, so while I didn't want to rip anyone off, I wanted to at least break even or make like $20 for the hassle. The ""flex"" pricing is supposed to automatically adjust the asking price per real time demand. You set your minimum acceptable price. 



Took a nap for a couple hours, woke up and checked the site and my listing was not there. I thought the tickets sold, but no. Going into my account, it says **they removed the ""recommended"" status of my listing due to ""my"" price not being competitive -- ok, that was THEIR suggested price, not mine**?? The whole point of the ""flex pricing"" option was that they would lower the price if it weren't competitive, and that did not happen.



And my listing was not just ""reduced in visibility"" or sorted to the bottom due to them removing the ""recommended"" status, it was **LITERALLY NOT THERE**. I don't even understand this because I could still see other listings that did not have the ""recommended"" tag, but not mine. So for those peak Sunday morning hours when people were perusing options for evening plans over coffee, my listing was not showing up. 



The flex pricing thing did not seem to work at all, as the price I would receive NEVER changed (higher or lower) unless I updated it manually (always lower). However, they did slightly increase/decrease the price the seller would pay for it (since they don't specify the exact % that service fees are, so *those* were on surge/market pricing) -- *so it seems only Stubhub could possibly benefit from the ""flex pricing.""* .... And I'm assuming their service fees are always on surge pricing, so what is the point?? I spent a few **hours** refreshing and revising my acceptable price lower and lower (manually) as the concert time approached. Ended up selling great tickets in a sold out section at a loss, and basically wasted my whole day stressing, refreshing, adjusting, etc. 



I really hope I at least get my $ since I spent forever following all their rules to fill everything out perfectly, uploading pdf tickets for instant download, etc.... The good news is that the buyers did get a good deal in this case; they got tickets $10 below face value for limited reserved seating (2 seats together) that sold out several months ago. So I hope those folks have a very good time since I feel like I wasted my entire day on this stupid website AND lost $. I hope I never have to resort to using this site ever again.

1o57aiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o57aiw/silent_treatment/,Silent treatment,"

I, 23F, moved home after college and got a job in my hometown to help out my parents and save money. I rejected a job opportunity from their advise as I’d be saving money by coming home. It was honeymoon phase for a while but I always have a weird relationship with my mom (45F) If she is not in control she gets upset. To tell you that I didn’t wear crop top till I was 21 lol and now I’m too old to actually wear them.

Well i quit my job earlier this year bc they treated me poorly like hr worthy. she was upset that I didn’t push through it. I still pay them my monthly rent and the family phone bill and my car insurance since I’d be paying rent  if I lived somewhere else. But I’ve had difficulty finding another job since. 

Like I spend all day applying or going to interviews and I can’t find one in my hometown or get hired in the city near us. 

Pinpointing my fault:

I stopped helping with cooking bc my family either doesn’t eat my cooking or my mother gets upset when I’m not fast enough when helping so I’ve just avoided the kitchen until the evening when it’s just me. I know that upsets her that in her mind she has to come home tired from work and make dinner (I make my own meals) but I can’t handle her taking out her stress on me not right now when I’m going through it with this job market. I still keep the house clean and do chores (wash the bathrooms, front yard work etc…) to be thankful for giving me a place to stay I know not a lot of people even have that.

My mother also is blunt honest and sometimes her honesty is unkind. I wasn’t planned and she did have to give up her dreams and be a single mother for me and I’ll forever be grateful. I know not all moms are like this but sometimes I wish she was more kind, and encouraging rather than putting doubts in my head. Like last week I realized my mother has never called me pretty, idk maybe it isn’t so uncommon but most of my girlfriends have such a tight best friend relationship with their moms that mine feels odd. She has a really good relationship with her 4 sisters, sometimes to the point where I mentally envy it. I rarely see them fight and she talks to them everyday for at least an hour. 

Well one comment really got to me in August, since then I haven’t really shared with her anything and talking to her just makes me feel more sad like I was when I was a teenager. I can share what the comment was but this post is already unnecessaryily long enough. 

But today I let her know I was going to work a gig at a bbq grill place I used to bartend at last summer just to get enough to at least have money for my rent this month and to stop picking at my savings. I don’t drink or smoke or anything like that if anything I have no friends and am rather boring. So it’s not like I was going to do something bad.

Well she gave me the silent treatment, looked me up and down and looked away like I was some unimportant thing she found bothering her this morning. Like an ant in your coffee lol. Idk why i told her maybe just let her know out of courtesy.

I couldn’t care less what other people think of me but sometimes what she does still gets to me. I got home and everything went okay at work just business people grabbing lunch/drinks after work since it was a day shift. I liked getting out my house and working. I’ve worked since I was a teenager and while this break has felt okay, I need money and a job.

My problem:

Well now I’m on silent treatment lol. 

When my stepdad and her argue they do 3month long silent treatments at times or like she once did it with her parents for 2yrs until they passed away (she didn’t get speak to them). 

I don’t really want to do that lol (2yrs is a long time let alone 3months that’s a high score lol). I can but to me it’s a bit immature. 

I’m rather calm person so it’s not like she’s avoiding a confrontation or anything. Idk why she’s doing it.

So idk I try to understand her and not blame her but it’s so mentally taxing to me to be comprehensive 24/7. I’m trying my best to find a job to move out but it’s difficult with so many layoffs and little full time job experience. 

How does one best handle this. I know the day I move out will be painful. But idk I’m almost just over it. If any parent has done a silent treatment maybe lmk why lol. Maybe I’m missing something. 

TL;DR Handling silent treatment from military style parent lol?

I mean, I have hobbies, a social life and a coffee routine, so I get out of the house. But I love staying alone with all of my favorite things and the free will to do literally anything I want to. I have a rich imagination and inner world where I spend most of my time, which I pour into making art. I also study and read constantly. I pursue new things on a whim. I don't have a work schedule because I'm self-employed and I sleep/wake literally whenever I feel like it. I don't have social media. I only deeply connect with a handful of women, and am happy to keep the rest of my relationships shallow. I live creatively like I did when I was a child, before getting involved with men and other parts of society who traumatized me, except for having to worry about paying bills but that part's nbd tbh. I feel like a wizard happy to be left to building/making things in their isolated tower, and I really couldn't be any happier.

I don't like being around other people for too long because it takes me away from all of that. (Even good company, like yes I love my time with you but I still prefer existing alone.) I've also had jealous people (*especially* men) traumatize me by going out of their way to ruin my peace. And many want to give ""advice"" (thinly veiled judgemental comments) about how to live my life, when I genuinely would never trade places with anyone. They all infantilize me, nevermind the fact that I've been living alone since before 18 and am financially more secure than them. To me, they are the ones that should be infantilized because they don't have the autonomy to live their life like *they want to* instead of how other people tell them their life should be even though they're clearly miserable people. Tbh I don't even really consider myself 4b, even though I've been living this way for years- I just prefer a carefree, fully autonomous, low-stress life, and I dislike responsibilities, so I just chose not to have them. But I guess that doesn't make me a ""real adult"" in their eyes. Once, another woman told me this: ""Sounds like a life with no responsibilities."" They meant it as an insult, but I just told them ""yup, I set my life up that way specifically. You can too if you want to.""

Like I said, I wouldn't even label myself 4b but I'm posting here because I feel like there's so few spaces in women-centered communities where I could say stuff like this and have people relate lol",48,1760320312.0,4bmovement,4,0.98,False

I’m heading to Oahu soon for my first ever solo trip (6 days in Waikiki/Honolulu area) and I’m both excited and a little nervous. Would love some advice from people who’ve been!

I’m planning to do some hiking, surfing, snorkeling, and just explore local spots. I’ll probably use public transport or rent a moped, and maybe get a car for a day or two if it’s worth it.

A few things I’d love recommendations for:
	•	Hidden gems – beaches, viewpoints, hikes, or chill local spots that aren’t super touristy
	•	Good food – poke, local plates, coffee shops, etc.
	•	Things to do solo – group surf lessons, tours, fun places to meet people
	•	Hostel experiences – any recommendations or ones to avoid in Waikiki? I’m thinking of staying at a social but clean and safe hostel
	•	Safety – how safe did you feel leaving valuables on the beach/hostel?

1o56wdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1o56wdu/aita_for_making_my_friend_break_up_with_her/,AITA for making my friend break up with her boyfriend who is secretly married,"My friend (23F) had been dating a guy (36M) for almost 6 months without knowing that he's married. When she first told me about her new boyfriend, she spoke so highly of him. almost as if he's perfect. but I knew something was off.. quite frankly, no one can pretend to be perfect forever 

When they were dating, we got the chance to hang out as a group, My friend, her boyfriend, and another couple of our girl friends. My first impression was that, he was so put together, a real sweet talker who knows exactly how to hold a conversation with a group of girls, and knows how to keep everyone invested in what he's saying. He was overly flirty with my friend, and mildly flirty with every other girl sitting at the table. But I didn't wanna call him out, because i simply didn't know enough about him... until a week ago 

A close friend of mine, who was hanging out with us on the day we met this so called ""boyfriend"", sent me a link, to a facebook profile of a man that looks exactly like him... BUT with a different name, shorter beard and longer hair. When i scrolled through his profile I noticed a post of him and another woman... and the more i scrolled, the worse it got. because it turns out, he's married and even has two kids. 

But i didn't want to drop it on my friend all at once. so I met up with her for a cup of coffee the very next day, and explained to her what i stumbled upon. When she saw the pictures she froze. for a good minute she was in complete disbelief... but she ended up calling him to confront him. She put him on speaker so that i could hear the conversation, and asked him what his real name was... tho he was quite confused, my friend went on and told him that she found his old facebook profile where he posted his wife and two kids. she repeated herself and asked him what his real name was.. and thats when he admitted and said ""i had to lie to you, to protect you"" which threw us off. My friend told him that she's done with him, and declined the call. He kept calling back, but she didn't answer

The next day I got a dm request on ig from this guy, calling ME a whore and a home wrecker. But i was quite confused because he never knew i was involved. Turns out, my friend had spoken to him once she got back home after hanging out with me... and he had pretty much tried to justify himself by saying that he's married, but separated, and that everyone has flaws, and he's trying his best to get over the mistakes he made in the past. My friend had mentioned that I was the one who found that profile.. which made him furious. From what i know, he spent the whole night trying to manipulate my friend and convince her that he's the perfect guy for her. which ultimately worked, because she was convinced that he's ""a changed man who's trying to get over the mistakes he made in the past"" AND even went further by telling my friend that I was flirting with him the first time we met... which obviously isn't true

but like i mentioned earlier, my friend was head over heels for this guy, and everything else about him was perfect to her. so she bought his lie, and ended up telling me that she wants to take a break from our friendship. because she feels like i crossed a line.

The market’s favorite altar boy — Palantir — is getting nervous looks from the crowd, and a few nimble AI upstarts are quietly polishing their pitch decks like daggers. Analysts and a $35B fund manager are saying the same thing in different fonts: the rotation off mega-cap “AI winners” into under-owned AI enablers is starting.

Why it matters to you (yes, you building a side project between coffee runs): concentration breeds fragility. Palantir’s execution has fans, but multiples are stretched enough to give a bull market hiccups. Meanwhile SoundHound and UiPath are posting real product progress — revenue lifts, margin improvements, agentic AI plays — the kind of stuff investors punish when absent and reward when visible.

Fund managers aren’t philosophizing; they’re reallocating. The $35B manager prepping for flows isn’t hoping for chaos — they’re budgeting for it. If AI sentiment gets skittish, money leaves the megacaps and trickles (or stampedes) into names that look like real business, not myth. That’s your rotation.

For founders and indie devs, the takeaway isn’t to time the market. It’s to notice market wiring. Investors will reward clarity: durable revenue, visible margins, and agentic, production-ready AI that reduces friction — not vaporware that sounds good in a slide deck.

If you’re a consultant or skeptic, be the one asking: which names actually turned pilots into payments? Which products have customers who’ll fight for renewal? The next leg of the AI trade won’t be about the loudest logo on a cap — it’ll be about the company that stops sounding like a thesis and starts sounding like a utility.

Moral of the story? Worship fundamentals, not narratives. And if you’re sitting on a Palantir love letter in your portfolio — trim, pair it with a basket of improving AI enablers, or sleep with one eye open. The market loves prophets until it doesn’t.",1,1760319800.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

This is my first post here and I wanted to share a bit about my walking journey.

Yesterday (Sunday), I walked 18.5 km, and the previous Sunday I did 16.8 km. I’ve started doing these long walks once a week, and on regular days I usually get around 7,000–8,000 steps.

I don’t have a specific goal in mind — just trying to keep myself active and fit. Alongside walking, I’ve been following 16:8 intermittent fasting, so my long walks happen in a fasted state (only black coffee before the walk).

Would love to hear from experienced walkers —
👉 Any tips to improve performance and endurance over time?
👉 How do you take care of your body (hydration, nutrition, recovery) while doing frequent long walks, especially in a fasted state?

Thanks in advance! Excited to learn from this community 😊

1o56sjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1o56sjw/taking_flight_chapter_79_emergency_exit/,"Taking Flight, Chapter 79: Emergency Exit","As the battle continues to rage on outside, Whisk and Two were busy getting the ""evacuation plan"" ready. They scoured every inch of the temple chamber for as many ""spare parts"" as possible. Broken relics, abandoned tools, dubiously stable energy receptacles, anything would do. The two take a moment to admire the haul they've amassed so far for their plan.

SMG2: Yeah........ I think this'll do. 

The old Enochian worktables were comparatively archaic, but Two still deems it fit enough for the task at hand and gets to work. Every piece was carefully selected and fitted together as quickly and precisely as possible to ensure whatever he was making would actually function as intended. 

Whisk: Are....... you sure this will work?

SMG2: As sure as the sun will shine........... Minus the weather, of course.

Another Grim manages to stumble its way into the chamber. It scrambles for the two, taking a deep breath as it prepares to shriek before the blade of a fire axe bites into its neck. The Grim flails and flounders, air whistling through the opening in its neck as it fails to shriek. The last thing it sees is the empty black sockets of a gas mask approaching it, wretches the axe from its neck, and brings it back down to finish the job. 

Garnet: (So. How's that plan of yours coming along?)

Whatever contraption Two's been working on seems to be coming together nicely. The sheer amount of functionional Metarunner tech they were able to find speaks volumes of how well preserved this place is. It's the find of a lifetime. 

SMG2: Just about ready. Just need to make a little tweak here and.......

A circuit is linked. The device sputters to life. A charge can be felt in the air. 

SMG2: EUREKA! 

Garnet heads back outside and is pleased to see Tari keeping up the heat as she takes to the air once more. She cleaves through swaths of Grim at breakneck speed, swooping and diving her way through the onslaught of beating wings on her tail, using every weapon at her disposal to thin out the horde. Garnet's ""suppressing fire"" is also helping, and she can't deny how cathartic it is to see a burning Grim plummeting down and eating s*** on the Ziggurat's face. Tödliche was also having a grand time lining up collaterals with his Tesla pistol. Comes to show that a surgeon's steady hand still has its uses outside the doctor's office. Damien's focus has turned to the Husks climbing up the Ziggurat's face. He nails one in the head. It's gut swells and stretches before it rips open. A writhing Geist seething with volatile energy emerges from the Husk and floats towards them, but a quick kick punts it away before it detonates in a burning explosion of false blood.

Damien: Ground Team, what the hell is going on down there!?

His answer comes hurdling towards him. He dodges out of the way before it lands upon the steps with a sickening splat. It was the Sniper, flail from head to toe and tangled in spectral threads. Back on the ground, the Subjugator peels the remnants of clothing and skin from the head of its Glaive before advancing towards the Ziggurat. Meggy quickly loads up a box magazine into her bowgun and lays into the advancing threat, pelting it with a cloud of high caliber rounds. Grace was busy reloading her crossbow when she felt something coil around her leg. She is suddenly dragged out of cover by the ankle as a tether of strands drags her towards the Subjugator, eagerly waiting to gut her like a fish before Flynt's Shield Saw slices through the line and sets her free. 

Flynt: Hey, Mr. Sillystring! 

The Saw then comes around and nicks the Subjugator in the thigh before returning to Flynt's wrist. The two clash, Argent Energy grinding against Psionic Strands as their blades crossed. 

Flynt: I've seen bigger. 

While the battle continues to unfold around the Ziggurat, the Mercs at Base Camp have issues of their own to deal with. The Mercs have been fighting for their lives against more of those *things* charging in from the mists. Vincent and May were back to back gunning down Husks and Grim, whereas Marston has been on a rampage with a trench gun. Ivan manages to yoink a Grim by the tail and swings it like a mace against oncoming Husks. One tries to land a sneak attack, but Randal comes in for the save and slices the Husk open with an Arc Blade. He then rips the Geist out of the Husk and hurls it at an oncoming pack, taking them all out in a spectacular chain reaction of volatile explosions.

Ivan: Many thanks!

The YLW Engineer wasn't as lucky when a Grim hooks him by the shoulder and hauls him up screaming while another grabs his legs. Rufus is unable to get a good shot before the two Grim rip the Engineer in half, spilling his entrails across the field. Another unfortunate Merc, a RED Spy, thought he had gotten away from the carnage until a Grim perched atop the crate he was hiding behind. It pounces him and pins him to the ground before shrieking directly into his face. The immense sonic pressure shattered his eardrums, and his eyes popped out of his sockets as the resonant frequencies bounced within his skull. Rufus was able to bat it off with his rifle, but the Spy's brain had already been reduced to sludge. 

Rufus: Piss Almighty........

Up atop the bridge of the ship, Kaizo and Melony are doing all they can to clear out the Grim. Melony dashed and darted through the air, her sword gliding through Grim as if they were lukewarm margarine. That is, until a sonic scream rattles her of balance and sends her tumbling onto the top deck. As she struggles to regain her bearings, several Grim all make a dive for her, their claws outstretched and their tails pointed like spears. Just as they closed in for the kill......

Kaizo: HEADS UP!

A spark of soulfire was flung towards the murder. In the blink of an eye, the spark grous and erupts into a brilliant scarlet flame. The Grim scrambled, reeling from the burns, and giving Kaizo the chance to help Melony get back to her feet. 

Kaizo: You alright, sleepy head?

Melony: Ugh........ give me a minute. 

Her head was spinning like a windcatcher in a hurricane, and she could still hear that shriek echoing in her ears. Kaizo turns to see the Grim settling back into formation, still smoking from those hellish blisters. Melony brought her guard up in anticipation for another one of those sonic blasts.

Kaizo: Relax. I got this. You just take a seat.

He sits Melony down on a nearby crate before turning back to the Grim. She didn't quite understand the sudden concern for safety until she noticed the dufflebag slung over his shoulder. More specifically, it was a ""Three's Coffee N' Bombs"" bag, logo and everything. Then she noticed the big goofy grin on Kaizo's face. He was up to something. 

Kaizo: If anyone still wishes to scurry back into their hole, now's your chance!

The only reply he got was gargling hisses and the clatter of claws aching to rip something apart. He remains unphased as he reaches into the bag.

Kaizo: Alright then........ Your funeral.

And from the bag he draws............ a blue mannequin with googly eyes and a cap........ who is also very much alive and pretty chill. Yeah, sorry to those who assumed this was gonna be a super awesome weapon, but you should know what they say about assuming. It makes an ASS out of U and MING.

Ming: Hi. My name is Ming, and I don't appreciate what your assumptions have done to my reputation. 

Melony: Uh.......... 

Kaizo: You're in for a treat. Just wait.

One of the Grim charges in for the kill, but is sent tumbling back with a swift jab to the throat. 

Ming: You shouldn't have assumed I couldn't defend myself. Now be both look foolish. 

And so Ming proceeds to absolutely wipe the floor with the Grim. He pulls out every move in the book, such as the sharpened skullsplitter, the 52 point pulse, and even the 360 degree spin cycle suplex. Melony is genuinely flabbergasted at how fast he was, snapping ceramic bones with swift and brutal strikes. As for Kaizo, he personally finds it hilarious. 

Kaizo: HAHAHAH! Now THIS is some prime time action!

He pulls out a bucket of chicken and takes a seat beside her. 

Kaizo: You hungry? 

Melony: I........ *sigh*......

She was too tired and concussed to even bother with questions. While the two are sitting back and enjoying the show, a hatch opens up on the airship's belly to let a hanging platform drop. Waiting below is SMG1 with a backpack loaded with all the research he could carry, along with Mario carrying the rest in a giant crate. A pair of Husks rushes to intercept, but both are stopped in their tracks with a well placed shot from Belle's handcannon. 

Belle: QUIT MUCKING ABOUT AND GET UP HERE! 

Mario drops the crate as soon as he steps aboard. 

SMG1: CAREFUL WITH THAT! Some of those relics are just barely stable!

Mario: Sorry! My ass was starting to itch so I REALLY needed a free hand.

SMG3: ANYONE WHO'S NOT DEAD, GRAB WHAT YOU CAN AND HOP ON! WE ARE LEAVING!

The Mercenaries make a hastly retreat to the platform. The gunfire continues until they've been lifted up into the ship and the hatch swings shut. 

Rob: All surviving personnel accounted for, captain. 

Kaizo: Top deck is clear. Ming took care of our bat problem. 

SMG3: Good. Let's get out of here.

As the ship takes off, what's left of the camp is quickly ripped asunder by the razorhail before it's blown away by the relentless winds. The remaining assailants dart to cover. A tall figure watches from afar as the ship disappears in the storm.

The pressure was on, not because she was demanding, but because I really wanted to get her a win, you know? My expectations, honestly, were rock bottom. I figured I’d be lucky to get a handful of clicks, maybe a 'like' or two.

One night, fueled by some questionable instant coffee, I decided to just go all in. I dove deep into the weirdest, most specific long-tail keywords imaginable. I wasn't just thinking 'gold necklace'; I was thinking 'minimalist gold-plated bee pendant for nature lovers.' I wrote ad copy that I felt spoke directly to that one person who was looking for exactly that. I polished everything, hit 'launch,' and logged off for the night, completely expecting to wake up to a budget spent and zero sales.

I woke up the next morning, did my usual routine, and opened the Google Ads dashboard, bracing myself for the familiar sight of single-digit clicks. But the screen loaded, and I literally thought the dashboard was broken. The numbers were just… impossible. A flood of conversions. A ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) that looked like a typo. My little $20 experiment had somehow pulled in over $500 in sales while I was sleeping.

I immediately messaged the client, sending her a screenshot with a message like, 'IS THIS REAL?!' She was absolutely ecstatic, and honestly, seeing her pure joy was better than any metric on a screen. It was one of those rare, perfect moments in marketing where you feel less like a spreadsheet jockey and more like some kind of digital wizard.

Been meaning to share this.

""So, I travelled by Premium Economy today. It was my first experience. I have only flown on economy thus far. I fly reasonable often. 10 round trip flights in the last 6 months. Mostly Indigo, some on Air India and one time on AI Express

Was scheduled on an Air India flight. Delhi - Bengaluru leg on AI 2815 on one of the erstwhile Vistara jets. I opted for an upgrade offer a few days before my date of flying. I paid 1200 rupees. I believe the actual difference in fare between Economy and Premium Economy is 2-2.5K. 

Of the 24 seats I think occupancy was 50%. I noted business had only 2 occupants (25% occupancy) People seem to be very fairly price sensitive.

Me? Economy works well. I don’t see the point of spending more to get to the same place at the same time. I am reasonably fit and somewhere between young and old. Still on the fence. But for 1200 bucks I had to try. Couldn’t pass this. Assuming I would have coughed up 600-800 bucks for a sandwich and a seat if this were an Indigo flight - not bad I thought... Not had at all... 

Btw did I mention you the ticket was purchased at a lower price than Indigo to begin with?

**Onto the actual experience what’s new (to me)**

1. Priority boarding
2. Leg space is generous
3. A little menu card with 3-4 items to choose from
4. A wet towel
5. I had a masala uttapam and rice cakes with spiced indian lentils 😂 it was quite good won’t lie. . Its amazing how Idli and Sambar becomes spiced indian lentils and rice cakes a just a few rows up 
6. Food is served in slightly better plastic ware. You get proper cutlery to enjoy your rice cakes
7. Seats was quite comfy! An Indigo flight from Ranchi earlier this month felt like sitting on a steel frame
8. The coffee was goood! None of that premix nonsense

**Other (almost) insignificant thing**

1. Almost all the people in PE around me were reading !?! - I felt a little stupid for putting together this note when I could have been reading 
2. Sooo its a little intimidating. But its amazing how for a few thousands the whole experience and how you are seen in the eyes of the airline and co-passengers jumps by leaps and bounds. I feel very awkward when people are extra nice in hospitality and get very conscious. 
3. So premium economy is sandwiched between business and economy. Literally the middle class. I wanted to pee. Now it took me a moment to figure if I could use the one at the front where business class passengers go or go to the back of the plan like I normally do. 

I would have been happier peeing at the back of the plane like i normally do truthfully. All in all good experience. I was hoping i wouldn’t love it

The return flight on good ol economy will be humbling. 

Thanks for reading!""

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1o56hbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o56hbo/feeling_unsure_despite_3_really_great_dates/,Feeling unsure despite 3 really great dates…,"Looking for some input from women about dating expectations.

I’m in my late 30s and am back in the dating scene after exiting a 3 year relationship earlier this year.

I’ve been on a lot of dates with women ranging from my age down to about 30 which is the lowest I’ll go.

I’ve been on 3 dates with this girl I’m interested in but am starting to question whether or not she’s just in it for the fun we’re having or if I’m expecting too much too soon. My gut tells me I’m not, but that’s why I’d love feedback.

Date 1: I made reservations for a nice Argentinian restaurant where we had some tapas and a glass of wine. We then walked to get ice cream after(her suggestion) before calling it a night. She offered to drive me back to my place and when we got there I told her I had a great time and went in for a kiss and she told me that was moving a bit fast for her, but reiterated she was interested in me.

I reflected on this a bit and thought I was odd since we had already been talking a week or so prior to the date and had mentioned we both really enjoyed how easy it was to talk to one another. Body language on the date was good and she seemed very comfortable around me, so it confused me a bit when she rejected my advance. Later that week, she told me she was free on Friday, so I asked her out again.

Date 2: I make reservations at a nice sushi spot, chefs counter, and we had a great dinner and lots of conversation. Laughs, subtle jabs at one another, occasional nervous giggles. You know. Then she tells me her friends who were visiting had ended up stranded in a part of town and she was worried she might have to go rescue them. I told her let’s go scoop up your friends and make sure they’re okay. So we wrapped dinner and drove to pick up her friends and took them to Chinatown where we walked around together and had a good time. My date said she had to pick something up from the office and offered to give me and her friend(another girl) a tour, so we did that. Afterwards we walked to our cars and I gave her a hug goodbye and we parted ways.

She texted me later that night and apologized profusely for the interruption to our date. I reiterated how fun it actually was and that she nor her friends were an inconvenience. Then I dropped a small half joke about maybe someday kissing her, to which she said it was definitely not the right time for that when her friend was standing nearby waiting to get in the car. I told her yea I get it and that I wasn’t trying to push it. I did ask her if she wanted to hang out again, and didn’t hear back til the next day to which she said she didn’t want to hang out but would gladly go on another date.

I responded letting her know I was gonna be out of town for about a week and a half and it would be nice to see her before I leave, and suggested dinner and a movie at my place. She said she had plans during the week but asked if we could meet for coffee or lunch today, so we met for lunch. 

Date 3: We had a casual lunch at a ceviche spot and again had great convo about family, relationships, personal development, and stuff. No awkwardness whatsoever. I did ask her about her previous comment about not wanting to “hang out”, to which she replied she doesn’t hang out with guys. She seemed to get a bit flustered when I pressed her on it and reiterated that she just dates very intentionally and considers time with someone she’s interested in a date until they are together and around each other more. After we finished, she asked if she could meet my dog, at home to which I agreed. We popped by, she played with my dog, and then we left. I dropped her off back at home and she gave me a hug before we parted ways. As she walked away she said I’ll see you when you get back from your trip.

By now I’m just feeling a bit confused. She seems genuinely interested in getting to know me, she’s been proactive in suggesting plans and making time for us, she seems apologetic about things that have interrupted that time. I don’t know, it just feels odd that the times when we had a great date, and we definitely could have kissed, even today, I’m just not seeing the right body language.

It’s also getting to a point where we’ve been on three dates and she hasn’t offered to pay or even split the check once. This has nothing to do with the lack of affection and is just another dynamic I thought was worth considering.

Am I wrong for feeling like 3 good dates is more than enough to want to kiss someone you’re interested in? I want to be mindful of different people’s needs and comfort levels with intimacy. But also, am I getting taken for a ride? She’s absolutely gorgeous and is a delight to spend time with, but I can’t really tell if this is going anywhere and am debating reaching out to just ask cause I’m tired of feeling confused.

Anyways, let me know your thoughts or ask questions if you want to know more.

He came to me and said that he think he will be happier with another woman who can match his sex drive. He said he was sorry for asking me to be okay with one sided open relationship, it was very cruel and selfish of him. 

So my whole life has changed. I was a sahm now I have to go back to work, I will only see my son half the time, he will probably have a step mother eventually.

My marriage before last week was very good for me despite the challenges. I used to wake up to coffee and breakfast my husband made us, then I would take care of my son. Breastfeed him, bathe him, massage him and put him to sleep. It was exhausting work but I found so much satisfaction in it.

Now its all gone. I will have to go back to work, I hated my job, my co-workers were toxic. My son will go to daycare now. I guess millions of people send their kids to daycare but still.

For last week, I haven't slept that well, I feel like shit. I have no appetite. I told that to my husband and he said to give it time and I will feel better.

1o56c9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1o56c9e/that_summer/,That Summer,"
A cold, clear autumn night.
I drift toward the humid haze of a summer past.
They called it the hottest in memory.
We shuffled through baked streets
Alive with noise—
Children laughing as they leapt
Into frigid waters, seeking relief.

Dark eyes found mine
Across sweltering rooms
Laced with drunken laughter.
And passion bloomed—
Brighter than any flower
That season dared to offer.

We tossed and turned in the stifling dark,
Bodies intertwined, glazed in sweat,
Panting.
The heat outside barely noticed—
It was nothing
Compared to what bloomed between us.

The sweetest fruit
I consumed greedily
As a whimper slipped from your lips.
The press of your skin on that unbearable night
Gave more relief than the iciest of pools.

Our connection rooted deep—
Like the oaks we lay beneath
In the golden morning,
Tasting coffee on each other’s lips,
Gazing into eyes
Brown like bark kissed by sun.

Your scent—
More intoxicating than any summer breeze.
Your hair
Spilling like honey
Across the dew-laced grass.

In the depths of such a summer,
There was only skin, breath, and now—
The future did not exist.

Years passed.
With quieter summers,
Each one missing a piece
I didn’t know I’d given away.

I reached for warmth
In strangers’ sheets—
Numb bodies, brief relief,
Their names forgotten by morning.

I drank to silence the echoes,
Swallowed smoke
Just to blur the edges of your absence.
But you were always just beneath it—
A flame I couldn’t snuff out.

Now I lie
Alone and shivering
Beneath a brittle October sky,
Stars like cold reminders.

I think of the child
We chose not to meet—
Too young, too afraid,
And maybe, deep down,
Already knowing we were borrowed time.

Still—
I feel the heat
Of that vanished summer
Flicker beneath my skin.

Always

A ghost I don’t chase anymore,
But sleep beside.

Some nights,
it still whispers me awake.

1o56bay,https://www.reddit.com/r/fforde/comments/1o56bay/sam_the_musician/,Sam the Musician,"[Four years ago, give or take. Sam would be in her early twenties at this point.]

Sam stands behind the counter at County Line Records. She's kind of new, but been around long enough to feel  comfortable running the shop on her own with confidence.

There are one or two people milling about in the shop. An older guy flipping through grunge records. A teenager with a Doobie Brothers record tucked under her arm. The moment is nice, but so many moments blend together.

She looks up and realizes the old man and the young girl are gone. She pushes the cash register shut. She was running on auto pilot. She reorients herself after being a little lost for a moment that consisted of so much more than just the music playing over head.

She taps her finger on the counter and eyes the people in the shop. New faces. Some familiar. She wonders what music speaks to them. Each and every person, she knows had a song that in that moment their heart needs to hear. She absent mindedly hums in time with the music, one octive down.

It's not a boring day, but it's unmemorable, and before Sam knows it, it's 6pm, closing time.

---

Sam flips the sign to CLOSED and locks the door behind the last customer, a middle-aged woman who'd spent twenty minutes deciding between two Joni Mitchell albums before buying neither. The quiet settles in, punctuated only by the faint hum of the overhead lights and whatever's playing through the speakers. Mazzy Star, she thinks. ""Fade Into You.""

She moves through the closing routine on muscle memory, her mind wandering. She doesn't pay attention as she counts the register, straightening the display near the window, or returns a handful of records to their proper bins. Her hands know the work. Her mind drifts.

It's been a good day. Or at least, not a bad one. The kind where time disappears into vinyl, small talk and the endless, comforting presence of other people's music. But now, standing in the empty shop with the day behind her, she feels the weight of it. The safety of it.

The tap on the glass startles her.

Hazel's face appears in the window, framed by the dim glow of the streetlights beginning to flicker on. She's holding two paper cups and wearing a grin. 

Sam unlocks the door.

""Hey,"" Hazel says, stepping inside and handing her one of the cups. ""Figured you could use this.""

Sam takes it, tea, not coffee, and the warmth seeps into her palms. ""You didn't have to.""

""I know."" Hazel glances around the shop, taking it in the way she always does, like she's cataloging details for a sketch she might never draw. ""You almost done?""

""Just about."" Sam gestures vaguely toward the back. ""Give me five?""

Hazel nods, already drifting toward the folk section, her sketchpad tucked under one arm.

Sam finishes up quickly, turning off the lights section by section until only the glow from the street outside remains. When she returns, Hazel's standing near the door, patient and unhurried.

""So,"" Sam says, pulling on her jacket. ""What's the plan?""

Hazel's smile tilts just slightly. ""Grab a drink?""

""Sure,"" Sam locks the door behind them, pocketing the key. ""Where?""

""There's a place,"" Hazel says, already turning down the sidewalk. ""The Crescent Moon. You'll like it.""

Sam follows, falling into step beside Hazel. They don't talk much as they walk, they never have needed to, but the silence feels good. Grounding. Comfortable. Like the world can wait a little longer before asking anything of her.

---

Sam and Hazel continue to walk in that comfortable silence. Hazels eyes darting around every now and then capturing her surrounding, her finger tapping the edge of her sketch book absent mindedly. 

Sam hums quietly as they walk, it's not anything in particular, but a bit of it captures the chorus of Come Sail Away and Sam giggles to herself. Hazel clocks it, but doesn't mention it.  She knows it's not for her, but it's not *not* for her. Sam and Hazel glance at each other briefly and exchange a smile.

As they continue to walk, Hazel notices a young woman with a paint speckled shirt. Another artist. She hums to herself without melody, Sam laughs and nudges Hazel with her shoulder in mock offense. 

After another block, Hazel says softly, ""you have your guitar,""  glancing at it, slung across Sam's back.

Sam shrugs, ""you have your sketch pad.""

""Yeah... but you have your guitar.""

Sam explains she had cracked the neck, had it repaired and picked it up over lunch. Hazel just nods.

""This place is a little hipstery,"" Hazel warns. The wind blows, fall is well under way, leaves turning, some of the turning leaves in the trees, some already fallen.

---

The Crescent Moon sits tucked between a vintage bookstore and a plant shop, easy to miss if you don't know it's there. The sign above the door is hand-painted—a crescent moon, surrounded by stars that look like they were added by someone with more enthusiasm than precision. It's imperfection gives it charm.

Hazel pushes the door open and Sam follows her in.
The warmth hits first. Not just temperature, but the kind of warmth that comes from too many bodies in too small a space, from conversation layered over conversation, from string lights that cast everything in amber. The walls are deep indigo, almost navy, with almost imperceptible constellation maps someone clearly spent hours painting. Potted plant dangle from the ceiling, ferns and pothos trailing down like they're trying to reach the mismatched furniture below. There are velvet armchairs in burgundy and forest green, a worn leather couch that's seen better decades.

There's a small stage in the corner, barely elevated, with a Persian rug and a few floor cushions scattered around it. Right now it's empty, just a microphone stand and a single stool catching the glow from an Edison bulb overhead.

""Told you,"" Hazel murmurs, already scanning for a spot to sit.

Sam adjusts the guitar strap on her shoulder, suddenly hyperaware of it. A few people glance her way. Not staring, just noticing her, and Sam forces herself to admit that it's more in hger head than anything. It's just a guitar. People carry guitars.

They find a table near the back, far enough from the stage that Sam can breathe. Hazel drops her sketchpad on the table and settles into her chair and Sam sits across, letting the guitar rest against the wall beside her.

A server appears. She's in her early twenties, nose ring, flannel shirt rolled to the elbows. ""What can I get you?""

""Whatever's on tap?"" Hazel asks, not expecting an answer, just a drink.

Sam hesitates, then nods. ""Same.""

The server disappears into the crowd, and Sam lets herself take it all in. The place is busy but not packed. Most people are clustered in small groups, conversations low and unhurried. Someone laughs near the bar. A couple in the corner leans close over a shared basket of fries.

It's nice. The kind of place that doesn't demand anything from you.

Hazel's already pulled her sketchpad closer, her pencil moving in small, absent strokes. Not drawing anything specific yet, just letting muscle memory do the work. Sam watches her for a moment, appreciating the comfort in having a drink with a friend without expectation. ""You come here a lot?"" Sam asks.

""Sometimes."" Hazel doesn't look up. ""Good light in the afternoons. Quiet enough to think.""

The server returns with two bottles, not drafts, setting them down with a question of, ""anything else?"" Both girls wordlessly shake their heads. Sam wraps her hands around the glass, the cold of the glass against her palms. She takes a sip and it's decent, something amber and slightly hoppy, not too bitter.

Hazel glances up, meeting her eyes. ""Long day?""

""Not really."" Sam shrugs. ""They all kind of blend together, you know?""

Hazel nods, like she understands exactly what that means. And maybe she does. They sit in the quiet for a moment, the noise of the bar filling the space where words don't need to.

---

""I just..."" Sam starts. She takes a sip of her beer. The room bustles, a quiet background hum of conversation. But Sam has no words.

Hazel looks up at Sam, and tilts her head, laying her pencil down.

""We're twenty five, Hazel..."" Sam's words carry weight. She takes another sip of beer. 

Hazel nods, ""twenty five, and still alive."" 

Sam nods. Hazel takes a sip of beer as the server drops off a fruit and cheese board that Hazel doesn't remember Sam ordering. Then pops a grape in her mouth.

""Who'd you draw?"" Sam asks. Hazel spins her sketch book around. It's the girl in the corner leaning over a psychology text book nursing a glass of wine. A black leather jacket draped over the back of her chair. Looking at the sketch, Sam murmurs, ""she looks distraught."" 

Hazel shrugs. ""Not distraught. Just not found yet, maybe?"" The sketch illustrates the point better than Hazel's words.

---

Sam studies the sketch. The girl's posture is as as if she's folding into herself to concentrate, or maybe to hide. The wine glass sits untouched beside the textbook. Hazel captured something in the tilt of the girls head, the way her fingers press against her temple. and a distance in her eyes. A kind of searching.

""Yeah,"" Sam says quietly. ""Not found yet.""

She takes another sip of beer, then reaches for a piece of cheese. It surprisingly complements the beer well and it does it's job of grounding her back in the moment. Around them, the bar continues its low hum. Laughter from the couple near the window, the clink of glasses at the bar, someone's phone buzzing insistently until they silence it.

""You ever feel like..."" Sam starts again, then stops. She picks at the label on her beer bottle. ""Like you're just... waiting? For something to click?""

Hazel considers this, her eyes drifting back to her sketch. ""All the time,"" she says. ""That's why I draw. Helps me see things before they click.""

Sam nods. That makes sense. Music does something similar for her, or at least it used to, back when she played more. Back before she found refuge in her routine. Even in the record shop, she is surrounded by everyone else's music.

Her eyes drift to her guitar, propped against the wall. The repair shop did good work—you can barely see the seam where the crack was. She hasn't even played it yet. Just picked it up over lunch, paid the bill, carried it back to work. She smiles softly, glad she had the work done.

""Can I see it?"" Hazel asks, following her gaze.

Sam hesitates, then reaches for the guitar. She holds it in mock performace feeling silly, her fingers finding the neck automatically though. She strums once, softly, adjusting the tuning, not really thinking about it.

A few people glance over. Not many. Just enough to make Sam's shoulders tense slightly.

""How's it sound?"" Hazel asks.

Sam plays a simple progression, nothing fancy, just testing. The sound feels clean and warm, no buzzing from the repaired crack. Better than before, actually. She didn't realize how much that crack had been dampening the tone until now.

""Good,"" she murmurs. ""Really good.""

She plays a few more chords, letting her fingers remember the shapes. D to A to Bm to G. The opening to something she can't quite place. Her thumb brushes the strings in a gentle rhythm, and for a moment the noise of the bar fades just slightly, like the music is carving out a small pocket of space just for her.

Then someone near the stage laughs loudly and the moment breaks. Sam stops playing, lowering the guitar back to rest against her knee.

Hazel's watching her quietly, seeing more than Sam realizes she's showing.

""What?"" Sam asks.

Hazel just shakes her head, a small smile pulling at the corner of her mouth. She picks up her pencil again, going back to her sketch.

Sam and Hazel chit chat for a time, sharing drinks. It's easy and light, without expectation. It's conversation about absolutely nothing important but it also feels like the texture of their friendship at the same time. 

The Crescent Moon starts to pick up, more people bustling around. At one point Hazel again takes note of the girl in the corner with the text book and black jacket. ""It's almost like she has each foot in two different worlds."" Her pencil moves across the page.

It's open mic night, and a few people play, opening the evening. Some good, some bad. One girl, couldn't be over 22 just read a poem and it was kind of sweet and kind of sad and it makes Sam smile. 

Hazels sketching; the both of them continue to chat off and on.

""You're like her you know,"" Hazel says, without looking up.

Sam's confused, and Hazel looks up, ""our psych major over there.""

Sam cocks her head. Hazel shakes her head, frustration in not finding the right words. She flips the pages of her sketch pad back two sheets and turns it to Sam.

It's a sketch of the girl, studying, black jacket at her side, yes. But Hazel captured something in the girls face. Something Sam almost recognizes.

""It's nice,"" Sam says. ""You captured more than just the scene. I don't know how you can pull out what people are hiding in themselves like that. 

Hazel shrugs. ""You can do it too you know."" Sam rolls her eyes, but says nothing.

Hazel puts her pencil down, glances at Sam's guitar and then looks at Sam. ""Sign up. For the open mic night I mean.""

Sam hesitates. Hazel says softly, ""just do it Samantha, you'll be glad you did.""

---

Sam stares at Hazel for a long moment, her heart doing something uncomfortable in her chest. ""I don't know...""

""You don't have to,"" Hazel says, already going back to her sketch. No pressure. No expectation. Just the invitation, left hanging there.

Sam looks toward the small stage. A guy in his thirties is up there now, playing something folky and earnest on an acoustic guitar. He's not bad. Not great either. But the crowd is listening, or at least pretending to, and when he finishes there's genuine applause.

Her hands feel clammy.

""What would I even play?"" Sam asks, more to herself than to Hazel.

Hazel glances up. ""Whatever you want.""

Sam takes a long pull from her beer. It's mostly empty now, just foam clinging to the bottom of the bottle. She sets it down and stands before she can talk herself out of it.

""I'm getting another drink,"" she says.

""Okay,"" Hazel says, but there's something in her expression that makes Sam's stomach flip.

Sam weaves through the crowd toward the bar. There's a small table near the stage with a clipboard and a guy with sleeve tattoos and a beanie managing the sign-up list. She tells herself she's just going to walk past. Get her drink. Go back to the table.

She stops in front of him.

""You playing?"" he asks, nodding at the guitar still slung across her back.

Her mouth is dry. ""Maybe. I don't know.""

""Well, we've got spots open if you want one."" He taps the clipboard. ""Just need a name.""

She hesitates. He waits, patient but not particularly interested. Just another name on a list.

""Sam,"" she hears herself say. ""Sam Belle.""

""Cool."" He writes it down. ""You're up after like... four people. Yeah?""

Four people. That's maybe twenty minutes. Maybe less.

""Yeah,"" she says. ""That works.""

She walks on to the bar in a daze, orders another two beers, and carries them back to the table. Her hands are shaking slightly when she sits down.

Hazel looks up. ""You signed up.""

It's not a question.

""Yeah."" Sam takes a drink. It doesn't help. ""I don't know why I did that.""

""Because you wanted to.""

""I really didn't.""

Hazel just smiles, and goes back to her sketch.

The next performer is a woman in her forties reading more poetry. Apparently that's a a thing. It's ac tually raw and a little uncomfortable, the kind of thing that makes you look away even though you're supposed to be paying attention. Sam's knee bounces under the table. She tries to focus on the poet's words but her mind wanders.

After the poet comes a duo with a ukulele and a tambourine doing some kind of indie folk thing. They're sweet. A little pitchy. The crowd loves them. Sam thinks theire awful, but who's she to argue.

Sam's throat feels tight.

""You okay?"" Hazel asks quietly.

""No."" Sam laughs, but it comes out shaky. ""I think I'm going to throw up.""

""You won't.""

""You don't know that.""

""I do, actually."" Hazel's pencil keeps moving across the page. She's sketching Sam now and Sam can see it from the angle, the curve of her own shoulder, the guitar. Hazel continues, ""you've done scarier things than this.""

""Name one.""

""You showed up to work every day at a job you're good at but doesn't fulfill you. That's pretty scary.""

Sam blinks. She doesn't know what to say to that.

The duo finishes. Applause. The guy with the beanie steps up to the mic, checks his list.

""Alright, next up we've got Sam Belle.""

Sam's heart stops.

Hazel looks at herbut doesn't push. Doesn't pull. Just *there*. Steady. The way she's always been. She's the best kind of friend.

---

Sam's name was called but she has a moment still. She stands, pulls her guitar back onto her back. Nods to the announcer indicating that she's on her way, and he nods back. 

Hazel looks up at Sam. ""Hey, you're Sam Belle. You got nothing to prove.""

Sam nods, clearly anxious. She takes a sip of beer absent mindedly. Hazel smiles but doesn't say anything else. Sam peers at Hazel and then glances at the girl studying in the corner of the bar. Pretending to study. Why here? Does this girl even have an anchor? Does Sam? Sam worries she's just distracting herself, but she also knows that it matters for some reason.

Sam pauses, ""Let me see that sketch again.""

Hazel hesitates, but flips back a few pages to the sketch of the girl in the corner. ""This one?""

Sam nods. She doesn't fully see the way the pieces of herself need to fit together to feel whole, but she sees a glimpse of herself in someone else. In Hazel's sketch. 

Sam hesitates, but after a beat asks,""can I give her your sketch?"" Nodding towards the girl in the corner. Sam doesn't really know why she asked, aside from the fact that sometimes it's important to be felt seen. 

Hazel hesitates, but after a beat nods, actually really liking the idea. ""Of course, Sam."" Hazel tears the page from her sketch book handing it to Sam.

Guitar on her back, Sam walks over to the girl that is pretending to study and slides the sketch of the girl across the table, and says, ""my friend sketched this. It kind of reminded me of myself..."" She pasues, ""if you want it.""

The girl looks confused, studying the sketch, glances over at Hazel, then looking up at Sam. She opens her mouth like she's about to ask something, but Sam is already walking away. The girl looks back down at the sketch of herself, caught in a moment of almost breaking in the best and most terrifying way, and her breath hitches without entirely knowing why.

As she walks, internally Sam curses to herself. ""Stupid. So fucking bad with words. What the hell am I even doing??"" 

As Sam's pace slows nearly to a stop, without thought, her fingers trace the repaired crack in her guitars neck. She exhales, focusing on her breath and glances back to her and Hazel's table. Hazel's pencil is flying across her sketch pad, glancing up at Sam moment to moment for reference. When she catches Sam's gaze though, Hazel drops her penci, grins and gives Sam two thumbs up. Sam laughs softly, rolls her eyes, and shrugs to Hazel. Takes a breath.

Sam adjustes her guitar strap, nods, and says softly to herself, ""fuck it"".

Sam Belle, *the musician*, steps on the tiny little stage with the Persian rug. She is terrified, and it's been such a long time since she's felt so much herself. ",1,1760318138.0,fforde,0,1.0,False

I did not need any narcotics and stopped Tylenol by day 2. The only thing that was super discomforting was the gas pain but mine went away by day 3-4. The first week I was super fatigued and took lots of naps. I do have nausea in the mornings quite frequently but my doctor has advised it’s normal due to internal swelling. Zofran kicks the nausea right out! I only had one bad episode with my wrap so far and it was because I gulped too fast and I felt like my smoothie got stuck, luckily it passed after 5 minutes but it was pretty scary because I didn’t know if I was going to throw up, choke, or what would happen. Definitely will be more careful with my sips. I’m on soft foods now and I haven’t had any issues really, I do miss regular food though lol. I have my post op in two days but so far I’m really glad I did this!

1o56ag5,https://i.redd.it/vtp8ohz35suf1.png,"The US dollar is predicted to depreciate another 10% next year, after already depreciating 11% in the first half of 2025.","**The US dollar is predicted to depreciate another 10% next year, after already depreciating 11% in the first half of 2025.**

But what does it mean for you?

**Here’s what you should know:**

The U.S. dollar just had its worst first half of a year since 1973, losing 11% of its value.

Morgan Stanley says it could drop another 10% by the end of 2026.

Why?

Slower U.S. growth, falling interest rates, and foreign investors dumping dollar assets.

**The best-case scenario?**

The Fed gets inflation under control, trade deals stabilize things, and the dollar only loses another 5-7% instead of 10%. Your purchasing power shrinks, but not catastrophically.

**The worst-case scenario?**

The dollar keeps falling 10% year after year. Your $100,000 savings becomes worth $70,000 in real purchasing power within three years. Foreign investors dump U.S. assets. Interest rates spike to attract them back. Recession follows.

**Stop keeping all your wealth in dollars. Diversify your currency exposure. Here’s how:**

1) Buy international stocks.

When you own shares of a European or Asian company, you’re indirectly holding foreign currency. If the dollar falls, those stocks go up in dollar terms (even if the company doesn’t grow).

Add international stocks to your portfolio. ETFs like VXUS (global stocks) make it easy.

2) Invest in hard assets.

Gold, real estate, Bitcoin — are things that hold value regardless of what paper currency does.

**Understand what gets more expensive. A weaker dollar means:**

1) International travel costs more. That Europe trip you’ve been planning? Book it now or pay 20% more next year.

2) Imported goods cost more. Electronics, cars, coffee, chocolate — most consumer goods have imported components.

**Take advantage of the upside. A weak dollar helps:**

1) U.S. exporters.

Companies that sell products overseas make more money. Look for stocks like Boeing, Caterpillar, and agricultural companies.

2) Your salary if you work remotely for a foreign company.

Getting paid in euros while living in the U.S.? You just got a 10% raise.

**What else would you add?**

1o568wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1o568wy/hinge_bans_are_now_when_not_if/,Hinge bans are now when not if,"People who are reading this and have never been banned or got their account back after a successful appeal or their hard reset worked, please understand the odds of you being banned (again) are extremely high on this app. Please also understand you will be banned from all of their apps under Match Group. 

The longer you use the app and do not find your forever person, the closer you’re getting to a senseless permanent ban, not closer to finding love. It’s a gamble every day you open it.

(TLDR below: I was banned twice from revenge reports and the second one is sticking. I’ve concluded being on Hinge is just walking on eggshells.)

My story:

I had been hearing about people’s repeat senseless bans and all the revenge reporting on Hinge and trying to be careful. But I had a false sense of safety and thought well I’ve never been banned on anything so I should be fine and that I follow the rules really well. So I’m good I figured. I signed up Oct 2023 and I was banned in May 2024 when a guy asked for my socials and I said I wasn’t comfortable sharing it before a call or meeting, and next thing I got notification I was banned. I appealed and they let me back on but after submitting my ID and that stupid embarrassing email to everyone about you being a fraud. The number of texts I got about that afterward from guys I was getting to know was humiliating and demeaning. 

I thought ok fine that was just this one lame arrogant guy, this won’t happen again. Then last month on a random Sunday I’m relaxing and someone sends a message on Hinge that he’s angry I didn’t respond yet and I thought wow we matched this morning and it’s the weekend and I’ve been doing errands. I didn’t like his impatience and got worried about his anger so I went to unmatch him but he’d already done it same time he sent the message. About 2 hours later I got the second ban. I was shocked and appealed and got the automated rejection of that appeal. 

No clue what crazy thing he said, but I think they don’t want to allow me back because it’s the second one. I was so flabbergasted at how unfair this was I tried every single appeal thing listed. BBB, the CEO DM, the escalation form, repeat support emails. They won’t listen to me or undo it. And they definitely don’t say the reason but I explained how the ban came immediately after that. I’m legit shocked they don’t care despite my repeat pleas and explanation. So at this point I believe it’s because it’s the second ban or that angry guy said something so egregious as the lie.

Here’s what I want to explain. When I got the first ban I was scared to get another ban the entire time between then and my second ban. I stopped really enjoying Hinge and just walking on eggshells mostly. I was so paranoid and not trusting most of the people. I would unmatch a lot “in case” as has been suggested. I never felt like that using another app, but I kept reassuring myself it’ll be fine. No. Banned again. 

Maybe some of you think this is just my experience but I promise you so many stories like mine and this app is a lost cause for all of us who are using it in good faith trying to find love. My profile even said I’m looking for my life partner because I am. I’d love to marry one day. It’s been a very disappointing experience. And if I were you I’d start looking at other apps. I wish I’d stopped using it and went to another app. Now I’m sitting here needlessly banned from all of Match Group and it wasn’t worth my getting back on that second time I’m realizing. It’s not worth it for you either.

People have figured out Hinge bans you automatically from someone’s report and it’s now the place for both genders to abuse that. This is probably the most likely reason you’ll be banned. 

It’s not if you’ll get banned, it’s when. Some asshole person will probably report you because they hate themselves, life, people, everything and you’re the target that day.

Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Sorry this was long, I just had to share my story and make people more aware.

Boycott Hinge and Match Group, go back to Bumble if you need to, go to Coffee Meets Bagel, Facebook Dating, go anywhere else. No one I know got banned from those. Tell everyone. We need a mass exodus. Fuck Match Group. ",5,1760317936.0,SwipeHelper,14,0.86,False

Please be kind, I'm fragile

This has a lot of detail, half to give context and half just to tell someone. Apologies it's long. 

My (F, 27) ex (F, 26) committed suicide two months ago. I found out via a scheduled message from her basically letting me know that she had just died. This was before even the family knew so I kind of just had to freak out by myself for a bit. Included in the message was a ten page document listing ways in which I had hurt her during and after our relationship, which is it's own story in itself. She was really unwell but I didn't realize how badly. The last time I saw her she told me that if she heard I had slept with someone else she would kill herself. I didn't realize she was being serious. 

This initial message was followed closely by another one apologizing for the anger in the first message and saying she would always love me. We had broken up over a year and a half before this and I was in another relationship by this stage.

My ex, myself, and our friend (F, 26) all lived together while me and ex were dating. We were all really close and hung out all the time. After the breakup I became a bit more distant with my friend but we would still see each other at events and be friendly, grab coffee etc. 

During the funeral time we hung out a lot and cried together. She had received one of the automated messages too letting her know my ex had died, no documents or anything just a message saying she loved her and was the best friend she ever had. I lied and said that my message was similar. I didn't want to chance that anything I would say would taint anyone's memories of her. 

A lot of healing happened, and myself and my friend got closer again. However, exactly one week after my ex died, I was sitting at home and got a message *from my ex*. She had scheduled another email. I nearly lost my mind, I had a full on panic attack it weirded me out so much. 

This one was scheduled to forward a message my ex had sent to our friend. It was addressed to the friend, saying that she (ex) had just died. My ex said how my friend was wonderful, a great friend etc. Then at the end of the message it said  ""in a week's time, this message will send to [me]. I want her to have time to cool off before she sees this but I need you to check on her. I don't think her new relationship is healthy. "" And it went on about my new relationship. 

My new relationship is incredibly healthy and so many things about my relationship in the message are wrong but that's not the issue.

My friend knew I was going to get a message from our friend who died a week before and never said anything?? It makes me so angry and I cannot think of a scenario in which I wouldn't have given someone some notice that it would happen. 

The only thing I can think of is that it's a second message like I got and she never saw it? But I don't understand how that would be the case. She wouldn't be the type to have a messy inbox and miss someone like that, I don't know. 

Either way, I just can't even fathom talking to her. I've stopped going to events she will be at and I haven't answered her messages. We live in different areas of a very big city so we would not see each other without trying. I get so angry when I
think that she did not tell me. At the same time I don't want to be angry and it doesn't seem fair to have this strong of a feeling towards her. 

Which is why I'm looking for other voices in the matter, I feel like I'm going crazy trying to balance ""I am angry and this is unfair"" and ""she's grieving too maybe it's not a big deal"". But it feels like at the moment anyway, the feelings are too strong and I don't think I'd even be able to get any words out if I was around her. I'm never going to be outright angry at her or anything, but in my own head I want to know if I'm overreacting for being super angry. 

Hopefully the story makes sense, please let me know if it doesn't. Am I overreacting?? ",1,1760317597.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
