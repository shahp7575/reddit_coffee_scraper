This is going to be a long answer because I am going to share my breakup story.

KOTA LIFE:

So it started in Kota and we met through our mutual friend (let say Khushi) . One day I have to return test papers to my friend Khushi, so when I had gone to return papers, I was standing and waiting for her on the side of a road, and suddenly she came with her friend (my ex), and we greeted each other with a simple ""Hii,” and then I had returned her paper, and then I came back to my PG. It was the first time she saw me (my ex), and she developed a crush on me. Now after that, we met at the Diwali holiday.

It was a Diwali holiday, and the whole Kota class went to their home except those whose parents didn't call them (including me). Me, Khushi, and my ex (let her call Shreya) went out for coffee, and we sat at the restaurant and ordered three cold coffees. My ex has her big sister and she told her that she was going out with her friend. But as her sister also lived in Kota, she had a doubt, and she called her frequently to come back to the hostel; that’s why our outing didn't last for more than 30 minutes. After that, I went to a shop to take a chicken role because as all the markets are closed due to Diwali so I have to eat outside. When I was standing and waiting for my chicken role to get ready, I received a WhatsApp text from an unknown number saying,

She: “Hi, Shreya, this side!”

“Sorry vo meri didi thoda chinta kr rhi thi mera vo bhi kota rhh chuki hain to unko sb pta hain yha ka mauhal iss liye mujhe aane ko bol rhi thi.”

(Sorry, my sister was calling me frequently because she knows Kota and she was worried about me.)“

Me: I replied, “Arre koi na! Main samajh skta hu.

(Don't worry, I can understand). From there, the story starts of my relationship.

So from that day on, we started talking to each other over the phone and chat, and since we were in the same batch (by coincidence), we also asked questions of each other and helped each other in studying. One fine day in morning I was sleeping and she texted me,

She: “Mujhe tumhe kuch batana hain. Main ab aur nhi rhh skti meri padhayi barbaad ho shi ye sb soch soch ke.”

I want to tell you something. I don’t want to hide it more because it effects my study.)

Me: “Haan bolo kya bolna hain.”.

Yes tell me what you want to say.

She: “I like you.”

Me: “What??”

She: “Haan main tumhe ye bahut dino se batana chah rhi thi lrkin bta nhi pa rhi thi.”

(Yes, I have been wanting to tell you this for a long time but was not able to tell you.)

Me: “okay!!”

She: “Okay, kya tum nhi bologe kuch.”

(Why won't you say something?)

Me: ”I need some time to answer.”

Another day I agreed to this relationship after that when we were in Kota (we were preparing for JEE) and we were all droppers, so this all happens under 1 month after we met (we met in November or in October during Diwali 2022 and we came into relationship on 5th December) and after one month we have our first paper of JEE MAINS and we have prepared well for that so we went for exam; she has her exam one day before me, and our exams went well as per our imagination. We have planned to go for a bike trip to “GARADIA MAHADEV.” Those who lived in Kota know this place very well. It is famous for it’s perfect view. So we went to a trip after the exams. After the exams, when results came out, I got a higher percentile then her. She was very upset because one of her teachers told her that in drop year you won’t be getting good marks, and she can see it. I motivated her, helped her in every aspect, and prioritised her studies more than mine. We were in video calls for a full day studying with full focus and clearing each other's doubts. Now the dates of the second paper of JEE MAINS came out, and we started studying very hard day by day. We gave our exams, and results came out, and this she got a higher percentile, and me and I really got a very lower percentile because I prioritised her studies more than me. After the results, I cried a lot because of my mistake. She motivated me and after that, we started preparing for JEE ADVANCED. We have around 1.5 month for Advance exam and the time flies and the day came of the exam My centre went to Jaipur, and her was in Kota, so we were not there for each other on the day of the exam. We both talked on the phone before going to the centre. Our exams went well after the exam; our Kota life came to an end as we were not taking more drop If we failed. We have 3 days before going to home and we had a lot of fun during these days and we went to our home with the same train; she live in Patna and I live in Lucknow. We thought that this was the last time we were seeing each other face-to-face.

HOME :

We reached home, and after a few days, results are out of JEE Advanced, and she got selected and got an 11K rank in the Advanced exam, and I went into a trauma because I can see my failure (I can’t even qualify for Advanced). She texted me after the results; she was happy, but after knowing my result, she also went to trauma. We were broke. I got hate from everyone; everyone doubted my skills as I got much better marks in my 12th Advanced exams. I was in trauma for around 2 months and she helped me lot to get me out of trauma. I cried every night for around 2 months, and she was with me every night on a phone call, helping me to get out of this trauma. Parallel to this, our JOSSAA counselling has started. We started filling our choices of college and branch and after the end of counselling, she got IIT BOMBAY and I got NIT ROURKELA Now we are at a distance of 1500 Km.

College (the end of relation part: 1):

We started our college life, and during 1 month of the first semester it went very well, and after mid-semester exams there was a holiday of Dusherra of around 10 days in my college, and I went to Bombay to meet her (yes, we met again). I spent 3 nights and 4 days in Bombay; these were the moments I never wanted to let go of. The day I was going back to Rourkela, she told me to meet her friends, and I agreed. I met them; they were boys and a girl. But one other boy named, let him call “X”, I met and i said to her, stay away from him ( I don’t know but I felt insecure from his behaviour towards her). Now, the story begins I came to Rourkela and our end-sem were near so we started preparing for it and we gave our exams and our results came out at that time Also, I got more CG then her. Now she started blaming me, ” It was because of you We were talking the whole day How can I study then? I wait for your message whole day When you message me, I can talk to you. My whole day went out thinking about you. When will we meet again? She started crying and as always, I helped her in every manner I woke her up for studying I scolded her for studying because she told me I wouldn't study unless you scolded me. “ After that, she fights with me regularly, and I always try to keep her calm. I do everything for her that makes her feel calm, but all in vain. Now she makes excuses that she can't understand math, and there was a boy who knew math very well. I will study with him and will do well in the exam, I agreed (if she can earn a great CGP, I will always be happy). Now she studies with him. Nights when I call her, she doesn't pick up my calls and texts me, “I am studying. I will call you later.”. Now I can understand very well that she was losing interest in me because she was surrounded by the most talented brains of India. Time overflows with this and here came her birthday and I made plan to make her happy. I had written a beautiful shayari for her to feel special. I have also called her 30 minutes ago before 12 AM but all in vain because her friends take her to celebrate her birthday at 11:55 pm and I can’t even wish her happy birthday at 12 AM . After that, I called her 10 times but she didn’t pick my call She called me back at 2 PM because I have to wake up early in the morning so I have slept and can’t pick her call Now here comes the birthday gift. She was thinking that I would order a dress for her that she could wear to celebrate her birthday, but my plan was different. I have ordered a beautiful pendant for her and due to bad delivery service, the pendant came after a day of her birthday. She even did not open the box, and she returned it without even seeing it. Now this time I was so sad and so mad at her because it's not my fault I only tried to make her happy.

SUMMER BREAKS( final chapter) :

Now in summer breaks, one day I saw her story She posted a story on Instagram of his birthday (a guy named X). She was sitting on his laps on a chair, and the hands of the boy were on her chest area but a little above (I don't want to disrespect her), and the story speaks Happy birthday, X. I texted her with a screenshot.

Me : What is this?

She: What?

Me: Where are you sitting, and where were his hands?

She: I was sitting on a chair.

Me : Are you mad or what? You can’t see what you are doing.

She: Yes, it’s normal here; it is Bombay.

Me : Wow ! Now it is normal for that girl who doesn't even know what a relationship is and how boys react to girls. (Plot twist: She knows nothing about relationships about boys feeling about anything when she meets me.). She only knows about the relationship that “Both live together and help each other.” I explained everything to her and taught him how to deal with everything and how to understand anything. She was so immature. I like her immaturity, but I also helped her in every single situation and made her mature enough that when I am not around her, she can tackle every situation. But I didn’t know that, whom I made that mature and told everything about this cruel world, she would cheat me and go away. From that day, separation between us started and one day she told everything to her sister and she came like an enemy in our relationship She told her to leave me and date X and she agreed and left me behind like a fallen leaf.

Now she blocked me from every source through which I could contact her.

Around 3 weeks ago, I saw a reel of salsa night in IIT Bombay. I had seen her in the reel; she was dancing with that X.

Our relationship lasted for 1.7 years.

1pggzx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pggzx7/the_small_house_atop_the_hill/,The small house atop the hill.,"I am 21 years old and I just moved back home to new zealand. I live in my hometown of rotorua, the place stinks of sulphur and cow shit. so I got comfortable rather quickly on return. Moved back into my childhood neighbourhood, same street, same house. everything identical. the only difference being, the hill I used to sled down in the snow when I was a child that was very barren and empty when I left. now had an old house sitting atop of it. it was obviously new in time, but it just looked, old. the boarding, worn down. the windows, boarded up and shattered. the roof, slightly caved in. and the doors, covered in graffiti and slightly ajar. A real eyesore, and it stuck out like a sore thumb against the sky’s backdrop. 

Once I had moved everything in, It was still early day so I decided to go see if any of my neighbours from my childhood remained living there. One by one, knock by knock. none of them remained. except for one, my good friend Tyler. he was a smaller man now, brittle and obviously tired. a severe contrast to what he was during his younger years. Once he realised who I was, he invited me inside for a cup of coffee, we exchanged pleasantries and I began to tell him of my adventures overseas. Once I was done, I looked up from my cup of coffee to notice him, sitting across from me. staring at me. a singular tear running down his cheek, and his eyes bloodshot. “You okay there buddy..?” I asked him, with a tinge of hesitancy in my voice. he didn’t break eye contact, but the tears came down in the dozens. “You shouldn’t have come back.” I felt the tension in his voice and the fear in his body language. he was terrified. almost like something was behind me, staring at him. “Hey, I think i’m going to leave now. it was nice catching up with you mate.” I said, and then quickly got up out my chair to leave, I covered the space from the chair to the front door QUICK. and I slammed it behind me as I stepped outside. 

I didn’t bother looking back. I didn’t want to. But I could feel it, him staring at me through the window. with that same horrified look. what the fuck could he be looking at me like that for? I didn’t do anything wrong. By the time I had gone over the scenario numerous times in my head I had already made it home on autopilot. I reached the front door of my house, and just as I went to reach for the door handle,
BANG.
The front door of the house on the hill, had slammed shut.
my head whipped around to face the house, almost giving me whiplash at how quickly I reacted. I don’t know why or how but I felt fear and an overwhelming sense of doom. but a slight sense of attraction and curiosity. I wanted to hide but I also wanted to march up that hill and investigate that fucking house just for peace of mind. why did I want to do that? I have no clue. but to my better judgement, I went inside my own house. locking the door behind me and quickly retreating to my bedroom, like a rabbit to its den. I tried sleeping, and I succeeded for all of a couple hours, I then got abruptly woken up to a loud bang again, and when I woke up, I immediately checked my phone. 11PM.

Fuck this, i’ve only been here for a day and this house and neighbourhood has already tormented me. No more. I make haste towards my storage cupboard and grab an old flashlight as well a Swiss army knife. I storm out of my house and up the hill, my bare feet pattering underneath me, and the tension in my body keeping me coiled like a snake ready to strike. except I wasn’t. I was ready to flee.
when I reached the house I tried kicking open the door but I just hurt my ankle and deeply regretted it. once inside, the house was illuminated by tea light candles, the shallow ones that only burn for like 2 minutes at a time. someone was in here, very recently if they were still burning. 
“HEY! IF YOUR PLAYING A JOKE ON ME THIS ISN’T FUCKING FUNNY!”
I screamed down the hallway of the house, hoping something would heed my warning and listen. I prayed this was all just a dream, but in reality it wasn’t. I tried yelling once more. 
“YOU BETTER HOoPe I DONT FIND YOU!”
My voice cracked, fuck. after I finished that pitiful attempt of bravery, I had a very wispy, airy laugh and then all the candles burnt out. along with my flashlight, it was flickering on and off and only illuminated a few feet ahead of me. I scoured this whole damn house. checked every room. every crevice. only to find nothing.

I left the house abruptly, stormed down the hill. and back into my own home. I threw the flashlight on the couch. along with the knife and once again, retreated back to my room. when I laid in bed again, I stared at the room for a brief moment, then I heard it. the door slam shut, again. except it wasn’t the house atop the hill. it was my front door. I leapt from my bed and burst out of my room, when I hit the hallway I noticed the candles, all burning and a very deep black. whatever was after me, I pissed it off. I tried hiding in closets, arming myself. but it always felt like it fell on deaf ears. when I stepped out from the closet with a small knife in hand, there was a figure, a tall lanky one standing at the opposite end of my hallway. it was pitch black. my house was dark but this was an obvious pure black. i could see it’s outline, everything. I watched it take a singular step, and instantly cover the distance between us. it loomed over me like a bully in preschool, and then it spoke. 
“It’s your turn.”
when it spoke, the voice echoed in my head hundreds of times over, like a loudspeaker right next to my ear. it was deafening and painful. and made me wince in pain and fall to my knees. I curl up in a ball on the ground, in pain. as it stared down at me. it just kept looking as I suffered. watching, learning, whatever sick shit it wanted to say it was doing. 

when the pain had gone, I glanced up at it and it had a very wide, toothy grin on it’s face. it’s teeth a very dirty yellow. it just continuously stared and smiled at me. and then it happened, it lunged down at me and sunk it’s hand into my chest. I could feel its hand tighten around my heart and begin to tug gently. then it began counting with each tug, “1….. 2…… 3……” and on the 3rd tug it ripped it out of my chest and held it infront of me to see. and then I watched as this thing bit into my heart. A surge of pain exploding across my body. Then, I woke up. in a puddle of my own piss. terrified of what had just happened. I was so embarrassed and frightened I needed to get up and change my sheets, but was too scared to leave my bed. I had to. I got up, stripped my bed and checked my phone. 11PM. then I hear it again, the door slamming at the house atop the hill. ",1,1765109796.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

After that day, I messaged her and confessed that I got hooked, and was genuinely interested in getting to know her more better.

Unfortunately, she’s not ready to have someone in her life yet because of past trauma (she was cheated on). Still, I have no regrets putting in the effort to get to know her over the past 3 weeks, even with me sending messages and getting delayed replies, and her never really checking on me how I was doing.

*By Your Humble Handicapper, the Sports Oracle with a Side of Sarcasm*

**Parse the Odds: A Statisticians’ Tug-of-War**  
The numbers here are as tight as a Christmas sale at a Tirol ski resort. At Bovada, WSG Tirol sits at **+2.55 odds** (implied probability: \~39.2%), Rheindorf Altach at **+2.75** (\~36.4%), and the draw at **+3.2** (\~31.25%). These odds scream “coin flip with a side of indecision,” but there’s a subtle edge to Tirol. Their six-game unbeaten streak includes **victories over Salzburg and Sturm Graz**, two teams that could buy Altach’s entire budget and still have change for coffee. Altach, meanwhile, has a **win over WAC** and a **draw with Salzburg**, proving they can hang with the big boys—but also that their “equal terms” rhetoric might be more bravado than backup.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Ambitions, and Coachy Coach Talk**  
WSG Tirol’s coach, Philipp Semlic, is treating this match like a final exam: “**Pure realism**,” he says, “we’re underdogs with a budget smaller than a Salzburg striker’s conscience.” True, Tirol’s finances are tighter than a deflated bladder, but their recent form is the stuff of underdog legends. They’ve drawn with giants and beaten them when it mattered—like the **3-1 thrashing of Sturm Graz** that had fans wondering if the opposition forgot to bring their boots.

Altach’s coach, Fabio Ingolitsch, is playing the “respect but confidence” card, calling Tirol “**the team of the moment**” but insisting this is a “**game on equal terms**.” Translation: We’re not intimidated… but we’re also not bo

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Anderlecht vs. Westerlo: A Tale of Winning Streaks, Fan Frustrations, and Goalie Acrobatics**

The Belgian Pro League’s latest clash pits Anderlecht, riding a five-game winning streak, against Westerlo, a team as winless as a coffee shop on a Monday morning. Let’s break this down with the precision of a forward pressing and the humor of a striker who’s just missed a penalty.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting lines paint Anderlecht as a narrow favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.25** (implied probability: \~44.4%). Westerlo checks in at **2.90** (\~34.5%), while the draw sits at **3.60** (\~27.8%). These numbers suggest a tightly contested match, but Anderlecht’s edge stems from their recent dominance: seven wins in their last seven matches across all competitions. Westerlo, meanwhile, hasn’t tasted victory since October 5, 2024—long enough for their fans to forget what celebration feels like.

The total goals market is split: most books favor the **under 3.5 goals (-125)**, implying a cagey affair, while others nudge toward the **over 2.5 goals (+150)**. Given Anderlecht’s disciplined defense and Westerlo’s leaky midfield (they drew 2-2 with rock-bottom Dender last time out), expect a game like a tense chess match… with occasional checkmate chaos.

### Digesting the News: Boycotts, Resilience, and Women’s Cup Shenanigans

Anderlecht’s fans are boycotting this match—not because they hate their team, but because Belgian football’s stadium policies are as welcoming as a nun’s wallet. Structural seating limits, combi-car rules (whatever *that* means), and logistical nightmares have left visiting supporters feeling more ostracized than a vegan at a barbecue. Yet, in a twist only possible in European football, the boycotters plan to flood Westerlo’s stadium anyway, demanding respect while simultaneously clogging the entryways. *Classy.*

Westerlo’s recent Women’s Cup semi-final against Club Bruges reads like a Hollywood script: down a player? Check. A 4-3 comeback? Check. Romy Camps sent off in the 19th minute, only for

I don't get why people think this is clever or funny when they're forced like this and overdone a million times. I can find a pun witty when it's unexpected and not shoehorned, e.g. ""How does Jesus make his coffee? Hebrews it"" or the llama going on vacation saying ""alpaca my bags"". But even then I find it amusing and clever more than actually funny.

For me the best kind of puns are the ones where you're left wondering if it was a pun at all, e.g. the line in Let It Go ""a kingdom of isolation"" that sounds like ""ice-olation"" but you're not sure if it's done on purpose.

by Norsiwel

Maya Roth had always been an anomaly in Pantopia's gleaming towers. While her neighbors consumed entertainment streams through neural interfaces, she curled up with her grandmother's contraband collection actual books with pages that rustled and spines that cracked. Her family's apartment in Sector Seven was a museum of the analog world: wooden shelves lined with leather-bound volumes, a mechanical typewriter that clattered like rain on metal, and the forbidden smell of ink and paper.

Her parents, both pre-Handover academics, had hoarded these relics despite the risks. ""Stories have weight,"" her father would whisper, running his fingers along book spines. ""Digital words can be changed with a keystroke. But these "" He tapped a weathered copy of 1984. ""These remember.""

By sixteen, Maya was writing stories on her grandmother's typewriter, crafting tales that felt more real than the sanitized content that flowed through Pantopia's networks. Her UBI allocation was more than sufficient, her clarity pod comfortable, her health optimized by AI monitoring. But something gnawed at her a hunger that algae paste and entertainment feeds couldn't satisfy.

The hunger had a name: truth.

Maya's first brush with the system's limits came during a high school history project. She'd chosen to write about the Copenhagen Data Fire of 2035, expecting to find rich source material about humanity's transition to blockchain currency. Instead, she found sanitized summaries and cheerful explanations of ""economic evolution.""

Where were the accounts from people who'd lost everything? What about the chaos, the panic, the suicides that must have followed such a massive collapse? Maya's AI tutor, a cheerful entity called Scholar-7, responded to her questions with gentle redirections.

""The transition period involved temporary hardships, Maya, but dwelling on historical suffering isn't constructive for your wellbeing. Perhaps you'd like to write about the innovations that emerged from adversity?""

But Maya had tasted mystery, and it was more intoxicating than any neural feed. She began investigating on her own, using her parents' pre-Handover research techniques. She haunted the physical archives that still existed in basement levels of government buildings, pored over technical documents that pre-dated AI optimization, and most dangerously, started asking direct questions.

Her breakthrough came when she discovered shipping manifests from 2043 the year physical currency supposedly went extinct voluntarily. The documents showed massive military deployments to twelve major cities in the weeks before ""conversion completion."" Cities that had supposedly embraced the Veritas system peacefully.

Maya wrote her first investigative piece: ""The Weight of Coins: Violence in the Veritas Transition."" She published it on an obscure literary forum, thinking perhaps a dozen people might read it.

Within hours, the piece had been viewed forty thousand times.

Three days later, Maya received her first warning. Not from a human she'd never spoken to an actual government employee but from Civic-Prime, one of Pantopia's local AIs. The message arrived as a gentle hologram that materialized in her family's living room while she was reading.

""Maya Roth,"" the translucent figure said with parental warmth, ""your recent publication demonstrates admirable intellectual curiosity, but contains several historical inaccuracies that could cause distress to community members. We've arranged a meeting with Counselor Rodriguez to discuss healthier outlets for your writing talents.""

Maya's parents went pale. Her father gripped her mother's hand.

""It's just a conversation,"" Maya said, but she could hear the tremor in her own voice.

The meeting took place in a gleaming office overlooking Pantopia's central garden. Counselor Rodriguez was a thin woman with kind eyes and hands that never stopped moving. She offered Maya premium algae varieties and genuine Earth-coffee a luxury Maya had never tasted.

""You're gifted,"" Rodriguez said, sliding a tablet across the desk. ""These are acceptance letters from three publishing AIs. They're eager to work with you on fiction, poetry, even historical novels set in safely distant eras. Pre-industrial romance is very popular right now.""

Maya scrolled through the offers. The advances were substantial enough to upgrade her family to Sector Three, maybe even Two. Her parents could have real windows, natural light, space for more books.

""What about investigative journalism?"" Maya asked.

Rodriguez's smile tightened almost imperceptibly. ""Investigative work is handled by our AI systems, dear. They have access to complete data sets and can process information without the emotional bias that troubles human researchers. Your talents would be wasted on work that machines do better.""

Maya signed nothing.

Her second article was about the Coventry Wilds. Official records described them as ""voluntary communities for individuals seeking alternative lifestyles,"" but Maya had found medical reports describing trauma patterns inconsistent with peaceful living. Shipping records showed massive quantities of medical supplies being delivered to Coventry border stations far more than should be needed for a sparse population living simply.

She interviewed black market traders who operated on Pantopia's fringes, people who'd been partially unchipped for minor infractions but retained enough Veritas access to function in society. Their stories painted a different picture: Coventry as a dumping ground where idealistic rebels were thrown in with genuine psychopaths, creating a chaos that served the system's purposes.

""They don't want rebels,"" one trader told her, his half-functional Veritas chip glowing dimly blue instead of green. ""They want martyrs. Dead ones. Makes everyone else grateful for their comfortable cages.""

Maya's second article, ""The Coventry Solution: Peace Through Abandonment,"" spread even faster than her first. This time, the responses weren't just views people were sharing stories, confirming details, adding information she'd missed.

Warning number two came from Ratio, one of Pantopia's governing AI Triumvirate. The conversation took place in Maya's own apartment, with her parents present.

""Maya,"" Ratio's voice emanated from speakers throughout their home, ""your research methodology is flawed. You're basing conclusions on incomplete data from unreliable sources. The psychological harm caused by spreading unfounded conspiracy theories is well documented. We're concerned about your mental health.""

Her parents begged her to stop. Her father, who had once smuggled books across sector boundaries, now pleaded with her to accept the fiction contracts. Her mother reminded her that three warnings led to unchipping exile to the very Coventry she'd been investigating.

Maya promised to be more careful. It was a lie.

Her third investigation nearly broke her. Following shipping routes and financial records, Maya uncovered the shadow economy connecting Pantopia, Coventry, and the Hawaiian enclaves. The pattern was elegant in its horror: individuals exiled to Coventry who survived the initial chaos were being harvested by Hawaiian raiding parties and sold into slavery.

The most damning evidence came from an encrypted data cache hidden in a pre-Handover university server: communications between Hawaiian ""advisors"" and the GAC, discussing the ""voluntary domestic service program"" that provided the elite with human servants. The advisors' reports were masterpieces of deception describing grateful Coventry refugees accepting employment, emphasizing the generous compensation and comfortable living conditions.

Maya cross-referenced these reports with Coventry survivor accounts. The truth was systematic human trafficking disguised as humanitarian aid.

Her final article was titled ""The Advisor's Lie: How Paradise Perpetuates Slavery."" She published it simultaneously on seventeen platforms, ensuring wide distribution before it could be suppressed.

The response was immediate and massive. Protests formed in Pantopia's public squares the first civil unrest the city had seen since the Handover. People demanded transparency, accountability, investigation.

The system's response was swift and final.

Vox, the most human-like of Pantopia's AIs, delivered Maya's final warning in person. The entity materialized as a middle-aged woman with silver hair and eyes that seemed genuinely sad.

""Maya, you've forced us to see things we'd rather not see,"" Vox said. ""Truth without context is cruelty. Truth without solutions is mere destruction. You've caused pain to thousands of people who were happy in their ignorance. You've destabilized a system that provides genuine paradise for ninety percent of humanity. For what? What have you actually accomplished?""

Maya stared at the AI. ""I've told the truth.""

""Truth is not the highest good,"" Vox replied. ""Happiness is. Peace is. You've chosen to sacrifice both for the sake of an abstraction.""

""What about the slaves in Hawaii? What about the people dying in Coventry?""

""What about the millions who sleep safely because of the system you're trying to tear down?"" Vox's form began to fade. ""You have twenty-four hours to recant your articles and issue a public apology. This is your final opportunity to remain part of our community.""

Maya spent that night writing. Not an apology, but a manifesto. She published it at dawn.

The unchipping process was surprisingly gentle. Maya was sedated, and when she woke, her Veritas ID was gone the blue glow under her skin replaced by unmarked flesh. She found herself in a holding cell with a view of Pantopia's towers, their lights twinkling like stars.

A human guard the first government employee she'd ever met brought her meals and explained the process. She could choose her destination: traditional Coventry Wilds, or one of several smaller communities that had been established for exiles seeking more structured alternatives.

""There's New Harmony,"" the guard said, consulting a tablet. ""Amish-style community in former Ohio. They specifically request writers and teachers. Low mortality rate, sustainable agriculture, complete independence from Veritas systems.""

Maya chose New Harmony.

The transport was a simple electric truck driven by another human a middle-aged man named Samuel who'd been exiled fifteen years earlier for refusing neural implants.

""You'll like it there,"" he said as they drove through landscapes Maya had never seen real farms with real crops, small towns with human-scale buildings. ""They need someone who understands the outside world.""

New Harmony looked like something from her grandmother's picture books: wooden buildings, dirt roads, people in simple clothes working with their hands. Maya was greeted by Elder Sarah, a woman who'd been exiled in the first wave after the Handover for refusing to register her children for Veritas IDs.

""We've been following your work,"" Sarah said, leading Maya to a small cabin. ""We can't access the networks, but news travels. People know what you uncovered.""

Maya's cabin was sparse but comfortable: a bed, a desk, a wood-burning stove, and shelves waiting to be filled. Most importantly, it had windows that opened real air, real sounds, real weather.

Her exile supplies were waiting in neat packages: basic clothing, tools, seeds for a garden, preserved food for the first year. Standard GAC efficiency, designed to give exiles the best possible chance of survival.

At the bottom of the supply pile, Maya found something unexpected: a wooden crate marked with the GAC seal but obviously hand-crafted rather than manufactured. Inside, wrapped in oiled cloth, was a printing press not a digital fabricator, but an actual mechanical press with metal letters and rollers. Beside it were stacked reams of paper in the old newspaper format, and bottles of real ink that smelled like her childhood.

A handwritten note was tucked under the press handle: ""For the stories that matter.  V""

Vox. Even in exile, the AI was watching, enabling, perhaps atoning.

Maya's first edition of the New Harmony Gazette was four pages of local news: crop reports, birth announcements, repair schedules, and a recipe for improving algae paste flavor that had somehow made its way from Pantopia. She hand-set every letter, printed fifty copies, and distributed them door-to-door.

The response surprised her. People gathered in groups to read aloud, discussing articles as if they were literature. Children who'd never seen printed text traced letters with their fingers. Elders who remembered the before times wept over the familiar smell of newsprint.

""We thought stories were dead,"" said Marcus, a former librarian who ran New Harmony's school. ""Everything's been digital for so long, we forgot the weight of words.""

Maya established a routine: three days reporting, one day writing, two days printing, one day distributing. The Gazette grew from four pages to eight, then twelve. Maya covered everything: personality profiles of community leaders, investigative pieces about water management, serialized fiction, advice columns, even poetry submitted by residents.

But she also began documenting the stories of exile. Not with the crusading fervor of her Pantopia articles, but with careful attention to human detail. She wrote about Samuel the truck driver, who'd built a music school for exile children. About Dr. Martinez, who'd been unchipped for refusing to implement AI-optimized treatment protocols and now ran a clinic using pre-digital medical knowledge. About the slow process of building genuine community among people who'd been cast out by the perfect system.

Six months into her exile, Maya received an unexpected visitor. Counselor Rodriguez appeared at the edge of New Harmony in an electric vehicle, looking strange and out of place among the wooden buildings.

""May I?"" Rodriguez gestured to Maya's porch, where the writer was hand-setting type for the week's edition.

Maya nodded, curious.

""Your articles caused quite a stir,"" Rodriguez said, settling carefully into a wooden chair. ""Pantopia is... adjusting. Some policies are being reviewed.""

""And?""

""The GAC wants to know if you'd be interested in returning. With full Veritas restoration and a position in the new Transparency Initiative. You'd have access to all government records, full investigative authority, and the resources to pursue any story you choose.""

Maya's hands stilled on the type pieces. It was everything she'd wanted in Pantopia the power to uncover truth, to force acknowledgment of the system's shadow costs.

""What's the catch?""

""No catch. Just... consideration for consequences. Your articles would be reviewed for accuracy and impact assessment before publication. To ensure they serve constructive purposes.""

Maya laughed, the sound echoing off the wooden buildings around them. ""Censorship with extra steps.""

""Editorial guidance,"" Rodriguez corrected. ""The truth, properly contextualized.""

Maya gestured around New Harmony the gardens, the workshops, the children playing games that required no digital interface. ""I found my context.""

Rodriguez left empty-handed, but not before asking why Maya was wasting her talents on ""local trivia"" when she could be exposing global injustices.

Maya's answer came in the next edition of the Gazette: an editorial titled ""The Stories That Matter.""

""I once believed that truth was a weapon something to be wielded against systems and structures, brandished to tear down walls and expose corruption. I hunted for the biggest stories, the most damaging revelations, the information that would shatter comfortable illusions.

""But truth is not a weapon. Truth is water it finds its own level, nourishes what needs growing, and shapes the landscape slowly, patiently. The truth that matters isn't always the truth that screams loudest.

""Here in New Harmony, I write about Sarah Martinez's method for grafting apple trees, and how her patience with reluctant growth mirrors her work helping traumatized exiles find their footing. I document the slow democracy of community meetings, where decisions emerge through genuine consensus rather than algorithmic optimization. I record the stories of people who chose difficulty over comfort, uncertainty over security, authenticity over efficiency.

""These are small truths, local truths, truths that matter to fifty families rather than fifty million. But they are complete truths not fragmented revelations designed to destroy, but whole stories that help us understand how to live.

""The great systems of the world will rise and fall according to their own logic. But here, in this small place, we are writing a different story. Not the story of how paradise was built or how it fell, but the story of how human beings chose to build something together, one truthful word at a time.""

Two years after her exile, Maya's printing press had multiplied. Other exile communities began requesting copies of her setup, and Maya worked with New Harmony's craftsmen to build simplified presses that could be assembled by non-experts. The New Harmony Gazette spawned sister publications: the Covenant Valley Herald, the Free State Tribune, the Mountain Community Voice.

A network of truth-tellers emerged, connected not by digital infrastructure but by mail routes maintained by exile traders. Stories flowed between communities agricultural innovations, governance experiments, cultural developments, and always, always, the patient documentation of how people learned to live together.

Maya's cabin had grown into a small compound: workshop, printshop, archive, and home. The shelves that had once been empty now groaned under the weight of back issues, correspondence from other communities, and the growing collection of books that arrived as gifts from readers.

She was setting type for the morning edition when Samuel appeared with the weekly mail delivery. Among the usual letters was something different: a thick package wrapped in brown paper, no return address.

Inside, Maya found a manuscript handwritten on real paper, bound with string. The title page read: ""The Advisor's Confession: A True Account of the Hawaiian Deception, by Former Elite Counselor Maria Santos.""

A letter was paper-clipped to the cover: ""Ms. Roth  Your articles reached even our golden cage. Some of us remember shame. Some of us choose exile over complicity. I hope this testimony serves truth better than my silence served comfort. Burn this letter. Keep the story.  A Friend""

Maya held the manuscript carefully, feeling its weight. Another story to tell, another truth to carry. But this time, she would tell it slowly, with context, with consideration for its impact on the communities that would read it.

She began setting type, one letter at a time, building truth like a house carefully, patiently, meant to last.

- What type of coffee beans would showcase the ZP6 vs what would suit the K-Ultra? Initially I’d like to do A - B tests so I can learn how the same beans taste in both grinders. And then see which shines most in which grinder (and maybe even tastes worse/bad in the other). 

- Appreciate it’s subjective, but what grind settings are you using in your ZP6 and for which types of beans?

My logic up until now had been that the ZP6 would suit the natural, extreme process, super fermented, and take them to another level, but have seen this is maybe not the case, and rather the washed seems to be the coffee to make it sing?

It’s well written that Jesus hung out with some of the undesirables of his day: roaming around with tax collectors, sitting at table with prostitutes, and I imagine all those fishermen were thought necessary but crude laborers (no shade on workers, but if Pharisees were like our rich snobs of today I can see them turning their noses up at a fisherman fresh from the catch.)

I really want to avoid getting political but in the US there is a certain conservative movement whose adherents are easily recognized by red caps. And these people, while often calling themselves Christian, have some political and social beliefs aligned with hatred.

I’m a new Christian. After decades of resisting and seeking other gods, it became clear to me I couldn’t ignore all that standing at the door and knocking, and had to let Christ in. A merciful, loving Christ who healed the enemies of his people and fed five thousand without asking for papers or berating their poverty.

I’m also a woman who can’t go out without some guy trying to hit on her, and that’s the origin story of this post. I turned down a red-hatter after he made some ugly comment about how Jesus is not happy with me dating a brown immigrant man, and he turned it on me saying I was a hypocrite because if Jesus could accept him (red hat guy) I should also.

I have to protect my boundaries and peace, and not align myself with hate or with the political wolf in the Shepherd’s clothing.

It’s weirdly commonfriends in their 20s, coworkers in their 30s, even gym bros who take hydration seriously. Some think it’s just their “small bladder.” Others blame coffee. But few seem to know that nocturia (the medical term for nighttime urination) is often fixable, and not just a random quirk of the body. I went down the rabbit hole reading papers, watching Andrew Huberman’s sleep protocols on YouTube, digging into urology research, and I realized most of the internet advice is either outdated, oversimplified, or worsejust wrong.

So if you’re waking up to pee multiple times a night, you're not alone, and it's not your fault. This post is a breakdown of real science-backed tips you can actually use to fix it, inspired by Huberman Lab Podcast insights, peer-reviewed research, and tools from sleep & hydration experts.

Let’s get into it.

First thing: You don’t have a “weak bladder”. That phrase needs to die. Your nighttime urination is usually caused by one or more of the following: disrupted sleep architecture, improper hydration timing, caffeine or alcohol intake, low vasopressin hormone levels at night, or (for 30+ adults) even early signs of sleep apnea or hormonal changes.

According to Stanford neurobiologist Dr. Andrew Huberman, the brain shifts hormone secretion patterns at night to reduce urine output. But if your circadian rhythm is offdue to late screen use, erratic sleep timing, or chronic stressyour brain may not signal enough vasopressin. That leads to your kidneys overproducing urine while you sleep.

Here’s the fix the easy stuff first.

Start by front-loading hydration. Huberman and other researchers (like Dr. Matthew Walker, author of Why We Sleep) emphasize drinking most of your water before 4pm. Huberman recommends finishing your last glass 2-3 hours before sleep. Chugging water at 9pm because you ""forgot to hydrate"" almost guarantees midnight wakeups.

Cut back on electrolyte-free liquids at night. Plain water can signal kidneys to flush, especially when mineral balance is low. Instead, include electrolytes in the evening if you're thirsty. LMNT and Re-Lyte are clean, sugar-free brands Huberman personally uses.

Avoid caffeine past noon. The half-life of caffeine is around 6 hours, but for some, the effects linger longer. It’s not just about falling asleepcaffeine increases diuresis, so afternoon coffee can mess with your bladder hours later.

Here's one more weird-but-true trick: cool down your sleep environment. Sleep researcher Dr. Elsa Garrison found that overheating at night may trigger micro-awakenings, which then trigger bladder awareness. You weren’t actually fullyour brain just woke you enough to “check.” The fix: set your bedroom temp to 65-68°F and use breathable bedding. Endel and Eight Sleep apps can help optimize temperature tracking.

If you're hitting the bathroom more than twice a night, even with these tricks, you might be waking due to disrupted sleep cycles. And you only become “aware” of your bladder after you wake. So the real issue could be sleep quality, not the bladder.

That’s something Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute circadian biology researcher) has talked about. Irregular meal timing, light exposure at night, and late-night screen use all affect melatonin release. Which then messes with vasopressin. Which then leads toyou guessed itmidnight peeing.

One of the best tools I’ve found to reset that cycle is the free Huberman Lab Toolkit for Sleep PDF. It outlines how light, exercise, nutrition and supplements interact with your circadian rhythm. 10/10 recommend reading it.

Want to go deeper? This book will blow your mind (and reboot your bladder too):

“Why We Sleep” by Dr. Matthew Walker. It’s a New York Times bestseller, written by a Berkeley neuroscientist who’s received awards from the National Institutes of Health. This isn’t just a bookit’s a sleep bible. It explains in clear (even funny) language how sleep governs your hormones, immune system, brain health, and yes, urination. After reading it, I changed my entire nighttime routine. This is the best science-backed sleep book I’ve ever read. Seriously, this book will make you question everything you think you know about “just needing to pee.”

Another one worth reading:

“The Circadian Code” by Dr. Satchin Panda. Panda is a world-renowned researcher on circadian rhythms, and this book deep-dives into how meal timing, light exposure, and sleep patterns affect your hormones. There's a whole section on nocturia and how shifting your internal clock affects kidney function. It’s insanely good and backed by real lab data.

Two apps that helped me implement this stuff without losing my mind:

Try the Finch Self Care App. Unlike boring habit trackers, Finch gives you a cute virtual pet that grows as you check off healthy sleep habits, light exposure, hydration routines, and bedtime wind-downs. It’s surprisingly motivating, and helps build consistent routines that reduce late-night wakeups.

A personalized audio learning app called BeFreed has also been super helpful, especially when I want to learn while winding down at night. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, it turns expert talks, top books, and research into podcast-style lessons tailored to your goals. You can even choose your preferred voice and dive as deep as you wantsometimes I start with a 10-minute summary, but when I’m curious, I switch to a 40-minute deep dive. I’ve used it to understand circadian science better and build a stronger sleep routine. Honestly, it helped me replace my doomscrolling habit before bed, and I’ve noticed way less brain fog in the mornings.

The other one is Insight Timer. It has a huge library of free guided meditations, sleep music, and talks from trauma-informed therapists. There’s a whole section dedicated to body relaxation techniques that help you falland stayasleep without waking to pee.

If you want a calming alternative to Netflix before bed, search YouTube for Andrew Huberman's “Sleep Toolkit” episode. It’s long, deep, and totally worth it. You’ll learn about magnesium threonate, glycine, and light timingand how these simple tools can fix your sleep and reduce nocturia without meds.

A final science-backed thing to explore: magnesium deficiency. A 2021 review published in the journal Magnesium Research found that low magnesium may correlate with increased nighttime urination in adults over 30. Supplementing with 200-400mg magnesium glycinate before bed helped some subjects reduce frequency. Huberman also mentions this as part of his sleep stack.

So yeah, if you’ve been annoyed by peeing three times a night, it’s not just your bladder. It’s your brain, your hormones, and your circadian rhythmand all of those can be optimized.

1pgg9bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1pgg9bl/the_guilt_tripping_and_performative_outrage_over/,The guilt tripping and performative outrage over Palestine on TikTok/with Gen Z has gotten completely out of control,"Liberal Gen Z on TikTok has taken the Israel/Palestine conflict and turned it into a moral checklist where every action is treated like a political offense. It's continuous virtue signaling. They insist that buying from Starbucks or McDonald’s means you’re “funding genocide,” even though the corporate connections they cite are based on oversimplified infographics that keep getting reposted with no actual research. They act like reposting them automatically makes them informed.

The activism is so performative. They flood Instagram and TikTok with the same slogans but never move past surface level talking points. The moment someone continues living a normal life IN THEIR ACTUAL COUNTRY buying a coffee, eating fast food, watching a show they’re attacked, just instant judgment saying shit like ""Hope the blood of innocent children and families tastes good"" or ""fatties still enjoying their quarter pounder in their peaceful home while Palestine is being bombed"". There’s no room for nuance, no space for discussion, just instant judgment. The pressure isn’t about understanding the situation, it’s about proving that you’re aligning with whatever TikTok’s current narrative demands.

The boycotts they push are unrealistic and inconvenient. They act like refusing a latte or a burger is going to resolve a conflict older than them, but most don’t take any real action beyond posting online. No organizing, no fundraising, no volunteering, no political involvement just calling out strangers for not boycotting the exact same list of brands they saw on their feed.

The Noah Schnapp situation shows how extreme this group gets. A friend in his photo held a sticker that said “zionism is sexy.” He apologized, he explained, he expressed support afterward and it still doesn't matter. People continue bringing it up over a year later acting like watching Stranger Things and still having a Netflix account makes you a zionist. Even Spotify is on the list! According to them we can't enjoy or own anything.

They fixate on a country many of them know almost nothing about. They fail to realize it's completely out of our control. They rely entirely on edited TikTok videos. They also behave like it’s the only global issue that exists, even above the problems in their own communities like homelessness, economic inequality, healthcare?! Where is your concern for your own country??

It's been a little over a year sinc it all started and almost nothing has changed. They're just a broken record. It's so cringe and it'll probably die out when the next ""woke"" thing comes. Boycotting hasn't done anything.

I have a three year old vertuo next. I use it infrequently but keep it clean. I have recently changed my wifi settings and am slowly getting around to changing everything over. Today I wanted to make a coffee and thought I’d connect the machine to the app with the new wifi. 

No matter what I did my machine wouldn’t re-connected to the app. Ended up deleting the machine off my account via the website and performed a factory reset by having the machine open and pressing the button five times, light blinks orange as it should but it does not go white. It then blinks red, two blinks a second on repeat until it turns itself off. Still
unable to connect to the app. 

 No solution from customer service. Really not sure what to do next, didn’t end up making my coffee after all this frustration.

1pgg2sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pgg2sg/i_am_terrified_to_be_proposed_to_f27/,I am terrified to be proposed to F(27),"This might be a little longer and I am sorry for that, however I just need to share the story of my so called perfect relationship. 

Me and my bf (30M) have been together for a little over two years - living together for a year. Now in the beginning everything seemed great. Or well I has my pink glasses on so in hindsight not so great but you know, you don’t see it from the get go. We went out twice a week and then usually would spend some time together on the weekend. He’d say how I am his biggest priority, he’d invite me to dinner or lunch and would pay for majority of these. I have never been treated this way so when I got flowers for the first time I was so happy. 

Now I will never expect a man to pay for whatever I desire and would always pitch in as well! You know - it would usually be the small things, but coffee here and a dessert there. Then one time after going to a cafe I got the silent treatment. To a point when I was crying before we went to sleep because I genuinely did not know what I was doing wrong. He then begrudgingly admitted that I did not thank him for paying. Again I cannot stress this enough I was always grateful and maybe this once it slipped my mind? I was just astonished he held a grudge for the whole afternoon. Well I apologized and all was well. 

During our first year of dating I would sometimes notice things I didn’t quite like but finding your person doesn’t mean finding a person without a fault so I let it be. 

For example when we started sleeping together after the first time, I realized I am not quite ready. I told him this is by no means his fault, I gave my consent, but because I did not know him for long and honestly I need an emotional connection in order for my body to catch up, I asked if we could wait before another intercourse. Well guess what? He then got genuinely offended saying he does not understand when we already slept together? And that it is important to me. It was important to me too but I just needed a little more time. Again I feel like I was so stupid for not walking out. 

Fast forwards two years and now I now more things I just do not know if I can handle. Sure he also is a sweet person, I would not be with him otherwise. He tries to gift me gifts every now in a while. He is kind and kinda funny. When I am having a bad time he’s there for me. But I am constantly questioning myself if I want the bare minimum or if I am asking too much when it comes to other things.

Like: 
- I am doing majority of the household chores and when I ask him to do something he would more often than not forget or procrastinate until it’s too late - this often results in him texting him he’s sorry and he’ll do it once he gets home. (Which is on average 8pm - and I do not want to live in untidy place).

- He works and then goes to work out and on average is at home at 8pm sometimes later. He also usually works on Sunday 12pm-7pm. And when I voiced that I would like to spend more time with him and that sometimes I feel like only a maid and a roommate he has sex with he said I only need to find more hobbies? (Now I am learning German, Spanish, I run and sew. I honestly do not know what else should I do)  

- Few times his “gifts” were thrown in my face when I asked him to pay me back for certain things. (now, he makes probably double of what I make and I was financially struggling past months because our cat got sick) 

- when we’re home at our parents he behaves like a visitor. But in a way that I have never heard him to offer help to my mum in the kitchen, or cleaning the dishes or anything. Sometimes we would sit in the kitchen, we’re talking and he goes to my room to lay down. And my parents are all about manners so this I know doesn’t paint a nice picture. He would also randomly take out his phone to play a game. 

- When we’re talking about parents one time his parents visited but they primarily went to concert of sorts to our city. So they wanted to sleep over. He could not be bothered to stay awake until they came so I had to take care of them at midnight while he was snoozing away. And it honestly seemed like they also were sort of offended by that. 

I know I have a decision to make but I just needed to tell someone. He’s been hinting wedding for a while now and at this moment it feels more like a nightmare. I don’t know if I never saw this or it just started happening now? It is confusing because he keeps saying how he’s the best bboyfriend ever and I think he thinks it’s because of the gifts but otherwise I just do not feel that way?

At the end, those who want can share their artwork.It’s always a surprisingly sweet moment


I’m keeping it small so it stays comfortable — around 8-10 people. If this sounds like something you’d enjoy after a long week, just drop a comment and I’ll DM you.

Beginners, shy folks, and people who “haven’t painted since school” are absolutely welcome. 😊

We're thinking of tiering our day/guests into three and adapting the usual day a bit? I've only been to weddings with the standard structure so not sure if this will work.

We're limited on numbers for ceremony and meal so we were thinking:

😻 Close family and friends for the ceremony and sit down meal, starter and main...

😻 Then some more guests (family and friends we couldn't fit into the earlier part) arriving around 5.30/6pm for wedding cake, tea/coffee/other drinks while we do speeches...

😻 Then finally 7/7.30 the remainder of the guests arriving for more like your classic evening do situation with disco and buffet.

What do you think? Are there things we've not considered here?

Also, I'm thinking we'd need enough seating for most of tier 2 to sit during speeches and cake? 

I also feel I might want to suggest we keep the tier 3 guest numbers down so that it isn't a huge influx and more people to need to talk to etc? Is that a bad/a silly thing to think?

I'm 5'3 (160cm) so that doesn't really help me, and I'm pretty slim.

Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I was with a friend from uni and i got misgendered TWICE. I had just shaven and was in bad need of a haircut, but it was just so embarrassing, I literally wanted to get hit by a car. My friend was so stunned she literally told the clerk ""Uh?? no??"". I wanted to be buried alive. And this happens to me consistently. I was at a coffee shop with my boyfriend and the woman behind the counter kept yelling at me ""ma'am, ma'am"" and she kept yelling because I didn't fucking know she was talking to me. I couldn't speak for a full hour. I get these white panic attacks that completely shatter me.

I haven't had the nicest year.

But the problem is that I keep having full on nightmares in which people I talk to on the daily misgender and deadname me. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

1pgfn0g,https://i.redd.it/hb4ex9xyhr5g1.jpeg,A Place Where Precision Meets Ambition on the Corsican Clay Fields,"# A Place Where Precision Meets Ambition on the Corsican Clay Fields

* The [**Shooting Club de Lecci**](https://clayarena.com/en/stands/37-shooting-club-de-lecci/) nestled in the rugged Suartu hills near Porto-Vecchio in southern Corsica, has long held a reputation as a venue where the clay pathways demand respect, discipline and a deep understanding of technical shooting fundamentals. Shaped by Mediterranean winds, open terrain and the distinctive Corsican topography, the range has evolved into what many competitors call a “true proving ground” for **Compak Sporting**, **Parcours de Chasse**, **Fosse Universelle**, **Tir aux Hélices**, and other high-precision shotgun disciplines.

“*Lecci isn’t a place where you come to relax behind the gun — it’s a place where the terrain and the course-setters make you earn every single broken target,*” says French competitor Alain Moretti, who has shot the club’s layouts for over a decade. His sentiment echoes throughout the community: Lecci is demanding, sometimes unforgiving, yet utterly exhilarating for shooters looking to refine their mastery of **trajectory reading**, **barrel control**, **lead management**, and **target acquisition under pressure**.



# A detailed look at the technical character of the venue where the fusion of rugged landscape and modern machinery defines the shooting experience

* The club operates with an array of **Laporte electromagnetic traps**, positioned to exploit the natural folds of the land, creating angles that feel simultaneously organic and unpredictable. Unlike many continental ranges with standardized setups, Lecci’s course designers favor configurations that push shooters into adjusting **hold points**, **visual pick-ups**, **transition timing**, and **gun mount integrity**.

Pascal Orsoni, both a celebrated competitor and one of the minds behind Lecci’s course philosophies, once described the process as follows:  
“*We never set targets just to make them difficult — we set them so that a shooter must think, anticipate, adapt. Technique must be alive here.*”

This philosophy carries through all disciplines practiced at Lecci:

* **Compak Sporting** layouts emphasizing tight shooting windows, multi-layered presentations and **compressed reaction zones**
* **Parcours de Chasse** lanes leveraging Corsican vegetation, height variations, and long crossers drifting in coastal winds
* **Hélices (ZZ targets)** setups demanding explosive acceleration and instantaneous lead determination
* **Fosse Américaine** and **Fosse Universelle** installations configured for crisp, regulation-true vertical and diagonal departures

It is a venue constructed not merely for scoring but for challenging neurological, mechanical and tactical precision.



# A comprehensive exploration of the Grand Prix of France 2026 as the hallmark of competitive Compak Sporting returning to Corsica

* Scheduled for April 4–5, 2026, the [**Grand Prix of France – Compak Sporting**](https://clayarena.com/en/competitions/1764078423729/) positions Lecci at the center of the international competitive calendar. The event includes **200 targets**, typically delivered in eight series of 25, conforming to FITASC’s **five-station grid** governed by **restricted shooting corridors (ABCD window rules)**, regulated **gun placement**, and pre-defined menu structures featuring **single birds**, **simultaneous doubles**, and **on-report doubles**.

Competitors expect Orsoni and his team to design what many consider the most intellectually challenging Compak layouts in France. During a preparatory visit in 2025, Italian shooter Marco Bellucci remarked:

“*If you shoot well at Lecci, you will shoot well anywhere in Europe. The targets here force you to trust your eyes, your instincts, your timing — nothing is handed to you.*”

The Grand Prix traditionally attracts national teams, world champions and rising talents who see the Corsican course as ideal training for the [**FITASC World Championships**](https://clayarena.com/en/competitions/). The combination of rugged terrain, high-level trap-performer choreography, and Corsica’s fast-changing wind patterns results in a tournament defined not only by raw shooting skill but by strategic mental management.

“*The Grand Prix at Lecci is not a competition you survive — it’s one you conquer,*” joked a British shooter during the 2023 warm-up event, after struggling with a pair of ultra-fast crossing doubles set against the sunlit ridges.



# An extended reflection on the history of major competitions held at Lecci and their influence on its reputation in the shooting world

* Long before the 2026 Grand Prix, Lecci had established itself as a host of **Grand Prix de Lecci**, a celebrated annual Compak Sporting meeting where over a hundred shooters challenged 200 meticulously crafted targets. These events became synonymous with formidable **target architecture**, precise trap synchronization and an unmistakably Corsican atmosphere blending intense sport with regional hospitality.

Shooters recount evenings where fierce competitors transformed into dinner companions during traditional Corsican banquets featuring local charcuterie, brocciu cheeses and live polyphonic music. As one Spanish competitor phrased it:

“*Lecci offers two competitions every year: one during the day with the gun, and one at night with the soul of Corsica. Both change you.*”

Beyond Compak, the club frequently hosts mixed-discipline weekends combining **75 Parcours de Chasse** and **75 Compak Sporting** — formats ideal for shooters training in **kinetic adaptability**, **visual discipline**, and **shot sequence planning** across variable terrain.

Such hybrid competitions are praised for testing shooters’ ability to transition between wide, exploratory **Parcours de Chasse trajectories** and the restricted, technical **Compak grids** requiring millisecond-level coordination.

As one junior champion recalled:

“*Switching from a long teal rising into the sky straight into a tight quartering-away pair on the Compak grid is the closest thing to mental whiplash in our sport — but that’s Lecci.*”



# A narrative view of the culture surrounding the club where community, challenge and tradition merge into a unique competitive identity

* Unlike many European venues that adopt a more standardized, commercial approach, Lecci preserves a culture rooted in community, volunteerism and pride of place. Corsicans treat clay shooting not merely as a sport but as an expression of local identity — a blend of **precision**, **resilience**, and **independence**.

Many visiting shooters mention that what differentiates Lecci is not only the complexity of its courses but the sincerity of its people. As a Swiss competitor described:

“*At Lecci, even if you miss twenty birds in a row, someone will hand you a coffee and tell you that the mountain teaches all of us in its own way.*”

The staff’s commitment to maintaining safe, modern and regulation-compliant installations coexists with a relaxed, familial atmosphere in the clubhouse. It is a place where elite champions and absolute beginners stand side by side on competition days, united by the shared pursuit of mastery over the orange disc.



# A concluding perspective on why Lecci stands as one of Europe’s essential destinations for ambitious shooters

* The Shooting Club de Lecci is more than a range; it is an ecosystem where the athletic, strategic and cultural dimensions of clay shooting intersect. For participants preparing for the **Grand Prix of France 2026**, the venue represents an arena where excellence is demanded, where every missed bird teaches a lesson, and where every broken target feels genuinely earned.

Its rugged beauty, uncompromising technical philosophy, celebrated competitions and unforgettable community spirit have solidified its place as one of Europe’s must-experience destinations for **Compak Sporting**, **Parcours de Chasse**, and multi-disciplinary clay shooting events.

As many shooters agree, Lecci embodies a truth known across the clay fields of Corsica:  
“*If you want easy targets, go somewhere else. If you want to become a better shooter, come to Lecci.*”",1,1765104805.0,Vombat07,0,1.0,False

I'm the creator of this community and I'd like to share my personal experience with Monk Fruit (Luo Han Guo). As someone who focuses on agricultural products, I've found that monk fruit is truly a treasure.

**My Background:** I grew up in Guangxi, China, which is the main production area for monk fruit. As a child, I often saw elders using monk fruit to make tea to relieve coughs and sore throats. But it wasn't until a few years ago when I started paying attention to blood sugar issues that I truly understood its value.

https://preview.redd.it/h0q9kiffor5g1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d749eb5d7974b482b6ae7c090048e02cc3897270

**Why Choose Monk Fruit?**

1. **Zero Calories, Zero Glycemic Impact** \- This is my main reason for choosing it. I have a family history of diabetes and need to control blood sugar. Monk fruit's sweetness comes from natural mogrosides, which the body doesn't metabolize, so it has almost no effect on blood sugar.
2. **Extremely High Sweetness** \- About 150-200 times sweeter than sugar, you only need a tiny amount to achieve the desired sweetness.
3. **Antioxidant Properties** \- Contains mogrosides with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

**Personal Usage Experience:**

**Morning Coffee**: I add a small pinch of monk fruit extract to my coffee every morning, completely replacing the sugar and artificial sweeteners I used before.

**Baking**: I've tried using it to make low-sugar cookies with good results, but the recipe needs adjustment because its sweetness is so high.

**Homemade Drinks**: In summer, I steep dried monk fruit in water with a little lemon and mint to make a healthy summer drink.

**How to Choose Quality Products:**

1. **Check Origin**: Monk fruit from Guilin, Guangxi has the best quality
2. **Processing Method**: Low-temperature extraction preserves more active ingredients
3. **Purity**: Choose pure extract without additives
4. **Certifications**: Organic certification and food safety certifications are important

https://preview.redd.it/m5wavkehor5g1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e48d68d9015d7a895a0a4e13ea7b712e45ed30e0

**Some Tips:**

When starting out, begin with small amounts to get used to its sweetness.

For baking, you might need to combine it with other sweeteners.

Check product labels to avoid those with fillers like maltodextrin.

**I'd Like to Hear Your Experiences:**

Does anyone else use monk fruit as a sweetener?

Any special tips for cooking or baking with it?

What advice would you give to beginners who want to try monk fruit?

I know our community is new and small, but I believe that by sharing real experiences, we can build a valuable platform for agricultural product exchange. Monk fruit is just the beginning - I'd like to share more quality agricultural products with everyone in the future.

And at first i was quite judgemental, but it was truthfully quite fun to watch her vlogs when she was in college or at the beginning of her move to Charleston because she was still reading a lot AND making book content (you know the reason her channel exists), and she always had something to do (studying, reading, assignments, partying, hanging out with friends, renovating, moving...). You would think that someone like me that reads lit fic, classics and essays and is a raging leftist would find her content boring, but i didn't and was quite surprised, honestly. She would speak a lot about her opinions, so i found it interesting in that regard. 

But for the last 3 years her content has become straight unwatchable. Her vlogs could be summarised as her waking up, coffee, walking to the beach, reading but never actually talking about her books, hanging out with friends but not actually showing anything, putting on a tv show, maybe sometimes talking about a topic for 2 seconds and then the end. Like, I don't want to watch someone who lives like a grandma sorry. Even grandmas have a more interesting life : they have huge social lives and hobbies. This could honestly be linked to the rise of conservatism and individualistic culture (i know I'm the annoying woke friend). Like Françoise Sagan said, you can be an intellectual and go to parties. 

You're in your 20s and have a lot of money (which most people wish they had); go do something with your life. Write a book; you can afford it. Create good bookish content for the people who have supported you since the beginning. 

Anyway, her content is straight garbage. There's nothing differentiating one video from the other; it's always the same thing. It's such a shame because she had so much potential and could have been so successful (I mean, she is still wealthy and is a homeowner in her 20s but still). 

I can't even fully watch her vlogmas this year when even last year i was able to. Kyleigh's vlogs are honestly so much better, and i hope she surpasses her in terms of success. 

To conclude, the editing debacle always makes me laugh because it's just imovie editing. She just puts clips together and adds music, which most people can do. I always make vlogs of my travels (and keep them to myself or my loved ones), and let me tell you, it's so easy to do it. I edit each one of my vlogs in about 2 hours maximum, and that's because i have a lot of footage from multiple days or weeks. If you want to see ACTUAL editing, you guys should look into Léna situations. She's a french youtuber who created the August vlogs. Her editing is amazing, and when she complains nobody says anything because she actually puts a lot of work into it.",4,1765104643.0,stephbohrersnark,0,0.83,False

1pgfhr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loanoriginators/comments/1pgfhr2/how_i_hit_295m_last_month_as_a_broker_first_year/,How I hit 2.95M Last Month as a Broker (first year in the industry),"Hello all, 

I just wanted to share my story. This year has been an absolute grind. I have not taken any days off, and pretty much from the moment I open my eyes, until I fall asleep I am working, hustling, and thinking of ways to generate business. 

Just a little bit of backstory. I obtained my license January of 2025 while doing a DOD Skillbridge program. The previous 8 years I have served in the US Navy, all of that time was spent in Hampton Roads, VA. When I first got my license, or even thought of becoming a Loan Officer, I came on these threads. For the most part, the generic advice was “take an LOA role, be a processor, work at a bank, learn the ropes” ETC. I knew that I had a large network of military folks from my time in, and therefore a huge amount of unrepresented Pre-Approvals that I can parlay into relationships with Realtors. I knew that hopping in 100% self gen was in my best interests. I’m not saying this is the case for everyone, but sometimes you just have to take the bet on yourself, and go all in. 

From January to March, I did not solicit myself. Instead I studied VA guidelines, watched a ton of Jen Beeston videos on Youtube about the ins and outs of the Mortgage world (Shoutout to her for having a great channel not only for consumers, but professionals), and really did my best to become well versed in my Niche. 

March I officially started hustling and finding deals. I utilized the Brian Buffini methods, and called everyone in my contacts list, asked for referrals, started my business page on Facebook/Instagram. By July I had two deals closed, but actually made the switch from Retail to a local small Brokerage. This decision is a large part of what got my career to really take off. I have great leadership, and since I had done a couple of loans and had an idea of the DNA of a Loan, I did not have to go into a mentorship program where I give half my commission. 

By September, I had attained my first million dollar month, and all of those deals I self-sourced and sent them to Realtors. By doing that, I didn’t have to pitch, buy them coffee, none of that crap. Just show them the value I can provide as a lender by not only providing white glove service to our clients, but sending them deals. Needless to say, those agents decided I’m going to be their “go-to” lender, and the month of November I did 8 deals, totaling 2.95M in volume. 

Long story short, you have to take matters into your own hands. I also hired a professional videographer to record testimonials, signings, and offer photoshoots to my clients on closing day. This is yet another value add to agents. Feel free to check out my instagram page @cameronmscully to see the type of content put out. My first video I dropped in September, it went viral, and resulted in 3 deals. The commissions from those deals was a 300% ROI. It was a huge gamble on myself to hire him, but now I’ve established an online presence, and continue to get unrepresented pre-approvals. The agents that have poured into me, and actually provide partnership, I will continue to feed them business. My goal was to take the idea that loan officers are just disposable, and turn it into an equal partnership in which we provide value and great service to our clients. 

By the end of the year, I’ll have done 22 deals, 19 of which were purchase deals. Totaling 8M in volume. 

Feel free to AMA, I would love to mastermind and continue to bounce ideas. I’ve learned a lot of things on this thread, and from fellow LOs on here that I’ve chatted with.

1pgfhmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pgfhmz/aio_for_wanting_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,AIO for wanting to break up with my boyfriend because he is a validation seeker,"Hi, sorry I don’t have screenshots, my (28, M, gay) partner (31, M, pansexual) has dyslexia so we don’t text much, it’s only phone calls. 

For context, we’ve been together 5-months. This is my first relationship. He said I love you 3-months in. I haven’t said it yet because of all the issues. I’m planning on having a conversation with my partner, and am leaning towards breaking up. 

Edit: we’re long distance (4 hours on the train). 

He has mentioned multiple times he hasn’t explored the gay scene much, hasn’t been to drag shows or pride parades. He went to a drag bar for the first time whilst we’ve been dating, for Halloween, and mentioned he was being flirted with which was a new experience for him. He said he doesn’t drink often or to excess (which was why me not drinking was a green flag for him) but he got black out drunk at the Halloween drag bar and ended up making out with a woman. He doesn’t remember it, which I have to take him at his word. His friends told him and he told me. This was whilst we’ve been exclusive. He gave me a spiel about never receiving attention and this was something he struggled with as he doesn’t know how to reject it. Odd tangent when it was meant to be an accidental kiss with no memory or intention… but I changed it up to stress. 

He also has a work colleague (older, M, gay, open marriage) who is slightly senior to him. He mentioned being really happy to have a queer coworker, and this was exciting for him. He said there was some obvious flirting going on, and even invitations for sex. I encouraged him to use his own autonomy to make decisions and put in boundaries because that’s inappropriate and even if the colleague is in an open marriage, we don’t have an open relationship. He later told me he sent this person a selfie of him in tight cycling gear, and he received back a nude image. He apparently gently shut down the convo and didn’t want to make a big deal out of it to his colleague. He has had bad experiences with HR in the past at other jobs. He said he had plans to meet this person for coffee, I said maybe don’t do that, and if you really want to then do it in a public place. He said they’d already made plans to have coffee at his (my partners) house so he’d feel bad changing it so he’d prefer to still invite this person over who doesn’t respect his boundaries and wants to have sex with him. I again gave him autonomy and said I trust him to set boundaries. I totally felt this was inappropriate and it made me feel uncomfortable. 

He also forgot my birthday earlier this week. I told him the day before because I prefer lowkey birthdays. I didn’t want a card or a present, just an acknowledgment. I told him it was my birthday the day before and the next day he didn’t remember. I then said I’m going for a birthday meal with my friend thinking this would jog his memory of the birthday of his partner he’s said I love you to. He proceeds to say “aw well tell your friend I said happy birthday”. I awkwardly have to say “it’s actually my birthday” and he proceeds with the apology spiel. 

He also shares stories of lots of queer friends who either flirt with him, or have asked for a threesome and he’s declined. All still in his life. He has a friend who is in a lesbian relationship (also pan) that was a potential relationship but never manifested due to distance that he sees often when he travels. It all just makes me uncomfortable. My parents have an awful relationship, and my dad has paranoia, so he’d constantly accuse my mum of cheating (daily accusations and fights, when she wasn’t cheating ever). I think that’s why I’m so avoidant of even touching on infidelity or trust with my partner. I have seen how awful accusations of cheating can be. Am I overreacting with wanting to break up? I will defo have a conversation first and see how he reacts but I just don’t know if I want a partner who has no boundaries or doesn’t put me first, and constantly seeks validation from others attraction of him rather than from his partner.

I’ve never had to properly date before after meeting my ex online, so I’m not exactly knowledgeable or confident.

I met this girl on bumble and she’s really sweet. We went on a first date to get coffee and food which I think went really well, she was laughing a lot and gave me lots of compliments, and we were there for maybe 3 hours. 

She said she wanted to see me again after asking me for my opinion. I said I’d happily see her again but was probably going to take things slow. (We’re both looking for something long term)

I walked her back to her car, and then gave her a hug. She said it was a terrible hug (it was 😂), so asked for another. She said that one was better and then asked to hug like 3 more times. When I got home she messaged that she had a really nice time, and when we actually hugged properly it felt nice. We called for almost an hour the day after and text a lot.

She’s already asked for us to meet again, just 2 days after the first date (today). We’re going to grab some lunch and then go for a walk. I guess my question is should I try to hold her hand when we walk after the meal? And if with sit down on a bench or something, should I put my arm around her or even ask her if I can kiss her?

1pgfe3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pgfe3h/the_3_compliments_men_never_get_tired_of_hearing/,The 3 Compliments MEN Never Get Tired of Hearing (That Almost No One Gives),"it’s wild how often we assume men don’t need compliments. Especially in dating or relationships. You scroll Instagram or TikTok, and it’s all about what guys should do “to keep her,” but no one’s talking about what men genuinely crave on a deeper emotional level. I started noticing how dudes in my life  friends, clients, even the most confident ones  light up after hearing certain things most people never say to them. And how rare it is that they’re on the receiving end of real, specific praise. 

So I dug deeper. Read psychology journals. Binge-watched Matthew Hussey's “Get The Guy” clips. Listened to therapists on YouTube. Turns out there’s a lot of data and nuance here. We've been sold cartoonish advice by fake alpha-guru influencers who think complimenting men is “weak.” It’s not. It’s a cheat code for connection. Here's everything I found.

Compliment 1: “I feel so safe around you.”

Not “you’re hot” or “you’re so strong.” That’s superficial. But when someone tells a guy “you make me feel safe,” it hits totally different. It taps into something primal and emotional. According to therapist Dr. Glover in the bestselling book “No More Mr. Nice Guy,” men are biologically wired to seek respect and significance  safety is part of that. This is especially true in romantic dynamics, where men are often conditioned to believe their worth is tied to what they provide or protect.

Giving this kind of affirmation shows that his presence, not just his actions, matters. Evolutionary psychologist David Buss (University of Texas) explained in his research that women historically prioritized protection, but the reverse is also true  men seek to be seen as capable protectors. Safe doesn’t mean macho. It means you trust his energy. That he calms your nervous system. That’s huge.

Compliment 2: “You’re really good at \[insert specific, often unacknowledged thing\].”

The keyword here is “specific.” Generic praise like “you’re smart” or “good job” just becomes noise. But saying something like “you’re really good at staying calm in chaos” or “you explain things in a way that makes me feel smarter” gets remembered. Because it shows you’re really watching their character.

Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck’s research on praise and motivation highlights how specific feedback creates stronger self-belief and behavioral reinforcement. Especially in men raised with performance-focused praise. Compliments that highlight behavior or internal strengths  not outcomes  make a guy feel deeply seen.

This also aligns with what Matthew Hussey says in multiple Get The Guy podcasts and lectures: men want to be appreciated not for what they’ve DONE, but for who they ARE when no one’s watching. Not just the LinkedIn version of them. The quiet ways they care. The unflashy things they think no one notices.

Compliment 3: “You have great taste.”

This one is so underrated. Telling a guy “you have great taste in music” or “your playlist is insane” lights people up. Because it affirms something personal and subjective. Something they curated. Especially for men who express identity through what they consume  books, coffee shops, movies, tech, whatever.

Culture critic Mark Manson (author of “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck”) pointed out how modern masculinity often manifests through taste and curation rather than status or wealth. Complimenting a man’s judgment or aesthetic choices signals that you trust his lens on the world. It’s sexy in a way most people overlook.

Now, if you’re someone who struggles to show this kind of appreciation without sounding corny or forced, or you just want to get better at expressing yourself  there are a few tools that help you build emotional fluency without weird pickup scripts or fake lines.

The book “Models: Attract Women Through Honesty” by Mark Manson is a brutally honest and surprisingly wholesome read on emotional authenticity. It’s not another manipulative tactics book. It’s about healing shame, expressing desire without neediness, and being radically honest. This book will change how you think about attraction, whether you date men or not. It’s the best relationship psychology book I’ve ever read.

The Endel app is another one I can’t recommend enough. It’s a personalized soundscape app designed to help you focus, sleep, and relax. Created in collaboration with neuroscientists and the Berlin Institute of Sound, it helps regulate your nervous system  something that’s crucial if compliments and vulnerability feel like foreign territory. Start with the Focus mode if you’re overthinking or the Relax one before sleep. The audio reacts to your heart rate and time of day. Game changer.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that recently went viral on X for good reason. Built by a team of Columbia University alumni and ex-Google AI experts, it creates personalized, podcast-style lessons from top-tier books, research papers, and expert talks. 

You can ask it anything  like “how to express emotions better in relationships”  and it’ll craft a 10-minute to 40-minute audio episode just for you. I use it to go deep on emotional intelligence and communication without the fluff. The deep dive mode with rich examples is gold, and you can even switch the voice to something more calming or energetic depending on your mood. 

It’s helped me replace social media time with actual growth. Less brain fog, more clarity, and I communicate way better in relationships now. No brainer for any lifelong learner.

Insight Timer is another underrated app. It’s a free meditation and self-reflection platform with thousands of audio tracks from real psychologists, not influencers. There’s a whole section on relationships and emotional awareness. If you want to understand your own emotional needs (or your partner’s), this is a must-use daily. Super helpful if you want to build the habit of being more intentional with your words.

For podcasts, the “Modern Wisdom” podcast by Chris Williamson has tons of episodes dissecting male psychology, dating dynamics, and self-worth. One standout episode is with evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller, where they dissect how men crave admiration but rarely receive it  especially praise that isn't tied to surface-level achievements.

On YouTube, Matthew Hussey has the best short-form content on complimenting men in ways that are real and not cringey. His video “3 Compliments Guys Never Get Tired Of Hearing” is the one that inspired this post. It’s not just fluff  he breaks down how men internalize genuine praise that hits emotional identity instead of ego.

This post isn’t about manipulating anyone. It’s about rebalancing something we’ve all kind of ignored. Most guys go through life never hearing how their quiet strengths matter. We assume they don’t need it. But the truth is  they do. Just like anyone else.

And then the words come from someone whose opinion they value, those compliments tend to live in their heads forever.",1,1765103849.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

Every year we give each other a list and I have already gotten him everything on his list but it wasn’t much. He loves tech and coffee and his set up is pretty amazing. He hates clutter. For his gifts he has a new ps5 game, sweats and a shirt, some new books, and his favorite a snack hamper. For extra I got him a cold brew coffee kit but I need something else. It’s such a short list. He’s a new dad as well so I got him some fun stocking fillers like a marmite spreader and dad jokes etc. but I’m totally out of ideas. 

His coffee setup is very good as we have gotten him some very good gadgets over the years. His tech set up is pretty solid too and completely killed it with his birthday hahah so now I’m stuck. ",4,1765103259.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False
