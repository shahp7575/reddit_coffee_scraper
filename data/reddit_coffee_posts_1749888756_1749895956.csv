I’ve been sugar-free (except natural sugars like fruit and occasionally honey) and gluten-free for the past twenty days. I have also cut back on dairy, with some occasional cheese with a salad. I have also stopped drinking as much coffee, with just one cup a day, an hour after i wake up. I’ve also been alcohol free for the past three months. I started because my anxiety had become out of control and I wasn’t seeing enough progress. Also, I had inflammation and had gained some weight. 

I’m a 31-year old female. My start weight was 73kg for 1m75. 

Here’s what I’ve noticed: 

- My anxiety is less frequent now. I had panic attacks the first 5 days and now everything js more manageable.

- I have lost 4 kilos and I have a flatter stomach and my face is less puffy.

- I have more energy and a clearer mind. I’ve started reading again.

- I sleep so well. I used to get sugar cravings at midnight every night, which I’d sometimes give into.

- I’m less irritable and can « let things go » easily. I struggled with this before.

- I’ve just had my first period since the dietary changes. It only lasted 36 hours, as opposed to the usual 5 days it’s been my whole life. I didn’t get any pain or bloating. 

- My cravings have nearly disappeared and my taste buds appear to have changed. I like things that I once thought to be too bitter. 

I’m planning to stay off sugar for good. When I’m craving sugar, I have a banana with pure peanut butter and some salt or oats with honey and fruit, but the cravings are less frequent.

Like I just saw the cut content from pirates cove of how those dudes came in for target practice and gun down androids and like because of how human-like they are wouldn't that be like a major red flag in a person, like kids who kill small animals type shit? And the Jericho massacre, I mean the deviants are screaming and running and begging and even if you truly believe they're just glitched out robots it's so real, that shit would be traumatizing for the cops soldiers. Thats like the most traumatizing training simulation someone could think of, I really don't think it would be as easy as the game makes it look for the soldiers to just execute them all like some active shooter shit. 

When Conner is in the broadcast station and the roof terrace cop thanks him and says ""I never thought I'd say this to an android"" like come on man, wouldn't it just kinda be a reflex to say thank you after someone so human like brings you a cup of coffee or something like that? And all the Androids Marcus converts, not a SINGLE one is just kinda cool with their life or wants to just be a deviant that likes it's people.

# What Is a 20 Amp Circuit?

A 20 amp circuit is an electrical pathway that can safely deliver up to 20 amperes of current to connected devices. This limit is regulated by a **circuit breaker** labeled ""20"" in your breaker panel. If too much current is drawn (for example, plugging in multiple high-powered appliances), the breaker trips to prevent fire or wire overheating.

According to[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere), an **ampere** is a unit of electric current. In U.S. residential systems, most outlets operate on 120 volts. That means a 20 amp circuit can support up to **2400 watts** of electrical load (120 volts x 20 amps).

The circuit's ability to carry this load depends on the wire used. Most 20 amp circuits require **12-gauge copper wire**, which is thicker than the 14-gauge wire used for 15 amp circuits. This difference helps carry more current with lower resistance.

# Where Are 20 Amp Circuits Used in Homes?

Residential electrical systems are designed with different types of circuits depending on what devices will be connected. A 20 amp circuit is commonly installed in places where devices with moderate to high current needs are expected.

Kitchen Countertop Outlets

Kitchens often house multiple high-powered appliances. Toasters, coffee makers, microwaves, and blenders are frequently used at the same time. Electrical codes (such as the **National Electrical Code**, or **NEC**) require at least two 20 amp circuits for kitchen countertop outlets.

Bathroom GFCI Outlets

Hair dryers and curling irons may not seem demanding, but many draw over 1500 watts alone. Bathrooms often use **GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter)** outlets on a 20 amp circuit to accommodate this demand while adding protection in a wet environment.

Laundry Rooms

Washing machines require steady power and may be on a dedicated 20 amp circuit. While dryers typically use 240V circuits, the washer itself often runs off 120V/20A power.

Garages and Workshops

Power tools such as miter saws, drills, air compressors, and shop vacs often require a 20 amp circuit. These areas are usually wired with one or more dedicated circuits to handle varying equipment needs.

Home Offices and Dedicated Circuits

If you have multiple monitors, computers, printers, or servers, a dedicated 20 amp circuit may be needed. Devices with internal power supplies like UPS (uninterruptible power supply) backups also benefit from being on their own circuit.

HVAC Equipment and Room AC Units

Many window air conditioners draw between 1000 and 1800 watts. Plugging them into a 15 amp circuit can trip breakers. A 20 amp circuit gives more room for continuous operation.

# Identifying a 20 Amp Circuit

To check if a circuit is 20 amps:

* Open your breaker panel (carefully)
* Look for a breaker labeled with the number ""20""
* The associated wiring is usually **12 AWG copper**

You can reference wire gauge capacity from the[ Engineering Toolbox](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/ampacity-wires-d_1204.html), which outlines maximum ampacities for different wire sizes.

Never guess wire size if you’re unsure. Using a breaker that exceeds the wire’s rated capacity can lead to overheating and fires.

# 20 Amp vs 15 Amp Circuit

Both 15 amp and 20 amp circuits are common in U.S. homes, but they serve different functions:

Feature 15 Amp 20 Amp Max Wattage 1800 watts 2400 watts Wire Gauge 14 AWG 12 AWG Typical Use Lighting, general outlets Kitchen, garage, laundry, heavy appliances

You should **never replace a 15 amp breaker with a 20 amp** unless you're also replacing the wiring to 12-gauge. Otherwise, you risk overloading the wires.

# Electrical Code & Safety

The **National Electrical Code (NEC)** has clear guidelines for residential wiring. Some important ones for 20 amp circuits:

* Kitchens require two 20 amp small appliance circuits
* Bathrooms should have at least one 20 amp circuit for receptacles
* GFCI outlets are required in wet areas (bathrooms, kitchens, garages)

These standards reduce the risk of fires and electrical shock, especially in moisture-prone areas.

# Should You Upgrade to a 20 Amp Circuit?

Here are signs you may need one:

* Breaker frequently trips when using appliances
* Lights flicker when devices turn on
* You're remodeling and adding more power-hungry equipment
* Home office setup is overloaded

You may also want a dedicated 20 amp line when adding a **window AC unit**, high-powered **coffee machine**, or **air compressor**.

# Common Appliances That Use 20 Amp Circuits

* Microwave ovens
* Coffee makers (especially espresso or combo machines)
* Vacuum cleaners
* Table saws, miter saws
* Electric heaters
* Washing machines
* Shop vacs
* Refrigerators (large models)
* Dehumidifiers

These devices operate better and safer when connected to circuits that can handle their wattage.

# Upgrading Your Circuit Safely

To safely upgrade or install a new 20 amp circuit:

* Use **12 AWG copper wire** for new outlets or breakers
* Install a **20 amp-rated outlet** (some have a T-shaped slot)
* Only upgrade breaker size if wire gauge matches
* Turn off the main panel power before doing any work

If you’re not confident or legally permitted to perform the work, hire a licensed electrician.[ Here’s how to choose the right electrician](https://www.quora.com/profile/Timothy-Santos-Electric/How-to-Choose-the-Right-Electrician-for-Your-Home-or-Business).

# How Local Conditions Affect Circuit Design

Building codes may vary depending on your city or state. If you're in an older home or region with stricter inspection standards, it’s worth reviewing local code books or asking your electrical inspector.

In places with humid or cold climates, HVAC circuits, sump pumps, or heating appliances often require extra capacity. A 20 amp circuit offers more flexibility in these scenarios.

# Summary

So, **what is a 20 amp circuit used for**? In short: for safely powering devices that draw more electricity than standard lighting or outlet circuits can handle. These circuits are vital in kitchens, garages, bathrooms, and anywhere high-wattage appliances are used.

Understanding where and why to use them helps prevent electrical problems and supports modern living standards. If you're seeing signs of overload or planning upgrades, checking your home wiring and breaker types is a wise step.

And when in doubt? Call in a professional—especially for breaker panel work or full rewiring projects.

1lb51p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/buccos/comments/1lb51p2/konnor_griffin_is_him/,Konnor Griffin is Him,"

Jonathan Mayo from MLB.commas this to say back in March:

> The Pirates took Griffin No. 9 overall in the 2024 Draft out of the Mississippi high school ranks, and it’s hard not to get excited about his ceiling. He might have had the best set of raw tools in the entire class and the current No. 43 prospect has four tools that grade out as 60 (plus) or better on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He could end up being a very good shortstop or center fielder down the road, and it’s been a lot of fun to see him get a couple of hits, including a home run, in Grapefruit League games.

Thus far this season, Griffin has performed unlike really any recent Pirates draft pick. In Bradenton, in 54 games across 252 PA, he posted a .938 OPS, with a .341 AVG, .540 SLG and 29 SB. 

He recently was promoted to A+ Greensboro and is not surprisingly tearing it up. As noted by Jaiman White on BucsDugout:

> In his first game at High-A, Griffin would tally two doubles, an RBI, and a run scored as the Grasshoppers took game one 8-2. The next night, Griffin would again have two doubles, scored twice, plus another RBI and added a stolen base to his stat sheet helping to lift the Hoppers to another victory. In his most recent game Thursday, Griffin would gather another two hits, another run scored, another RBI, and another stolen base.

The real test will be when he gets to Altoona. The question is, when might that happen?

The Pirates have been notoriously slow paced when promoting high draft picks, typically maturing them by one level per year. Henry Davis was fast-tracked, and unfortunately his slow emergence at the MLB level may teach the wrong lessons to the Pirates management.

On the other hand, Griffin is still just 19. Guys promoted like Andrew Jones are rare, skipping through the minors with ease. Griffin may still hit a wall, so it’s early to be doing these sorts of projections. But who cares - it’s content for your pleasure on Reddit.

If he keeps raking at Greensboro, could he make it to AA by the end of the year? If he keeps it going into next year, could we see him by the end of 2026? A cup of coffee before premiering after the Super 2 deadline in 2027? His original ETA was 2028, but that seems too conservative given his performance to date.

Also, he plays SS and CF. Sounds vaguely familiar. At 6’4, he is a guy scouts were thinking could stick at SS.

1lb4j6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1lb4j6v/getting_over_fear_of_abandonment/,Getting over fear of abandonment,"Hi guys,

it's been a while since I've posted here even though my BPD symptoms have been acting up and I could have used support, but I figured I'd try to handle it myself this time and I think I did.

My BPD symptoms were actually very minimal until 2 years ago (after a period of a full year when they were horrible) and they started again once I entered a relationship. The worst part of it has been fear of abandonment but I think I figured out why I have it and how to handle it so I thought I'd share it here, maybe it helps someone.

**The cause**:

I strongly believe that my fear of abandonment comes from my lack of self confidence. I always feel like I am not good enough in some way, especially for my boyfriend since we share a really big age gap and I sometimes feel like I am not ""mature enough"" for him. However, the reality is, if I wasn't, he wouldn't be with me, especially since he isn't a big fan of our age gap (it wasn't planned, neither of us sought it out, it just happened since we are truly compatible as people).

**Triggers**:

Triggers for me are pretty much any woman that is next to him at any given moment. My mind keeps telling me that he will see someone more attractive than me and just dump me for that someone else. He has not given me any reason to think this, it's literally just all in my head. I also go out of my way to stalk the women in his life and I am trying really hard to not do it (I had a few fake accounts where I added these women but I deleted those accounts). I would stare at theid photos for hours and compare myself to them, so of course I'd feel terrible, it's really easy to convince yourself that you are ""worth less"" when you are looking for problems.

**Solutions**:

1. **No more stalking** - It only does harm. All the time I spent stalking could have been used for something actually productive.

2. **Practising self love** - When I was single, I would take myself on ""a date"" to the city each week, I would grab a coffee, go for a walk while listening to music, buy myself something, however, since getting together with my boyfriend, I've stopped doing that. I will start again. I love spending time alone. Granted, I have cats at home now and love being with them but I can find the time to go somewhere alone once a week for an hour or two.

3. **Physical activity** - This is something I have been doing for 5 years, specifically weight lifting in my case, but it can be anything. I also used to take daily walks but had to stop due to knee pain (training, cardio at home and walking were too much, had to cut something out). I put physical activity on the list even though it's something I have actively been practising for years but I figured I'd add it because it could get someone else to consider it. It is actually the only thing that has been keeping me sane in midst of it all.

I know that everything I wrote isn't something groundbreaking or special, but it genuinely helps me so I feel it was worth writing down and sharing.

1lb4fpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1lb4fpr/34m_seeking_the_fervent_curious_and_authentic/,"[34/M] - Seeking the fervent, curious, and authentic","Hello!

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation.

I'm looking to buy my mother an espresso set up for her birthday (the whole family drinks coffee so it will definitely be well used haha). Her current set up is a moka pot and she always has milk with her coffee.

From what I've seen on the breville bambino plus and baratza encore espresso are a pretty common first pairing which I feel pretty happy with since she mainly drinks milk drinks, but the autofrothing is a nice touch if she doesn't want to get super involved in learning how to froth milk (or do it insanely early in the morning).

My main question is what are the other accessories that make a good minimum set up? My current thoughts are a small set of scales and tamping mat to protect to kitchen counter.

She's into coffee but don't think she would want to get into the home barista level of coffee prep, and I also don't want to buy her something she won't end up using! Also happy with thoughts about the machines mentioned, or where to find good deals on them

Thank you very much :)

Extra info: in UK, it would probably make 2-3 drinks a day regularly, occasionally more when guests are over. We all have milk based drinks, not straight espresso.

Representative Sura delivered a beautiful speech condemning the remaining Thatch's in Spires 1 and 2 for their slanderous accusations against the government earlier this month. The collaboraters tried to stage yet another rally in Spire 2 this afternoon but things turned violent when several Thatch's pulled guns and opened fire on officers. Heavy floor to floor fighting still persists as local riot forces make their way up the Spire, though we are told that they are making good time.

Spire 3 is expected to surrender sometime early tomorrow as the remaining Thatch's have been driven to the lowest levels. Authorities say that if necessary said levels can be flooded, killing the Thatch's, and avoiding the loss of further Europan life.

Representative Perry put forth yet another bill to nationalize the Spires earlier today. Though similar to the previous 9 bills this one is expected to pass due to voter fatigue and mounting pressure to march in step with District 2. However Educator Party leader Hank Miller has not backed down from is assertion that following District 2 is not in the best interests of Europa. He continues to cite the rampant unrest and persecution of Thatch's as 'mirroring the UNCA in all the worst ways.'

As of today  Miller has recieved 14,000 death threats in the mail alone, though his popularity in the polls is slowly increasing. It may yet be that he proves to be the true voice of Europa as it is rather clear that ""ascendant"" District 2 is starting to mirror the UNCA ' in all the worst ways.'

Dear Representative Sura,

I am unable to break the Educator resistance long enough to get anything accomplished. I can't even sqeeze them long enough push through the Spire Act. To make things worse Miller has started to push for granting the Thatch's protected status. The Party has even been implicated a recent series attempts on ranking Educators. The Party is losing the support of the populace a little more each day. I need some form of leverage or The Party is in real danger of being crushed.

The Sol Union Council officially met to discuss the issue of the Earth first policies still in effect from the UN Council and UN Colonization Authority respectively. The first item scheduled for discussion was the fact that the Solar Union's administrative capital is still officially in New York City. The colonies have expressed much resentment as of late with Representative Foster of the 8th Martian District stating:

""We find it offensive that after decades of Earth-based oppression under the UN, that the seat of the governmnet is situated on Earth. Many in the UN have stated that we are hung up on the fact that Earth is so prosperous and that we just want to knock it down a peg.  I can guarantee that, that is not the reason it rubs us wrong, but rather it is the fact that the capital sets within the borders of one of the leading states of the UN, which has brutally oppressed us for so long.

It's not like the UN was disolved when the SU came it being, it very much still rules over Earth and it currently meets in the same building as the SU. There is a very UN feel to the SU at the moment and the same old UN agendas are clearly being pushed. Add to that the fact that most of the UN delegates use the proximity as an excuse to serve on both the UN Council and SU Council, and it quickly becomes easy to see why we're so upset.

If the SU is to be the solution it was meant to be, we need to do it right. We shouldn't give any one group the advantage over the others. We need to build the Capital on neutral ground.""

They are the majority and its only a matter of time before they get their act together. If we don't do something, we'll be overwhelmed by our foes in our current state.

We all know that when we lose our voice there will no longer be any justice for us.

Dear Mr. Miller,

It pleases me to see you rise to the head of your party. Your voice of reason serves to unify your people in this time of great instability. Your reason tempers the inflamatory retorhic of ones such as Suran and Perry. For this reason I reach out to you today. I am afraid for the future of this new Union if such extreme voices strangle the people's greater reason.

Alone the Educator's will lose momentum and the Thatch's will be smothered, it is only a matter of time. Both our parties support the reformations of my father and denounce the corruption of the greater UNCA. I would like to propose that we combine our parties and save the good in this Union, before those blinded by hate tear it out in anger.

I still have access to my father's connections, and I know for a fact that in this coming week's cession Representative Suran plans on proposing moving the capital to the Asteriod belt. He is counting on the Mars First Party to help carry the motion. Not only will it be a very expensive undertaking but, without a base solar body, its maintainance will have to be done by a constantly revolving staff. They are planning on using its proximity to their power centers to place a native staff with similar extremist views onboard. We both know from history that if the support structure wants something enough, it will get it.

We have a plan to bring the Union to a more stable state, but we can only succeed with the help of people like you. We plan on having Representative Albert Baker propose moving the Capital to the neutral location of the Lunar Colony. It will appease the Earth and the Old Colonies. The Lunar Colony also has enough infrastructure to faciliate growth and is new and small enough to not have any developed singular identity.

Please stand with us.

Thomas Thatch

After months of heavy debate and gridlock the Sol Union Council is finally voting today on the motion of where to relocate the Sol Union Capital.

In other news riots and killings consumed the former Europan Capital again today as another Thatch Party rally was surpressed by riot police at Europan Spire 1. Europan District 2 Administrator Simon Marlon gave this comment: ""The affairs of Europa are Europa's. That includes the dispersal and detainment of extremist groups.""

Tina Ross \[Europan Thatch Party Coordinator\] gave this statement: ""They are suppressing us because we tell the truth. Things were by no means perfect under the UNCA, they were awful. At first even Overseer Thatch and Governess Matthias seemed to be exploiting us but, at least they did something. We could tell, especially as time went on, that they weren't just pocketing profits and leaving us to die. They were actually trying to give something back to us that everyone else had taken.""

When asked what her administration was doing about this situation SU President Violeta Baribeau responded: ""We are looking into the situation but see no need to act at this time.""

In 3018 the governments of Earth designated the moon as the official seat of power for the Sol Union.

Today's Unification Day celebrations were marred by the murders of former UNCA Colonial Security Directors (Europa) Hank Philips, (Uranus) Rubi Ayon, Amaury Begnaud, Noella Courcy, Tanguy Damboise, Esme Guinard, and (Almathea) Bethany Meyers. Philips was found hanging in a tree {Buffalo, New York} with the word Survivor carved behind him. Ayon, Begnaud, Courcy and Guinard were found in Ayon's residence (Nimes, France) at the dinning room table. Authorities believe the cause of death to be Carbon monoxide poisoning. The word Survivor was found written on one of the cards on the table. Damboise' body was found shot and stabbed in the loire river (France). Meyers was found strangled in Agulhas Lighthouse (Agulhas Park, South Africa). Survivor was painted above her in graffitti. Authorities believe this to be the work of a group rather than a single person. Authorities say that the so called Unity Killers have arleady made threats against at least four other undisclosed, former UNCA members.

Representative Jin Sura gave a speech today in light of yesterday's killings.

""Hank Philips, Rubi Ayon, Amaury Begnaud, Noella Courcy, Tanguy Damboise, Esme Guinard, and Bethany Meyers. These men and women served the UNCA with great distinction. They made a career in being extremely generous to the colonies. You could say without a doubt that they were experts at mass murder. People so skilled only ever occur once in a generation.

Now the elements of the old order baw and bock when their victims return the favor. Decent human beings however recognize that justice denied is chaos. These Unity Killers are living up to their names by removing the obstacles to a lasting peace. Should I ever meet one of them I will shake their hand and embrace them as a fellow Patriot. Godspeed.""

Sura's speech was met with mass demonstrations of supporters on Ganymede, Amalthea, Europa and Uranus. A repeated chant of 'Unity' rose up from the crowds. There are thousands of reports of Thatch Party supporters being dragged out of their houses and beaten.

When asked what her administration was doing about this situation SU President Violeta Baribeau responded: ""These matters are internal in nature. The planetary and district governments will handle this matter- That is what they are here for. Every planet must determine what is best for its people.""

The Sol Council has tried to issue Emergency Order 1 {Authorization of Martial Law} in the regions but an executive veto by Baribeau killed it on the floor.

In just a moment we will be tuning into a speech being given by Thomas Thatch, son of former UNCA Overseer Thatch.

""I am Thomas Nathaniel Thatch. Some of you know me, all of you know my father Michael Robert Thatch. I was born on Earth in my father's hometown of Flint, Michigan. I was raised both there and in the Space Spirals. I personally served as Overseeing Medical Director on Europa, Ganymede, Almathea and Mars following the death of Director Powel. I met my beloved Lucilla in Dion, Mars. We were wed in the small town of Glenda, Aleksota on Venus. We settled in the small town of Lakestone outside of Dion. There we had our beautiful daughter Susanne. I tell you these things so you know who it is that is speaking to you.

I am a Solarian born and raised. I am an American born and raised. I am a Thatch born and raised. I am a human born and raised. I look out across all of Sol system and do you know what I see?"" {Pauses briefly} ""***I SEE HUMANS! I SEE PEOPLE LIKE ME!***

Despite what some hate filled people might try to say. We are all people. We are all Solarians. We all get up at the start of our day. We all lay down at the end of our day. We all fill the space in between with things we love and things we don't.

Do not let the hate of men and women like Sura blind you to these truths. The sun does not shine only on a particular planet or people. At the end of the day we are all Solarians. To Sura and those who support him I have this message: ***WE ARE SOLARIANS TOO.*** We all deserve to have an oportunity to live our lives in the peace, happiness, and dignity belonging to Humans.""

Following Thomas Thatch's address yesterday the riots on Earth have ceased. Law enforcement and first responders have begun the process of putting things back together. Even the Europan Flag, though flown at half mast, has found its way back amongst the flags atop the joint SU-UN building.

The riots on Uranus concluded peacefully when the last of the rioters dispersed yesterday late in the afternoon.

The riots on Europa, Amalthea, and Ganymede ended late last night when large crowds gathered to meet the chants of ""Unity"" with the deafening roar of **""WE ARE SOLARIANS TOO.""** Some fighting broke out between the groups in Europa District 1 which ended with Adminstrator Nancy Sinclair using police forces to supress the Unity riot.

Suran gave a statement on the matter. However this station has decided to give an abridged version. He feels the surpression of the rioters was an unwaranted hate crime. While this station will continue to remain unbiased it is this reporter's personal opinion that Suran is a brazen hypocrite.

Today is a momentous point in Sol history as the Sol Union Council will be taking up its post for the first time in new Lunar Capital. After 2 years of mass renovation it is hard to recognize this once backwater settlement.

As the only solar space territory outside the asteriod belt with population below 5 million the Lunar colony was the only applicable settlement without a direct voice in the SU. Being centrally located, close to the home world, and without any unique political voice the moon was deemed the perfect administrative capital. This once failed project ultimately proved to be the only acceptable compromise candidate for the new capital.

""You were Matthias personal data clerk. We want the original files.""

""I was just an office secretary, I got coffee and set day appointments nothing else.""

""We on Europa know that the files that were submitted and read in the trial were heavily altered. We also know that every  report between Matthias and the UNCA offices  passed through one of 6 terminals.  1-5 were for each moon she governed; 6 was for outside communications.  Every last operator has been interviewed and their testimony confirmed. You and I however know that none of those interviewed were the real original operators.""

""We have a witness in the Red Cross who can identify  the voice of operator 4. The alleged 4 wasn't even the right gender let alone voice. Your testimony outted you.""

""I'm not operator 4.""

""No, you're operator 6. You see, when we realized that the witnesses were fakes we started combing for iregularities in employee records. Low a behold we found an employee that records indicated was a secretary but, who had been depositing a rather extensive pay check in a hidden series of accounts for the last 15 years. A pay check that  perfectly matched the offical records of operator 6.""

It's almost like someone on the inside cut a deal to send them with the red cross supplies. I mean we don't ever check those transports, time sensitive materials and what not.

I really should be thanking them for exposing that oversight and vetting my staff. It's a real shame though that they found even one snake in the grass.""

Today with the conclusion to the Human Rights Cases riots broke out on Ganymede and Europa. While former Governor Tobias Vista was sentenced to execution for his crimes against Humanity, controversally former Overseer Michael Thatch and Governess Abigail Matthias have been found not guilty on all charges.

While Matthias refused to comment on the situation Thatch did provide a statement: ""We are all shocked at the conduct of Vista... No Tobias, as I once deemed him a close associate. I even personally asked the UN to confirm him as I belived that he would be a good fit... no a decent human being. For my misjudgement I am truly sorry.

However, while Vista did do unspeakable acts and I for my part failed to recognize that my past trust was blinding me to it, that is no excuse to try to bring down Abigail. She did nothing but what a Governess ought to do. She looked out for the interests of the people she had been entrusted with to the best of her ability. The very system we found ourselves serving simply prevented us from being able to do all that we tried to do for the colonies, and now they want to kill her for what doing what little she could do for them.

It is an act of utmost cruelty when an opressed people kill the very ones that protected them when no else would. I only hope they realize that before they become the very thing they claim to hate.""

Michael Thatch:	""Right now, in this moment of critical expansion, everyone from the old government is seen as too corrupt to use and the new officials are all inexperienced. We've been declared sqeeky clean, we have connections to the old government, and we have experience with the colonies. The Sol Union needs experience and Earth needs a trump card over the colonies.""

Representatives Jin Sura and Rene Perry in particular have called for a unified colonial front against the appointment of Matthias. As it stands however the proposed ""Spacer"" movement is handicapped by the shadow of Sura's last ""Unity"" movement.

I want to introduce this concept ""open to talk"", the core idea is to have a little sign you can take with you to your table, drop it on that says 'join me' lowering that barrier. 

  
The other idea is to make an app, so you can see if there are any people willing to socialize when you're not there + the ability to link it to a phone number and block creeps possibly if they have say 3 strikes where they made the other person uncomfortable.

I’m new to Reddit and the speciality coffee brewing scene. While I’ve always loved speciality coffee, I’ve never actually attempted to brew it myself; I’ve typically enjoyed it at cafes. However, I’ve finally decided to learn how to brew my coffee, especially because it's my dream to create a beautiful coffee corner at home and eventually open a small, cute coffee shop. I'm documenting my journey on Instagram as well.

I’ve started with a 17-year-old drip machine that was gifted to my dad, but he never used it. I have watched James Hoffmann’s videos and understand that this isn’t the best device for brewing coffee, but I didn’t want to invest too much right away. I did invest in a Chestnut C2 grinder and purchased some sampler packs of coffee beans. Unfortunately, my first attempt didn’t turn out great; the coffee was a bit bitter, and the coffee bed was uneven.

I would love to hear your tips on how I can improve my brewing technique. I’m excited to be part of this community!

I know. Yes it was crazy overwhelming I thought my eyes were gonna fall out from so much eye contact. Anyway. I got  two matches. One seems kinda cute and normal vibes and has suggested coffee. One slightly less cute but I got interesting introverted vibes. but they've suggested party crazy indoor golf as the date. Idk if you know it but  just imagine vibrant dancing colours, loud rave party music and moving crazy machinery, plus a sport that id probably enjoy but I'd want to be quiet and focus and do it properly. 


but then!! superimplant that I'm ""meant"" to be ""making a good impression"" so I should be fun and smiley and enjoy this golf, not really try to win (not ladylike?) and not die from how awful and overwhelming it sounds as an environment.

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and writing inspirations! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Alas, I would beside myself to write a half-way coherent list of what I actually like to see. Hopefully, my advert thus far and the list of fiction I like to draw inspiration from further on will give you a pretty good idea! On the other hand, a lot of the dislikes are things that are pretty common in the roleplaying scene, on top of myself being much more flexible with my likes than I ever am with my dislikes.

Anyway, here's a (somewhat) short list of things I prefer *not* to see in my collaborative writing stories:

Fandoms, pre-industrial settings, superhero genre, fluff/grimdark extremes, sanitized immoral groups, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers ^((main pair)), slice-of-life, werewolves/vampires, standard fantasy races, isekai, stories taking place in a single location, romance as the main plot, toxic masculinity, love at the first sight, comedy as the a main genre, the Masquerade ^((magic being a secret)), real-world settings ^((e.g., Marvel, HP)), protector/protected ^((main pair)), arranged marriage, school settings, police/military settings, evil (or *very* morally gray) protagonists,

There's actually very, *very* few storytelling tropes I refuse to use no matter what, so I'm more than happy to elaborate on any one of these! Still, I *typically* either dislike the tropes listed above, or am very particular about how to use them when I do. Or, I may simply not be currently in the mood for some of these.

While I do **not** write in fandoms anymore, as outlined above, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Here's a short list in a (somewhat) descending order:

Final Fantasy series ^((in particular VI, VII, X and XV)), Fullmetal Alchemist ^((this is a big one!)). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania ^((the animated series, not the games)), Avatar: The Last Airbender ^((as well as Legend of Korra!)), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series ^((as well as the Wax and Wayne series!)), and Monster ^((the odd one on the list!)),

It is my extremely limited experience, but it hasn't really worked any well for me with people unfamiliar with any of these! So, if that's the case with you, do approach at your own peril!

Of course, these are by no means the full extent of fiction I enjoy in general! That said, I have noticed that these are simply the pieces I am by far the most likely to reach out to for inspiration at this moment.

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

Normally, they just give each other the stink-eye, but now they're full-on gladiators, and my house is their arena. Yesterday, I watched Duchess pull off this ninja move, leaping from the couch to steal the bone right out of Barky's mouth, then zooming up the cat tree like she's queen of the castle. Barky loses it, barking like a lunatic, knocking over my coffee table while trying to chase her down. Toys are flying everywhere, the neighbor's dog starts yapping like it's part of the drama, and I'm standing there in my slippers, shouting, ""SERIOUSLY, IT'S A $2 TOY, CALM DOWN!""

I’m currently based near Yeonhui-dong and Yeonnam-dong. i really love the vibe in this area and there are so many cafes I’d love to check out.

I’m looking to connect with other women (20s–50s) who’d enjoy chatting over coffee.

Some of the things I like: travel, dogs, living abroad, yoga & pilates, piano, concerts, nature, plants & flowers, learning languages, good people, complaining about bad air quality in seoul…and recently, I’ve been obsessed with gukbap! 국밥😆

If you’re up for a chill cafe meet-up sometime, feel free to DM me. Maybe I can organize a small group meet up with 3-4 people. Let’s find our favorite coffee together☕️

4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and writing inspirations! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Alas, I would beside myself to write a half-way coherent list of what I actually like to see. Hopefully, my advert thus far and the list of fiction I like to draw inspiration from further on will give you a pretty good idea! On the other hand, a lot of the dislikes are things that are pretty common in the roleplaying scene, on top of myself being much more flexible with my likes than I ever am with my dislikes.

Anyway, here's a (somewhat) short list of things I prefer *not* to see in my collaborative writing stories:

Fandoms, pre-industrial settings, superhero genre, fluff/grimdark extremes, sanitized immoral groups, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers ^((main pair)), slice-of-life, werewolves/vampires, standard fantasy races, isekai, stories taking place in a single location, romance as the main plot, toxic masculinity, love at the first sight, comedy as the a main genre, the Masquerade ^((magic being a secret)), real-world settings ^((e.g., Marvel, HP)), protector/protected ^((main pair)), arranged marriage, school settings, police/military settings, evil (or *very* morally gray) protagonists,

There's actually very, *very* few storytelling tropes I refuse to use no matter what, so I'm more than happy to elaborate on any one of these! Still, I *typically* either dislike the tropes listed above, or am very particular about how to use them when I do. Or, I may simply not be currently in the mood for some of these.

While I do **not** write in fandoms anymore, as outlined above, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Here's a short list in a (somewhat) descending order:

Final Fantasy series ^((in particular VI, VII, X and XV)), Fullmetal Alchemist ^((this is a big one!)). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania ^((the animated series, not the games)), Avatar: The Last Airbender ^((as well as Legend of Korra!)), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series ^((as well as the Wax and Wayne series!)), and Monster ^((the odd one on the list!)),

It is my extremely limited experience, but it hasn't really worked any well for me with people unfamiliar with any of these! So, if that's the case with you, do approach at your own peril!

Of course, these are by no means the full extent of fiction I enjoy in general! That said, I have noticed that these are simply the pieces I am by far the most likely to reach out to for inspiration at this moment.

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

1lb44hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1lb44hf/strange_instagram_account/,Strange instagram account,"Don’t know exactly where to put this, but this sub occasionally gets submissions of this nature, so I’ll put it here.

I was scrolling instagram and found a random post from [this account](https://www.instagram.com/christophersteamboat?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==).

The account calls itself Christopher Steamboat and it is listed as a software company. It has 331 posts and was created in November 2024, which was somewhere between 224-193 days ago, which means this person posts at least daily. I guess it might not be extremely weird, but usually you’d do that on your story rather than on your posts. But that’s not really my concern.

First, most of the accounts they follow are celebrities, which isn’t extremely strange. But many of the accounts that follow them are random Indian accounts with no connection to the post material or the area he seems to be from (which is near San Bernardino, California based on what I was able to find out.) 

The post I was recommended reads: “Ricky n Raymond need to go to GHEY camp or underage S/O institution”

I don’t exactly know what this means, looking up “GHEY camp” and “underage S/O institution” didn’t pull up anything useful. I think maybe “GHEY camp” = gay camp or something relating to conversion therapy? This is just assumptions though. (Note: S/O probably means sex offender. Further context below.)

Anyway, looking through the account made things even weirder. Again, this guy (assuming) posts frequently and has many posts. None of them are normal. Here are some I found particularly odd:

“#Groper #SexRing #SemiVirgin ||
I live in protect custody current, in LA County jail protect custody, in S/O prison I roll with gay boy gangsters, Chaffey College I took sexual assault classes to get in those classes you have to be a S/O”

“Land lost TOO ME WHAT FIGHT OUTNUMBER 97% MEXICAN I fight blacks on sight I rather grope Nortena & border brother Women #DARKSEIDWAR”

“(Baby Africa) turn the world black, (Slave Feet) East Los Angeles (Slavenue), (Pop belly) Long Beach, (Animal Testing) Mira Loma, (Ape Ball) Alhambra 18st, (Monkey's) Dragonball Super Planet of the apes, Undefeated Boyz smell (chocolate 🍫) or (purple puzzy), (Sex Ring) Many Citys, Lost Gabriel over 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 #Words
(Arabic Eyebrows), (Disease Coronavirus COVID 19) Compton Varrio 132 (Asian h8), (Parasites) (Indigenous Day) Trended off (Foreign Coffee day) (Black Eye 👁️ 0%) Burnt (Holy) (Unholy) (Satanic) bibles (RAEL ILLUMINATI BIBLE???) (DREAM RED RUM) (FREE THE DRUGS ANIMALS ON THE STUFF TOO)”

“CALL OF DUTY NAZI N TATTOO
ILLUMINATI TRIANGLE VEIN
TATTOO
MS-13 NAIL TO THE CROSS”

Again, I randomly got recommended this account while scrolling. The only connection it may have to me is that me and the person who runs it are from broadly the same region in California. That’s the only reason I can think of for me being recommended this. Their posts have very little views (many under 100). 

I’d say my initial assumption is mental illness or
drugs, but it’s very late right now so I’ve not taken a very deep dive. I’m sure there’s a lot I’ve missed and I don’t want to make huge assumptions yet. If anyone finds anything else that would be great.",2,1749891086.0,RBI,1,0.75,False

Very much a coffee noob here. I've recently decided to graduate from instant coffee and decided to get a moka pot. Unfortunately the stove at my current place has induction cooktops so I began looking at induction mokas. But I have a few questions around the regular ones:

* Can I use a regular Aluminium moka pot with my induction stove ? I'm assuming the pulse width modulation thing will make it hard to get good coffee but would be delighted to hear stories to the contrary
* If I can't/shouldn't use it directly with an induction stove (and if I don't want to invest in a steel plate), can I just place the moka pot in a small pot with water (enough to submerge the water carrying bit in the moka) and then put the whole thing on the stove ? My thinking is - the induction stove will boil the water in the outer pot which should then ideally heat up the water in the moka. It would be well regulated heat too since water in the outer pot will boil and stay at around boiling temp. I don't know if this would work, or make good coffee",3,1749890598.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

**Playoff Chase**

The First Half finishes for Double-A and Single-A leagues will end on Thursday, June 19th (5 games away), and the Giants have two teams vying for 1st-half titles and therefore playoff berths.  In the California League, the Giants have the league-best record of 38-23, and hold a 2.0 game lead over 2nd place Modesto for the North division, for a Magic Number of 4.  After finishing this week’s two games with Stockton, San Jose will travel to Modesto (for the last time ever, barring playoffs), and will have three games there to end the first half.  Rancho Cucamonga has clinched the South Division’s 1st-half title.

Eugene’s loss saw them slip to third in a competitive NWL season, with four teams all within 2.0 games.  Vancouver leads at 33-28 (thanks to a 8-game winning streak), Everett is in second at 32-29 (1.0 games back), and Eugene and Hillsboro are tied for third with a 31-30 (2.0 games back).  Eugene has two games left against Hillsboro, and then three games against Vancouver remaining in the first half.

Richmond, meanwhile, is in a Rockies-esque last place at 18-43, 22.0 games back in the Southwest Division of the Eastern League, so it’s safe to say they won’t be the first half division title (which will go to Erie or Akron for the Southwest, and Binghamton having won the Northeast Division).  

Triple-A’s first half ends on June 22nd, when Sacramento finishes their 3-week “road” trip.  The River Cats are in 2nd place in the West Division, with a 33-34 record, but at 9.5 games back, they were eliminated from contention with Las Vegas’ win on Friday.",3,1749890433.0,SFGiants,0,1.0,False
1lb3y76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1lb3y76/barista_guy/,Barista Guy,"I 27 M, recently for the past months meron akong malaking problema in which nakaapekto sa akin emotionally. Kapag may ganitong instances I usually go to coffee shop since Mandaluyong area yung work ko may nahanap ako. First time ko pumunta ang ganda ng ambiance and very relaxing yung set-up kaya nagustuhan ko. 

Just to be honest crush ko yung may ari way back pa hahaha medyo sikat siya kasing content creator, so eto na nga since lagi akong pumupunta may isang barista ang kumakausap sakin nung una wala siya kasi customer service need maging friendly or approachable. Then tumagal ang ilang araw may napapansin ako na kakaiba lagi na niya akong inaasar in a good way na nagiging cute siya sa paningin ko nagkakaroon ako ng comfort kapag kausap siya until recently nagkakaroon ako ng conclusion na crush niya ako? Ito yung mga points ko
1.  Napapansin ko usually na everytime na pumupunta ako nakikita ko yung ngiti niya na parang ang saya saya( delulu moments ata to)
2. May isang case na siya ang nasa kahera tapos hindi kasi ako coffee person so nagask ako ano difference ng ibat ibang ( kunware hindi ko alam) hanggang sa inexplain niya and ang sabi niya sir don’t worry gagawin ko yung kape niyong special! (Like bakit special huh?! I don’t get it pero kinilig ako hahahaha tapos kinakamusta ako kung masarap ba daw)
3. Nagorder ulit ako food then siya nagserve napansin ko nangingig siya habang inaabot yung pagkain at drink ko (delulu ba ito or pasmado lang siya)
4. Tapos pumunta kami ng friends ko sa coffee shop nila tapos bet ko umorder ng coffee then naalala ko yung sinabi niya sakin before na may itatry daw siyang coffee sakin, siya daw gagawa so hinanap ko sa menu yung sinasabi wala siya kaloka so chinat ko siya sa ig kasi wala pa siya. Sabi niya hindi daw talaga alam nung ina yun kasi siya lang nakakaalam nun- tinanong ko bakit hindi nila and yun nilinaw niya na siya lang nakakaalam biniro ko pa nga lagi mo bang sinasuggest yan sa iba? Sabi niya hindi sabi ko special ko naman pala hahaa tawa siya.
5. May mga cases nakikita ko siyang nakatitig sakin, for validation purposes napansin din ng friends ko.

Then recently triny ko siya kausapin about dun kasi medyo naappreciate ko yung kindness niya towards me sabi k onakatulong siya sakin pero umamin na din ako na interested ako to know him kaya kinausap ko siya. Tapos awit na yan sabi niya sakin sorry daw kasi hidni niya intention na maconfused ako gusto niya lang makipagfriends. 

Valid ba yung naramdaman ko or OA lang ako??

It started off with this infection game-esque thing happening on the site of a medieval theme park where some ""Hunters"" (according to dream thoughts) tagged regular people to make them Hunters too and apparently this was going on for days, because some mysterious force was stopping anyone from entering or leaving. There was a theme park hotel and it was kind of like safe middle ground, and I have no idea why no one just tried camping in there.

On the actual day when the dream was set some idiot had released a *second* infection that made Hunters look like regular players and vice versa, so everyone was running to the hotel to escape (me included), but when we got there it was being demolished, meaning no safe area. And I just sat on the site  accepting death when out of the blue an old security guard comes in and gives out the lore of the death game where the theme park hotel was once haunted and the haunted-ness was escaping into the park itself.

Apparently it soon got held back making the park safe for some time, which is when I get told that to permanently save the people I have to do this thing called a ""Coffee Trial"", where you drink a custom-made cup of coffee at one of the park cafes (that wasn't medieval themed unlike everything else) while a clone of yourself is in the vicinity and it was supposed to function as a mental trial.

So I get there, the clone is sitting around eating ramen and the barista for the trial says that my cup of ""coffee"" was supposed to test all of the lying I had been doing. And because of this ""lying that I had been doing"", the cup I got was filled with regular tap water.

I drink it, and then the clone of me just stands at the other end of the cafe, menacingly pouring a jug into some soil as if it was the all important Coffee MacGuffin. It wasn't. It was more tap water, and the clone genuinely believed it was coffee and refused to admit it wasn't until I drank it and confirmed that it was indeed, tap water.

I ended up passing and got a second cup of actually good coffee that tasted really good, and I woke up, and now I miss it.",1,1749890212.0,OneTimeIDreamt,0,1.0,False

So let me start by saying this. For Mother’s Day she gets every year. Breakfast coffee ect in bed. Stays in bed till 10-11. Spa day for herself and out for lunch after with the kids. Gifts from the kids on stuff they can do together and a special one from me to say thank you. Evening out for dinner. Everything paid for off my back. Basically what every women would want on a special day. 

So let’s move on to what I wanted I told her this as i was asked. 

She asked if I wanted time away from the kids. I said no? Like what father wants to be away from his kids on the day where you reflect on you being a father. That’s odd to me. 

I wanted to stay in bed breakfast in bed. She told me I’m asking for too much and I’m dreaming.

She asked if I really needed a gift? I was like I guess not but would be nice for her to go with the kids and get something modest and small. She asked me this last night. Showing me she hadn’t put in any effort. I started to look and get pissed off at this point. Knowing every year I give for her. 

She then asked about food. Said she sorted it. Turns out when she excitedly told me, that we’re going to a high end expensive restaurant near us that she had been eyeing up. I was thankful but I knew off of her salary she wouldn’t have been able to afford it. So I asked are you sure? How are you going to be able to afford it? She then told me don’t worry because I will be paying for it anyways. Now we’re talking high end high end. 

 Now leading onto what I know I’m going to get (cos I have been told bluntly) nothing that I would have done and have done for her. Just another day for me paying for everything and running around after everyone while she probably gets to stay in bed again.

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

At this point, I’ve narrowed it down to one of three scenarios:

1. I was used to have a child.
2. She has an undiagnosed personality disorder.
3. Her abusive mother manipulated her into leaving and divorcing me.

For context (see my past posts), my wife abruptly left with our daughter last year — no warning, no fight, no conversation. Just an email from a lawyer saying she was filing for divorce, seeking full custody, and claiming she didn’t feel safe. That was the first I heard of it.

The allegations in her RFO were absurd. Apparently, I was a danger because I walk too much, drink coffee inconsistently, and started wearing a new shoe size. I initially thought this might be postpartum-related and did everything I could to get her help, but her parents cut me out, refused any discussion, and even hid her whereabouts. To this day, I still don’t know what was said behind closed doors — but I strongly suspect her mother wrote the divorce papers.

After a long legal battle — supervised visits, co-parent counseling, hearings — I now have 50/50 custody of our 15-month-old daughter. None of her claims held up. She’s fired her lawyers, been sanctioned by the court, racked up over $200K in legal fees, and still behaves like nothing’s wrong.

We don’t speak. Any attempt to ask questions is met with threats or stonewalling. It feels like even acknowledging reality sends her into legal attack mode. If she cheated? Honestly, I wouldn’t care. We were married for only 1.5 years, and since then I’ve lost my job, spent over $100K in legal fees, and been robbed of irreplaceable time with my daughter — all without a single honest conversation.

What stuns me most is the complete refusal to take any off-ramp. There were so many chances to handle this with decency — she ignored every one. Her parents, sadly, seem worse. They’ll now spend the rest of their lives facing the reality that they helped destroy their granddaughter’s family.

I have no idea how I’ll explain this to my daughter one day. I doubt her mother has thought about that. Maybe she’ll lie. But the truth has a way of surfacing over time. I won’t badmouth her mother — but I also won’t lie.",2,1749889547.0,Divorce_Men,0,1.0,False

There was this guy playing the flute but with, like, a completely unexpected jazz tempo. People were passing by, giving each other curious looks, and that’s when I noticed this guy next to me, also intrigued. 

We exchanged a quick eye roll and smirk as the flutist hit this particularly high note. ""Wonder if he's taking requests,"" he joked, nudging me lightly. ""Think he knows Beyoncé?"" 

I laughed and replied, ""Only if she’s done a secret cover of 'Flight of the Bumblebee'.""

That got a real chuckle out of him. We stood there for a few more moments, listening to this unique blend of music and laughing whenever he’d glance over with another playful comment. It was just one of those charming little exchanges that brightened my day. Who knew flute music could be such a conversation starter? 😊",5,1749889523.0,softflirts,0,0.86,False

Hi! I’m looking for someone to hang out with—someone who doesn’t take themselves too seriously but still knows how to be kind, empathetic, and respectful of people’s limits. I’ve been trying to make more meaningful friendships in this city, but honestly… everyone seems busy or hard to reach lately (i hope you can relate lol)

I have ADHD and can be super bubbly and chatty when I vibe with someone—so if you’ve got good energy and can match that, we’ll probably get along great.

At the moment, I normally wear sunglasses as I’m getting ready for a prosthetic eye. It’s been a hit to my self-esteem. But otherwise, I’m feeling good physically—just need a reason to get out and connect.

I’m specifically looking for platonic friendship—so if you’re hoping for FWB or anything romantic, this won’t be the right fit. I know it’s a bit awkward to spell out, but it matters to me for personal reasons. Ideally, I’d love to connect with a hetero female or someone aromantic/asexual, but I’m open as long as we’re both on the same page about the ‘friends only’ thing.

I’m a little immature for my age in the best way—I like seeing the world with childlike curiosity. I won’t ask for favors or money—I’m just genuinely excited to meet someone who likes random niche interests like geography, history, physics, or anything obscure and fun.

Let’s share our weird interests while we craft, sip tea or coffee, go hiking, do some light thrifting or urban wandering, or take photos. I especially love collecting seashells and painting them. I usually take public transport or scoot around on my electric scooter, and if we ever go on a longer trip, I’ll always offer to split gas.

If this sounds like your kind of vibe, please DM me! I’m only accepting messages from people around the Seattle  area I can hang out with in person and those who already share the same interests as me.
