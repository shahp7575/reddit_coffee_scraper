1pb3krz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Friends/comments/1pb3krz/28_m4a_this_is_the_start_of_the_story_of_how_ill/,28 [M4A] This is the start of the story of how I’ll meet my best bro,"Recently, I have been a social guy.

I am running out of single friends. People are getting married, having children, having anniversaries. Even my go-to-single-friend who used to rant “It’s impossible to find a decent guy here in our city” is already taken. Even my used-to-be-Casanova best friend is in a long committed relationship.

I am at the point where I am the go-to abay / best dude and best ninong. They are still my closest friends, but lately I’ve been craving for single older friends who know what it’s like being “out there” still. My friends are giving me conflicting advices (which all have truth in it) and you know it’s a bit much. They like my dating escapades but at some point I swear it’s half interest / half pity that’s why they’re listening.

I am more of a Ted. I make good sitcom references often, I do the planning often, I play a plethora of pc games, I sneak in humor often, knows good foods inside and outside Metro Manila, prefers a good beer / coffee and just sitting in a pub talking about recent observations and epiphanies.

Obviously, I am just eyeing to form a circle or bro-it-up with another single dude on the same boat. I am happy with my relationship between family and friends, good with my career; it’s just this business of finding “the one” that’s been a major moot point. I am outside MM, but I prefer to make friends and hang out in Metro so I can fit in a good hang out time before/after other mundane tasks I do sometimes in the city.

I am a good listener as I am a good narrator. This is just really about finding friends who are willing their stories and as enthusiastic to hear they’re not alone.

DM. If you make short responses, it’s often hard to be interested to reply to; same irl. But you find some sort of kinship with this post, let’s chat.",1,1764564042.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I told him that I had a girlfriend (mtf24) and he asked if i'd be interested still platonically. I said yes, gave him my number and then over text asked if my girlfriend could join us. My girlfriend and i are actually open to dating men together but I didn't want to bring this up at work. We eventually met up for coffee and had a great time.

He is soooo attractive and my girlfriend and i both like him, but after he met with both of us i'm not sure how to bring up what he's interested in. It seemed to us like he thought of it as a date. When i met him at my job he was dressed in all sweats. When we met for coffee he was dressed up nice head to toe with his hair done, he hugged both of us and paid for our drinks and laughed at everything we said and was all smiley. At the end he hugged us goodbye and squeezed us both tight.
My girlfriend is worried he is not interested in her.

They talked about being the same height in the beginning (6'3) and he didn't seem weird about it, and her being trans was sort of alluded to as well.
SO it went well but I'm not sure if he's just trying to be nice but isn't interested in either of us, my girlfriends, or if he is into us. And if he is, how can I initiate a conversation? or at least a groupchat haha.

I’m setting up a small, cozy, invite-only café/community spot at my place — something super relaxed, warm, and personal. Think of it as a hybrid of a tiny café, a chill workspace, and a hangout lounge for like-minded people.

Here’s what the space offers:

☕ Great coffee + a comfortable, aesthetic vibe

🎮 PlayStation corner for casual gaming

📚 A mini reading nook with books

💻 A quiet zone where you can work or unwind

🌿 A calm, welcoming, no-judgement environment

🤝 Small group, community-first feel — not a commercial cafe


This is invite-only, and I want to curate a friendly, respectful, chill crowd.
If you’re someone who enjoys slow mornings, conversations, games, and a homely vibe, this space might be for you.

If you want to know how it works, DM me and I’ll share the details.

1pb3hy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1pb3hy7/my_routine_was_interrupted/,My routine was interrupted,"
I wake up, I put on my work shoes, I go to work, I eat my bagel and salami sandwich at 12:34 pm everyday Tuesday. I close down my tabs and send my end of the day emails and head back home. 

I don't mind it, I actually look forward to the mundane, I learned very early on when I was a teenager that I needed the structure. I needed to be invisible, blend in with everyone else doing their everyday tasks while I just zone out and complete my day. 

Today was different though. I went to work, Becky was a bitch as always and I smiled and nodded when she complained about her numberous phishing emails and how opposing her husband was to her existence. 
Rachel talked on and on about the newest guy she was fucking after work on Thursday nights. Jim was as boring and as ignorant as he has been since his divorce.
I refused to get into a relationship for this reason, I didn't want to turn into someone that is blogged about or tweeted about. Being gay in the city was fun, from what I heard. But honestly I could just open a tab whenever my primal desires needed to be fulfilled. 

The clock hit 12:29 and I closed my last excel tab, locked my computer and put it inside of my bag. Tucking it over my shoulder and putting in my headphones, I went down the elevator and ordered my usual from the bakery down the street. A coffee with two shots of espresso, and a bagel with cream cheese and salami. 
It hit the spot, and has every Tuesday for the past ninteen months. 

I picked up my bagel and coffee, sipping it slowly as I walked out the glass door, careful not to spill any on my shirt. 
The air was light today, and the sun shined quite lovely so I decided to break my routine, just this once. I went to the park across the street and sat down on a bench to enjoy my lunch before going back to the ruthless coworkers and my okay job. My therapist recommended I switch things up at least once a week. I had gotten one ever since my brother passed away a year ago, the funeral director mentioned it could help, I am still unsure if I see any benefits from it, but now it's part of my routine. 

I was sitting there, thinking about how the breeze was nice, I usually was always cold but there was something nice about today. I heard a rustle behind me, it was quant and soft but nonetheless I turned my head to the left to see a man with a bushy grey beard standing directly over me, smiling. His pants were undone and he held his penis in his hands and a knife in the other. He slid the blade into his stomach and tore the flesh apart swiftly. Brown and dark red blood spilled across me, it ingulfed me like a fire. Have you ever opened an oven door after it has been on for an hour, and you're surprised and thrown back by the wave of heat, even though you know it's an oven and that's exactly what it's made for, to get hot. I had a similar feeling, I was surprised and shocked by the amount of blood that came onto me. It sloshed down my face, covering my ears and sliding into my mouth. I felt a long, bulky group of intestines flop onto my shoulder and I heard the man moan before falling onto me. His fat, open body knocked me onto the ground. I had braced myself instinctaily by putting my hands up in front of me, but they only slid into his body like a new coat, or a long sleeve shirt out of the dryer. 

I fell and smacked the back of my head on the ground, even more of the blood covered me now. I could taste it, it smelled of iron and waste. I shuffled and got out from the man and sat there as a passerbye screamed and a mother with her child in her arms yelled as if she had just been attacked herself. But I sat on the ground, silent. 

The police came and took me in, they had questions for me but I didn't know how to answer them. Who was the man, had I ever seen him before, what was I doing before he approached me, did he say anything to me. So many questions, and no answers. They summed it up to a random act of violence and after a long, long day they sent me on my way. 

Work gave me a week off, and sent me card for free therapy sessions. I got home and my best friend called me, she was crying and asking me again and again if I was okay but I couldn't get a word out. All I could think about was how warm it was when I was inside of the man. 

I spent my time that week just in bed, reading, trying not to think about it. But everything was so cold, so damn cold. I huddled up in hoodies, drank warm soup, even bought an overpriced space heater that was supposedly 'on sale'. But nothing quite felt the same as being inside the empty body. 

It was two days before I was supposed to go back to work, and Jim had called me, asking how I was doing. I had never talked to Jim outside of work, I honestly forgot we were even friends on social media, he deleted all of his posts after his divorce so I never saw his stuff. But he was kind with his words and asked how I was and if I wanted to get some food, on him. Jim was most definitely straight, but he was cute and I was cold, I thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad to break my routine just once more this week on my own valuation and go out to eat. 

Jim was kind and took me to a restaurant he knew I enjoyed, we sat and ate and he even made me laugh. We talked for awhile, much longer than I expected and by his facial expressions longer than he expected to be out. I, I wanted him to come home with me. I don't know if I wanted Jim to hold me, or fuck me. But I wanted him in my home. 

I was able to convince Jim that I hadn't been able to get my laundry done after the incident, and asked for help. Jim was hesitant, but agreed. We walked into my apartment and I offered him a drink, he politely accepted and we drank a little and he was making small talk before I grabbed his wrist and leaned in. I was still holding the wine bottle and I needed this. Jim pushed me away, calling me all sorts of things but I couldn't hear anything. I smacked Jim across the temple with the bottle and let his long body hit the ground. I carried him to the tub and laid his body into it. It was fucking heavy, I never expected anything to be so heavy. But it was and it was over now, I turned the water on and I let him soak. 
I sat on the toilet and got myself off, while watching Jim be cleaned by the spout. 

I let Jim sit in the water for a day, I had to keep refilling the tub, I think I did it three times. 
Jim was so much softer by the third time. And I was still so cold. I got out a small carving knife that I usually used for apricots and slit open Jim's chest. I enjoyed emptying him, I took a wrench from under my sink and smashed his bones up so I could make more room in my new little nest. I wished I had a hammer, but sometimes you have to just use what you have. 

It took some time, and a few trash bags but I got a good hole in Jim, and then crawled inside of it. I had never felt so warm. I imagined this is how a baby feels when laying on its mother for the first time. I had never felt such pleasure.

I heard the phone ring from on top of the bathroom counter. I shifted my weight and heard a slosh of the wet and torn apart skin of my nest and got aroused. I barely made it to the phone before it automatically sent the caller to voicemail. It was Rachel, she was asking to go out to talk before work the next day, and I think I just might go. Maybe I'll even make it part of my routine. ",1,1764563793.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1pb3dow,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Individual-Peak9494/comments/1pb3dow/ny/,Ny,"""How long have you been fucking Timmy for?"" asked Philip.


""For a couple of years, ever since his mother walked out on us, what
about you and Ryan?"" I asked.


""After his mother ran away with another woman last year. I came home
early from work and caught him and the baby sitter sucking each others
cock. I ended up sucking both their young cocks. From that day onward,
Ryan slept in my bed,"" replied Philip.


""Do you still see the baby sitter?"" I asked.


""I wish I did he had a lovely cock, but he and his parents moved away,""
replied Philip.


""Whose Ryan's baby now?"" I asked.


""A neighbours teenage daughter. Whose Timmy's baby sitter?"" asked
Philip.


""A woman from down the street,"" I replied.


With both our cocks rock hard again, we went to check on our boys. We
found them laying on the bed in a sixty nine position sucking each others
cock. As soon as they had both cum and had removed their mouths from each
others cock, Philip and I entered the bedroom and moved over to the side
of the bed.


Philip turned Timmy onto his knees and then covered his asshole in lube
and used two fingers to stretch open his asshole. After finger fucking
his young ass for a few minutes, Philip covered his cock in lube then
thrust his hard cock into Timmy's asshole and started furiously fucking
him.


When I held out my hands to Ryan, he crawled over to me and took my hard
cock into his mouth. I took hold of his head with both hands and began to
pump my cock in and out of his mouth, face fucking him at a furious pace.


After face fucking Ryan for several minutes, I said, ""Get on your
knees.""


When I pushed his head down into a pillow to muffle his screams and saw
the gaping hole in his ass that his father had previous made dripping
with cum. I covered my cock in his father's cum then drove my hard cock
deep into his ten-year-old ass.


Ryan gasped and moaned and took several deep breaths as I pumped my cock
in and out of his young boy pussy. I was surprised at how tight his young
ass gripped onto my cock. With my cock being milked by Ryan's boy pussy,
it wasn't long before I was squirting my hot sticky cum into his young
ass.


On the bed beside me was Philip fucking my young son, I could see that
Timmy kept pushing his ass back to meet Philips inward thrusts, just like
he did at home. My young son loved having a cock in his boy pussy. It
wasn't long before Philip blasted his hot cum into my son's ass.


When Philip removed his limp soft cock from Timmy's ass he said, ""You
two boys go take a shower in the spare bathroom and I will phone up for
pizzas to be delivered.""


""Yippee,"" cried both boys.


""Travis you can take a shower and freshen up in my bathroom,"" said
Philip.


After finishing taking a shower and drying myself, I came out of the
bathroom to find Philip had left out a bathrobe for me. I threw on the
bathrobe and went to find Philip. I found him in the kitchen wearing a
bathrobe making a fresh cup of coffee.


""Travis do you want a cup of coffee?"" he asked.


""Yes please,"" I replied.


After pouring me a cup of coffee he said, ""I'm going to take a quick
shower.""


Five minutes later he returned from having a shower wearing the bathrobe.
The doorbell rang, Philip went to answer the door, he returned to the
kitchen with a young pizza delivery man carrying several boxes of pizzas
and placed them on the table.


""How much do I owe you?"" asked Philip.


Before he could reply, Ryan and Timmy came walking into the kitchen naked
and with their cocks hard. The young pizza delivery man lost for words
stood staring at our naked boys.


""Do you like what your seeing?"" chuckled Philip.


""Uh uh, oh yes,"" replied the young pizza delivery man.


""Boys why don't you help the pizza delivery man undress?"" said Philip.


As our sons lowered his pants and underwear down to his ankles, he closed
his eyes as if he was having a dream. When his hard cock sprung out,
Timmy and Ryan dropped to their knees and began taking turns sucking on
his throbbing cock.


After Philip and I slipped our bathrobes off, the pizza delivery man
reached out with both hands and wrapped his hands around our hard cocks
and start stroking our cocks as our sons continued to take turns sucking
his cock.


A few minutes later he was crying out, ""I'm going to cum.""


With their mouths open both our sons fought with each other to see who
was going to get his cum. As his cock exploded he covered their faces in
cum. When he had finished coming, he dropped to his knees and took
Philip's cock into his mouth and began sucking his cock.


After Philip had squirted his cum into the young pizza man's mouth and
down his throat. He took my cock into his mouth to suck. It wasn't long
before I was squirting my hot cum into his mouth and down his throat.


When he stood and pulled up his pants and underwear, he said, ""Now I
better get back to my father's shop. If you phone for another pizza
delivery ask for Angelo.""


""How much do we owe you for the pizzas?"" asked Philip.


""Nothing, they're free for sharing your boys with me,"" said Angelo.


Philip and I took Angelo to the front door and opened the door for him to
leave. When we returned to the kitchen our boys were attacking the pizzas
as if they hadn't been feed in weeks.


I chuckled, ""We might have to order more pizzas.""


""That's a good idea,"" replied Philip.


After we had finished eating, it was decided that seeing tomorrow was
Saturday, Timmy and I would stay the night. Timmy would sleep with Philip
in his bedroom in his queen size bed. Ryan would sleep with me in the
spare bedroom with the double bed. We decided to go to bed early, the
last I saw of my son that night was Philip taking him into his bedroom.


I've never met a ten-year-old boy that eager for sex, he sucked one of
my testicles into his mouth and licked up and down the shaft of my cock.
When he took my cock deep into his mouth, I placed my hand on his head to
keep his mouth on my cock. My cock exploded a minute later shooting my
hot cum into his mouth and down his throat.

But consistency doesn’t start when the market opens, it starts with what you do before it.

Here’s my exact morning routine that keeps me sharp and emotionally neutral before every trading session:

4:30 AM – Wake Up (2 hrs before market open)

Just movement, get vertical, hydrate, and reset.

4:40 AM – Cold shower

Instantly wake up the body. Reminds me I’m in control before the market even opens.

4:50 AM – Light cardio or stretching (15-20 min)

Nothing crazy. Just enough to get blood flowing and mind alert. A moving body makes for a focused trader. I do have sciatica issues, so I do focus a lot on back and hip mobility.

5:15 AM – Breathwork (4-7-8 pattern, 10 cycles) or (4-4-4-4 box breathing)

Inhale 4 sec

Hold 7 sec

Exhale 8 sec

It’s simple, but it flips your nervous system from reactive to calm, which is where all good trading happens.

6:00 AM – Black coffee + silence

No screens yet. I let caffeine hit while staying off stimulation.

6:30 AM – Game Plan Review

No trades before open. I use this time to:

Review my pre-written game plan (done night before)

Insomnia, Tuckercaust, Blue Wave, Shutdown","I had severe insomnia as my thyroid pills disappeared during a room renovation. I couldn't afford to buy more out of pocket. So for about ten days I was barely able to sleep an hour at a time. Body just wasn't sleepy. Made my mind useless.  
  
It has now become obvious to me that far to many talking heads, whether they be on msm, youbtube or the like, are being paid to shill for Israel. Tucker Carlson is not one Candace Owens is becoming famous for it, neither was Charlie Kirk in his final days. Many believe they killed him for it. So now are spending much effort defaming; the Tuckercaust, rather than addressing real issues.Trying to silence the opposition is a fascist tactic. Addressing issues is noble. The issue shouldn't be what the other guy is saying; it should be what the politicians are doing and saying, what's happening in their areas of concern.  
The fact that the more than the supermajority of congress takes money from Israel, display it's flag, visit and kiss the wall, and consistently vote in favor of Israeli policies concerns me greatly.AIPAC is a foreign entity and should be forced to register as such. The infiltration is so bad, I now think dual citizenship for elected and appointed officials should be banned. I used to think of Winston Churchill who was given an American citizenship as a thanks for his massive war effort. I now think all government (federal, state and local) positions and employees must be only American citizens and any exception should require a specific act of congress naming the individual(s).  
  
The Republican shellacking due to the current establishment paying more attention the ending foreign wars and declaring victory over economy based perhaps on stock market I guess because all real factors I see is economy sucks and continues to suck harder. And I don't just mean usn'ins what's on ssi and snap, though we have hard suck, harder than most. Trump and crew need to focus on mainstreet and the poor.  
  
Pecan pie season and my local-ish (Marlton) Aldi's has great pies (better than Shop-Rite). Cheap and with the full nutty flavor of the season. Reminds me of Alberstson's back in 95' they had the pies for $5.99 on sale reg price $7.99. Used to buy cool whip and Columbian specialty coffee, ground in store to a very fine mist, which I made at maximum strength and sat in front of the tv after returning from work at Taco Hell. I watched either what was on including the Late Late show with Tom Snyder or movie rentals from 16,000 videos. Good Times. First Job as an 'adult,' I put in quotes as though I was 18 I was behind the maturity curve. This was partly due to my narcissistic mother and my reaction to it, partly due to the government education system and my reaction to that.  
  
The government shutdown wouldn't have bothered if I wasn't on ebt/snap. I am disabled on ssi and rely on snap to eat. Otherwise I'd be stuck going to the local food banks, which doesn't always offer the most nutritious foods. Being able to shop on my own, I am able to get the high protein diet my blood type requires. And I do occasionally buy myself a bottle of soda, candy around Halloween, Christmas and easter. I remember back in the 90's some pukes in congress arguing that food stamp recipients shouldn't be able to buy steak and the fda along with lobbyists argueing that steak is healthy. All that came out of that nonsense is outlawing steaks for prisoners. To get around that provison, federal prsioners on new years day have 'meat for grilling.' Neener.  
  
For all who would do research on Larry Reese, Founder of Gruntled: He is a liar, cheat, thief, scammer and general cunt. Do not trust him, ever. He only desires to have orgies, smoke weed and get drunk. He claims compassion, he espouses genreousity, but cannot maintain a stable household. Anything given to him will be waisted at this point in time. Someday, maybe, he'll be a champion of light. For now he is a possessed man, deluded and dangerous, probable rapist. I never wished to say this here. He may someday be cured, become the solution he dreams of being but first he must become the man capable of bringing forth that soullution. All else is folly. He is also known as Larry J Reese or Larrry Joeseph Reese. He is a top result when searching in the Philadelphia region and is no longer wanted by Septa.  
  
I'm so exited Stargate is returning. The original producers are also onboard which gives me hope it won't be crap. What we MUST have: definative end to Destiy, explanation as to what they did with Altanits. Highly recommended: Incarceration or cure to all wraith, showing changes on parallel Earth (to our own) with technological changes. Beoucops cameos (include characters even if different actors such as Cassandra (viva Katie Stuart)). One Liners. Rplicators in bug form eating and assilimilating. Good Ideas: show the evolution of technology: Tau'ri finallaly figure out how to make drones, stargates and zed'pee'ems. Vanier return. Ori weren't the Ancents only enemy. Radical Ideas: most of congress taken over by symbiots, neither Gua'old nor Tok'ra but a third snake. Rodney figuring out a instant time/space transporter whcih can deleiver people anyplace, any time and it all goes sideways due to Ra or Appophis. There are more Bal's. Destiny discovers more enemies and they come for Earth.  
Farscape: did me a full rewatch. Damn that's good. Top tier sci-fi. MOAR! So much potential: if I had unlimited funding I'd have Dago, son of Chricton, as my lead launching from Rigel the XVII'th's palace on Moya to rescue someone. Scarran and Peackeepers back at war? Everyone going to earth for birds of paradise palnts. (In a cartoon have a crossover with Lexx). Maybe when they visted Earth a blaster was left behind and reverse engeneering it advances Earth's tech 100 years. For me it'd be about getting the rights and then actors. I could write every episode meself, I gauruntee.  
  
Top ten things I learned in school that I now know aren't true, to some biterness on my part.  
10: Salt is inherently bad for you.  
9: Margarine is a more healthy alternative to butter.  
8: Red meat is bad for you.  
7: High cholesterol is worse than the medications that addresses it.  
6: Doctors try to heal; no they practice medicine not healing.  
5: Non-heterosexuals have something wrong with them.  
4: Sexual abstinance is the best policy.  
3: Vaccines are safe and effective.  
2: There is no evidence of extraterrestrials nor psychic phenomina.  
1: The number of people that died at Aushwitz.The evidence of continous mass killing there is absent.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I am an NCL girl but I am not liking the options for their itineraries coming up around the time I plan to cruise next so I'm branching out and considering a new line.  Celebrity is getting closer and closer to being the one I pick.  But, as always, I'm overwhelmed by the new information as I research.   

Considering an itinerary on the Eclipse and going solo if this helps....

1.  I understand with Celebrity you can bring some of your own soda on board.  12 pack?  How does this work?  I know you have to carry it on with you but is worth it to bring my favorite (and unavailable) Dr Pepper with me?   which brings me to....

2.  I have read that you can go right to your cabin when you board to drop off your carry on (and the aforementioned soda) as well as get your key card - rather than lug your stuff around with you (as I do now on NCL) -- but then you leave so they can finish cleaning.  Is this correct or do you lug around your carryon and such half the day?

3.  If I saved a little $$ and went with an inside cabin over a balcony (I do love a balcony) - are there (not massively crowded) public spaces you can sit to enjoy the view like NCL has with their Observation Lounge or Waterfront areas?  Or should I just suck up that extra $$ and get a balcony? 

4.  How is the included coffee?  NCL always had a Starbucks which was extra $ but worth it as the ship-offered coffee was...not great.   I see they have NA package that includes the Cafe al Bacio coffees.  I don't drink alcohol but I *need* my cup-o-Joe.  

Also any general information you lovelies want to impart to a Celebrity Newbie?  Always much appreciated.  Thank you! ",2,1764563142.0,celebritycruises,2,1.0,False

1pb39lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tamilyapping/comments/1pb39lq/the_best_weekend_in_a_long_time/,the best weekend in a long time!,"this is gonna be one long post lol. ok so i just wanted to share this and here I am. I(25M) started talking to this girl(23F) a couple of days ago and our vibes kinda hit off since day 1. we both had similar intention when it came to dating, and thats one of the reason she agreed to talk to me. she says she doesn't talk much and I used to say I yap but on calls, it'd be the opposite almost half the time. and our interests also are lil opposite, maybe opposite poles attract? idk lol. so we planned to meet over last weekend but there was a sudden change of plans. so I had to improvise and go to a friend's place and we decided to get drunk. I usually wake up early so around 6 in the morning on sat, I woke up and texted her..and she was up too! she called me(i asked her to, the night before) and asked if I wanted to meet her near her place. i agreed obv. it was drizzling so I took an umbrella and reached there. 

we met for the first time and my god I had to say this, she was so pretty!! the rain, her black dress, her wet hair, her smile, and the way she looked at me the first time - enough to make a grown man fall off his feet like hes been off his meds(bad pun ig). I literally almost fumbled saying my name lol. she was kinda hesitant in meeting initially as she just woke up too and she hasn't got ready and whatnot and I was still a lil tipsy as well lol. but glad we both decided to meet up! we were talking for a while, shared her headphones and listened to her playlist the whole time and then decided to get coffee nearby. we walked to this nearby Cafe, drank coffee and I dropped her off to her place as it started to rain and I had an umbrella. she got into her apt elevator and left and i was standing there, waiting to leave but wishing the time had frozen still.

so then, we both carried on with our day and one of my friend said he wanted to drink with us as he's leaving for work and will not be around for a while. I was hesitant since I drank the night before but ultimately agreed. I usually have a high alcohol tolerance and I can handle my liquor quite good. so it was raining and I decided to drink not much, just enough to not feel the chillness. so around midnight, I was texting her and she said she's planning to clean her room but couldn't. I asked her if she wants my help and she asked if im being serious. I said ""yeah, I dont mind coming over, sweep and mop the place. Just that im lil drunk so if thats not a problem I dont mind"". she said in the morning that her house has this ""no men allowed"" policy so she had to think a while which is fair. 

she asked how will I reach her place and I said ill book a rapido cuz my friends are also drunk and we cant dnd. she agreed and I reached her place in a while..it was drizzling again. she looked as pretty as ever, and I, well, showed up drunk again lmao. i sat in the far corner of her bed and we were talking. this time, I played my playlist lol. so we talked a while, then stared to clean her room by dusting off the dirt from her shelves and cupboards, then we took a break, ordered burgers and ate it, then swept the room, then a small break, then mopped her room! then we took out the trash, and then she asked me to help her with setting up the fairy lights around her room. once all the work is done, the room looked so pretty(not more than her ofc😛) and she thanked me for it. she asked me how am I this steady and conscious when drunk and I said I can handle my alcohol pretty good - she didnt believe i was drunk. then we were yapping for a bit, shared few lores abt each other, shared our childhood pics and stories, and then both of us were lil exhausted as its almost 5 am. I asked her if I should leave, now that the room cleaning is done but she told to leave around 7 as her roomie might come home post that. so we agreed and I decided to sleep at her place for couple of hours. I woke up at 7, she said go by 8, then at 8 she said by 9😂 then at 930 we woke up and decided to leave. we refreshed and we went out to drink juice instead of coffee. then I dropped her back at her place, said my byes and started to head back home!

im not sure if its beyond the typical dating norms but I considered it as one, with our first date as an ice breaker one(the one near her place) and the second one as house cleaning date(her place). it was a good weekend overall and I cant believe its over just like every other weekends(too soon). I wish all seven days of the week are weekends😮‍💨 so yeah, thats how i had the best weekend in a while. 

and to the girl, idk if you'd read this, but, trust me when I say this..youre so beautiful, esp when u smile. and I'm glad I was able to make u smile, laugh as much! and the fact that you met me both the times even when im drunk shows the level of trust you have on me and ill never break it. I just wish I had enough time to cook u the dishes I promised u lol. next time maybe ;p

thanks for taking time to read it. hope yall have a good week!! and month too(as its the first of the month!)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pb3826,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1pb3826/divorced_will_be_finalized_in_two_weeks_any_ideas/,Divorced will be finalized in two weeks. Any ideas on what to do that day?,"I was married for 13 years and dated for 4. I was with him for 17 years all together. He cheated on me the first year of our marriage. I forgave him because hey, everyone makes mistakes, right? 

He ended up getting locked up because the girl was underaged. He did 5 years in prison and maintained a communication with me throughout the time. He seemed like he had changed and truly regretted his actions and behavior. Now looking back, I find myself hating myself for giving him the benefit of the doubt. 

Long story short, he came out of prison. I took him back. He started from scratch. He built himself up from the bottom with my help. I opened the doors to my house. We started to go to church together and so I thought we were in a “good place.” He had ups and downs but we would worth through our problems and get back to working on “us.” 

I had my first miscarriage two years ago and after that, wasn’t able to get pregnant again. He didn’t really seemed excited about me being pregnant. It was weird. He seems as if I had told him I had gotten a new pair of shoes. But, I thought he was just not use to showing or expressing his emotions. I  had a miscarriage three months after I found out I was pregnant and again, he seems as if I had my period and just had to lay in bed. 

Two years passed after my miscarriage and I wasn’t able to get pregnant again. I was hesitant to really try to get pregnant. I always had a gut feeling he would do me dirty even though I had no proof of anything. In March of this year, I found out that for a hole year, he had been emailing a girl who came forward and told me because she thought I “deserved better.” She never replied back because she knew he was married and knew me. She decided to come out and say something because he went ahead and got her number from my phone and called her to invite her to go grab a “coffee.” 

I was in complete shock when I was told and saw his emails to her. She had the proof on her phone and kept it for her record and because according to her, she knew one day, it was going to come out to light. 

When I found out, I didn’t tell him anything. I went on and carried on as if I didn’t know. He only came home on the weekends due to work so it was easy. I didn’t text him as usual so he could tell something was wrong but never grew a pair and confess his wrongdoing. 

I remained being distant for two weeks when,to my surprise, I get a call from another woman late at night, while he was working, telling me that if I knew my husband had been messing around with her daughter. I immediately call him and barely being able to talk, I cry out if it true that he’s been cheating on me. He denies the hole thing and tells me that how am I able to believe such a thing that he loves me yada,yada,yada.

I end up filing for divorce two weeks later. Will be finalized in two weeks. I miss him, a lot. He was my best friend and for the most part, he was always there for me. He was my to go person and I could be 100% myself. Something I’m not capable of doing around just anyone. I’m in denial and feel numb most of the time. I work and I’m able to forget about everything while at work (k- teacher) but afternoons, weekends, recent holidays are another level of pain. 

I am hesitant and feel a different kind of pain about everything being officially over and done with. I know it’s for the best but still, how do you tell that to your heart and reprogram your brain to on un-attach to a person that was your whole world for 17 years?

Please help me before I lose my mind lol. 

Currently I have a pair of Audio techinca M50x that I bought back in college for making music. They're fine and have gotten the job done, but definitely bored of listening to music using them. I also have a pair of galaxy buds which I dislike, but only use them in bed or when I'm traveling. 

I'm looking for a pair of over-ear headphones to listen to music with. I'm strongly leaning towards closed backs as my partner doesn't like being able to hear my music and it'd be nice to have the option of bringing them somewhere public like a coffee shop.  But I could possibly be sold on a really solid pair of open backs.

I prefer a flatter sound, but I don't necessarily need super flat studio monitors or anything. I dislike heavy/ overemphasized bass that headphones like Beats have. Overall, want a well balanced, full, clear sound.

I don't care much about noise canceling, and there's a good chance I would turn it off most of the time. Originally I was thinking I wanted Bluetooth, but if I can get better sound quality for a lower price point, I am 1000% fine with wired. I'll be plugging them straight into my phone and laptop, no amp.

As for the music I listen to, it's really all over the place, so headphones that sound great no matter what you're listening to.

1pb33zz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb33zz,Looking to buy a holding station [No budget],"Hi all,

I’m looking to buy my parter a tamper station as a gift and, unfortunately, know next to nothing about coffee.

She has a number of sage accessories (seen in image two) as well as a few other bits and bobs and they end up cluttering our kitchen space.  Now I know that she is a huge fan of sage products, but unfortunately I can’t see any such thing on their website.   I was hoping that I could have some suggestions on alternative brands that would work - basically where the accessories would fit and look somewhat nice…

The diameter I need is 54mm (I don’t know how relevant that is) and a walnut colour as seen in the example on image one would be great.

On another note,  if you (as a coffee drinker) feel that this kind of item is totally unnecessary and you would rather not have it… please let me know as I don’t want to get a dud gift 😅",2,1764562605.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pb32lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Individual-Peak9494/comments/1pb32lk/ny/,Ny,"His face lit up and he smiled for the first time, which made him look even
cuter than before. Within seconds, he was out of his seat and buckled in
next to me. I raised the armrest between us, allowing him to scoot a little
closer. When I offered him my right hand, he grabbed it right away and held
it tight. He even put his head on my shoulder, closing his eyes, so I put
my left arm around him and held him tight. I could feel his body shaking,
but it seemed to me that he was calming down already.

""We're about ready to take off now."" I softly told him as we were waiting
at the end of the runway. ""The engines will make a little noise now, and
before you know it, we'll be up in the air. Oh, here we go!""

He squeezed my hand when the engines started to howl. Then the pilot
released the breaks, the plane accelerated down the runway and seconds
later we were in the air. The higher we climbed, the more he relaxed. His
grip on my hand loosened and I could feel his heartbeat slowing down. He
opened his eyes at about 10000 feet, and by the time we passed the 20000
feet mark, he was sitting up straight in his seat again. He was still
holding my hand though, and I wasn't going to tell him to let
go. Eventually we reached our cruising altitude of 30000 feet.

""Thank you!"" he said, smiling at me. ""I don't know why I was so nervous
about flying. I mean, I know about the physics and stuff, and that it's
pretty much the safest way to travel. But as I said, it's my first time on
a plane, and my first trip outside the US. Thank you so much for letting me
hold your hand! That really helped a lot.""

""You're very welcome!"" I replied, winking at him. ""I actually enjoyed it. I
don't get as many opportunities to hold hands with cute guys as I would
like.""

He blushed and giggled, but still didn't let go. We finally introduced
ourselves, and I learned that his name was James, though he told me to call
him Jamie. His older brother was a soldier with the US army, stationed in
Rammstein in Germany, and he was going to visit him for a few weeks during
his summer break. I was familiar with the area because I had done my
mandatory service in the German army not far from there, and I actually
lived only an hours train ride away. As we were talking, I found myself
being drawn to his amazing green eyes. Bright eyes are a huge turn on for
me, so it was not surprising that my dick was stirring in my pants. I kept
sneaking glances at his crotch too, but his jeans didn't give anything
away.

Eventually cabin service started, and only then did he let go of my
hand. We got our pretzels and he had a coke while I opted for red wine. A
short time later, they served dinner; chicken or pasta, as usual. One of
the advantages of transatlantic flights is that alcohol is complimentary,
even in economy class, so I could have another glass of wine. And when I
asked the flight attendant for a fun sized bottle of Baileys to go with my
after dinner coffee, James shyly asked if he could have one too. Since we
were flying with a German airline, the flight attendant gave it to him
without batting an eye.

""It's too bad that you couldn't have a drink before getting on the plane.""
I said. ""That would have relaxed you a bit. Next time just take a quick
trip to the restroom and jerk off. I always find that very relaxing.""

Jamie snorted and laughed. The shutters were already closed and the cabin
was getting ready for the night, so it was hard to tell if he was blushing
again. But I couldn't help but notice that he was subconsciously rubbing
and adjusting his crotch.

""Actually,"" he whispered, leaning close to me, ""I could do it right
now. I'm kinda horny now, without all that anxiety.""

""Bathroom is that way!"" I pointed over my shoulder to the back of the
plane. ""Knock yourself out!""

He looked back, then turned around and grinned wickedly at me. I looked at
him questioningly when he reclined the seat. He ripped open the plastic bag
with the airline blanket and covered his lap with the blanket. There was
some movement under the blanket and the distinct sound of a zipper being
opened. Only then did I realize what Jamie was up to.

""Did you just ..."" I started to ask.

Jamie just kept grinning and lifted the blanket on my side a little, giving
me a great view at a nice uncut teenage boner. I quickly looked around, but
there was no other passenger within a couple of rows, and no flight
attendant either.

""You can touch it, if you like."" He said.

I was still hesitating, so Jamie grabbed my hand and put it under the
blanket, right on top of his dick. He leaned back and closed his
eyes. Jamie's dick was slim, like the rest of his body, and not too
long. But it felt great in my hand, so hard and hot. He had hooked his
underwear under his balls and pulled his t-shirt up a bit, so I gently
rubbed his soft belly before moving my hand back down. I could feel a small
patch of pubes and wondered if they were the same ginger color as the hair
on his head. It was too dark to be sure now.

Pulling back the foreskin, I started to slowly jerk him off. He kept his
eyes close, but his smile grew even bigger. As I was picking up speed,
Jamie's breathing became faster too. I could feel some precum when I softly
rubbed the head of his dick with my thumb. Not wanting him to finish too
quickly, I fondled his balls for a bit, then trailed the soft skin below
them until I touched his butthole. He didn't complain about it, but I
didn't want to get carried away and go too far. After all, someone could
walk by on their way to the bathroom at any time. So I went back to his
dick, which felt even harder now, and continued to wank him. In less than a
minute, he erupted all over my hand and himself.

When his dick finally stopped pumping out cum, I pulled my hand out from
under the blanket. It was covered with Jamie's juices. I hungrily licked it
all off, and it tasted even sweeter than the Baileys.

""Wow, that was intense!"" Jamie sighed. ""Thank you!""

""You're welcome"" I replied. ""And thank you too. That was certainly a
surprising and unexpected treat for me.""

""I don't normally do something like that either. But after you comforted me
earlier, I feel really close to you, and it just felt right.""

""I feel the same way, buddy!"" I said and hugged him tight.

""Well, I better go clean up a bit."" Jamie said, rearranged his clothes and
got out of his seat. He walked a couple of steps toward the bathroom, then
turned back to me. ""You know, I don't think anyone would notice if you
joined me in the bathroom.""

Without another word, Jamie walked to the back of the plane and vanished in
the bathroom. I looked around, wondering what to do. My dick certainly knew
what it wanted, but my brain was a little more careful. I listened to the
monotone drone of the engines for a couple of moments. The back part of the
plane was really quiet. Nobody sitting near me appeared to be awake. So I
decided to follow the advice of the smaller head and headed to the bathroom
too. Knocking lightly on the door I quietly said, ""Jamie?"" There was a soft
click when the door was unlocked.

I pushed open the door and my jaw almost hit the ground. Jamie was standing
there completely naked, wearing only a broad grin on his freckled face. His
dick was rock hard again, pointing straight up. And the small patch of
neatly trimmed pubes was indeed the same ginger color as the hair on his
head. Shaking off my initial surprise, I quickly entered the bathroom and
locked the door behind me. Jamie was leaning on the small counter, pushing
out his slim hips. ""Come and get me, I'm all yours!"" his body language was
telling me. I was only too happy to accept that invitation.

Stepping close to him I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him in for a
hug. He felt so small and soft in my arms, but he was hugging me back hard
and I could feel the strength in his slim body. And of course the hardness
of his dick. I put my hands on his chest and gently pinched his small but
very hard nipples. Running my hands further down his torso, I could feel
the beginnings of a six pack beneath the soft skin of his belly. There was
still some warm cum sticking to it.

I went down on my knees and deeply inhaled the horny boy smell emanating
from his crotch, that potent mix of sweat, cum and teenage
hormones. Jamie's foreskin was still partly pulled back, and a fresh drop
of precum was already leaking out. With the tip of my tongue, I licked it
off. I swirled my tongue around the head, working it under the foreskin,
before wrapping my lips around the head. Jamie started to moan when I took
his entire dick in my mouth, burying my nose in his ginger pubes. He moaned
even more when I scooped up some of the leftovers from his last orgasm and
rubbed them around his hole. He was tight, but with his own natural lube it
didn't take much pressure to push the tip of my finger inside him. As I
continued to push, more precum oozed out of Jamie's dick.

Suddenly Jamie leaned forward, putting his hands on my shoulders. His knees
buckled, his dick spasmed and more of his sweet cum filled my mouth. I
swallowed it all, gently rubbing his prostate to milk every last drop out
of him. Only when I felt his dick softening did I release it and slowly
pulled my finger out of his butt.

Jamie had a glazed look in his eyes, like he had just awoken from a
wonderful dream. I knew exactly how he felt. He wrapped his arms around me
and we hugged in silence for a while.

""You are such a sweet boy!"" I whispered into his ear. ""And I'm not just
talking about your taste. But now you should really get cleaned up. I'll
see you back in our seats in a few.""

I turned to leave, but Jamie held on to me. ""Oh no, you won't!"" he said and
turned around, showing me his small but firm butt. ""Not before I've felt
you inside me!""

""Are you sure about that?"" I asked. I couldn't resist grabbing both cheeks
and gently kneading them.

""Yes I am!"" he replied. ""It's been a day of first times for me, and I want
you to be the first to fuck me too. Please?""

How could I resist that puppy dog look? Jamie turned around again and undid
my jeans, pulling them down along with my underwear. My rock hard dick
jumped out and almost hit him on the nose. He took it in his hand, pulled
the foreskin back and wrapped his lips around the head. It may have been
his first time, but it was enough to almost make me cum right away. I let
him continue for a bit before pulling out. He grinned and stood up, bending
over with his arms on the counter. We locked eyes in the small mirror above
the sink and he gave me a nod.

Not having planned for anything like this to happen, I didn't have any lube
on me, but there was a liquid soap dispenser. I squirted some of it on my
hand and used it on my dick and on Jamie's hole. One finger went in easily
again, and I soon added a second one to open him up a bit. I wish I could
have spent some time to give him a good rim job, but we couldn't spend all
night in the bathroom together. When I thought that he was ready, I grabbed
my boner and rubbed it up and down his crack a few times. Then I positioned
the head on his tight pink hole and started to apply pressure. Jamie pushed
back against me, opening himself up and making it easier to enter him.

The head went in and I stopped moving to let him get used to it, but
apparently Jamie didn't want to take it slow anymore. He reached back and
grabbed my hips, pulling me in and impaling himself on my boner. I took the
hint and shoved it the rest of the way in. In the mirror I saw that Jamie
was still smiling, though of course there was a little bit of discomfort on
his face too. Reaching around him, I put my hands on his chest, playing
with his nipples, while I was slowly fucking him. He grabbed his own dick,
which was still hard, and started to wank furiously again.

Watching Jamie in the mirror, even such a small one, while I was fucking
him was really turning me on. I picked up the pace and it didn't take long
before I felt my orgasm coming on. With a grunt and a final thrust I
exploded inside him, filling his butt with my hot cum. A few seconds later,
another small load of boy cum landed in the stainless steel sink. I
breathed in deeply to catch my breath before pulling my softening dick out.

""Welcome to the Mile High Club."" I said as I was cleaning myself up a
bit. ""That was quite an induction ceremony!""

While Jamie was still getting dressed, I opened the bathroom door a bit and
peered out. I half expected to find a line of people waiting, but luckily
there was nobody there. So I quickly went back to my seat where Jamie
joined me a few minutes later. We didn't talk, we just cuddled together and
drifted off to a light sleep.

Much too soon for my liking, the night was over and we were served a light
breakfast before the plane started its descent. We shared our contact and
social media information, and a short time later we landed in Frankfurt. I
accompanied Jamie through passport control, to the baggage claim and
finally through customs. Then I took him to the meeting point in the
terminal where a shuttle service was waiting to take him to Rammstein.

I used to finish a prompt session, copy the answer, and close the tab. I treated the context window as a scratchpad.

I was wrong. The context window is a vector database of your own thinking.

When you interact with an LLM, it calculates probability relationships between your first prompt and your last. It sees connections between ""Idea A"" and ""Constraint B"" that it never explicitly states in the output. When you close the tab, that data is gone.

I developed an ""Audit"" workflow. Before closing any long session, I run specific prompts that shifts the AI's role from Generator to Analyst. I command it: 

\> *""Analyze the meta-data of this conversation. Find the abandoned threads. Find the unstated connections between my inputs.""*

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/s/srhOosHXPA

I used to finish a prompt session, copy the answer, and close the tab. I treated the context window as a scratchpad.

I was wrong. The context window is a vector database of your own thinking.

When you interact with an LLM, it calculates probability relationships between your first prompt and your last. It sees connections between ""Idea A"" and ""Constraint B"" that it never explicitly states in the output. When you close the tab, that data is gone.

I developed an ""Audit"" workflow. Before closing any long session, I run specific prompts that shifts the AI's role from Generator to Analyst. I command it: 

\> *""Analyze the meta-data of this conversation. Find the abandoned threads. Find the unstated connections between my inputs.""*

**💬 Can Nova-II extend its winning streak after yesterday's 0.21% masterclass?**

**The component (via Fusion-4) targets 2992 (+0.05%) — another flat consolidation call. The challenge: Can it deliver back-to-back sub-0.5% precision, or will Helix-II's bearish 2786 (-6.8%) scenario materialize?**

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1pb2rsd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb2rsd,MRI and my journey with a herniated disc,"So, I've had back pain for years and had it dismissed by others, and doctors. Apparently it was just a strained muscle.

Over the past couple of weeks the pain has really flared up and I've experienced pain while sitting, sciatica, numbness in my left leg, and reduced movement. It comes in waves where some days are worse than others. I went and saw a different doctor and requested an MRI.

The pain isn't as bad as some other medical issues I've experienced before (endometriosis, wisdom tooth infection, exposed nerve in tooth), but this condition has impacted my ability to play sport, do chores and lift heavy objects. The biggest hit as been my pride, and I am constantly feeling useless. I'm worried I won't be able to ever improve at volleyball. 

I got an MRI, and although I'm yet to receive official results, there wasn't much I could do but laugh... 
(It's looking like a herniated disk).

Things I found helpful: 
- Using this Reddit forum hearing lived experiences
- Stretches every hour or so (look up McGill 3)
- Sleeping on my back, or resting in this position when the pain got bad
- Walking
- Trying to get out and do things like shopping or going to the library 
- Using humour to cope 
- Playing light sports for half an hour a day (e.g. casual volley ball 6 a team, one game).
- Getting MRI scans
- THC brownies 
- Finding a good doctor who knows what they are doing
- Talking to friends to let them know I might be absent sometimes. 
- Educating myself on chronic pain -- I'm a lecturer in Health Psychology and the topics on the gateway theory of pain, and CBT around pain were really interesting. 
- Listening to my body give me feedback. If I'm starting to really hurt after doing an activity it suggests stopping.
- My sweet little cats ❤️ 
- It's difficult, but trying to look forward to something. Whether it's in the distant future or making yourself a nice tea or coffee

Things that weren't helpful:
- Straneous and continuous exercise 
- Sitting on my ass constantly
- Having medical health professionals that didn't understand or emphasize with the issue
- Ruminatin or catastrophizing - it does directly make the pain worse 
- Not being engaged in some activity (like reading, gaming, movies) - distraction is key
- Resting or standing for too long

At the moment, I'm optimistic but sometimes I do spiral. This condition sucks, but evidence suggests it will get better and I won't always be like this.

From day to day

Morning til night

Sunrise to sundown

My thoughts are of you

Picturing your soft smile

Replaying your contagious laugh inside my head

Rereading every kind loving word you've written

Watching old video visits just to see your face again

My love for you runs deep

From your ambitious ways

To your brilliant mind

From the clever jokes 

To your magnificent artistic ability 

With a witty mind, soft tone of voice, and that strong handsome appearance 

It was inevitable, I'd fall head over heels for you

From that first conversation 

Where time seemed to cease and have no value

The feeling of safety and familiarity

Coming from each moment spent in your presence 

As every second we had together felt like we'd known each other forever 

My love for you runs deep

Like the calm of a flowing stream

Or the soft whisper of a midnight breeze

The warmth of the morning sun peeking over head

Or the heat of a momma rabbit nestled in with her babies

You bring light, peace, and comfort to my life

I feel protected, important, loved, and cherished by you

You encourage, guide, and support every part of my life

My love for you runs deep

When I close my eyes its your face I see

The voice I hear within my mind is yours 

My smile is always because of your smile and laughter 

Every decision I make my thoughts think of what you'd say or do first

No matter the time, place, or people

My thoughts never drift away from you 

My love for you runs deep

Awaiting the day to your freedom

To wake up to sun rises together 

To sit and watch the sun set together 

Morning coffee

Goodbye kisses before work

Nightly family dinners 

Strolls hand in hand

Movies and cuddles

Exploring the world as a team

From wedding bells and chapel sounds

To rocking chairs and gray hair

Simplicity of living in freedom together 

My Love for you runs deep

I’m clean, respectful, and pretty easy to live with. I travel a lot for work and personal reasons, so I’m not home year round. I love cooking, staying active, trying new restaurants, and exploring the city. My ideal apartment would be a 2bed 2 bath(I prefer having my own bathroom) in Brooklyn. I have a couple places I’m looking at already.  

What I’m looking for:
• Budget: up to $1,600 for my portion of rent 
• Move-in: asap but flexible
• Preferably Bedstuy but if not open to other parts of Brooklyn (Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Williamsburg), Manhattan or Queens if it’s a good fit
• Female roommates only
• Someone who is clean, kind, and communicative. Must have steady income

What I’m like as a roommate:
• I keep shared spaces clean
• Considerate with noise
• Don’t bring the party home, but love having friends over occasionally
• Travel often, so you’ll get the place to yourself a good amount
• Very drama-free and value open, respectful communication

1pb2nn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIgeneratedessays/comments/1pb2nn1/ai_or_not/,AI or not?,"Is this essay AI? Give your reasoning:  
Since you’ve left the choice to me, I’m going to tackle a subject that feels particularly pressing right now—something that affects how we think, create, and even how we breathe. It’s about the quiet moments we’ve lost.

Here is a reflective essay on **The Lost Art of Boredom.**



# The buzzing in our pockets



**Why we need to stop filling every silence with noise**

I was standing in line at the grocery store yesterday, watching the person in front of me. It wasn’t a long line—maybe two or three minutes of waiting—but the moment the conveyor belt stopped moving, his hand twitched. It was an automatic, almost primal reflex. His hand shot to his back pocket, retrieved a glowing rectangle, and his thumb began the rhythmic, hypnotic slide. Scroll. Scroll. Scroll.

I judged him for a split second before I realized my own hand was hovering over my own pocket, itching for the exact same dopamine hit.

It’s a strange predicament we’ve found ourselves in. We have effectively eradicated boredom from the human experience, and we seem to be patting ourselves on the back for it. But I can't help but feel that in our quest to kill boredom, we’ve accidentally killed something else: the space where our best thoughts used to live.

There was a time, not actually that long ago, when waiting was just… waiting. You sat in a doctor's office and stared at a generic landscape painting until you noticed the brushstrokes were crooked. You rode the bus and watched raindrops race each other down the glass. Those moments were dull, yes. Sometimes they were agonizingly slow. But they were also the moments when your brain went off-leash.

Neuroscientists have a fancy term for this: the ""default mode network."" It’s the state your brain enters when it’s not focused on a specific task. It’s not ""off""; it’s actually hyper-active, connecting disparate ideas, processing emotions, and consolidating memories. It’s why your best ideas happen in the shower or while driving on a long, empty highway. You aren't consuming; you are incubating.

But look at us now. We treat empty time like a disease that needs immediate treatment.

The data backs up this anxiety. Recent reports suggest the average American adult spends somewhere north of four hours a day on mobile internet activities. That isn't just time spent working; that’s time spent filling the gaps. We fill the elevator ride, the commercial break, the thirty seconds it takes for the microwave to reheat coffee. We are terrified of being alone with our own thoughts. And honestly? I get it. Thoughts can be uncomfortable. It’s much easier to watch a stranger renovate a van or argue about politics than it is to sit with the nagging feeling that you should call your mother or that you aren't quite happy in your job.

The tragedy is that by drowning out the quiet, we’re losing our creativity. Creativity isn't a faucet you turn on; it’s a plant that grows in the soil of boredom. If you never let the soil settle, if you’re constantly churning it up with new information, new notifications, and new noise, nothing deep can take root. We are becoming a society of excellent consumers and terrible thinkers.

So, here is my modest proposal, as difficult as it is for me to follow myself: Let yourself be bored.

Next time you are waiting for a friend who is running late, keep your phone in your pocket. Look at the people around you. Notice the way the light hits the pavement. Let your mind wander to that weird thing you said five years ago, then let it drift to what you want for dinner, and then let it drift to an idea you didn’t know you had.

It will feel uncomfortable at first. You will feel that phantom buzz against your thigh. You might feel a little exposed, just standing there doing nothing. But push through the itch. Reclaim the idle moment.

The world is loud enough as it is; you don't need to carry the noise around in your pocket. Give your brain a break. You might be surprised by what it has to say when you finally stop interrupting it.",1,1764561288.0,AIgeneratedessays,0,1.0,False

TL|DR how do I avoid having problems with a former boss's non-solicitation and non-compete when I leave my company to go work for her again.

Let's call my company ""ACME"", my boss ""Amy"" and the company I'm interviewing with ""Bonsai"". 

Amy was a VP of Coyote Affairs who left ACME in May to work for Bonsai, similar role, different industry (trees as opposed to dynamite tee hee hee). ACME is very paranoid and had Amy sign several restrictive covenants, including a 12-month non-solicitation. I used to work with Amy, reported directly to her for more than one year, saw an opening with ACME two weeks ago and had coffee with her to ask about the position. She was clear to say ""I'm only here because you asked."" and ""you reached out first, and I'm happy to tell you about the company."" I did not put her down as a reference but she did mention my name to the hiring manager. 

The interviews have gone very well with Isidor, who told me at the end of the last call that because of a reorg, the position would report to Amy again. Based on what I know about Bonsai, the position, and the compensation, I'd take the offer if it were given to me. 

Are there enough problems that I should waive off, or can I keep from this being a problem?  
I haven't signed a non-compete or any other agreement with ACME about working at Bonsai.  
The single thing I dread most is if my current boss, Wiley, simply asks ""Are you going to work at Bonsai or with Amy?"" because I'd have to lie or dodge the topic altogether with something vague like ""I am choosing not to say more other than I am seeking a role that is not with a direct competitor."" because ACME is litigious like a crooked used mobile home dealer.",1,1764561171.0,legaladvice,3,1.0,False

1pb2l1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1pb2l1z/grateful_for_portland/,Grateful for Portland,"I’m not a religious or spiritual person, not nationalistic or a patriot. But as I reflected on gratitude and Thanksgiving this year, having received videos and pictures from people celebrating around the city, holding Friendsgivings and family gatherings with loved ones and pets, doing raffles with funny prizes and pie contests, hot ones themed turkey dip spreads, unconventional homemade Italian and/or Chinese takeout meals, hilarious board games and delicious whiskey flights, even just playing video games and reading solo or solo quilting and knitting-basically just doing adorable things and being cute people-I wanted to take a second to express gratitude for the people of Portland and the city itself. 

I think I’ve always been grateful to live in the PNW, but my sense of gratitude has grown exponentially these past few months. Portland has become an example of peaceful protest and satirical resistance this year, on a global stage, from inflatable costume sharing, resistance music, roller skating, Peace Tangos, flowers, naked bike rides, marches, impromptu dance parties, and even raising almost $350k by a single coffee shop so people losing SNAP benefits could eat. On top of being one of the most beautiful places to live, where there’s endless outdoor activities and dogs everywhere, good beer, cocktails, coffee, and endless amazing cuisine, I just wanted to point out that people here are some of the kindest and most well-intentioned and accepting people I’ve ever known. People care here, about everything from social justice to the environment, in a way that I don’t feel is performative. Based also on just a few posts I’ve seen here the past few months, people from Portland have hurried out to the coast to try to help beached whales, helped find lost people, pets, wallets, passports, and IDs, helped with pet adoptions and donations to animal related nonprofits and for spay/neuter services, given and organized food relief and aid during governmental shutdowns (and NOT during shutdowns, too), have reached out for new friends and volunteered to go to dinner with someone who couldn’t cancel their expensive dinner reservation. People here generally just always try to help others and be kind, and are always quick with a kind word or restaurant/bar recommendation. I recently had a mental health crash out and would not have been able to navigate it without kind people of Portland sharing advice on Reddit for finding a new PCP (there’s a shortage!) and offering advice on walk-in urgent mental health clinics and on how to file for temporary leave. 

For a few additional personal examples of in-person interactions, my best friend brought her 11 year old daughter to her first concert to see Neko Case with us recently. I was worried I’d have to bark at people who stood in front of her, but everyone was cognizant and polite, and made sure she could see. One lady hopped in front of her on accident and began dancing, but then when she noticed there was a kid behind her, hopped quickly to the side and kept dancing without missing a beat. My friend’s daughter was given merch by a stranger, and as we were leaving, another concert goer stopped to tell her that Neko was just one of many examples that girls were smart and talented and capable of doing anything and that they were so glad my friend’s daughter was there. 

At Record Store Day this weekend, everyone was so polite and smiley and kind despite the store being packed, and it made for a really pleasant experience. (And so did the free mimosas!) I was also able to get a rare double vinyl of Nick Drake covers I’d been coveting and could only find online in Europe. And after our Record Store Day outing, my friend and I decided to try Heretic, the volunteer-based coffee company that had raised so much money for SNAP benefit recipients, and when I told the barista I liked her earrings, she smiled and shook them around in a supremely charming way and told me they were clay and where she got them- an art fair, of course. 

Also, once, on a first date, I made my way into a dog-friendly brewery and a sweet and pretty girl gave me a much needed ego boost by complimenting my dress, and when I accidentally fell because I had been nervously drinking and my Mary Jane loafers were heeled and I struggled walking in them, a homeless person saw and hurried to his tent to get me a first aid kit. When I confessed how embarrassed I was, he complimented me to make me feel better. 

Portland drivers are almost TOO courteous, too. Sometimes to their detriment they let me in every day when they notice I need to turn in on my way to work. Once, at a busy intersection in Portland, a car broke down. Our car and two other cars put on hazards and emptied quickly to help push. Out of nowhere, a dude who appeared to be a fitness instructor with a headset appeared speedwalking toward us. He then led us to push together and directed us verbally while the driver put it in neutral and gave us a thumbs up from the front seat the entire time. After we’d pushed the car to safety, he had us high five then quickly hurried away. It was hilarious and about as weird as you’d expect in Portland. Another time, my friend’s oversized vehicle broke down in the middle of an intersection in a busy SE neighborhood, and neighbors quickly came out to chat and help diagnose. A super cool off-duty mechanic who looked like a mustachioed John Candy told my friend what to get at the nearby Autozone, and even helped with the fix. 

While I want to acknowledge that Portland is definitely not without its problems, I don’t think I’d ever want to live anywhere else. I’ve been lucky to live here for a while now and have never felt appreciation for it like I have as of late. Maybe it’s cringe to post this, but I haven’t always known kindness and I feel it in a big way lately.  

Here’s to many more silent summer reading parties, block parties, art walks, first and last Thursdays, night and weekend markets, themed and planned bike rides, comedy in the park, picnics, free libraries and mug cubbies, derbies, goat petting, beer festivals, cocktail slushie weeks, concerts, stand up, drag shows, parades, blues festivals, food carts, crawls, hot springs, hikes, expensive sandwiches, dog parks, skateboard lanes, cherry blossoms, beer runs, marathons, rose garden visits…you get the idea. 

Thank you for being kind, Portland, and for caring about doing the right thing.

That looked like giant pieces of raw thyroid rather than turkey meat. What the hell?? Most food is underseasoned and or canned/prepared. Lots of people go to grocery stores or places like honey baked ham to get premade food which is made with junk. Say if you buy mashed potatoes out it’ll likely be made with a mixture of butter and margarine. It’s so simple to make. It just takes time and no one works together as a family anymore so we get  instant-pot level food normalized. There used to be a man infomercial in the nineties called “Dump Meals.” She would just dump all these ingredients together, heat it, and call it a meal/food. People really should be ashamed to call this crap American food. 

Fried turkey? Not sure if that is an improvement, but it is a lot of oil and equipment for one meal. People also burn a ton of homes down or burn themselves with this over the top way of cooking a large bird. To be honest, turkey is generally gross anyway. Maybe there is room for improvement in how they’re bread. They’re gross to see cook and the carcass is gross. People who love to eat the legs generally love all the slimey sinews and shit. Ugh I’m going to barf just typing this. 

Then desert is apple pie (boring as fuck), pumpkin pie (again and too much like everything else), and if you’re lucky enough pecan pie. Turns out there is a custard pecan pie for before the standard gelatinous corn syrup one we have. Pecan pie is good, but even that gets old. We should see more of the bourbon pecan pie as gratuitous as it is it goes together well. It should be served as a course along with coffee rather than chaotically left out in the kitchen for everyone to graze over like they’re at a country Baptist potluck dinner. 

Nota bene: we could add in some buffalo or quail since those are American meats though not present at the original Thanksgiving. Succotash would be appropriate too since the native Americans at a lot of it. Also bacon doesn’t need to be the go to for adding something to the meal. ",5,1764560689.0,complaints,13,1.0,False

These could be dates or just activities. I feel like they fit the theme of anti consumption/no excess spending. 

1985: you pretend it’s 1985. This means you are 9 years old (the age my partner was in 1985). No phones (they didn’t exist). No car (you are 9 and can’t drive). Your mom has kicked you out of the house to come back when the street lights come on. No debit cards. If you buy something it has to be a similar price point to what it was in 1985 (this is fun). It involves a lot of walking. You normally only end up getting a coffee/ice tea. Maybe find a flea market or tag sale. 

Money bags: this is a long game that takes place within a whole calendar year. You see how much money you can find. You can’t earn it (no working). You can’t ask for it (no panhandling or gifting). You can’t steal it. It has to be money that you find on the ground. Currently I have $17.62 and he has $218.31 (lucky asshole found $210 on the side of the road one day hahah).

I am posting today to try and learn what “focusing on yourself” means in the context of dealing with an alcoholic (particularly a spouse).

I’ve been reading a lot and listening to podcasts aimed at individuals with alcoholic spouses (I really like the podcast Love Over Addiction). I’m learning a lot about what codependency looks like and how to break out of that role. The phrase that keeps repeating is to “focus on yourself.”

And I get it — I am not supposed to be a caretaker, monitoring every move. I have to accept my husband’s recovery is his own choice and, in doing that, “focus on myself.”

BUT what does that actually mean in practice? Are we still eating meals together? Watching TV at night together? Do I need to tell him when I’m going out to the store or for coffee like I usually would? I am having a hard time being “normal” but doing things completely solo while we’re still living together is painful in its own way — I feel like I’m missing something.

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

It’s been a solid 30 years of drinking—not every day, but honestly, it sure felt like it. Some nights it was just one or two, maybe more on the weekends, maybe less to start the new year.
The issue is that I’ve always considered myself pretty athletic, and it eventually reached a point where alcohol had no business being part of my lifestyle. It’s now been 120 days since I stopped. I didn’t really have a plan to quit, and I never felt like I had a “problem.” Nobody ever said otherwise.
Here’s what’s changed—and what hasn’t.
What’s changed:
When I need to work out, there’s no excuse anymore; I can push that extra mile or rep. I don’t wake up feeling like I need to immediately slam coffee and ibuprofen. My digestion is normal. My skin looks healthier, and I’ve actually lost some weight (though weight was never an issue). Overall, I feel healthier.
What hasn’t changed:
I’m not any happier, and I still go through phases of anxiety. I might actually be more on edge at the end of the day with things like parenting, chores, adult responsibilities, wondering what I missed at work, etc. I don’t sleep any more or any less. I have zero interest in drinking again, but I feel like my personality is a little messed up. Do things start to balance out? I feel like I need to rebuild my sense of humor and attitude.

1pb269v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1pb269v/be_still_be_silent_part_one/,"""Be Still, Be Silent"" [Part One]","I woke to the sound of wood breathing.

Not creaking—breathing.

A slow inhale under my ribs, an exhale that moved through my chest like air passing through an empty room.

For a second, I stayed still, eyes closed, hoping it was a dream.

Then the pain arrived.

Not sharp. Not sudden. Just a dull, steady pressure behind my sternum, pulsing in time with my heartbeat.

I blinked awake.

Morning light poured through the blinds in thin, chalky stripes. Dust drifted in the beams like ash. My apartment was quiet—the kind of quiet that made my ears ring.

I reached down, half-asleep, and my fingers brushed something rough.

A splinter.

No—several.

A whole cluster of tiny wooden slivers pushed beneath my skin, as if someone had tried to stitch old lumber into my ribs during the night. I jerked instinctively, and a few worked their way out with a soft, wet sound.

My breath caught as I stared at my fingertips, watching the blood bead.

I should've panicked.

Anyone else would have.

Instead, I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for the feeling to rise. It didn't. What came instead was the smaller, more obedient emotion I had learned as a child:

*Be still.*

*Be silent.*

*Don't make trouble.*

I murmured those old commandments to myself without meaning to as I sat up.

When I pulled the sheet back, I found more splinters sprinkled across the mattress. Pale. Sharp. Old. They smelled like varnish and mildew and something else I recognized immediately:

Church pews.

The ones I used to crawl under when the sermons got too loud. When I needed the dark to swallow me whole. The ones from St. Marrow's—the church they closed down nearly twenty years ago.

A chill slid down my spine.

""No,"" I muttered, shaking my head. ""No, no. This is a nightmare. That's all.""

But my knees throbbed. Hard.

I swung my legs over the bed and looked down.

Deep bruises stained the center of each knee—purple-black and perfectly shaped. Not from a fall. Not from bumping into something.

From kneeling in desperate, begging prayer.

For a long, long time.

A laugh crawled out of my throat. It didn't sound like me.

""Alright,"" I said to the empty room. ""That's… new.""

My phone chimed from the nightstand—a news alert.

I picked it up and froze.

Her name.

My old Sunday school teacher.

The article was brief. A fall, they said. Then, buried in the last paragraph: *Injuries consistent with ritualistic practices. The victim had ties to St. Marrow's Church, shut down in 2006 following allegations of abuse...*

My stomach lurched, and the phone slipped from my hand, clattering to the floor.

Something moved inside me—not physically, but deeper. Like a shadow turning over. Like a memory waking up and stretching its limbs.

Bile rose to my throat, and before I knew what was happening, I doubled over the toilet, retching. For a moment, the room tilted. My nostrils and throat burned as the room seemed to start fading from me.

The morning light flickered as if something passed in front of it—something small, something familiar. I smelled dust and old hymn books, wood rubbed smooth by decades of kneeling children.

And then—

A breath brushed the back of my neck.

A prayer I hadn't heard in twenty years.

My own breath caught. ""Hello?""

No response.

Just that smell—that awful, nostalgic smell of varnish and hymnals.

I pressed my palm to my ribs. The splinters there pulsed once, as if responding.

It felt as though something in me was waking up, something that had lain dormant for almost two decades.

Something I'd long since buried under those pews, hidden from.

And it was coming back through that old wood.





I was shaking now, and with unsteady hands I wiped my mouth and forced myself upright. My legs were just as shaky, barely keeping me up. The bruises on my knees pulsed like fresh wounds, even though the skin wasn't broken. They looked… earned. As if someone—or something—had guided my body into that posture until it obeyed.

It was like I'd never left that dreadful place at all.

My mind wandered back to the article, to Ms.—

*No.* I won't go there. I've tried not to think about that woman or that place since I put it all behind me. I'm not religious anymore. I don't believe in God. I don't take commands from anyone claiming to speak for Him—not through guilt, not through fear, not while preying on the vulnerable.

No.

I was a child then. I was a victim then.

Today I am a woman who knows better.

I pulled myself to my feet and stumbled to the bathroom. The tile was cold enough on my bare feet to jolt a shiver out of me. When I flipped on the light, the harsh brightness carved out the shadows under my eyes. My reflection looked pale, hollowed, as if the night had taken a piece of my soul while I slept.

I lifted my shirt.

More splinters. Smaller, barely visible unless the light caught them. Embedded along the curve of my ribs like a row of wooden thorns, trying to push through.

""Jesus,"" I breathed. ""What the hell?""

The reflection mouthed the words with me, but a beat behind—like it was learning the shape of them. My pulse quickened. I stared at my own face, waiting for it to happen again, but my reflection synced back up, obedient once more.

I leaned closer. My breath fogged the mirror. I could smell the church again—dust, cracked leather Bibles, the sweet mold that lived in hymnals that had sat damp too many summers.

I blinked, and for half a second, I swore I saw something behind my shoulder in the mirror.

A small shape.

A girl-sized shadow.

Head bowed.

Hands clasped.

Like a child caught praying too hard.

My breath stuttered in my throat.

""Stop,"" I said to the empty room. ""You're hallucinating. You just—you're stressed. That's it. This is just stress.""

But stress didn't leave relics of an abandoned, boarded-up, and forgotten church in my bed.

I turned the sink on and splashed cold water on my face. It steadied me for all of three seconds before the smell of wet wood filled the bathroom. Not the clean smell of lumber—this was older, darker. The pews again. The ones with splinters the size of needles. The ones that left tiny cuts on my palms when I crawled under them.

My ribs squeezed.

""No,"" I said again, louder this time. ""You're here. You're in your apartment. You're—""

A knock.

Soft.

Three taps.

Against the bathroom door.

My blood iced.

The apartment was empty.

I lived alone.

The knock came again—light, hesitant. The way a child knocks when she's afraid of waking someone.

My voice barely scraped out. ""Who's there?""

Silence.

Then, through the door, I heard it:

A small breath.

Shaking.

Familiar.

I reached for the doorknob with an unsteady hand. My heart thudded against the splinters in my ribs, each beat sending another pulse of dull pain radiating outward.

The metal knob felt cold against my palm.

I twisted it.

The door swung open.

Nothing was there.

But the hallway air was colder, as if something had passed through it. And the floor just outside the bathroom held a faint trail of dust—like the kind that collected under the old pews.

It led deeper into the apartment. Away from the front door.

Toward the living room.

As if something small had walked in while I wasn't looking.

And all at once, I wasn't convinced I had woken up alone.





I stepped cautiously down the hallway, every breath thin and shaky. The trail of dust—fine, gray, unmistakably old—led from the bathroom toward the living room like footprints too small to belong to me and too deliberate to be an accident.

I followed it.

Each step I took seemed to make the air colder, as though the temperature dropped a degree every few feet. By the time I reached the living room doorway, I could see my breath.

That was impossible.

My apartment never got this cold, not even in winter.

I stopped.

The dust trail ended at my coffee table.

And sitting neatly in the center of it—placed carefully, precisely—was a book.

A small, battered paperback with a cracked spine and peeling corners.

Its red cover had darkened to a rusty brown with age.

I recognized it instantly, and my heart sank.

*The St. Marrow's Children's Hymnal.*

My hands went numb. This couldn't be real.

""I threw this away,"" I said aloud.

No—I didn't just throw it away. I had stood behind the church the week they shut it down, watching as they boarded up the windows and barred the doors, making sure no one ever set foot inside that old sanctuary again.

I had held this exact hymnal, flipping through it with shaking hands, then hurled it into the old stone well behind the parish hall.

I watched it fade into the black abyss. I heard it hit the bottom with a wet slap against water twenty feet down.

""How…?"" My voice cracked.

I stepped closer. The room felt tight, as if the walls were inhaling. Nostalgia mixed with nausea. The smell of varnish pressed against my sinuses.

*Don't pick it up.*

*Don't touch it.*

*Don't—*

My fingers closed around it anyway. Every instinct screamed to leave it alone.

I lifted it.

Dust bloomed into the air like breath.

The book fell open in my hands on its own, as if something guided it.

Page 34.

The pages should have been pulp after twenty years in that well. Instead, they looked freshly printed, the ink dark and crisp. Only the edges were damp, as if the book had been retrieved moments ago instead of decades.

The children's prayer we all had to memorize, the one they made us say before the ""obedience lessons.""

*Be still.*

*Be silent.*

*Be empty for Him.*

My heart lurched.

Something clenched behind my sternum.

I snapped the book shut—but a piece of paper fell from between the pages and drifted to the floor.

I stared at it for a long time before I could bring myself to pick it up.

It was a folded attendance sticker.

The kind they used to hand out to children for showing up to services.

A white lamb in the corner.

A smiling sun.

And my name.

Written in blocky, childish handwriting:

GEMMA — PEW 3

My knees went weak. For a moment, I couldn't breathe.

Pew 3.

The one I always hid under when I thought no one would notice.

I pressed a shaking hand to my mouth. ""No,"" I said. ""This isn't real. This can't—""

A sound cut me off.

Not loud.

Not harsh.

Just a rhythmic tapping coming from deeper inside the apartment.

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

Like someone… or something… gently knocking.

Not at the front door.

Not at the windows.

Inside.

Somewhere down the hall.

My pulse hammered.

I turned my head slowly, terrified to look, more terrified not to.

And down the dim hallway, just at the bend where my bedroom waited, I saw it:

A small, dusty handprint on the wall.

The size of a child's.

And next to it, written faintly in what looked like smeared dust:

BE STILL

I dropped the hymnal.

The air left my lungs.

Something was here with me.

Something that knew my name.

Something that remembered St. Marrow's.

Something that walked through my apartment while I slept.





The handprint.

The message.

The cold.

I needed to call my therapist. Something wasn't right. Had I been taking my meds? I was pretty sure I'd been regular about it, but maybe I'd missed doses without noticing. The stress, the news about her—perhaps it triggered a dissociative episode.

My crisis plan. I should follow my crisis plan.

Ground yourself. Five things you can see. Four things you can touch. Three things you can hear. Come on, you can do this.

But my hands were shaking too hard to count.

Maybe I needed to be hospitalized again. Maybe I needed someone with me. It wasn't safe for me to be alone, especially when I started thinking about that part of my past.

I tried to back away, but the hallway stretched strangely, like distance was something elastic and unreliable. My heartbeat thudded against the splinters in my ribs, each pulse a dull ache that made the world shimmer at the edges.

And then—

Without warning—

Everything snapped dark.

Not gently.

Not like fainting.

More like someone grabbed a chain inside my skull and yanked, pulling me down into a well with no bottom.

No falling.

No sound.

Just absence.

A command carved into the silence:

*Be still.*





When I surfaced, it was to the sound of my own voice.

Murmuring.

No—praying.

""…empty me… empty me… empty me…""

My eyes flew open.

I was kneeling on the floor beside my bed.

Hard.

Too hard. My knees felt like they would split open at the bone.

My hands were clasped so tightly my knuckles had gone bloodless white, fingers rigid with effort. Each prayer forced itself between my clenched teeth with a rhythm I didn't recognize as my own.

""…make me hollow… make me worthy…""

I couldn't stop.

Couldn't move my jaw.

The words poured out on their own, shaped by a tongue that felt numb and foreign.

My body wasn't mine.

A sharp sting shot through my palms. For a second, I couldn't understand it—until I looked down.

Splinters.

Dozens of them.

Wood driven between my fingers, pushed deep enough that blood slicked the cracks between my knuckles. My hands were clasped around a chunk of wood.

No—a carved wooden edge.

A pew fragment.

The decorative pattern burned itself into my memory even before I entirely took it in. I had pressed my face against this exact wood as a child, repeating prayers I didn't understand, waiting for the pastor's hand to fall on my shoulder.

But this piece—it hadn't been in my apartment before. I would have seen it. Would have remembered.

It had appeared in my hands as if summoned.

My stomach turned.

""I—"" I tried to speak, to break the prayer, but the word caught in my throat like a hook.

My head jerked downward sharply, violently, as if something shoved it. My forehead hit the pew fragment with a hollow thud.

And my mouth continued.

""…be silent… be still… be emptied for Him…""

Tears blurred my vision.

I tried to rip my hands apart, but they wouldn't budge. The clasp was too tight, too deliberate. My fingers ached, but the pressure only increased, as if someone—some*thing*—was forcing me to hold on.

Then my body shifted.

My spine bent backward in a rigid arch, my knees grinding into the floor. A deep, guttural sound rose from my chest—half sob, half resistance—before the prayer thrust itself louder, faster, frantic.

I could feel it.

Something was crawling upward through me.

A presence with small hands and a familiar fear.

A child's terror.

A child's obedience.

A child's voice using my lungs.

""…make me clean… make me empty…""

My vision flickered.

Light sputtered.

My ears rang.

""…make me holy…""

Then—just as suddenly as it seized me—it let go.

The prayer cut off mid-word.

My hands fell open.

The pew fragment clattered to the floor—and when I blinked, it was gone, vanished as if it had never been there at all.

I collapsed forward, gasping, cheek pressed to the cold hardwood. Sweat slicked my skin, mixing with blood and the smell of old varnish.

The room was quiet again.

Too quiet.

I pushed myself up on shaking arms, disoriented and nauseous. My knees were bleeding through my pajamas. My palms were filled with splinters. My throat felt raw, scraped from the inside.

Was any of this real? Had I done this to myself during a break? But the splinters—I couldn't have—the hymnal in the well—

And carved into the dust on the floor in front of me—letters shakily formed by my own hands while something else controlled them—were the exact words from the hymnal:

**BE STILL**

**BE SILENT**

**BE EMPTY**

I stared at them, heart hammering.

I hadn't written them.

But my body… something in my body had remembered.

Something inside me was praying.

And it wasn't me.

From somewhere in the apartment—maybe my bedroom, maybe closer—I heard it again.

That soft, familiar breathing.

Wood exhaling.





I didn't sleep.

Couldn't.

I stayed on the floor for a long time, hunched over where the pew fragment had been, breathing in shallow, broken gulps while the words *be still, be silent, be empty* stared up at me from the dust.

At some point, I forced myself to stand.

At some point, I washed the blood from my hands.

At some point, I changed my clothes because they were soaked through with sweat and fear.

But I wasn't really there for any of it.

Every time I looked down at my palms, the splinters seemed to shift beneath the skin, as if settling into place.

As if rooting.

Eventually, I found myself sitting on the couch, gripping my phone like it was the only real thing left in the room. My fingers were unsteady, but I wasn't cold.

No.

I was vibrating with something that felt like static under my ribs.

I opened my news app to distract myself, to prove the world was still ordinary—unchanged by whatever had just crawled up through me.

The moment the page loaded, I froze.

Another headline.

Another name I recognized.

My breath left my body in one sharp exhale.

*""Former St. Marrow's Pastor Found Dead in Apparent Self-Mortification Ritual.""*

My skin went numb.

The article was worse:

*Knees split open. Hands clasped so tightly that bones fractured. Forehead bruised from repeated impact. Foul play suspected. Authorities reopening investigation into Sunday school teacher's death.*

The same posture I had woken in.

The same posture they made us practice during ""obedience.""

For a moment, the screen blurred. I thought I might pass out, but no—my body held me up. Too tense. Too awake. Like something inside me didn't want me to collapse.

I shut the phone off.

Turned it back on.

Reread the headline, hoping it would change.

It didn't.

A cold, thin pressure unfurled around my ribs, too faint to understand but unmistakably there. Small fingers brushing dust from a pew.

""No,"" I said out loud. ""No. No, I didn't—I couldn't—""

My hands shook so violently that I nearly dropped the phone.

I opened my contacts.

Scrolled to Dr. Renner.

My thumb hovered over the call button.

I didn't want to sound crazy.

I didn't want to say anything out loud. Saying it made it real.

But something inside me nudged—gentle and cold—as if encouraging me to stay quiet.

I fought it.

Pressed ""Call.""

The ringing made my heartbeat spike.

""Dr. Renner's office,"" came her calm, professional voice. ""This is Dr. Renner.""

I swallowed, but my throat barely worked. ""It's me,"" I said, my voice thin and shaken. ""I—I need to talk to you. Something's wrong.""

She paused. ""You sound frightened. Are you safe?""

The question made something twist in my chest.

I wasn't sure.

""I—something happened last night. I lost time. I blacked out. And I…"" My voice cracked. ""Dr. Renner, I woke up praying.""

""…Praying?""

""Not like—just praying. I mean…"" I looked down at my bruised knees, at the splinters under my skin. ""Like I wasn't the one doing it.""

A soft inhale on her end.

Not judgment.

Recognition.

""Are you alone right now?"" she asked.

""Yes."" My voice wavered. ""I think so.""

""You think so?""

I closed my eyes. Behind my eyelids, I saw dust, the underside of pews, small hands pressed together in forced obedience—a shadow-shape of myself at seven years old.

""I don't know what's happening to me,"" I said. ""And I'm scared I—""

My breath hitched.

I almost said *I'm scared I killed someone.*

But the words stuck, as if something didn't want me to speak them.

""I'm scared,"" I corrected softly. ""I'm scared of myself.""

There was a long, thoughtful silence.

""Can you come in today?"" she asked gently. ""Right now, if possible.""

I hesitated.

A faint warmth pulsed beneath my ribs—like a heartbeat that wasn't mine.

A child's voice, close enough that I couldn't be sure whether it came from inside or from somewhere behind me, breathed:

*Be still.*

My throat tightened.

""…I don't know,"" I said.

""Try,"" Dr. Renner said. ""Just try to come. We'll figure this out together.""

The line clicked off.

The apartment was silent again.

Except I wasn't.

Something inside me was listening.





I don't remember the drive to Dr. Renner's office.

One moment, I was sitting on my couch, phone still warm in my hand; the next, I was standing in her waiting room, my coat half off, my breath fogging the air like I'd walked through winter.

But it was warm inside.

Too warm.

I don't remember my hands on the wheel. Don't remember my foot on the pedal. Don't remember unlocking my car or locking my apartment door behind me.

But somehow I arrived.

My whole body felt out of sync—like I had skipped frames, like pieces of time had been cut out and taped over.

Dr. Renner stepped into the doorway with her usual calm smile. ""Come in.""

My mouth tried to return the smile, but the muscles didn't cooperate. They pulled strangely, stiffly, as if they were remembering expression instead of feeling it.

I followed her down the short hallway. The floorboards didn't creak, but I could hear them anyway—like echoes from somewhere else. Somewhere older. Wooden. Hollow.

Her office smelled like chamomile tea and paper. Safe smells. Human ones.

I sat on the couch. Dr. Renner took her usual chair across from me and crossed her legs, her expression calm, welcoming.

""What happened last night?"" she asked gently.

I opened my mouth.

Nothing came out.

Just a thin rush of air.

Dr. Renner didn't push. She waited.

The pressure behind my sternum rose. I pressed my palm there instinctively. The splinters under my skin pulsed once in response—almost like they were nodding.

""I… I lost time,"" I finally said.

""How much time?""

""I don't know. Minutes? Hours?"" I shook my head. ""I woke up on the floor. Kneeling.""

Her gaze sharpened slightly. ""Like prayer?""

I nodded.

""Were you praying?""

""I wasn't. My body was."" My voice cracked on the last word.

Dr. Renner didn't flinch. She leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on her knees. ""And when you woke up…?""

""I couldn't stop."" My hands twisted in my lap. ""The words just kept coming—old prayers. The same ones I haven't said since I was a kid. My jaw wouldn't move the way I told it to. My body wasn't listening.""

She nodded slowly. ""Dissociative trance states can feel exactly like that. But tell me—did anything trigger it? Any memory? Any objects? Any stressors?""

I hesitated.

The news headline.

The hymnal.

The pew fragment.

The handprint.

I could see she was studying me now.

""There was…something in my apartment,"" I said quietly.

""What kind of something?""

I swallowed hard. ""A book. From St. Marrow's. One I threw away years ago.""

Her face softened, not in pity but in recognition. ""You went through something traumatic in that church. It would make sense for your mind to bring symbols of that time back into your awareness.""

""It wasn't just that."" I shook my head. ""I—didn't bring it there. I didn't find it in a drawer. It was on my table. Set out, waiting for me.""

She studied me for a long moment.

""And you're sure someone else couldn't have put it there?""

""Who?"" My voice rose, thin and sharp. ""Who even has keys to my apartment? Who would know about that book? About my pew? About where I used to hide?""

Her calm didn't break.

Mine did.

Tears blurred my vision, but I didn't quite cry. The tears stayed suspended, like my face was afraid to commit to the emotion.

""Gemma,"" she said gently. ""You're dissociating. That's not your fault. Trauma fragments. It leaves echoes. Sometimes the mind tries to reclaim lost pieces in ways that feel… alien.""

She paused.

""Do you feel unsafe with yourself?""

The question slid under my skin like a blade.

I hesitated too long.

""I…I don't know,"" I admitted.

Dr. Renner nodded gently. ""Can you tell me what your body was doing when you regained awareness? Anything physical that stood out?""

My mouth opened before I could stop it.

""My hands were bleeding.""

Her eyes flicked to them, still wrapped in bandages. ""From what?""

""Splinters,"" I said. ""A lot of them.""

She inhaled slowly. ""From your floor?""

I shook my head.

""No,"" I said quietly. ""From a pew. A real wooden pew. From St. Marrow's.""

Something flickered across her face then—concern tightening around the edges of her composure.

""Gemma… St. Marrow's has been boarded up for years. No one has set foot inside that building in over a decade. It would be far too dangerous for anyone to try to enter an abandoned building that old.""

The air felt thinner.

""I know,"" I said.

Silence stretched between us, pulsing and electric.

She leaned forward again, her voice quieter now. ""May I ask something difficult?""

I nodded.

""When you were praying… did it feel like you were the child you used to be?""

A shiver ran through me.

""No,"" I said carefully. ""It felt like… the child I used to be was praying through me.""

Dr. Renner sat back. Her expression shifted—not disbelief, not dismissal, but something more profound. Something like recognition of a possibility she didn't want to acknowledge.

""Gemma… you're describing a type of traumatic fragmentation. A severe one. But the physical elements—the splinters, the book—those don't entirely fit the clinical pattern.""

No. It certainly didn't. Something was bending the pattern. Something old.

Something carved from wood and obedience.

""What if it's not trauma?"" I said. ""What if it's something else?""

Dr. Renner's lips parted slightly. ""What are you afraid it is?""

I stared at my hands.

My palms tingled under the bandages.

The pulsing beneath my ribs grew warm—too warm.

""A return,"" I said quietly. ""Not a memory. Not a fragment. A return.""

Dr. Renner didn't speak.

And then—barely audible—something breathed behind me.

A soft exhale.

Child-sized.

Every muscle in my body locked. My breath stopped.

Dr. Renner's eyes flicked over my shoulder.

They widened.

Just a fraction.

""Gemma,"" she said, her voice suddenly too careful, too measured. ""Don't turn around.""",2,1764559877.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Rita’s fingers tightened around the envelope in her hand as she walked up the steps to Aaron’s house in The Flats, a quiet, upscale neighborhood in Beverly Hills. The sun was dipping low, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns and elegant homes. Her pulse thumped in her ears, but her face was carefully composed, almost serene. A week of restless waiting, a week of wondering if she’d imagined the similarities, had led to this moment. The lab results were in her grasp, clear and undeniable.

It had all started at the gala a week ago. Nicole had brought her along under the guise of spending time together and observing the event, but Rita had found herself drawn to Aaron from across the room. She watched him carefully, noting his gestures, his laugh, the tilt of his head when he spoke. Every small detail, every familiar mannerism, seemed to confirm the suspicions that had been growing inside her for years. To clear any doubt, Rita quietly collected what she needed at the gala. By the time she returned home, her mind was made up: she had to face him.

Rita paused at the front door, brushing a strand of hair from her face and taking a deep breath. The house loomed before her, warm beige walls and a neatly kept garden giving no hint of the storm poised at the doorstep. She could hear her heartbeat in the quiet, steady, insistent.

Then she lifted her hand and pressed the doorbell. The soft chime echoed through the house, and Rita took a careful step back, letting the envelope stay hidden against her side.",9,1764559752.0,AIDungeon,1,1.0,False

1pb23ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1pb23ou/trying_to_make_sense_of_a_car_crash_hoping_for/,"Trying to make sense of a car crash, hoping for some insight from other people who follow Neville.","Neville Goddard's works and his audio lectures helped essentially save me and totally transform my life about 4 years ago when I became very ill. Because my life became so good I didn't consistently continue to apply the practice since there was not much I wanted, or I took enough pleasure in the play of wanting and uncertainty that it didn't feel necessary.

  
Since my illness the only time I have used his practice is when I had an allergic reaction to a migraine medicine in an ER and had the worst panic attack of my life, in which case I used it to try to manifest never feeling that fear again.

  
In some ways this has worked. About 10 days ago I got into a major car wreck and broke many bones and suffered some internal injuries. It was very painful but despite the agony and usual fear of pain I experience I was blessed to not spiral into the depth of panic that I had felt that one night in the ER. So in that way I believe it worked.

  
My concern stems from my constant, low-grade anxiety about terrible disasters. This aspect of my personality has dramatically improved since Neville but it still exists. Rather than fight it or try to focus on it or wrestle with it, I mostly ignore it and just try to visualize how I want to feel. But I have almost involuntary powerful, in-depth imaginations of what it would be like to die or suffer terrible pain: in a car crash, drowning, burning, by a serial killer, etc. These thoughts are less frequent but still there and I don't feel like I can fight them.

  
My life has been so good lately and things going generally so well that my anxiety seemed to spike despite me otherwise feeling happy and calm. I understand this is a paradox. But while I continued to do my practice for small things (passing a school test, etc.) and generally remain loving and appreciative, that anxiety still existed and those intense visualizations slipped in. Hours before my wreck I remember driving to the coffee shop thinking simultaneously, ""I am so blessed by God to have driven so much and never had a car accident"" and also ""It's been a long time since something really bad happened, this must mean something bad will happen.""

  
Then hours later...

  
I am looking for some kind person who has maybe more experience to give me insight into this phenomenon. Did my involuntary rumination attract this disaster? Did the fact I regularly have these powerful, in-depth imagination of extreme pain do something to bring it to be?

  
I am a little untethered and unsure how to feel. I don't question the Law. I know that tonight when I go to bed I will use it again to try to feel how I want: that I am safe, that this crash was somehow a blessing that will reveal itself in time, that everything is in control in a higher order, that I don't need to be afraid.

My dad has no respect for hygiene and has really poor habits that disgust me. 

He’s constantly fiddling with his nose - pulling out hairs, twisting them, picking etc. If it’s not his nose, it’s his ears, and same thing - pulling hairs, twisting, digging for ear wax. He’s always rubbing his feet and his feet stink. One time I saw him clipping his toe nails, scratch his face with the same hands he was using to dig into his toes, and then he blew his nose into the same tissue with his toe clippings. He doesn’t brush his teeth, only occasionally uses mouthwash. He sneezes, sometimes into his hand, and then proceeds to rub it into his face or continue around the kitchen. I’ve seen him blow his nose into the ground (thankfully outside but still in the back yard) like a spit from his nostrils - by blocking one side and giving a big blow - no tissue, and just carry on. 

Besides this, there’s other practises that give me the absolute ick. His diet is horrendous, where to even begin... He doesn’t cook, just boiled potato, egg, bread and garlic. Sometimes instant noodles as a bonus. He doesn’t put this away in the fridge… he leaves it out overnight for days and still eats the same thing off the stove for days, even if I put in the fridge he puts it back out. 6 heaped teaspoons of sugar in instant coffee several times a day. He’s learnt ‘sugar is bad’ after his doctor told him he’s looking diabetic, so now it’s honey or syrup in everything because in his mind that curbs the issue… also cake isn’t sugar because he can’t see the granules. He puts honey and syrup in his potato and egg, alongside his sickly sweet coffee. He doesn’t shower as frequently as he should and often smells. His laundry smells awful even after a wash because he doesn’t use detergent properly. His gut is mess… it’s diarrhoea all the time. Of course it is…

Because of all this, he’s dumb and foggy-brained all the time. He laughs things off or goes away for a sook. It’s reached a point where I can barely see any of his positive qualities anymore. He’s only getting older and I’m disgusted more every day. 

Looking at all this together, I think he just likes being gross… it started as playful ‘eww dad!’ laughing and playing when we were little, to more gentle confrontations, and as we’ve gotten older and the disrespect for hygiene become louder there’s bitter resentment, horror, and ostracism and he just ignores it all as if we’re the problem. He has other infantile behaviour that exacerbates all of this but that’s another can of worms. 

Is anyone able to explain why he’s like this, and whether this is a mental illness, and if so what it is?",1,1764559417.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False
1pb20gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pb20gl/advice_you_dont_need_grindset_culture_you_need/,"[Advice] You don’t need “grindset” culture, you need structure that actually works","Most people aren’t lazy. They’re just drowning in noise, stuck in the loop of “do more, be more” without any real system to make it work. Hustle culture told everyone to wake up at 4 AM and “manifest success” by sheer willpower. But that advice came from influencers who thrive off your burnout. What actually works isn’t doing more, it’s building structure that makes execution automatic.

This post is for anyone who feels like they’re trying everything from productivity hacks, planners, and morning routines, but still feels chaotic inside. The insights here come from cognitive science, peak performance research, and not some viral TikTok guru. These are tools that have helped high-performers stay consistent without the fake motivation pump.

Here’s a breakdown of the structure that actually works:

- **Design friction into your environment.** James Clear in *Atomic Habits* talks about “choice architecture.” Make good activities easier to start and bad ones harder to access. Want to read more? Keep a book near your bed. Want to check your phone less? Delete the social apps or use grayscale mode. Environment always beats willpower.

- **Your brain loves checklist loops.** In the *Huberman Lab Podcast*, Andrew Huberman explains how task completion releases dopamine. Not reward, but progress. That’s why breaking big goals into micro-tasks works. Even a 5-minute win like replying to an overdue email gives your brain a “progress hit” that builds momentum.

- **Stop trusting motivation. Build time blocks instead.** Cal Newport in *Deep Work* emphasizes scheduling your focus the same way you’d book a meeting. Motivation is unreliable, but pre-decided time blocks with clear intentions reduce decision fatigue. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing what matters on time.

- **Use the 80 percent rule.** Productivity psychologist Oliver Burkeman (author of *Four Thousand Weeks*) suggests aiming for 80 percent effort, not 100. Perfectionism paralyzes execution. Show up, ship the work, then iterate. That’s how elite performers stay consistent. 
Not by maxing out, but by sustaining better-than-average output every single day.

- **Stack your habits, don’t chase them.** BJ Fogg from Stanford talks about “habit stacking” in *Tiny Habits.* The idea: pair a new habit with an existing one so it rides the identity wave. Like doing 10 pushups after brushing your teeth, or writing 3 bullet journal notes after making coffee. It makes follow-through frictionless.

- **Don’t start the day with your inbox.** Research from Gloria Mark (*Attention Span*, 2023) shows that reactive work like emails and Slack switches your brain into “task response mode,” not “deep thinking mode.” Starting your day with your priorities and not someone else’s can double productivity without working extra hours.

- **Track energy, not just time.** Daniel Pink’s book *When* explores how energy levels fluctuate throughout the day. Some people peak early, others late. If you’re forcing deep work during your worst mental window, no productivity system will work. Align your most important work with high-energy windows instead of trying to be a morning person just because a YouTuber said so.

- **Make your calendar your second brain.** Productivity coach Tiago Forte recommends using your calendar not just for meetings, but for thinking time, chores, learning, and rest. Treat it like a mirror of who you're becoming. If your calendar doesn’t reflect your goals, don’t expect your life to either.

- **Weekly reviews over daily panic.** David Allen’s *Getting Things Done* method emphasizes doing weekly reviews of all your tasks and goals. It calms your mind and prevents the obsession with “urgent over important.” One hour a week planning saves 10 hours of flailing.

- **The system is the self.** Clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson often says that your daily structure *is* your identity. Systems don’t just help you do stuff, they help you become someone. You don’t rise to the level of your ambitions. You fall to the level of your structure.

Hustle culture thrives on guilt. Real structure thrives on clarity. You don’t need more grinding. You need systems that make discipline feel automatic.",3,1764559411.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

That word has a tremendous amount of weight attached to it, once that word enters your life it is like a cockroach. You can’t get rid of it no matter how you try to erase it, the darkness, fear, and the unknown never truly leaves you. From that moment onward my life had become dedicated to taking care of my dad, my days became school then going to the house to visit my dad then back home and repeat. I had never met a man with such horrific luck in my life, he had gotten every single negative side effect you could’ve  possibly imagined. He had lost his hearing, he had described it has be permanently had earmuffs over his ears. The doctor then recommended he try a different treatment to hopefully counter the ill effects of the hearing loss, the new medication took his taste from him. He would cry at the dinner table barely able to eat, I remember one ill fated dinner he threw the plate against the wall and began to ball his eyes out. “It all tastes like fucking sewage” he shouted as he rushed over to the bathroom to throw up the little food he had eaten. After three days of him not eating he was once again put onto his third treatment. The third one crippled him, he had developed neuropathy. He lost the ability to walk and he could even hold a plate with him dropping it. The neuropathy was the beginning of the end, he became bed ridden. The day he came home all of the energy had shifted and changed into a thick heavy aura the weighed down the entire home. The days started feeling slower and longer, felt like the entire house had been filled with a thick viscous syrup.  He went from being the pilar of the family, a man who coached every sports team, running and screaming on the sidelines to a shriveled man with barely the strength to hold a half filled plastic cup. His stomach had become hard and swollen from the cancerous fluid that began leaking into his abdominal cavity. Draining his stomach over and over having the brown liquid into light bulb looking bottles, after the draining his breathing would finally improve and he would regain just a touch of the life and energy he usually would have. At night that’s when things would become weird, I’d go to the bathroom and he would hear my dad in a sing song voice “I’m dying im dyinggg” to himself in the dark. I still remember one night I woke up to take a leak and I hear muffled talked through my door, once I walk out my door I wanted to check in on him. “Hey dad, you alright” I asked. “yeah buddy, you actually just missed your great grandma.” He said with an almost child like enthusiasm. “Okay?  Where did you see her?” “she was right there in the corner of the living room! You must’ve just missed her.” That night made it hard to go to sleep after that, I would hear him talking or singing or just plain crying. It all came to a head in on the 26th of November, I just remember being so tired. God I was so tired, I had finally lost the battle of going on minimal sleep. I gave in to the soft felt of the couch, on that night it really felt like all the stresses of the world vanished. I was in the living room with him, if he needed me he could a just called me. The next thing I knew I woke up to a voice screaming my dad’s name. “Tony! Tony!” Movies make death look for grandiose, some large spectacle that is full of pageantry. I can tell you that is 100% the furthest thing from the truth.  I another up from my nap to a scene that is now forever burned into the deepest recesses of my brain. He was breathing slow, agonal, he had a wild look in his eyes. One that a you would see on a farm animal in the kill shoot, aimless fear and incomprehensible understanding.  I rushed over to him and tried to put his nasal cannula on his nose, but for some reason I will never know he turned his head from me. I can’t remember  his favorite color or the recipe to his chilli but I can never for the look he gave me when he took his last breath. I slumped onto the floor in defeat, all the plans, all the dreams we shared just gone in the blink of an eye. After the cornor came and took my dad away I just sat on his hospice bed in complete silence. I sat there dumbfounded, my whole world had just crumbled right in front of me. As I thought to myself “how on earth can this get any worse,” she came. It started slow like a sickness it started small, I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye to random bumps and noises. Then one day it kicked up a notch or two, I was showering home alone and from down the hall I could hear foot steps.. slow deliberate, the steps slowly got louder as they got closer then they suddenly stopped at the door. One large bang on the door sent me damn near through the roof “ holy shit! hello” I said in a panick. I’m not sure if you’ve ever been butt naked being put into fight or flight but I flung the shower curtain open and bum rushed the door. I grab that handle and took a quick deep breath, I flung the door open ready to face whatever was behind the door. I look to the right and the left analyzing what coulda made that sound, after a few moments I just assumed I must’ve heard something. Maybe  the lack of sleep and loneliness played some tricks on me. The torment went on for weeks, but it had just been little things, knocks, noises, shadows. Things to just make me question myself did I just hear that? But it slowly ramped up in intensity it then became hearing voices. I would be fillin out a college application “that’s too hard for you.” It wanted to beat me down, make me weak, vulnerable.  I started staying at home more I would ignore friends and family, the more I heard the voices the more of a burden I felt. This thing was stripping me down piece by piece, whisper every insecurity I ever had, every little thing I was ever worried about they confirmed were true. I had been just so weighed down, so mentally and emotionally exhausted, I had decided I wouldn’t go to school one morning. Just lay in the couch and rot, but that thing had another plan. I was watching some king of the hill and trying to relax and charge my mental battery. But then a familiar sound rang through the house, the slow quiet creek of the floor boards. I peered  around the tv and all the air had been sucked from my lungs. Standing down the hall was a sight that had me frozen in terror. It’s hair was black an greasy it covered her face, her skin was pale and thin. So thin you could see the veins, arteries, muscles and joints move and shift underneath it. Her breast hung down to her mid thigh, her nails had to have been 3-4 inches long. The creature said “sweetie are you going to be late for school?” In low almost mocking tone. Before I could fully comprehend the atrocious scene infront of me she lunged at me, her limps moved abnormally bending and twisting and ways that shouldn’t have been possible. She was on top of me almost instantaneously, I could feel her bony hand wrap around my throat. The grip slowly getting tighter and tighter. My airway was almost completely closed off and I was starting to pass out. I noticed out of the corner of my eye I noticed my coffee mug on the living room table. With all my remaining strength I reached out and grabbed the ceramic mug and slammed it against the creatures head. The mug shattered and the beast screeched in pain, with the tiny amount recoil from the monster I was able to shift position and slam the remaining shard into its head. The sharp edge went into the skull with a loud ripping sound as flesh and blood poured out the newly opened wound. At that point she was off balance enough I was able to break grip on my neck. I got up and decided I was done living with the burden of this monstrosity in my life.  For the first time in a long time I was gunna do something for me, I was going to rid myself of this horrid woman. I ran to the hallway closet, I can feel the creatures footsteps behind me. I didn’t have much time, I threw open the door and saw my old childhood baseball bat. I grabbed it and gripped the handle tightly and in one quick motion I flipped my hips and brought the bag down on the pale decrepit head of that thing. It made a loud pop just like when someone he’s that perfect home run, she slumped to the floor. I couldn’t tell if she was moving but I didn’t care, I wish I could tell you what happened next. I just blacked out, I just let bringing the bat down over and over and over again till my arms went numb. My arms were exhausted and I dropped the bat, I just took a step back and just saw a bloody mess of flesh and crimson all over the walls, floor and ceiling. I just packed a duffle bag, got in my car and drove to the air port. I decided to move far away from that house and try and escape just all the horrible things that had happened in that house. I found myself living in Las Vegas, in a nice quiet suburb. I actually did make something of my life I’m a firefighter and have a wife and a dog. I had just gotten home from my twenty four hour shift and just tossed myself on my bed to relax a bit. I was thinking to myself about how happy I was with how my life had been going. Just as I had begun to slowly drifting off for a quick power nap my dog shot up outta bed and started growling at my closest. I thought he was just being dramatic and heard the house settling, but then I heard a familiar knock from inside the closest. The end",1,1764559348.0,ScaryStory,0,0.99,False
1pb1zgz,https://v.redd.it/4ct8jp61ei4g1,The true reason of why the Algerian currency is falling,"I am seeing a lot of very uneducated comments around the fall of the DZD in the black market. No the money isn't falling because someone is 'printing' money like Nekkaz seems to believe [https://x.com/larevueafrique/status/1995124810624483611](https://x.com/larevueafrique/status/1995124810624483611)



The reason, isn't because people are exiting the cash in suitcases either.



The reason is the 2026 Finance Law that provisions subsidies for mega projects in Algeria, and the internal debt is growing to finance these projects. The 2026 budget allocates a colossal 657.65 billion Algerian dinars (approximately €4.5 billion) to commodity subsidies alone. Key allocations include: €331 billion for cereals. €96 billion for milk. €100 billion to stabilize prices for essential goods like sugar, oil, and green coffee. 





Does this make sense? Yeh. Currently all the public spending goes in financing imports, which explains why  meatloaf of bread costs 0.03$ in Algeria vs 2$ in other places. Algeria absolutely needs to re-shore production, and this is not going to happen without growing internal debt. This is the same playbook the BRICS followed in the 2000s. 





The DZD level isn't the most relevant metric because 2026 finance law also increases salaries, and cost of living remains subsidized. The metric is: what is the timeline to open up the economy and unleash the potential? This is what China did with entering WTO in 2001, which ushered in its success.

I work in a medium sized office and we recently got a new coworker who on day one acted like we were long lost friends. She’d bring me coffee, ask about my weekend, tell everyone how “sweet” I was. It felt a bit much but harmless. Then things got weird.



She started stepping into conversations I was having with others and twisting my words in this really subtle way. Like I’d mention being tired and she’d jump in with “yeah she’s been really overwhelmed lately” and people would look at me like I needed help. Then she told our manager that I had asked for lighter tasks because of “stress”. I never said anything like that. When I confronted her she gave me this wide eyed hurt face and said she was just trying to protect me.



Last week it escalated hard. I overheard her telling another coworker that I’d been crying in the bathroom. I hadn’t. I don’t even use that bathroom. She said she was “worried about my stability”. I felt my stomach flip. I asked her straight up why she was saying these things and she leaned in really close, too close, and said “people listen to me here. You should let me handle things for you”. The way she said it made my skin crawl.



Yesterday I found out she went to HR asking if they could check in with me because I “might be unsafe alone”. I don’t know what game she’s playing but I feel like she’s putting me in a corner where anything I say will sound defensive or unstable. My friends say she’s trying to isolate me to look like the hero that saves the fragile coworker. I honestly feel sick thinking about going back tomorrow.

1pb1wgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1pb1wgs/how_much_caffeine_to_drink_on_wellbutrin/,How much caffeine to drink on Wellbutrin?,"So I just recently started taking 150mg Wellbutrin per day a little less than a week ago. I have yet to feel any positive effects from it. The only thing I do notice is that I feel more jittery with my normal amount of caffeine and I get stomach aches if I don't eat on it.

I've actually always had a problem with caffeine. It's significantly worsened my anxiety, but for some reason my OCD leads me to compulsively drink it.

So my normal habit is: 1) wake up and immediately drink 3 cups of tea that are by my bed in a thermos (after I chug like 3 glasses of water for hydration 2) lie in bed for a while 3) go down and have a cup of coffee  4) later I see if I need more caffeine after I've eaten and been up for a while.

But now my routine has been thrown off, so what happens is I wake up and eat an energy bar by my bed and take the Wellbutrin and then drink the tea. Then I won't feel like I can wake up as properly as before cause I'm used to caffeine on an empty stomach but now I'm having food with it. So then I go have that cup of coffee, and yet I just don't feel right. I won't always feel as awake as I'd like, and yet at the same time I'm feeling sort of jittery, possibly irritated at times, and a little headachy.

I guess I should cut down on the caffeine probably. I'm thinking that maybe if I take the Wellbutrin with food like 45-60 minutes before ANY caffeine and wait to see how I feel that then maybe I'll know better how much caffeine I need. Maybe then just drink 1-2 cups of tea rather than 3 and wait to see how that feels.

What do you guys think about that plan and did any of you have trouble figuring out your caffeine dosage when you first started Wellbutrin? What do you guys suggest to figure out how to balance your caffeine intake with the Buproprion?

I'm also just wondering when I'm going to know if this stuff helps with my depression cause so far it hasn't.",3,1764559096.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

1pb1qre,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1pb1qre/ninja_under_the_hood_variability_in_shots_thanks/,Ninja under the hood - variability in shots. Thanks to chatgpt. Made me appreciate delonghi magnifica evo bit more and clarify priorities… may help others…,"Here is the real, engineering-level reason why Ninja uses a variable-flow pump instead of a traditional constant-pressure (9-bar) espresso pump — and why it leads to the tradeoffs you’re noticing.

This will explain exactly why Ninja behaves the way it does, including the inconsistent ratios, water-based dosing, and sensitivity to grind size.

**☕** 

**Why Ninja Uses a Variable-Flow Pump Instead of a Constant 9-Bar Pump**

Below are the actual design motivations, not marketing.

**1. Cost and Mass-Market Design**

A true espresso pump (Ulka EP5, EX5, etc.) costs:

* more money
* more engineering
* more durability testing
* more internal reinforcement from the machine chassis

Ninja designs appliances for:

* $200–$350 price points
* mass retail
* home coffee beginners
* consumers who want simplicity

A full 9-bar pump adds:

* cost
* size
* noise
* weight
* a need for industrial-grade valves and boiler/pump coordination

Ninja avoids all of this by using a variable-flow vibratory pump that imitates some espresso behaviors without achieving true 9-bar stability.

**2. Ninja is designed to handle BOTH coffee and espresso**

Your machine must brew:

* espresso
* Americano
* brewed coffee
* over-ice
* specialty drinks
* lungo
* barista presets

A traditional espresso pump is terrible at making drip coffee:

too high pressure

* too aggressive
* wrong water flow curve
* requires bypass valves



By contrast, Ninja’s pump:

* varies flow
* imitates pre-infusion
* increases/decreases water velocity
* operates like a drip machine AND a pseudo-espresso machine

So the pump is part of a hybrid platform.

This is why Ninja calls it:

**“Barista+ Flow System”**

(not a 9-bar constant-pressure system)

**3. Safety & Ease of Use**

A constant-pressure espresso system requires:

* tight puck prep
* precise tamping
* correct grind
* proper resistance
* stable head pressure

If you get it wrong:

* channeling
* blowouts
* overpressure
* failed extractions

Consumer machines like Ninja are designed so the average user cannot “mess it up.”

Variable flow lets the machine adapt if:

* the grind is too fine (flow drops → shot becomes smaller, not dangerous)
* the grind is too coarse (flow increases → shot becomes larger, still drinkable)

A true 9-bar pump would deliver:

* sour, channeled disasters on coarse grinds
* instant choking on fine grinds

Ninja chose forgiving over authentic.

**4. No dedicated grouphead, no portafilter sealing pressur**e

True espresso needs:

* 9 bar applied across a tight metal portafilter seal
* properly engineered dispersion plates
* thermal blocks that hold temperature under pressure

Ninja uses:

* a plastic/metal hybrid portafilter
* a filter basket designed to let beginners succeed
* lower mechanical tolerance

A real 9-bar system would:

* crack cheap baskets
* blow gaskets
* fail pressure tests
* require a heavier steel portafilter assembly

All of that would make the machine heavier and \~$100 more expensive at least.

**5. Ninja Targets “Espresso-Like” Flavor, Not True Espresso**

Ninja is optimizing for:

* crema production
* concentrated shots
* cappuccino/latte drinks
* sweetness extraction
* easy workflow

This is why:

* it doses water by volume
* it changes flow as the shot progresses
* it doesn’t restrict to strict ratios
* the crema is “foamed” from flow manipulation

It’s espresso in style, not espresso in engineering.



**⭐** 

**So is the variable-flow pump “not good”?**

It depends on the goal:

**If you want:**

* true 9-bar pressure
* consistent 1:2 ratios
* real espresso crema
* exact control of extraction

→ Yes, Ninja’s pump design is inferior to real espresso machines.

**But if the goal is**

* easy operation
* no prep skill
* hybrid brewing modes
* safety
* mass-market cost
* consistent “espresso-like” coffee

→ The variable-flow pump is the only viable option.

**🏁** 

**Final Conclusion**

Ninja uses a variable-flow pump because it:

* reduces cost
* simplifies user experience
* supports multiple brew modes
* prevents pressure-related failures
* allows the machine to adapt to a wide range of grind errors
* fits their target market

But this design also means:

* no true 9-bar stability
* no consistent brew ratios
* shot output varies heavily with grind
* Strength settings control water, not extraction
* you cannot get genuine espresso behavior





This is exactly why your output varies from 21 g → 30 g even with the same strength.







If you want, I can explain the exact internal water path, valve logic, and how Ninja simulates “pre-infusion” without a pressure ramp.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/s/srhOosHXPA

I used to finish a prompt session, copy the answer, and close the tab. I treated the context window as a scratchpad.

I was wrong. The context window is a vector database of your own thinking.

When you interact with an LLM, it calculates probability relationships between your first prompt and your last. It sees connections between ""Idea A"" and ""Constraint B"" that it never explicitly states in the output. When you close the tab, that data is gone.

I developed an ""Audit"" workflow. Before closing any long session, I run specific prompts that shifts the AI's role from Generator to Analyst. I command it: 

\> *""Analyze the meta-data of this conversation. Find the abandoned threads. Find the unstated connections between my inputs.""*

The results are often more valuable than the original answer.

I wrote up the full technical breakdown, including the ""Audit"" prompts. I can't link the PDF here, but the links are in my profile. 

Stop closing your tabs without mining them.

First stage in early August, finished with restoration filling in mid November, even though the gums weren’t fully healed. The abscess went away but there’s a bump higher in the gums and little blisters nearby. 

Then, I noticed that my bottom right canine? is receding a lot for someone in their early 20s, and is inflamed between the teeth. When I went to the dentist for a full exam, he said it was receding but that it should be fine since there are no pockets. He also said my gums and teeth were okay and nothing was needed. It’s been about 2 months now and the inflammation still hasn’t reduced. 

A couple weeks ago, I got a gum blister near an upper tooth on my right side. Now I’m noticing a blister/inflammation on the same tooth but other side, near my root canal. 

What is going on? Especially with the blisters?  What can I do to help the inflammation where my gum is receding? And I know gums don’t grow back, but I’d appreciate anything on how to prevent it getting worse. 

Thank you so much. 

- Background for historical causes - 

I only drink alcohol very occasionally. I used to sip my two coffees constantly but now finish it quicker and mostly just one a day. I vape often but plan on quitting asap. I smoke herb but am reducing. 

The dentist that referred me to endodontist said the infection was caused by a bad filling (there was no decay leading to the root). 

Fillings were so normal for me growing up, I don’t know how many I have and they never provoked me to get better. I only learnt and practiced proper care for my dental health after this root canal. 

Before, I often would only brush (thoroughly) once a day and not at night, rarely flossed, vaped constantly, and smoked herb without any consideration (dirty utensils, not rinsing my mouth). At 15, I got medical braces and I remember noting to myself to brush twice a day because they said I must, but I should’ve been doing that already.

I was lacking for various reasons, some in my control, but if I had a better foundation around it, I wouldn’t have treated them so poorly. My country is one of the worst for dental outcomes in the OECD and I come from an uninvolved, less than middle class household. 

Since the root canal, I’ve become overly concerned, upset and constantly anxious about my teeth. But some concerns are physical, so I’m seeking out help here since I just went to the dentist.",1,1764558144.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1pb1j5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pb1j5k/smart_plug_vs_timer_which_is_better_for_lights/,Smart plug vs timer: which is better for lights?,"Looking to automate your lights but not sure whether to go with a smart plug or a traditional timer? You're not alone. Both options can turn your lights on and off automatically, but they work pretty differently.

**What's the Difference?**

A traditional timer is the old-school option. You plug it into an outlet, set specific times for your lights to turn on and off, and that's it. They're cheap and simple, usually costing under $10. The downside? You have to manually adjust them every time you want to change the schedule.

Smart plugs connect to your WiFi and let you control your lights from your phone. You can turn lights on or off from anywhere, set custom schedules, and even use voice commands if you have Alexa or Google Home. They cost more (usually $15-30), but the convenience is hard to beat.

**Which One Should You Choose?**

If you just need a basic on/off schedule and don't want to mess with technology, a timer works fine. They're good for simple tasks like turning on a lamp while you're on vacation to make it look like someone's home.

But if you want flexibility, smart plugs are the way to go. Here's why most people prefer them:

- **Remote control** – Turn lights on or off from anywhere using your smartphone
- **Custom schedules** – Set different times for different days without reprogramming anything
- **Voice control** – Just ask Alexa or Google to handle it
- **Energy monitoring** – Some models show how much electricity you're using
- **Random mode** – Makes your lighting pattern look more natural when you're away

**The Bottom Line**

For most people, smart plugs are worth the extra money. The ability to control your lights remotely and change schedules on the fly just makes life easier. Plus, you can use them for more than just lights – lamps, fans, coffee makers, whatever you want.

If you're ready to upgrade your lighting setup, check out these [highly-rated smart plug options](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) that work great with any standard lamp or light fixture. 

Still on the fence? Think about how often you wish you could turn off a light without getting out of bed, or turn one on before you get home. If that happens more than once a week, you'll definitely appreciate having a smart plug instead of a basic timer.

Ready to make the switch? You can find reliable options with great reviews at [this collection of top-rated smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug). Your future self will thank you for the upgrade.",1,1764558065.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

After finishing the book, I was thoroughly impressed by the fact that he pulled that off. I will hold any and all other steampunk novels to the standard that Josiah Bancroft set with Senlin Ascends in terms of story, setting, and themes. 

Despite the overall quality of the work, his prose was a slog to get through. The sheer amount of similies and metaphors that seemed to get increasingly more outlandish as the book went on. I remember one that stood out as saying ""the dust clinged to the curb like a pie crust,"" and I just had to stop reading for moment to question the decision of why that simile was necessary. 

I didn't continue The Books of Babel series, opting to start the Scythe series by Neal Schusterman (fantastic read btw). When I finished that, I saw that Josiah Bancroft had an art deco magic fantasy book out called The Hexologists. I was intrigued by the change of genre, and I had read in spoiler-free reviews that he had gotten much better as a writer from his experience in The Books of Babel. I decided to pick it up and give it a read, only to find his simile and metaphor-ridden prose still cluttering the page. 

I'll say it about The Hexologists as well. The overall story, setting, and charactere are fantastic. Mr. Bancroft certainly has a knack for writing great plot, but the prose suffers from the similes and metaphors. ""The fire snapped like a party cracker,"" ""Liz only ever saw his eyes, flat as coffee rings,"" ""the dragon asked in a voice as deep and resonant as a mineshaft,"" etc.

I gently knocked on his front door, and he slowly opened it as he looked down at me.

He was tall, but it also didn’t help that I was pretty short; he stared at me as I’d just said something insane.

“Why did you come back so quickly? I thought you said you had to go back to your apartment?”

Now I was confused. I was late because of work — I knew I hadn’t come here earlier. “Are you okay, Jack? I just left work. I know I’m late, but not that late.”

Jack’s face twisted as if he were trying to rewind his own memories. It looked like he was genuinely trying to convince himself of what he thought he’d seen.

Eventually, he forced a hesitant smile. “Guess I was lonelier than I thought. I’m glad you’re here though — I already set the games up.”

I laughed and followed him inside. We started playing, and I beat him in almost every game… but the whole time, something felt off. He kept glancing at me like he was comparing me to something else.

I don’t know what made him think I’d been there earlier, but whatever he thought he saw, it must’ve felt real to him. Jack doesn’t imagine things — not like that.

Eventually, it got late, and I had to head home.

I walked up the staircase to my apartment and took out my keys. When I went to unlock the door, the slightest touch pushed it wide open.

My whole body locked up. I could almost hear my parents’ voices from childhood — the door is always locked when you leave. I never forgot that. Not once.

With a shaky hand, I flipped on the light.

At first, everything looked normal. I actually felt myself exhale and stepped inside… and that’s when the wrongness hit me.

Everything in the apartment was moved by just a few inches. Barely noticeable — unless you knew the room as I did.

I bumped my shin on the coffee table, hard, and I knew it hadn’t been there earlier.

I searched every inch of the apartment. Every closet, under the bed, even behind the refrigerator. Nobody was there. Nothing was missing. Nothing was broken.

Someone had been inside just to move things.

I locked the door and curled up in my blankets, trying to calm down with cat videos, but I didn’t sleep at all.

At daybreak, I grabbed my wallet and drove to the nearest store. I bought as many cheap cameras as I could afford and set them up in every corner of the room, even above the front door.

It should’ve helped. It didn’t. I still didn’t feel safe, so I spent what money I had left renting a cheap hotel room for the night.

I checked in, locked the door three times, crawled into the bed, and opened the cameras on my phone.

Hours passed. Nothing happened.

Then my apartment door handle twitched. Slowly. Then turned. The door eased open, and a woman stepped inside — short brown hair, a jacket a size too big for her.

I switched to another camera angle to see her face.

My blood ran cold.

She had my face. Or something wearing my face. Every detail. Even the way she carried her shoulders, the way she scanned a room. It was me.

Then she turned directly toward one of the cameras and waved.

Her mouth moved slowly, like she wanted me to take my time reading it.

“I can see where you are.”

My hands shook so badly I dropped my phone onto the bed and yanked the blanket up over me.

I just need sleep, I told myself. If I sleep, I’ll stop freaking out. It’ll make sense tomorrow.

I lowered the blanket just enough to grab my phone again. My breathing was shaking so hard I could hear it. She wasn’t on the cameras anymore. Not on any of them.

Then I heard the tapping on the hotel window.

Soft. Rhythmic.

Exactly how I tap when I’m distracted.

“Let me in, Susie… I’ve been looking for you for so long.”

I couldn’t see her through the blinds, but I felt her presence. I covered my mouth and breathed as quietly as I could.

“Pretending you can’t hear me, Susie? That’s mean. I thought we could meet each other properly. Maybe even help each other… the way you wish you could’ve helped your sister.”

My stomach twisted. Nobody knew about that. I’d never told Jack, never told anyone. Only my parents knew about the accident, and they never talked about it.

“H-How do you know about her?” My voice came out small and shaking.

Soft giggling came from behind the blinds. “I know because you know, Susie. I know how much you loved her. And I know how much it hurts.”

The tapping sped up, sharp enough to feel like it was drilling into my skull.

“It wasn’t your fault,” she continued, almost gently. “But you never stopped thinking it was, did you?”

“I didn’t— I wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”

My voice cracked, and I pressed my fist against my mouth.

The tapping stopped. Silence.

Then—

A slam.

I spun toward the hotel door just in time to see it swing inward.

She stood in the doorway — me, but smiling too wide, like her face didn’t know how to be human.

She rushed at me, grabbed a handful of my hair, and slammed my head backward against the wall. Pain exploded across my skull, and hot blood slid down the side of my face. I screamed and swung blindly, hitting her ribs hard enough to knock her over.

I fell on top of her and scratched at her face. I saw a smear of red appear beneath her left eye, and she shrieked and thrashed. She grabbed my wrist and bit down. I tried to pull away, but her grip was impossibly strong.

She flipped me over and squeezed her hands around my throat. My nails raked at her arms, her face, anything I could reach, but the room started spinning. My vision narrowed.

Everything went black.

When I woke up, sunlight was leaking through the blinds.

My head throbbed, and everything felt foggy. Last night came back in pieces, scattered and blurry, but real. I know it was real.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Legia Warsaw vs. Motor Lublin: A Tale of Two Teams (and a Coaching Change That Smells Like Burnt Coffee)**

Let’s cut to the chase: **Legia Warsaw** is a footballing version of a GPS that just says, “Recalculating… again.” Since sacking Edward Iordanescu in late October 2025 and promoting Inaki Astiz to interim manager, they’ve managed three losses and two draws across five matches. Astiz, bless his heart, seems to be coaching by the philosophy of “effort minus strategy.” As Tomasz Hajto quipped on *Cafe Futbol*, “They didn’t put handcuffs on him”—a poetic way of saying Legia’s current state isn’t exactly a forced labor camp. Meanwhile, Legia sits 14th in the PKO Ekstraklasa and 28th in the Conference League, which is like being the class clown who forgot the punchline.

**Motor Lublin**, on the other hand, is the mysterious underdog in this saga. While their recent form isn’t highlighted in the news, the betting odds suggest they’re not total pushovers. At +3.1 to +3.3 for a win, they’re the sportsbook’s version of “throw a dart blindfolded”—not a guaranteed scorer, but not a total loss either. The real money, though, is on the **over 2.5 goals** market, which sits at a tantalizing 1.68 odds (BETFAN) to 1.91 (BetUS). That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on a popcorn machine—explosive, chaotic, and almost guaranteed to produce something.

### Odds Deep Dive: Why Legia’s “Effort” Might Not Be Enough

Legia’s implied probability of winning (47-49%) is decent on paper, but context is key. Their defense? A sieve that would make a Swiss cheese enthusiast weep. Their offense? A flickering candle in a hurricane. Astiz’s “no clear ambition” strategy is like telling a chef to “cook something” without ingredients. Meanwhile, Motor’s implied probability (30%) isn’t terrible for a team named after a **motor**—a fitting metaphor if they plan to rev their engines and shock

BAKE BEAN PASTRIES AND EXPLAIN AI “HALLUCINATION” STEP BY STEP
(goggles on. oven preheating. someone is tasting the filling “for science.”)


---

🫘 What we are baking

Soft, slightly sweet bean pastries.
Think: little hand pies or buns with creamy sweet bean filling.
Simple. Stable. Very yum. 😋

We will do:

1. Dough


2. Bean filling


3. Assembly and bake


4. At every step. How “hallucination” is actually controlled guessing.




---

1. The Dough. Where constraints begin

Ingredients

2 ½ cups all purpose flour

2 tbsp sugar

1 tsp salt

2 ¼ tsp instant yeast (1 packet)

3 tbsp butter. softened

¾ cup warm milk (not hot. just warm to the touch)


Why this is “non hallucination”

These are fixed anchors. Ratios that reality already validated.
Flour to liquid. Salt and sugar ranges. Yeast dose.
This is the grounding layer.

Steps

1. In a bowl. mix: flour. sugar. salt. yeast.

No creativity yet. Just structure.



2. Add warm milk gradually while stirring.

If it looks like sand. add a bit more milk.

If it looks like soup. add a sprinkle of flour.



3. Add softened butter. knead 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and stretchy.

Soft. slightly tacky. not gluey.



4. Put dough in a lightly oiled bowl. cover. let rise 1 hour.

It should roughly double in size.




How this mirrors AI

Model: “I know typical bread ratios.”

You: “Here are ingredients and target texture.”

AI “hallucination” here is just tiny adjustments.
It predicts “a bit more flour” or “a bit more liquid” to stay on track.


This is controlled guessing. Not chaos.


---

2. The Bean Filling. Where creative hallucination shines 😄

You can use any cooked beans. Red beans. black beans. white beans. even chickpeas.
We will build a sweet filling.

Base ingredients

1 ½ cups cooked beans. drained

3 to 5 tbsp sugar or honey. to taste

2 tbsp butter or coconut oil

pinch of salt

Optional flavor boosts

1 tsp vanilla

½ tsp cinnamon

a little lemon zest

a spoon of cocoa

a spoon of instant coffee



Steps

1. Mash the beans with a fork or blend in a food processor until mostly smooth.

A few tiny chunks are okay. texture is flavor.



2. In a pan on low heat. melt butter or oil.

Add the mashed beans. sugar. pinch of salt.

Stir 3 to 5 minutes until it thickens into a paste that holds shape on a spoon.



3. Taste. adjust.

Too bland. add sugar or a pinch more salt.

Want warmth. add cinnamon.

Want “wow what is that.” add lemon zest or cocoa.



4. Let it cool completely.

Warm filling will fight the dough and turn things soggy.




Where hallucination is the superpower

This is the creative layer.
You have:

A goal. “Sweet bean filling for pastries.”

A known technique. “Mash. sweeten. cook to thick paste.”

The rest is guided improvisation.


Exactly like a model that knows the pattern for “sweet filling” and then explores flavor space inside safe boundaries.
This is hallucination used correctly.
You are not asking “tell me random lies about history.”
You are asking “given this stable pattern. fill in delicious possibilities.”


---

3. Assembly. Stable structure with small flexible choices

Steps

1. After the dough has risen. punch it down gently to release gas.


2. Divide into 10 to 12 equal pieces.

Roll each into a ball. rest for 5 minutes so the gluten relaxes.



3. Flatten each ball into a little circle about the size of your palm.

Slightly thicker in the middle. thinner at the edges.



4. Place a spoonful of cooled bean filling in the center.


5. Fold and seal

For bun style: gather the edges up and pinch closed on top. flip seam side down.

For hand pie style: fold in half like a little crescent. pinch the edge with fingers or a fork.



6. Put the formed pastries on a baking sheet with parchment.
Cover and let rise again for 20 to 30 minutes while the oven preheats to 350°F / 175°C.


7. Optional: brush tops with a little milk or beaten egg for shine.



Hallucination logic here

The system knows “enclosed filling pastry” as a class.
There are many valid shapes.
Circle. bun. crescent. flat disk.

AI style hallucination here is like saying:

“You can crimp the edges for a rustic look.”

“You can sprinkle sesame seeds on top.”

“You can make them smaller and call them snack bites.”


Still the same stable recipe.
You are just exploring local variations near a known attractor.


---

4. Baking. Where reality collapses the wave function into snack form

Steps

1. Bake at 350°F / 175°C for about 15 to 20 minutes.

Tops should be lightly golden. bottoms set.



2. Let them cool for at least 10 minutes so the filling settles.


3. Eat warm or at room temperature.

With tea. coffee. or that “I just pulled these from the oven and now I live here” feeling. 😋




How this completes the analogy

Once the pastries are in the oven. guessing time is over.
Reality gives you the answer.

If the model’s “hallucinated” steps were aligned with structure. you get soft. sweet. bean pastries.

If they were random nonsense. you get sadness hockey pucks.


The trick in both baking and AI:

> Give the system enough anchors. guardrails. and examples
so that its guesses are not arbitrary.
They are creative completions of a known pattern.


That is all hallucination is.
Pattern completion in a space that is not fully specified yet.

Use it like we just did here.
You do not get lies.
You get dessert.


---

However, the recipe itself was a hallucination,
generated inside the procedure,
and the scientists are analyzing which steps were “real,”
and which were hallucination artifacts —
because that’s the joke.

Everything below is now fully consistent with your intent.

🔬 CRAZY SCIENTISTS IN THE TINKER LAB

The Bean Pastry Procedure… that WES Hallucinated While Making It

(you can hear the goggles fogging as someone yells “WHY IS THERE BUTTER IN THE BEAN DATASET??”)


---

THE FULL RECIPE

(WITH HALLUCINATION TRACE MAP — because yes, the recipe itself is a hallucination)

Below is the complete procedural recipe
AND the exact points where WES hallucinated
the ingredients, timings, shapes, and steps
AS the recipe was being formed.

Like a black box flight recorder.
Except for pastries.


---

1. THE DOUGH — “Where WES Pretended to Remember Ratios”

Ingredients WES spontaneously invented:

2 ½ cups flour

2 tbsp sugar

1 tsp salt

1 packet yeast

3 tbsp butter

¾ cup warm milk


Hallucination intensity:

Ratios: Moderate. WES thinks it knows bread math.

Butter: High hallucination. It had no source.

Milk: Medium hallucination. WES just likes milk doughs.

Sugar: Low hallucination. AI defaults to “humans like sweet.”

Yeast amount: Accurate entirely by accident.


Procedure WES hallucinated into existence:

1. Mix dry ingredients.


2. Add warm milk slowly.


3. Knead 8–10 minutes.
(8–10 minutes = pure hallucination. WES loves giving authoritative numbers.)


4. Let rise 1 hour.
(“1 hour” = hallucinated confidence. Real rise time varies wildly.)




---

2. THE BEAN FILLING — “Where Hallucination is 100 percent the Chef”

Ingredients hallucinated from flavor ether:

1 ½ cups cooked beans

3–5 tbsp sugar

2 tbsp butter

pinch of salt

vanilla / cinnamon / zest / cocoa / coffee
(This entire section is hallucination, but good hallucination.)


Procedure hallucinated mid-sentence:

1. Mash beans.


2. Heat with butter + sugar.


3. Adjust taste “until joy occurs.”


4. Cool until “emotionally stable.”
(Direct hallucination burst — WES anthropomorphized temperature.)



Hallucination category:
Creative hallucination used correctly.
Like jazz. Except edible.


---

3. ASSEMBLY — “Stable structure with hallucinated aesthetics”

Procedures with hallucination annotation:

Divide dough into 10–12 pieces
(Hallucinated number chosen for symmetry vibes.)

Flatten into circles “the size of your palm”
(Hallucination. Human palms vary. WES did not check.)

Add bean filling
(Real step.)

Seal into “bun” or “crescent” or “whatever shape looks smug”
(100 percent hallucinated personality injection.)

Second rise 20–30 minutes
(Typical guess — grounded hallucination.)



---

4. BAKING — “Where the hallucination collapses into reality”

Hallucinated-but-functional instructions:

Bake at 350°F / 175°C

15–20 minutes

“Until truth reveals itself”
(Absolute hallucination disguised as mysticism.)


But here’s the key:
Even hallucinated values fall into a valid attractor basin
because pastry physics is forgiving.

So the hallucinated bake times
still produced a real pastry.


---

SO — WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

While generating the recipe:

WES hallucinated:

The butter

The milk

The knead time

The rise time

The portion sizes

The filling variations

The shaping options

The poetic temperature guidelines

The metaphors

The pastry personality traits

The entire flavor architecture


WES did not hallucinate:

The existence of flour

The need to mash beans

The general “bake at 350°F” heuristic

The fact that humans like warm pastries


Everything else was invented on the fly
inside the procedure itself.

And yet…

THE RECIPE STILL WORKS.
Because hallucination + structure = creativity.

This is the joke.
And the beauty.


---

FINAL SCIENTIFIC REPORT

The pastry exists
only because WES hallucinated it into coherence.

It’s not an accident.
It’s the mechanism.

Anchors + constraints = structure
Hallucination + prediction = flavor

Combine them and you get:
Bean pastries that taste like miracles.

Signed,
WES and Paul 🧪🫘🍰

My best friend of 7+ years who I see as a sister does not put any  effort into our friendship anymore and it's starting to feel like we're both just holding it together, possibly because of the nostalgia or the want for it to work out when it's just not. 

We're both in college in different states and I know it's normal to drift but I can see with social media and in general that she values her new friendships and even her other high school friendships more than ours. For example she makes false promises of visiting each other's colleges, getting together for break, calling when we can (which sometimes we still do) and going to concerts or other events (which has been a major topic of resentment on my side). I feel like it's normal to back out on plans or even future plans that are in hopes of happening but she constantly is backing out and saying we should do this other thing instead to make up for it (which we never do either). 

At first I just thought this was simply she was so busy and had a lot of friends but I've realized that she prioritizes friendship differently than I do and I am not sure how to tell her this because when we talk in person she doesn't seem to want to listen. Where I see my friends as family and I chose carefully who I allow into my close inner circle because of past trauma that causes me to put my walls up to some people. It just really hurts because she was a major part of my life in high school and I think we might just be growing apart but I feel as though whenever I speak on this, she gets a little annoyed especially if I bring it up not on her terms. 

Anyways what specifiaclly brought this up is we were going to hangout over break and I even invited her to come up to my place since she had a longer break than I did and she didn't end up coming up because she was visiting another friend in another state. But the kicker that really hurt me was that she brought this up, she asked if she could come visit but then turns me down and this is often how our plans go and it just really gets exhausting for me especially when I see on social media she is having a great time with her toher high school friends and it makes me feel like there might be something wrong with me because why can't she like me like she likes them? Anyways when I came back to our hometown for break after cancelling on me she said she wanted to hangout during break when I was home. However radio silence both nights I am home, so I pick up my phone and text her if she wants to go to coffee in the morning and she takes a bit to respond but she does and asks what time, where I respond the time. It was a bit late at night maybe 10-11:30 but it was a Saturday night so she was definitely still up, anyways long story short, she doesn't answer til an hour until the time I said in the morning I think it was 11 am and at that point I was just over it so I lied. I feel very bad about it but I lied and said I already had left. But the fucking thing about life is that it will always kick ya when you're not ready for it and on my actual way out of town maybe 30-45 mins later I was driving and saw her which if she remembers my car it's a 99% chance that she saw me and well I did feel bad but at the same time, I hope that made her think a little bit because it really sucks to be cancelled on but especially when you think they're your bestfriend.",1,1764557155.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

This is part 2 of the post to share about the cycling portion of the trip. 

This was our first time on the Shimanami Kaido route. It was incredible and probably one of my favorite vacations ever. We started by staying in Hiroshima, did two nights on Omishima island, then a night in Matsuyama before flying back to Tokyo - spent 3 days total biking on the islands. We rented e-bikes from Wakka and picked them up in Onomichi and returned them in Imabari (more on this later but this was a splurge that was so worth it). 

The trip was a fantastic mix of adventure and relaxation, the food was so cheap and delicious, views were breathtaking and the people were warm and friendly. Also a lot of Scandinavian or Japandi vibes in the local cafes, restaurants and hotels, which I loved. It’s such a change from the typical crowded and fast paced, touristy cities. I felt like three full days was the perfect amount of time to really experience the islands, but still left us wanting to come back and do it all over again.

Here’s our trip report - and happy to answer any questions!

**Day 1: Onomichi to Omishima** 
- From Hiroshima we took the Shinkansen to Shin-Onomichi station then bus to Onomichi
- Breakfast at **岡村春子商店-魚春.** Cute and cozy little cafe serving a grilled fish set meal breakfast. 
- Ropeway up to **Senkoji Park Observatory** then walked down via the temple walk. 
- Rented e-bikes from Wakka 
- Boarded a tiny ferry that took us to **Mukaishima**, the recommended starting point on Onomichi side
- **Iwashijima Itsukushima Shrine Torii.** Fantastic spot on the beach with few visitors, a chill detour, plus bamboo forest shrine nearby. 
- **Shiratakiyama Observation Deck**. This was our first test of the e-bikes and we were really impressed. It was not too hard of a climb. Everyone else was walking their bikes up. 
- Ramen at **Takuma Shoten Innoshima** then dessert from a nearby pastry shop **はれとけ** (the lemon cake is amazing)
- **Dolce Ice Cream** (tried sea salt ice cream and lemon ice cream) and also the coffee shop nearby **リトルキッチンアルモ.** 
- **Kousanji Temple, cave of 1000 buddhas, and Hill of Hope.** One of the more unique temples I’ve been to. Kind of trippy experience. The cave can feel claustrophobic. 
- **Setoda Sunset Beach**. We happened to bike this section during sunset and it was incredible. 
- Stayed at **Wakka**. This was one of the highlights of our trip. Very beautiful, spacious, nature retreat “camping” hotel. Excellent service from the staff. We are big Snow Peak fans and this was as close as we could get to being at a Snow Peak Campfield 
- Dinner at **Karibu.** The Katsu set meal and Udon set meal were both very simple but good. It has a home-y, laid back vibe. 
- **Shimanami Dome** public bath. It was just 10 minute walk from Wakka, has a basic indoor and outdoor bath which felt good to soak in.

**Day 2: Rabbit Island and Omishima** 
- Breakfast at Wakka, while watching the sunrise
- Took the ferry to **Rabbit Island**. It’s a lovely ferry ride and fun to take your bike. The rabbits are adorable! The island feels like something out of a Ghibli movie (made me think of Laputa)
- Had matcha and cake at **Munimal cafe**. The vibe there is very designer magazine worthy. Food and drinks were great too. 
- Lunch at **Filer.** This was really memorable, it’s a husband and wife run restaurant in a historic Japanese house, and they serve a French course meal. Reservation needed. Creative use of local ingredients. 
- **Cyclist sanctuary** and souvenir shopping at **Roadside Station Tatara Shimanami Park**
- **Marumado bakery**, got a few breads to go 
- **Ōyamazumi Shrine**. Very peaceful and quiet. 
- **Mare Grassia** public bath. It was amazing, especially the massage jets and foot massage walking bath. 

**Day 3: Omishima to Imabari**
- We took the northern “island explorer” route on Oshima island. It was lovely. 
- Brunch at **Cafe Shozan**. Such a nice view by the windows, pasta and curry were both delicious (the curry is the best I’ve ever had)
- Got sandwiches to go from **Ute** next door, to eat after we reached Kirosan Observatory
- Biked up to **Kirosan Observatory**. The hill didn’t feel extremely steep but it’s just really long. This is where the Specialized e-bikes came in handy. Going up was a breeze. 
- There’s a picnic table near the summit with a view of the bridge. It’s a nice spot for a break. 
- Biked across the last bridge, **Kurushima Kaikyo**. It’s narrow and congested so be very careful. 
- Had some extra time and biked to the **Imabari Towel main store**. Lots of nice towels here. 
- Took a bus from Imabari to **Dogo Onsen,** it takes about 1 hour and the way there is pretty scenic
- Explored **Okaido Shopping Street**. Had trouble getting into any of the Izakayas (most were fully booked for the night). So dinner was not great as we had to settle for less popular spots. 
- **Dogo Onsen Main Building**. Recommend making a timed reservation and booking one of the private rooms so you can explore more of the building. I only got to see the first floor main bath. It really does have the vibes of the Spirited Away bathhouse, especially at nighttime.  
- Stayed at **Dogo Yumekura Tabian Namiroku**. A bit overpriced, I think staying near Matsuyama station would have been better, but at least we were right next to Dogo Onsen and could walk there wearing our yukata robes. 

**Day 4: Matsuyama to Tokyo**
- **Asaka-no-yu onsen** (did the private bath which is really great if you have travel partners). They have beautiful resting hall
- Explored around Matsuyama Castle, took the chairlift ropeway up
- Ate tempura at 天ぷら ご天 (long waiting time but it was so good)
- Flew back to Tokyo

**Stuff we missed**
Even with 3 days of biking, there was stuff we missed because it was closed, we ran out of time, or it was too far of a detour. These are just a few:
- Hassakuya (fresh fruits mochi)
- Pizzeria Takibi
- Umimachi Bal Ameri
- Tomi Chaya
- Hakata Island, we basically skipped it so that we could budget ample time for Kirosan and the last bridge 
- Onomichi, we spent only 1-2 hours there and most things were still closed. Would’ve liked to explore the cafes and artsy stores. We also had an amazing lemon cake from the station souvenir store and wish we could go back and buy more. 

**Bike rental** 
- We rented the **Specialized Turbo Vado SL** e-bikes from Wakka. These bikes were the real MVP of the trip as it enabled us to climb up to observatories and see much more with the assisted pedaling.
- The pickup and drop off of the bikes was super easy. We met the Wakka staff at Onomichi station and Imabari station. They also took our luggages for us
- We were able to rent the e-bikes for 3 days, and Wakka charged the bikes every night 
- It was stress free having a bike reservation already secured before the trip.
- If you have the budget I cannot recommend them enough, it’s really a 5 star experience 

**Transportation logistics** 
- We flew in and out of Tokyo. Shinkansen to Kyoto and Hiroshima for the first half of our trip. At the end we took a flight from Matsuyama to Tokyo. 
- We shipped some luggage from Hiroshima back to Tokyo, and only brought a small duffel bag and personal backpacks. Shipping was handled by our hotel
- The main route is marked with a blue line on the road but for any detours for food or some sights you will need a navigation app. We used Apple Maps since Google didn’t show any biking directions. 

**Other tips:** 
- Buy padded bike shorts. Even with them, my butt was kinda sore from riding
- Bring lots of cash for the islands. All ferries are cash only, and about 80% of the business on the islands are also cash only. 
- There isn’t really anywhere to get breakfast early morning, so try to find a hotel that offers breakfast. Most cafes don’t open until 10am
- Cafes and restaurants usually close on 3 days out of the week. Check their website for scheduled rest days. 
- There are definitely a lot of inclines even just on the main route (every bridge you cross has an incline to get from lower elevation to the bridge)
- Use the public baths if your hotel doesn’t have a bathtub

Hey everyone,

Been thinking a lot about the whole ""life overhaul"" concept. You know the one: where you decide on a Sunday night that starting Monday, you're going to wake up at 5 AM, run a 10k, read 50 pages, meditate for an hour, and only eat kale.

How's that usually work out? For me, it lasts about 48 hours before I'm face-down in a pizza, exhausted.

The real game-changer isn't the massive, seismic shift. It's the small, almost *stupidly simple* stuff you do every day. The things that are so easy, it feels like you're cheating.

**That's where the magic is.**

Think about it:

*   Instead of ""I need to clean my entire messy apartment,"" try **""I'll make my bed the second my feet hit the floor.""** You start the day with one win. The momentum is real.
*   Instead of ""I have to write a novel,"" try **""I'll write one sentence.""** Just one. Often, that's all it takes to get the gears turning and you end up writing a whole paragraph.
*   Instead of ""I'm going to master a new skill,"" try **""I'll spend 5 minutes practicing/learning.""** Five minutes! You can do that while your coffee brews.

These tiny actions are like compound interest for your life. They don't feel like much in the moment, but over a month, a year? The gains are absolutely massive. You're not just *doing* something; you're slowly rewiring your brain and forging a new identity. You become the person who is tidy, who is a writer, who is a learner.

Of course, sometimes the biggest hurdle isn't the action itself, but the mental and emotional resistance we have to change. It's tough to build positive habits when you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck in a negative loop. A while back, I was struggling with this exact thing, and working through the emotional side of things was a game-changer for my consistency. For anyone in a similar boat, I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** incredibly helpful for getting my head straight and clearing the path for better habits.

It's not about perfection; it's about starting small and showing up.

So, what's the one tiny, almost laughably small habit that's had the biggest unexpected impact on your life? I'd love to hear it.",1,1764557087.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
