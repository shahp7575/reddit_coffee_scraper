1kzmzce,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1kzmzce/finding_sustainable_cure_for_lpr_after_several/,Finding sustainable cure for LPR after several failures,"Recently, I‚Äôve experienced a significant improvement in my LPR symptoms, and I wanted to share what I‚Äôve learned from past failure.

I‚Äôve suffered from a persistent tickling sensation deep inside my right clavicle whenever I speak nearly 10 years. Just last month, things got so emotionally overwhelming that I found myself having very dark thoughts.

I had previously tried to follow Acid Watcher Diet and reduce my acid intake, but I always failed to sustain it. 

The reason was that avoiding spicy, sour, fried, and many common foods led to rapid weight loss and I really hated how I looked when I lost too much weight. 

And furthermore losing tasty food in daily life made me depressed. I mean.. most beverages sold at grocery stores are acidic, and even though I knew that, I couldn‚Äôt easily stop drinking them. Fruit juice comforted me when I was annoyed from a sore throat. Giving them up felt as hard for me as it is for a typical office worker to quit coffee. 

So I gone through so many success and failure process like this below 

Stop all beverage and hot, fried food ‚≠¢ symptoms improved but lose too much weight and joy of eating ‚≠¢ Fuck off. I will eat and drink whatever I want ‚≠¢ Sore throat again

But recently, I started focusing on replacements. I used to be afraid of losing weight, which kept me from managing my diet properly. But thanks to GPT, I found eating avocados helps for LPR sufferers. They‚Äôre gentle on the esophagus and don‚Äôt cause weight loss(Of course there's exception)

And I found some appropriate food which is good for LPR and have decent taste such as smoked salmon and boiled eggs. Also I started eating alkaline fruits like watermelon instead of fruit juices. And instead of deep-fried chicken, I go for lightly pan-fried versions. This way, I‚Äôve managed to maintain my weight and drastically improve my esophageal health. 

For the first time yesterday, I actually began to believe that complete healing might be possible.
 
I know fighting with LPR is horrible. But Finding sustainable replacement food might be good tactics for LPR sufferers. Thank you.",1,1748660679.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1kzmytb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1kzmytb/almost_20_and_have_never_had_a_natural_period/,Almost 20 and have never had a natural period,"I have never had a period other than 2 times when taking the pill just so my doctors could rule out structural abnormalities that would stop me from bleeding. I have had an ultrasound as well and everything was normal. My bloodwork obviously shows extremely low estrogen levels. I developed an eating disorder when I was 12 but went into recovery pretty quickly afterwards (I was only fully actively engaging in my eating disorder for maybe 4 months). Since then I have been on at least some form of meal plan. I even drank ensure plus drinks for 5 years. Even during my ED, I never skipped a meal. Despite my best efforts to gain weight, it's been very difficult due to my fast metabolism. I think it has something to do with the fact that I never fully went through puberty so my body still ""thinks"" I'm growing. Right now, I eat 4 meals and 1 snack per day. I make sure to eat within 30 minutes of waking up, I don't drink coffee or caffeine, I don't do much exercise, and I eat tons of healthy fats and lots of carbs. For example, I eat peanut butter at least once daily, eat full avocados regularly, and cook with butter and/or oil. I also eat lots of eggs, fruit, some veggies, as well as nuts and seeds. All in all, I eat a very balanced and consistent diet. Is there anything I'm missing or does anyone else have a similar experience to me where they didn't get a period until their 20's?",1,1748660631.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

This morning I went to grab a coffee and go for an early morning walk. There's a war memorial just around the corner from where I live, commemorating the soldiers who lost their lives in WW2. I stood and looked at all the names and thought to myself, if they had known what the future would look like, this degenerate unhinged society, would they have bothered to stand up and fight? What exactly was it that they gave their lives for? Not for this. It was only 2 generations ago, blood was shed for freedom. Not freedom to be woke, but freedom from oppression. ^This^ is oppression in a very different form, wearing a different face, but it is oppression nonetheless. 

Seriously, what would our Grandparents say if they saw this? I am sure every single one of them would say that this is not the future they envisioned for their descendants.

1kzmx8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1kzmx8f/i_scheduled_my_masturbation_sessions_to_hit_200/,I scheduled my masturbation sessions to hit 200 orgasms in May. It accidentally improved my life.,"May is the International Masturbation Month. I set myself a personal challenge to do 200 orgasms in May. That's 200 individual wanks in a month.

That goes to be around 6,45 orgasms per day. And you don‚Äôt get those kinds of numbers without dedication. Or planning for that sake.

After some days, I realized that spontaneous sessions weren‚Äôt going to cut it. I was already falling behind. So I did what any responsible adult would do: I made a schedule. Looking back I should have known better. When I did the 12 in 24 hour challenge, I had to schedule my wanks to accomplish it.

So I wrote down approxemently times in my calendar like it was a workout plan:

* 07:30: ""Good morning Creampuff""
* 10:15: ""After coffee release""
* 13:00: "" Lunchpie""
* 16:00: ""Productivity Booster""
* 19:30: ""Evening load into Creampuff""
* 22:30: ""The Goodnight wank""

And sometimes a 3AM I got the ""the wet dream"" experience.

My Fleshlight, Creampuff, eventually started asking for vacation days. I denied here request.

It worked. Not just for the challenge (which I‚Äôm on track to complete). But for my actual life also. I got more things done. I got less anxious because I knew what was coming for me each day. I started eating regularly (witch is good for me). I even cleaned my home sometimes in the waiting period.

Scheduling my orgasms actually gave me a reason to structure my day. I woke up earlier with motivation to do my ""job"". I don't have to job right now so that was nice. And somehow, in the middle of all this May challange chaos, I have became a better version of myself.

Im proud of myself today. I am really nailing this challenge and I don't care what anyone else think about this achievement. Stop hiding things that make you feel good.

TL;dr: Aiming for the 200 orgasms in May challenge. Started scheduling them like meetings. Accidentally improved my mental health, productivity, and daily routine. I don't give a fuck what you think of this achievement.",1,1748660493.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

1kzmwu4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzmwu4,I just finished dragrace UK season 2 and‚Ä¶,"Holy ****. Why was that the best season I‚Äôve ever watched? Uhm‚Ä¶ I have a million opinions, as I normally do LOL

((spoilers ahead))

Joe Black:: Woah?? Uhm‚Ä¶ was so not expecting them to be first boot. Shook boots.

Cherry Valentine:: I really loved her personality and wish she could‚Äôve gotten another round. The gag is‚Äî Tia Kofi should‚Äôve been in the bottom this round anyways so‚Ä¶ Unfortunate. Also, love that you‚Äôre a nurse bb, do your thing ‚ù§Ô∏è

Astina:: ‚Ä¶. no seriously‚Ä¶ gagged bitch. I was living for her and at this point of the competition, my winner picks were her and Lawrence. This was a shock but like also‚Ä¶ wtf were you doing in that lipsync girl.. made me expect tricks and flips and death drop extravaganza but‚Ä¶ as it played out I honestly still didn‚Äôt think it mattered. I figured Tia was out regardless. Ru really gagged me with this one. I hope to see her on an all stars.

Ginny Lemon:: I wish you would‚Äôve just lip synced, like cmon. This was no where near Ben Dela Cr√®me level, this was just‚Ä¶ :///. I did like her though, especially when she put on pads and tits for the first time. But the cast is thinning babes‚Äî and unfortunately she was not ready to compete against the rest.

Veronica Green:: can‚Äôt wait to see you next season girlie‚Äî I was so excited for you to continue but now you have some time to polish yourself. I‚Äôm expecting perfection babes‚Ä¶ see you soonüíã

Episode Five:: (enter Joe Black) Yeah so this episode was fire, it needs its own review. UKD crushed it and I‚Äôm actually disappointed we couldn‚Äôt get critiques on the winners lewks. But what a phenomenal way to return after seven months‚Äî Ru‚Äôs crash out?? NO H&M, I‚Äôm crying.

Joe Black pt2:: So for me, it‚Äôs one of two things. Either he‚Äôs truly just delusional and everyone around him feeds into this delusion OR‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs just from a different type/era of drag. He clearly exudes the confidence of someone who should perform well/ do well. Something‚Äôs not adding up and it has to be that the rest of the cast is more ‚Äúthis day and age drag‚Äù. And not just his wardrobe, but the way he lipsyncs and performs and sings. Does that make sense? I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing him again, but seriously.. NO H&M!!!

Tia Kofi:: I have a lot to say but I want to keep it sweet. Keep in mind I just binged this okay. But Tia Kofi was‚Ä¶ not my cup of tea. Or coffee. Listen, the bitch was funny, yes. Her confessionals made me laugh and her underdog story was fun‚Äî until it wasn‚Äôt anymore. In a way, I understood Awhoras frustration when saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching all these amazing queens leave and Tias still here‚Äù Like yeah‚Ä¶ kinda very much that. Gag it. BUTTTT before you crucify me, I would live for her to return and learn how to work her body. If she came back and could turn a lewk. Over.

Sister Sister:: No shade but‚Ä¶ I just never vibed with this Queen. I did LOVE her entrance lips, I thought it was fun and unique but she didn‚Äôt wow me after that. And then she came back with some of the heaviest drag delusion of the season, idk. If I saw her again, she‚Äôd really need to wow me.

A‚ÄôWhora:: NOOOOOO so sad, especially her and Tayce against each other.. the queens left are sooooo good at this point, I see why she was sent home. Does anyone know what she actually said during her standup? Anyway‚Äî I love that she was the cunty, messy queen of the season. She truly was like if.. Adore +. Valentina + Violet Chachki all had a three way baby in the UK. That would be Awhora and bitch was she fierce. Neeeeed her on all stars ASAP.

Ellie Diamond:: Girl‚Ä¶ give her a couple years. This bitch can PAINT bitch like, wow. It was just unfortunate that her looks (even though she spent a good portion of the completions in or near the top) never were able to beat out another queens. She was always just a bit short. But if she had time bitch‚Äî pls. It‚Äôs over for everyone.

Tayce:: This bitch was THAT bitch through and through this season. I absolutely lived for her and basically anything that came out of her mouth. Fierce yet nice and congenial (it seems). I would think she‚Äôd win Miss Congeniality but also idk. I need her and Awhora on all starts together pronto.

Bimini Bon Boulash:: Crushed. No shade, I wanted her to win so bad üò≠üò≠ Listen. As I said in my first Joe Black comment‚Äî I was rooting for Joe in that first lipsync against Bimini. I didn‚Äôt exactly care for her in the first few episodes (even though her confessionals made me laugh). But something happened over that break bitch.. because I could not keep a smile off my face when she was on the screen. Her confessionals cracked me up, her comedy was genius, and she had such an upward trajectory. I thought she‚Äôd win. Truly. But now‚Äî bitch, you‚Äôre all star material henny. And also my personal fav of the season.

Lawrence Cheney:: Two words. Criminally hilarious. Like seriously, why is this bitch so casually funny in basically everything they say? No but, Lawrence clearly won the heart of Ru (and me) early on and was a clear front runner. I wasn‚Äôt surprised by her win at all. Deserved? Yes. Impressed? Yes. But did I kinda want Bimini to win? Also yes.

-

Final Thoughts:: Just wow. Yall weren‚Äôt lying when you said this season was top tier. The level of drag.. the stiffness of competition.. the gag worthy moments.. truly an incredible season. THIS IS WHAT DRAGRACE SHOULD BE EVERY SEASON. Chefs motherfuckin kiss.

Catch ya next season babes, no spoilers ü•Ç

We now have a romantic ace partner and I'm worried it will end our marriage if he doesn't figure it out.","Writing here because I love the podcast, and I'm fairly certain nobody else in the house listens, so it's less likely to be seen by my husband. The details are specific enough that if anybody who knows us sees this, they would know immediately üò¨. I'm sorry if I ramble a bit, but MAN do I need somebody to confirm I'm not crazy and commiserate a bit.

My (28 they/she) husband (30M) has always been in a closet made of glass. We got together before I had come out as bisexual and nonbinary, and others had told me they were surprised because they truly thought he was gay. Our early relationship was a whirlwind of a story on its own, as we had met in the military and had a courthouse wedding after 6 months to stay near each other with the understanding that we could easily divorce if things went south. We are now going on a decade together, nearing 9 years of marriage, and for all we have been through together and love each other I am still not convinced this man is as cishet as he thinks.

Now, my husband is a sweetheart, the kind of guy that women who are afraid of men actually feel safe with immediately. At parties I have described him as a bundle of light and gotten sage nods of agreement. We all also agree he's biromantic as hell and in denial.

The top evidence is as follows:

1) He has drunkenly made out with at least 3x as many guys as I have people. He says it's funny, says he's confident in his masculinity and sexuality, and especially does it to freak out homophobes into leaving the party. This was mostly in our early 20's when we were the party hosts.

2) When I came out as nonbinary, he helped me with the transition at every stage. When I wanted to shave my head, he held the shaver. When I wanted to wear more mens' clothes, he shared his (and was annoyed I wore them better). It was never a question of whether or not we'd stay together. I have jokingly told him this makes him an honorary bisexual, and he just shrugged and said he loves me for me.

3) We share types. When watching shows together, we will often discuss who's hottest, and he doesn't keep to women. I'm talking in-depth discussions about Lucifer or Alucard. We also overlap types with women. It's been fun, if a touch aggravating when he loops back to saying he's fully straight.

Life has happened, we have settled down a lot, built our village, have a kid (5 yr old) together, bought a house, etc. He's the love of my life and my best friend. I still cannot fathom him being fully straight.

Now, we had a roommate back when we very first got together (32M, let's call him John) who we both loved living with. Not only was John a genuinely nice guy, but he's the type that stress cleans and stress cooks, and we both reminisced over the years about coming home to the smell of pasta and banana bread and going into comfort mode for our friend. (On a side note, John and my husband regularly got confused as a couple, and me as a sister). We've stayed in touch, my husband and I worrying about the abusive on and off again ex that John struggled with, and discussing how much both of us missed the dynamic of living with him. So we decided to invite John to Thanksgiving and catch up. It turned out that John had since come out as ace and biromantic, was finally separated from the abusive ex, and also missed living with us.

On top of this, John and my autistic kid (then 3 and nonverbal) clicked immediately, something that was wildly rare to see. We would quickly find out John and I are also on the spectrum, as are many of our friends, and joke my ADHD husband likes to collect queer autistics.

After a few days of catching up, it came up that all three of us missed living together, housing is too expensive for John to live alone, he needs people, and everything felt right. We decided to give it a try and move John into our third bedroom, with a semi-platonic, semi-romantic relationship. We discussed boundaries, and were all on the same page: 
We all like to cuddle.
We all like to do small things for each other to show we care (think making coffee for each other, talking about our days, shoulder massages).
We all like to go out, be it to movies or dinner, and spend time together.

The trouble is that while John and I agree that it's a very straightforward romantic-but-nonsexual relationship between the three of us, my husband does not see any of that as romance. Cuddling, going out together, even a forehead kiss goodnight could be ""what the homies do"" to him. He refuses to accept that it's not just friendship+ (which is fair I guess?). This explains why he believes he is straight: he's heterosexual, and if he doesn't accept romantic sh*t as romance, then there's nothing to say otherwise.

After more than a year, John has become a third parent and a full partner, and we are buying a bigger house for all four of us. John and I are baffled by husband's insistence that there's no romance between them. Worse, the closer we all get, the more husband is having to confront his own feelings about it, and it feels as though he's just as likely to pull away altogether to avoid processing his own feelings as he is finally just admitting it.

We've even had moments where John was discussing attraction to a character and said ""straight men don't know what they're missing"" and my husband said ""they absolutely don't"". We are banging our heads on the wall trying to get this man past his emotional constipation and into that pink-purple-and-blue pride gear.

Meanwhile I am terrified. I love both of these idiots, and want both of them to be happy, but John is anxious about husband's unwillingness to talk it out (this also being a first for John since coming out), and husband is getting defensive, leaving me feeling like I can't be a fair partner to either of them.

Beyond which, it hurts sometimes that my husband is so insistent on being ""straight"", because it's allowed people to say he only sees me as a woman, and I will never be anything but. I worry if I get top surgery, or if I tried HRT for a short time to deepen my voice and be more androgynous, would there be a limit to his attraction? Would we just become friends and co-parents? Would I risk losing the love of my life for a relatively small piece of comfort when I'm okay with the social transition?

Part of me just wishes I could hit undo or load an old save. To go back where his denial was only a slight eye-roll annoyance at times, and I didn't feel anxiety for our marriage at every turn. Hell, part of me wished I was cishet myself and monogamous and allistic and *not me*. This man has seen me through sickness and health, cared for me while I recovered from a minor brain injury, pushed me to be a better version of myself, supported me in becoming a published author, loved me when I could barely love myself, and been an amazing dad to an amazingly smart kid (who was reading at 2 yrs old, and has finally started speaking). But now we also have John in our lives, and for the long run. There's no undo. There's only moving forward and figuring it out, and I can't figure out their feelings for them.

I'm exhausted. During all of this I'm also struggling with learning I may have both narcolepsy and either a connective tissue disorder or autoimmune disorder that is tearing apart my body with compiled injuries. I'm physically, emotionally, spiritually, metaphorically and literally, wildly exhausted. I'm trapped by a gov't that wants me disappeared on multiple levels, and trying to figure out if my kid will still have access to an education next year. Even a little piece of validation in my feelings would be huge.

TL:DR: I believe my husband is biromantic, but he hasn't separated romance vs sexuality. Even though we have an ace romantic partner, he still refuses to face his feelings and just keeps polishing the glass door of the closet. I'm at a complete loss.

I added him on Facebook, he reached me out and told me to add him on instagram then tried to call I ignored him then texted me via WhatsApp and said he has feelings, and quickly asked to meet. On social media He seemed confident and open, but I'm reserved and cautious.

During the date:
He showed up in traditional clothes, His body language was reserved and intense, He didn‚Äôt flirt overtly or joke excessively. Instead, he observed, asked deep questions, and was visibly nervous ‚Äî
He asked me to remove his necklace from his hand (weird test?), then gave a light high five.
He opened up fast‚Äîtalked about his ex-fianc√©e, culture, marriage, to much questions about my family, etc.
I stayed calm, didn‚Äôt overshare, and joked lightly but kept distance. 

At the end, he opend the car door silently didn‚Äôt make a flirty or casual goodbye, and reacted with internal conflict when i said ‚ÄúHave fun‚Äù ‚Äî no smooth line or exit joke. Just silence and tension. I said ‚ÄúHave fun,‚Äù and he just nodded quietly.

After the date:
I messaged him politely next day"" hi it was nice to meet you, thanks for the coffee!""‚Äîhe replied a day later with ""hi my pleasure.. see you again soon:)""
. Then he got quiet. I removed him from Instagram. He reacted on Facebook with symbolic stories and started posting old family pics + his pics with kids.
He never reached out again. But he still watches from afar‚Äîno messages.

My question:
Was this a case of love bombing then withdrawal? Or just a miscommunication because I was too composed? Cuz went on many dates but this one was different can‚Äôt get him out my mind for like 2 months :)",1,1748659576.0,AskMenRelationships,1,1.0,False

Ice Breakers. The moment I taste one, sharp and cold on my tongue, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre next to me again. That crisp sweetness, like the way you kiss me mid-sentence, like the way you smell when you lean in too close. I swear, they taste like you. Bright, cool, unforgettable. And just like you, they stay with me long after they‚Äôre gone.


Shoes make me think of you too, which sounds stupid unless you knew you once tied mine so tight I swore you were trying to keep me tethered to you. Maybe you were. Or maybe you were just trying to keep me grounded. It‚Äôs funny because you‚Äôre an electrician, so maybe that‚Äôs exactly what you were doing. Keeping me grounded to you. I didn‚Äôt untie them for hours. They left a mark, but so did you.


Then there‚Äôs your guitar. God, the way you play. Like the strings owe you something. Like the music is trying to confess what your mouth won‚Äôt say. Sometimes I just listen, because I swear I can hear your soul bleeding out through the chords. And every time, it hits me how lucky I am to know a boy who sings with his hands.


Your eyes are blue. Not dark blue, not storm blue, but glacier blue. They‚Äôve wrecked me gently a hundred times over. The color blue is ruined for me now, in the most beautiful way. I‚Äôll never see it without thinking of you.


The stars remind me of you. The moon too. You told me once that you love space, the mysteries behind it. And now every time I look up, I think of you. I make wishes on falling stars like they know who you are. Like they already agree.


The smell of coffee hits me like a freight train. Not just because you drink it, but because of those coffee-flavored nicotine pouches. The scent clings to your clothes and settles in my lungs like a second heartbeat. Coffee doesn‚Äôt just wake me up anymore. It makes me ache for you.


And pink flowers‚Ä¶ God, don‚Äôt even get me started on pink flowers. You picked one once. And not just a flower. A whole plant. Ripped the whole thing right from the garden box outside of an Outback Steakhouse on our first date. Flowers, roots, soil and all. You put it in a can so it wouldn‚Äôt get dirt in my car on the way home. I still have it. I treat it like a diamond.
I keep that memory pressed between the pages of my mind like it‚Äôll die if I let it breathe.

All of it‚Ä¶ mints, shoes, guitars, colors, stars, flowers‚Ä¶ none of it means anything on its own. But together? They form this soft mosaic of what you are to me. And saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù feels like such a lie. It‚Äôs too small. Too shallow.


I don‚Äôt love you. I exist because of you. I inhale reminders of you like oxygen. I carry you in every sense, every breath, every beat.
Love is just the beginning.


You‚Äôre the reason even ice-cold mints feel like warmth.

I was hoping for anyone to share any tips or success stories on lifestyle/dietary changes that made a significant change for them. I lost my health insurance and now the costs for dermatology/medications is too much for me (which initially helped), and I've spent probably thousands on skin care products. I've finally gotten the dryness under control, but there is nothing that has brought down the inflammation or pustules. Basically I am desperate for any non-expensive changes I can make in my life that *might* give me a chance at clearing my face.

Alcohol and spicy foods seem to be my main triggers, although my face is constantly red at baseline. For the changes I've tried to make, I can go months without drinking alcohol, I've gone weeks without adding any spice to my food, and I drink iced coffee without any sugar or creamer. But overall my diet is awful and I am pretty inconsistent with exercise. I was thinking about doing a 30 day 'cleanse', but I was hoping for some tips on what I should prioritize including in my diet, if there are any supplements that work, or if anyone has actually seen progress with just lifestyle changes.

But I feel like I‚Äôm settling for him. How do I not blindside him if I leave him?,"So this is going to be a long one so I'm sorry about this. 
TL;DR: Been engaged to a great guy and we've been together over 8.5 years. But I'm having second thoughts and am considering leaving. But I'm worried about blindsiding him and ruining his birthday which is coming up soon. 

Here's some background information. I (31F) have been in a relationship with my fianc√© (37M) for 8.5 years. We were official since the tail end of November 2016. Anyway, he is a great and wonderful man. He treats me like such a queen here. He is very nice, kind, and such a gentleman. He is also very romantic and such a gentleman. Like he will always walk me to my ride whenever we go out on dates if I have a ride bring me to see him, and he always pulls a chair out for me. Hell, he even did that on our first date, and he even read me a cute poem on that same first date as well which made me swoon. He also always does things like tell me to get home safely, give me thoughtful gifts such as jewelry, a few stuffed animals, flowers, chocolates and even some little souvenirs whenever he went on trips (and I think he even gave me some little crafts he made when he went to this camp for adults too. He even gave me his late grandmother's bracelet and a couple old t-shirts of his) when expected like on birthdays, holidays, etc. Even give me gifts just because. He is also very supportive and physically affectionate too. He is also a very supportive guy. And he tells me he loves me every day. And this is a big one; he was also willing to take it slow and never pushed me for sex. He seems like a dream man and a lot of women would kill to have a man like him. 

Now here is where I'm having doubts and thinking about breaking up. He ALWAYS wants and expects my mother to come pick him up with her car to drive us to dates and even to my house occasionally, if we're not meeting up at the coffee and donut place across from his house or the pizza place or bagel place that's on the same street. Now, he cannot drive due to a disability which I don't have a problem with.  (I also am unable to drive due to me being blind in one eye.) But he never wants to make an effort to use his own transportation. I suggested that he use the public bus but he says his uncle won't let him go on his own and it bothers me so much. He also won't take the public bus to my town because it takes around 3  hours to get from his house to mine which is fair.

However, I know he could use the para transit bus services for disabled people to go around to different places and they'd drop him off and pick him up from his house as opposed to going to a bus stop. And he did but I notice he stopped after we became official. I tried talking to him about it but he says they're too expensive since they're a little more expensive than the public buses and he says they don't go to my city since we live in different counties. He also has staff and a driver (It's probably a special driver that brings disabled people to places that a caseworker gave him) but only uses it to go to the gym and other places in his town since he says he can use it only twice a week. I've tried getting him to use this to see me but it rarely ever happened. 

Also, he NEVER brought me to meet his family and I only met his friends a few times. The only time I even saw his family was at his grandmother's wake last year and it grinds my gears. He goes over to his aunt's house for Christmas and a lot of the times for Easter too but he just never offered to invite me or my mother. He always says maybe next year or someday but that day never came. What also bothered me was that he went to cape cod in October for a weekend with family but never bothered to invite me over. Also, he went to North Carolina on a road trip with his family but again, never bothered to invite me and has said maybe next time. Of course, next time never came. 


Another thing that bothers me is  that we still never moved in together and he never even discussed us getting a place together (he still lives with his uncle and aunt. His grandmother also lived with him until her death last year.) Yes, there are ""living apart together"" arrangements for couples, but those couples pretty much always can WALK to each others houses unlike me and my fianc√© where our houses are still a 30 minute drive from each other in different counties. He seems to want to live in his current apartment complex forever but I would not want to live there as I'm just not a fan of it. I would like it if we lived apart but our places would be near MY complex! Or we could have our own apartments in a different complex in a different city. 

Also, he never really seemed to want me to come over HIS place! I only came over ONCE, and that was when we were not official yet when we were waiting for his para transit bus to bring us to his workplace Halloween party. I brought this up with him many times but he always seems to have an excuse. 

Some other things that have bothered me were when a few years ago in spring of 2021, he texted me and said that he didn't want me to be friends with one of my very good friends from college anymore because she blocked him and of course I said I was not gonna do that and he got upset. Also, a year later he apparently became friends with my college friend's ex who cheated on him and he told me to tell her not to worry about it. But I knew that I would have been a bad friend for doing that. And he got upset about it too. But he let it go and this kind of thing rarely happened. In fact, it never happened before our engagement which happened around our 4 year anniversary. 

Also, we both used to want children one day but I changed my mind these past couple years when I realized that motherhood just isn't for me. 

He also said a couple times that he wanted to make his ex gf jealous but I think he was probably just joking. Which still rarely happened.But it still bothered me. Also, I didn't notice until we became official that he started talking to me just three months after his breakup with his ex. Which I feel so stupid about. And we became official just another 3 months after that. 

Also, he NEVER used a debit or credit card and only ever used cash to buy stuff. Needless to say he has no bank account. Like we need to have bank accounts to basically survive and thrive these days. If he ever wants to buy something with a card, he always wants to use gift cards rather than a bank account. 

Also, we never really had any sex until a few years into the relationship. Like it wasn't until I got engaged that I gave him a hand job for the first time and it wasn't until the end of 2021 when we had sex. I don't know what happened. And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me. Also, I am scared, not of being alone but of never finding another man that's as amazing as him. I've read and heard that the dating scene these days is crap. And I had pretty much no luck getting a boyfriend before him. He was pretty much my first boyfriend and I was 22, almost 23 when we became ""official"". Before I met him, I never had a guy I like that would like me back that would also want a relationship. And I didn't even go on my first date till I was 21. I was on the apps such as tinder and plenty of fish in the year or so before meeting my fianc√© and it was a crapshoot. Like I went on a couple dates that went nowhere and even dealt with a few men who just wanted casual sex. Also, I do not meet conventional beauty standards and I am one of those ""fat chicks"" which is why I think it took me until my early 20s to have my first boyfriend, date and first kiss too.

I am also worried about how my fianc√© will react if I do break up with him. I am worried that he will be really devastated and never recover. And that he will hate me and never forgive me. I am also worried that his friends will hate me too. And I'm also worried that I will ruin his birthday if I do it before a month and a half from now because his birthday is on July 2. Which will be just one month and a few days from now. He is a good man and I don't want him to cry over me on his birthday. Also, several months back, he made me promise to never break up with him and I promised him I would never want to leave and me saying that just makes me feel trapped. Breaking a promise makes someone a horrible person and I don't want to be a horrible monster to someone who genuinely cares for me. 

Also, here's where I'm worried about blindsiding him if I leave tomorrow or Sunday or even on Monday. He does not see a breakup coming and he thinks we will be together forever. I did tell him and give him hints on things that are bothering me but I feel that I was not clear enough or aggressive enough. Ugh. I don't want to blindside him because I've heard that blindsiding someone is very cruel and my fianc√© is a very nice man who doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. I would also want us to be on good terms if we do break up and I'm afraid that we won't be and that all hell will break loose. I was always afraid of going through a breakup, especially a really nasty one. What do I do here? How do I move forward? Or maybe I have ""grass is greener"" syndrome and I should stay with him forever and just possibly live with what's bothering me. I mean, he was never abusive or toxic at all. And he was ALWAYS loyal too. Ugh, I just don't know what to do here. And how to not come across as an asshole no matter what I may decide. ",0,1748658836.0,Advice,5,0.33,False

1kzmaj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kzmaj6/been_engaged_to_my_wonderful_fianc√©_for_over_85/,Been engaged to my WONDERFUL fianc√© for over 8.5 years. But I feel like I‚Äôm settling for him. How do I not blindside him if I leave him?,"So this is going to be a long one so I'm sorry about this. Here's some background information. I (31F) have been in a relationship with my fianc√© (37M) for 8.5 years. We were official since the tail end of November 2016. Anyway, he is a great and wonderful man. He treats me like such a queen here. He is very nice, kind, and such a gentleman. He is also very romantic and such a gentleman. Like he will always walk me to my ride whenever we go out on dates if I have a ride bring me to see him, and he always pulls a chair out for me. Hell, he even did that on our first date, and he even read me a cute poem on that same first date as well which made me swoon. He also always does things like tell me to get home safely, give me thoughtful gifts such as jewelry, a few stuffed animals, flowers, chocolates and even some little souvenirs whenever he went on trips (and I think he even gave me some little crafts he made when he went to this camp for adults too. He even gave me his late grandmother's bracelet and a couple old t-shirts of his) when expected like on birthdays, holidays, etc. Even give me gifts just because. He is also very supportive and physically affectionate too. He is also a very supportive guy. And he tells me he loves me every day. And this is a big one; he was also willing to take it slow and never pushed me for sex. He seems like a dream man and a lot of women would kill to have a man like him. 

Now here is where I'm having doubts and thinking about breaking up. He ALWAYS wants and expects my mother to come pick him up with her car to drive us to dates and even to my house occasionally, if we're not meeting up at the coffee and donut place across from his house or the pizza place or bagel place that's on the same street. Now, he cannot drive due to a disability which I don't have a problem with.  (I also am unable to drive due to me being blind in one eye.) But he never wants to make an effort to use his own transportation. I suggested that he use the public bus but he says his uncle won't let him go on his own and it bothers me so much. He also won't take the public bus to my town because it takes around 3  hours to get from his house to mine which is fair.

However, I know he could use the para transit bus services for disabled people to go around to different places and they'd drop him off and pick him up from his house as opposed to going to a bus stop. And he did but I notice he stopped after we became official. I tried talking to him about it but he says they're too expensive since they're a little more expensive than the public buses and he says they don't go to my city since we live in different counties. He also has staff and a driver (It's probably a special driver that brings disabled people to places that a caseworker gave him) but only uses it to go to the gym and other places in his town since he says he can use it only twice a week. I've tried getting him to use this to see me but it rarely ever happened. 

Also, he NEVER brought me to meet his family and I only met his friends a few times. The only time I even saw his family was at his grandmother's wake last year and it grinds my gears. He goes over to his aunt's house for Christmas and a lot of the times for Easter too but he just never offered to invite me or my mother. He always says maybe next year or someday but that day never came. What also bothered me was that he went to cape cod in October for a weekend with family but never bothered to invite me over. Also, he went to North Carolina on a road trip with his family but again, never bothered to invite me and has said maybe next time. Of course, next time never came. 


Another thing that bothers me is  that we still never moved in together and he never even discussed us getting a place together (he still lives with his uncle and aunt. His grandmother also lived with him until her death last year.) Yes, there are ""living apart together"" arrangements for couples, but those couples pretty much always can WALK to each others houses unlike me and my fianc√© where our houses are still a 30 minute drive from each other in different counties. He seems to want to live in his current apartment complex forever but I would not want to live there as I'm just not a fan of it. I would like it if we lived apart but our places would be near MY complex! Or we could have our own apartments in a different complex in a different city. 

Also, he never really seemed to want me to come over HIS place! I only came over ONCE, and that was when we were not official yet when we were waiting for his para transit bus to bring us to his workplace Halloween party. I brought this up with him many times but he always seems to have an excuse. 

Some other things that have bothered me were when a few years ago in spring of 2021, he texted me and said that he didn't want me to be friends with one of my very good friends from college anymore because she blocked him and of course I said I was not gonna do that and he got upset. Also, a year later he apparently became friends with my college friend's ex who cheated on him and he told me to tell her not to worry about it. But I knew that I would have been a bad friend for doing that. And he got upset about it too. But he let it go and this kind of thing rarely happened. In fact, it never happened before our engagement which happened around our 4 year anniversary. 

Also, we both used to want children one day but I changed my mind these past couple years when I realized that motherhood just isn't for me. 

He also said a couple times that he wanted to make his ex gf jealous but I think he was probably just joking. Which still rarely happened.But it still bothered me. Also, I didn't notice until we became official that he started talking to me just three months after his breakup with his ex. Which I feel so stupid about. And we became official just another 3 months after that. 

Also, he NEVER used a debit or credit card and only ever used cash to buy stuff. Needless to say he has no bank account. Like we need to have bank accounts to basically survive and thrive these days. If he ever wants to buy something with a card, he always wants to use gift cards rather than a bank account. 

Also, we never really had any sex until a few years into the relationship. Like it wasn't until I got engaged that I gave him a hand job for the first time and it wasn't until the end of 2021 when we had sex. I don't know what happened. And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me. Also, I am scared, not of being alone but of never finding another man that's as amazing as him. I've read and heard that the dating scene these days is crap. And I had pretty much no luck getting a boyfriend before him. He was pretty much my first boyfriend and I was 22, almost 23 when we became ""official"". Before I met him, I never had a guy I like that would like me back that would also want a relationship. And I didn't even go on my first date till I was 21. I was on the apps such as tinder and plenty of fish in the year or so before meeting my fianc√© and it was a crapshoot. Like I went on a couple dates that went nowhere and even dealt with a few men who just wanted casual sex. Also, I do not meet conventional beauty standards and I am one of those ""fat chicks"" which is why I think it took me until my early 20s to have my first boyfriend, date and first kiss too.

I am also worried about how my fianc√© will react if I do break up with him. I am worried that he will be really devastated and never recover. And that he will hate me and never forgive me. I am also worried that his friends will hate me too. And I'm also worried that I will ruin his birthday if I do it before a month and a half from now because his birthday is on July 2. Which will be just one month and a few days from now. He is a good man and I don't want him to cry over me on his birthday. Also, several months back, he made me promise to never break up with him and I promised him I would never want to leave and me saying that just makes me feel trapped. Breaking a promise makes someone a horrible person and I don't want to be a horrible monster to someone who genuinely cares for me. 

Also, here's where I'm worried about blindsiding him if I leave tomorrow or Sunday or even on Monday. He does not see a breakup coming and he thinks we will be together forever. I did tell him and give him hints on things that are bothering me but I feel that I was not clear enough or aggressive enough. Ugh. I don't want to blindside him because I've heard that blindsiding someone is very cruel and my fianc√© is a very nice man who doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. I would also want us to be on good terms if we do break up and I'm afraid that we won't be and that all hell will break loose. I was always afraid of going through a breakup, especially a really nasty one. What do I do here? How do I move forward? Or maybe I have ""grass is greener"" syndrome and I should stay with him forever and just possibly live with what's bothering me. I mean, he was never abusive or toxic at all. And he was ALWAYS loyal too. Ugh, I just don't know what to do here. And how to not come across as an asshole no matter what I may decide. ",2,1748658401.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Same barista almost every day friendly, funny, always remembered my order. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt look forward to seeing her smile in the mornings.

Today, I don‚Äôt know what got into me. Maybe it was the weather, maybe I finally got tired of wondering what if  but as she handed me my drink, I just kind of blurted it out. Asked her if she‚Äôd be okay sharing her number.

She paused for a second, smiled, and said ‚Äúone sec.‚Äù Then she ran to the back, came back with a card, and handed it to me. I said thank you and walked out feeling like I just unlocked a new level in life.

Later that night, after work, I texted her:
""Hey, it‚Äôs [name]. Thanks for giving me your number. How was your day?""

Waited. Nothing.
Slept on it. Still nothing.
Weekend came and went and yeah. Turns out it was a fake number.

I won‚Äôt lie that one stung. But hey, no anger here. I‚Äôve worked in retail, I get it. People have their boundaries, and sometimes giving a fake number feels like the safest exit. I tossed the card and made peace with it.

And yes I‚Äôm still gonna go back for coffee. It‚Äôs a great shop, and life‚Äôs too short to let one awkward moment ruin your routine. No hard feelings, no weird vibes. I‚Äôll keep it classy, keep it friendly, and keep sipping my coffee in peace.

I was stoked when I heard about the engagement and couldn‚Äôt wait to attend. I called my friend to congratulate her (after two years of not speaking due to life and nothing negative), and after an hour of catching up and a few laughs we said goodbye on a happy note.

A week later I get the lecture of a life time from my aunt (mom of cousin) for how ungrateful I am and how it is so inappropriate to make jokes about my family members to other people. I made a joke to my friend about how my cousin always used to have really nice sunglasses as a kid but always used to loose them soon after he bought them, how he is known liking fast vehicles and for having great tastes for scotch and coffee and hopefully she does too. Apparently my cousin was in the back ground and heard part of the call and he told his mom about it.

I was devastated and in tears after the call with my aunt. I wrote my cousin an apology right away and never heard back.

We just got the invite to the wedding and we found out my husband can‚Äôt get the weekend off of work (not enough notice since the date wasn‚Äôt picked for awhile). I now live out of state and it would cost a small fortune for my family to travel to the wedding (if my husband were to call into work). I have a 3y and 1y old and don‚Äôt want to fly with both alone. I don‚Äôt believe I would have the best time visiting that side of the family either since my parents are now divorced and my sister isn‚Äôt involved with that side of the family anymore, plus that side of the family has never made a trip out to meet my kids, and they misspelled my husband‚Äôs name on the invite so it doesn‚Äôt seem like they really care about us. But my aunt is acting like it is the end of the world if we don‚Äôt come and talking very negatively about us to everyone because of it.

He also won't take the public bus to my town because it takes around 3  hours to get from his house to mine which is fair.

However, I know he could use the para transit bus services for disabled people to go around to different places and they'd drop him off and pick him up from his house as opposed to going to a bus stop. And he did but I notice he stopped after we became official. I tried talking to him about it but he says they're too expensive since they're a little more expensive than the public buses and he says they don't go to my city since we live in different counties. He also has staff and a driver (It's probably a special driver that brings disabled people to places that a caseworker gave him) but only uses it to go to the gym and other places in his town since he says he can use it only twice a week. I've tried getting him to use this to see me but it rarely ever happened. 

Also, he NEVER brought me to meet his family and I only met his friends a few times. The only time I even saw his family was at his grandmother's wake last year and it grinds my gears. He goes over to his aunt's house for Christmas and a lot of the times for Easter too but he just never offered to invite me or my mother. He always says maybe next year or someday but that day never came. What also bothered me was that he went to cape cod in October for a weekend with family but never bothered to invite me over. Also, he went to North Carolina on a road trip with his family but again, never bothered to invite me and has said maybe next time. Of course, next time never came. 


Another thing that bothers me is  that we still never moved in together and he never even discussed us getting a place together (he still lives with his uncle and aunt. His grandmother also lived with him until her death last year.) Yes, there are ""living apart together"" arrangements for couples, but those couples pretty much always can WALK to each others houses unlike me and my fianc√© where our houses are still a 30 minute drive from each other in different counties. He seems to want to live in his current apartment complex forever but I would not want to live there as I'm just not a fan of it. I would like it if we lived apart but our places would be near MY complex! Or we could have our own apartments in a different complex in a different city. 

Also, he never really seemed to want me to come over HIS place! I only came over ONCE, and that was when we were not official yet when we were waiting for his para transit bus to bring us to his workplace Halloween party. I brought this up with him many times but he always seems to have an excuse. 

Some other things that have bothered me were when a few years ago in spring of 2021, he texted me and said that he didn't want me to be friends with one of my very good friends from college anymore because she blocked him and of course I said I was not gonna do that and he got upset. Also, a year later he apparently became friends with my college friend's ex who cheated on him and he told me to tell her not to worry about it. But I knew that I would have been a bad friend for doing that. And he got upset about it too. But he let it go and this kind of thing rarely happened. In fact, it never happened before our engagement which happened around our 4 year anniversary. 

Also, we both used to want children one day but I changed my mind these past couple years when I realized that motherhood just isn't for me. 

He also said a couple times that he wanted to make his ex gf jealous but I think he was probably just joking. Which still rarely happened.But it still bothered me. Also, I didn't notice until we became official that he started talking to me just three months after his breakup with his ex. Which I feel so stupid about. And we became official just another 3 months after that. 

Also, he NEVER used a debit or credit card and only ever used cash to buy stuff. Needless to say he has no bank account. Like we need to have bank accounts to basically survive and thrive these days. If he ever wants to buy something with a card, he always wants to use gift cards rather than a bank account. 

Also, we never really had any sex until a few years into the relationship. Like it wasn't until I got engaged that I gave him a hand job for the first time and it wasn't until the end of 2021 when we had sex. I don't know what happened. And we didn't really have full on intercourse till summer of 2022.  I guess I just didn't initiate anything and waited for him to do so. 

Look, I know these things I listed may sound like yellow or red flags but he also has a chock full of GREEN flags too! He comforted me when I was stressed with stuff such as schoolwork and when my old cat passed away in 2022. He also really adores me and is crazy about me. Also, I am scared, not of being alone but of never finding another man that's as amazing as him. I've read and heard that the dating scene these days is crap. And I had pretty much no luck getting a boyfriend before him. He was pretty much my first boyfriend and I was 22, almost 23 when we became ""official"". Before I met him, I never had a guy I like that would like me back that would also want a relationship. And I didn't even go on my first date till I was 21. I was on the apps such as tinder and plenty of fish in the year or so before meeting my fianc√© and it was a crapshoot. Like I went on a couple dates that went nowhere and even dealt with a few men who just wanted casual sex. Also, I do not meet conventional beauty standards and I am one of those ""fat chicks"" which is why I think it took me until my early 20s to have my first boyfriend, date and first kiss too.

I am also worried about how my fianc√© will react if I do break up with him. I am worried that he will be really devastated and never recover. And that he will hate me and never forgive me. I am also worried that his friends will hate me too. And I'm also worried that I will ruin his birthday if I do it before a month and a half from now because his birthday is on July 2. Which will be just one month and a few days from now. He is a good man and I don't want him to cry over me on his birthday. Also, several months back, he made me promise to never break up with him and I promised him I would never want to leave and me saying that just makes me feel trapped. Breaking a promise makes someone a horrible person and I don't want to be a horrible monster to someone who genuinely cares for me. 

Also, here's where I'm worried about blindsiding him if I leave tomorrow or Sunday or even on Monday. He does not see a breakup coming and he thinks we will be together forever. I did tell him and give him hints on things that are bothering me but I feel that I was not clear enough or aggressive enough. Ugh. I don't want to blindside him because I've heard that blindsiding someone is very cruel and my fianc√© is a very nice man who doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. I would also want us to be on good terms if we do break up and I'm afraid that we won't be and that all hell will break loose. I was always afraid of going through a breakup, especially a really nasty one. What do I do here? How do I move forward? Or maybe I have ""grass is greener"" syndrome and I should stay with him forever and just possibly live with what's bothering me. I mean, he was never abusive or toxic at all. And he was ALWAYS loyal too. Ugh, I just don't know what to do here. And how to not come across as an asshole no matter what I may decide. So will I be overreacting if I do think about leaving?

My wife and I recently became parents, and like many of you, we dove headfirst into the world of baby products. In the process, we bought three strollers (yes, three!) and over ten baby bottles‚Äîthough my wife insists it was definitely more than ten.

We quickly realized how hard it was to find product recommendations we could actually trust. So much of what‚Äôs out there is driven by affiliate links and sponsored content, and it‚Äôs rarely tailored to what your family actually needs.

That‚Äôs why we built bbsaver.com.

bbsaver is not trying to be the ultimate baby product site. It‚Äôs a simple, fair, and honest tool to help new parents compare baby gear based on their unique situation‚Äînot what‚Äôs trending or what earns a commission.

There are no ads, no affiliate links, and no sponsored posts. Just straight-up, personalized comparisons based on what‚Äôs important to your family.

We‚Äôd love for you to check it out and let us know what you think. And as two coders who‚Äôve gone through the parenting fire, we‚Äôre always looking for ways to help other new parents. If you have ideas, problems tech could solve, or feedback of any kind‚Äîwe‚Äôre all ears.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern buggy cup holder is far more than just a place to set your drink. Advanced models incorporate thoughtful design elements to enhance stability and user experience.**Adjustable Clamp:** A robust and adjustable clamp is crucial for securely attaching the cup holder to various buggy frames. The best models feature a clamp that can accommodate a wide range of handlebar diameters, typically from 0.6 inches to 1.7 inches.These clamps are often made from durable ABS plastic or composite materials, ensuring longevity and resistance to cracking or breaking under stress. Adjustability is often achieved through a simple, tool-free design involving a tightening knob or lever.

A properly designed clamp will distribute pressure evenly, preventing damage to the buggy frame's finish. Moreover, look for clamps that incorporate a non-slip material, such as rubber or silicone, to further enhance grip and prevent rotation during use. This is especially meaningful when navigating uneven terrain.

**Cup holder Diameter & Depth:** The internal diameter and depth of the cup holder are critical for accommodating a variety of beverage containers. Ideally,the cup holder should accommodate standard-sized cups,bottles,and even larger travel mugs,typically ranging from 2.5 inches to 3.75 inches in diameter. Depth is equally important, as a deeper holder, generally between 3 and 4 inches, provides greater stability and reduces the risk of spills.

Adjustable features, such as internal supports or flexible rims, can further enhance the cup holder's versatility, allowing it to securely hold smaller or irregularly shaped containers. Consider models with a conical shape, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, as this design tends to provide more stability for various container sizes.

**Rotation & Angle Adjustment:** The ability to rotate and adjust the angle of the cup holder is a valuable feature, allowing users to optimize its position for easy access and to prevent spills on inclines. Many cup holders offer 360-degree rotation,enabling users to position the holder in the most convenient and accessible location,regardless of the buggy frame's configuration.

Angle adjustment is particularly useful when navigating hills or uneven surfaces. The ability to tilt the cup holder slightly can help to keep the beverage upright, minimizing the risk of spills. This feature frequently enough involves a simple locking mechanism that allows the user to secure the desired angle.

**Material Quality & Durability:** The quality of materials used in a buggy cup holder directly impacts its durability and longevity. Look for models constructed from robust materials such as ABS plastic, polypropylene, or stainless steel.These materials offer excellent resistance to impacts, temperature fluctuations, and UV exposure, ensuring that the cup holder can withstand the rigors of daily use.Furthermore, consider the quality of the fasteners and hinges used in the cup holder's construction. Stainless steel hardware is preferable, as it is resistant to corrosion and provides a secure and long-lasting connection. A well-constructed cup holder should be able to withstand repeated use without showing signs of wear or degradation.

**Easy Installation and Removal:** A user-pleasant installation process is essential for any buggy cup holder. The best models utilize a tool-free design, allowing for quick and easy attachment and removal without the need for screwdrivers or other specialized tools.Typically, this involves a simple clamp mechanism that can be tightened or loosened by hand.

Consider models that feature a quick-release mechanism, allowing for easy removal of the cup holder when folding the buggy or storing it in a compact space. This feature is particularly useful for parents who frequently travel or use public transportation. The overall design should be intuitive and straightforward, requiring minimal effort to install and remove the cup holder.

## Core Benefits

A well-designed buggy cup holder provides numerous benefits, enhancing convenience and safety during outings with young children.

**Improved Convenience:** Having a readily accessible cup holder on your buggy significantly improves convenience, allowing you to keep your beverage within easy reach while pushing the stroller. This frees up your hands, making it easier to attend to your child's needs or manage other tasks.For example, if you're juggling a diaper bag, a phone, and a fussy baby, having a secure and accessible cup holder allows you to quickly grab a drink of water without having to stop and rummage through your belongings.

**Enhanced Safety:** A secure cup holder reduces the risk of spills, which can be both messy and potentially hazardous.Spilled hot beverages can cause burns, while slippery surfaces can create trip hazards. By providing a stable and secure platform for your drink, a good cup holder minimizes the likelihood of accidents. For instance, imagine navigating a crowded sidewalk with a hot coffee; a secure cup holder will prevent accidental spills that could harm you, your child, or other pedestrians.

**Better Association:** A cup holder can also contribute to better organization by providing a designated space for your drink, preventing it from cluttering up the stroller basket or other storage areas. This allows you to keep essential items like diapers, snacks, and toys readily accessible. For example, instead of balancing your water bottle precariously on top of the diaper bag, you can keep it securely in the cup holder, freeing up space in the basket for other necessities.

**Increased Enjoyment of Outings:** By providing a convenient and safe way to carry your beverage, a good cup holder can make your outings with your child more enjoyable. it allows you to stay hydrated and refreshed without having to constantly worry about spills or juggling multiple items. As an example, on a hot summer day, having a readily accessible cold drink can significantly improve your comfort and overall experience while pushing the stroller through the park.

1kzlza4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kzlza4/i_24f_got_dumped_by_my_ex_21f_shes_not_a_bad/,"I (24F) got dumped by my ex (21F). She‚Äôs not a bad person, I just can‚Äôt stand how she treated me","About a month ago, I received a FaceTime call from my long-distance girlfriend saying she didn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore. 

Yes, I go to therapy, and I‚Äôve vented to friends about how angry it makes me to think about how she treated me. I‚Äôve been advised to find distractions through hobbies, but since I‚Äôve got nothing really planned for the summer, I‚Äôm spending too much of my time and energy to think about her, and how much fun she‚Äôll have than me this summer.

We started dating April 2024. It was my final year of college, but she would stay there and continue her studies after I graduated in May. 
I had to move to a new city for a job, and I was living a few hours away from the college we went to. On average, I saw her 1-3 times a month. 
However, her family lived an hour away from me, and would host a family dinner once a month that we would both go to. (She had siblings that were also in college/living elsewhere). Afterwards, my girlfriend would drive back homr with, and we'd spend the weekend together.

When we first started dating over the summer, I was very happy with the communication. We would FaceTime everyday, but once she returned to school, the communication got so bad, that we weren‚Äôt even talking everyday, just sending snaps.

I had expressed to her how unhappy I was with our communication, but it was always the same reasoning. She couldn‚Äôt talk to me because she was busy with classes, or hanging out with her friends. I started to get irritated because she would hang out with the same group of people at the same time everyday (for hours into the night) but couldn‚Äôt step away to call me? 

Around November, we stopped calling completely and would barely text. (I was always the one who would send the first text). 
There were several times I would text her, and she would leave me on read. It was a big deal to me because we were barely talking, and to be left on read made me feel like I was bothering her. She assured me I really wasn‚Äôt bothering her, and that she was just busy. She actually said that she would see my texts and forget to respond because she would get distracted by her friends talking to her(?) 
There were a couple times she wouldn‚Äôt respond to my text for an entire day until I sent a follow-up message. 

I started to feel like I was going crazy, that I wasn‚Äôt being understanding of how busy she was. As a college student, I was playing in ensembles, leading a sorority, and working part-time, so I understood the pressure of it all. But if I had a girlfriend, I would have always prioritized her.

When I would visit my girlfriend at college, I noticed she was way more talkative with her friends than me. There were times I would be a little disappointed, because her friends knew more of what was going on in her life than I did. I felt like I was always the last to know.

At the beginning of 2025, I became more vocal about how unhappy I was. She even got angry with me when I asked if she was getting my snapchat/ text notifications, because she had been constantly reminding me that she was just busy. There was a point where I just gave up trying to fix the communication. Anytime I would bring it up she just got annoyed. 

A pivotal moment for me was in February 2025, when she admitted that she would see a text from me and not respond. She said verbatim: ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt have time to deal with that right now.‚Äù 

Or another moment, when I told her I wanted to talk to her once a day on the phone, and she replied ‚ÄúWell, I think 1-2 times a week is fine.‚Äù

The first weekend of April 2025, she spent the weekend with me to celebrate our anniversary. I bought her flowers and a card, and they had been sitting on my kitchen counter. Not once during that weekend did she open my anniversary card.

I could tell something was off, because there was no cuddling, hardly any talking on her end, and completely no affection. I remember on the first night of our anniversary weekend, we got into bed, and she just flipped off the lights and said nothing.

I even made her breakfast, and bought her coffee. We went out to the mall and movies, but she barely spoke to me. When we got back to my place, she sat in silence on my couch, watching TikTok and playing games on her phone. She could tell I was upset, and to make it up to me, got us dinner and we watched movies for the rest of the night. Things felt better, like how they used to be when we would spend time together. 

(It was so odd, when we were together in our relationship, everything felt fine. The only issue was our long-distance communication.)

About a week after our anniversary, she FaceTimes me. She admitted that during our anniversary weekend, she had actually planned on dumping me. (Hence is why she was acting so stand-offish and having no drive to show affection). She said the main reasons were because: 

1.) She  didn‚Äôt like the way I interacted with her family. I had always been shy around them 

2.) She couldn‚Äôt stand not being able to touch me everyday. She was starting to not like the idea of being with someone she couldn‚Äôt see or touch everyday, because she was  ‚Äújust a touchy person‚Äù.

She said she wanted to give our relationship another shot, but this time, to really step up our communication. Apparently during our anniversary weekend, she was 80% sure of dumping me. That night she had flipped over without saying goodnight to me because she was on the verge of tears at the thought of dumping me. She admitted she had cried herself to sleep that night, and when she left my house to drive back to college. 

Although everything began to add up, I felt relieved, but also frustrated and confused. I had been trying to tell her for months that communication was the problem. She assured me that she wasn‚Äôt going to string me along, and genuinely wanted us to fix things. She even said she was excited for our future. 

From early April, We start calling/face timing every day. Things felt better. I even visited her at college for Easter weekend. We got drunk with her friends, she kissed all over me, and even hugged me and told me she loved me so much.
That weekend I went to her family‚Äôs Easter dinner, but I noticed she was almost avoiding me. I believe I exchanged more with dialogue with her family members than her. But when we‚Äôd talk at the event, she seemed okay. Her mom made us Easter baskets, and I finally started to feel like I was bonding with the family and coming out of my shell.

I had no idea that would be the last time I would see her or her family again. 

One week later, I noticed she‚Äôs not responding to my texts. I called her the Monday after Easter, and when she hung up, she didn‚Äôt tell me she loved me. I asked her if everything was okay, and she texted me ‚ÄúYes! I love you!‚Äù

She broke up with me the following Wednesday. That day I noticed she was very active on Snapchat, but not answering my texts or opening my snaps. And suddenly something in my mind just snapped. I realized I would actually be okay if we just broke up. I was so done with the lack of communication, a break-up felt needed.

Wednesday evening is when I got a Face Time call, and as you would expect, she finally dumped me (for real this time). I don‚Äôt know if she was just nervous, but she kept smiling and even looked like she laughed once. She didn‚Äôt seem sad or serious at all. She told me she was breaking up with me because she didn‚Äôt want to be with me. Also, because we didn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äùmorals‚Äù (what she really meant was that I had become very career-driven, while she just wanted to be a band director). Maybe she didn‚Äôt like that I had tried sports-bettings? She also said we just became different people. 

I was in shock, and when I started crying, so did she. I told her I would never think ill of her, but now I think I do. I don‚Äôt want her to be an evil ex, and I want us to one day be amicable,  but it‚Äôs hard when I reflect on how she treated me. Even towards the end when we were together, she would act so annoyed around me.

There were several other things that I, as well as my friends, found to be red flags. It felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her sexuality.  She had mentioned she wished she was straight if she had a choice, and that she didn‚Äôt like being lesbian. We also have a mutual guy friend (20M), who had said years ago (before me and my girlfriend started dating) that if she weren‚Äôt gay, he would have dated her. I jokingly brought it up to my girlfriend while sitting on the couch, and she said ‚Äúwell if I were straight, I‚Äôd probably date (20M) too!‚Äù
I had always been a little suspicious of that as well, and made me especially insecure because he was in her friend group. However, he does have a girlfriend who he has been with for a year, and he is crazy about her. He is also very respectful and supportive towards me and my girlfriend‚Äôs past relationship. (He was very shocked when she dumped me, and checked on me often, so don‚Äôt get the wrong idea that he may be a surprise villain.)

Recently, what has made me most angry is that 20M mutual friend of ours was surprised when I told him my girlfriend would barely speak around me when we were together. He said verbatim, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs surprising‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs talkative around our friend group all the time.‚Äù

I feel like the dumbass. I am not even sure if she loved me. The first time she almost dumped me, I had asked her why she still told me she loved me when leaving me on our anniversary weekend. She told me that even if we we did break up, that wouldn‚Äôt mean those feelings wouldn‚Äôt be true. 
My friends think she did love me, but didn‚Äôt know how to show it. She really isn‚Äôt a bad person, I just hate the way she treated me. 

And now I feel like she‚Äôs getting the summer she wanted just without me in the equation. She gets to work at a camp with all of her friends, so it feels like nothing even changed. Somehow I‚Äôm still on her Spam account, and it almost looks like she‚Äôs praising her friends for helping her through the breakup. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair when it feels like I got most of the damage done to me.

I was alternating between the single + double shot pre-programmed shot, and the shots were pulling very well with perfect extraction.

After a month, the shots started stopping pre-maturely. Rather than 25+ second pulls, it would stop within 10 seconds, so I started manually controlling the extraction time.

However, even with manual control, I still can't get the extraction to fall within the 25-30 second ideal range. I have the Baratza grinder, and I've grinded the beans to the finest setting, and yet, it is still extremely underextracted. The shots are pulling fine the first 5-10 seconds, but then they become incredibly watery and thin. I'm weighing every dosage (single shots are 10g, and double shots are 18g), but I keep running into the same problem. I end up manually stopping the shot at around 10-12 seconds (excluding pre-infusion time), because the shot looks disgusting to drink.

I'm doing everything as instructed - running an initial blank shot, adjusting the grind size, tamping pressure, etc. I worked at a specialty coffeeshop for a few years, so not being able to pull a better shot is extremely frustrating.

FYI - my beans are a medium roast blend from a specialty coffeeshop from when I went to Vietnam (roasted about a month ago).

I had two more of the same cups through the day. My first coffe always spikes me it i dont take insulin but any other through the day seem to not bother me. 

Hours later i was in range and ate 3 boiled eggs as a snack. Then about an hour after that I had a charcuterie style lunch with cheese, salami, and avocado. Thats it, no bread or anything.  I didn't dose because in the past when ive dosed for low carb lunch, my sugar crashes big time. 

I treated myself to about 3 gummy worms throughout the day. 

The last big spike is from a heavy lifting session followed by moderate cardio. It spiked me by about 60 points. Doctor says exercise it the one time im ""allowed to spike.""

My (25F) best friend (22F) is becoming rather judgmental and developing a bit of a superiority complex and I‚Äôm unsure of what to do about it. Around a year ago, she lost 75 pounds, got lip filler, got on accutane, and got a really good job for someone her age. She also graduated college a semester earlier. While I am SO proud of her and her success, unfortunately I am feeling a bit worried that some of her new found confidence is turning into an ego problem. She tends to have a lot of beliefs about the world and about people that are weird. She will also start a new habit, learn something new or develop a new skill and then immediately act as the divine oracle of that thing and judge other people for not doing the same thing as her. An example is she is on Keto, and it‚Äôs become a religion for her. She will say things like ‚ÄúCarbs are disgusting‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyone who eats carbs doesn‚Äôt care about their health‚Äù ‚ÄúMy sister is stupid for not being on keto‚Äù. She KNOWS I‚Äôm a huge fan of carbs. I literally regularly make my own pastas and it‚Äôs become a bit of a mindfulness hobby for me. She will also say things along the lines of ‚ÄúAnyone who doesn‚Äôt go to college doesn‚Äôt care about their future‚Äù ‚ÄúIf my friends actually tried they would have graduated early too‚Äù. I just moved to a new state, but when we lived in the same city and would go out together she would make weird comments about things I would do that she wouldn‚Äôt have done, but aren‚Äôt necessary to comment on. One time we got coffee and it wasn‚Äôt busy so I told the barista my drink was supposed to be iced. I paid like $9 for the latte and I wanted it the way I ordered it, and I was super polite about it. She said ‚ÄúI would have just drank it as is‚Äù. If I vent about someone making me uncomfortable, she‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄúOh that wouldn‚Äôt bother me, I know how to handle myself in that situation‚Äù. She will sometimes ask you a question just so she can explain how much she knows about a certain topic. She literally made a comment about MY job, saying I needed to be 1099 instead of W-2 even though it‚Äôs illegal in both states for my job to be 1099. She throws herself into work and makes a lot of comments about people who don‚Äôt work as much as she does. She‚Äôll say things like ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have 10k saved up by the time you‚Äôre 30 you‚Äôre a loser‚Äù. Just random sweeping statements about people and things that aren‚Äôt even necessarily true. We went out to dinner 2 months ago, and the food I got served was DISGUSTING. Like inedible. I kindly told the waiter that it didn‚Äôt taste right and I asked him to take it away, and asked if it could be taken off my bill. He was nice about it and complied. She told me that since I ordered it I should have paid for it and not said anything, but it was inedible and I was very respectful and polite. Like the food was burnt yet somehow also cold, and it tasted expired. She has also made judgmental comments directed toward someone in her life that also apply to me. We FaceTime at least 3-4 times a week, and the thing that pushed me over the ledge happened 2 weeks ago. She called me to complain about her coworker that apparently everyone at her office dislikes. I guess he is perceived as lazy and unintelligent, a bit of a buffoon. She calls him stupid and useless and even called him unprofessional for a mistake he made that she herself JUST made. She told me that everyone talks shit about him for the way he is. When I asked if anyone has given him any feedback or any sort of communication whatsoever on this, she laughed and said no. Apparently their BOSS joins in on the gossip, but also has no intention of saying ANYTHING to this poor guy. When I pointed out that he needs communication in order to grow in his role and to be aware of his shortcomings, she disagreed with me and said it doesn‚Äôt matter to any of them. I made up a reason that I had to get off the phone because it made me feel weird. I‚Äôm about to drive tomorrow to go visit her, and I‚Äôm incredibly nervous about being around her because I‚Äôm starting to feel uncomfortable/shut down when she makes these comments. In a lot of ways she is SO fun to be around or a really beautiful person, but it feels like whenever she can have the upper hand she uses it to feel better about herself. I think she‚Äôs deeply insecure inside and really unsure of herself and this is a big projection. The problem is this is starting to encroach on my own self esteem and make me feel insecure about things I normally otherwise wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm also nervous to make a mistake in front of her and I want to bring this up, but don‚Äôt know how. ",0,1748657064.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

We only had 32 reservations so 3 people got cut. Only 2 of us for dinner reservations on the terrace, one person in grill room for cocktail, and one person on east lawn.

Every morning, I grind fresh coffee beans around 7:30 AM before work - it takes maybe 30 seconds, tops. Never had a single complaint until the new guy moved in next door 4 months ago.

This dude (probably mid-40s) works nights apparently, but instead of talking to me like a normal person, he started leaving passive-aggressive notes under my door. First it was ""SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP."" Then ""The coffee grinder is EXCESSIVE."" Finally, last month, he escalated to filing a formal noise complaint with the landlord.

The landlord laughed it off since 7:30 AM is well within reasonable hours, but Prince Charming next door didn't stop there. He started banging on the walls whenever I used ANY kitchen appliance. Blender? BANG BANG. Microwave beeping? BANG BANG BANG.

So I decided if he wants to play the noise game, I'll play. Turns out I took opera lessons in college and still remember most of the vocals. Now I practice scales and arias every morning at 6 AM sharp - completely legal quiet hours end at 6 in our building.

The best part? When he came pounding on my door last week screaming about the singing, I innocently told him I'm ""pursuing my passion"" and that ""music is meant to be shared."" He tried filing another complaint but the landlord told him that practicing music during daytime hours is perfectly acceptable.

I've been doing this for 3 weeks now. This morning I started learning Wagner. Those pieces are REALLY long.

1kzlsre,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1kzlsre/advice_for_bad_experience_with_wedding_reception/,Advice for bad experience with wedding reception venue,"Hi,

My husband and I held a wedding reception last week and, for what we paid for it, the result was less than satisfactory. After talking to a few people, I was told that I may have a case for small claims court.

We rented the outside patio of an older historic building in a city park for 56 guests. It was $125 per person, including a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert, as well as wine/beer/coffee/tea/soft drinks. Additionally, we purchased a charcuterie board for $1,000. Per our contract and what we paid, after tax, gratuity, and the CC/ACH fee, it came out to $10,620.

The day of the reception, my mom came up to introduce herself to the owner and organizer of the event, who was at the charcuterie board cutting the brie. She was dismissive and didn't want to engage in conversation, which was weird to me since she had been fairly communicative throughout the process of setting up the event. She also never came up to say hi to me or my husband at any point, even though we had met in person previously.

The first bone of contention was the charcuterie board (photo attached). Basically, it looked like someone had bought about 20 of the Boars Head charcuterie packages from Target and spread them out very very thinly. There was a basket of Carrs Table Water Crackers, stale bread, a small dish of pickles, a bowl of olives, apricots and figs scattered throughout, and one bunch of grapes. It definitely didn't look like it was worth $1,000, maybe $300 at most.

Then, the entrees. My husband is Japanese so one of the appetizers you could select was gyoza. When it came out, it was only two small pieces. He was shocked at this. The dishes also came out staggeringly late from each other. My sister got her food 45 minutes before my moms, and one of my friends told me she thought that the time frame in which they served the entrees was weird.

This is more of a grey area, but on the quality of the food: My friend ordered a vegetarian stew and, when it came out, it was basically in the size of a cat food bowl. As for my entree, sonoma chicken, it was bland and the basmati rice had what we believed to be the remaining apricots from the charcuterie board (long taken away) tossed inside.

Another issue of concern was the poor customer service, aside from the friendly bartender. The entire night, we felt rushed. When I was sitting at the table, mid-conversation, a server tried to take my still-as-yet-unfinished entree twice. My friend got up to use the bathroom after his entree was delivered and when he came back, he found the server had taken it. He eventually went back and ordered Dominos since he didn't have anything to eat besides the appetizer and charcuterie board.

Additionally, considering the fairly hefty cost, we had water glasses on our table that were filled once the entire time by servers. I had to keep going up to the water station and filling my glass.

Then came the issue of the dessert. It never came out, even though it explicitly states in our contract that it was a three-course meal, including dessert. When my mom asked about why the dessert never came out, we were told it was because we had a cake (which we bought separately and had delivered from a bakery). She also asked for a cup of coffee to go with her cake and was told that the coffee pot was put away and she couldn't have it.

Throughout the whole night, there was a sense of being rushed. We had an MC who was organizing different speeches and playing songs. Even though it is explicitly stated in our contract that the event runs from 5 to 9, the servers started rushing him and telling him to wrap it up at 8, which he communicated to me. As a result of being rushed, our friend didn't get to propose the toast, nor did some of our other friends perform a dance they had prepared.

Additionally, four of the guests bowed out at the last minute. I let her know earlier in the day when I found that out and asked for a refund. I never got a response.

It appears the owner of the venue has a long history of asking for handouts, including a $200,000 GoFundMe to get the restaurant off the ground a couple of years ago and a lawsuit against ConEdison stating she was overcharged for electricity.

Taking all these things into consideration (obviously the food taste being the most subjective), would it be worth consulting a lawyer and, if so, what could we potentially be entitled to?

We planned everything ahead 3 weeks, decided we will stay from 27th of may till 1st of June. When we arrived everything was good, we had fun, went out to eat etc. everything was fine and perfect till the 29th of may, when in the morning we went for a bike ride all 3 of us, then we stopped into a park for a drink and gossiped a bit when M got really into her phone. We didn‚Äôt give so much importance to it, then we decided to walk to a restaurant to eat. M was silent all the time, when we got to the restaurant she didn‚Äôt really talk to us, was mostly on her phone and said she is talking to some clients. Her body language kinda changed, she would bite her inside lip, move her leg in a nervous way, looked a bit distressed. We tried talking to her but she didn‚Äôt really answered to us so we just continued eating ( she just ordered a coffee). After around 30 minutes she just asked if we would be ok with her going home, letting us know she already talked with another friend of hers to pick her up. I have to mention here we were in a different country, it was a 3 hour drive from our country here. I asked what happened and she said she is just in a bad mood and she doesn‚Äôt want to ruin our holiday. I insisted if we did something wrong she can talk with us and we can figure it out, but she insisted is just her bad mood lol. I thought it would be only fair that if we came together we should leave together, so I said we will all leave home then. We had a yoga appointment where she agreed to go still, and there she just made faces and basically wouldn‚Äôt answer when I asked her at the end if she liked it or not. Moving forward, I felt disrespected considering I was trying to make her feel better and we were planning on this trip for so long, I have to mention I was thinking about all the activities we could do there, she didn‚Äôt come up with any suggestions, so I decided we would go home that very night. To me it sounds a bit absurd to want to go home just for a bad mood, considering we were in another country. Even tho somebody would‚Äôve come to pick her up, still seems selfish to ask someone to drive 6 hours total just to pick you up cause you‚Äôre in a bad mood. Also, would it be worth it to ruin everybody‚Äôs holiday just for a bad mood? We were not obligated to go home with her but I felt off to stay there alone with my roommate considering we had plans to go out in the club all together the next night. Plus, she totally ruined my mood with this empty reason, and I didn‚Äôt want to put the other person in a dangerous situation of driving 6 hours total just to pick her up.

What s your opinion on this? I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. In a way I‚Äôm disappointed, in another way I wouldn‚Äôt want someone to feel forced to spend time with us. I thought about all the things I could‚Äôve said wrong, but we really tried to make her feel good and comfort her even tho she was ignoring us for no reason. It was literally super random, she just randomly said she wants to go home. I felt offended by the fact she found herself a ride before communicating anything with us.

His whip, a dark mess of some inhuman leather with moving spikes some a few inches long to others being feet long. As it flew into action, striking towards the bound god.

There was no reason to, even if he could dodge the incoming whip that seemed alive somehow‚Ä¶ like a snake searching for a tasty little rat. Wherever he ran it would follow. Mortal weapons couldn‚Äôt harm the gods. Granted this was no mortal weapon. It screamed darkness, blindingly dark, almost evil in nature. But why should the sky move to one mere mortal? He yearned for death, longed for it after all he was long past his prime and he laid forgotten here in this arena.

The whip cracked into the dark chains of night. A single fracture, then two, hair thin for now.

‚ÄúHere is the folly of the ‚Äòenlightened one‚Äô who dares defies the gods! Nothing will change, nor happen for a mortal can never harm a god!‚Äù 

Another strike this time a huge spike created a small hole, a single chain link falling to the ground.

At this Nyame felt a feeling akin to vertigo. A sudden swapping of the placement of his organs never felt good. His vision fell over. His body remained steady. But his mind was gone, at least his consciousness was fading for whatever reason. But why was he flashing now? It wasn‚Äôt uncommon in his bindings but he was prepared to see the same stuff. 

He was not surprised to see the field of cotton. This was common. The sting of the lash, a vipers tongue. His chains felt freer, but he knew it was an illusion made by his mind; a wild conjuration of an unused brain. 

Something had changed, right next to him was an odd thing. Something the color of the sky a few seconds after dawn. Blindingly white, and yet sitting on it a large, tall, figure standing like his people once were. It was on the tip of his tongue‚Ä¶ It was a newspaper! He had heard Athena speak to him in passing. None of these characters looked familiar‚Ä¶ wait it did‚Ä¶ It couldn‚Äôt be! This was a cruel joke! That enslaver was so honest about freeing them! Hah! Perhaps there is some justice in this cruel world!

Suddenly he was back. The Colonizer loomed over him, his blood coating the stones. Wait! His blood coating the stones! How long was he out? Why was his face wet? He felt no blood but still this made no sense. Then it clicked. He had cried? A god! A former ruler of Valhalla? But, his people were free. He realizes that he could dodge, his chains were lesser. He took pain from this yes, but he could move and fight and so much more! 

[Greek Box‚Äî- 5 minutes earlier]

Zues and Ares look interested as Leopold simply lets the whip do as it pleases. It winds around the seemingly uninterested Nyame, searching for any and all holes in the dark chains binding the God of the Sky. Simple yet cruel strikes from the whip constricting around the god as yellow blood slowly emerged from the god. Chains slowly fall away from the god like old parts of a chrysalis as a butterfly is ready to emerge. 

Ares startled speaks

‚ÄùWhaaaaaaa? What is that horrid whip? Why isn‚Äôt Nyame using the immense power you have spoken of father?‚Äù

Just as Ares spoke about this there was a large pounding on the door. Once. Twice.There was no third as the door simply dissolved into a spacious nebula of space of huge and massive planets. Shiva enters holding an oddly quiet and incapacitated Anansi, still chained and gaged. Shiva dropped the spider god as he saw how focused Zeus and Ares are. He bows to Zues, the lord of all

‚ÄúHeh that whip is surely weird.. Perhaps there is some god of metallurgy that made this for the dirty rebels. But uhh, that's not why I am here‚Ä¶ Your lordship. When the fight started this bug started convulsing and then stopped.‚Äù 

Athena goes to check the pulse of the spider god, feeling the result and returning to look at the fight. 

Zeus grimaces and replies without seemingly responding to Shiva‚Äôs worry.

‚ÄúWhen a god of the sky is forced to be contained like Nyame is‚Ä¶ the power is weakened. Especially how he gave me the throne. He also was stripped of his divine weapon to my knowledge. Look now, Nyame is moving! Perhaps he really was just asleep because that‚Äôs how little these humans threaten us. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Nyame stood. His sky blue eyes lock onto the stands of humanity. A man in a dark suit and tie, his skin the color of unsweetened coffee. His smile is a mile wide. Next to him is the enslaver‚Äî- No, the human who gave him hope‚Ä¶ the man who stands tall enough to cast a shadow onto the ground, A top hat and suit along with a joyous smile. 

As Lumumba and Lincoln look on the fight they begin to talk. 

Lumumba wept. ‚Äú Today the dream that was the United States of Africa that was slain now rises again. Mr. Lincoln, we are in quite a bind hmmm? We can‚Äôt cheer for our oppressors but our fighter is without a doubt more monstrous than Nyame.‚Äù 

Lincoln‚Äôs smile is a world wide wonder ‚ÄúThere is no question, Mr Lamumba, I am for Nyame. I may not have experienced the middle passage but even still I can imagine the pain and suffering caused. I may be able to apologize, but I can‚Äôt stop the pain caused.‚Äù 

Nyame focused back onto the stalking human in front of him. He wasn‚Äôt going to let this human hurt him anymore.Why should the sky be anchored to the ground? As the whip attempted to strike at him, Nyame bent over, folding himself over his spine as his body conformed not to the laws of godly anatomy but to his whims. After all he was the sky itself. 

[∆Üno a …îde ne ho s…õ omununkum]

Heimdall stutters as Nyame barely dodges the self sentient whip ‚ÄúThe god Nyame the strongest in all of Valhalla has seen the folly of these mortals and now will smite them‚Äù 

Nyame holds a small handful of sand with his blood, and simply blows it towards the Belgian king before he could react. 

[Anwea no abufuw]

A sudden squall of sand blew about, each grain as sharp as a knife. As this squall rose and struck at the Belgian king. As the dust settled there was no visage of the Belgian king but rather a cocoon of darkness, no whip visible, but even then there was a hole in this cocoon.  As the human bled out over the stones the gods cheered at victory. 

Buddha merely laughed. Guanyin grimaced and then slowly started

‚ÄúPerhaps we were wrong to choose him to represent us. Then again, is someone who needs to be a lesson for all of humanity. Nirvana can‚Äôt be reached when one is so greedy. There is always salvation, but he chooses to not because of his corporate greed.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPerhaps greed merely emerges from the need to be safe and protected, just overextended. This man is too human but his choices led him astray from removing himself from the pain and suffering of humanity‚Äù 


King Leopold grins as the whip returns from a rubbery cocoon. 

‚ÄúAnother dirty human to make me stronger. You won‚Äôt die here. You will serve me forever and always. A god subservient to humans. Yes‚Ä¶Yes‚Ä¶ I like this. I will have all of heaven on my leash. This time there is no escape, save the merciful death I and I alone choose to grant to those who outlived their use.‚Äù

The Marine stepped back into the canopy to go back to the video camera, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre cut, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, then let's begin,‚Äù Kelly put on a more ‚Äúserious‚Äù face. ‚Äú19 days ago, our world, through the coordination of 195 countries, braced for what could have been an extinction-level event. Over the past two and a half years, through blood, sweat, and tears, we built bunkers to protect ourselves from a major solar event. The event that was dubbed ‚ÄúThe Storm‚Äù by our intellectuals. But what we didn‚Äôt expect was that phenomenon to bring us here.‚Äù She made a simple gesture to her surroundings.

‚ÄúAnd what exactly does that have to do with your country being the 3rd largest in your world,‚Äù Tywin questions, taking a drink of wine, ‚Äú...if what you say is true.‚Äù

*Of course, he doesn‚Äôt believe us yet.* ‚ÄúEverything, all of our trade partners are gone.‚Äù Kelly then counted on her fingers, ‚ÄúIncluding the three most important ones: Mexico, Canada, and China. China was ahead of us in population and commodity output, while Mexico and Canada were our closest neighbors, literally. Canada was directly to our north, and Mexico to our south, we share the continent with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow China,‚Äù Capt. Richard gave a little chuckle, ‚ÄúWe had a‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ strange relationship with them, we were competitors in some areas, let‚Äôs just put it that way. They were a major provider of rare earth minerals that we don't have easy access to along with other commodities. The main source of those resources are in Canada and Mexico, but we do not have the machines needed to get to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt quite understand. You said that these‚Ä¶""Canada‚Äù and ""Mexico"" are gone. But you say what you need is still there. How can that be?‚Äù Ser Kevan‚Äôs eyebrow was raised high, and the others on his side agreed with him. ‚ÄúAnd why didn't they provide it to you in 'your world'?""

‚ÄúThey did, just not to the scale we need now. Our world had something called ‚ÄúFree Trade‚Äù, which allowed trade to move freely through our entire world. Thanks to it, we didn‚Äôt need to worry about losing that steady flow of materials‚Ä¶ until The Storm, that is. We purchased a decent amount of provisions in case we lost contact with the world, but that was supposed to be only temporary.‚Äù Kelly cleared her throat, ‚ÄúAs to your question of 'how they are still there'? Might as well show you.‚Äù *click*

The TV screen changes to a multicolored map, ‚ÄúNow this map is a work-in-progress, but it should give the gist of what we are working with. The orange area and yellow are now, with the work of Congress, have been designated as ‚ÄúCanadian Territory‚Äù and ‚ÄúMexican Territory‚Äù. As well as the former Central America and the Caribbean being made into territories as well.‚Äù *click*

The TV image changed to a scene of high glass towers, ‚ÄúThis was Toronto, Canada before The Storm. A population of 3.026 million people.‚Äù *click*. Now, it is a massive forest as far as the eye could see.‚Äù The screen showed lush, dense forest going as far as the eye can see.

‚ÄúAnd what's the problem exactly? You can't just take your‚Ä¶ machines and get what you need?‚Äù Ser Kevan questioned, studying the screen.

‚ÄúWell, the problem is that the infrastructure is now completely gone. No roads, no electricity, no plumbing. No necessities a modern mining operation needs to function. It all has to be built from the ground up, and that takes time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd with the new territories,‚Äù the Captain took charge, ‚Äúwe have to completely build up our fleet. We do have a large surplus of ships in what we call a 'mothball fleet', but those will need to be refitted for use. In addition to the older ships being put back into service as we speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you need more ships? It appears you already have a decent amount?‚Äù Tywin questioned the Americans. ‚ÄúI am sure a fleet of around two hundred ships should suffice, especially if they are all the size of the one you came ashore with. No?‚Äù He drank some more wine.

‚ÄúForgive me, Lord Tywin. I believe two hundred ships wouldn't meet our needs, especially just for defending our new territory gains. At recent count, we had around **290** Navy Ships in today, ranging from various classes. There's been talk in Naval Command of tripling that number. ***At minimum***.‚Äù Captain Webb explains carefully.

‚ÄúThat seems to be more than enough,‚Äù Tywin decides to poke the nest, ‚Äúfor such a small continent.‚Äù He smirked.

*Motherfucker, what?* Kelly gave a confused, squinted face, more dumbfounded at the comment. Even his brother, Ser Kevan, was taken aback at the comment.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt quite understand your meaning, Lord Tywin.‚Äù Capt. Richard's voice had a spoonful of venom in it for the Lord. ‚ÄúCare to explain?‚Äù He cocked his head a little to the left.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to offend, but if what you say **is** true, and you have a population in the hundreds of millions, then you must be piled on top of one another. Like a rat's nest. Nothing to be ashamed of, Kings Landing is the same. Too many smallfolk, they breed like rats as well. I‚Äôm sure you understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt, actually.‚Äù Now both Kelly's and the Captain's blood was starting to get hot. Thankfully, in Kelly‚Äôs case, her diplomatic training allowed her to remain calm and collected in front of a stubborn adversary.

‚ÄúWell, what can I say, you both are not highborn.‚Äù Tywin looked at Kelly, ‚ÄúYou confirmed that the moment you heard me call my cup bearer a bastard. Proper Highborn take offense to such, no matter the birth of their fathers.‚Äù

Deep down, Tywin knows that it probably is not a good idea to say all of those things, especially with those steel fleets still sitting just outside Lannisport. But his pride as a Lannister just couldn‚Äôt help it. Besides, he also wants to test further what these people are made of.

Meanwhile, after recomposing herself, Kelly decides that the Old Lion‚Äôs good courtesy must be paid in kind, and she knows the best payment for a man like him.

***‚ÄúFufufu‚Ä¶‚Äù***

So Kelly began to chuckle, like a mother bald eagle that spotted an old mountain lion near its nest in the Rockies. It was almost haunting to the Old Lion of the Rock.

‚ÄúDid I say something funny‚Ä¶ my lady?‚Äù Tywin lowly growled, as he was not amused at any sign of laughter, especially after his good yet naive father. His Westerosi entourage also has horrified expressions.

‚ÄúAh, pardon me, Lord Tywin. It‚Äôs just that we haven't used the term ‚Äúhighborn‚Äù since‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, ***250 years ago***.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù Lord Tyran gulped.

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs time for a history lesson then,‚Äù Kelly stood, grabbing the Chateau Montelena wine bottle and refilling her glass. ‚Äú250 years ago, the United States was originally a colony of a powerful kingdom called the British Empire. They were one of the most powerful, if not **the** most powerful, kingdom in our world from the 17th to the 20th century. In the later half of the 18th century, however,‚Äù Kelly began to move to fill everyone's wine. Walking around the table slowly as the eagle stalked the interloper lion, ‚Äúthere was trouble in our neck of the woods. At the time, we were simply known as the Thirteen Colonies of British America.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with not being highborn?‚Äù Tywin studied her as she decanted the wine into his cousin's glass.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting there. As I was saying, the British Empire imposed our people with high taxes on goods to pay their debts after a costly war against their enemy, the Kingdom of France. Oh, you could say that just makes sense. ‚ÄúYour king's army protects you, so you should help pay the debts involved.‚Äù And I would agree with you, but the problem is that at the time, the ‚Äú13 Colonies‚Äù had relatively more freedom than most, like the ability to govern ourselves and whatnot.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen the Empire forces their way in, and starts to levy taxes on almost everything. Tea, lead, ink, etc. All of this happened, and we didn‚Äôt get a say, a voice in the government. So what did we do? We boycotted everything. We held protests, demonstrations, and threw enough tea off a boat in Boston harbor, tea that was worth more than anything you own.‚Äù

The blood throughout Tywin's body began to boil. *I am no child to be talked down to. Woman!* Before he could reply, though, she fearlessly went on, all the while filling his brother's glass.

‚ÄúUnsurprisingly, their King, George the Third of his name, views it as an act of rebellion and calls his banners, the redcoats, against the colonists. One thing led to the other, civilians were shot, and people were angered, spiraling events that would spark our revolution, as the colonies finally took up arms against their former liege king. The Battle of Lexington and Concord, referred to as ‚ÄúThe shot heard around the world‚Äù, was the start of the American Revolution. Can you guess what happened later?‚Äù Kelly questioned the old man, a glimmer of a sadistic smile evident in her face.

‚ÄúYou won, that much is clear.‚Äù Tywin answered with a hint of annoyance.

‚ÄúYes, and after a hard-fought campaign, with the support of the Kingdom of France and the Spanish Empire, we finally expelled the king‚Äôs banner from our lands. Ever since, our people have sworn to never bend the knee for any king or queen. We even publicly elected our leaders once every four years, and when I said ‚Äúwe‚Äù, I mean *every single one of us*. Thus, the nation of the United States of America was born, where societal standings were decided by the merit of the individual, not by their last name‚Ä¶or even the cock that conceives them.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuch‚Ä¶tolerant ideals your people have there.‚Äù Tywin remarks with gritted teeth.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs tolerant, just the way the world actually works. I mean you should‚Äôve known at least someone who comes from nothing and yet managed to become something else, or even someone with a prestigious birth who couldn‚Äôt live up to their last names, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

Hearing it, Tywin can only scowl as he is reminded of certain Spider and Mockingbird in the Red Keep, scheming their ways and whispering poisons in the court. Furthermore, the last part of Kelly‚Äôs question also reminded him of not only his own good but inept man he called a father, but also the embarrassment of an imp that his‚Ä¶ son is.

*Speaking about the Spider,* *gods only know how many songs that perfumed eunuch‚Äôs have just gathered from his little rats in this city. Damn him to the seven hells!* Tywin mentally cursed.

‚ÄúI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù Tywin tersely denies.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good answer,‚Äù smiles Kelly, much to Tywin‚Äôs further annoyance.‚ÄúOf course, the path after independence is not a smooth one, and we have to stand against all odds, including almost splitting into two due to slavery issues. But we endured and always came out stronger than ever, including ending the slavery system that had been a blight on our nation. We even stand side by side with our former liege kingdom against one of the worst tyranny to ever exist and, in the process, succeed them to become one of the most powerful countries in the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is truly some‚Ä¶enlightening *tale,* my lady.‚Äù Tywin said in a tone of defiance.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you want to call it, then be my guest, Lord Tywin‚Ä¶ but I just want to remind you that our *farewell gift* is already on board our ship in this port, and we can always bring it down here right now. Then again, ***it‚Äôs your call***.‚Äù Kelly makes the final corner to her seat and pushes the cork back on the bottle.

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be needing this anymore. Bring us some coffee, please.‚Äù Kelly says to a Yitish looking woman.

‚ÄúYes, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù The Yitish then takes the bottle and excuses herself.

As they sat there, simmering in the silence. *Farewell gift? She's threatening to end the guest right? Hmm, you sure don‚Äôt play around, Lady Kelly.* Thought Tywin, then another came to his mind, devious, tempting, extravagant, and a final test for these Americans.

The eagle may have successfully fended off the lion from her nest, but the lion is old and proud and he wouldn't just give up that easily.

‚ÄúNow let's not get hasty, but first I think a trade is in order. To show our and your good will.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that would be?‚Äù

‚ÄúA war ship,‚Äù Tywin pointed towards the Savannah, ‚Äúthat war ship, she sure suffices to be exchanged for Maera to be in your service, along with four hundred gold dragons.‚Äù The mountain lion said as it took another approach to the mother eagle‚Äôs nest and challenged her once again.

‚ÄúMy lord,‚Äù Kevan exclaimed at the madness that came from his brother's mouth, ‚Äúsuch a trade is insane to start off with!‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you lost your mind! No way in hell am I letting go of my ship, let alone to you!‚Äù Captain Richard was on his feet now, the blood boiling throughout his body. ‚ÄúBesides, we were told you were a reasonable man by the maester!‚Äù He pointed to the shocked old man.

‚ÄúEasy there Captain,‚Äù Kelly calms down the Captain with resolute expression. Just like the old lion, the eagle is also not the one to easily give up as she readily accepts the lion‚Äôs second challenge.

‚ÄúI see, very well, but before we sign some contract, let me ask you a question, Lord Tywin, once we trade our ship to you‚Ä¶*what are you going to do with her?*‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me, my lady?‚Äù Tywin asked about a question that should have an obvious answer, at least for him.

‚ÄúWhat I mean is, if we give our *Savannah* to you, are you sure your sailors could actually handle her? As you can see, our ship is different from sailing vessels you are used to, as she doesn't even have sails, and she is also made of a special kind of steel instead of wood, so that means the way she works would be fundamentally different as well. Do you think your men, who couldn‚Äôt even read if I recall, have what it takes for a ship that even Maester Lorwell here struggles to understand?‚Äù Kelly calmly explains before continuing.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also the fact that she is a strong but delicate piece of technology that requires intensive care and maintenance *far* more complex than any sailing ship, and the only one who has the materials, tools, and personnel for that are us and *us alone*. After all, how else could we have ***15*** more ships of just the exact same type? Otherwise, you would only have a useless floating giant chunk of steel.‚Äù Kelly finished as her eyes sharply looked at Tywin, as the bald eagle finally cornered the old mountain lion over the edge of a cliff.

‚ÄúWell then, Lord Tywin‚Ä¶what is your answer? Should we proceed with the trade?‚Äù

***\*Snort***\*\* Hahaha, ouch, shame we couldn‚Äôt have her covered in a gator‚Äôs blood, but at least she should have the eye-twitching.\* Captain Webb thought, as his boiling anger was now replaced with amusement.

The room is about to become a battlefield, calm before the storm. Eyes went from one person to another, ready to strike. The gears of diplomacy turn in the heads of Kelly and Lord Tywin. Both sets of guards looked at one another in hesitation, wondering who would strike the first blow, the eagle or the lion?

Then, Tywin finally does it, something so terrifying that it will haunt the memories of his brother, cousin, and any other Westermen who sees it for the rest of their lives.

‚Äú***Haha‚Ä¶HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!***‚Äù

He laughed.

1kzlbu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1kzlbu9/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1kzlbpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kzlbpk/i_24f_cant_stop_being_angry_at_ex_21f/,I (24F) can‚Äôt stop being angry at ex (21F),"About a month ago, I received a FaceTime call from my long-distance girlfriend saying she didn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore. 

Yes, I go to therapy, and I‚Äôve vented to friends about how angry it makes me to think about how she treated me. I‚Äôve been advised to find distractions through hobbies, but since I‚Äôve got nothing really planned for the summer, I‚Äôm spending too much of my time and energy to think about her, and how much fun she‚Äôll have than me this summer.

We started dating April 2024. It was my final year of college, but she would stay there and continue her studies after I graduated in May. 
I had to move to a new city for a job, and I was living a few hours away from the college we went to. On average, I saw her 1-3 times a month. 
However, her family lived an hour away from me, and would host a family ‚Äúget-together‚Äù dinner once a month that we would both go to. Afterwards, my girlfriend would drive back home with me, and we'd spend the weekend together.

When we first started dating over the summer, I was very happy with the communication. We would FaceTime everyday, but once she returned to school, the communication got so bad, that we weren‚Äôt even talking everyday, just sending snaps.

I had expressed to her how unhappy I was with our communication, but it was always the same reasoning. She couldn‚Äôt talk to me because she was busy with classes, or hanging out with her friends. I started to get irritated because she would hang out with the same group of people at the same time everyday (for hours into the night) but couldn‚Äôt step away to call me? 

Around November, we stopped calling completely and would barely text. (I was always the one who would send the first text). 
There were several times I would text her, and she would leave me on read. It was a big deal to me because we were barely talking, and to be left on read made me feel like I was bothering her. She assured me I really wasn‚Äôt bothering her, and that she was just busy. She actually said that she would see my texts and forget to respond because she would get distracted by her friends talking to her(?) 
There were a couple times she wouldn‚Äôt respond to my text for an entire day until I sent a follow-up message. 

I started to feel like I was going crazy, that I wasn‚Äôt being understanding of how busy she was. As a college student, I was playing in ensembles, leading a sorority, and working part-time, so I understood the pressure of it all. But if I had a girlfriend, I would have always prioritized her.

When I would visit my girlfriend at college, I noticed she was way more talkative with her friends than me. There were times I would be a little disappointed, because her friends knew more of what was going on in her life than I did. I felt like I was always the last to know.

At the beginning of 2025, I became more vocal about how unhappy I was. She even got angry with me when I asked if she was getting my snapchat/ text notifications, because she had been constantly reminding me that she was just busy. There was a point where I just gave up trying to fix the communication. Anytime I would bring it up she just got annoyed. 

A pivotal moment for me was in February 2025, when she admitted that she would see a text from me and not respond. She said verbatim: ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt have time to deal with that right now.‚Äù 

Or another moment, when I told her I wanted to talk to her once a day on the phone, and she replied ‚ÄúWell, I think 1-2 times a week is fine.‚Äù

The first weekend of April 2025, she spent the weekend with me to celebrate our anniversary. I bought her flowers and a card, and they had been sitting on my kitchen counter. Not once during that weekend did she open my anniversary card.

I could tell something was off, because there was no cuddling, hardly any talking on her end, and completely no affection. I remember on the first night of our anniversary weekend, we got into bed, and she just flipped off the lights and said nothing.

I even made her breakfast, and bought her coffee. We went out to the mall and movies, but she barely spoke to me. When we got back to my place, she sat in silence on my couch, watching TikTok and playing games on her phone. She could tell I was upset, and to make it up to me, got us dinner and we watched movies for the rest of the night. Things felt better, like how they used to be when we would spend time together. 

(It was so odd, when we were together in our relationship, everything felt fine. The only issue was our long-distance communication.)

About a week after our anniversary, she FaceTimes me. She admitted that during our anniversary weekend, she had actually planned on dumping me. (Hence is why she was acting so stand-offish and having no drive to show affection). She said the main reasons were because: 

1.) She  didn‚Äôt like the way I interacted with her family. I had always been shy around them 

2.) She couldn‚Äôt stand not being able to touch me everyday. She was starting to not like the idea of being with someone she couldn‚Äôt see or touch everyday, because she was  ‚Äújust a touchy person‚Äù.

She said she wanted to give our relationship another shot, but this time, to really step up our communication. Apparently during our anniversary weekend, she was 80% sure of dumping me. That night she had flipped over without saying goodnight to me because she was on the verge of tears at the thought of dumping me. She admitted she had cried herself to sleep that night, and when she left my house to drive back to college. 

Although everything began to add up, I felt relieved, but also frustrated and confused. I had been trying to tell her for months that communication was the problem. She assured me that she wasn‚Äôt going to string me along, and genuinely wanted us to fix things. She even said she was excited for our future. 

From early April, We start calling/face timing every day. Things felt better. I even visited her at college for Easter weekend. We got drunk with her friends, she kissed all over me, and even hugged me and told me she loved me so much.
That weekend I went to her family‚Äôs Easter dinner, but I noticed she was almost avoiding me. I believe I exchanged more with dialogue with her family members than her. But when we‚Äôd talk at the event, she seemed okay. Her mom made us Easter baskets, and I finally started to feel like I was bonding with the family and coming out of my shell.

I had no idea that would be the last time I would see her or her family again. 

One week later, I noticed she‚Äôs not responding to my texts. I called her the Monday after Easter, and when she hung up, she didn‚Äôt tell me she loved me. I asked her if everything was okay, and she texted me ‚ÄúYes! I love you!‚Äù

She broke up with me the following Wednesday. That day I noticed she was very active on Snapchat, but not answering my texts or opening my snaps. And suddenly something in my mind just snapped. I realized I would actually be okay if we just broke up. I was so done with the lack of communication, a break-up felt needed.

Wednesday evening is when I got a Face Time call, and as you would expect, she finally dumped me (for real this time). I don‚Äôt know if she was just nervous, but she kept smiling and even looked like she laughed once. She didn‚Äôt seem sad or serious at all. She told me she was breaking up with me because she didn‚Äôt want to be with me. Also, because we didn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äùmorals‚Äù (what she really meant was that I had become very career-driven, while she just wanted to be a band director). Maybe she didn‚Äôt like that I had tried sports-bettings? She also said we just became different people. 

I was in shock, and when I started crying, so did she. I told her I would never think ill of her, but now I think I do. I don‚Äôt want her to be an evil ex, and I want us to one day be amicable,  but it‚Äôs hard when I reflect on how she treated me. Even towards the end when we were together, she would act so annoyed around me.

There were several other things that I, as well as my friends, found to be red flags. It felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her sexuality.  She had mentioned she wished she was straight if she had a choice, and that she didn‚Äôt like being lesbian. We also have a mutual guy friend (20M), who had said years ago (before me and my girlfriend started dating) that if she weren‚Äôt gay, he would have dated her. I jokingly brought it up to my girlfriend while sitting on the couch, and she said ‚Äúwell if I were straight, I‚Äôd probably date (20M) too!‚Äù
I had always been a little suspicious of that as well, and made me especially insecure because he was in her friend group. However, he does have a girlfriend who he has been with for a year, and he is crazy about her. He is also very respectful and supportive towards me and my girlfriend‚Äôs past relationship. (He was very shocked when she dumped me, and checked on me often, so don‚Äôt get the wrong idea that he may be a surprise villain.)

Recently, what has made me most angry is that 20M mutual friend of ours was surprised when I told him my girlfriend would barely speak around me when we were together. He said verbatim, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs surprising‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs talkative around our friend group all the time.‚Äù

I feel like a dumbass. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so angry I‚Äôm not even sure if she loved me. The first time she almost dumped me, I had asked her why she still told me she loved me when leaving me on our anniversary weekend. She told me that even if we we did break up, that wouldn‚Äôt mean those feelings wouldn‚Äôt be true. 
My friends think she did love me, but didn‚Äôt know how to show it. She really isn‚Äôt a bad person, I just hate the way she treated me. 

And now I feel like she‚Äôs getting the summer she wanted just without me in the equation. She gets to work at a camp with all of her friends, so it feels like nothing even changed. Somehow I‚Äôm still on her Spam account, and it almost looks like she‚Äôs praising her friends for helping her through the breakup. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair when it feels like I got most of the damage done to me.

We tried things our senior year of high school and it started off really well, but then she suffered an injury during her sport and she became really closed off and during our entire senior year we tried to make it work but we realized it wasn‚Äôt going to work, but she only said this after we both mutually agreed that we would do something about our feelings. We attended different colleges after this. During the first semester of my freshman year of college she reached out to me again just to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù. Once we both got back home for our winter break we decided to hangout and she said that she wanted to continue to hangout over our winter break. After that a few days go by and I asked if she wanted to hangout, maybe go to a coffee shop, things like that, and she ghosted me. Darth Vaders rage pitied mine. I was beyond mad. She never said anything after and never apologized or acknowledged it. She reached out to me for a third time after our freshman year of college, around July, to again just ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù. For whatever reason I responded to her and tried to use as few words as possible and not entertain anything. Around August after around a month of ‚Äúchatting‚Äù she said she wanted to see a movie, still don‚Äôt know why I said yes. We see the movie, nothing happens, we talk a little but that‚Äôs it. We don‚Äôt see each other for the rest of the summer but continue to chitchat. We both return to our respective schools and respond to each other maybe every other day. In October of my sophomore year of college, she pours her heart out, telling me how she wishes she could‚Äôve done things differently and how she thinks about me all the time. I fell for the sweet talk and floated the idea of trying things again. She said she wanted to try things again acknowledging she was the reason things didn‚Äôt work the first time and that it would be different. Things were fun for about the first month. After that she began to respond once per day, maybe every other, while I continued to respond quickly to her because I wanted to talk to her. We had to deal with long distance, I couldn‚Äôt see her, and now I couldn‚Äôt even get a text message from her. I‚Äôve told her numerous times this won‚Äôt work if she continues to be distant. The most recent time I brought it up, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I know that doesn‚Äôt mean much because I continue to do it.‚Äù Like wtf. She never says why she does it or says she‚Äôll stop doing it, she just says she knows. We very rarely hangout anymore because it just kills my mood so I don‚Äôt even ask if she wants to do anything. She said she thought we should build more of an emotional connection but still actively responds to a text message once a day. We used to communicate on snapchat but claims she didn‚Äôt respond because her notifications were off. We moved to messages and it‚Äôs the same stuff.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone to discover and explore erotic and sensual yearnings with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, or long intimate nights and days, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",3,1748654248.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

The impact of PCOS on my life  took its worst turn one year ago. As of March 2024 I was 39 years old, 193 pounds, 5ft tall, with a severe pain in my pelvis that kept worsening. For 3 years prior my weight fluctuated around 175 but 193 was my highest weight yet. I made it my goal to omit all unhealthy practices by eating organic/mostly whole foods and walking 5 days a week. By April 2024 I lost 10 pounds. But, the pain in my pelvis worsened. April 20th I went to the ER for severe pain in my ovaries.I had been unable to eat for 48 hours from nausea induced pain. I only had drank mint tea and water till that point. My CT scans showed the usual cysts on my ovaries with one prominent  4-5 mm cyst . I also showed an elevated sugar level. I notified the Dr I had been fasting for 2 days how could my sugars be raised? They just pushed that point aside. 
A few days later I saw my obgyn and we made a surgery date for July to remove the larger ovarian cyst. I did not make it to that planned surgery. On June 3rd they had to perform an emergency surgery due to crippling pain worse than childbirth that sent me to the ER. The pain was so great that 4 shots of morphine did not make a dent in the ER triage center. It was not till I was transported upstairs to surgery prep that the pain subsided after receiving my second shot of dilaudid that evening. We waited for my obgyn/prefered surgeon to be ready for the morning to operate.   At around 3 AM I was given a visit by the female DR on call that proposed I do a full hysterectomy within the hour. I politely told her I was on too much drugs to make such a sudden decision,  that was not in my surgery plan, and most importantly that is something I needed to discuss with my husband. She left with her tail between her legs. 
That morning during surgery my DR. discovered a 6mm cyst straddling my fallopian tube like a jump rope. The twisting was cutting off blood supply that was undetectable via CT scans or Sonogram. Had the cyst not been removed its continued pressure on my fallopian tube would be life threatening. They removed the cyst and fallopian tube but saved the ovaries to keep my hormones stabilized. I was also put on metphormin, given an IUD to stabilize my uterus, and act as a preventive of cancer. 
Untill then I had not had a menstrual cycle for 1 year. Birth Control was not an option due to stroke symptoms every time we tried a different brand. My problem of menstruating only once a year had been happening since I was 28. 
From that point onwards I made it my point to continue to lose weight, be healthy, and heal my PCOS.
 Despite my continued efforts, calorie deficient diet, and religious working out ethic my weight nor my pcos would budge. My weight would fluctuate between 175-183. I weighed more than when I gave birth in 2017. 
Prior to giving birth in 2017 I had not been overweight since I was 14 yrs old. At 14 I was diagnosed with PCOS when 20 cysts on each ovary were detected via sonogram.
That year I  lost my extra weight from fasting and continued to battle my weight for many years. I would ultimately stay thin and healthy through my teens and 20s but it took a lot of work including daily exercise and sometimes intermitent fasting. During my healthiest stages my period was always irregular and would arrive every 3-4 months. At the age of 28 my period started to occur every 6 months to a year despite practicing a very healthy lifestyle and being in a healthy BMI of 115 - 120 pounds. My body was very lean with a high muscle mass. I ate well and healthy.  I was also an avid Bikram yoga lover. This meant 90 minutes practicing yoga in a 104 degree temperature room 3 - 5 days a week accompanied by running or hiking on alternating days. 
Even then during my healthiest my periods were irregular, and any any use of birth control would cause stoke like symptoms of pain in my legs and arms. 
6 months prior to marriage in 2016 my now husband and I tried to get my menstruation cycle back on track in prep for starting our own family. I was told to lose 10 pounds and start metphormin by my doctor, even though I was at a healthy weight of 128 pounds. I argued that at 115 pounds my body would shrink to a size 2 clothing with a 25 inch waist as it had been for many years before. It would all just be asthetic. I also argued that my body weight never changed my irregular periods through my whole menstruating life. If anything my menstruation cycle kept getting worse despite my avid working out and healthy living. 
I lost 5 pounds anyways and starred the metphormin. I had a regular period for 3 short months. And then it stopped all together right before our wedding. My Dr. Chalked it up to nerves. I continued the metphormin and was told my chances of conception were very low. Not to even think about pregnancy and just work on my health. After our honeymoon my weight suddenly hit a 145 pound mark even though I did nothing different in my nutrition or activity levels. I couldn't understand it. I thought perhaps it was stress or the metphormin medication. Then 4 months after our wedding, without a period, while taking metformin, I was pregnant! Stranger things have happened, so we took this surprise as a blessing and were overjoyed. Especially after coming to terms we would most likely have to adopt or do IVF. 
I was 172 pounds when  I gave birth to my daughter. Within 3 weeks of birth I shot down to 145 pounds. And then began the yoyo of weight that would drive me crazy for 7 years.  No matter how I ate, exercised or behaved. My body would pack on pounds in unexplainable fashion overnight. My period also seemed to be a phantom that would appear once a year. Despite sonograms and progesterone pills. Sometimes the pills woukd work but then I would bleed profusely for 2 week periods and it became a health risk. We never did conceive again. 


Fast forward to this past year. After months of working out at an exhausting calorie deficient lifestyle of lean meats, veggies, and fruits, my moral began sinking. Doctors didn't believe me. I must be lieing or sneaking food. I would average on 2 pounds lost every 2 months,  only to gain it back for no apparent reason. One day I did a 5 mile hike/run ate very healthy and gained 2 pounds in my sleep. The straw that broke my camels back was when I got food poisoned for 3 days, meaning everything came out of me like water, and I could only eat very light brat foods like apple and toast. Guess what‚Ä¶I gained a pound after those 3 days. At that point I broke down crying to my husband because I felt like an insane person. Doing everything all the nutritionists tell you to do, with NO results. I was so tired, and angry. 

My husband went online and did some research and came across the PCOS Plan by Dr. JASON FUNG  I received it on May 1st and started it the same day. 
That's when I read about the metabolic syndrome associated with PCOS. This was ME! I had finally found the missing puzzle piece to why my weight would fluctuate with no regaurd to my hard work. It made sense why all the weight was mostly in my mid section and my ability to menstrate was an impossible black hole of questions. 
Once I started fasting and ommiting the hidden carbs/sugar in the specialized diet the pounds starting coming off with ease. For example I had no idea a simple culprit like onions had enough starch and carb power to throw my sugar levels into wack forcing my body into an elivated fat storing mode. 
Additionally I started working out less and only doing short 30 minute HIT style workouts of high intensity 3 times a week. I kept walking or hiking. But I didn't feel over run with exhaustion. What I thought had been weight gain due to stress of motherhood was now very clearly from one culprit. Sugar. For every teaspoon of honey I had been putting in my healthy morning yogurt, my body had been hard wired to store all my days fat because of my metabolic syndrome.
Here is the craziest part. I started my period after one week of starting this diet. It wasn't a light spotting as usual, but a real healthy menstrual cycle. I was floored! Maybe a second child, even though I am now 40, is in site!
It has been 1 month since reading  and practicing this book and I have lost 15 pounds and 3 inches on my waste with ease.  I am 165 pounds to date. I still have 40 pounds to go, but I feel like I finally have a true understanding of my body and why my PCOS had taken full hostage once I gained weight in pregnancy. My sugar and metabolic resistance was like an out of control snowball with no end. 
The change in my diet was extremely easy because I have been living with celiacs disease for 10 years. This meant I was able to hard wire the idea of sugar and carbs being a negative food in my brain just I have for gluten. I eat a handful of berries with whipped heavy wipping cream,  lemon zest, and pecans, similar to a dessert recipe in the book, when I really have a sweet tooth hankering. The coffee mug almond flour bread is also one of my favorite recipes. I am also looking forward to my birthday where I can splurge , as directed in the book, with drinks and cake. As well as all other major holidays. I know once I hit my healthy BMI that my low carb lifestyle will not be so militantly stringent. When the time comes I can dip my sushi in soy sauce and it wont break my progress, but until then I will keep at it. 
 I am questioning why this book is so highly gate kept and pushed aside by other PCOS communities. I know the demands in the book seem hard, but if choosing between avoiding hard versus what's good for your health‚Ä¶I choose the battle.

1kzkw0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/1kzkw0a/34m_chat_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34/M [Chat] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.

1kzkvs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetFriends/comments/1kzkvs2/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748653854.0,DigitalFriendz,1,1.0,False

1kzktju,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1kzktju/replacement_for_delonghi_esam3500/,Replacement for De'Longhi ESAM3500,"Hello,

**TLDR**: 
I'm in the market for a new super automatic. Our ESAM3500 is super old, probably getting uneconomical to repair. Drink mostly black coffees, but the wife likes a splash of milk. Occasionally like a lat√©.

Budget: $1,000 AUD

Location: Australia 

**Longer version**

My wife and I purchased a Delongi Magnifica ESAM3500 second hand for $250AUD in 2016. It had a new brew group and service in 2019, a new boiler in 2021 and needs another new boiler. 

The boiler shows infinite resistance across the heaters and the machine will time out. If I hear the boiler with a hair dryer I can get it to boot up and make coffee but this isn't sustainable.

The French press has made a resurgence while the De'Longhi has sat on the bench for about a year while I decided whether or not to buy a new boiler or put the money towards a new machine. 

Given we have had it for 9 years (not knowing how old it actually is), the last boiler only lasted 2-3 years and only 2 or 3 buttons work on the control panel I'm inclined to put the money towards a newer machine.

I've been browsing this sub-reddit to understand what potential options are. I would budget up to $1,000AUD. The wife likes a super automatic for the simplicity so that is what I'm leaning towards.

We occasionally make lat√©s but she mostly drinks long blacks with a splash of milk while I lean to black coffee (short or medium shot). My go to was a double medium shot (because the short and long shot buttons stopped working most of the time).

**What I think I should buy**

I think a Magnifica Evo or Evo Next would be a suitable replacement. Before committing, is there any other brands or models I should consider?",1,1748653747.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
