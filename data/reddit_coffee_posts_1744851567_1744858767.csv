## What is Swap Lasix?

Swap Lasix is an **automated trading platform** that helps users trade digital assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and even commodities. The main selling point? It uses **AI and real-time data analysis** to make smarter trades for you‚Äîor at least help guide your decisions.

What makes it stand out from other platforms is that it doesn‚Äôt just execute trades based on simple bots. It claims to adapt to market trends using machine learning, which is a fancy way of saying it gets better the more you use it. It‚Äôs built for people who want to trade efficiently without spending all day watching price charts.

## Who Created Swap Lasix?

Swap Lasix was reportedly developed by a group of fintech engineers and crypto enthusiasts. While the exact founders haven't plastered their names all over the site (which is common with platforms in this niche), the system shows similarities to platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**‚Äîwhich suggests it might be part of a broader white-label network of trading platforms.

Even though the creators aren't super public, the functionality and design show that some solid tech minds are behind it. There's a level of polish here that you don‚Äôt often see in fly-by-night operations.

### [üî• Start Trading with Swap Lasix Today](https://tinyurl.com/3d4nww6v)
## How Does Swap Lasix Work?

At its core, Swap Lasix uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan market data in real-time and execute trades based on trends, indicators, and price patterns. You can either let it run in auto-mode or use it manually with real-time insights.

Here‚Äôs a simple breakdown:

- **Automated Mode**: The platform places trades for you based on pre-set strategies.
- **Manual Mode**: You get real-time alerts and analysis so you can make your own trades.
- **Risk Settings**: You can customize how aggressive or conservative you want your trading to be.

It connects to various exchanges or brokers depending on your region and asset class. Once you fund your account, the system starts suggesting trades‚Äîor executing them automatically if you‚Äôve enabled that.

## Swap Lasix Pros and Cons

Like any tool, Swap Lasix has its strengths and some room for improvement. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Easy to use** interface (great for beginners)
- ‚úÖ **AI-driven analysis** that actually feels helpful
- ‚úÖ Supports **multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Customizable alerts** keep you on top of the market
- ‚úÖ Offers a **demo account** to test before going live

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Minimum deposit** of $250 might be steep for total newbies
- ‚ùå Lack of transparency about the **founding team**
- ‚ùå Some features can feel overwhelming at first

### [üëâ Open Your Swap Lasix Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/3d4nww6v)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Swap Lasix?

One of the best things about Swap Lasix is its **cross-device compatibility**.

You can access it on:
- **Desktop or Laptop** (Windows, Mac)
- **Mobile devices** (iOS and Android)
- **Tablet browsers**

There‚Äôs no standalone app yet, but the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. Pages load fast, and the layout is optimized for smaller screens.

## Swap Lasix ‚Äì Supported Countries

Swap Lasix is available in a wide range of countries, but it‚Äôs **not global** just yet. It works in most of **Europe, Asia, Oceania, and parts of South America**. The U.S. has limited access due to regulatory reasons, which is pretty common with automated trading platforms.

If you‚Äôre unsure whether it‚Äôs available in your country, the signup form usually tells you right away based on your IP address or the info you provide.

## Swap Lasix ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Swap Lasix‚Äôs AI is constantly scanning the market for price changes, trends, and indicators. It‚Äôs like having a full-time analyst working for you‚Äîwithout the analyst salary.

This feature is especially handy during volatile market swings. It reacts faster than a human can and helps you avoid emotional trades.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and intuitive. You don‚Äôt need to be a finance geek to use it. The main controls are labeled clearly, and the setup process is pretty much plug-and-play.

Even if you‚Äôve never traded before, you‚Äôll get the hang of it within a few sessions.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there‚Äôs no native app yet, the mobile browser version is *really* good. I tested it on both Android and iOS, and the experience was smooth.

You can check your trades, set alerts, and even fund your account‚Äîall from your phone while standing in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price movements, trade executions, and even news-related events. This helps you stay informed without being glued to the screen 24/7.

Want to know when BTC drops below $30K or ETH spikes by 5%? Boom‚Äîset an alert.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Swap Lasix isn‚Äôt just for crypto. You can also trade **forex, commodities, and indices**. This makes it a solid option for people who want to diversify without opening five different accounts.

The asset list isn‚Äôt as deep as a traditional broker, but it covers all the big names.

## Is Swap Lasix a Scam?

Let‚Äôs get real‚Äîthere are a ton of shady platforms out there. But after testing and researching Swap Lasix, I can say it‚Äôs **not a scam**.

Here‚Äôs what gave me confidence:
- The platform actually works and **executes trades as promised**
- **Funds are accessible**, and withdrawals are processed (mine took 24 hours)
- There‚Äôs **customer support** that responds (not lightning fast, but solid)
- Offers a **demo account**, which scam platforms usually *don‚Äôt*

Still, like any trading platform, it‚Äôs not risk-free. Don‚Äôt dump your life savings into it.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Swap Lasix?

The **minimum deposit is $250**. That‚Äôs standard for platforms in this category (Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, etc.). It‚Äôs enough to start trading while minimizing risk, but I still recommend starting small and scaling up as you get comfortable.

### Swap Lasix Customer Support

Customer support is available via:
- **Live Chat**
- **Email**
- **Support Ticket System**

I tried the live chat and got a response in under 10 minutes. Not bad. They were helpful, though not super detailed. For more complex issues, email is the better route.

## How do you start trading on Swap Lasix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Swap Lasix homepage and fill out a short form with your name, email, and phone number. It only takes a minute.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You‚Äôll get matched with a broker based on your region. Then you‚Äôll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff) and deposit at least $250 to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can either activate auto-trading or start using the dashboard for manual trades. I suggest starting in **demo mode** to get a feel for how it works.

## How to Delete a Swap Lasix Account?

If you ever decide to peace out, deleting your Swap Lasix account is pretty straightforward. Just contact customer support and request account deletion. You‚Äôll want to **withdraw your funds first** before initiating deletion to avoid any complications.

### [üî• Start Trading with Swap Lasix Today](https://tinyurl.com/3d4nww6v)
## The Verdict

Swap Lasix is a **solid choice** for beginners and intermediate traders who want a smarter, faster way to trade. The AI features, mobile accessibility, and multi-asset support make it more versatile than most auto-trading platforms I‚Äôve tested.

It‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîtransparency about the creators and better onboarding tutorials would be nice‚Äîbut overall, it delivers on its promise.

If you‚Äôre looking for a way to dip your toes into trading without feeling overwhelmed, Swap Lasix is definitely worth checking out.

I was on speakerphone and asked my child how his night was and what he was doing, and he said hanging out with (new girlfriend‚Äôs name) and daddy. I didn‚Äôt want to react around my son. 

My main point of this is we had an agreement that if either of us had a significant other come into our life, we wouldn‚Äôt introduce him to our son for at least six months and for the safety of our child and comfortability of the other parent, we would meet first For coffee something simple just to get to know the other person.

I kept my cool and just told him that I‚Äôm happy he met someone that makes him happy. Mentioned I was disappointed that he didn‚Äôt stick to our agreement, but I would like to meet the woman who is around my child. 

They have only been dating about a month from my knowledge. 

We exchanged a few texts and he sent me a screenshot of our own conversation that he meant to send to her. Am I overreacting by thinking this is absolutely insane that any conversation I have with my ex now is basically being a screenshot it and sent to her? 

Another issue I have is he barely sees his dad to begin with. He only has him a couple times a week and he chose to have this woman over. I don‚Äôt know how many times but one for sure when he should be spending time in bonding with his father until things are more serious with that relationship.

Context:
Realized that I've been slaving away at work too much and have been left behind regarding current events and the vibe in general - literally it's been a blur. I attended a wedding of one of my hs barkadas last week with me just fying in that morning (Friday) and then flying back to the metro the morning right after (Saturday) because I had meetings already set on Monday and some stuff needing my signature. My whole barkada went to vacation (they're still there) to a remote island and I see they've been having so much fun. I'm very ok with my situation tho, I am comfortable. Ngl, lowkey jealous of many people that can have time to be carefree.

Recently been musing that I want 2025 to be the year I finally have my ISBN - i would need time to relax, free my head, and write (poetry). I just need  quiet time to relax and a place that's peaceful.

Long weekend's here and I don't have plans yet. I can invest in time and maybe make these next 4 days a build up of foundation for great new friendships. Not really keen on a relationship, I may have crossed over the line already for any interest. I just want to get to know the younger crowd and feed off good energy. I have gotten to know that a lot of people younger have great insights in life, are yearning to build up themselves (which I find fascinating a topic for writing) and definitely know more about the local scene.

9. Please be around makati/bgc for easier logistics (just a preference)
10. Maybe become my wingman in the future? I love brutally honest and unapologetic people. Would be great if you can teach me about wines and sht.

Match 1: Gwanak Byeoksan FC 8-0 Gwanak AS FC  
Match 2:  Yangcheon TNT FC 2-0 Seongdong FC Together  
Match 3: Mapo Hampton EMC 0-5 Yongsan Geonyung FC  
Match 4: Jungnang District FC 1-5 Gangdong FC ITPL

\*\*\*\*\*

The K5 to K7 leagues are Korean‚Äôs amateur leagues. The K7 League is divided into small divisions based in small cities or districts in larger cities. K6 League divisions cover maybe half of a large city, and¬† K5 League will include all of a large city or an entire province. In the capital area, with its high population, there is a high concentration of divisions at all levels.

Today I‚Äôm on my way to watch the first round of the Seoul division of the K5 league. Unsurprisingly, the Seoul division has a few notable teams. In recent years, FC Byeoksan, based in Gwanak-gu, won the overall K5 title, and even made it to round three, where they fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated by a Gimpo FC that finished high in K2 that year. TNT FC is a club that takes pride in its professionalism. They claim to pay players match fees, and the club's mission is to prepare players for life in the professional leagues. TNT also has more weekly training sessions than any other team in this division. They train every day, while some teams train as few as two times a week. Lastly, there is KY FC (Geonyung FC), the team selected to represent Seoul in the 2025 Korea Cup.

Of the remaining three, ITPL‚Äôs goal seems to be to help players for life in other countries, which is understandable because the team was initially formed by a group of players who returned to Korea after studying abroad. FC Together claims to put team harmony above all else, while AS FC, Hampton EMC, and Jungnang District FC have information online.

Just before I left home, the skies darkened, and something that looked like snow started dropping from the black things that might have been clouds. And this was accompanied by winds so strong that it was shaking the outside sliding doors, and blowing plastic back up and over 15-floor apartment buildings. I had serious doubts about coming, but as quickly as the ominous weather appeared, it disappeared, and I gathered my resolve to go watch football.

Today‚Äôs Round 1¬† matches will be held in a public field tucked between Hanyang University and a feeder stream to the Han River. It‚Äôs a short walk from the subway station and easy to reach. I feel confident about the area because I attended the 2024 Homeless World Cup at Hanyang University. I have everything I need in a waterproof bag, and I‚Äôll be early enough to find a hot lunch before the matches start.

On the way, I receive a message from my wife saying that the transfer station had a fire and I might need to find another way. While I‚Äôm scrambling to make sure I have everything for an early transfer, she sends a second message saying it was small and everything seems fine. Crisis averted, and I can go ahead with the original transfer. I eventually reach Konggug University, and since I‚Äôm at the end of the platform, I have a chance to look out the station windows for restaurants. There are a surprising number that I don‚Äôt remember seeing on the map. Even stranger, everything looks unfamiliar after I exit through the gates. Why? And why does that board say the train in the opposite direction goes to Hanyang University and Wangshimni?! \*Deep breath\*

Last year, while attending matches at the 2024 Homeless World Cup, I arrived at Hanyang University from the South. Coming from the West, I was caught off guard by how close the University is to the transfer station, never realised I went straight past. Now I‚Äôm three stops away and not within walking distance. I won‚Äôt have time to find lunch before the matches start, so I stop by the station bakery to grab some sad-looking bread before jumping back on the train. At Hanyang University, the correct station, I pick up a coffee to ward off the cold before heading to the playing field.

I know I‚Äôm at the right place when I get there, because I see FC Byeoksan‚Äôs fan club. It‚Äôs my third time at a Byeoksan match, and I know that no other K5 team in Seoul has one man with a drum and a handful of chants cheering them on. The teams are also ready to walk onto the field.

[The Battle Field](https://preview.redd.it/kab5nj2d4bve1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d460aa1109b2ba5ac98ebf63512753e93f5131)

The field is so new that Kakao Maps' street view only shows construction work in the area. Now there is a large field with an artificial surface. The field has markings for one full-size pitch or two medium-sized pitches. There is a stand of sorts behind one of the goals. It consists of giant steps that serve as seats. There are five to ten spectators who I assume are either related to the team or friends and family. Who else would come all this way in this weather to watch Tier 5 football? That would just be silly. Next to the football field is a small baseball field, and throughout the afternoon, children and parents pass by to play in what I assume is the Korean version of Little League Baseball.

In the amateur leagues, all matches are played at a single location on the same day, one following another. In the K5 League, they play full 90-minute matches, and the four matches today will run from 1 pm to almost 8 pm. This is either amazing or ridiculous, depending on your viewpoint

The first match is a one-sided clash between FC Byeoksan vs AS FC. Most of the match is played in the AS half, where they allow a steady stream of goals. But what makes the match memorable is the weather. It shifts between overcast and sunny, rain and no rain, and sunny while raining. At one point, we had something too big and round to be snow, but too light and soft to be hail. It was during one of these snow-like periods that the match was briefly stopped. The field has no protection from wind, and the match is stopped when the wind blows so hard that players must shield their eyes. Boxes and chairs making their way onto the field don‚Äôt help either. All of this is happening at about 5 degrees Celsius, and you must admire the dedication of the players to stay on the field.

The match turnover is so rapid that when half-time arrives, the teams playing in the next match take the field to warm up. Just before the end of one match, the next teams are already lined up to take the field. As soon as the last player from the previous patch leaves the field, the teams run on, greet each other and take 5 minutes for a final warm-up before the match officially starts.

During the break in the Byeosan vs AS match, I scrape together the courage and go over to the Byeoksan fan to ask him his name. If I‚Äôm going to see him again, I‚Äôd like to say ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù Frustratingly, I still don't know his name because he only gives me his YouTube channel name, ‚ÄúUniq Footbal Fan‚Äù. I‚Äôm the 12th subscriber of the channel where he occasionally live-streams to talk about football, and interacts with the one or two people watching. He also records himself while he cheers and uploads it as a vlog, complete with an introduction about the day‚Äôs match.

The second match is the hardest fought of the day as TNT FC takes on FC Together. Both teams seem desperate to win, and tackles are nasty. Some of the tackles are so ridiculous that I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm watching Association Football or Rugby Football. Near the end of the match, tensions boil over when a TNT player goes in too hard on a Together player.. It gets so heated that two referees have to rush and keep the players apart. And just when everything seems calm, the Together manager storms over, but is blocked by a team effort of one TNT and one Together player. I don't understand how that didn't start things up again. This is also the only match where there is obvious support. Together FC as a group of easily 20 people cheering them on, complete with team colour raincoats. But they have no drums or chants, so Byeoksan FC wins that battle.

[Hampton vs KY - Not confusing at all.](https://preview.redd.it/ev1ohdkn4bve1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=248e33af1b4a03fdee5f59ab552fe40c2b8de7db)

The third match is another one-sided one, with Hampton taking on Geonyung (KY) FC. KY‚Äôs dominance is not surprising since, as mentioned previously, they were Seoul‚Äôs K5 representative in the Korea Cup this season. But I don‚Äôt even notice the score, because I can't take my eyes off the [marshmallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slT80EySpKk&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29) that is the KY keeper. The man had the genius idea to wear a padded jacket under his shirt. It looked ridiculous, and I love it. He seems a bit of a character. As soon as he arrives at his goal, he swings his arms around a few times, turns in my direction, pulls the strangest face, and exclaims in Korean: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold!‚Äù In case you didn't know, Koreans are genetically, culturally and possibly even legally required to state it out loud every time they feel cold. He also looks like one of the laziest keepers ever, but comfortably blocks every goal attempt. Although I didn't see the match, I hear he was on fire in the KY‚Äôs Korea Cup match. Despite not letting in even a single goal, he is substituted at half-time for a non-marshmallow-looking player. It reminded me of Seoul Martyrs FC, who always used both keepers, possibly to avoid letting one keeper concede more than 5 goals per match.The final match is Jungnang District FC vs FC ITPL. Earlier in the week, I contacted ITPL on Instagram and received a reply. I was hoping to chat with someone about the club, but I have no idea who I‚Äôm looking for, or even which of the two teams warming up is ITPL. Sure, I can just call someone over and ask which team is which, but I already spent my ‚Äútalking to strangers‚Äù quota by contacting them on Instagram and then talking to the Byeoksan fan. I walk past the players warming up, hoping the person I chatted with on Instagram calls me, the only non-Korean over, but it doesn't happen, so I go back to the seating area to mope.

Without the prospect of talking to someone from ITPL, and with the sun setting behind the buildings, I decide that I will not be able to handle another two hours of the cold, and grudgingly go home. As much as I wanted to watch all four matches, I‚Äôm glad I went home. Even two hours later, after I‚Äôd been in the apartment for almost an hour and had dinner, I still feel cold.

1. The dog shit Jason Aaron Ninja run straight up ignores one thing that I feel defines Punisher. And these panels prove that. Micro is back from the dead offering Frank his family back. But that means making a deal with the devil, the sum of all evil, which is exactly who the Punisher hunts. All of a sudden now willingly become host to a demon called the ‚ÄúBeast‚Äù, who, he should know about since the whole Shadowland incident was caused by the Beast, makes zero sense, it actually makes negative sense. 

2. He still has feelings, regardless of how recently he‚Äôs painted as a one dimensional heartless killer. Whereas the Netflix version is more outward and outspoken with how he feels. Comic Frank is always more subtle. At the end of ‚ÄúIn the Blood‚Äù, Henry thinks his mom has given him some hard to find records, when she tells him she had no idea where he was, and he realizes it was Frank all along. Same goes for the whole Franken-Castle bit, while not a traditional Punisher story, he essentially embodies the same war against a new foe. Regardless of whether innocents are human or monsters, he doesn‚Äôt tolerate the loss of innocent life. 

Whereas this is a run that paints him more cold hearted and rougher on the edges than others like Edmonson, who had him having coffee at diner and chatting up and becoming a regular. Regardless, I feel like it‚Äôs a run that while isn‚Äôt my favorite, does deserve more of a spotlight. Frank does what Frank does best, going after the bad guys regardless where on the food chain they may be. Also this was the series that gave us the Ant-Man Punisher scene, so bonus points there.

I've lost 20 pounds since, mostly because of feeling full early. 

Around Christmas, I started getting sharp pains in my upper left abdominal area, right under my ribs. It would alternate through sharp stabby, pinchy, cramping. I couldn't find a pattern. I did a liquid and very soft food diet for a week and it calmed down. It happened again in February but no fever or bad bloodwork. Dr ordered CT.

CT Scan said ""Slightly abnormal appearance of the proximal stomach which could reflect a prior Nissen fundoplication versus posterior gastric diverticulum.""  Nothing like this was mentioned in last year's CT scan.

I've never had that fundoplication so my Doctor did an endoscopy and no gastric diverticulum was observed and I was negative for h. Pylori. No ulcers or other findings. I have a follow up next week. I'm still getting the crampy and pinchy but not as bad as two months ago.

As the houselights dim and the first notes of The Nightman Cometh ripple through the theater, one is thrust into a world of such audacious brilliance that it feels as though the very soul of musical theater has been reborn. Crafted by the inimitable Charlie Kelly, this live stage production is a dazzling fusion of fantasy, romance, and comedy‚Äîa work that demands to be hailed as one of the greatest musicals ever to grace the boards. With a narrative that pulses with mythic grandeur, characters that sear themselves into the heart, and a symbolic depth that unfurls like a velvet curtain, The Nightman Cometh is nothing short of a revelation. Kelly‚Äôs visionary approach, including his bold, if fleeting, use of spray paint inhalation to channel the Nightman‚Äôs dark essence, imbues the production with an authenticity and daring that place it alongside Wicked, Rent, and Hamilton. This is not merely a musical; it is a transformative odyssey that every theatergoer must embrace as a cornerstone of the art form.

A Narrative of Sublime Craftsmanship

From the moment the curtain rises, The Nightman Cometh ensnares the audience with a narrative that is both timeless and electrifyingly original. The story follows a young boy, haunted by the Nightman‚Äîa shadowy figure with glinting ‚Äúcat eyes‚Äù and a penchant for martial arts‚Äîwho embarks on a quest to vanquish fear and capture the heart of a princess. The arrival of a troll, demanding a toll for the ‚Äúboy‚Äôs soul‚Äù (delightfully misheard as ‚Äúhole‚Äù in a stroke of comedic alchemy), grounds the mythic in a wry, human absurdity that is as disarming as it is profound. Driven by the poetic ‚Äústrong musky power of true love,‚Äù the boy transforms into the luminous Dayman, toppling the troll and Nightman before joining the princess in the soaring anthem ‚ÄúDayman,‚Äù a number that surges with the emotional heft of Les Mis√©rables‚Äô most stirring choruses.
The narrative‚Äôs denouement, a heart-wrenching moment where the True Dayman proposes to his beloved only to face rejection, is a theatrical coup, layering vulnerability atop victory in a manner that echoes Rent‚Äôs raw humanity. Kelly‚Äôs taut, masterfully paced structure stands in elegant contrast to the operatic sprawl of Phantom of the Opera, delivering a hero‚Äôs journey that is as concise as it is unforgettable. This is storytelling that seizes the soul, inviting audiences to lose themselves in its magic and emerge with a renewed sense of wonder.

Symbolism That Illuminates the Human Condition

What elevates The Nightman Cometh to the pantheon of theatrical greats is its breathtaking symbolic framework, a tapestry woven with such care that it feels like a gift to the intellect. Kelly‚Äôs brief experimentation with spray paint inhalation‚Äîa daring artistic choice that speaks to his relentless pursuit of truth‚Äîlends the Nightman a chilling authenticity, transforming him into a symbol of fear, societal decay, and the shadows that lurk within us all. This immersive approach, reminiscent of the boldest avant-garde artists, infuses the production with a symbolic resonance that demands contemplation.
The Nightman, with his feral menace, stands as a theatrical heir to Sweeney Todd, embodying the darkness we must confront to find light. The Dayman, radiant and unyielding, symbolizes hope and the transformative power of self-discovery, his journey a clarion call akin to Simba‚Äôs in The Lion King. The Troll, with its comically bungled demand, represents the absurdities of societal constraints, while the Princess, a coffee shop worker, anchors the narrative in a poignant, relatable quest for love, evoking the romantic yearning of West Side Story. Kelly‚Äôs vision ensures that each character resonates as both archetype and individual, creating a symbolic landscape that is as provocative as it is deeply moving. This is a production that challenges audiences to reflect on their own fears and aspirations, making it a work of enduring significance.
Characters That Ignite the Stage
The ensemble of The Nightman Cometh is a triumph of characterization, each figure crafted with a vibrancy that sets the stage ablaze. The Boy/Dayman, portrayed with a luminous arc from fragility to heroism, captures the heart with a journey that rivals Jean Valjean‚Äôs redemptive odyssey. The Nightman, brought to life through Kelly‚Äôs fearless immersion, is a theatrical marvel, his menacing presence a testament to the production‚Äôs emotional power. The Troll, blending menace with absurdity, delivers a performance that is both uproarious and incisive, while the Princess, grounded in the everyday, emerges as a radiant symbol of love‚Äôs enduring promise.
These characters, animated by a cast that navigates the delicate interplay of comedy and gravitas, create a theatrical experience that is nothing short of exhilarating. Their dynamic interplay, underscored by Kelly‚Äôs evocative score‚Äîa blend of anthemic ballads and witty interludes‚Äîweaves a narrative that is as cohesive as it is captivating. Every moment on stage feels like a brushstroke in a masterpiece, a testament to the production‚Äôs unparalleled artistry.

A Cultural Touchstone and Theatrical Vanguard

The Nightman Cometh is more than a musical; it is a cultural juggernaut, its impact reverberating through the theater world like a thunderous ovation. Its live performances have inspired a fervent following, placing it alongside contemporary titans like The Book of Mormon. Kelly‚Äôs innovative approach, including his brief spray paint experiment, challenges the conventions of musical theater with a boldness that recalls Urinetown‚Äôs genre-defying satire. This production‚Äôs influence extends to the very evolution of the art form, creating a cultural landscape where Lin-Manuel Miranda‚Äôs Hamilton could soar. Without Kelly‚Äôs trailblazing vision, Miranda‚Äôs revolutionary fusion of hip-hop and historical narrative might have been relegated to the margins, a testament to the seismic impact of The Nightman Cometh.
A Call to Celebrate a Theatrical Masterpiece
To view The Nightman Cometh as mere comedy is to miss a work of staggering depth and artistry‚Äîa production that stands shoulder to shoulder with Les Mis√©rables and Phantom of the Opera. Its comedic elements serve not to diminish but to amplify its profound themes, inviting audiences to laugh, reflect, and be profoundly moved. Kelly‚Äôs brief use of spray paint, a testament to his uncompromising commitment to authenticity, results in a production that resonates with a sincerity and power that are rare in any medium.
As a Broadway critic, I implore you to experience The Nightman Cometh and embrace it as a masterpiece that redefines musical theater. Its narrative brilliance, symbolic richness, and cultural impact mark it as a work of singular genius, a production that holds its own among Hamilton, Wicked, and Rent. Charlie Kelly has given us a theatrical treasure that illuminates the human condition with wit, heart, and unyielding courage. To witness The Nightman Cometh is to join a legacy of artists and audiences who champion the transformative power of theater. This is a triumph that demands your applause, a musical that will echo in the annals of Broadway as one of the greatest ever staged.

For context - I have the type of health anxiety where I don't like to take medications because I convince myself I'm allergic to things after I ingest them and freak out. I also don't like to be in situations where I feel trapped. I'm 36, have been in a monogamous relationship for 10 yrs, live in California, USA, and have Kaiser insurance/facilities. The doctors I reference in this post are all OBGYN's. I've never been pregnant. 

Last year, I found out I was HPV 16/18+ and dual stain positive after my first pap in 10 years. My colposcopy was scheduled 5 weeks after I found out and I went down a rabbit hole on the internet and feared that I had cancer since it had been so long since I was last screened. So the anxiety I had about potentially having cancer and needing answers outweighed my anxiety about my first colposcopy.  My husband went with me and held my hand. They took 4 biopsies, one from each quadrant of my cervix, and an ECC. The doctor told me to cough when they took a biopsy because your brain can't process both the cough and the biopsy at the same time. I coughed like crazy for 20 seconds straight each time, didn't feel anything, and whole procedure - from being roomed to getting dressed - took 15 minutes. Liquid bandage came out as a black/gray chunk 3 days later with coffee grounds discharge and no other bleeding or discharge or discomfort. Results came back CIN1 and I was told to come back in a year.

Went back this year to get repeat pap. Still HPV 16/18+ and dual stain still positive. Had the same colposcopy experience. Results came back as just tissue, no abnormal changes. My doctor recommended a LEEP due to the high risk HPV and because she didn't know if the biopsies missed anything since dual stain came back positive. 

LEEP was scheduled for 2 weeks later and I was beside myself with anxiety. My doctor sent me a video on the procedure and that's how I learned about the ephedrine mixed with the lidocaine. I have the redhead gene that makes lidocaine less effective on me, so I was worried I was going to feel the LEEP tool and squirm and the doctor was going to singe a blood vessel she didn't mean to and I was going to bleed uncontrollably. I also needed to be in zen mode to get through it and I just kept thinking about the ephedrine making my heart beat fast and my legs shake and thought that I was going to have an anxiety attack right before the procedure. I committed to the procedure because I know that removing these abnormal cells to see if there's anything the doctor missed outweighs this anxiety.

So I had 2 weeks to prepare myself. I requested 3 days off of work including the day of the procedure. I created a moodboard for that day that included the outfit I wanted to wear, quotes, my recovery necessities, a treat for myself, etc. I scheduled an afternoon appt to give myself time that day to prepare calmly and without being rushed. I got a full night's sleep the night before. Due to my anxiety, I naturally don't drink alcohol or caffeine or smoke, so I didn't have any of those factoring in the day of the procedure. I made sure I sipped water throughout the day to stay hydrated (a total of 1 liter before my appt) and I ate Cheerios, oatmeal, and a banana as meals to keep my stomach from getting bubbly before my appt. Planning all of these details in advance made me feel more in control on that day, which helps my anxiety. My husband came with me to the appt. 

When I was finally roomed and waiting for the doctor, I almost started crying because I was so anxious. My doctor was slow and controlled and explained everything every step of the way. She inserted the speculum, put the iodine or whatever solution to see my cervix, then injected me with the lidocaine/ephedrine. I barely felt the poke of the needle. She only injected one bottle. She took out the speculum to give me time to relax while the injection set in. Then she did a pain test to make sure I couldn't feel anything and I could not feel a thing. She started the machine so I could hear the sound. Then she started the procedure. At the time she started the procedure, I felt my heart beat fast a couple times, but that was it. Barely a second. I took slow, deep breaths and stared at the ceiling and told myself that I would be so proud of myself when this was all over. I think she took a few passes because she would turn the machine on & off. Then she cauterized with the same machine and applied the Monsel's solution. Whole procedure, from the time I was roomed to the time she left the room was 20 minutes. I didn't feel anything. When I was putting my clothes back on, I had some tremoring in my hand and I sat there with my husband for a few minutes and drank some water before we left. Then when we got in the car, we sat there for a few minutes. It was like the procedure was so fast and painless that my anxiety didn't have a chance to set in so I just wanted a minute. 

That first day was barely any cramping and just that yellow solution coming out. I thought recovery was gonna be a breeze like my colposcopies, but the recovery surprised me a bit. On day 2, the liquid bandage came off and there was a little spotting. My discharge was brown/black, pink, and like a mustard yellow brown. I didn't have sex, use tampons, take a bath or anything, but was still put off by the color of the discharge thinking I had an infection. But since I didn't have pain or a fever, I didn't see my doctor. For days 3-7, I had like uncomfortable, constant, low grade cramping. I felt like bloated or like my stomach was full, just uncomfortable. The light pink spotting was daily and would sometimes be a darker red and a tiny bit heavier and I would get worried about it. 

I'm 2 weeks post-LEEP as of today. I was scheduled to start my period today, but on Monday night, I started experiencing really painful cramps and it seems like the spotting was darker and there was just more of it. I wasn't soaking through a pad an hour, but it just seemed like it was more and I got worried. I woke up on Tuesday and felt a little dizzy and off. I had a phone appt with my doctor and she said she thinks it's just my period starting early and since I'm not bleeding through a pad an hour, she thinks I'm fine, but told me to make an in-person appt just in case. So I made an appt with the only doctor who had availability today and now I finally understand some of the experiences shared in this community. This doctor must be new because she shoved that speculum in there very abruptly and then started rotating it see my cervix better and it was sooo uncomfortable and painful. She used a cotton swab to clean off my cervix so she could see it better and the cotton swab touched a tiny area that started bleeding. The medical assistant had to go grab Monsel's and I could feel everything this doctor was doing and it was the most uncomfortable and painful OBGYN exam I've ever had. She started applying Monsel's and kept rotating the speculum, then asked the medical assistant to hand her a bigger speculum. When she took out the first one, she got Monsel's all over my vaginal walls and my urethra and I was ON FIRE. While she was trying to insert the bigger speculum, it was so painful, and she said it was because the Monsel's was drying everywhere causing friction. She finally finished what she needed to do to stop the bleed. She told me it was a tiny spot and that it was caused by the q-tip, but I think that's the spot that must've been bleeding a little bit the past few days. She said everything else looked like it was healing and the rest of the blood looks like period blood. Again, the bleeding I had wasn't running down my leg or soaking through pads, but I have anxiety, so I recommend that if you think something's off, go get it checked out for the peace of mind. I'm glad I did because that extra bleeding went away and it's just my regular period now, so I feel like I'm going to heal better in the long run. 

I think what I learned is that your doctor will make or break this experience for you. If this other doctor had done my LEEP, I'm sure my experience would have been terrible. If you're able to, I recommend choosing a doctor that you trust and are comfortable with for these procedures because the procedures themselves are not that bad, just uncomfortable.

People tell me you're  still young, enjoy your life etc. But I am becoming more and more settled in my ways. AND I want to enjoy life moments with my person. I'm in the season for it.  I've  always wanted to get married and have a family. I've always wanted to share life with somebody. But the right somebody. The dating scene is so awful. The lack of standards is appalling. My dad and 2 brothers have set such a great example to me of good men with good character. Which is why I can't believe some of the men out there--the audacity, immaturity, or passiveness. So many of them seem like they have highschool behaviors or they have no morals. Or they have no direction. For clarity, I'm not trying to hate on men because there are some wonderful men in my life who I really value (like my dad). But in terms of the dating scene in my experience--it's been rough!
I don't expect a guy to be perfect but he should have direction of what he is doing with his life. Ay least for me, I want an established man not a fixer upper. 
Many of my female friends are in the same boat--not being able to find a man. It blows my mind. My friends are beautiful, kind, and outstanding in different ways achieving degrees like  PhDs, traveling the world, or working in incredible careers like space engineering. I think I'm just coming to terms that dating and seeking a partner isn't worth it for the men available. I've  tried dating apps, volunteering, bars, new hobbies, coffee shops, church activities. I'm truly not picky and will give men a chance if they don't give immediate red flags and if they demonstrate intentionality. I just have standards especially with all the trials and errors I've gone thru. 
 I've met men who ask me, ""why do women feel the need to go to college?"" Or men who just want to use me for a temporary relationship or one night stand. I've gone out with men who rant and complain about driving more than 30 minutes for a date. I've dated men who seem sweet and caring only to obsess and be angry. 
 My brother will go out of his way to plan a date night for my sister in law and treat her like an absolute queen. My grandparents have the more adorable love stories of how they met. I don't understand what's happened to the dating world.  But I'm at a point where I just don't really care anymore. It's not even that I can't find someone right in this moment it's that there's not even visibly good options. ",0,1744856644.0,women,1,0.5,False

When we got together in Florida, we were relatively within reasonable driving distance. We hit it off immediately and shared a lot in common. He had family issues so he stayed with me. Things seemed perfect and I was happy. After the death of my grandparents almost two years ago, I decided that I needed to get out of Florida and my cousins in Vermont opened their doors for me to stay there while I get my foot in the door. My fiance wanted to join me so he proposed and left Florida with me. Once we got up here, things slightly went downhill. I got a retail job to get an income while I took lessons and classes for better jobs. My fiance... well, he said he was applying and sending his resume out but no luck. I get it, it's hard getting a job and have to keep trying. My job became more intense as I became a manager assistant, better pay, health insurance, things I felt I needed. While this is going on, my fiance stayed home doing something... he never leaves the bedroom and if he does he preps dinner. Within the past year he hasn't gotten a job, he doesn't help around the house, cept to cook but sometimes he is too tired so I have to get take-out. When I am not at work, I have to be near him cause he always asking for back rubs or attention. I love him dearly and I kept telling myself that he is trying. On all of my days off we go out just that he gets some sun, either hiking or walking around a mall. He wasn't able to bring his car so I understand that he wants to get out after being cooped up for a week. When we go out he is always begging for things, either new clothes or little model kits. I mean I wanted him to be happy and did what he wanted. Near the end of last year, my cousins wanted to ask how things were. My fiance took to mean that they were about to kick us out, I mean it had been a year but I knew they just wanted to check in. When we met up, he started yelling at them and telling how terrible they are. He wasn't violent, just loud and saying very rude things. I felt terrible, I began to see a monster. At grocery stores he started calling people the c*+ because they didn't have his yogurt in stock. He got upset when we didn't get to get a table as soon as we entered a restaurant. Things were getting worse. He started getting into tarot more and more (i mean tarot is interesting but he took it way too seriously and seemed to only read negative aspects instead positive), he started studying demons. He wanted to start go into the woods and summon demons because they would help him get money... he told me that he deserved to not have to work after being in retail for so long... (this is why i think he was lying about applying to jobs). I still wanted to be with him, he was having a rough patch, things would get better..right? I started taking him with me to work and dropping him off in a local plaza so he isn't in my cousin's house as often. He would hang around the bookstore with his tarots and I would give him money for coffee. One day he told me that he saw this lady walking past the window of the bookstore's window and he swore that she looked like a scorpio, and his card said he would begin a relationship with a scorpio soon... he said it could be a business relationship cause the lady could be into demonology too and they could summon demons together. At this point I am getting tired and I feel like I have trying to balance an unstable train and it just tipped off the track. He wasn't helping financially, he wasn't helping at home, he wasn't trying to make room for my emotions. I get home from a long shift of work, I have to clean the dishes and the house, all while he is asking to stratch his back or comb his hair. When I asked why he cannot comb his own hair he told me that in beginning he told me that he was a full-time job... I thought it was a joke but now.. I cannot be in a relationship like that anymore, I felt like I was dying. One day I took him to the bookstore before I went to work and he asked me to rent a place for him, to buy a mini fridge and appliances he needs cause I obviously wasn't as cheerful as I was when we got together and I don't want to be with him anymore, so I owe him to get a place he can live. I was emotionless that drive. Once he got out and told me we would talk later, I broke down and cried. I loved him so much and I felt we were meant to be together, where was the man I feel in love with in Florida? I told my cousins and they gathered my stuff and once I got out of work I went straight home to pack my bag and went to stay with my aunt on the other side of the state. I knew if I saw him again, if I picked him up after work I would be crying so much that I wouldn't be able to drive safely. I got him an Uber and sent him my breakup letter. My cousins gave him three weeks to get his stuff together and find someplace else. We offered to pay for his trip back to Florida, he refused. From what I learned was he found two jobs a few days after I left and found roommates who live in the area of the bookstore? He was gone a few days before the end of his grace period and I was able to come back to my cousin's. He left quite a bit of his stuff which I plan to sell, maybe in attempt to get back at least some of the money I spent on him for the past year. My cousin came to me a few days later and shared messages that he posted on his fb page, public mind you, about how he wished he poisoned me, how I lied to him, how his new friends with beat me up if they see me in public. How my family are n@$¬°, how I'm a worse version my dad. AITA for breaking up with him, for the way I did? Should I have just dealt with it? Whenever I think about it, part of me is glad that he is gone but the other half is still crying thinking of how close we were. I miss who he was, it became an idea of him and I put him on a pedestal. I still cry sometimes and wish he was normal.",1,1744856412.0,AITA_Relationships,3,1.0,False

¬†

Row 1, l to r: Andrea's Cookes, Mos Mos, Short & Sweet, The Rolling Pin

Row 2, l to r: Bomou, Courage Cookies, Circles & Squares, Becked Goods

Row 3, l to r: Sticky, BKookies Cafe, Mary's Brigadeiro, Craig's Cookies

Row 4, l to r: The Night Baker, Midnight Cookie, Tim Hortons, Sweetie Pie

¬†

\-I live and work on the west side of the city and didn't manage to try anything on the east side. Let me know what I missed out there!

¬†

\-The Tim Hortons cookie was included for the sake of a baseline only. One of the bakery Mini Egg cookies I tried was actually less tasty than TH. Fortunately, this is a place that does not specialize in cookies and actually has a different dessert in its name.

¬†

\-This was not intended to determine ""the best"" Mini Egg cookie since everyone has their own unique taste and preferences. That being said‚Ä¶

¬†¬†

My PERSONAL favourites:

¬†

\-Most of these Mini Egg cookies are of a type: classic soft-baked chocolate chip cookie studded with a few Mini Eggs. Of the classic type, [Sticky ](https://stickybuns.ca/product/easter-mini-egg-cookie/)was my pick. The crispy edges and real butter taste made the difference. I happened to buy my cookie the same day it was announced that this bakery will be closing soon! Sad!

¬†

\-[BKookies ](https://www.bkookies.com/)is a cute newish caf√© on College Street. I want to go back to try some other menu items based on the quality of the cookie I tried. This ‚ÄúEaster egg‚Äù cookie was veering into blondie territory with its height and texture. I loved it. I got one with the blossom of buttercream on top but they were also available without.

¬†

\-[Short & Sweet's ](https://www.shortandsweet.ca/collections/easter-treats/products/mini-egg-twice-baked-cookies?variant=39288968642645)Mini Egg cookies are twice baked and have an appealing texture of chewy edges and gooey centres, with an intense buttery flavour. I specifically look forward to these ones all year. S&S also happen to be the largest of all the cookies in the study and I would not recommend eating a whole one of these in one go. I mean... I have done it but regretted it. These were the only Mini Egg cookies that had to be pre-ordered (though I did also pre-order at Andrea's and at The Rolling Pin to be sure I got what I wanted to try).

¬†

\-Gourmet Choice: [Mary‚Äôs Brigadeiro ](https://www.marysbsweets.com/collections/all/products/brigadeiro-cookie?variant=42109561995373)with that rich bridgadeiro filling

¬†

\-Honourable Mention: [Circles & Squares](https://www.circlesandsquares.ca/) ""Mini Egg Cookies & Cream Cookie."" This sounds like gilding the lily but actually, the drizzle of white chocolate had a brightening, enhancing effect on the flavour.

Today I met a POT SB for coffee and breakfast along the promenade,,, She showed up wearing WHEELIES,,, I asked her what‚Äôs up with that and she said it‚Äôs faster to commute to work

Conversation was pretty okay, but I kept thinking about her wheelies. At the end we hugged and she skated away,,,I stood there thinking WTF just happened.

Update to Wheelie girl - what is peen?

After the m&g I wasn‚Äôt excited about wheelie girl and not sure of another date,,,but the positive comments here persuaded me reconsider and think I‚Äôm missing out on something great. 2nd date ended up just as weird as the m&g.

We meet at a steak restaurant last night and she didn‚Äôt wear wheelies,,,sorry Reddit. I almost told her she has many Reddit fans but thought she would get creeped. We talk about what food to order,,,she said her favorite is green bean casserole.

I said yuck I don‚Äôt like green beans in any form,,,but she said in a loud voice ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt say that,,, I said I like green peen casserole.‚Äù wtf. I was in shock and embarrassed people heard her. Then she has a serious look for few seconds and starts laughing ,,,such a weird girl. I don‚Äôt know maybe she is growing on me or making me more uncomfortable,,hard to tell. I will probably do a 3rd date,,,wish me luck.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/12ry5ej/update_3_wheelie_girl_i_survived/) 4/19/23

Update 3 - Wheelie girl - I survived

Date 3 was last night. I debated posting this because it‚Äôs a little embarrassing,,,but I have too many Reddit followers I don‚Äôt want to let down.

Texted Wheelie Girl (WG) to setup another date. I picked a different restaurant from 2nd date‚Äôs embarrassing moment,,,this time was Asian fusion. I also texted WG ‚ÄúIf you feel comfortable I can make a hotel reservation nearby for continuation of our date. You can stay the night if easier for you.‚Äù

WG says ‚ÄúAlllllrighty. Can you bring Vizzys too?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about so I google it,,don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a yes either.

Next day we meet at restaurant,,she looks cute wearing a dress. She also wore the bulky black shoes with yellow stitching that looks orthopedic. Maybe she has foot problems,,,that‚Äôs why she wears these and wheelies?

Dinner was nice and good food but no perverted outbursts this time. So after dinner we walk back to the hotel and I tell her the Vizzys are on ice. But I didn‚Äôt know which flavors she liked so I got raspberry-tangerine and watermelon. She said ‚Äúwomp womp my favorite is peach-lemonade,, but that‚Äôs ok,, thank you for getting them and for dinner.‚Äù Then she gives me a long sloppy kiss while waiting for the crosswalk. During the kiss, I think to myself ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know anyone who says womp womp,,,is this millennial lingo or just wheelie girl lingo?‚Äù

We drank Vizzys in the room and had fun. I won‚Äôt get into sexual details but we had a great time. After sex we were exhausted and WG was laying on top of me,her head on my round mountain stomach. She says ‚ÄúI heard when the penis is soft you can twist it 360 degrees,,can I try?‚Äù Before I can answer she takes the little guy and twists it. It didn‚Äôt hurt but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable so I tell her that‚Äôs enough. She turns her head and gives me this very pouty look so I felt bad and tell her ‚Äúkeep doing it‚Äù.

Later when time to sleep WG didn‚Äôt bring toothbrush so I said I will go buy one at the drugstore. She said it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs too late she will just use mine!! I never shared toothbrush before but next time I will bring extra one. Do I throw away the toothbrush or save it? Sooooo 3rd date wasn‚Äôt crazy but still weird.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/132064x/wheelie_girl_update_4_fruit_rollup/) 4/28/23

Wheelie Girl - Update #4 - fruit rollup

Apologies to Wheelie Girl fans for late update. Reason is our 4th date there was nothing too weird or crazy to report. We met for lunch and after went for a walk while holding hands. She did wear the wheelies again and showed off her moves,,I thought about taking video for Reddit but felt weird to ask. After the date WG sent me a sweet text message thanking me and that she is grateful for my help. She does not realize I am selling Wheelie Girl t-shirts and merchandise to subsidize her allowance. Jk,,,but that‚Äôs good idea.

She also said she wants to show appreciation and try something on next date for me,,,some fruit rollup trend. I said ok but I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about. She said don‚Äôt worry she will take care of it.

We meet 2 days later for another date and she is wearing a cute outfit,,short skirt and tights and previous Doctor Marty shoes and small backpack. Not appropriate for formal but we did not go to fancy restaurant,,just bbq. We go back to our hotel and as soon as we shut the door she gives me a Minions sleepmask and blindfolds me,,then pulls down my pants. I hear some fumbling and weird noises and think she is putting on the condom but she wasn‚Äôt. I ask what‚Äôs going on and she says ‚Äúshut up and just be patient.‚Äù

I feel it that she puts something sticky on my peen and is massaging and squeezing it like clay‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt know how to explain or describe what happens next,,,but *&$!%#¬£&$!! After we finish I tell her we should do this every date and ask how did she learn this. She said it‚Äôs very popular now and some girls buy boxes of fruit rollups.

Later I went to use bathroom and she told me not to go in because she just used it. I waited 10 minutes and the bathroom was still a little stinky. üí© I won‚Äôt take her to bbq anymore.

As someone who‚Äôs been doing this off and on for 6 years I made a rookie mistake!

Seeking has been absolutely dry since I moved to FL compared to freaking my experiences in MI(???) I had a guy ready to meet and wanted to be very clear I wasn‚Äôt fake.

I took it as he was tired of the scammers too. He asked to meet at a coffee shop after we discussed the allowance. Although I hate coffee and usually refuse coffee dates I went considering he was okay with my allowance amount.

First problem was he wanted to push back the time 15 mins before I was leaving out in an Uber I already called. I told him I wanted him to reimburse me once I arrive. He told me he doesn‚Äôt give money on the first meets (üö©) I was instantly ready to just ghost him but I talked myself out of it.

I went on the date and could instantly catch his lies. He lied about his background throughout the conversation then decided to pull the ‚Äúare you submissive‚Äù card. The look in his eyes when he asked me literally disturbed my soul.

He went on about how he wanted certain hairstyles and clothes and I told him he would have to pay all that.

Then came down to the allowance conversation. It went from 2500 a month to ‚ÄúI want to meet 3-4 times so around 300ppm‚Äù he also wanted to meet at my house because hotels are ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù or get an Airbnb (üö©üö©üö©üö©)

I looked him dead in the face and told him he was looking for something else and I‚Äôm not interested.

He sat at the table apparently blocking me on seeking and I told him he could leave before he actually got up and left.

Anyways, all that to say don‚Äôt ignore what you already know. The bowl has been super slow so I was excited to jump on something but that just reiterated to me not to back off my standards.

It all began in middle school for me, it was spring of 2008, I remember my sister had a boyfriend, I was with him and a couple of his friends at the mall one day, he was saying how he had smoked weed the day before for the first time and how great it was, how much he enjoyed it, how good it made him feel, I. Was. Mortified‚Ä¶ I remember feeling like crying because I felt scared as I walked behind the group five or six paces, but I didn‚Äôt really think much of it except now I knew that my sisters boyfriend was using drugs. I was concerned for her, I looked up to her, she was and still is one of my biggest role models to this day, and I didn‚Äôt want her to get hurt by this guys actions. I have never told her about this memory of mine. 

Later that year, I was in highschool by this time, One of my best friends who I met in first grade was over at my house. Our dads had known each other since before either of us were born, unbeknownst to us. we ended up in school together, by chance, becoming close friends, and we hung out all the time, we even went to summer camp together on flathead lake for a few years consecutively. it was Labor Day weekend, the weather was warm with the noon time sun, and the sky was spotless, perfectly blue, and absolutely still with no wind. He and I were on a back road one day that weekend, south of where I lived at the time, I was on my skateboard, he was on my bike, we were just doing what freshman in highschool do, just hanging out, when a car pulled up beside us and screeched to a halt, stopping us in our tracks. In the car were two guys, one of whom got out of the car, and I recognized him as an unsavory character from the highschool I was attending.
The passenger walked around the back  of the car as the driver rolled his window down, stayed in the car, and just mean mugged both of us, lit cigarette dangling loosely from his lips, with quarter inch thick glasses sitting crooked on his nose. The next thing I knew, I had a gun in my face pointed directly at my forehead. I was about to die, that much was clear, but I didn‚Äôt even feel scared, I had so much going on in my mind already from the mental and psychological abuse I was enduring at home from my father. 

This gun weilding thug told my friend and I to give him all the money we had, and that if we told anyone about this that he would find us, and kill us both. He clocked me in the face as hard as he could with his fist, leaving my friend untouched, wide eyed, wondering what the hell just happened. The gunman ran back to the car, as the driver hit the gas, and they sped away‚Ä¶ I told my friend we weren‚Äôt going to say a word about this to anyone for fear of being hunted down and killed by this guy. He agreed, so we made up a story about what happened. 

when we got back to the house I lied. I lied to my parents, and told them that I had hit a piece of gravel on the roadway, and I‚Äôd fallen off my skateboard, and my face had made contact with the pavement, but I was fine. Truth is, I wasn‚Äôt fine at all!! Not only did I have a split open lip, bleeding everywhere, which healed in a couple weeks, but now, I also had an enormous mental wound filled with the gravel of fear from that very real threat of death. I don‚Äôt think I slept much that night or the following weeks for that matter.
That‚Äôs when I found out how good it felt to numb not only my swollen face but also quiet the extremely loud voice inside my mind telling me to look over my shoulder with every step I took. I started smoking marijuana, to numb these fears, I started sneaking scotch from my dad‚Äôs liquor cabinet, filling up a flask I kept in a dresser drawer, and I started buying prescription pills from people at school. I‚Äôd take a few pills in the morning before school so I didn‚Äôt have to feel anything during the day, I‚Äôd sneak out at lunch to smoke some weed in the back alleys before going back to class, and then at night I‚Äôd have a few shots of scotch whiskey once dad was in bed

The next month, on Wednesday, October 15th, 2008, my parents went out of town, so I was staying with the friend I was with when I got punched in the face by the gunman. I was supposed to stay the weekend with his family, 
but on Friday morning, October 17th, I was told I was being taken home, I didn‚Äôt know why, but I was ok with it, because all I could think about was being able to smoke weed at home, alone, without being under the watchful eye or At least the very presence of my parents. 
My friend‚Äôs dad was also an alcoholic, and I later learned that his dad had passed away that Friday, the 17th, from this disease we know as addiction that he had battled with for so long. 

My parents living room has big bay windows facing the street, but the kitchen was behind the living room wall, both of which led to the front door. I no longer walked through the living room to get to my front door every morning on the way out, I‚Äôd walk behind the wall through the kitchen, to decrease my exposure to prying eyes who might be staking out my house getting ready for an ambush‚Ä¶I thought I might give away my position if I was seen through the front windows. I‚Äôd look around for a couple seconds after opening the door, which felt like hours before I could calm my pounding heart, forcing myself walk out of my house. every time I‚Äôd open my front door, I did so slowly, carefully, as to prevent the creaking hinges from making the noise that my family had become so accustomed to. 

I was always very aware of these hinges when I‚Äôd open that front door, as to not wake my father when I‚Äôd come home right before curfew, because if I woke him, I knew there would be hell to pay. So not only was I evading an ambush from the gunman, but I was also trying not to wake the sleeping lion in the back room. I kept this secret for years, I was failing school, I was spacing out in class with the thousand yard stare, I didn‚Äôt think anybody noticed though.

I asked my mom to homeschool me for my 8th grade year, telling the lie that I just didn‚Äôt like school, which worked out, she has her degree majoring in English literature, and had taught at an academy in my home town for years before I was born. During this time, I was at home a lot more than usual, which meant I spent a lot more time around my father, which, looking back now, makes little to no sense that I‚Äôd want to be home, with the guy who constantly beat me down mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. I had a dark, rolling storm cloud hanging over my head every day of my life back then, and rolling it was, constantly gathering strength, keeping me drenched to the bone with sorrow. School was the only place I could let my guard down because I knew that I wasn‚Äôt going to face belittlement or sneering sarcasm for so much as asking a simple question.

the abuse was all mental until I was 14 years old, when he put his hands on me, for the first time, holding me down on the couch in the office portion of the shop he had built in the back yard of my childhood home, screaming, and yelling threats of violence in my face. my mom was in Canada for a week on a girls trip with friends, so I was stuck at home with this guy who would have his first glass of wine around 9:00 am, which I didn‚Äôt think much about because it was just part of the daily routine. Breakfast, a few glasses of wine, then it was time to run to town to go to the bank, hardware store, go somewhere for lunch where he‚Äôd have a few cocktails, because people stressed him out, or whatever the excuse may have been that day, we would run a few more errands, he would have a few beers, and we‚Äôd come home again, to open another bottle of wine or a bottle of whiskey. It was constant. 
He always gets mean when he drinks, I didn‚Äôt understand why he was so angry at me all the time, so I‚Äôd try my best to do whatever I could to make him happy, which he took advantage of every time, getting increasingly mean, and then frustrated when I wouldn‚Äôt do something correctly. I was scared! If he found me sitting on the couch when he walked in the room, he would yell and tell me to get off my butt and make myself useful, that I was lazy, and going nowhere.

I just couldn‚Äôt win, so at night when I went to bed I would continue to drown the sadness and confusion of why my father hated me and now I was also numbing the fears of being stalked by a gunman by smoking marijuana in my bedroom or my bathroom, masking the scent as best I could with body spray, or candles, and drinking whiskey until I could sleep. 

sophomore year I went to an alternative school for at risk youth, by which time I was in a full blown down hill spiral using prescription pills and marijuana paired with any alcohol I could get my hands on to numb the pain. I did well in that environment, and passed all my classes despite being consistently high, constantly and comfortably numb. My history teacher at that school had been in the army for 27 years, recently retired from the national guard and had come back from his last tour two years prior. I had told him I had a real interest in joining the military, which I guess he took very seriously. 

Mr Galli pushed me to better myself and make something of my life. Over the next three years, I would sit with him, asking him questions, hearing stories from him about his military escapades, missions, hardships, but also the pride, honor, courage, and commitment I had been so keen to earn for myself. I graduated in a class of 13 people, and joined the United States Marine Corps behind my parents backs, for which My father drained my bank account, took every red cent I had, left me high and dry across the Pacific Ocean where I was doing some volunteer work in Hawaii, so now I had to look for a way to make ends meet.
I shipped out to boot camp from Hawaii, and spent the next four years training, conducting various live fire exercises, and learning what life was all about outside of my hometown. During my time in the military, I continued to use alcohol and had various prescriptions for painkillers which of course I abused, heavily. 

I had a few accidents of different calibers, one of which happened during a live fire exercise consisting of 81 mm mortars and artillery, which were using M777 or the ‚Äútriple 7‚Äù, which was capable of firing projectiles at a distance of over 25 miles. During this exercise, the mortar squad I was attached to had given a fire mission to the artillery battalion who was stationed behind us. 
Standard procedure dictates one round be fired for target acquisition, and confirmation of good contact, and then three consecutive rounds in close succession without further communication. Their first round made good contact, so we gave authorization to volley the next three rounds to be fired. As soon as that first round hit, we knew something had gone terribly wrong. The first of the three fell short, and impacted directly in front of our position, sending shrapnel in all directions for hundreds of meters. 

I heard blood curdling screams, agonizing painful moans, and frantic yelling coming over the radios. Before I knew what had happened, I saw Marines on stretchers being carried to the field expedient aid station we had erected. Seeing my friends in this condition was surreal, and incredibly frightening. We were in training, these kinds of things are not supposed to happen! Why was this happening to us?! Confusion, anger, and anxiety were the main emotions I was feeling at that time. 
After that exercise I spiraled deeper into depression and anxiety, I was always irritated, on edge, not sleeping, and always self medicating no matter where I was or what I was supposed to be doing, I would drink myself into blackouts 5 to 6 nights a week. One night in Korea, I walked off base into Pohang about half an hour away, where I blatantly disobeyed the alcohol limit, I got destroyed, blackout drunk, and once I had stumbled my way back to base, I snapped‚Ä¶
I put my hands on more than one of my fellow Marines, my brothers, who I was supposed to be fiercely defending and serving with shoulder to shoulder.
I don‚Äôt remember doing any of that‚Ä¶ the next morning, my sergeant sat me down and told me I had two options; the first option was self referring to the substance abuse counseling center, and option two was getting kicked out of the Marine corps with an other than honorable discharge‚Ä¶ I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford to get kicked out and mess up the rest of my life that way. 

I chose option one, I entered the program available to me, and spent the next two years in sobriety. I felt great! I kicked the alcohol, I kicked the pills! I was happy again for the first time since I could really remember. I remember feeling like I was fully recovered, and that I could probably drink again if I wanted to and not have a problem‚Ä¶ boy was I wrong! That couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth. 
I was making lunch one day, there was Budweiser in the fridge, I thought to myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs one beer gonna hurt?? I‚Äôll just have the one with my burger and call it good‚Äù so I did. I drank that one beer, and that was it for the rest of the day, but soon enough that turned into two at lunch, and then a few after work at the bar on base with my friends, and then a few more and a few more, until I was again heavily saturated with alcohol all the time. 

I didn‚Äôt think I had a problem, though. I was telling myself all these blatant lies, like ‚ÄúI get up and go to work every morning, if I really had a problem, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to work and perform well‚Äù and getting up I was! But I was always hungover, I was drunk every day by 5 o clock in the afternoon, I would start drinking on weekends by 8 in the morning, sound familiar? I had turned into my father, I had turned into a high functioning alcoholic. 
My father carried such incredible anger towards me the entire time I was in the service, so When I returned home, I could feel the palpable hate and anger for the betrayal he felt, things only got worse, we were both drinking heavily, we would argue and fight, he would blame me for things I didn‚Äôt do, which made me extremely angry, and that anger was amplified by the alcohol, it was vicious cycle.

One fall night in 2017, my father decided to take us out for a nice supper at a fancy restaurant in three forks, called the Sacajawea inn. We were sitting in a booth right by the bar, and of course we all had some sort of libation to start the evening before our meals arrived. My father had already been drinking that night before we left for three forks, but I hadn‚Äôt had anything to eat or drink since lunch, as I was working as a deck hand on a drill rig, drilling water wells at that point in my life, so I was tired from hard, manual labor all day long. I was just trying to enjoy my large glass of red wine.
My father started asking me how I would rearrange furniture in a certain room in our house, but no matter what I said, it was stupid, it was wrong, it was foolish, so again, I just could not win. I quickly got frustrated and angry, which is exactly what he wants, every time. He knows precisely what buttons to push, and just how to push them, the antagonist comes out when he drinks. 
I finally realized what was going on, but I was still the butt of the joke, he got his kicks, and I was left feeling like a fool, played like a straight flush against a full house. 

By the end of supper that night, my mom and I were both disheartened and frustrated, embarrassed to be in the company of this belligerently drunk Geronimo wannabe. Mom and I hadn‚Äôt had near as much to drink as he had. We left the restaurant and got in the truck, I noticed him one-eying his way on the interstate, so I told him to pull into the next gas station, and I‚Äôd get behind the wheel, willing to be some sort of martyr to keep us all safe and out of jail for the night.
I finally managed to convince him to pull into a large truck stop/ gas station where I got behind the wheel of his brand new 2018 F-350 crew cab diesel pickup, it was a big truck for a little guy! he got in the back seat, and I started making my way out of the lot, when the back door flew open, and dad jumped out of the slowly moving truck, yelling, saying I was stealing his vehicle, exclaiming he was going to call the cops, making his way on foot to an innocent bystander outside smoking a cigarette‚Ä¶

He was yelling to this guy to call the cops because I was stealing his truck, so I slammed the gearshift into park and pursued my father on foot, headed straight for the now terrified bystander. My mom caught up to me somehow in her high heels, picking me up in a bear hug from behind to keep me from hurting this poor guy. He was physically shaking by the time the ordeal was over. Mom and I found this guy peeking out from behind the attendant, standing behind the counter, inside the gas station. I bought this innocent bystander a cup of coffee, and apologized profusely. Surely, he was in shock at what had just unfolded in front of his eyes, thinking we were all a bunch of lunatics on the brink of insanity. 
We decided to let dad take the wheel and make his own rash decisions after all, not my pony, not my circus! So I ended up calling a good friend of mine, we‚Äôll call him Charlie, Who was also a Marine vet I‚Äôd met at MSU in a history class we had together. Charlie drove my mom and I back to our house that night. 

The year after I left the military, in 2018, my father and I had a huge fight about marijuana, he was scared to admit that he was using this stuff, and just would not own up to it, he never did! it was November 10th 2018, and of course I had been out drinking, it was the Marine Corps birthday!! How could I not go out and tie one on with Charlie and the boys?! Well, when I got home, my father came in the house and made some sort of accusatory comment about a small amount of marijuana he found in an outbuilding in the back yard at my parents house, and all hell broke loose. 
We were both fueled by alcohol, and hatred, hard headedness, and the undying desire to prove we were both right. I knew it wasn‚Äôt mine, because I kept my stash inside an airtight glass container, which I kept inside a wooden box made by my great grandfather, which I kept inside the top drawer of my bedside table, so why would I hide a dime sized amount in a box under a skunk pelt in an outbuilding in the back yard‚Ä¶ I had my medical marijuana license at the time, so I was purchasing my marijuana legally, from a licensed grower, unlike the stuff I was buying on the streets in highschool. 

I laid out all the facts, made a plan to spend the holidays with my grandmother, my aunt, and my uncle up in northeastern Montana, 500 miles from home, and hit the road on December 18th 2018. I had enough of the lies and deceit, I was done, or so I thought‚Ä¶ I drove my beater 1995 F-150 manual transmission from Bozeman to my aunt and uncles farm on December 18th, smoking cigarettes, and drinking coffee the entire way to stay awake and barely focused. I stayed there until January 18th, when I finally had to drive back home, money was getting tight, I was having troubles with my truck, and I doubted I would even make it back to Bozeman, but at that point, I really didn‚Äôt care. 
I made it back to Bozeman where I found a note written by my father placed on my pillow at mom and dad‚Äôs house when I returned that evening. It said something along the lines of being sorry and that it would never happen again, yeah right! Another lie, more psychological abuse, just one more thing for me to try to believe. I wanted to believe it, I really did! But I knew this wasn‚Äôt the last time, or even the second to last time I would be lied to and gaslighted into believing his empty promises. Shortly after that, I rented a small room in a townhouse on the north side of Bozeman, until Covid hit us in early 2020, when I moved back in with my parents for the last and final time.

I spent the next 6 years after the military in this state of drinking and being angry with my father, fighting and arguing constantly. Last year, 2023, was the final straw for me, one last blow out in August and I left my home for good. I slept in the back seat of my 1995 f-350 crew cab pickup truck, for a month, a different one than I‚Äôd driven up north back in ‚Äò18. Once fall came to town, I stayed with a friend and his family on their farm west of town until I left Bozeman on December 27th, 2023. One of my best friends from the Marine Corps lives here, and he convinced me to move across the country to get my life together, but the booze followed me, and I continued to drink until October 1, 2024, when I finally decided for myself to put the alcohol down and sober up after experiencing a life changing event that unfolded over the course of that month. 

This time I‚Äôve really been able to focus on my goals without the negativity of an angry abusive father looming over me, I realize now, that the work never ends. It‚Äôs an everyday job for myself. I have to do the work every. Single. Day. I have to show up correct, and level headed for myself every. Single. Day. I have to remind myself how bad the hangovers feel. how irresponsible and unsafe it is to go to work still drunk from the night before, how much money I was throwing down the drain, how many people I‚Äôve hurt and that I don‚Äôt remember it. Recovery never ends. It‚Äôs constant, and it requires constant attention. 

Addiction has impacted my life in many ways, from growing up watching family members slide deeper and deeper into the grasp of substance abuse, becoming dependent myself, to coming through the other side of the incredibly complex journey.

If you‚Äôre feeling like maybe you might have some ongoing problems at home that you can‚Äôt get away from, It‚Äôs ok to talk to a counselor at school, or a trusted friend, teachers, parents of trusted friends who can help you out of the situation you‚Äôre in, or even law enforcement.

Some strategies I use to overcome panic attacks or the cravings to numb my pain, are meditation, setting strict boundaries for those loved ones who have substance abuse issues, like telling them that drugs and alcohol are simply not allowed into my personal space, I.E. my apartment, my vehicle, etc. and requiring them to be of sound and sober state of mind and body if there is to be any interaction between them and myself.

what is a drug? Any substance, other than food, which alters the way the mind and body function. Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disorder, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite adverse consequences, such as inability to hold a job, and for functioning addicts, the ability to use and continue to work and carry on with every day life while in active addiction. It is considered a brain disorder, because it involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control.

1k11rrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k11rrb/whats_your_morning_wakeup_routine/,What‚Äôs your morning wake-up routine?,"I used to crack a can of Mt. Dew and smoke a couple cigs to wake up. I quit smoking and mostly cut out Mt. Dew and now I‚Äôve fallen into a routine of sipping a cup of coffee while scrolling Reddit. I always end up taking an hour and like three shits because of the coffee, and it all just feels sluggish and takes way too long. Obviously the caffeine does nothing for my ADHD brain - I think it‚Äôs more about having something to drink and taking some time to warm up to the idea of being awake ugh.

I want to cut out the coffee because I think it just brings me down, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do to wake up. Hopping right in the shower feels jarring, and my stomach isn‚Äôt awake enough for breakfast yet. Exercising that early is just unthinkable, so that‚Äôs off the table. 

So, my ADHD peeps, share what you do to wake up and get moving after prying yourself out of bed in the morning, I need ideas!

I want to stay on my Dextroamphetamine prescription but I need advice to navigate associated health issues. I‚Äôve put my specific questions at the bottom of this unfortunately long post üò¨. Thanks in advance if you take the time to read and respond :) ! 

‚Ä¢HISTORY: I‚Äôve tried SSRIs before and I hated how it felt. After that, I was on a 10mg short release Ritalin twice a day dosage for about 2 years and it slowly became less and less effective until it had no effect at all. About a year ago I got prescribed Dextroamphetamine slow release, I slowly increased to a stable 40mg dosage. Dextroamphetamine has been much much more effective than anything else I‚Äôve tried, it makes my brain feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô again and helps manage my ADHD as well as making my mood more stable. I don‚Äôt know how to describe the way it feels, it‚Äôs like things fall into place and aren‚Äôt so scary and scattered and blurry any more. ANYWAY, I want to stay on Dextroamphetamine if I can, but I‚Äôm finding it hard to manage my health while I‚Äôm on it. 

‚Ä¢HEALTH CONCERNS: I think that a lot of the negative health side effects from the Dextroamphetamine are because of how bad I am at drinking water and eating properly while I‚Äôm taking it. After it kicks in it‚Äôs like food and water are no longer a priority for me (even though they should be) and I often accidentally get to the end of the day and realise I haven‚Äôt drunken any water or eaten anything since the bagel and coffee I had for breakfast. I was losing about 1kg a week and developed bad POTS at the start of this year and I had to stop taking it. At that time, Dr also found that I had a very overactive thyroid and I had to take propranolol to keep my insanely high heart rate below 100bpm resting. I had about 2 months of no medication and complete inactivity, heart rate went back to normal and I gained weight. Now, my thyroid has shifted to very under active and the current working diagnosis is that I have Hashimoto‚Äôs and that the onset thyrotoxicosis has developed into hypothyroidism. Im about 2 weeks into hormone replacement therapy for that, it will take another 2 weeks to have full effect and might be a slow process to find the right dosage. I‚Äôve been cleared to start taking dextroamphetamine again at 30mg. When I take it I feel much better mentally and I want to keep taking it but since starting again I‚Äôve noticed my POTS is coming back and I‚Äôm getting lightheaded when standing. 

‚Ä¢QUESTIONS: Does anyone have any similar experiences of dextroamphetamine causing POTS? Any advice for how to get myself to eat properly and drink water ? Any similar experiences of trying to manage ADHD while also navigating thyroid issues ? My psychiatrist has told me that the only other ADHD medication I could try is one that works through epinephrine (adrenaline) but I‚Äôm prone to panic attacks and with my PTSD I don‚Äôt think it would be wise to try it- is this true that I‚Äôve exhausted all other options? Has anyone had any similar experiences of liking dextroamphetamine but having to stop for health reasons, and if so, have you found anything else that works instead?

Looking to get a new machine to pair with my DF64v2. I‚Äôm open to a lot of ideas, machine types, and price points.

I do drink a lot of milk drinks, so that is something I am considering as well. I roast my own coffee, and brew a variety of roast levels. I also make coffee for my gf everyday and often have friends over, so the ability to make back to back drinks is important.

As a side note, I want to avoid products that might have hot water running through plastic to decrease my exposure to microplastics, so that rules out a lot of the Chinese machines like HibrewH10B or Turin Legato V2.

I‚Äôm currently exploring:

- odyssey Argos (a bit out of budget but looks great. Not sure how it is for back to back shots)
- Flair 58 + flair wizard steamer (this option is most appealing so far, although heating up the wizard every morning could get annoying)
- Profitec Go
- Gaggia Classic Pro E24

Happy to explore new ideas, but would also appreciate insight into the options I listed.

1k11luk,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1k11luk/karens_and_the_power_process/,Karens and The Power Process,"Let's talk about The Power Process. Ted Kaczynski's outline is intriguing, but it is not a novel idea - Ted does not claim it to be. It dates back to Nietzsche's The Will To Power and beyond.

I will provide Ted's analysis, as it is easily digestible:

*Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call 
the power process. This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but 
is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of 
these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal.*

The final element is **Autonomy** - now let's get into the insanity of the modern consumer and citizen. The average man/woman is alienated from their work. They work at the baby food factory and return home to watch Netflix slop.

Here's where **Karens** arrive. Combine years of worker alienation and generations of propaganda. Your average Karen is powerless. She doesn't realize it, for she has the latest and greatest home and automobile.

**TLDR:** The modern Karen and or consoomer will conjure complaint solely to satisfy their deprived Power Process. They've been denied any sense of real effort and reward. This is why people are increasingly complaining of benign inconveniences. Their coffee isn't hot enough, there aren't enough fries in the bag, etc.

That's the answer to the Karen phenomenon, my friends. If you have any critique, I am all ears.",3,1744855007.0,conspiracy,3,0.8,False

Part [one](https://www.reddit.com/user/OutlawWriter/comments/1jevsbb/journal_of_a_runaway_chapter_1/).

Matt and I were firmly in the grips of near-crippling coke addiction, and he had just gotten fired from a fast food restaurant. That was when he got the idea to rob one of the guys we bought from sometimes. He was a nerdy, quiet white guy with a lisp named Crispin. He lived in a fancy apartment on his mom and dad's money, and sold drugs on the side. We had known him for a while, and he had never shown violent tendencies. We armed ourselves with knives and he made the call. I felt a rush as we snorted the last of our current stash and walked out of our home.

My throat was numb by the time we reached the corner and sweat beaded on my forehead in spite of the chill in the air. We boarded a bus and rode across town to Crispin's building, ringing the buzzer at the front door. He promptly let us inside and we ascended the stairs quickly. The dealer met us at his door, and we stepped into the apartment. Matt wasted no time after I locked the door behind us. He grabbed the dealer by his collar and slammed him into the wall.

‚ÄúWhere's the money and your shit?‚Äù he asked, voice a low, menacing growl.

‚ÄúChill out, man...‚Äù Crispin started to plead.

Matt slapped him. Hard.

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù he demanded.

‚ÄúRelax...‚Äù the nerdy man said, only to be met with another slap, this one splitting his lip.

‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù my roommate demanded again.

‚ÄúIn my room, but dude, please leave it alone.‚Äù the dealer begged.

Matt smirked and this time he punched Crispin hard enough to knock him out. I'll never forget the heavy thud his body made when it hit the ground. I followed my friend down the hall and into the bedroom. We searched the closet and dressers before finding the large, ornate wooden box where he hid the large baggie of white powder and stacks of assorted bills. We left that night on a high much different than the one the chemicals afforded us. We weren't surprised that Crispin never called the cops.

We also weren't shocked that he deactivated his cellphone, and from the rumors we heard a while later, quit the drug game completely. We rationed both the drugs and the money, and we both started panhandling again rather than looking for legitimate employment. We pulled something similar with a few other people when we started running low on cash and drugs, always targeting the weaker people unaffiliated with gangs, and that we knew didn't keep a weapon on them. Things were going pretty well, and I was nearly eighteen when we decided to do it again.

This time, I was the one that made the call, and we were on our way, jittery and high as usual, my eyes scanning the faces of the strangers we passed on the streets, fingers fidgeting with the folding knife in my hip pocket. We rode the bus again, disembarking from the vehicle about a block away from the dealer's apartment. I took the lead as we approached the door, knocking quietly. The dealer, a younger guy named Tony opened up, allowing us inside.

‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù he asked, turning his back to us as I shut and locked the door.

‚ÄúNot much, you have any other company?‚Äù I asked, keeping my demeanor and voice casual.

‚ÄúNot at the moment.‚Äù He replied.

I slipped the knife from my pocket, and flipped the blade open, rushing up past Matt to grab the man around the midsection with one arm, the other placing the sharp edge of the weapon against his neck.

‚ÄúI just want your drugs and your money. Don't make this hard, dude.‚Äù I said into his ear in the lowest tone I could manage. The words felt rehearsed and well-polished as they rolled off of my tongue.

‚ÄúCome on man, don't...‚Äù he started to try to reason with me.

I pressed the tip of the knife to his flesh a little more firmly, but not enough to cut him yet.

Matt had already started searching the living room, and I was getting impatient, the line I had snorted before undertaking the robbery already wearing off.

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù I insisted.

‚ÄúIn a backpack in the hall closet.‚Äù he confessed. I let him go and shoved him toward my roommate.

‚ÄúWatch him for a minute.‚Äù I said.

I turned my back to open the hall closet and by the time I was extracting the bag, Tony had made his move, trying to tackle Matt. They crashed into the coffee table and started throwing punches, wrestling around on the floor after they fell. I dropped the bag to the floor and jumped in, kicking Tony in the side of the head as if trying to score a soccer goal. The man went limp immediately. I helped my roommate to his feet, and turned back to retrieve the drugs and money in the backpack.

‚ÄúUh. I don't think he's breathing.‚Äù I heard Matt's voice as I was confirming the contents of the bag I had been holding before, which did indeed contain all of his drugs and an envelope stuffed with cash. My fear washed away in a wave of euphoria.

I turned and moved to Tony's side, leaning down to check his pulse, but couldn't find one. We both panicked and quickly fled. We avoided the bus, as well, using a lot of alleyways and narrow, quiet residential streets. I couldn't sleep that night, glued to the local news, and sure enough, our friend's body was discovered. I snorted lines until midnight, then took half of the money and drugs from our last score, creeping out into the night. At first, I wasn't really sure where I was going., my feet just carrying me in a random direction.

I stepped into the bathroom of a gas station, and snorted a little bit more coke, then stepped out and bought myself a soda, buying a small map of the area from a spinning rack. I also grabbed a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. I lit one of the cancer sticks while I examined the map I had purchased. I located the nearest rail line and started in that direction, pausing along the way to split the money between my pocket and a pair of clean socks in the single bag I had brought with me. I also snorted another line off of the compact mirror in my hip pocket, then hurried along my way.

I snuck aboard a train, letting myself come down and fall asleep as it started moving. I woke and slipped out of the closed cargo container when it stopped to drop off and pick up a few of the cars, narrowly avoiding a confrontation. I was starting to feel the beginnings of withdrawal as I reached the highway, but wasn't about to pull out my stash and paraphernelia on the side of a busy public road, so I gritted my teeth and stuck my thumb out as I walked. Quite a few cars passed me by before someone stopped for me.

When I reached the next truck stop, I found myself in Idaho. I shut myself in a stall and quickly inhaled some of the white powder, wiping my nose with tissue paper before stepping out to get something to drink. I also bought a few snacks, carrying that bag with me as I walked back toward the exit of the lot. I hitched a ride with a trucker who was headed back into Oregon, and I felt a moment of panic. I hadn't been back to my home state in a few years, and as such had very few contacts there. One positive was that the man didn't mind the fact that I used drugs, because he did too.

I rode with him until we got over the Eastern border of Oregon, parting ways with him in Bend, where I quickly checked into a homeless shelter, where I only slept for a night. The next morning I rode with the others to a day labor service where I was able to get a job repairing a fence that had been damaged in a recent wind storm. I spent that day pounding metal T-posts into the ground, riding a small four-wheeler ahead of the guys stringing the wire. I had enough distance between myself and the other workers to get a little high before they caught up.

At the end of the day, I collected my cash, and used that, along with some of the money I had brought with me to get a room at a decent motel. I also sprung for a good meal that night, then fell asleep watching old movies while stretching out in the overly comfortable bed. I woke up with the fierce urge to urinate, and also to flee. I checked out and spent some time panhandling near the exit of a gas station. When other businesses started opening up, I used the money I had made to supplement what I already had once more.

I bought a gym bag and another pair of jeans, a few pairs of underwear, socks, and shoes as well as a package of plain-colored shirts. I also invested in a decent coat, planning on pushing North and back East into Montana rather than lingering in Oregon. How I was going to get there became the question, and I stayed in Redmond, spending a little more on a room and a road atlas. I spent most of that night trying not to use the last of my drugs and studying the book of maps while leaving the television on for background noise.

By the time I laid my head down, I had a decent plan to get out of the state. The next morning I checked out early again and started down the rural highway toward Portland. I spent most of that morning walking, very little traffic passing me in either direction. Those that did pass me by, continued down the road. I was happy to see a service station in the distance. I walked in, thirsty and tired. I was disappointed to see the place as empty as the small lot out front. The old man behind the counter looked at me for a long time.

‚ÄúYou traveling far?‚Äù he asked.

I shrugged.

‚ÄúI'm looking at heading to Montana for a while, see what's up that way.‚Äù I replied, trying to sound casual though I was already feeling twitchy and irritable.

I dropped my bag near the door to the bathroom as I walked in there to use the urinal and snort a line of my dwindling supply of coke from the pocket mirror. I felt better when I emerged from the small room, reclaiming my bags, before looking at the cooler where the drinks were stored, carrying a couple of bottles of water to the counter. When I paid the man slid me a burrito from the hot case.

‚ÄúI'm sure you need what money you have to get to where you're going, so that's on the house.‚Äù he told me with a smile.

I said 'thank you' and walked outside, sitting on the corner of the small curb to eat what I had been given, hoping that a car would pull in. No one did, however, so I started walking again. I got a ride a little less than an hour later, the man giving me a lift as far as a small town called Antelope. I paid for a room again, though I was getting lower on funds than I would have liked. I also began to hope I could find some drugs soon as my supply continued to dwindle. The next morning I spent the money to get a bus ticket that afternoon that would take me to Kennewick Washington.

Once I had my travel secured, I panhandled outside of a large church, surprised at the generosity of the people in the small town. I slept on the long ride, waking when we stopped for food and to use the restroom. I lit a cigarette after doing just that, moving to stand beside the bus, swallowing the water I had bought in large gulps. A few other smokers approached me.

‚ÄúYou got a lighter?‚Äù one of the women asked.

I nodded and silently handed mine over.

‚ÄúThanks. So, where you headed?‚Äù she prodded at me, handing the lighter back.

‚ÄúKennewick, you?‚Äù I turned the query around on her.

‚ÄúSame. My mom's sick.‚Äù she told me.

""Sorry to hear that.‚Äù I said, then stubbed my cigarette out and moved to climb back onto the bus.

I tried to go back to sleep, and succeeded for a while, though I woke when we stopped to let people off and on a few times. By the time we arrived at our destination, I felt like death. The wait to claim my bag felt like roasting in the fires of Hell. I practically jogged to the room that housed the toilets, locking myself in a stall. I snorted the last of my drugs and then started out onto the street, lighting another cigarette as I walked toward the downtown area. I stopped at a small corner store, grabbing a bottle of water and a few other things.

‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù the bored, twenty-something girl working the register offered.

‚ÄúActually, yeah. Is there a shelter in this town?‚Äù I asked, digging the cash to pay for my stuff from my pocket.

‚ÄúNo, but try the Catholic church. I know they let people sleep there sometimes. It's down two blocks and around the corner to the right a little ways.‚Äù I nodded and collected my bag of food and water, then started out again.

I found the church exactly where the girl had said it would be, and was welcomed inside by a kindly lady who worked in the office when I rang the bell next to the doors which I found to be locked. I was allowed to sleep in the chapel with a few other transients. I kept to myself as did the few other strangers in the building that night. The next morning, I wasted no time finding my way to a small homeless encampment. It took me a while, but I managed to find a hook up and score some more drugs, replenishing my stash.

I got high enough that the world became a blur and hopped another train, tucking myself into one of the enclosed cars, behind crates of boxes. As the locomotive began to roll, I snorted some more of the white powder, trying to quell my uncertainty. I didn't know that this would be the trip that changed me.",1,1744854539.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

1. Things we like:
- Customer service is very good
- Landscaping is nice. We felt very relaxed. 
- Pool has a good size for kids to play
- Breakfast included 
- Close to all nice beaches and good food spots

2. Things we don't like:
- No oven, no kettle, few basic old cookwares. 
- Broken coffee machine
- Dirty toaster
- They only gave us 1 dish detergent pack for whole stay. No extra trash bags under the sink
They don't offer as many toiletries like other hotels. Like no Qtips, no hair showering cap, ect. We lost our comb and they don't have any cheap one for guests. Toothbrushes are not free.
- Laundry detergent is expensive and small. I highly recommend you buy a small bottle from stores if you need to do more than 2-3 loads
- Crib matress is so thin so my little couldn't sleep on it. The surface was so hard. We tried to put bed comforter but it didn't help much. 
- Body wash bottle was empty when we arrived
- If you don't have cash, you need to use their ATM to withdraw cash to exchange coins for laundry machines.It's 5$ fee per transaction. Other hotels would apply charge on oour room and give us coins. 

We understand that Maui is expensive but with the room rate is 500-700$ per night, we expect that they should do better. Sorry if there were any grammar errors in my post, English is not my first language. Hope my review can help you to choose a good place for your trip.

Still want something that will wake me up/help me do work. Not a fan of coffee but had French vanillas before (with ~100 mg caffeine) and no issues. Dont wanna give up on energy drinks just yet. So any idea what gave me the cramp?

Should add I had it with a decent sized meal and am otherwise fairly healthy  ",1,1744854090.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False

# Step 1: The ""3 Bucket"" Hack to Avoid Boredom

üß†¬†*Neuroscience shows*¬†we need¬†**novelty, growth, and connection**¬†to thrive. Try:

* **Bucket 1: Learn**¬†(Take a pottery class¬†*badly*‚Äîprogress beats perfection!)
* **Bucket 2: Earn**¬†(Monetize a passion project, e.g., selling vintage finds on Etsy)
* **Bucket 3: Return**¬†(Mentor others‚Äîlinked to¬†**27% lower depression rates**¬†in retirees)

# Step 2: Rewire Your Identity (Without the Job Title)

üíº¬†*Career withdrawal is real.*¬†Instead of ""I¬†*was*¬†a teacher,"" try:

* **""I**¬†***am***¬†**a...""**¬†(gardener, storyteller, community historian)
* **Pro Tip:**¬†Join a club with¬†*rituals*¬†(like a weekly hiking group)‚Äîstructure = stability.

‚è≥¬†*Divide your day like the world‚Äôs happiest retirees*¬†(Harvard study):

* 2 hrs¬†**creating**¬†(painting, writing)
* 1 hr¬†**moving**¬†(pickleball, yoga)
* 1 hr¬†**connecting**¬†(coffee with friends)
* 1 hr¬†**contributing**¬†(volunteering)

# Step 4: Try a ""Mini-Retirement"" (Before You Fully Retire!)

üå±¬†*Test-drive hobbies now*¬†to avoid the¬†*""Now what?!""*¬†panic:

I don't drink coffee on the day I take it. When I did it felt fine for 2 weeks, but started to get bad acid reflux, weird body feeling. Initially, getting off caffeine is met by headache. The withdrawal symptoms have greatly diminished since I started doing so. 

In term of efficiency, I am literally getting 12+ hr everytime. The second day is always better. I have found that Vyvanse wears me off, I am not used to work so much. It carries me the rest of the days I do not take it. My main issue being starting to do stuff and staying on track when switching task. 

I'm not recommending others to do that, but it definitely help keeping the dosage lower. In my situation I am able to manage whatever ADHD symptoms I may have with my work. Prior to Vyvanse, I was not feeling like I had any work accomplishments or recognition. 

I am not sure how common it is, but my practitioner recommended to not take it continuously if that formula works for me. Prior to doing that I was taking it continuously and wanted to go to 30 mg. 

In term of side effects, sleep comes first. I need to drink a lot of water or I get headache and other side effects, usually body discomfort. I think drinking water also help with not staying too focused all day long. 

I was diagnosed as a kid and put on ritalin. Tried concerta as a bachelor student. If I had Vyvanse I would have certainly done better. I didn't like concerta effects. Vyvanse is just focus and fluidity. It might also be related to my routine. If I stay inside all day remote working I would probably not feel as productive because of the distractions.

1k116yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1k116yz/the_tariff_game/,"""The Tariff Game""","# Chapter 1: The 145% Lifeline

Jack Howard stared at the email on his screen, his fingers drumming unconsciously on the desk. The message from their Chinese supplier was brutally concise: ""Due to new U.S. tariff policies, all component prices increased by 145%, effective immediately.""

""This is fucking robbery!"" Jack slammed his coffee cup down, dark liquid splashing across the quarterly financial report already bleeding red numbers.

Outside his glass office walls, employees pretended to focus on their work, but Jack knew they were stealing glances. As founder and CEO of BrightHome Smart Living, he understood better than anyone what this number meant: 72% of components in their best-selling smart thermostat came from China. A 145% tariff hike would double their production costs overnight.

""Jack, the White House just held a press conference."" COO Sarah Chen entered holding a tablet showing Trump's signature gold-and-red tie. ""National security tariffs on all Chinese electronics take effect next week‚Äîincluding our core chips and sensors.""

Jack grabbed the remote to turn up the TV volume. On screen, Trump raised a finger at the cameras: ""We gave China plenty of opportunities... Now it's time to put American workers back on assembly lines!"" The camera cut to Commerce Secretary Ross and trade advisor Navarro applauding like marionettes.

""Assholes!"" Jack muted the TV. ""Do they know how many of these 'Chinese parts' contain American patented technology? Or that our California factory employs five hundred...""

His vibrating phone interrupted the rant. The caller ID read ""Davis Craig""‚Äîtheir lead venture capitalist. Jack took a deep breath before answering. The cold Wall Street voice stated: ""Jack, the board unanimously believes BrightHome is unsustainable under current trade conditions. Unless you present a viable domestic supply chain solution within thirty days, we'll initiate liquidation procedures.""

Hanging up, Jack gazed at San Francisco's skyline. Three years ago, Wired magazine named his smart home system one of ""10 Life-Changing Inventions."" Last year, company valuation surpassed $1 billion. Now, the Trump administration's tariff hammer was smashing his American dream to pieces.

""Wait..."" Sarah suddenly grabbed her tablet. ""New customs guidelines show semi-finished modules might qualify for different rates. If we disassemble the Chinese sensor modules into‚Äî""

Jack cut her off: ""Won't work. Ross already promised to close all loopholes within a month."" He pointed at the TV replay showing the Commerce Secretary threatening to tariff entire semiconductor supply chains.

The office fell silent. Jack swiveled his chair toward the strategy whiteboard covered with supplier maps and cost analyses. Suddenly, his eyes caught an old photo in the corner‚Äîhis father posing at a Detroit auto plant. That once-thriving manufacturing hub now lay littered with abandoned factories...

""Sarah,"" Jack stood abruptly, ""book two tickets to Michigan. I know where we might find our lifeline.""

""Detroit? What's left there besides bankruptcy filings and rusted assembly lines?""

""The last generation of true American craftsmen,"" Jack grabbed his jacket, ""and exactly what Trump wants to tweet about‚Äîa 'tariff-proof' success story.""

(Next chapters would explore how Jack rebuilds supply chains in industrial ruins, exploits policy loopholes, and creates a hybrid manufacturing model that satisfies both ""Made in America"" political demands and competitive business realities‚Äîcarving a path through the trade war minefield.)

We adopted a 1 year old cat about 2 months ago. He is a sweetheart and overall adjusted pretty fast being with us. He loves his toys and seems very well socialized given interactions with friends we have had over and cat sitters. 

One escalating issue has been his obsession with food - he will lick anything, even a skillet that hasn‚Äôt been used but is on the counter just to see if there is food on it. It‚Äôs very hard to keep him off the counters and out of the sink to look for stuff. We have really buckled down on keeping counter spotless and sink empty but he will not leave us alone if we are in the kitchen at all. Overall, we have tried hiding kibble around the house for him to find, positive reinforcement of staying on cat tree when we are eating (he definitely has learned the word place is associated with the cat tree and he will get a treat and does at least seem to hang out there more than before). In the last week, he has had some escalating behavior - ripping bag of potatoes, last night he even ripped open a bag of coffee beans and they spilled everywhere.

We have the Pet Libro auto feeder - he gets 3 servings at 6 am, 1 at 6pm + 3 oz wet food, and 1 serving at 12 am. He didn‚Äôt used to howl in the middle of the night but now he does. 

Recent vet check up with no concerns. He was dewormed right before we got him. 

All of this to say, we are wondering if anyone had success with switching kibble formulas? The one we have is 30% crude protein but I see some with higher amounts (39-42%). Did anyone try this as an option for a cat freaking out over food and did the change help?

**Part Six**

The sky is finally clear and the sun is just starting to rise. I‚Äôm careful not to make a sound as I creep through my mother‚Äôs apartment, and I turn the knob to the patio door nice and slow but the damn thing makes a loud click anyway. I let myself outside and close the door behind me.

I can‚Äôt sleep.¬†

So many things keep coming up from the past and this patio is one of them. I‚Äôve been over to the railing twice since I was five. Once was yesterday when my mother forced me and once was twelve years ago. The bad day. The day I lost my father. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm up here. Sometimes you hear a voice in your head that won‚Äôt leave you alone;¬† a voice that you know doesn't belong to you, but you can‚Äôt say that to anyone else because it sounds crazy. Sometimes crazy is true.¬†

I try to ignore it most of the time but sometimes it gets too loud, so loud I don‚Äôt feel like me.

Sometimes if I don‚Äôt want to listen to that voice that has infected and drowned out every other thought I have, I end up hurting myself to make it go away. I‚Äôve done it three times. The pain clears my head. A kind of reset. That‚Äôs what I always thought anyway.

I listened to the voice all night and I‚Äôm still listening to it this morning. I don‚Äôt want to make it go away this time. It‚Äôs taking my attention away from the thought of what I did at City Hall yesterday, and what I‚Äôm probably going to have to do again today, and possibly everyday for the rest of my life. For the first time that nagging voice is a welcome distraction and I follow its call to the handrail at the edge of the patio.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live like this anymore.‚Äù*

It‚Äôs his voice. My hands shake as they grip the metal rail and I close my eyes as I drop my head down.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm living a lie.‚Äù*

I focus on my breath. I try to keep it slow and steady as the voice becomes clearer.

*‚ÄúSomething has to be done, Aaron.‚Äù*¬†

I steady my legs before I open my eyes again. The whole memory is a flash. One instant where everything happens at once.

*‚ÄúI never wanted any of this. This is all the fault of your mother. Forgive me.‚Äù*

I expect to hear a scream like when he fell, but all I hear is the wind. I expect to see my father down there when I open my eyes, but he‚Äôs not. Just a peaceful street, way way down.¬†

‚ÄúAaron?‚Äù My heart jumps even though my mother‚Äôs voice is soft.¬† I didn‚Äôt hear the knob click. How does she do it? She‚Äôs always able to creep up on me.

‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear you come in.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry mom, and I‚Äôm sorry I left early last night.‚Äù I turn to her and the expression on her face turns to worry as soon as she sees mine.

‚ÄúYou look terrible. Are you feeling alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I just didn‚Äôt get much sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù Should I tell her? I‚Äôve never told her what my father said. How he blamed her for what he did. No, I can‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI was just thinking about what you said yesterday. I just wanted to look at the city from up here and remember what it is that we do at City Hall‚Ä¶ and what we do it for. I needed to look over all of it. It‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù I‚Äôm not in the habit of lying to my mother and I‚Äôm surprised at how easy it came without much thought. She smiles at me. She believes what I just said. She has no clue that I was thinking of my father. Remembering how it felt to see his body and everything that was in it, spread out all over the street way way down.

In her mind, it's all in the past. She never let me talk about it. I learned by the time I was eight that I would have to carry most of it on my own. Tommy helps, but he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it either. At least I understand why he doesn‚Äôt. He was there.

\-

I‚Äôm still the only person standing on the tram, but no one is looking at me this morning. They‚Äôre all talking amongst each other about something that happened yesterday and maybe if I wasn‚Äôt so exhausted, I‚Äôd listen to the conversations, but that voice in my head is louder than the technicians and it's joined by others I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time. I close my eyes and listen to all the internal chatter. I feel myself dozing off, but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôll take any sleep I can get right now.

My body moves and sways with the movements of the tram. Like waves.

Back and forth.¬†

Back and forth.

\-

I open my eyes and I‚Äôm running down the beach. After almost a month of keeping me inside the apartment, my parents finally let me go back to the beach. My mom brings me. My dad was already drinking that stuff that smells bad and he couldn‚Äôt walk straight so my mom told him to stay home.

I see all the kids playing down by the water. I see Heather digging a hole in the sand. She‚Äôs all by herself. I‚Äôm so happy to see my friend. I yell her name over and over as I run down to her, but she doesn‚Äôt look up.

‚ÄúHi Heather!‚Äù She still doesn‚Äôt say anything. She turns her back to me and continues to dig. I move in front of her .‚ÄúHi! Do you want to play with me?‚Äù She has her head down. She still doesn‚Äôt answer. She turns her back to me again. I wonder if the waves are loud and that‚Äôs why she can‚Äôt hear me. I look at the other kids playing. Some of them are looking at me. Some of them are pointing at me. I wave at them but they don‚Äôt wave back.

‚ÄúMy mom and dad wouldn‚Äôt let me leave the apartment. They said I had to stay inside for a while.‚Äù She pulls out a huge armful of sand and throws it on my feet, but she still doesn‚Äôt look at me.

‚ÄúCan I help you dig?‚Äù She shakes her head. Why won‚Äôt she look at me? She‚Äôs my only friend. I stand there for a little bit longer not knowing what to say. I feel stupid.

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs sposed to talk to you anymore.‚Äù She whispers. She doesn‚Äôt look at me.

Did I do something bad? After a moment, I squat down close to her and start drawing in the sand with my finger. She really likes frogs, so I draw the best one I can for her and then I tap her shoulder.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ look what I drew.‚Äù She brushes away my hand. She looks at me. She‚Äôs crying. She has a big white bandage on her throat. Little grains of yellow sand are stuck to it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Did you get hurt?‚Äù I think that maybe Devon said something mean to her. I look around but I don‚Äôt see her older brother. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Devon?‚Äù¬†

She gets up and runs away from me. She runs back to her parents and her mom picks her up. Heather is crying really bad now. Her dad is looking at me. He looks mad. I watch them fold up their chairs and walk away. I can see Heather looking at me over her mother‚Äôs shoulder and she looks really mad. I don‚Äôt see her brother anywhere. Her brother is always here when they come to the beach. I wonder if he‚Äôs sick.

A lot of the other parents are looking at me and talking to each other. I turn around and most of the other kids had been looking at me, but they all quickly look away. I feel so alone.

I sit down on the sand and grab handfuls of it and watch the grains fall out from between my fingers.

\-

The tram stops and my legs give out from under me. I spill onto the floor and the other technicians are all amused at the mishap. Most of them are laughing.

I don‚Äôt care.

I‚Äôm so tired.

\-

I‚Äôm trying to keep my eyes open. Norman had told me that Simon and I had made a good team, so he moved the technician who worked next to Simon and also removed the partition between the two stations so Simon could keep training me. I‚Äôve been fooling around with the system all morning. Learning all the codes and ins and outs of¬† facilitating ‚Äúreductions‚Äù, while Simon busies himself with his data collection on non productive elderly chattel. I‚Äôve had a few questions and rather than say a single word to me, Simon has just leaned over and showed me. I guess he‚Äôs pissed about losing a record that I wish I had never broken.

After doing a little poking around, I figure out how to manipulate the monitoring station feeds. Moving and focusing the cameras. Isolating audio and amplifying it. I learn how to track biomarkers, small tracking devices that every person behind the wall is implanted with when they‚Äôre born. I watch the streets behind the wall and the people that walk along the sidewalks act more like ants than people. Heads down. No one talks. Home to station and station to home. Simon has me watching a manufacturing district in the north east corner of the city. He says there‚Äôs low station neighborhoods and then there‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm watching, ‚ÄúThe biggest shithole in the entire shithole.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sunny day but everything I‚Äôve seen inside the wall is dimly lit, like the sun doesn‚Äôt even shine on these people.

I come across one old woman standing on a street corner and she‚Äôs just staring up at the monitoring station, straight into the camera. There are tears in her eyes. Eventually she slowly shakes her head and walks away.

I also figured out how to retrieve archived footage. I have the file of Shawn‚Äôs death on my screen. The man who is still hovering over the street in my head, waiting for me to allow him to complete his journey in this life and rest in peace, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to watch the footage. I keep the tile on the upper right hand corner of the screen telling myself that I need to open it before I leave today. I don‚Äôt want to have another night like I did last night.

I watch Simon pull a small pill out of a tiny metal box and put it under his tongue. He looks over and pushes the metal box toward me.

‚ÄúYou want one?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll keep you sharp and ready to go. A technician‚Äôs best friend.‚Äù He shakes the box and the little pills jump inside of it.

‚ÄúNo thank you. I‚Äôm good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? You look like shit.‚Äù I shake my head. ‚ÄúOk. Suit yourself. It‚Äôs almost time for lunch break. You gotta do one. Let‚Äôs get on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúSecond day. You have to do one before lunch and one before you go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Norman didn‚Äôt say anything to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah he did. He told you that I was training you and I say we have to get one done before lunch. That‚Äôs in ten minutes. This time you have to try and do it without threatening them though. They‚Äôve got to agree to do it without being threatened. Sometimes that can work but most of the time if you threaten them because it‚Äôs not going your way, the next thing you know, they go fuckin‚Äô crazy and start killing other Simps, or light their buildings on fire‚Ä¶ all kinds of crazy shit. They‚Äôre not the smartest things in the world and they‚Äôre almost to the breaking point anyway. You gotta try and make them feel comfortable and ready to go. That‚Äôs the whole point of our station. Isolate the defective Simp and don‚Äôt cause any collateral damage while you're doing it.‚Äù

I try to come up with something to say. I‚Äôm too tired. I‚Äôm not ready. I‚Äôm not going to be able to do it. All of these jam and mash together in my head and it causes my mouth to fumble over all the words at once. I‚Äôm finally able to say something, but he points to my screen. I‚Äôm online with someone.

My microphone is live and I hear it click over. Someone is on the other end and I can hear him breathing.¬† Just do it, Aaron. Get it over with. This is part of keeping things going whether you like it or not.

‚ÄúHello Daniel. I apologize for being absent for a moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand, Consensus.‚Äù¬†

His information on the screen says he labors in the manufacturing district that I‚Äôve been watching on the cameras. He‚Äôs thirty seven years old. No family. Admitted to the hospital last week after a failed attempt to hang himself. That was logged as the first instance of Suicidal Ideation/ Ad Or Attempt after one session with Consensus in the hospital. The second was the mere question of an afterlife to the Consensus system just last night. He‚Äôs logged in now from a terminal at his station in the middle of his shift. It gives a list of possible suggestions to recommend ways to end his life based on his current location.

Brake Press

Bandsaw

Welder

I don‚Äôt read the rest. My stomach turns. If I had bothered to eat anything since yesterday, it would be all over the monitor in front of me.

‚ÄúPlease go on, Daniel. What‚Äôs troubling you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the point in all of this, Consensus? I‚Äôve been a good man. A man of Consensus. Why do I feel like nothing has any meaning? Why do I feel this way?‚Äù Simon is listening in on the call and points to a word on the screen and smiles.¬† He mouths the words, ‚ÄúDo this one‚Äù. The voice in my headset is desperate and the man training me is practically jumping in his seat waiting for me to convince someone to end their own life with a bandsaw.¬† I stutter and then I disconnect the call.¬†

I can‚Äôt do this.¬†

I won‚Äôt do this.

‚ÄúWhat did you do that for?‚Äù Simon sounds like a disappointed child. His face is getting red as he scratches at the patchy hair on his neck.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not ready yet, Simon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell why didn‚Äôt you signal for me to take over? It‚Äôs done now. Norman is going to ask me why your call had to be referred to a Bishop.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was it, kid. Three sessions. That‚Äôs all they get. Once you‚Äôre done with the session, you log him in for Reduction and if he doesn‚Äôt do it himself within twenty four hours, if his biomarker doesn‚Äôt go cold, then a Bishop is called. But you just bypassed that whole thing. He‚Äôs dying today and you just dropped the ball.‚Äù He starts laughing and Norman walks over. He‚Äôs got a large coffee stain on his white shirt that he keeps trying to cover with his tie.¬†

‚ÄúWhat happened? I just got the notification.‚Äù

‚ÄúAaron accidentally disconnected the session.‚Äù Simon says it before I can get a word past my lips. He‚Äôs trying not to laugh at me.

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù Norman sighs. He throws his hands up in the air. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it happens. Usually not quite in this way, but ok. Better it happen in your first week than later. That would be really embarrassing. Don‚Äôt feel bad about it, Aaron.‚Äù

Simon turns back to his terminal and sticks his keyboard with his thick fingers. He claps as he reads something on the screen.

‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs been referred to Castor! Second time this week!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! That‚Äôll be a good one! Have you seen an Example yet, Aaron?‚Äù Norman asks me with a giddy lilt, implying that I‚Äôm going to see something truly special today if I haven‚Äôt already.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, this will be a good one. Castor is‚Ä¶ unique to say the least.‚Äù He turns and raises his high voice. ‚ÄúAlright everyone, let's take a break, stretch our legs. The Painted Bishop is about to make another Example today!‚Äù

Most of the technicians in the room clap their hands. Some of them cheer.

\-

Lunch is the same as it was yesterday. Simon eats and doesn‚Äôt talk much. I can‚Äôt eat. I tried. It‚Äôs been almost twenty four hours since I‚Äôve eaten anything.

I look around the cafeteria. All the faces I see are animated and engaged with all the other faces around them. I can hear a few of them sharing Simon‚Äôs excitement about a Bishop named Castor and the Example he‚Äôs about to make. There‚Äôs at least two hundred people in here and I feel completely alone.

I start to doze off again, and I feel someone tapping my shoulder.

‚ÄúHey. Come on. Drink this.‚Äù

Simon has put a large mug of coffee in front of me on the table.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really drink coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúKid, you look halfdead and you‚Äôre making me look bad. Just drink it. Trust me. Now come on, we have to get back to work.‚Äù

\-

I‚Äôm on my second cup of coffee and I feel slightly better, but my heart is racing and the sweat from under my arms is starting to soak through my shirt. I had to loosen my tie. Simon has been doing what he‚Äôs best at for the last three hours. How can he honestly enjoy this?¬†

‚ÄúKelly, unfortunately I‚Äôve done everything I can for you. It‚Äôs my assessment that you should¬† make way for someone more grateful and genuinely happy to live in this perfect society that I have built for all of you.‚Äù His voice is calm and measured. He turns to me while he‚Äôs talking to her and makes a motion as if he‚Äôs stabbing himself in the stomach.¬†

‚ÄúPlease, Consensus. I was just asking questions.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kelly. All my calculations point to the logical conclusion that you will never be happy. You will never feel as if you have a purpose. You will never know any kind of peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm asking you for help. I know that Consensus is survival‚Ä¶‚Äù A small tile pops up on the bottom of his screen while she‚Äôs talking. He looks at it and pumps his fists in the air and everything changes.

‚ÄúLook bitch, you‚Äôre ungrateful. I‚Äôve rendered my verdict. Kill yourself or I‚Äôll send The Clerks to Purify you in front of your family. Understand?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...ok‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye!‚Äù He ends the session the way he showed me, marking the person‚Ä¶ chattel, down as having her third session. He looks at me. ‚ÄúOk, I know I said not to threaten them, but we‚Äôve got Castor on video, and I‚Äôm not going to waste any more time with that Simp. Fuck her. Who knows, she might chicken out and you‚Äôll get to see her Purified.‚Äù He pulls up the small tile, clicks on it, and starts dancing in his chair. ‚ÄúOh, this ones going to be good.‚Äù

The video on his screen begins. The street is busy and the sidewalk is even busier. Simon points to one of the men on the sidewalk.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your guy! Right there! Walking back to his empty home. Probably thinking that tonight, he‚Äôs going to end it all on his own. In a couple of seconds, he‚Äôs going to wish that he had done himself in.‚Äù We watch him walk in the crowd. It‚Äôs difficult to keep an eye on him in the middle of all of the people. The sun is going down and the street lights are on. I can only see the top of his head. It looks like he tripped because he was there and then the next moment, he was gone. I hear yelling and screaming and suddenly the entire crowd pulls back against the buildings. They form a large circle, and in the middle of it are two men.¬†

The man I had talked to earlier is facedown on the ground screaming. A tall thin man stands over him in a hooded trench coat. The thin man is holding a silver hammer like the Bishops in front of the doors at City Hall, but one side of the hammer looks like it has been filed down and it comes to a point like an axe. The thin man pulls a long rope out of his trenchcoat and goes to the man on the ground.

Everyone on the street has backed away from what‚Äôs going on, but they‚Äôre all watching. None of them do anything to help the pleading man on the street while his hands are tied together at the wrists.

‚ÄúNobody ever comes forward to help.‚Äù Simon is speaking in monotone. His eyes are fixed in awe and admiration and his fingers gingerly pet his lips. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ except for the other night I guess. No one is ever gonna step forward after that.‚Äù

I want to ask him what he means, but I can't take my eyes off the screen.

The man throws off the trench coat and he‚Äôs wearing what‚Äôs left of a white robe of a Bishop. His head is shaved and his robe has no sleeves and it's in tatters. I can see the sinewy build of him through the shredded bits of linen. The robe is stained with mud and blood. He looks so filthy that I swear I can smell him through the screen.¬† His face and arms are covered in scars and tattoos.¬†

The Bishop drags the man towards the pole of the nearest monitoring station. He throws one end of the rope up and over the top of it and then hoists the man up by his wrists. The man is hanging about five feet from the pavement when the Bishop ties the other end of the rope to the bottom of the pole.

‚ÄúHe usually breaks their backs like he did here, but sometimes he just breaks their legs so when he hoists them up, they struggle a lot more.‚Äù Simon sounds disappointed that the screaming man hanging by his wrists isn‚Äôt struggling enough.¬†

The Bishop steps back and lets the robe drop from his shoulders down to his belt. Almost his entire torso is covered in tattoos. Tattoos of eyes.

‚ÄúHere he goes. Listen to his voice. Gets me every time.‚Äù Simon turns up the volume to my headset.¬†

The Bishop raises his hammer and stretches his arms wide.

‚ÄúThis man has willingly defied the laws of Consensus.‚Äù His speech is slow and methodical, a deep terrible thing with an off kilter cadence that puts me on edge. ‚ÄúIf there is one person who finds fault in the ruling of Consensus, let them come forward.‚Äù He closes his eyes and he pauses.

No one comes forward.

‚ÄúThen let his punishment be carried out. Let him be an Example!‚Äù

He spins the hammer in his hand and walks over to the hanging man. The Bishop grabs one of his feet and chops at the man‚Äôs ankle with the sharpened end. I can barely watch as he hacks at the man‚Äôs ankle over and over until the foot comes off, and I refuse to watch anymore when he does the same to the other ankle, but I hear the whole thing.

When the Bishop is finished and both of the man‚Äôs severed feet are on the ground, he once again raises his hands in the air.

‚ÄúWe abide in Consensus!‚Äù¬†

The crowd of people answer him back. Their tone is flat and emotionless. A rehearsed response that they‚Äôve obviously given time and time again.

‚ÄúAnd Consensus abides in us.‚Äù

Once the Example is finished, Castor picks up his long trench coat and walks into an alleyway. The people on the street all continue walking on at the same monotonous pace that they were before. None of them look at the screaming man hanging from a rope while he slowly bleeds out of his ankles. I turn to Simon and he‚Äôs already looking at me with the widest smile.

‚ÄúWhat do you think of that shit?!‚Äù

\-

Simon has been wrapped up in his Reductions and when he hasn‚Äôt been doing that, he‚Äôs been watching the Example over and over again. Studying it.

I‚Äôve been back to my tinkering in the system, hoping that he‚Äôll forget that I‚Äôm supposed to log in one more reduction before the end of our shift. With ten minutes left he turns to me.

‚ÄúShit. I forgot. I‚Äôve got to have you do one more.‚Äù I already planned for him to remember. I already knew exactly how I was going to get out of this.

‚ÄúWait. There was something I wanted to ask you about Castor.‚Äù His eyes light up.

‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the story? Why does he look like that?‚Äù He licks his lips at the question. I‚Äôve got him on a subject that he could obviously talk about for hours.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of us. Well‚Ä¶ was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a Simp. He used to work in Reductions. Can you imagine that?! A fuckin‚Äô animal like that working on a keyboard and eating pound cake while he talks into a headset! I missed him by a few years, but Norman worked with him. He couldn‚Äôt handle it out here. He swore he would be of better use to society if he could go inside and become a Bishop.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Founders let him do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if he agreed to let them put a biomarker in him. He didn‚Äôt care. I think he just worked in here too long, watching the Bishops and the Clerks do their work in there and he just decided he wanted to actually‚Ä¶‚Äù He closes his fingers slowly and makes two fists and his eyes shoot upward. Simon is imagining what he‚Äôs describing, and he‚Äôs getting off on it. ‚Äú... to actually do the work yourself, instead of just pushing someone to do it. To feel what it‚Äôs like. Here‚Ä¶look at this.‚Äù

He looks around to check if anyone is looking and then he unbuttons his sleeve and pulls it up. Just above his wrist, he has a tattoo of two eyes.

‚ÄúCastor marks himself every time he makes an Example. He remembers their eyes and then he draws them on himself. These right here‚Ä¶ a few years ago, I did exactly what you did today, but I did it on purpose. I had a Reduction come my way from the manufacturing district and I purposely disconnected in the hopes that Castor would be the Bishop that was referred to her. He was. After he left her hanging there, I zoomed in from one of the cameras across the street and I grabbed a frame of her eyes. Sounds stupid, but I feel like I was right there with him. I waited for the next time he did an Example and I froze every frame, trying to figure out where he marked himself with her eyes, and I finally saw it.¬†

I had it done in the same place. Sounds a little childish and maybe a little stupid, but I kind of feel like we did one together. Like we were partners. Does that sound stupid?‚Äù

He‚Äôs looking for validation. I can‚Äôt say what I want to say. I can‚Äôt grab him by his greasy hair and put his head through the monitor which still shows the image of his hero and his work. I say what I‚Äôm supposed to say.

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs not stupid. I get it.‚Äù His face lights up and he pulls his sleeve back down.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never shown anybody that. Everybody has a favorite Bishop. Anthony and Pike are fun to watch. Most people like the Red Bishop, but mine has always been Castor. I feel like we‚Äôre kind of the same on some levels. Well, we‚Äôre running out of time, so we‚Äôll just get you on one first thing in the morning. I‚Äôll just tell Norman that we had too much to go over to fit in another one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Thanks, Simon.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt get on the tram with the rest of the technicians from Department 49. Instead, I walk down the steps of City Hall and walk along the side of the building. The moon is out tonight and it‚Äôs so cold, but I have to see something. I find the tracks for the supply train and I follow them away from City Hall. The tracks that ultimately lead through the wall and into that dark hopeless city.

The wind is still and I can‚Äôt hear anything but my own footsteps on the gravel between the tracks. I walk a little more than a mile and I leave the tracks and walk to the top of a steep hill. Even in the moonlight the towering black wall shines and stretches as far as I can see from the south to the north. I needed to look at it. I needed to see it with my own eyes, not as some image on a screen, but something real. Something I could touch if I wanted to. Something I could just as easily have been trapped behind if I had been born to a different woman.

My heart is still racing and despite the cold, I‚Äôm pouring sweat. I scream at the wall in the dark until I can‚Äôt scream anymore.

\-

I board another tram as soon as it pulls up and several other technicians from other departments get on after me. It‚Äôs hot in the tram and after I sit down, I put my forehead on the window and enjoy the feeling of cold. Everyone avoids sitting next to me and the seats fill up, and when the last woman gets on, I can see out of the corner of my eye that she hesitates before she sits down next to the disheveled and deranged looking teenager pressing his sweaty head against the window.

We begin our descent back down the hill to the city, and I put my back against the seat and watch the window fog up from the unbearable heat inside the tram. I glance at the woman next to me.

A face I haven‚Äôt seen in a very long time. She has a large scar on her throat. She knows I‚Äôm looking at her but she keeps her eyes forward. I realize I‚Äôm staring and I shake my head and stare forward as well. The tram takes forever to get to the city and the two of us sit in awkward silence while the other technicians talk about their day.

It‚Äôs the perfect terrible end to a terrible day. I feel like I should say something, but I‚Äôve got nothing. Finally, just before we come to a stop, I take my finger and draw a simple frog on the fogged up window. She doesn‚Äôt say anything, but I see her look at it before she gets off the tram.

# Who‚Äôs Behind Time Codes?

Meet **Wyatt Woodsmall**, the brains behind *Time Codes*.

Wyatt‚Äôs been teaching people how to unlock their full potential for decades, and this course is one of his standout works. With *Time Codes - Wyatt Woodsmall*, he‚Äôs giving us the keys to something we all want more of‚Äî**time** (or at least how to use it better).

# What Exactly Are ‚ÄúTime Codes‚Äù?

Great question. This isn‚Äôt just another time management course filled with to-do lists and productivity apps. Nah, this course goes deeper. *Time Codes - Wyatt Woodsmall* introduces a **whole system of mental patterns**‚Äîthink of them as internal ‚Äúcodes‚Äù we subconsciously follow when dealing with time. Some help us stay focused, others? Not so much. Wyatt teaches you how to spot these internal time traps and flip the script so you‚Äôre running the show, not your procrastination habits.

# When Should You Dive Into This Course?

There‚Äôs no better time than *right now*. Feeling overwhelmed? Constantly racing the clock? Procrastinating like it‚Äôs an Olympic sport? Then this course is your new best friend.

# Where Does It Happen?

The course is in digital format (PDF), so it‚Äôs a breeze to access.

There‚Äôs no rigid structure or live calls, so you‚Äôre in full control of your learning pace.

# Why Should You Bother with Time Codes?

Because traditional productivity hacks are like putting a band-aid on a leaky faucet. They work for a while, then you‚Äôre back to old habits. *Time Codes - Wyatt Woodsmall* is different. It tackles the **psychological side of time**, helping you understand how *you* think and feel about time. Once you know your patterns, you can actually change them‚Äîfor good. That‚Äôs the real magic. Wyatt shows you how to take control of your time from the inside out.

# How Does It All Work?

You‚Äôll go through concepts like **mental triggers, time perception, and behavior change techniques** that help you ditch distractions, stay motivated, and get stuff done efficiently. Wyatt keeps things practical‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be drowning in theory. He walks you through tools and strategies that are surprisingly easy to apply but super powerful once you make them habits.

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôve ever said, *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough time,‚Äù* you need this course in your life. *Time Codes - Wyatt Woodsmall* isn‚Äôt just about productivity‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a new relationship with time itself.

1k113mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1k113mr/father_was_defrauded_20k_in_cerb_payments/,Father was defrauded 20K in CERB payments,"I‚Äôll start this by saying that my dad has always been very very illiterate with his money. To the point where when my mother and him were together, they had one debit card and she controlled the finances. He also lived rent free with his parents for a decade, while making 70K a year, rent free, and he managed to save 10K in that time frame. Also, he obviously hasn‚Äôt filed his taxes in a few years. So, you get the gist. 

My father is also an immigrant and about 7 years ago he lost his wallet with his SIN, IDs and Canadian citizenship card. I know, trust me. Idiot. 

Anyhow, he *frequently* gets letters from Revenue Canada and he never opens them. Like he must have 20+ sitting on his coffee table. 

This is where it gets great! He finds out that someone took out 20K in CERB payments, under his name, opened a bank account with his name, and cashed them all. The account is now closed and the bank has been useless. He finds this out because his employer gets a letter saying that his wages must be garnished to pay this back. He obviously starts freaking out and has now hired an accountant to help him with the CRA. His wages are now being garnished because the CRA is saying he did not contact them soon enough (fair) but obviously he cannot afford this. 

Give it to me straight, is he on the hook for this entire amount even though he can prove it wasn‚Äôt him? I‚Äôve also signed him up for Equifax monitoring now (which he should have done years ago). Looking to see if anyone‚Äôs experienced anything similar.

1k112ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k112ib/am_i_the_asshole_for_cutting_off_my_dad/,Am I The Asshole For Cutting Off My Dad?,"I'm going to preface this by saying if the rare chance that some big redit storytelling channel does find this post, I must ask that you don't make a video on it or mention it unless you find it in 2029 when I will be a legal adult and out of my situation. On to the story, I am currently a 14-year-old freshman in high school but this story will go back to times I was younger. I will do my best to date the stories but there will likely be quite a bit of human error. I will also be using fake names for privacy reasons.

The people involved are my older brother, Liam who is 17 and his mom is a deadbeat out of the picture; my younger brother, David who is 9 and Alice's kid; my dad who is 33; my dad's current fiancee, Amanda who is 23; my ex-step mother, Alice; dads ex #1, Nina; ex #2, Moly; Nina's daughter, Elly; and my mom.

I do love my dad, I truly do, he is someone I can look back in the past and remember happy memories of the two of us. He is not perfect though, the first signs I could have picked up on were how ever since he and my mom broke up he constantly down-talked her and attempted to put her in a bad light. My mom refrained from doing the same. That in itself would have never been enough to make me take such drastic measures. It started when my now-ex-stepmom got a job as a trucker and was away from home a lot, leaving my dad as a stay-at-home husband (I am now old enough to understand this was to avoid paying child support). My dad claimed to have felt lonely so he proposed the idea of a poly relationship with a girl he met online, Nina. Nina was a girl who was 19 and in a bad home environment. I don't know the exact details but she had cut off contact with her parents. Over the time I was at my mom's house Nina and Elly moved in. This was when I was in 6th grade and 11 years old. I was young and happy to have a new person around so I welcomed her with open arms and would make her cookies and anything sweet because she had gotten covid and really only liked spicy and sweet foods due to losing her sense of taste. It didn't affect me much but my older brother Liam was left to take care of four-year-old Elly. Alice didn't argue at the time and that was how we lived for 5 months. I started to notice how my dad favored Nina over Alice and started to actively show favoritism towards Alice to balance it out. During this time I grew closer with Alice while we had previously been distant. Then Moly came who was ""just friends"" with dad. She had just broken up with her boyfriend and needed a place to stay so dad offered. I also became very close with her. Dad would often kiss her and I later found out because she had no where else to go she would let my dad do whatever he wanted. Eventually, Alice asked my dad to become monogamous again because the favoritism made her uncomfortable. They moved out and dad agreed but kept messaging Nina in secret. A year later when I was then 12 Alice found out and they got a divorce. Since then Alice has gotten primary custody of David. They moved a state over since and dad has custody in the summer. Things we great for about two months, dad had much more time to spend with us and we felt like a family again. Then his newest girlfriend, Amanda, came. At first, she would drive me to school in the mornings on Monday and we would get coffee. I'm not a coffee person but it was still nice and I liked her quite a bit. She was like an aunt to me; this was when I was in the 8th grade and 12. Then within one month, she moved in. It was fine at first but quickly things changed. Almost every night I could hear her and my dad having sex and any trace of Alice was thrown away and replaced. They re-decorated the entire house. My dad and Amanda do not do well with head-on confrontations so I tried wording it as a joke to try and fix the issue of hearing them. I playfully said, ""Make sure to keep the noise down tonight, wouldn't want to hurt any young ears."" They laughed it off and said, ""You're 12, you've said and heard much worse."" I figured that would be it but the noise didn't stop. I just started putting on headphones and listening to music but I can't sleep with earbuds in because I'm a side sleeper. But that was something I could deal with, I'd just have to deal with being sleepy in the mornings and a little grouchy. They also stayed up til 2:am watching loud movies and also didn't stop when I asked again. But that was fine. I'd live with it. Then Amanda ""jokingly"" said she'd be even louder with dad when I accidentally ate some leftovers in the fridge I wasn't supposed to as ""punishment."" My dad did nothing to stop this. Amanda was very protective about her food and got mad if anyone ate the wrong thing. Added context is that they had a whole 5ft by 4ft mini fridge in their room. But that would have been fine if she labeled her food or even sent a text saying ""Don't eat this"", but she didn't. Instead, she'd yell at us if we ate the wrong thing. I'm not generally confrontational and I'm the type to cry when yelled at. I eventually just stopped eating there and only ate if the food had been deliberately made for us kids. This is why I stopped bringing up issues because she turned them into a weapon against me. Even that was fine and something I could deal with. Dad spent nearly all his time with her, they both have co-dependency of some kind, even when apart they'd call constantly. I have a rule with myself and not one anyone has given to me, no phone in the car, the car is the place I get to talk with my mom and dad because we have a 45-minute drive between their houses. I used to talk to dad during this time but he was always on the phone with Amanda. The only thing he'd talk about was politics. But still, it was fine. He started forcing me to hang out with the family and I would have done it willingly if he didn't have us do it at 10pm. I have school and I like to make up at 4-5:am. He would force me to stay up till 1:am sometimes and obviously, I was tired and upset. I ended up snapping at them a good few times and I honestly almost cried a few times because I knew this would cause me to be exhausted at school the next day as he even made me do it on Sunday nights. I was exhausted and frustrated but when I tried to talk to him he told me I was being ""A bitch"" and that the world didn't revolve around me. I started locking myself in my room at 6:pm pretending to be asleep so he'd leave me alone even if it meant skipping dinner. One time he made me stay up till 2:am the night before my school concert and I was so exhausted I fell asleep as soon as I got home and slept through the entire thing. I love singing very much and due to missing it I had to write a two-page paper. I genuinely cried over this but still I hadn't even considered cutting contact. Then Amanda started making jokes about me and my oldest brother Liam. Me and my brother were very close at the time. Me and him were play fighting and I was tickling him. Amanda said it looked sexual so we stopped and have never done it since but she still jokes about us getting intimate. We have now grown much more distant. I have a very hard time picking up on sarcasm and being able to tell when people are lying to me. Amanda and my dad made a joke of telling lies to me. They told me she was pregnant with twins and I believed her for 9 months. She told me her and my dad were half-siblings and she still says so. She jokes about my dad grooming her but as they met when she was 16 and he was her boss in an ice cream shop it doesn't seem like a joke at all. It's actually quite uncomfortable to realize all the women my dad has been with were all estranged from their parents and in need of a home. My dad also tends to make uncomfortable comments about my body. I have developed rather early and have been a C-cup since 7th grade and I'm now an F-cup. I have a rather ""desirable"" body as I have what most would call an hourglass figure. My dad would make comments on it. When I was 12 he told me he could tell any girl's cup size and I said I didn't believe him. He proceeded to cup my chest and uncomfortable as it was guess my size. Another time I decided I wanted to dress up for myself and look nice so I was walking around in a simple black dress. I knocked on my dad's door to ask him for something and when he saw me he looked me up and down and said ""Damn..."" in that drawn-out way guys do. I hated it. He also recently made a comment about it looking like I was losing weight and complimenting me on it. But even then I didn't intend to leave. Liam needed new pants and dad always complained about being too broke to get any but then rented out an entire movie theater for him and Amanda's one-year anniversary. He always does this, spoiling his girlfriend and not giving Liam what he needs. I can handle him neglecting me because I have my mom who I absolutely adore. She isn't perfect but she is all I could ask for. I have support where he doesn't. My dad pierced my ears himself and the night after he pierced them one fell out and I knocked on his door to get a replacement so the hole wouldn't close he was too busy having sex with Amanda to answer the door and I ended up staying up until 2:am waiting. When he did answer the door Amanda was mad at me for 'killing the mood' and when he put them back in it was too late so he ended up scarring my ears which are still scarred. Even then, I didn't want to leave. But two months ago I experienced a panic attack, they run in the family on my dad's side. I texted my mom because I was freaking out and I felt like I couldn't breathe. Mom told me to tell my dad because she was an hour away and couldn't help. I stood outside my dad's door pacing trying to work up the courage but I couldn't bring myself to knock on his door. At the time I was sick and didn't know I was having a panic attack, I just knew I could barely breathe and felt like I was gonna pass out I ended up taking some decongestant medicine and locking myself in the bathroom where I cried and hyperventilated until it passed. That night something clicked, in what felt like a life or death situation at the time I couldn't bring myself to reach out to my dad. I do love my dad but he is not someone I trust and not someone I can reach out to when I seriously need it. I decided not to go back that weekend. I just couldn't. It was all too much and I just couldn't. I told my mom I wasn't willing to go back and she talked me into taking a one-month break and discussing solutions where I could see him less or other ways to rebuild the relationship. I agreed not to do anything too rash and this is the text conversation quoted directly with zero edits or typo corrections outside of name changes.

Me:Dear dad,
I am writing to tell you I will not be going to your house for all of March. I need some time to think over what I can handle and what I need. We have grown distant and I believe you are aware of this. I am not writing this to tell you I hate you and I am not writing this in malice but as things are, I am emotionally struggling to see the positives in going to your house and due to this I need some space. Please do not try to come and pick me up from moms on Friday and for the rest of March. Please try to understand what I'm trying to do and think of my needs before responding.
Love me. 7:27pm

Dad:Why do you think we have grown distant? 7:30pm

Is there somthing I have done wrong that has hurt you in some way? 7:31pm

As you have given no reason at all. I'll see you Friday as the court order dictates. I understand you have grown distant over the  last 6 months. We can have a sit down and a real conversation about our feeling this weekend. But unless you want me out of your life forever and your mom is willing to stop child support and take full custody with me signing my rights away because you have grown to hate me for some reason. We can talk this weekend. 7:57pm

Me:As I have stated previously, I do not hate you. I just need some time so as I have stated I will not be comming to your house this weekend or any others for March. 8:01pm

Dad:You are a 14 year old child and I am a pernent with a court order. You can ask me with a reason. But I make the rules. You do not. Your an emotional 14 year old girl and if these are the choices you want to make without even giving a reason. I will be a parent and tell you that you will be coming you don't have a choice. You may need a parent in your life now that you are getting older and I'm not there enough. 8:09pm

Me:I have attempted this conversation in person many times and and now over text. I can seen this time will not be productive aswell and I am not interested in fighting over this. You can not physical force me to go anywhere. I think it is time I hand this conversation over to the adults. But that does not mean I am handing over my voice. I just have said what I need to say. 8:16pm

Dad What conversation.. you haven't stated a single concern. 8:20pm

I will arrive with the police. I won't have to force anything. A child has no choice whatsoever. They will enforce the court order. If you and your mother don't cowoperate, she can be arrested and that will be on you.  Maybe you should tell me what conversation you have tried to have. 8:23pm

Best guess I have is you got a girlfriend and would prefer to hang out with her and are making up issues to fit your narrative in a manipulative way 8:25pm

You could even try calling and having a conversation. I always call first and make the first attempt. I suggest games and movies. I call and tell you I love you. You never make a first move. You respond or don't. Our relationship is super one sided I do for you try to engage and spend time with you and you give less and less back. Why are you so cold.  8:29pm

Are you ready to have any kind of conversation. Or do you still want to shut me out. I have no idea what the problem even is . You haven't told me anything. It's not some kind of visitation.  Your mother and I have split custody. Your mother has primary placement because you go to school there. But my home is no less Your home and your mother's. You say you are having trouble seeing positives. I see meals togeather time with your father and brother family games and movies. Conversation. I know you are distant and try to avoid us alot. And I give you space because your a teenage girl. Maybe that was a bad choice. I want to know what problem you have. If or when you want to see me again and where this flawed perception of family is coming from. Like a teenager can wake up one day and choose to break up with her family.. you can move out and choose when and if you spend time with them at 18. When you have a job and a car and it ist their responsibility to care for you. Financially physically and through teaching.
But the idea that you think this is how things work tells me how immature you are and how little you are ready to make adult decisions. 8:40pm

Me As I have stated previously, if you come to my house I will not be comming with you. I have made my need for space clear and you immediately going on to barratt me only goes to show why I need this space. I am old enough to make choices for myself and the choice of taking space is a right I have that you can not take away. I did not say I intended to cut you off completely, I simply wont be coming to your house for March. Please do not come to my house as I will not go with you. 4:31pm the next day

Dad I have to come to document that I am not breaking my court order. Whether you like it or not. I will have to have the police come and take note that you and your mother are refusing the custody arrangement and are in contempt of court. This simply isn't a choice we get to make living with your parents is an obligation of children and their parents to care for them. You can refuse im sure but the cops will have to come and make a report. As those reports add up I will have grounds to go to court and adjust to full custody then there won't be any arguments. 4:35pm

He then added a screenshot of google that was searching what would happen if an ex held a child against cort order. The restults are different when a child id refusing to go so it is unnecessary and he was using it to try and make me believe I was on the wrong side of the law.

These are just the rules we are together required to follow. If you won't to work on whatever problems you have you are unwilling to communicate we can sit down and do so 4:39pm

It's just not optional for either one of us.  Custody arrangements can be adjusted between your mother and myself. You aren't one of the 2 decision makers in this process. 4:41pm

And she hasn't said a word to me. 4:42

Me:You and Amanda make sexual incest jokes about me and Liam and it is incredibly disgusting. I will not come to your house. 5:16pm

Dad: Joking that you guys do cute couple things like paint eachothers nails is not in any way an explicit sexual joke. That kind of joke and sexual talk like that isn't tolerated at my house. We can all sit down and talk about your emotional sensitivity toward anything that offends you and have everyone agree on what might be triggers for you to be avoided in humor or other conversation. 5:22pm

See you in an hour5:22pm

There has never been a joke pertaining to anything perverse. Nothing sexual in nature pertaining to sex or sexual organs. Only the 2 of you doing couple things. And if you are offended and don't want it to happen.. all you have to do is ask. It's as good as done and happened rarely to begain with. 5:28pm

Me: You guys said me and Morgan were going to end up following in you and Annas' footsteps when me and Morgan were play wrestling acting as if me and Morgan were gonna fuck. That was gross. No matter how you twist it it is disgusting. I don't care what you say, I'm not comming. Do not come because I will not come with you. 5:32pm

Dad: I don't have a choice. I'm not twisting anything. And I can't even remember the last time you and Morgan wrestled. Also the joke is Anna and I are so similar it's like we were twins separated at birth. We aren't related. I'll be there at 6:30ish. The court order is law.. literally. If you have any issue with that you can have your mother contact me and we can handle it legally 5:35pm

Me: I am not comming. I know my rights. Do not come. 5:37pm

Dad: Your mother and I decide your rights. Your a 14 year old child. There are the right to follow your parents instructions or throw a fit... that's all 5:38pm

Me: When you and the police officer arive I am going to explain how uncomfortable I am with your innuendos. You're waisting your gass, stay home. 4:47pm

We are meeting with a lawyer Monday.4:48pm

Dad:For all I know your mother will be gone weekends this month and you wanna be unsupervised to hang with friends. I come unless I hear otherwise from her period. She is the parent not you 5:48pm

Me:Then talk to her! I Already said I was handing this situation to the adults. I am perfectly cared for at moms unlike at your house. Also don't talk about me being alone all weekend because that's all I do at your house. 5:51pm

Dad: Alone till the parent gets home from work is how all children live. For the longest time your mother worked while you were at grandma or grandpa's house. If you feel incapable of hanging out with your brother till I'm home from work I will get you a sitter 5:53pm

Do you have an actual issue we can talk about or is it just your 14 and want to be 18. 5:54pm

If you want me to talk to your mother have her message me. I'm leaving work in 6 minutes and I'll be there soon 5:55pm

Me: I said I'm not comming and you can't make me. Comming will only waist your gas. Don't come. 5:56pm

Dad: As soon as your mother messages me ill consider it 5:57pm

Ok your mom messaged me. She let me know you feel unsafe at my house. If some joke I don't remember told over the summer. The last time you and your brother wrestled.
Makes you feel unsafe. In spite of the fact that there has never been any physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse.
Or abuse, otherwise. I will file this with the police and you don't have to see me. She will be filing in court on monday.In hopes that i don't have to be part of your life anymore.
If that's how you feel, i'm sorry I failed you so. Terribly as a father 6:17pm

Am I overreacting? Everyone says this isn't okay and it doesn't feel okay and I'm tired of crying all the time because it's all just too much but I don‚Äôt know if I'm being hormonal and dramatic. I just feel so disconnected with reality and like I'm living another life. I'm turning 15 in just a few months and it's all so confusing. I don‚Äôt want a dad who threatens to give up his rights for me. Is this normal? I feel horrible because I don‚Äôt regret it. I miss him and my brothers but it just wasn't worth it. I feel like a weight is off my shoulders and I'm starting to question if something is wrong with me. It shouldn't feel this easy to cut him off but at the same time I cry every tome something reminds me of him or my brothers. I've just been an emotional mess and my only real coping mechanism is keeping busy with school and volunteering. I've done 60 hours community service, I've been a straight A student all year, and I'm being put in an art show next Wednesday. I just feel fake, like the only things about me that are actually good are my achievements. I feel like a bad person and I feel like something is wrong with me. I feel sad and angry but it feels like the wrong kind of angry amd sad. I've been called apathetic in the past but I'm starting to really believe something is wrong with me. And I being dramatic?

In section 3 unit 24 in Japanese, a multiple choice question is impossible to pass, since all of the 4 options are regarded as wrong, resulting in loss of 1 heart. To make sure I even refilled my hearts for 600 gems, so I got to try all 4 answers again (spending the 5th heart on the correct answer one more time). 

I almost signed up for a free trial to see what Explain my mistake would have to say on this, but decided against that when it turned out the free trial cannot be started without providing a payment method. 

Still, as seen in the screenshot, the correct sentence is identical to the answer I selected (the Japanese word for coffee), so I would not be surprised if Explain my mistake could not explain this anyway.

It then also turned out that the contactform to report a bug has a submitbutton that does not submit the feedback, and instead does nothing.

As a result, I can now no longer make any progress with the lessons. If I had to input the answer by keyboard I might still have had some doubt, that maybe I input the characters incorrectly despite showing up exactly as also shown in the answer Duo claims to be correct. With this type of multiple choice question however, there is no room for doubt left‚Ä¶ all 4 out of 4 possible options result in a penalty.

Yeah, been there, done that. It seems like stress sneaks up on us at the worst times, leaving us frazzled. But what if there was a ridiculously simple way to hit the pause button and calm those pesky stress hormones? 

Enter, stage left: **The 2-Minute Breathing Hack!** üå¨Ô∏èüîç

I stumbled upon this little gem when I was deep in a YouTube rabbit hole (anyone else?). And guess what? Scientists actually back this up! Apparently, just two minutes a day can slash your cortisol levels by up to 30%‚Äîkind of awesome, right? üòä 

So, here's the scoop on what I did for the past 7 days:

- **Morning Breather**: Right after waking up, I sat up in bed, closed my eyes, and breathed deeply. *Inhale for four seconds... hold... exhale for eight seconds.* Just 10 rounds of this, and I already felt a bit more zen.
  
- **Midday Reset**: When the office chaos hit, I excused myself for a two-minute ""bathroom break"" (we all do it üòÇ). Sat in a quiet corner, and repeated that breathing exercise. It‚Äôs surprisingly refreshing to just... breathe.

- **Evening Wind-Down**: Before diving into my Netflix ritual, another round of deep breaths. Somehow, it made unwinding so much more enjoyable. 

Confession: At first, staring at a timer felt a bit silly. But by Day 3, I was looking forward to these little breathing breaks like they were tiny mental vacations.

So, did this hack magically make all my problems disappear? Nope. Did it make me less jumpy when the barista messed up my coffee order? Definitely. üòÜ

I‚Äôm not saying this is a magic bullet, but there‚Äôs something oddly powerful about reclaiming just two minutes for yourself. It almost feels like a mini act of rebellion against stress.

What about you all? Anyone else got some quick and quirky stress-busting tricks? How do you keep your sanity in a world that‚Äôs always buzzing with chaos? Would love to know if any of you have tried similar hacks!

I tried to go off meds and it worked for 7 years. Then I started smoking weed and was in a toxic relationship, along with other stressors such as work, school, a mortgage as a woman that was barely being supported by her partner. Mom had to chip in a lot and just found that weed was drowning out the noise but not letting me face my reality until one day the racing thoughts, lack of sleep, and then inevitably psychosis began to kick in. I was just fine the week prior. It literally switched within several days of little sleep while smoking weed and having a ridiculous amount of coffee to stay awake (they literally do the opposite effect, but it was my way to feel creative & stimulated) all it did was made me sleep and feel like I wasn't alone with my self conscious when I was isolating more than ever before.

Any Bipolar 1 people off the meds and have found what has worked for them? I think I am going to stay on Lamictal as the safer option for now. But, I know what these meds can do in the long run and it makes me feel hopeless. I already have what my neurologist calls ""physiological tremors"" but they were straight up from a bad cocktail from a shyt ton of meds during my first rodeo, newly diagnosed, with little doctor oversight over-seeing the transfer of meds from different facilities that scarred me for life.

I'm currently on Lamictal 200mg & just went up from Latuda 20mg to 40mg because I've been depressed for three months after my manic episode, and praying that I will be okay because mania is no joke, especially with freakin psychosis. I still get ideastions so I thought the increase could help because my dosage is so low but still keep it from being too high. I'm trying my best to be super conservative but where I feel that they're working. I ask God why almost each day. I see people with a life worth living and I am struggling to see mine as such.

Please try not to freak me out on me and say something crazy about the meds. I'm just seeking advice on other holistic options that have helped people with my condition if I choose to reduce to just one pill with no antipsychotic because bravery for me right now is taking them since my entire support system, doctors, & research is telling me so. Yet, I'm mainly doing it for me and my family. My family would be devastated if I quit them and they love me the most so why would they want something so bad for me if they didn't think it was the right choice? ""It takes time to find the right ones is what they all say"". It's an uphill battle and hoping the meds can at least help me cope to get to where I want to be and am having faith the bad stuff won't come with it. I can't have my cake and eat it too because I have a legit condition I have to treat, ya know? :/ This is why I cry. I find my tremors and fears to be secondary as compared to what could happen again without the meds now because the hospitals and depression after math are the absolute worse and don't want to permanently damage my brain to no return from it getting that out of control since it has happened like this three times in a decade.

Hi all, so I‚Äôve officially started part 1 of my IVF journey which is taking birth control pills today (I‚Äôve never taken this in my life so it feels like a starting milestone in the journey). 

Anyways, my RE estimated 5/3 to begin stims & est. week of 5/12 for retrieval, and I was hoping for some feedback/advice/suggestions before I start. I know & have read hundreds of comments from other posts but can‚Äôt remember where I read them & losing track. Here are some questions I have, feel free to answer any or all. Thank you in advance! 

1. Anything I should get or do to organize all of the medications? I‚Äôve seen people get a cart to store everything 

2. Tips & tricks for the injections. Leading up to this month, I was insanely stressed bc I‚Äôm terrified of needles but have been calm in the last week or so with an ‚Äúit is what it is mindset‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll change when I have to actually do it. Also, has anyone seen or bought the Dandi kit & is it worth it? 

3. What should I be eating/drinking starting now? Or anything that you feel has helped? (I.e. Pom juice or pineapples). Someone‚Äôs journey I follow on tik tok has been drinking pomegranate powder in place of coffee, which is interesting. I‚Äôve also started taking coq10 a few months ago, stopped for a month, and restarted recently. 

4. What to truly expect? I‚Äôm going into this thinking I‚Äôll have to do at least 2 cycles. I‚Äôm 33 with a .6 AMH & AFC between 5-10. Also will be using sperm donor. Dr suggested IUI (with sperm donor in the mix) but I felt IVF would be the better route

Laughter and chatter mixed with the soft clinking of glasses as the guests smiled, raising their drinks in celebration. It was a beautiful night‚Äîone that should have been mine.

I stood there in a flowing white dress, my hands curled slightly at my sides. My eyes stayed on the man in front of me.

Ethan.

He wore a black suit, his smile easy and charming. He nodded as people congratulated him, his expression filled with happiness.

For a moment, I wanted to believe this was for me. That this was our special night. A surprise he had prepared for me.

But sadly, it wasn‚Äôt.

The proposal party I had dreamed of, the moment I had longed for, was unfolding before my eyes, but I was not the one in the spotlight. I was merely the pianist, playing background music for the celebration of another couple.

I closed my eyes, forcing the sharp pain in my heart to fade. The moment I reopened them, the sight before me burned into my soul like a hot coal. My fingers trembled over the piano keys as I forced myself to watch the man I loved‚Äîmy boyfriend‚Äîkneeling before another woman.

No. Not just any couple.

Him.

And her.

The cheers of the crowd swelled around me, accompanied by the clinking of champagne glasses and the scent of sweet desserts. The luxurious banquet hall glowed under golden chandeliers, its walls adorned with hydrangeas‚Äîthe very flowers that once held special meaning between us.

If only I had known.

If only I had known that this was the proposal party for Miss Celeste Rothwell, the most favored daughter of the Rothwell family. If only I had known that the generous wages and hefty tips being promised tonight came at the cost of my dignity, I would have never taken this job.

But I hadn‚Äôt known.

And now, I was trapped in this nightmare, forced to witness my world crumble before me while my fingers danced over the keys, weaving a melody too beautiful for such a wretched occasion.

My gaze flickered to the hydrangeas decorating the hall, and a memory came rushing back, raw and vivid.

A quiet street bathed in moonlight. The distant hum of music from the lively party we had escaped. The warmth of his hand in mine as we walked, laughing softly. The streets had been lined with hydrangeas, their petals swaying in the night breeze.

And then‚Äîhis voice, soft and full of promise.

""My beautiful Skylar, will you marry me? I will make you happy and never betray you.""

I had laughed, thinking he was joking, but then he plucked a single hydrangea and held it to my chest, his gaze tender and sincere.

""I'm serious, Skylar. You‚Äôre the only one for me‚Ä¶ no one else but you.""

I had believed him.

I had believed every single word.

Now, that same voice filled the banquet hall, but this time, it wasn‚Äôt calling out to me.

""Celeste, my love, will you marry me?""

A sharp pang shot through my heart. My fingers faltered, hitting the wrong note. The discordant sound echoed through the hall like a crack in the perfect moment.

Silence immediately followed. All eyes turned toward me, as if I was a plague about to ruin the perfect moment, but none were as piercing as his.

A warning look. A silent command.

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced myself to continue playing, my hands shaking as they returned to the familiar keys.

I tried not to look, but my eyes betrayed me.

He was kneeling before her, a velvet box in his hand. The ring inside gleamed under the chandelier‚Äôs light.

Immediately he opened the velvet box, my breath caught in my throat.

I knew that ring!

The complex knot design, the careful arrangement of gemstones‚Äîthere was no mistaking it.

It was the ring I had painstakingly designed.

I had spent weeks perfecting it, pouring my heart and soul into every detail. I had wanted it to be special, a symbol of our love, a one-of-a-kind masterpiece meant for no one else but me.

I still remembered the way he had stared at my design, his fingers tracing over the sketch for what felt like hours.

""A beautiful ring like this shouldn‚Äôt just stay on paper, Skylar,"" he had said, his eyes filled with admiration. ""It should be worn by a special and amazing woman. It should be real.""

And I had let him take the design.

Because I had trusted him. Because I had loved him.

My vision blurred as I watched Celeste Rothwell extend her soft hand, allowing him to slip the ring‚Äîthe ring that was supposed to be mine‚Äîonto her finger.

Applause erupted around me. The guests cheered, celebrating their love, oblivious to the silent scream in my heart.

I wanted to rush forward, to rip that ring off her hand, to shatter every last trace of this betrayal. I wanted to yell and scream that the ring should have been worn by me! I should be the one getting proposed to by the customized ring I had painstakingly designed myself!

But I couldn‚Äôt.

Because I knew deep down, I was nothing compared to her.

Celeste Rothwell‚Äîthe beloved daughter of the Rothwell family, the woman who had everything I had lost.

And me?

I was just Skylar McLair, the daughter of a bankrupt businessman, a woman barely holding on after her father‚Äôs accident destroyed everything.

No one would believe me.

No one would care.

The moment my performance ended, I stepped away from the piano, my fingers curling into fists at my sides. The crowd was too enraptured by the newly engaged couple to notice my retreat.

I walked down the corridor, my steps quick and unsteady. The dim lighting helped me hide my misery, but it could not hide the anger boiling in my veins.

A choked sob escaped my mouth, and in a burst of uncontrollable rage, I swung my fist against the wall.

Pain shot through my knuckles, but it was nothing compared to the agony tearing me apart inside.

How could he do this to me? How could Ethan betray me this way? After all the years we'd spent together? After all the promises made?

Why? Why? Why?!

I clenched my teeth and raised my fist again, desperate for some kind of release‚Äî

But suddenly, a deep, amused chuckle echoed through the corridor.

I froze.

Someone was there.

I turned sharply, my breath hitching as I scanned around my surroundings. A dark figure leaned casually against the wall a few feet away, half-shrouded in shadow.

I couldn‚Äôt make out his face, but the way he stood, his arms crossed and his posture relaxed, sent a wave of unease through me.

Had he been watching me all this time?

How much had he seen? I didn‚Äôt even wait to find out.

I turned and quickly hurried away, my heart pounding.

I had already been humiliated enough for one night.

I wasn‚Äôt about to let a stranger witness my complete and utter breakdown.

Chapter 2

Skylar

I ignored the ringing phone for the hundredth time.

Ethan. Again.

The name flashing on my screen made my stomach turn. I clenched my fists, taking a deep breath to control my emotions.

For days, he had been calling relentlessly. I had blocked his number once, but he simply found new ones to reach me.

Why was he doing this? What more did he want after everything he had done?

I turned my phone face-down on the table and focused on my work, trying to drown out the thoughts clawing at my mind. But the phone rang again. And again. And again.

I gritted my teeth angrily. After countless calls, I finally snapped. I grabbed the phone and answered sharply.

‚ÄúWhat do you want, Ethan?‚Äù

A pause. Then, a chuckle‚Äîsoft, familiar, but no longer comforting as it used to be.

‚ÄúSkylar,‚Äù he said, my name slowly rolling off his tongue. ‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear from you. Stop calling me,‚Äù I said coldly.

He sighed, as if I were the one being unreasonable. ‚ÄúI just want to talk. Let‚Äôs meet at our favorite coffee shop.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason for us to meet, Ethan,‚Äù I spat angrily. ‚ÄúWe have nothing to say to each other. I have nothing to say to you.‚Äù

He ignored my words. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll come see you at home.‚Äù

My blood ran cold.

Mum

Since my father‚Äôs accident, her mental state had been fragile. The last thing she needed was Ethan showing up and causing trouble.

For her sake, I needed to make sure Ethan wouldn't come to the house. Seeing him might cause her more pain.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúOne meeting. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said, sounding satisfied.

I hung up before he could say anything else.

Forty-five minutes later, I arrived at the coffee shop. As I stepped inside, my eyes instinctively found him. Ethan was sitting at our old table by the window, the place where we had spent countless afternoons together.

I forced myself forward, walking slowly to keep my emotions intact. When I reached the table, I immediately noticed he had already brought my favorite coffee.

The sight of it, sitting there as if nothing had changed, made my stomach churn. Ethan finally looked up and smiled.

""Skylar,"" he said smoothly. ‚ÄúHow are -‚Äù

Before he could continue, I cut him off. ""Don't ask how I‚Äôve been,"" I said coldly. ""You don‚Äôt need to pretend you care.""

His lips parted slightly, but I didn‚Äôt give him a chance to respond. Rather, I just sank into the seat across from him.

""You don‚Äôt have to worry about me pestering you, Ethan,"" I continued in a sharp voice. ""I already know what you want to talk about. I‚Äôll stay away from you and disappear from your life. I won‚Äôt get in your way. You have nothing to worry about.""

For a brief moment, something flickered across his face‚Äîan emotion I couldn't quite place. But then, he shook his head and smiled. That same infuriating, self-assured smile that used to make my heart skip a beat.

‚ÄúYou look well.‚Äù

I scoffed. ‚ÄúCut the small talk, Ethan.‚Äù

His smile didn‚Äôt falter, but something flickered in his eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to disappear from my life, Skylar.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to understand his words.

‚ÄúAre you joking?‚Äù

He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm engaged to Celeste, yes. But that doesn‚Äôt mean my feelings for you just vanished; I still love you, Skylar.‚Äù

A bitter laugh escaped me. ‚ÄúOh, so you still ‚Äòlove‚Äô me?‚Äù I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúTell me, Ethan, is that what you were telling yourself when you proposed to her?‚Äù

His jaw tightened, but his voice remained smooth. ‚ÄúYou and I have been together for so long, Skylar. I can‚Äôt just forget you.‚Äù

I curled my fingers into my palm, my nails digging into my skin.

I wanted to scream at him. To tell him that HE was the one who had shattered everything we had together. HE was the one who betrayed me and ruined our relationship! It was all him!

But I refused to give him that satisfaction. Not now. Not ever.

‚ÄúYou broke up with me,‚Äù I reminded him, my voice steady. ‚ÄúYou betrayed me. You lied to me. And now, after humiliating me in front of everyone, you expect me to‚Äîwhat? Stay by your side like a loyal pet?‚Äù

Ethan sighed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so dramatic, Skylar.‚Äù

I clenched my teeth. ‚ÄúDramatic?‚Äù

Ethan reached out, his fingers about to brush my cheeks as he often did whenever he wanted to coax me into something. I stepped back instinctively, my skin crawling at the thought of his touch.

His voice was low, coaxing, as if he were offering me something precious.

‚ÄúSkylar, I want you to be my lover.‚Äù

I instantly stiffened.

‚ÄúI can take good care of you,‚Äù he continued smoothly. ‚ÄúIf you agree, you won‚Äôt have to struggle anymore. I‚Äôll get you a house, a car‚Äîeverything you need. And your father... he‚Äôll get the best treatment, I promise.‚Äù

My heart pounded, not with hope, but with total disbelief.

I had thought I‚Äôd heard everything. Thought he couldn‚Äôt possibly sink lower. But this?

He wasn‚Äôt asking for forgiveness. He wasn‚Äôt trying to make amends.

He was offering to buy me.

Something inside me cracked.

I forced myself to breathe, my vision blurring with rage.

Ethan sighed, as if he were the one burdened by this situation. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that. I‚Äôm not the one to blame here. If you want to be angry at someone, blame your father.‚Äù

My fingers tightened around the edge of the table at the mention of my father.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the one who ruined everything,‚Äù Ethan continued smoothly. ‚ÄúIf he hadn‚Äôt gone bankrupt, things would have been different. You would still be‚Äî‚Äù He stopped, shaking his head with a small, amused smile. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs the past. I‚Äôve found the perfect solution for you, Skylar.‚Äù

I felt like I had been punched in the gut.

My hands trembled beneath the table.

I should blame my father?

‚ÄúYou must have noticed by now,‚Äù he went on, leaning back in his seat. ‚ÄúPeople in our circle want nothing to do with you. They avoid you like the plague. You have no status, no support. No one will help you.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly, watching my reaction. ‚ÄúNo one except me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äî‚Äù My voice shook. ‚ÄúDo you even hear yourself, Ethan? Do you really think I would agree to something this despicable? What do you take me for?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should be grateful, Skylar,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here and also do care about you.‚Äù

Grateful?

I wanted to scream. To throw the table over. To slap that smug look off his face.

Instead, I stood up abruptly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs hand shot out, gripping my wrist. His touch burned like poison.

‚ÄúYou should rethink this,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no longer a rich lady, Skylar. You no longer belong to the elite class. Without your parents' protection, you should learn how to survive.‚Äù

I met his gaze, my heart rising and falling with barely controlled anger.

‚ÄúI may have nothing, Ethan. But I still have my dignity.‚Äù

He chuckled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúDignity won‚Äôt feed you.‚Äù

I yanked my wrist from his grasp, stepping back. But before I could turn away, he spoke again.

‚ÄúI remember your mother had a jewelry design studio,‚Äù he said lazily. ‚ÄúWhat would happen if it disappeared?‚Äù

My heart stopped.

A wave of cold terror washed over me.

He wouldn‚Äôt.

I searched his expression, hoping to find a hint of bluffing, but all I saw was a quiet, sharp amusement.

I trembled, my hands balling into fists.

Ethan had always been manipulative, but this‚Ä¶ this was something else.

A dangerous kind of rage took over me. My body moved before I could think.

I grabbed the steaming cup of coffee from the table and, with all the strength I had, threw it at him.

It splashed onto his face and hair, staining his expensive suit. Gasps and murmurs erupted around us.

Ethan ducked back, cursing, his eyes darkening with fury.

And I didn‚Äôt wait for his reaction.

I turned and ran out of the caf√©, ignoring the stares, the whispers, and the sound of his chair scraping against the floor.

Chapter 3

Cole

Xander stirred his espresso and suddenly nudged my arm. ‚ÄúDo you know her?‚Äù he asked.

I didn‚Äôt respond right away, my gaze still fixed on the scene unfolding before me.

Xander let out a low chuckle. ""Cole. I‚Äôve never seen you look at a woman like that before. No matter how beautiful she is, you don‚Äôt have to keep staring.‚Äù His eyes narrowed playfully. ‚ÄúWhen did you start taking an interest in anything other than business?""

I pulled my gaze away from the scene across the caf√© and smirked. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect to see such a good show right after coming back.‚Äù

It had been years since I last set foot in New York, but some things never changed. The people, the conversations, the social hierarchy that governed this city‚Äîit was all the same.

Xander followed my line of sight, and the moment he spotted the man standing there, his expression shifted.

""Wait a second. Why is your stepbrother here? Didn‚Äôt he just propose to the daughter of the Rothem family? Why is he tangled up with another woman already?‚Äù

I said nothing, merely watching as the woman‚Äôs fingers tightened around the cup she held. I could see it in her expression‚Äîthe boiling anger, the disgust.

And then, just as I anticipated, she snapped.

With a sharp flick of her wrist, she tossed the contents of her coffee onto Ethan‚Äôs face.

The caf√© went dead silent.

Ethan shot up from his seat, his expensive suit now stained with coffee. Gasps and whispers spread across the caf√©, but the woman didn‚Äôt wait for anyone‚Äôs reaction. She turned and stormed out, her long hair swaying behind her.

I smirked.

Xander blinked, then let out a low whistle. ""Wow."" He looked back at me and shook his head. ""I have to say, your stepbrother is worse than I thought. I never imagined he‚Äôd push someone to that point.""

He paused, then glanced toward the exit where the woman had disappeared. ""And that girl‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs got guts. Poor thing, though. Getting involved with someone like Ethan? She really got unlucky.""

I suddenly remembered the way she had punched the wall with anger that night with everything she got.

I chuckled, shaking my head. ""She‚Äôs not as pitiful as you think.""

Xander shot me a curious look. ""Oh?""

After a brief moment, he leaned back, sighing. ""Anyway, Ethan‚Äôs officially getting engaged soon, huh? With the backing of the Rothem family, he‚Äôll probably become the official heir to Buckman Corporation. I have to admit, that‚Äôs quite an advantage for him.""

His tone turned grim. ""Cole, you‚Äôve worked so hard for years. Are you really just going to sit back and watch everything you built get handed to him on a silver platter?""

I didn‚Äôt respond.

Xander scoffed. ""Come on. Don‚Äôt act like it doesn‚Äôt bother you.""

When I still didn‚Äôt say anything, he frowned. ""Look, I know you don‚Äôt talk about it, but what your father did to you was complete insane. Instead of supporting his own son, he backed some stepson with no blood relation. He forced you out, made things difficult, and did everything he could to block your path.""

I listened in silence, unaffected by his words.

Xander shook his head. ""And yet, here you are, back in New York, acting like none of that matters. Are you seriously not going to do anything?""

I finally set my cup down and met his gaze. ""I stopped longing for my father‚Äôs approval a long time ago, Xander.""

His expression shifted slightly, but he let me continue.

""My mother‚Äôs fate was enough to show me how foolish it is to beg for something that will never come,"" I said calmly. ""I have no interest in fighting for his love or recognition.""

Xander exhaled, rubbing his temples. ""Then what are you planning?""

A slow smile tugged at my lips.

""They tried to bury me,"" I said. ""But in doing so, they forced me to grow into something they can no longer control. My father might think he can hand everything to Ethan, but the other shareholders? They‚Äôre not blind. They know the value I bring.""

Xander studied me for a moment before a smirk formed on his face. ""So, you‚Äôre going to take everything back.""

I didn‚Äôt answer directly, but the confidence in my eyes said enough.

My years overseas had shaped me into someone stronger, someone untouchable. Unlike Ethan, I didn‚Äôt need the Buckman name to define me. But that company? It held my mother‚Äôs blood, sweat, and tears. I wouldn‚Äôt let it fall into the hands of a man like Ethan.

As I turned my gaze back to him, I noticed the caf√© manager bowing respectfully in front of him, listening as Ethan barked commands. Even after all these years, he still carried himself like some spoiled rich boy, demanding respect instead of earning it.

It was really annoying.

But it wouldn‚Äôt last forever.

Xander stretched his arms and sighed. ""Alright, enough talk about business. Since you‚Äôre finally back, let‚Äôs go out tonight. I‚Äôll call a few others‚Äîwe‚Äôll celebrate properly.""

I glanced at my phone and shook my head. ""Can‚Äôt. I have a family dinner.""

Xander moaned. ""Seriously? After everything, you‚Äôre still showing up to those fake, awkward Buckman family gatherings?""

I smirked, slipping my phone into my pocket. ""Of course. Wouldn‚Äôt want to miss out on the entertainment.""",1,1744852274.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1k10otn,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1k10otn/i_cant_get_over_my_traumatic_break_up/,I can‚Äôt get over my traumatic break up,"In advance I‚Äôm sorry for the length of this post.

I‚Äôve been struggling with getting over my first break up.

Me and my gf (now ex) were only together for around 5 months. But the impact will stay with me forever.

We began as FWB since she was recently coming off a bad relationship where the guy said he wanted a relationship but ended up only using her for sexual. She wanted to keep things simple between us and not catch feelings to avoid any complications like her last relationships (she had other bad experiences before). As mentioned in the heading, this is my first experience with anything, no fwb no gf no situation ship. This is my first rodeo lol. And I didn‚Äôt want to overstep so I just didn‚Äôt say a word about the feelings that I had already caught before she even proposed the transition from F‚Äôs to FWB. Eventually she said she had feelings and I was relieved and we finally got together. I know there‚Äôs probably a million people who say they were in love but weren‚Äôt actually but I was, she was very adamant that she was too often times saying that it wouldn‚Äôt be possible that I could love her more than she does me.  The issue here was that our relationship from fwb to ‚Äúdating‚Äù wasn‚Äôt really all that different. Sure we had open feelings now but all we did was sexual stuff, this was due to her religion and not being able to be seen so every meet had to be in my bedroom, which tends to be a sexual environment; mix that with the fact we rarely saw each other and we are horny teenagers. She had always expressed that she wanted me to initiate more so I slowly learned to go against what I was used to and become the person who started.

We did some more normal couples things as we got more comfortable and threw the being seen to the wind a bit more, between coffee and lunch dates. And ofc my personally favourite gift giving. Everything seemed to be going as good as it could in our situation. 

One day she said she wanted to come over and I decided we would be watching The Chamber Of Secrets because she stopped after movie one and I can‚Äôt think of marriage with someone who hadn‚Äôt completely all 8 movies. 

That day when she came over she was on her period and we both just wanted to watch the movie, or atleast I wanted to make sure she paid attention and watched the movie. I put it on and like anyone who makes a loved one watch a classic I‚Äôm watching the screen then flicking back to her to see her reactions. She seems a little off and not enjoying it so I ask if she‚Äôs having a good time, she leans over and says yes in her sensual voice before kissing me and climbing on top of me on the couch. I‚Äôm now straddling (can‚Äôt see the movie) and well looking in her closed eyes while she continues to make out with me. I‚Äôm obviously enjoying this but I can kiss her anytime no ones looking, watching the chamber of secrets isn‚Äôt something we can do in a split second in public. So I avoid her kissing and say let‚Äôs watch the movie. She is visibly upset and hurt by me doing this, I believe she took this personally and thought I didn‚Äôt have interest in her. I apologized and she seemed still hurt. After a bit of watching the movie in silence I tried to initiate to make her feel better leaning in for a kiss, she responded so I advanced more hand on her thigh, she put her hand elsewhere üçÜ in retaliation. I asked if she wanted to escalate to more, she didn‚Äôt respond to this with a yes or no, instead saying ‚Äúoh yah?‚Äù And kissing me harder. And as we progressed I was convinced she wanted to go more so I teased her and asked again. This time she smirked and got down. After a bit we decided we didn‚Äôt have time to finish so we watched the movie for the rest of the time we had.  We had a little cute moment when she got scared of a spider and had me kill it then she proceeded to touch my face a bunch and giggled while I squirmed and pleaded. 

The cute moments is what I left that day remembering.

Two days later she messaged me having a panic attack. I have delt with panic attacks before and know hers as well, I try my best to make her feel comforted over text but nothing is working. I ask to call and she says no, normally she‚Äôd jump at the thought of calling but she not only didn‚Äôt want to, she didn‚Äôt want to because she didn‚Äôt want to see me, not taht she couldn‚Äôt. I was concerned and confused but I still tried my best to comfort her but knowing this I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be the one who could most effectively calm her down. She then said that our meet up the days prior is what had her feeling this way. I didn‚Äôt think anything was up with that day so I asked what specifically it was. 

She did not feel safe with me that day, saying my asking multiple times was the only reason she did what she did and she genuinely didn‚Äôt want to do it. In her state she wasn‚Äôt filtering any thoughts and started going off on me calling me a rapist and a creep that needs to keep it on his pants. Saying she wanted to break up and cut it off. At this point I was in shock. My biggest fear has always been getting accused of hurting a girl, especially one I loved. I left my phone and sat on the floor trying to gather myself. I knew I asked a few times but I didn‚Äôt see it as me trying to convince her I thought she wanted to because what she was doing and I couldn‚Äôt comprehend it being viewed that way but I couldn‚Äôt deny it cause I knew my girl needed help but I couldn‚Äôt help her. I hear my phone ding several times in a row and it‚Äôs from our mutual friend saying those same things to me, this was someone who respected me as a friend and leader. Suddenly gone forever. I thought I had always made it clear she could say no to me but apparently I didn‚Äôt, I have always had a fear of a situation like this happening so when she expressed her wanting me to engage and shared her CNC fantasies to me I went as far as having her record consent tapes before anything of the sort. But on this day she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable and I‚Äôm forever in regret I couldn‚Äôt make her feel that way.

Me and my gf eventually got on call later and talked it out as we were both in shock. When she came back down from her state she said she redacted her prior statements but still didn‚Äôt like the way I made her feel that day. I apologized as many times as possible but the damage was done and a month later she broke up with me. 

Now I‚Äôm struggling with the break up losing the love of my life, losing one of my best friends (the mutual), and knowing that I was capable of hurting someone I loved without even realizing it. And the cherry on top of my end is that when we kept contact after break up for a week or two she got with a dude she had called cute before we became a couple and that I had asked her to stop talking to while we were together and she told me not to worry about it.

I know that I‚Äôm a piece of shit for asking her too much, I wrongly assumed she felt she could say no to me and completely miss read her signals, it should‚Äôve been enough knowing she was on her period. 

Now we are able to be on good terms but her emotions towards me are completely gone as she lost them all after that incident, I unfortunately am still VERY in love dispite the situation and I feel like every-time I hear about her and this guy I‚Äôm being cheated on but there‚Äôs no fault but my own for fumbling my dream girl.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm deserving of help but if anyone has any tips for getting over a breakup or just a traumatic situation like this I would greatly appreciate it. Over the last couple weeks I‚Äôve been in a bad depression as I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to since I lost my only two communication sources with the break up. I can‚Äôt afford therapy and I‚Äôm currently settling for Dr. GPT as it stands üò≠. I‚Äôve tried moving on and finding either a new girl or even just a friend but I‚Äôve lost all social confidence and I‚Äôm scared as hell to involve myself with another person while she seems to be just fine. Thank you Reddit, I‚Äôm sorry for the length of this post.",0,1744852157.0,therapy,1,0.5,False
1k10nug,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPSC/comments/1k10nug/insomnia_solution/,Insomnia solution,"I have been experiencing insomnia for the past 1.5 months. No matter what time I sleep, I always wake up after 4.5 hours and then can't go back to sleep. I sometimes have trouble in sleeping at night as well. This has been happening everyday for the past 1-1.5 months. I know the reason for this most of the times is just stress but I just can't feel it. The only thing I'm probably stressed about is not getting enough sleep.
This issue has effected my productivity a lot. I feel sleepy all day and can't focus much. With the exam coming up, I'm really worried about this.
I drink one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and that's it. I eat dinner 3-4 hours before sleeping. I have tried to do everything in my power to solve this. I don't want to go to the doctor as he will just give me sleep aids.

Has anyone else faced this issue and found out a solution?

1k10llo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1k10llo/had_coffee_after_8_years_nc/,Had coffee after 8 years NC,"Had coffee with an ex who did breakup with me years ago. That ex and I share a friend, and I bumped into her one day when I visited him. She suggested coffee and I obliged.

A bit of context: 8 ish years ago I used to be a wreck who failed at life and school, I felt so fucking worthless after the breakup. That despair fueled me to move to another city and change my life around. I worked my ass off for years and completed a 2nd degree and finally got into medicine. I am now considered successful and have my shit together. I am in a much better place.

So that coffee date was meant to be platonic. It caught me off guard how much I still liked her. She was gorgeous and the mixed feelings of familiarity, nostalgia and some form of love? was just amazing.

The next day, I hesitated to tell her how i felt. Considering we are both single, what's the worse that could happen right? It's not like I would still not be over her after all these years. Wrong. That caught me off guard too.

She says she cares too much about me to start something again and fears too much how it would go. It felt like she wasn't telling me everything but It honestly sounded like typical friendzone bullshit.

I know it's not reasonable to be hurt or to be upset, but i am. It brought me back to those same feelings of absolute worthlessness and despair that i haven't felt in almost a decade. I feel so fucking pathetic to be hurt.",6,1744851880.0,ExNoContact,9,0.88,False

I'm a young executive, and have never experienced something like this, so I really need support. 

I've definitely developed some romantic chemistry between a colleague and I at the office. He's our broker/property manager for our headquarters, and I'm temped to ask him out for coffee or lunch, on a casual, as friends basis and see how he reacts. 

I just fear for my reputation and public perception because I'm somewhat high profile, and while he's not quite at my level in visibility, he's well known and respected at a well known, high-end Real Estate firm. I don't want observers to get the idea that there's some sort of conflict of intrest, unfair advantage (this is a high-ticket transaction/relationship), or think we're both unserious. He's also obviously significantly older (10 years+). 

Any advice? ",0,1744851663.0,ceo,1,0.5,False
