So I started a sports network for professionals in Manchester back in October.

It’s got 100+ members from 70+ companies and it’s growing quickly.

You can grow your network, socialise and enjoy sports all in one.

We play squash and badminton weekly.
We set up tennis and padel but really you can do whichever sports you want to - just ask in the group and you’ll get a match up.

Hiking is being planned for 2025 along with table tennis and a group padel session.

We go for coffee after, chat and make new friends.

It’s a no alcohol before and after policy. The chat is a good vibe but respectful. We are professionals after all…

Fit. Fun. Fast Networking.

Drop me a message and I’ll share the WhatsApp chat link.",1,1734430151.0,manchester,0,1.0,False

I have just starting attempting to peat, although I’m no expert. I’ve just started having more orange juice and coffee with sugar. I have also been cooking everything in coconut oil, but am yet to have the carrot salad. 

For years I’ve been fasting, doing extended water fasts for 7 days a time, maybe once or twice per year. Then for years I’ve been intermittent fasting whereby I won’t eat anything until 2pm. 2 meals per day, one at 2 and then one at around 7-8. I feel as though this has impaired my metabolism and thyroid. 

I am going to the gym daily now to lose weight. I do weights one day (push pull legs) , and then the next I do a power walk for 45 minutes. For me I just feel like every day is important, as I feel as though I will just fall off the handle when I have a day off. 

I’m consistently waking up before my alarm, I have no issue going to sleep, my issue is that I wake up early. My diets massively improved to what it used to be, however there are still seed oils everywhere and I am slowly getting rid.

I’m in the Uk, I’m getting hardly any sunlight with work. I have been vaping heavily too which I know is bad for me, and seems to irritate my stomach as I get heavy bloating off of them. I am stopping them as of today, to find out if they are the issue. I’m also reducing the coffee intake as of today and replacing it with matcha instead. Just to see if I’m drinking too much. 

My gut feeling is it’s excessive cortisol, but just wanted to find out if anyone could advise.

My average diet:

No breakfast until 2pm, but have recently started drinking coffee. So about 3 large cups of coffee, with milk and two sugars.

Lunch
1 sandwich (sourdough)/ wrap with filling such as cream cheese and chicken / tuna mayo / coronation chicken filler (has seed oils)
5 dates
Banana

Dinner normally looks like this:

Steak mushrooms and tomatoes
Eggs + avocado on sourdough bread with butter 


Glass of raw milk with honey/vanilla extract/ 
Small shot glass of pomegranate juice

I have noticed my appetite has decreased as well particularly after the gym. Not sure if that’s related.

Thanks for the help. I know I have a lot of work to do I am just getting to grips and reading as much as I can. As I say I am very much a beginner.",1,1734430010.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

1hg7h36,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1hg7h36/how_to_find_the_hope_to_improve_in_times_of/,How to find the hope to improve in times of darkness.,"I'm going through a really shitty time. I've got a ton of problems: an absent father, no friends, a body I'm not proud of at all, decent grades but not good enough for the exams I have to take, an ex-best friend going around telling people I'm a player, and no money in my pocket.

I know this sounds like a crazy wall of text, but obviously, you need to understand my problems to know how to help me. Let's start with the first one:
My father isn’t one of those stereotypical dads who goes out for milk and never comes back… every now and then, he gives my mom some money, but that’s about it. Every time I’ve tried to talk to him about my problems, the conversation always shifts to money, with him saying he can’t afford to give me anything or help me financially.

Let me make it clear: I turned 18 this year, which, in my country, is the first year of “adult” life. Most of the problems I try to discuss with him have nothing to do with money. In general, it feels like he’s moved on and built himself a new life. He’s got a new partner now and seems to care more about her kids than about me. Last year, he gave them Christmas presents, while for me, it’s already a big deal if he gives me 50 bucks for my birthday or Christmas.

Let me clarify that by ""problems,"" I mean general questions or things I wanted to talk to him about—not these specific issues, which I’m addressing for the first time now.

The second problem: I don’t have any friends. And I mean none. When I get home, aside from studying, working out, and so on, I just watch TV series and play video games. That’s it. I don’t even go out on Saturday nights, to give you an idea.

I’m an open person—I’m not an introvert who never talks—but in general, if the other person isn’t willing to make an effort to be friends, it’s hard for me. My classmates, who I’ve tried to connect with over the years, have bonded with each other, but not with me. I’ve tried to befriend them by buying them coffee, supporting them when they were struggling, offering understanding… but nothing seems to work. At this point, I’ve accepted that it’s never going to happen with them, but it still hurts that I can’t make friends.

Outside of school, the people I’ve managed to connect with aren’t people I spend much time with. Often, they either don’t go out, are busy, or go out but don’t tell me. To be clear, when I ask them to hang out, they usually say yes, but they almost never ask me first.

The third problem: I’ve been going to the gym for almost two and a half years. In the past, I had a decent physique—not anything too muscular, I’ve never had a six-pack—but you could tell I worked out. Today, though, I almost feel like I’m overweight. I stopped going to the gym over the summer, and it was a mistake I still haven’t forgiven myself for, and it did a lot of damage. Now, I don’t have muscles anymore; my strength is about the same, but in my case, hypertrophy seems more like “minitrophy” haha.

I almost feel discouraged to go back because, on one hand, I see myself as fat and want to change, but on the other hand, I’m honestly scared. I’m stuck on this. I’d love to have an amazing physique, ideally before I turn 30 haha.

I dont have a belly.. but Im not exactly lean.
I’m afraid of failing and becoming even more overweight.

About my ex-best friend: We've known each other for four years. When he was at rock bottom, ugly and super skinny, the loser of all losers, I was there for him and always tried to help him improve, sharing what I knew and comforting him. Now, it feels like a nightmare. He’s going around telling people that I’m a player, he doesn’t respect me, and acts like he’s better than me. I really want to beat him up, but what stops me is the fact that if I did, I’d come off as the bad guy to others, and I could risk getting suspended from school.

About the school problem: I have a passing average, but it’s not great overall. Im bad in math and in physics. The rest is just passing grades. How can I improve my grades without stressing myself out? I don’t like spending too much time on books, but I’m willing to study in a more balanced way.

Regarding money, I've tried everything. Now that I’ve just turned 18, I can finally work, but I have to be careful about choosing the right job since I don’t have a car and need to stay focused on school, as this is the year I need to get my diploma.

I’ve tried using social media and selling via email, but nothing worked. This summer, I threw almost secret parties because I didn’t have permission, and I made some money, but it wasn’t much. Do you have any advice? I want to find a way to study and have money in my pocket, so I can at least afford the basics without having to ask anyone for money—and without thinking about my dad.

Please help me out.

1hg7h0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1hg7h0e/slowly_faded_away_and_then_broke_up_right_before/,Slowly faded away and then broke up right before our anniversary. I am on a carrousel of emotions. ,"My fiancée broke up with me a week ago, just two days before our anniversary. We were in a long-distance relationship (LDR) until next year while she worked part-time at a fine-dining restaurant and attended medical school.

We’ve known each other for nine years but reconnected 18 months ago. At the time, she was in a failing relationship and told me they weren’t on the same page about the future. A few months later, she left him, and our relationship took off like a rocket. The chemistry, desire, and connection were unlike anything I had experienced before. For the first time, I saw someone who shared my dreams of building a life focused on business, travel, and partnership, not just marriage and kids.

Despite always telling myself I’d never propose, I did. I told her it wasn’t about a wedding or family but a promise of love—that I wouldn’t abandon her, and we’d face our fears together. She cried and said yes. We agreed to keep it our secret, but hours later, she told her cousin and then her mom. Her mom asked if she was sure, and she said she was 100%.

For two months, everything felt perfect, but then she started to pull away. She became colder and more distant, and we stopped having sex. The last time we had sex it felt disconnected. We were having sex but no interaction. She wanted spooning, and she just stayed there with her eyes closed grabbing the mattress. Like she was thinking of someone else fu**ing her. 

About two weeks before our last sex he even started mentioning a work colleague—a head chef-, though I tried not to overthink it. She kept telling me about what plates he is cooking and what new foods she tried. I sensed some admiration. 

Soon, she stopped letting me visit, said I was “needy” for wanting to come early for Christmas, and then ended things. She said she needed to focus on her career, wanted to be alone, and doubted relationships could last forever. She blamed the LDR but refused to let me visit when I offered.

What hurt most was her denial—she dismissed all the good times, denied the proposal, and even claimed she made up the conversation with her mom to make me feel good. After the breakup, she texted me, thanking me for understanding and saying her mom and grandmother love me, adding that we’d see each other at Christmas.

Lately, she’d been visiting different restaurants, meeting chefs, and even having them follow her on Instagram, which triggered me. My gut tells me her head chef colleague is more than just a friend, but I can’t be sure. Who else would present her to other chefs?

After my proposal she started going to therapy but then stopped discussing it. She became aware of her DA issues. During the breakup, she said she still goes but wouldn’t share details because it’s “personal.” Strangely, she mentioned “X” saying it’s okay not to want a relationship—X is also the name of the chef. I don’t know if she slipped or if it’s a coincidence and the therapist shares the same name. 

I have a good relationship with her mom, who asked me to meet for coffee yesterday, unaware of the breakup. She confirmed that the proposal story and their conversation were real, saying my ex’s denial is likely a coping mechanism. Her mom was shocked too, saying her daughter had never been so happy and fulfilled. She encouraged me to give her time, believing things might align again in the future.

Hearing this gave me a brief sense of relief, but I can’t shake the feeling of betrayal. I suspect she emotionally cheated and dumped me for someone else, especially with her sudden desire to stay in the city instead of moving back home. I keep obsessing over it, even though it no longer matters.

I know she ruined everything. Even if she comes back, nothing will be the same. Too much pain and distrust. But I least want to know the truth. If she wants to be alone, I can accept that. If she want to live her life a few more years, I can accept that. But betrayal by telling me she doesn't want any relationship anymore just to hook up with another guy, I can't accept it. And when I say accept, I mean be in good terms in the far future. Not accepting means never wanting to see her face or know of her existence ever in my life.

1hg7dkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1hg7dkq/thank_you_grok/,Thank you Grok ❤️ ,"I asked Grok for some insight. Here was my prompt:

I broke it off with a 12 year toxic relationship in which I was the victim of a trauma bond from a covert narcissistic. I almost escaped the relationship by getting engaged to a girl who I felt like would be my life boat. But she died. And then I wound up back with the narcissist. I cut it off no contact five months ago. Along with simultaneously quitting an alcohol, weed and cocaine addiction. And also an eating disorder. I gained 200 pounds in 5 years.  Can you shed some insight on why I feel how I do, and coping mechanisms to get through this? I've been isolating a lot lately. 

And here was Grok's response:

Navigating the aftermath of such a complex series of events—ending a long-term trauma bond, losing a significant other, battling multiple addictions, and dealing with an eating disorder—can feel overwhelming. Here’s some insight into why you might be feeling the way you do, along with coping mechanisms to help you through this challenging period:

Why You Might Feel How You Do:
Grief and Loss: Losing someone who felt like a ""lifeboat"" after years of trauma bonding can intensify feelings of grief. This loss, combined with the end of the toxic relationship, might leave you feeling adrift or without direction.
Withdrawal and Recovery: Quitting multiple substances and dealing with an eating disorder means you're experiencing various forms of withdrawal, both physical and psychological. This can lead to mood swings, depression, anxiety, and a sense of loss of identity.
Trauma Bond Breakage: Ending a trauma bond with a narcissist is akin to breaking an addiction. The feelings of emptiness, loneliness, or even longing for the abuser are part of the healing process as your brain adjusts to life without the intermittent reinforcement of the relationship.
Body Image and Health: Gaining weight after an eating disorder can lead to complex feelings about body image and self-worth. It might also come with health concerns or societal judgments, adding to your stress.
Isolation: Withdrawal from social interactions can be a protective mechanism after such intense personal trauma, but it can also exacerbate feelings of loneliness and depression, creating a cycle that's hard to break.

Coping Mechanisms:
Immediate Coping Strategies:
Acknowledge Your Feelings: Understand that feeling a wide range of emotions is part of the healing process. Journaling can help you process these emotions without judgment.
Structured Daily Routine: Establish a routine to give your day structure, which can help manage anxiety and depression. Include time for meals, physical activity, and rest.
Grief Counseling: Consider therapy specifically tailored to grief. Losing someone significant while in a vulnerable state can be particularly hard to navigate alone.

Recovery from Addictions:
Support Groups: Engage with support groups for each addiction you've battled. NA (Narcotics Anonymous), AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), and groups for eating disorders can provide community and understanding.
Professional Help: Continue or seek therapy with someone who specializes in addiction and trauma. They can offer personalized strategies for managing cravings and emotional triggers.

Dealing with the Trauma Bond:
No Contact: Maintaining no contact is crucial. If you haven't already, block and remove all ways your ex might reach you or see your digital footprint.
Reframing: Work on reframing your past relationship. Therapy can help you see the patterns of abuse more clearly, reducing the idealized memories that might pull you back.

Body Image and Health:
Gentle Exercise: Start with gentle, enjoyable forms of exercise to reconnect with your body in a positive way. Yoga, walking, or swimming are great options.
Nutritional Guidance: Consult with a dietitian or nutritionist who understands recovery from eating disorders to help manage your diet in a healthy, balanced way.
Body Positivity: Engage with body-positive content or communities that promote health at every size to help shift your perspective on body image.

Combating Isolation:
Social Reconnection: Slowly reintroduce social activities. Start small, maybe meeting one friend for coffee or joining a group activity where the focus isn't solely on conversation.
Volunteer or Classes: Engaging in community service or taking up a new class (cooking, art, etc.) can provide a sense of purpose and connection.
Online Support: If in-person feels too overwhelming, online forums or support groups can be a less intimidating way to interact.

Long-term Healing:
Self-Compassion: Practice self-compassion. Healing from such a broad spectrum of traumas and habits takes time; be patient with yourself.
Life Goals: Begin setting small, achievable goals for your life post-recovery. This can give you a sense of direction and purpose.
Mindfulness and Meditation: These practices can help you stay present, manage anxiety, and gradually rebuild your sense of self.

You've already taken monumental steps by ending the toxic relationship and addressing your addictions. Remember, recovery is not linear, and setbacks might occur, but with persistence and support, healing is possible. If you feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals for guidance.

I got my coffee and I went to my table. I was walking with two girls towards my table and we were walking in the same direction. Im 5'8 and they were 5'6. 

The two girls went and sat in a table in front of me and there was a third girl with them. Let's call the third girl X. 

The third girl was white, she had very curly black hair and a very chubby face. She was wearing a heavy coat and she otherwise looked fat because her face was quite chubby and her cheeks were quite big as well. She even had some fat under her chin so I assumed she was somewhat obese. 

The first two girls were shorter than me and all of them had the same sitting heights. In fact one of the first girls was obese and her face was quite identical in fat distribution to the third girl X.

Here's where matters took a twist. From a lifetime of getting mogged I can exactly tell a person's height by just looking at them. The third girl X stood up to take her coat away. Her physique was hidden all this while. She stood up to be 5'11 and she mogged a lot of average sized girls nearby. 

On top of that even though her face appeared fat and chubby, she had a perfect physique with really big boobs and yet she had a perfectly flat stomach. Her body was thin throughout. Even though she facially looked fat and had big boobs, she still had nearly zero fat on the rest of her body. There was absolutely no way her body could exist. It's like all her fat was redistributed to her boobs and face. As a girl she brutally mogged her own friends.

What i thought was an obese girl turned out to not only heightmog me but even have an ideal female body that would mog other females.

To confirm I was heightmogged I walked behind them as they left and I confirmed that she was indeed three inches taller than me lmao. I guess she like the female version of the chad",3,1734428449.0,shortguys,1,1.0,False

By: Mary and Matthew P
	It was a normal day at work for Carl, he was doing what he normally does which is fixing paper jams, getting coffee for coworkers, unclogging toilets, delivering mail to coworkers, clearing wasps out of ventilation, dealing with homeless squatters in the warehouse, fixing electronical security systems and computers. Joe Oldman, Carl's boss, comes in and hands Carl a bat then tells him to take down the wasp nest that's clogging the ventilation system in the warehouse. Carl heads out right away, not wanting to disappoint his boss, and gets to work. He goes to the warehouse and grabs a latter, but as he's unscrewing the outdoor ventilation, Ned the homeless squatter who lives inside the ventilation of the warehouse saw Carl messing with his house. He grabs a hipbone out of his cart and hobbles his way over to Carl, then starts poking him in the back. Carl unaware of what's going on turns around and says, ""May I help you?"" Ned just muttered and continued hitting Carl with the hipbone. ""Stop it!"" Carl said. But Ned got to work on him. Old Man McCardry walked by and saw what was conspiring. He quickly walked over and pulled Ned off of Carl. ""Now get on, now get."" Exclaimed McCardry. Ned hobbled back to his cart, put away his hipbone and crawled back into the ventilation. Carl thanks Old Man McCardry and grabs his tools. Old Man McCardry starts ridiculing him for his lack of masculinity and inability to fight off an old crippled homeless man. ""A real man would've been able to fight back, but a scrawny weaseljerby like you wouldn't last a day."" After hours of hassling with Ned, Carl finally gets rid of the wasp nest. When Carl got back in, Joe Oldman called him up to his office. When Carl got to his office Joe Oldman told him to step in and close the door. ""After careful consideration we have decided to promote you to paid intern, but obviously that's just a title you will not actually receive any pay."" Said Joe Oldman. Carl feeling a dash of dread said, ""Thank you boss, it's everything I’ve ever wanted."" As Carl started to make his way out, Joe Oldman yelled, ""Oh, and one more thing! Your being let off for the rest of the year. Y'know, coronavirus concerns."" Carl was making his way through the lobby of Dunder Mifflin when Michael P, a fellow coworker, called out, ""Hey loser! I want a coffee. Go get me one."" Carl responded, ""Actually, I don't work here anymore. I got laid off."" Michael proceeded to come up to Carl and slapped him in the back of the head, then said, ""I said get me a coffee you loser."" Carl enraged tried to stand up for himself, but Carl was just a scrawny weaseljerby. Michael easily pushed him over and still demanded for his coffee. Carl replied in a sarcastic voice, ""Sure I'll get you a coffee, meet me at Starbucks, 11 o'clock sharp."" Carl got up and walked out and as he was walking home, a scheme came into motion. Carl went to the local black market weapons dealer that he knew through his seventh cousin twice removed. ""Hello, I'd liked to buy the most untraceable weapon you have."" The dealer said, ""I'll get you one out da back. You'll be ballin' in no time homie. Until then welcome to my lit crib."" So, the dealer went to the back looking for an untraceable weapon. He came back and laid a muzzle loading rifle out infront of Carl and said, ""Sorry my homie all I got is dis old 1602 muzzle loading rifle."" To which Carl replied rubbing his hands together, ""Perfect."" Carl slapped down a stack of cash and ran off with the rifle. He set up on top of a building overlooking the Starbucks. Carl looked down at his watch. ""Michael should be here any minute."" He looked down the scope that he mounted on his rifle and scanned for his prey. Finally, at 11:07, Michael unknowingly walked directly into Carl's sights. Carl said snappily, ""Here's your black coffee expresso loser."" Carl took aim and discharged his weapon. But, the moment he pulled the trigger the rifle exploded causing him to stumble backwards. He fell off the roof and into a dumpster below. At the same moment the round fired from the rifle completely missed Michael, and went through the windshield of a truck, causing the driver to swerve and crash into the Starbucks. While Carl was laying in the dumpster unconscious, a dump truck came along and lifted Carl with all the trash dumping him inside. Carl woke in the pitch black, smelling only dirty diapers and rotten eggs. It didn't take Carl long to figure out he was buried under a mountain of trash. Carl dug for his life, it took him 17 hours to eventually emerge victorious from the heap of garbage. Carl got his bearings and continued home. While he was walking along the street it started to rain and a car drove by splashing him with muddy dirty water. Carl fell down to his knees and looked up to the sky screaming in emotional agony. ""WHY ME!?"" As he sat there depressed, a group of kindergarteners came up with plastic knives and nerf guns telling him to walk down the alley. Carl refused and said, ""A bunch of kindergarteners can't tell me what to do."" And so, one of the kindergarteners came up and pointed his Dora the Explorer nerf gun at Carl and said, ""Move it you loser."" Carl stood up and his raised his fist to punch the child. But the kids ganged up on him and beat him down to the ground. Then Carl saw a woman walk by. He screamed out, ""Please help me!"" The woman walked over and told the children to come to her. ""Children you should be ashamed of yourselves, not taking his money after you've brutally beaten him. Go on now take it from this weasel of a man. He deserves to feel your foot."" So the biggest kindergarten came up and curb stomped him, then stole his wallet. After they left, Carl crawled out of the alley way and approached an old woman for help. Carl grabbed her ankle and pleaded for help. ""Get yo' hands off me you whippersnapper!"" She then started beating Carl with her handbag. Carl ran for his life terrified of what the old senile woman would do to him. He hid in an alley but then the group of hornets he had taken down earlier attacked him. So, he ran for an open door that led into a warehouse. Carl looked behind and saw a bunch of guys sitting around a table. He approached them and asked them what they were doing. All of them looked at him surprised. Then all of a sudden he heard a loud crashing sound and the room filled with armed men screaming, ""Police, on the ground!"" Carl was tackled to the ground by a SWAT officer and then handcuffed and thrown into the back of a transfer van with the thugs from the warehouse. As they were driving, one of the others leaned over to him, ""So, what you in for?"" Carl replied, ""I didn't do anything. I'm innocent."" The fellow passenger replied, ""That's what they all say."" The fellow passenger then leaned in even closer, ""My name is Fariz Ahkbar. I want to offer you a job."" Carl having just lost his job was appealed by the offer, and said, ""I'm listening."" Fariz leaned in closer this time. ""You look like the weasely kind, how'd you like to get back at everyone who's ever harmed you? All you have to do is deliver a simple package."" Carl thought for a second. ""This seems kind of suspicious. What package?"" Fariz answered, ""The less you know the better."" After several hours of waiting in a holding cell, Carl's dad, Butch Hy, came to pick him up. ""Get in the car son, how come it is I gotta be pickin you up from county jail? Why can't you be more like your little brother, Kevin. He's smarter, stronger, and quite frankly, has a real job and doesn't get into as much trouble."" Carl attempting to defend himself said, ""Dad I didn't do anything. I just walked in on them."" His dad snarled. ""Sure. I want you out of the basement by the end of the night."" When Carl got home, his mom had already taken his things upstairs and was throwing it out of the window. ""Mom, what're you doing!?"" Exclaimed Carl. His mom shouted down, ""I don't want my children being criminals! I'm doing what I should've done twenty years ago when your turned eighteen!"" As Carl ran around trying to catch his stuff from crashing into the ground, Fariz came up to his house. ""How bout' that job, weasel?"" Carl looked over. ""How'd you find me?"" ""I have my ways,"" answered Fariz. Carl as he watched his Xbox One come crumbling to the ground, looked over and said, ""I'm in."" Fariz took Carl to his house and brought him in on the plan. ""Here's our target."" Fariz raised up a picture of a man with his wife and kids. Carl immediately recognized the child. ""Hey that's one of the kids that mugged me in the alley way!"" Fariz looked over at him. ""Are you serious? You got mugged by a freakin kindergartener?"" Carl answered, ""Look they had knives and guns ok?"" Two months had passed, they had already put together a foolproof plan to off FBI agent Parker, the father of one of the children that had mugged Carl. Carl's job was to deliver the ""package"" (a shaped explosive inside a hiking bag). As he walked in sweating bullets he took the ""package"" over to the FBI anti-terrorism seminar which agent Parker was attending. As he walked over to deliver the ""package"" Michael P recognized him and came over slapping him on the back of the head. ""Still waiting for my coffee loser."" One of the agents outside the conference noticed the confrontation and walked over to intervene. As he approached the two, he noticed wires sticking out of Carl's bag. The agent drew his service weapon, called it in, and then directed Carl to lay on the ground. After only minutes there was dozens of FBI agents surrounding Carl directing him to walk backwards to the sound of their voice. They put Carl in handcuffs and dragged him down to the FBI station. Agent Gibbs walked into the interrogation room and slapped a file in front of Carl. ""Why'd you do it kid? Why'd you try to plant the bomb?"" Carl replied with a cynical look, ""My entire life I've been small. This was my one chance to be big. To prove how big I can be."" The agent walked out into a large office area. ""Give me an update on our suspect Agent Bart."" ""Yes sir,"" replied Bart. ""Our suspect was being investigated for associating with known drug traffickers about two months ago. He was cleared but on his way to the County Jail after being arrested, he rode with Fariz Ahkbar, where we believe he was radicalized and joined the cause willingly. There's no proof that Ahkbar was involved, and honestly I believe it was probably just the kid trying to prove himself."" ""So, we got ourselves a lone bomber,"" said Agent Gibbs. Carl spent the rest of his miserable life in Guantanamo Bay, a federal super max prison for terrorists. 

Happily Ever After

Carl the Unpaid Intern: Escape from Guantanamo Bay
By: Mary and Matthew P

Carl attended to his daily prison duties which consisted of scraping the gum and bird poop of walls and tables inside and outside the prison complex. As he scraped the crap off a table in the courtyard, a group known as The Flat-liners (The Scalpel, The Syringe, and The Defibrillator) approached him.  Carl stands up having finally finished scraping and is Immediately handed a note. 

“Why is it wet!?” Carl exclaims.

Note: “We’re holding a medical exposé in the shower room tonight and you’re our honorary cadaver.”

Carl’s eyes widened. The Flat-Liners were the stuff of prison nightmares—three psychopaths known for their “medical” methods of dispatching their victims. Carl slammed the letter down and muttered, “Nope. Nope. Not happening. I’m getting out of here tonight.”

Carl glanced around looking for anyone who might aid him in his escape or at least serve as a distraction. That’s when he laid eyes on “Simple Chad” known as the prison idiot, Simple Chad was dropped on hid head as a child then again when entering adulthood. 

Carl: “Chad! My buddy, my pal. We’ve always been close right?”

Chad: “Uhh no we haven’t?”

Carl: “What are you talking about? We’ve always been buddies. Hey I have a job for you, meet me at the bathroom so we can play a game.”

Chad: “A game oh boy!”

Chad skips off and Carl returns to his cell. That night, under the dim orange glow of the prison lights, Carl and Chad crept out of their cells, heading for the communal bathroom. Chad whispered excitedly, “This is the best game ever, Carl.”

Carl: “Yeah, yeah, just keep quiet.”

As they slinked through the shadows, a metallic clunk echoed down the hall. From a nearby vent, a pair of greasy hands emerged, followed by the twisted face of Creepy Cooter, the prison’s resident black-market dealer. His milky eye darted around before he slithered out fully, holding up a grimy Gatorade bottle filled with a suspicious yellow liquid.

“Psst, boys,” Cooter hissed. “You lookin’ for somethin’ special? Got me a bottle of ’Cooter Juice.’ It’ll give ya wings. Real wings.”

Carl wrinkled his nose. “Uhh no thanks Cooter”

Before Carl could finish speaking, the hallway flooded with light as guards burst in. “FREEZE!” one barked, pulling out his radio. “We have a code Cooter! I repeat, code Cooter! That infant-eating freak is in the ventilation again!”

Cooter let out a hiss like a feral cat, clutching the Gatorade bottle as he scurried back into the vent. The guards gave chase, leaving Carl and Chad alone in the chaos.

Carl grabbed Chad’s arm. “Perfect timing. Let’s go!”

They burst into the communal bathroom, heading straight for the maintenance grate leading to the sewage tunnels below. Carl ripped it open and gestured to Chad. “Down here, now!”

Chad hesitated, holding his nose. “It stinks!”

“It’s part of the game! Just get in!”

Reluctantly, Chad followed Carl into the pitch-black tunnels, both of them waist-deep in human waste.

Carl gagged and for a few minutes, all they could hear was the soft sloshing of sewage water and the distant echo of alarms. Then, from somewhere behind them, a blood-curdling shriek pierced the air.

Carl froze. “What the was that?”

Chad’s face went pale. “I don’t like that sound, Carl.”

Emerging from the darkness, they saw her—the Rat Queen, a large rat that had been living in the tunnels for years, surrounded by swarms of rats. It’s eyes glowed unnaturally as it dove under the crap. 

Carl screamed. “RUN! RUN!”

He and Chad began wading as fast as humanly possible,
at last, Carl spotted a faint light up ahead. “The exit! Come on!”

Carl scrambled up onto a rusted ladder and pushed open the grate leading outside. Fresh air hit his face as he emerged onto the muddy shoreline. He gasped, collapsing in exhaustion. “We made it…”

But as Chad climbed out, Carl looked back just in time to see the Rat Queen’s claws close around Chad’s ankle, pulling him back into the darkness.

“BUUDDGGEEE!” Chad screamed, his voice echoing as it faded away.

Carl could only stare in horror as silence returned to the tunnel.

Tears in his eyes, Carl stumbled along the shoreline, gathering trash and debris to build a makeshift raft. Using driftwood, old tires, and duct tape he found washed up on shore, he cobbled together a floatable monstrosity.

Pushing the raft into the water, Carl collapsed onto it and drifted into the night.

As he floated away, he muttered, “I’ll make it, Chad. I’ll make it out of here for the both of us.”

The raft creaked ominously, but Carl didn’t care. He was free—covered in sewage, alone, and traumatized—but free. As a wild storm set upon Carl he looked into the massive waves and screamed “FOR CHAD!” ",1,1734428229.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

# ""You're gonna love it, Max,"" Dad said, patting him on the back as they stepped out of the car. Max looked up at the quaint, two-story house with its freshly painted white fence, trying to force a smile. The town they'd left behind was a blur of honking cars and streetlights. Here, it was all rolling hills and chirping birds. The quiet was unsettling.

# Mom unlocked the door, and the smell of dust and old wood greeted them. The house was a fixer-upper, filled with forgotten furniture and a lifetime of memories from the previous owners. Max's sister, Lily, and his brother, Jake, dashed inside, eager to explore their new home. Max trailed behind, feeling the weight of his backpack filled with unpacked school supplies.

# The first week of school passed quickly. Max made a few awkward attempts to fit in, but the stark contrast between the fast-paced city life and the laid-back country vibe was harder to navigate than he'd thought. His siblings, on the other hand, seemed to take to the new environment like ducks to water. On the way home from school, they'd often stop at the local store for snacks, sharing laughs and stories with the friendly owner, Mr. Jenkins. Max felt like the odd one out, his mind still racing from the chaos of the city, unable to slow down to match the tranquil pace of the country.

# On the next Monday, Max walked to the school with Jake and Lily, the chilly fall air hinting at the impending change of season. The school was a red-brick building with ivy creeping up the sides, surrounded by a patchwork of green fields. The kids they passed all waved and smiled, but Max couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The day went well enough, teachers were friendly, and the classes were interesting enough to keep him engaged. It was only at the end of the day that things took a dark turn.

# As they left the school, a group of teenagers who looked like thugs stepped out from the shadows, blocking their path. Max's heart raced as he saw the malicious glint in their eyes. Jake and Lily looked at him nervously, knowing what was about to happen. The biggest of the bullies, a boy named Billy, sneered at Max. ""Thought you'd get away with it, huh? You're not in the city now, you're in our playground,"" he taunted.

# The group began to circle them, and Max felt his fists clench. He'd seen this play out too many times in his old school, but he'd promised himself he wouldn't let it happen here, not to his siblings. He stepped in front of Jake and Lily, trying to shield them. ""Back off,"" he said, his voice firm despite the fear that quivered in his stomach. Billy's laugh was like a punch to the gut. ""Look at the hero,"" he jeered. The others joined in, closing in tighter.

# The first blow came out of nowhere, catching Max on the side of the head and sending him sprawling to the ground. He tasted blood and felt the world spin, but the pain was strangely distant.

# Jake and Lily screamed as the bullies turned their attention to them. Billy grabbed Jake's backpack and threw it into the bushes. ""You're next, pipsqueak,"" he said, advancing on Jake with a smirk. Max's vision cleared just enough for him to see Lily standing in front of Jake, fists balled up, ready to fight. The rage inside him grew, but his body felt like it was made of lead. He tried to get up, but another kick sent him reeling.

# The bystanders had all stopped to watch the spectacle. Some looked on with pity, others with a hint of fear. A few had the audacity to laugh, egging Billy and his friends on. But no one stepped forward to help. Max felt a burning in his chest, not just from the pain, but from the betrayal of his new schoolmates.

# The bullies were relentless. Each one took their turn, punching and kicking him while the others held back his struggling siblings. Lily's tears fell freely, and Jake's eyes were wide with terror, but Max's vision was blurred by the rage building up inside him. He felt the cold, hard ground against his cheek and tasted the metallic tang of his own blood.

# But then, as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The group of thugs retreated, their laughter echoing down the path as they vanished into the schoolyard. Max lay there for a moment, the world spinning around him, before pushing himself up onto his hands and knees. His ribs protested with every movement, and his nose felt like it might be broken, but the fury coursing through his veins gave him strength. He spat out a mouthful of blood and dirt.

# With a grimace, Max helped Jake to his feet, the younger boy's eyes still wide with shock. Lily was next, her trembling hand finding purchase in Max's outstretched arm. They didn't say a word as they retrieved Jake's backpack from the bushes and began the long walk home. Each step sent jolts of pain through Max's bruised body, but he gritted his teeth and kept going, not wanting to show weakness in front of his siblings.

# The house was quiet when they arrived. Their parents were still at work, and the sun was dipping low in the sky, casting long shadows across the lawn. Max led the way inside, his mind racing with what he could tell them. He didn't want to worry them, but the silence of their shared secret felt like a heavy burden. They cleaned themselves up as best as they could, Max wincing as he wiped the dried blood from his nose and Lily dabbed at the bruises forming on her cheeks. Jake was mostly unscathed, but the fear in his eyes was palpable.

# At dinner, Max's heart felt like it was in a vice. Each question from his parents about their day felt like a lie waiting to be uncovered. ""How was school?"" Dad asked, his eyes scanning over them. Max took a deep breath. ""Good,"" he said, forcing a smile. ""I just had a little accident playing soccer after class.""

# Mom looked at him with concern. ""Are you okay, sweetie?"" she asked, reaching out to feel his forehead. Max nodded, avoiding eye contact. ""Just a little dizzy, but I'll be fine,"" he lied, hoping his voice didn't betray his pain. Lily and Jake exchanged a quick, nervous glance. They'd agreed to keep the truth hidden, not wanting to upset their parents with tales of bullying so soon after their move.

# That night, Max retreated to his new room, his body aching and his spirit bruised. He stared at the old cupboard in the corner, one of the few pieces of furniture they hadn't replaced. It was tall and oak-colored, with intricate carvings that told stories of a different time. He decided to distract himself by arranging it, hoping the task would take his mind off the events of the day.

# As he moved aside the hanging shirts, his fingers brushed against a cold metal edge. Curiosity piqued, Max investigated and found a hidden compartment, cleverly disguised by a false panel. It was small, barely large enough to fit his hand. His heart racing, he tried to pull it open, but it was stuck fast. He pushed and prodded, feeling around the edges until he heard a faint click. The compartment swung open, revealing an unexpected treasure.

# Nestled within the dusty cavity was a small, gleaming amulet. It was round and made of what looked like silver, with a strange emblem in the center: a snarling wolf with emerald eyes. Max picked it up, feeling its weight and the coolness of the metal against his skin. The emblem was surprisingly warm to the touch, almost as if it was alive. He couldn't explain the sudden sense of power that washed over him, or the tingling in his fingertips. It was as if the amulet had chosen him, whispering a promise of protection and strength.

# Ignoring the pain from his bruises, Max carefully looped the amulet around his neck, feeling it rest heavily against his chest. It was surprisingly comfortable, as if it had been made just for him. He took a deep breath and stood up, the room seeming to brighten around him. His reflection in the mirror was the same, but somehow, he felt different. There was a newfound confidence in his posture, a spark in his eyes that hadn't been there before.

# The next morning, Max woke up feeling refreshed, as if the beating had never occurred. He touched his face gently, expecting the tender swelling and bruises to greet him, but there was nothing. No pain, no marks, just smooth, unblemished skin. He stared at his reflection, astonished. The amulet's power had healed him completely. His siblings stirred in their beds, and he knew he had to keep his newfound strength a secret. They didn't need to know how close they'd come to disaster.

# He walked to the kitchen, the aroma of sizzling bacon and brewing coffee filling the air. His mother was at the stove, flipping pancakes with a practiced ease. She looked up when she heard his footsteps, surprised to see him up so early. ""Max,"" she said, her eyes lighting up with a warm smile. ""You're usually a sleepyhead. Did you have a good sleep?""

# Max returned her smile, his thoughts racing with the events of the night before and the mysterious amulet. ""Yeah, Mom,"" he lied, trying to keep his voice casual. ""I just woke up early."" The bruises and aches from the bullying had vanished as if they'd never existed, leaving him feeling both baffled and relieved. He sat down at the worn wooden table, watching as she plated the food. The amulet felt like a comforting weight around his neck, a silent sentinel against any future harm.

# They ate breakfast in relative silence, the usual morning banter replaced by the quiet contemplation of the day ahead. Max helped clear the dishes and pack lunches.

# ""You guys ready?"" Dad called from the doorway. Max looked over at Jake and Lily, who nodded solemnly. They were all aware of the potential danger that lay outside their home.

# As they set off for school, the amulet felt heavier than ever against Max's chest. The sun had barely risen over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dewy fields. The quiet was shattered by the distant sound of laughter, and Max's stomach clenched.

# The school gates came into view, and his heart began to race. There they were, the same thuggish faces, lounging against the brick wall like predators waiting for their prey. Max felt his fists clench, and he quickened his pace, his siblings' small hands in his tight grip. He didn't know what was going to happen, but he knew he had to be ready.

# As they approached, Billy and his gang looked up, their smirks turning into wide grins at the sight of the bruised and battered trio. Max could feel the power of the amulet pulsing through him, a warm, fiery sensation that seemed to be urging him to fight. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart, and made a silent wish: let me be as strong and skilled as a martial artist.

# They stepped through the gates, and Billy took a menacing step forward. ""Look what the cat dragged in,"" he jeered, his friends laughing in the background. Max could feel the heat rising in his cheeks, his fists clenching. Without another word, he took a stand, pushing Jake and Lily behind him.

# The leader of the thugs, a towering figure with a neck as thick as a tree trunk, approached Max, his grin widening as he sized him up. He grabbed Max by the shirt, yanking him closer. The amulet's warmth grew, pulsating with a strange energy that seemed to resonate within Max's chest.

# ""Please,"" Max managed to croak out, his voice laced with fear and a hint of the power he hadn't fully grasped. ""Let us go."" The words hung in the air, a desperate plea that seemed to echo through the silent schoolyard.

# The thugs laughed even harder, their eyes shining with malicious pleasure. ""Or what?"" Billy sneered, his grip tightening. ""You gonna cry too?""

# The sound of their cruel laughter bounced off the red brick walls of the school, drawing the attention of other students who had begun to gather. The sea of faces that looked on were a mix of pity, fear, and curiosity. Lily's eyes brimmed with tears, and Jake's bottom lip quivered as he fought to hold them back. Max felt his cheeks flush with embarrassment and anger, his fists clenching harder around the strap of his backpack.

# One of the new thugs, a boy with a shaved head and a sneer, took a step forward and reached for Max's bag. Max's instincts took over. The amulet around his neck grew hot, and the energy that had been simmering within him suddenly boiled over. He sidestepped with a grace that surprised even him, evading the grasping hand with ease. The boy stumbled, his expression a mix of shock and annoyance.

# Max took a deep breath, focusing the power that was surging through him. His right leg shot out, his foot connecting with the side of the thug's head in a kick that was as swift and precise as a hawk's talons. The boy's eyes rolled back, and he flew through the air, his body landing with a thud on a pile of discarded school supplies. The onlookers gasped as he lay there, unmoving. The laughter had died away, replaced by a tense silence.

# The remaining thugs stared in shock, their smirks wiped clean from their faces. They took a collective step back, their earlier bravado forgotten. Max felt his muscles flex and tighten, his movements fluid and powerful as he faced the next assailant. His fists connected with a series of swift jabs and kicks, each one more punishing than the last. They didn't stand a chance. One by one, they were sent sprawling across the yard, their bodies crashing into benches and walls with a sickening thud.

# The crowd of students had grown, their whispers rising to a hushed awe. Some looked on in horror, others in admiration. Max's heart raced, the power of the amulet coursing through him like electricity. He felt untouchable, a force to be reckoned with. The bullies lay scattered around him, groaning and clutching at their bruised faces. Only Billy remained standing, his grip still tight on Max's shirt.

# With a snarl, Billy swung a massive fist at Max's head, but Max saw it coming as if in slow motion. He ducked and weaved, the energy from the amulet guiding his movements. He threw a punch that connected with Billy's gut, the air leaving the larger boy's lungs in a whoosh. Billy doubled over, and Max took advantage of the moment, delivering a swift kick to his jaw. Billy staggered back, the shock and pain written all over his face.

# Max felt a strange thrill, a power he'd never known before surging through his veins. He reached out, grabbing Billy by the collar of his shirt, and with a strength that seemed to come from somewhere other than his own muscles, he lifted the bully off the ground. Billy's eyes went wide with fear, his legs kicking at the air as he dangled helplessly in Max's grasp. Max's hand tightened, and for a moment, he considered throwing Billy as far as he could.

# But then, Lilly's small hand tugged at his arm, her eyes filled with a silent plea. Max looked down at her, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The sound of Billy's pained grunts filled his ears, but Lilly's gentle touch was like a cool breeze through the storm of his anger. He felt the rage in him recede, the power of the amulet ebbing slightly. He realized that he didn't need to be the monster that Billy was. He could be better than that. With a grimace, Max set Billy down gently. The bully crumpled to the ground, coughing and wheezing, a wet stain spreading over the crotch of his pants.

# The crowd of students had gone silent, their eyes wide with shock. The smell of urine hung in the air, a stark reminder of Billy's fear. Max felt a twinge of pity, but it was quickly doused by the memory of his siblings' bruised faces. He stepped back, allowing Billy to push himself to his feet. The bully's eyes darted around, looking for escape, for backup. But his friends were either unconscious or too stunned to move.

# With trembling hands, Billy wiped at his mouth and nose, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked down at his wet pants, and a look of humiliation washed over his face, turning his cheeks a deep shade of red. Max couldn't help but feel a twinge of satisfaction at the sight. He'd never felt so powerful, so in control. The amulet's energy was still coursing through him, begging for more. But Lily's hand was still in his, her eyes filled with a gentle concern.

# As the last thug stumbled away, the crowd of students erupted into applause. They surged forward, some cheering, others whispering in amazement. Hands reached out to shake Max's, patting his back in congratulations. He was bombarded with questions and praise, the same kids who'd laughed at him just yesterday now looked at him with newfound respect. It was a heady feeling, one that he never knew he'd crave. Max looked down at his fists, still clenched, and felt the power of the amulet pulsing in his chest, urging him to bask in the glory.

# But he didn't. He didn't want to be the school's new hero. He didn't want to be known as the kid who beat up the bullies. All he wanted was to protect his siblings and live a peaceful life in this quiet town. He gently extracted himself from the throng, his heart racing, the adrenaline from the fight still pumping through his veins. He turned to Jake and Lily, their eyes wide with a mix of shock and admiration. ""We need to get to class,"" he said, his voice still shaking slightly.

# Their walk through the school corridors was a blur, whispers and stares following them like a shadow. Max felt the weight of the amulet, now a beacon of his hidden strength. The hallways that had once seemed so long and daunting now felt like a prison, each step echoing the reality of what had just occurred. The siblings reached their lockers, the metal doors a stark contrast to the warmth of their previous home. Max's thoughts swirled as he fumbled with his combination, the numbers feeling foreign under his trembling fingers.

# Unknown to the trio, a pair of sharp eyes had been watching the confrontation from a distant window. Principal Pricilla, a figure of stoic authority, had observed the entire incident with a peculiar amusement. Her office was on the second floor, a vantage point that allowed her to keep a hawk's eye on the schoolyard. She was known far and wide for her stern rule and the whispers of darker talents that swirled around her like a malevolent mist. Her eyes had narrowed at the sight of the power that surged through Max's body, and she recognized the row nature of it. The power that had surged through the new kid was not natural, not in the least.

# The thugs, once her unwitting pawns, had been dealt with swiftly and decisively. They were sprawled on the ground, nursing bruises and a newfound respect for Max. Pricilla knew their fear was temporary, a byproduct of shock and pain. But the power she'd seen, that was something else entirely. It was a beacon in the otherwise mundane tapestry of the school's social hierarchy.

# Her mind raced as she strode back to her office, the heavy oak door creaking open to reveal a room filled with the faint scent of incense. The walls were lined with ancient tomes and artifacts from her family's storied past. Pricilla was a descendant of a long line of witches and wizards, each one more powerful than the last. The thugs had been her eyes and ears, keeping the lesser students in line, but now there was a new player in the game.

# Principal Pricilla had sensed the power surging through Max from the moment he'd stepped into the schoolyard. It was raw and untamed, a wild force that could not be contained for long. She knew she had to find out where it came from, and what it meant for her school. As she settled into her chair, the leather groaning in protest, she stared out the window, her eyes narrowing.

# The amulet, she thought. It had to be the amulet. The stories spoke of a time when such objects had been commonplace, but those days were long past. The artifact had likely lain dormant in the house for decades, waiting for someone to awaken its slumbering might. Max had been the unfortunate soul to stumble upon it. Or perhaps, he'd been chosen. her eyes fell on a dusty, leather-bound book titled ""The Arcane Amulet."" A slow smile spread across her lips as she realized the implications.

https://reddit.com/link/1hg72hz/video/7p2y1llmnd7e1/player

Hi everyone!  
After using several different laptop brands, I must say that Lenovo's Legion series has one of the best thermal designs. For most cases, simply elevating the base, keeping the laptop clean, regularly repasting thermal paste, and using it in a clean environment will keep it cool. If you want further optimization, debloating Windows, undervolting CPU/GPU, and adding a cooling stand is more than sufficient.

However, watercooling is not exactly “budget-friendly” or “newbie-friendly,” and modding a Legion laptop for watercooling isn’t really necessary. I did it mainly for the joy of DIY, so if you enjoy modding as much as I do, this is for you.

# Concept and Design

Inspired by the XMG Neo 16’s watercooling setup, I created a *plug-in watercooling mod*. It’s completely detachable, portable for work or a coffee shop, doesn’t require soldering or invasive modifications, and can easily revert to stock configuration. Plus, it’s reusable for other laptops with minor adjustments if you upgrade or switch devices.

I purchased an extra bottom cover, cut holes, and applied pressure on a waterblock (similar to RAM cooling blocks) against the vapor chamber of my Legion Pro 7. I used *putty* for the thermal interface. An AIO system with a **30W pump, 240mm radiator, dual 3000 RPM fans**, and a water tank circulates coolant through the waterblock via **quick-disconnect fittings** for easy installation and removal.

https://preview.redd.it/kvlkdajxnd7e1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77a4bf79a9d6d4dee40a9f15959185fed5c2e51e

**Hardware used:**

* **Custom CNC coldplate**: Standard RAM blocks have a 4mm thick coldplate, but the Legion Pro 7 only has a 2mm gap, which can put unwanted pressure on the vapor chamber. I had a custom **2.5mm coldplate** designed. Alternatively, you can use the EK Monarch RAM block (2.7mm thickness) for an easier, budget-friendly solution. I can also share CNC-ready acrylic designs if needed.

**Note:** While direct cooling to CPU/GPU would be more effective, this mod only cools the vapor chamber (acting like the IHS), so stock fans remain operational, and portability is preserved.

# Installation and Reverting to Stock

All components are mounted on the custom bottom cover. To revert to stock:

1. Remove the modded cover.
2. Wipe off the putty (reusable).
3. Attach the original cover.

Reinstalling the watercooling is just as easy: reapply the putty and mount the modded cover. And voilà — your Legion Pro 7 becomes what I call the *Legion Pro 10*! 😄

# Cooling Performance in Games

With this mod, I recorded **GPU temperatures dropping by 20-24°C** and **CPU by 23-29°C**, depending on the game. All tests were performed in **custom mode, tuned software, and 4K+ resolution (3840x2400)** to push the laptop near its design limit (\~230-240W CPU+GPU combined). Actual temperatures will be even lower during regular use.

Stress tests also showed reduced temperatures for RAM and SSD, proving that cooling the CPU/GPU vapor chamber indirectly benefits other components.

about the party that isn't taking place

and to be woken-up with suitcases

They were here in Texas visiting their son who is a friend of mine. I went to his house to meet them. His mother made us tea that she had brought with her from Liverpool. It blew my mind! Up until that moment I had never liked black tea; now I'm in love with a black tea and obsessed with finding it again. I could give up coffee for this tea, and I'm someone who roasts my own beans and has a year's supply stockpiled in case supply chains ever break. THAT's how much I love coffee.. 

The tea poured a bright, deep, crimson red that, once it was in the mug, looked as solidly black as coffee. She added milk to it. There was nothing thin or delicate about this tea. It was velvety sweet without added sugar and packed a heckuva punch. It had tremendous body. It wasn't just malty, it was **MALTY!**  

I asked her what kind of tea it was. She said it was a breakfast tea. When I told her that I've had English and Irish breakfast teas but they tasted nowhere near as strong and malty as hers, she just smiled and said, ""It's a *Northern* breakfast tea.""

After they went back to England my friend gave me a baggie full of teabags she had left behind. I've been reading this forum ever since trying to figure out what brand they are. The teabags are rectangular in shape (not squares) without strings or tags. They look like pictures I've seen of Taylor's of Harrowgate teabags, but those seem to come in pairs, while these are individual.

Assam teas are said to be malty. I went to an Indian grocery store and bought some Tea India CTC Assam teabags and loose tea in the red and gold foil bag. It's nice and malty but not as malty, complex or red as what she served me.  

What's a kickass, super-malty, ruby red ""Northern breakfast tea"" that Liverpudlians buy? What's north of Liverpool? Scottish Breakfast? Yorkshire Red? All I know is: not Irish, not English breakfast tea.",4,1734427776.0,tea,1,1.0,False
1hg710t,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1hg710t/signs_you_might_be_polyamorous_33m_31f/,"Signs You Might Be Polyamorous 🏳[33M, 31F]","It's a borrowed list:

You know that feeling when you have a bunch of favorites, like celebrities, food, movies, styles, and you think, “Why choose just one? They’re all amazing.” Well, some people feel that way about relationships too. Polyamory isn’t about playing the field or dodging commitment. It’s about realizing love doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game.

If you’ve ever felt like monogamy doesn’t quite fit, or you’ve got more room in your heart than a studio apartment, here are 10 signs you might be polyamorous.


1. You’ve Loved More Than One Person at the Same Time

You’re not a player; you just genuinely have a lot of love to give. What can you say? You’re basically an emotional buffet.


2. The Idea of “One True Love” Feels Limiting

You hear “soulmate” and think, “Why stop at one? My heart’s got room for the sequel, prequel, and a couple of spin-offs.”


3. Monogamy Feels Constraining

When someone says, “You can only love one person,” you’re like, “Aw, that’s cute. Tell me another fairy tale.”


4. You’re Curious About Ethical Non-Monogamy

You’ve googled terms like “polycule,” “metamour,” and “kitchen table polyamory,” and somehow, it all just clicks. Congrats, you’re fluent in poly-lingo.


5. Exclusivity Doesn’t Equal Commitment for You

You’re not about hoarding love like it’s a limited edition collectible. For you, commitment is about being present, not putting a “reserved” sign on someone’s heart.


6. You Value Emotional and Personal Autonomy

“You’re my partner, not my only outlet for connection.” You believe love thrives when everyone has the freedom to explore, not when they’re handcuffed to exclusivity or treated like someone’s ‘only source of happiness.’


7. You’re Comfortable Navigating Complexity

Love triangles? Cute. You’re over here managing love hexagons and emotional calendars with the precision of a ISRO  launch team.


8. You’re a Boundary-Setting Pro

“So you’re seeing someone new? Cool, let’s set some ground rules that work for all of us.” You’ve got relationship blueprints that would make architects jealous, clear, respectful, and drama-free.

9. Jealousy Isn’t a Dealbreaker for You

Instead of spiraling when your partner flirts, you’re like, “Let’s talk about it. Also, maybe share their cologne brand while you’re at it.”

10. You See Relationships as Flexible, Not Rigid

“Labels are for jars, not love.” Your relationships are like clay, flexible, adaptable, and sometimes messy but always uniquely beautiful.


If you’re nodding along like, “Wait, that’s me,” congrats! You might be polyamorous or just incredibly good at organizing emotional chaos. Either way, love how you want, as long as everyone’s honest, happy, and consenting.


But Wait!! Isn’t Polyamory Just Fancy Term For Cheating? 🚫

We’ve all heard the criticism: “Polyamory is just cheating with extra steps.” But before you jump to conclusions, let’s take a quick detour. Here’s how polyamory is not cheating. Spoiler alert: it's a whole lot more honest and open than the drama-filled versions you might be imagining. Let’s break it down!

How Polyamory Is NOT Cheating 🚫

1. Honesty, Not Spy Thrillers

Cheaters be like: “I was at gym… with my phone off… for three hours.”
Poly folks: “I like you. I like them. Let’s grab coffee and talk like adults instead of sneaking around like Bond villains.”


2. Consent That’s Real, No Blackmail or Jedi Mind Tricks

True consent sounds like: “Yes, I’m comfortable with this.”
Not: “I guess if I say no, you’ll leave me, so… okay?” If someone’s guilted, pressured, or manipulated into agreeing, that’s not poly. It's just a scam with extra dialogue.


3. Everyone’s on the Guest List, Not the Bench

Cheating treats people like side characters who didn’t get a speaking role. Polyamory makes sure everyone gets a seat at the table, a voice in the conversation, and absolutely no one’s sneaking around like they’re the backup plan.


4. Communication So Open It Needs a Whiteboard

Cheaters avoid conversations like taxes. Poly people will sit you down, take out markers, and map everyone’s feelings like it’s a business strategy meeting. Feelings get aired, boundaries get set, and everyone’s (mostly) sane.


5. Trust > Drama Bombs

Cheating: “Wait, who’s that on your phone?” Boom. Relationship nuked.
Polyamory: Everyone’s in the loop. Trust isn’t just built. It’s reinforced with group hugs and maybe a shared Google Calendar.

So, whether you're poly, curious, or just here for the laughs, remember relationships are about honesty, connection, and trust, not labels, definitely not cheating, or the thrill of the forbidden. Catch you on the flip side. Keep it real, keep it open! ✌️

The tour usually lasts about 2-3 hours but we finished ours around 4 hours, napasarap kwentuhan with the guide and dumaan kami sa ibang path. Nag-start kami sa St. Mary’s church and lumabas malapit sa Sagada Weaving. I recommend our guide since super maalam sya and do not skip spots like some guides according to him, so you really get what you pay for. I can give you his phone number if i-aavail nyo ang Paytokan tour.

Tour fee is 1000 php good for 10 pax. We availed our tour sa Sega, 2-3 mins walk from Tourism Office, and few steps away from our accommodation. We stayed at Lodge Labanet for 3D2N 1100/Night 2 pax. 

Our budget was around 20k php. 

Tips:
- If you’re a plantito/plantita, pwede kayo manghingi ng halaman nila just ask them nicely, even coffee plant pwede manghingi. 
- ‘Pag nagtitipid naman kayo, makihati na lang kayo sa tour fees, pwede kayo magtanong-tanong sa mga kasabay nyo sa tourism office if gusto nyo na lang maghati-hati.
- Wear strap sandals and shorts sa Paytokan walk since tatawid kayo sa ilog.
- Our tour guide prefers Mt. Ampacao over Marlboro Hills, so go for it dahil madalas walang sea of clouds ngayong December. 
- Don’t wear crocs if pupunta kayo ng Marlboro Hills, lalo na if umulan, super dulas pababa. Ingat din kayo sa mga cow dung😅",21,1734427529.0,phtravel,4,1.0,False
1hg6xsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hg6xsi/digestive_probiotics_are_a_must_have_daily/,Digestive probiotics are a must have daily supplement.,"I’m not a scientist, or a nutritionist or even a smart guy. I’m just a dumbass from CA who recently incorporated probiotics into my stack about a month ago and feel better than ever! Feel free to correct me or educate me further, but this is my ted talk about my understanding of modern nutrition and why digestive probiotics are a must.

Digestive cancers are at an all time high and they’re being diagnosed earlier and earlier.

So many of our problems stem from cellular inflammation in our guts. If you eat the modern American grocery store diet you are being fed food that simultaneously makes you obese (from sugar and carb counts) and malnourished (from digestive inhibitors in our foods disrupting cellular absorption of nutrients via inflammation, carcinogens, disruption of microbiota, the list goes on..) at the same time. And we wonder why everyone is so low-energy and depressed these days and digestive cancer is on the rise.

Our bodies don’t get what they need and a “healthy diet” in modern capitalistic America is nearly impossible to obtain without spending a small fortune. And I understand why, these companies that feed us this shit have been tasked with feeding the world, which is near impossible to do organically so they fill the food with shit as a production convenience to lower consumer prices and raise availability and don’t care about long-term population health. It sort of sucks because despite what politicians say, this is a necessary evil. The world would starve if we ALL depended on organic farming practices. I used to take mexican coffee sometimes and modafinil from modafinia but very rarely. 

Its a luxury to eat organic- very inconvenient and expensive. Try to if you can- and either way, look into digestive probiotic as they will help optimize cellular nutrition by enhancing digestion, improving nutrient bioavailability, reducing inflammation, and supporting vitamin and SCFA production. This results in better energy production, cellular repair, and overall metabolic health.

Without a digestive probiotic, there’s a chance you’re not actually “absorbing” the nutrients of the vitamins you already take, and the food you already eat.

And again, if my understanding is very inaccurate, lmk, but I feel great since incorporating this into my routine!",1,1734427344.0,Biohackers,2,1.0,False

If you constantly swap brands or types of the same product I can understand, but I've yet to know someone who idk, never buys the same type or brand of milk twice in a row. Most people are pretty consistent with that.

So I really don't get how you just don't know this stuff, especially if it's something that you use everyday. Like just based on the fact that you are seeing it everyday you should have some idea as to what it is.",1,1734427251.0,PetPeeves,1,1.0,False

Reply:

God I love this letter, it’s beautiful. I still have so much love for every person I’ve come to love in my life and guess what that # is 5, just 5. Is that a lot? I was only physically with 3 because the first was on the other side of the country we were codependent and didn’t know what a healthy love was we were always on Skype all the time and I mean all the time I think the longest call was 300 some hours wow when that crashed it felt like the end little did I know who I was just about to meet.. the first ended on that college campus and I cried so hard at night when it blew up I was at something for Japanese class or w/e and about 200 ft away the person I thought to be my soulmate, my other half and she was working at the coffee stand my heart skipped when i saw her omg she was an angel she was so damn perfect there’s nonway I could talk to her outside of being respectfully & silently in love with her, I worked in the library and the best part of my day was going to see if she was working that day she made me so happy she made me happy I didn’t die in a train accident while backpacking just a year and a half earlier I couldn’t believe I wanted to die before getting to buy my daily monster before getting to introduced to coffee for the first time because it made me feel closer to her and I got to stand there with her making it longer and it was a blended cold drink so they took a bit of time but she was good very good at her job she had that shit down so I’d get my coffee that was the same color of both of our skins albeit she had a dash of chocolate mixed in meaning she was just tad darker but both made that way the same way I got little bits of information everytime I got to see her and my coworkers in the library knew how smitten I was but I was a shy one but they’d cheer me on but I couldn’t possibly make a move nonono I could never but what if… she was my dream girl seemed like she was just like me… it wasn’t until I was working late one day so in my feet running around the library for a long time and my boss was so very kind and understanding of what I had been through, he knew I was probably going to be burdened with pain for the rest of my life.. well funny thing about pain it made me so exhausted that my walls would fall and I’d be more open because being closed off and shy just felt like a lot of work when in that much pain, it wasn’t unusual to see me just laying on the floor in some random aisle of the library.. well one day I felt like hell it was awful until thenangel walked in omg 😱 and she wasn’t with friends 😳 and she went to the back to sit alone on the couches the most comfortable place in the library for me to lay down she was doing homework or studying I couldn’t tell cause I froze for a while at the desk till my biggest cheerleader was like go on your break now damnit it’s your time if you don’t go back there I’m about to be so mad at you lol thank you Jill you were awesome and I did…l and everything worked like so perfectly I actually met her and we talked and I already made her smile n laugh then the slickest shit I never planned for happened… I lost my phone… you know where this is going “hey can you call my phone idk where It is” a request so innocent I didn’t realize till I got home later that WTF 😳 I had her #…. How in the holy hell omg omgoodness sweet diana(the princess just some weird shit I’d say instead of cursing) and I texted her idk if it was that night or if it was the next day… from there on I thought I’d end up with my college sweetheart and we’d have the best of stories when I can get my back better so I can eventually have the American dream with her (I’ve been to rehabilitation lasting anywhere from 3-6 months 14 times) eventually idk everything wasn’t the dream I imagined that time in our lives would become taboo to speak about at all I couldn’t listen to some of my favorite music from that time because it would trigger her this was when we eventually reunited downtown out on a weekend oh btw the first go around we were both virgins and we went slowly in the relationship the first time we kissed I asked her permission to kiss her, i had never kissed a girl before… we were so damn cute before it fell apart we would just cuddle a lot then eventually we’d upgraded to naked time but not sex I think she was scared as I was I didn’t know how to sex a girl! So we just lay with eachother naked for hours it seemed she was having a tough time with repressed memories that from what I gathered were on the tragic side of things all I could do is be there for her and allow her to work through some stuff which eventually became really a lot I needed time to like recharge such a huge change from always being alone my entire life to never leaving this persons side as her swat team  member mother asked of me to make sure she was safe if id was gonna be there but don’t let that let you think I like you or accept you is the vibe I got from her and I called her swat cause she’d just come busting in the apartment full fist pounding on the door because how dare we lock this what’re you doing and one time omg it was like she could smell the nakedness and probably thought we were sexing but she was just laying on my chest and id stroke her hair or her back it calmed her down and felt soothing I could feel it like she’d let this big sigh out like she’d been holding her breath the whole time but now she was safe in my arms listening to my heart… god I love her so much still to this day eventually becomes the most painful heartbreaking situation in my life absolutely tragic but I still love her but I’m much more broken today than I was back then unfortunately not that I’d be sure she’d care to ever be in my arms again ever again even if I wasn’t broken……..
Damn me for having the heart I do and still loving them because i took the time to get to know them and what’s in their hearts
Right now I’m on a tablet so my fingers are exhausted but I’ve loved 3x more and I’ll respectfully write about them later.. M was special besides the fact she was gorgeous but she has a heart so big and it felt like I didn’t truly have a partner up till then I know that sounds unfair but it really was mostly me supporting her the one I lost my virginity to on Christmas 🎅 she was going through a lot then she literally disappeared and I messaged everyone on her Facebook trying to find her…. She wasnjust gone… it was really sad and I really felt terrible that I couldn’t help her mom find her baby girl despite my efforts… Vegas? Idk what happened to this day. So that’s what I mean when it felt like wow this person (M) isn’t abandoning me we worked together because before meeting M I reunited with the well A I don’t think I put an initial earlier my coffee girl my other half one night downtown it was like everyone vanished and my angel was back right there infrintnif me, i say this with the utmost respect but this was the biggest I had seen her she was still perfect and she’d looked so healthy i loved her all the same I figured it was some medication but she was back my baby my love … she was back so everything spost to be perfect from here on out no one could have stopped us from being all over one another just grabbing her to make out I guess so lovingly that the lady that turned her shopping cart on the aisle we couldn’t notice her but once she was right next to us midway down the aisle I couldnsee in her eyes she was reminded of her true love so much she just stopped for a few seconds and said *Big Ol Sigh* “Aww… young love…” I think we made her night a special stumbling on us….
I’m getting super tired now it’s 1 am ivenbeennnwriting for hours it feels … M love we got cut short and everything was unfair last time I ever saw you you visited me in the hospital layed with me in the hospital bed and we cried we called her mom and I knew this is a moment that could’ve been something her mom cried she had heard of me the kind boy from work who’s so good with the Alzheimer’s &dementia patients.. I was a scared new father with my angel but she didn’t want to be mine once we had a baby… everything got fucked up and I went to jail the next day where I swear the cops tried to kill me horrible internal bleeding for like 8 days i had been in a head on car crash idk how but because of my pain medication I got a dui people tragically got really hurt my life was over…fk I certainly wasn’t high but I was horribly anemic at the time having to get iron infusions at the oncology clinic before work.. those poor people just crying because they had cancer it was a sad place to be…
K I gotta break here for now.. just everything goes wrong in my life from here on out I meet another angel who stopped me from taking my life and taught me I was still worth loving even though it took a long time to believe her I couldn’t believe someone could still love a complete fuckup loser like myself now a felon… I hadn’t seen my son firnsnyear. He was so scared of me 😢😞 fucked up life man

I am starting to wonder if my anxiety is actually a ptsd from a panic attack. Does anyone else feel like that?

About two years ago I was in a quite stressful period of my life and I started ""treating"" the stress with alcohol. It all led to a ful blown panic attack that lasted for 3 days where I was absolutely sure I will die, since I didn't know anything about panic attacks. Since then, I am not the same person. 

I am very fearfull in everyday life, constantly sick, nervous all the time, have a bad health anxiety and so on. I did everything the forums/books said. I stopped drinking alcohol (am quite scared of alcohol now tbh), stopped drinking coffee for a year and so on. I tought that I ""just"" have anxiety but today I realized that it would be maybe more accurate if I started to think of it like a PTSD from the panic attack. I do think that I always was an anxious person, but I didn't even really noticed it before, only notice it now looking back, but since that panic attack, it really became almost unbearable.

# 2. Dining Room: Creating a Functional Space

The dining room is where you share meals, stories, and memories. Choosing the right furniture ensures it’s as stylish as it is functional:

* **Tables**: A small bistro table is perfect for morning coffee or evening chats.
* **Plants and Accessories**: Incorporate potted plants, outdoor cushions, and string lights to create a cozy and inviting ambiance.

Balcony spaces in cities like Dubai are often compact, so selecting furniture that is functional yet stylish ensures you maximize comfort while saving space.

# 6. Outdoor Areas: Relax and Entertain

Transform your outdoor spaces—whether a garden, terrace, or patio—into a haven for relaxation with the right furniture:

* **Seating**: Choose durable pieces like rattan sofas, metal chairs, or wooden benches. Add cushions made with weather-resistant fabrics for comfort.
* **Dining**: A compact dining set is perfect for outdoor meals. Pair it with **natural furniture** finishes for a relaxed, earthy vibe.
* **Lighting**: Use lanterns, string lights, or small solar lights to brighten up your outdoor areas beautifully.

# 7. Home Office: Functional and Inspiring

With more people working from home, a functional workspace is a must:

* **Desks**: Choose a desk that fits your space and workflow. Natural wood desks are timeless and add a calm aesthetic.
* **Chairs**: Invest in ergonomic chairs for comfort during long working hours.
* **Storage**: Incorporate shelves or cabinets to keep the space organized and clutter-free.

# Quick Tips for Buying Furniture in Dubai

1. **Measure Your Space**: Always measure your rooms and doorways to ensure the furniture fits comfortably.
2. **Focus on Versatility**: Multi-functional pieces, like sofa beds or extendable tables, are ideal for maximizing small spaces.

We were due to see my dad and step mum Christmas eve morning with my 7 month daughter. If asked if we could keep it very casual as we didn't want to do a big meal Infront of everyone as they are the type of parents who criticise how we parent. Plus my FIL passed away suddenly 2 months ago so my wife isn't really in the place to play happy families. It's going to be a tough year for her family this Christmas. So we arranged to go for a morning coffee (we live local and see them fairly regularly). Well our village church has asked if our daughter can be the baby jesus in the nativity that lunchtime. My wife realy wanted to do that. We aren't really religious, but to do a nativity services on Christmas eve seems a nice think to do. know she won't remember doing it, but we will and it will be a good thing for my wife to do o what otherwise will be a hard Christmas.

No car payments, a loving, and supportive family who are always there for me… we all had dinner together the other night. No spouses, no significant others, just us. It was the most amazing feeling in the world. It was like being brought back to being a kid again; Except with a greater knowledge of who we are now as people - all reminiscing on the memories of our past who made us who we are today.    
   
          Anyways, back to the notifications. I’m a very unmedicated ADHD sufferer. At least, I’ve always been told I “suffer” from it. It is true that I am easily distracted. I’m easily overwhelmed, but never stimulated enough. My anxiety is through the roof; Will I remember to brush my teeth in the morning? Do I need a shower? When did I shower last… 1 night ago? I’ll need to shower in the morning. It’s already 11:38?! Oh man if I’m showering, I need to be up half an hour earlier, so now I’m not getting enough sle….. ***blink***
A notification pops up. *“The White Lotus Season 3 | Official Teaser | Max”*
Ooooh White Lotus Season 3!
**Click.**
       
           
          
       
          Man. My eyelids are tired. What ti….
*12:45*?!?
Oh my goodness, I need to be up in *6 HOURS*!
Crap what is wrong with me!
Boredom? An overwhelming constant barrage of more and more drama spun up by rich people with high quality cameras, and enough editing skills to convince the public they’re happy? Why is it such a bad thing to call it for what it is? It’s Hollywood. It’s lies, it’s all lies. It’s stories made up about people who realized that life isn’t worth living if you’re not living with it. INSTEAD OF JUST LIVING IT YOURSELF.     
      
           It’s just a constant barrage of useless information, about people who I don’t really care about? Sure it’s useful to know what the 1% do, but does it have to constantly take up my day? 
I asked myself that simple question about a week ago, and searched for an answer. What I found was that you COULD schedule your notifications to go off at certain times. I went into my settings, and changed it to be 3 times a day. Once at 7AM, before I leave for work; Once at Noon, for my lunch break; and once at 5PM, for when I get off of work.
          My findings were surprising, and remarkably swift:
**A)** I woke up at 6AM without any notifications.
**B)** I wasn’t immediately bombarded with garbage the minute I awoke, and I actually felt the freedom to ask myself a question - Are you hungry?

Is it embarrassing to ask yourself that question?

It felt embarrassing to communicate with myself?
Make that make sense to me. Damn right I’m hungry! But I’m just feeling like something light. Banana, Granola, and Yogurt?
Do I have all of that?
*Checks Fridge*
Nope. I have some Bacon, and Heavy Whipping Cream for my Coffee in the morning. How have I turned into Rachel’s Father?
I’ll have to go to the store to get that for mys…
     
**BLINK**
    
7AM. Notification time. I was… disappointed? What was I feeling. Indifferent? I wasn’t even curious about what I missed, I was taking care of myself for once, and I’m not letting Mrs. Megan Fox breaking up with… MGK? Didn’t they just have a k…
Why do I care about that?
It has zero relevance to me in any way shape or form. Why do I want to read about people whose lives are so destroyed from fame, that they would use their kid as a way to tug on the heart strings of America?
That’s a human child in there. Regardless of your stance on anything, the stress Megan is under, and the pure spite, and vanity of their situation for the public’s prying, invasive eyes… it would ruin any kid’s chances of having a normal life. But what is a normal life? 
Is it a choice? A choice you make over and over to get better results? At what? Clicking on notifications faster? What good does that do me if I’m just going to click on notifications for the rest of my life?

I don’t want to pity, and grieve a child I’m never going to meet, or frankly probably care about. She might be a wreck, she might be an amazing human. Once her parents no longer have control of her, isn’t that when it’s her choice to be who she desires?
What do I desire to do?

It’s… selfish? to hear that from a different perspective. It’s always: “What do **YOU!** want to do about it? Haha yeah! I totally agree with what that random stranger, whom I only know about people someone told someone about something over and over again until it infected my poor soul. 

Why is it selfish to care about yourself? How do you care about yourself? I eat food, and drink water… there’s water in soda right?

A stereotype turned movement in America. “Be kind to *ALL* people!!” 
“Just because she’s fat, doesn’t mean she’s not beautiful!!”

Is it doing her a service? Protecting her feelings, and making her feel like her body isn’t miserable to live in?
Is it easier to lie to yourself, and pretend that it wouldn’t be FUN to be able to jump 5 feet onto a table, without any leg pain? Without back pain?
The perks of working out are far overshadowed by the vanity that is an Adonis-like figure. You see him with his shirt off, being proud of the work he has put in…..

The mind wanders when it’s given its freedom. 

Delusions of grandeur were once considered prophecy, back when people were bold enough to share it. It eventually probably did too. Prophecy is just a prediction that’s manifested into existence by a single/group of individuals, right? 
Or is it inevitable? 
The Bible has prophecies. 
Do I believe in them? Maybe… They do seem like they are becoming more and more possible as the years go on. 

 I eventually got tired of debating on how I felt about the notifications that showed up, and decided I’d just stretch instead. Why not? I want to be more limber. I spent 30 minutes pushing my body to the limit, and I felt so good afterwards. 
It’s now 2:15, and I’m getting up in 4 hours. I’ll still take care of myself in the morning.

A brief Kendu Inu background to start, Kendu is an organic community with a simple aim, build the world’s biggest memecoin, and do this by through the hard work of the community. This is summed up in the Kendu moto, “We don’t gamble, we work”

Over the last nine months, the Kendu community has built a solid foundation, with 16.1k on chain holders, great token distribution, numerous Kendu affiliated brands such as Kendu energy drinks or Kendu coffee. Above all, Kendu has built a strong engaged community, unlike anything else I have seen in crypto.

Kendu is on the Ethereum chain, and you’ll most likely be aware the market is roaring. It is widely predicted this is the start of a bull run, with the prediction that memecoins will flourish after BTC/ETH start to calm.

# Strong Metric Improvement

What is happening now which motivates this post is Kendu has hit a turning point. This marks the end of a 90% consolidation, where 79% of supply was redistributed, and the start of the next phase. You can clearly see this in the Kendu chart, which is up 2x from the bottom with Kendu at \~40M market cap. What caused this turning point is quite simple: hard work done by the community to build Kendu. This is exactly what will keep Kendu growing time and time again, and is Kendu’s path to being the biggest memecoin ever.

With this turn, Kendu is seeing good increases in important metrics: Holders is increasing much faster than before, volume has increased, community engagement on social media has likewise risen. What’s more, on average between them, the combination these metrics is continuing to increase continually.

The biggest factors of memecoin potential, for me, is holder count and engagement. The engagement increases Kendu is seeing are organic, and it’s more than just holders, there is many new holders have become active community members, and are helping to build the community. This has been encouraged by the community, a number of initiatives to foster growth including video competitions, poker competitions, and a number of real life meet ups.

# Kendu Accelerators

Kendu growth will come from the Kendu community, but there is also a number of interesting things lining up in Kendu which feel can combine to give Kendu an additional boost:

1. Kendu is bridging to SOL. This is a tunnel, functioning as an additional CEX. Kendu will stay the same, but with an additional SOL audience.

2. Kendu will soon get a free Certik Audit. Kendu became only the second community ever to qualify for this (the other recently hit a $10B MC)

3. The Kendu developer, Miazaki, doxed at the bottom. Lots of community members also did the same following the announcement, and I see this as a sign of conviction in Kendu.

4. Following his dox, Miazaki started being followed by Shib leader Shytoshi, and also the creator of Doge, Shibetoshi Nakamoto liked Kendu posts.

5. The connections Miazaki has to Shib have long been rumored, some even calling him Ryoshi. All I can say for sure is Miazaki became a moderator of the Shib sub-reddit recently, and combining that with Shytoshi links shows some some strong connections.

6. An interesting article was published a month ago in the Daily coin which claims connections between the funding sources of Kendu and Shib, possibly hinting at institutional Kendu backing: [https://dailycoin.com/is-shib-preparing-to-say-goodbye/](https://dailycoin.com/is-shib-preparing-to-say-goodbye/)

1hg6pmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hg6pmv/how_to_choose_the_perfect_sofa_for_your_living/,How to Choose the Perfect Sofa for Your Living Room Layout,"The sofa is the heart of any living room—a place where comfort meets style, and where family and friends gather. Choosing the perfect sofa for your living room layout can elevate the space, creating both functionality and visual appeal. Whether you're looking for a [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas) for small spaces, exploring trendy [round sofas](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/camille-sofa-grey-round), or updating your [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), this guide will help you make the best decision.

# 1. Assess Your Living Room Space

Before shopping for a sofa, take time to measure and understand your living room layout. Consider these factors:

* **Room Size**: For smaller spaces, a **2 seater sofa** is perfect, offering comfort without overwhelming the room. For larger rooms, you can explore sectional sofas or **round sofas** for a stylish, conversation-friendly layout.
* **Traffic Flow**: Ensure there’s enough walking space around the sofa to maintain functionality. Leave at least 2-3 feet of space for easy movement.
* **Focal Point**: Identify the central element in your living room—like a coffee table, TV, or window—and position the sofa to complement it.

# 2. Choose the Right Sofa Style for Your Layout

The right sofa style depends on both the size of your living room and the overall design aesthetic. Here are some popular options:

* **2 Seater Sofa**: Ideal for apartments or cozy living rooms, a 2 seater sofa offers a compact yet comfortable seating option. Pair it with armchairs or ottomans to add flexibility to your layout.
* **Round Sofas**: Perfect for spacious living rooms, round sofas encourage conversation and create a unique focal point. They work well in open-plan layouts or around circular coffee tables.
* **Sectional Sofas**: Great for larger rooms, sectionals provide ample seating and can be arranged to fit corners or divide open spaces.

If you’re updating your **house furniture**, choose a sofa that matches your lifestyle and space needs.

# 3. Focus on Comfort and Durability

While aesthetics are essential, comfort and durability are just as important. Here’s what to consider:

* **Cushion Fill**: Choose high-density foam for a firm, supportive feel or down-filled cushions for a plush, luxurious experience.
* **Fabric**: For busy households, go for durable, stain-resistant fabrics like microfiber or performance blends. Leather is a stylish, easy-to-clean option that ages beautifully.
* **Frame Material**: A sturdy hardwood frame ensures longevity and durability, making it ideal for **house furniture** that’s built to last.

# 4. Match the Sofa to Your Living Room Aesthetic

The sofa sets the tone for your living room design. Whether you love a modern, traditional, or eclectic look, here’s how to match your sofa:

* **Modern Minimalist**: Opt for a sleek **2 seater sofa** with clean lines, neutral tones, and a slim profile.
* **Classic Elegance**: Choose tufted or rolled-arm sofas with rich fabrics like velvet for a timeless feel.
* **Contemporary Chic**: **Round sofas** in soft curves and neutral hues can add sophistication while maintaining a modern aesthetic.
* **Boho Vibes**: Pair a relaxed sofa style with textured throws, patterned cushions, and natural elements for a cozy bohemian look.

For those searching for **home furniture Dubai**, consider local stores that offer a variety of styles to suit both modern and traditional interiors.

# 5. Select the Perfect Color and Fabric

The color and fabric of your sofa play a significant role in tying the room together:

* **Light Colors**: Soft shades like beige, gray, or cream create a spacious, airy feel, making them ideal for small living rooms.
* **Dark Colors**: Bold shades like navy blue, black, or deep green add drama and are perfect for larger spaces or homes with kids and pets.
* **Neutral Fabrics**: Timeless and versatile, neutral sofas pair well with colorful accents like rugs, cushions, and wall art.

# 6. Consider Functionality for Your Lifestyle

A sofa should reflect how you use your living room:

* **For Small Families**: A **2 seater sofa** offers the perfect balance of size and comfort. Add poufs or ottomans for extra seating.
* **For Entertaining**: Larger sofas, such as sectionals or **round sofas**, provide ample seating for guests.
* **For Relaxing**: Look for sofas with deep seats, recliner options, or modular styles that allow you to stretch out comfortably.

When looking for [home furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-dining-chairs), focus on stores that offer stylish, durable, and functional options.

1hg6pkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1hg6pkl/dog_parents/,Dog Parents ,"I’ve noticed that there are two types of dog parents.  Dog parents such as myself view their relationships with their pets as partnerships.  We’re fully aware of the profound ways that our pets enrich our lives and we’re dedicated to making sure they’re living by their best lives.  It’s a partnership based on respect. 

Other dog parents treat their pets as accessories.  Sometimes that can look as innocent as tiny dog being carted around in the purse of a well to do woman walking down whatever street, Manhattan.  Other times, it’s a lonely boy chained up in the farthest corner of the yard feverishly digging a hole in the dirt for hours.  Only signs of consideration, a few dirty metal bowls. Like my dad’s dog. 

There’s this song that brings me pure elation every time I hear it lately. The chorus is just soo fitting. 

“And now I’ll never be a perfect little dog at your feet…It took a while” 

Yeah it took a while alright but now I see that I was an accessory.  Just one of the props.  The house, the spouse, the dog, the cat, the kids, the cars. The god damn hot tub. 

You expected my unconditional love and loyalty while offering the bear minimum.  
Relentlessly beating me about the head with a rolled up newspaper over an anticipated shit on the rug that never appeared. 

Funny that you immediately went and got a tiny little dogs to fill the void within days of me moving out.  

What’s not funny is how you treat the dog. That day we met for coffee and a talk.  You barely interacted with the poor thing.  No concern for her comfort or safety.  Her struggling to keep up behind us as we walked. I thought to suggest we slow our pace or just pick the poor thing up but I bit my tongue. 

Those subtle digs tonight? I see what that was.  I knew once I tried to sever the ties clean you’d start rolling up the newspaper.  How dare I not be loyal to you?  Well it worked. Clever girl.  You had me so busy licking my wounds that I couldn’t focus on anything or anyone else.  Just what you wanted. 

Well you may have ruined my fucking night but I’m not gonna crawl under the porch and die over it.  And despite the ever alarming disregard you have for my well being, I have nothing but love and empathy for you.  And I sincerely hope it works out well with your new person.  

That’s what love looks like. 

PS 
I really miss MY cat. She chose ME as her human for a reason.

And as I had been low contact with her for almost four months at that point, I didn't think it would bother me too much. Cool, nice, my mom disowning me. Solves my guilt issues for choosing myself over her happiness. 

No, actually I miss my mom. I miss my mom so dang much, I'm crying in bed. 

I miss the mom I knew when I was a kid, before I knew that what she was was a bad person. Before I knew that the things she did were not healthy. I was four, five, whatever. All I knew back then was how much I loved her and that no matter how wide I spread my arms, it wasn't an accurate measurement for what that amount was. I can't drink coffee, but I learnt how to make it the way she liked it, so that I could make her a thermos of it and drive it out to her workplace and surprise her, listen to her gripes about the day so far, and give her hugs. She sent me that text, and days later I still found myself browsing a website and looking at a lovely coat and thinking to myself ""oh, that's the color my mother loves. I should purchase it for her as a surprise.""

An older lady at an office party held my hand and dragged me to the food table because I was content in being a wallflower. She told me that she was a mom, while laughing, and saying she wouldn't let me be excluded. I almost cried the whole way home, and had to scold and reprimand myself ahead of time to avoid trying to latch onto her as a motherly figure when that's not anything I know I should be doing.

1hg6n9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hg6n9d/i_feel_alone_but_everyone_tells_me_im_not/,I Feel Alone but Everyone Tells Me I'm Not,"My name is Harvey Walsh, a name I cling to these days as proof that I remain unchanged... human. Everyone around me seems different now, despite their constant insistence that it's all in my head. Something changed one day, yet somehow didn't. You might think I'm going crazy from all the pills I was taking, but I stopped those a while ago. They didn't help my problem—they only made it worse.

It started small: tiny inconsistencies in the world around me, like watching a familiar movie where the dialogue was slightly off. My neighbor Tom would water his lawn at exactly 7:43 every morning, his movements following the same arc, down to the precise bend of his wrist. The barista at my local coffee shop began drawing identical patterns in every latte—perfect spirals that never varied. These were little things, easy to dismiss... until they weren't.

Watching my neighbors and coworkers is like observing people rehearsing how to be themselves. Their gestures and speech carry a touch too much deliberation, like actors perfecting roles they don't quite understand. The wrongness of it makes my skin crawl, but who can I tell when everyone around me has become a perfect replica of themselves?

Then came the dreams—no, nightmares. Even that word fails to capture their weight. They began last month, and now, whenever I close my eyes for more than a minute, my body betrays me. It's as if someone flips a switch, and I'm out. Even when I fight to stay awake, my consciousness slips away the moment my eyelids drop. I jerk awake, drenched in sweat, the sheets twisted around me like restraints.

Tonight was no different. I forced myself to stay awake, but it didn't matter. When I opened my eyes, I found myself back on that train, the 8:43 to downtown. The familiar unease crept in as I looked around at my fellow passengers—some reading news, others absorbed in their phones, a few waiting listlessly for their stops.

Until it started.

A sound erupted—a scream, visceral and raw, echoing through the train's walls. It was agonizing and distorted, like nails scraping across a blackboard but emanating from human mouths. The passengers collapsed in unison, their screams matching the first. Bodies jerked and slumped, limbs moving like tangled puppets on invisible strings. The lights flickered and died. In the darkness, I could hear them: wet sliding noises and stiff, unnatural creaks that shouldn't come from human joints. The sounds were rhythmic, precise... like an assembly line at work.

When the lights returned, they were back in their seats, perfectly still. Their heads snapped upright with a sound like splintering wood, eyes facing forward... until they turned.

Their eyes. God, their eyes.

Each iris held a tinge of gold and red, like a solar eclipse painted on flesh. They didn't blink. They didn't move. Their heads remained perfectly still as their eyes tracked me. A woman three seats ahead had her arm bent backward at an impossible angle. It hung there until it snapped into place with a stiff, awful crack.

I woke up gasping, but the horror clung to me. Their eyes followed me into the waking world. I began seeing flashes of them—golden-red rings—in reflections: in mirrors, windows, even in the blank screen of my phone. Always watching, always present, just for a moment before vanishing.

I went to Dr. Lyra because I had nowhere else to turn. Simple tasks had become mountains. I couldn't function. She diagnosed it as stress and prescribed pills that made the world blur around the edges—not my vision, but my mind. Reality itself seemed smudged, painted over with something more... perfect.

When I stopped taking them, I thought it was over. But the world sharpened—too much. Colors became richer, sounds crisper—everything carried a weight that felt unnatural. Beneath it all, I started hearing things: soft stiff creaks when people moved, the faint click-click of pupils adjusting to light.

During my last appointment, Dr. Lyra's face lingered too long in a smile, as though she'd forgotten to stop.

""How are the pills working, Harvey?"" she asked, her tone breezy but flat. Her voice echoed strangely in the room, hollow like a metal chamber.

When I told her I wasn't taking them anymore, her expression froze. Everything stopped—not just her face, but the room itself. For a fraction of a second, I swear I saw her flicker, like a TV losing signal. Then she resumed, too quickly. Her voice piled on top of itself as her smile stretched wider than humanly possible.

""That's... great news. Wonderful progress. But I think you should keep taking them—just a little longer. For safety.""

Her hands trembled as she shoved another bottle into my hands, and I saw something... moving beneath her skin, as if her veins were alive and rearranging themselves.

I should have listened, but I didn't.

That's when I started noticing changes everywhere. The old corner store, once grimy and cluttered, gleamed with impossible cleanliness. The cashier, Mrs. Chen—always so grumpy and loud—stood behind the counter wearing an empty smile. Her head tilted exactly fifteen degrees as she rang up my items.

Then I saw the cat.

It sat by the road, perfectly still. Too still. Its posture was rigid, unnatural. When I approached, reaching out despite my instincts, its fur felt... wrong. Too smooth. Synthetic. Like plastic fibers pretending to be real hair.

Its head turned in sharp, stiff increments, click-click-click. And its eyes... those golden-red rings. Like camera shutters adjusting their focus. My breath caught, and the cat bolted, its movements precise and segmented.

I ran home and haven't left since. From my window, I watch, and I see it all. My neighbors' movements are too synchronized, their routines perfect. Mrs. Peterson waters her flowers at exactly 9:17 AM. Children play jump rope in flawless rhythm. Even their laughter stops and starts at precise intervals, as if on cue.

Whatever is happening, I need to figure it out before it gets to me. Am I going crazy? Am I being paranoid? The logical part of my brain screams that none of this is possible, but I've seen too much to trust logic anymore.

A knock at my door broke through my thoughts. Three precise taps, evenly spaced. Peering carefully from the corner of my window, relief washed over me as I recognized the visitors. My parents stood on the porch, wearing worried expressions that didn't quite reach their eyes. Of course—I hadn't been making my usual calls. I let them in, and they slipped into their roles: mother nagging about my self-care, father heading to the kitchen with bags they'd brought.

My mom switched to that gentle voice she'd always used when I was upset. Maybe this was what I needed after my self-imposed isolation. Maybe it was all just in my head. After all, I couldn't be wrong about my own parents. I felt warmth emanating from her as she held my hands, though something about her touch felt... rehearsed.

My dad was laughing in the kitchen, joking about what I'd been doing all this time. I finally felt relaxed, experiencing peace I hadn't known in weeks. Mom let me doze in her lap, just like when I was small. Her hand stroked my hair in perfect, metronomic motions.

Dad came in and saw me half-asleep. He went to the cabinet and retrieved something. Through my drowsy haze, I saw mom's smile shift, becoming more like Dr. Lyra's, more like Mrs. Chen's, more like the cat's mechanical grin. She held my head still as dad pressed that familiar pill to my lips.

""Just take your medicine, dear,"" she whispered, her voice harmonizing with mechanical undertones. ""Everything will be clearer once you stop fighting it.""

As darkness began to take hold, I heard snippets of their conversation, but the voices... no... it couldn't be.

""Why are we still keeping this one?"" My mother's voice had lost all warmth, becoming clinical and detached, layered with whirring sounds.

""Mhmm, an experiment more or less,"" my father's voice replied, but the familiar deep tone held none of its usual affection. ""The longest-lasting subject yet. Fascinating how he senses something's wrong but can't quite grasp what.""

Before my vision finally dimmed, I saw her face above me, frozen in that too-wide smile. Her eyes rotated—those golden-red rings locking onto me.

I try to fight the darkness, but I know it's too late. It always was.

I have a very frugal life already, post COVID prices were insane but it is not stopping. I keep a record of my expenses and this year has been brutal. 

Medical insurance up 20 %, Waternet 20 %. Food in INSANE, in the past years already moved into low cost protein like tofu and what I was paying less than 2 euros now is 3.5. A whole chicken 12, 13, 14 euros in mainstream supermarkets (I pay 7.50 for a ROASTED one in Brussels, where I spend some time every month for work). Coffee, bread, cheese. I bring stuff from Germany and Spain (also, travel for work) and I am constantly hunting for offers and I go to markets, turkish butcher, etc, but I feel like we are constantly losing options and being cornered, my lifestyle is now way, way worse than 5 years ago, and I am ""doing very well"" professionally, but is not paying off. Not to mention that professional services are both more expensive and the quality and even the most basic professionalism just disappeared, nobody gives a s\*\*t anymore.

As a 30 year old man, I haven't worked everything out about life yet, but if there's one thing I've definitely established it is the uncanny trait of these respective foods to show up and do their thing- that thing being making you feel shit. 

Sausage rolls, more often than not cause something I've nicknamed ""hot spew"", which isn't actual vomiting, but little appearances of molten hot stomach acid in the back of your throat, this is usually paired with a 'bothered feeling' eminating from the centre of your being. This doesn't occur from meat pies. 

Packaged iced coffees, magically make one nauseous, across many different brands. As a coffee person who has REAL coffee every and any type of way with NO ILL effects, it is specifically and uniquely 'packed iced coffees' that induce nausea and a light swirling, meandering dread. 

I wish the knob jockeys that are manufacturing these products would be Informed that whatever bullsh*t they are specifically adding to these two products isn't going unnoticed by everyone. 

Any clues what each of these may contain to cause these symptoms?

1hg6knc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hg6knc/bucky_the_buck/,BUCKY the Buck.,"Insane true story!

 About 30 yrs ago I had woken up in traverse city MI. To go to work as an electrician.  It was 6am. I had to be there at 7:30 and load up to get to the job at 8am or so!
Well after a half pot of coffee I was on my way from Benzonia to Traverse city, a 1+ hour drive. About 10 min from my destination on a very rural road, there was a car with hazards on!
 Like a fool I stopped,  Some random lady had hit a deer with her car and was in shock!
 Being greedy and needing the meat I told her I'll handle it and sent her on her way to wherever in her bloody car.
 I took a good look at the crushed doe and noticed it's stomach was moving . I also noticed a tiny hoof coming out it's rear 
 Like a super hero I jumped and pulled at the same time and managed to yank a newborn baby deer out of it's expired mom.
 It was wet and covered with spots on it's fur. I wrapped it in a blanket and took it to work!
 My boss was cool enough to let me take the day off!
I raced to quality farm and fleet and got a calf bottle and an 80lb bag of powered calf milk. Damn thing refused to take to the nipple. But then I realized it was cold! Well soon as I warmed it, it was on!!

I lived in a stone built farm house and the DNR said I could keep the fawn as long as it was outside.
I was very nervous but the fawn was so addicted to fawn milk it was always close even on a 200 acre cherry farm!!. 

After 3 wks I noticed my fawn was a buck and had knobs on its head! He was a buck so I called him Bucky!!! Well the damn thing came 3 times a day for its bottle.. Bucky would jump up on the screen door and trash it. He would try jumping through the windows! He was getting dangerous!

He stayed in the corn field and I would whistle for him! His head would bounce over the corn on his way in! Well soon I was his brother and he would butt me and stab at me with his hoofs. By now he was 3 and had spike horns! I was 25 at the time and me and bucky would wrestle before and after my work! On the weekends cars would line up on our street to watch us wrestle . It was brutal too cause he was 300 lbs and had horns. Regardless I loved that damn deer no matter how many stitches. 

One day I hog tied him and trucked him to sleeping bear dunes on Lk .Michigan. We ran down the dunes and people would come up to pet the deer. He followed me like a lost puppy but we would fight constantly lol. .

It was hot and sunny on the beach and we had 12 hrs of fun but when the sun set I had to hog tie him and drive him home..He was ok with it and never made a fuss. Well fall came around and Bucky started bringing other Wild deer around and a bunch of doe girlfriends. I was swarmed but it was epic. These wild animals accepted me and loved me! I was amazed!

Me wrestling with my adult buck on the sandy beach with news cameras and tons of on lookers!! I Loved Bucky. He was my best friend and brother. He gave me stitches and we wrestled constantly..Bucky was my best friend. When I wasn't working I was with Bucky..He was even at my wedding!

 I did him wrong, I introduced him to humans. Biggest mistake I ever made. That fall at the opening of Deer/Bow season. The very first day!! I never saw him again.. He probably walked right up to a hunter wanting a back scratch or to wrestle and the hunter killed him. 

I didn't save his life that day when his mama was killed by a car. I killed him by being his friend and brother in this messed up world. I'll never forget us jumping down the dunes and running down the beach..We even went swimming..Ever seen a spike horn white tail and a human swimming together in Lk.  MI? not no more!

1hg6kk6,https://i.redd.it/yw9qat6vhd7e1.jpeg,Help,"I've been working the night shift at Tesco since September of this year, and I rarely take breaks. At first, it was manageable—one thing I believe we Latinos often do is 'show off our hard work' to avoid being reprimanded or fired, and it usually pays off. I always receive praise and trust for the quality of my work.

However, December has arrived, and I am completely exhausted. It feels like much more is expected from me compared to other employees. My section—coffee, tea, and biscuits—is always the busiest. During December, most areas have two employees working together, but I work alone. They often leave me with 7 or 8 full cages to handle. On top of that, I don't take breaks, as I mentioned, and they keep asking for additional tasks after 6 AM, which is when my shift should end.

I’ve noticed that other employees leave at exactly 6, but I end up staying 30 minutes or more. I’m completely drained, but I need the money and the job. Does anyone have tips for overcoming this situation? I know they can’t fire me for taking my break, but when I see all those cages filled with products, I can’t help but think that if I stop, I won’t finish everything I need to do.",13,1734425626.0,tesco,36,0.76,False

His words stunned me and my heart leaped.
Did he have someone in mind he wanted as his mate?

It sure sounded as though he had someone he liked.

My heart throbbed.

I know I shouldn't feel this way, Bryson after all would obviously be attracted to girls...
A big part of me wanted him to be attracted to me but that was just wishful thinking.

Bryson was way out of my league, in looks and ranking.

It's actually laughable that I was so deeply in love with an alpha male who would never be mated to an omega like me.

Bryson sighs and rakes a hand through his hair. ""The closer my birthday comes the more agitated I get. I'm fearful of who I'll end up with knowing that the one I really want might not-

He groans and shakes his head. His eyes lift to mine and they connected. It feels like electricity is zapping around us as he holds me in an intense stare.

""In a few months, you'll be turning eighteen to Em. Aren't you afraid of who you'll end up with?"" He asked, staring at me deeply.

I tore my eyes away from him.

I've thought about who the moon goddess must've chosen for me and my mind always wraps back to maybe an omega or low-ranked male.

Omegas have never been mated to any higher-ranked wolves, it's not like I'd magically be mated to one now.

""I've thought about it a lot actually. And yes I'm terrified of that day."" I admitted.

I'm terrified that we won't have the same bond we have now.

Your main focus will be on your Luna and I'll be stuck with someone I have to force to fall in love with even though my heart belongs to you.

But instead of saying the truth, I sent him a shaky smile. ""But I figured the moon goddess won't fate me to a higher ranked wolf so I suppose I have nothing to fear of. You know how you higher ranked wolves are more maintenance."" I joked trying to ease the tension.

But it does the opposite because Bryson's brows knot into a frown and he grumbles. ""Right.""

He stares at me with an emotion he was quick to mask and then clears his throat. ""I guess we'll just have to wait and see who we end up with huh?""

I nodded grimly.

I didn't want to end up with anyone else other than Bryson. I was in love with him and I was afraid that even with a mate that's not him, I'd never be able to get over him.
_

""You better take your time today,"" I warned him as I buckled myself.

Bryson shoots me a grin and winks. ""No promises.""

I gripped the door quickly as he drove off.
""Bryson Taylor!"" I yelled in anger.

He roared with laughter and then slowed down. I turn to shoot him a glare.

""I swear you're just trying to piss me off.""
The corner of his mouth lifted into a smirk as he spared me a glance. ""You're hot when you're pissed off, I can't help it."" He joked but there was something weighing in his tone that made it a bit hoarse.

Again, his words always seem to make me stop breathing for a few. But then I always remember that Bryson was always a teaser and he loved to tease me. Those words had no real meaning behind them. They were just that, words.

Even though I wanted them to mean so much more.

With a raging blush on my face that I failed to hide, I rip my eyes away from him and focus on the road while I murmur. ""Shut up. ""

He chuckles and the sound sent a warm rush of tingles fluttering in my stomach.

When we got to my place Bryson said he'd much rather warm up the food in fear that I'd 'burn' down the house.

""Whatever,"" I said and rolled my eyes.
I left him and went upstairs to freshen up.
When I got back upstairs, Bryson is already seated on the sofa, his feet kicked up on the coffee table.

""Aren't you supposed to have a meeting with your dad today about the alpha ceremony?"" I asked as I approached him.

Not only was Bryson turning the age of eighteen in a couple of days, but he would also be passed down the alpha title. He will now be the alpha leader of the pack.

Something he's been training for relentlessly.
He looks up at me and I didn't fail to notice the way his eyes dipped for a few seconds on my breasts area and legs.

I blushed and he clears his throat while reaching over for the remote. ""Like I'd leave you home alone Em. I mind linked my dad, we'll talk about it tomorrow.""

I winced.

Brent Taylor, alpha of our pack, was a bit more stern. Especially when it came to pack business.

""Was he upset?"" I winced as I plopped beside him.

I let out a tiny breath when his arm slings around my shoulder and he pulled me closer to his side.

""Nah not really. He understood. It's really not a big deal Em. Alpha duties can come after, you'll always come first.""

I swallowed the lump in my throat. When he says words like that it makes me want to beg him to kiss me at least once before he'll never be mine again.

But that wasn't a possibility. We were best friends and he only saw me as his little sister.

""I just don't want to be the reason you're missing out on your duties Bryce. You'll take over the pack in literally a few days. "" I whispered and peeked at him under my lashes.
I hear his sharp intake of breath when our eyes connected and furrow my brows when he rips them away quickly.

""I have enough time Em. Now stop being so worried."" He whispered and switched through the movies and picked one I liked even though he didn't like that kind of genre.

I smiled and lay my head on his shoulder.
-

A few hours had passed and now it was dark out. The only light in the house was coming from the television.

We had eaten a few hours ago and now I was exhausted.

I yawned, my eyes fluttering closed until sleep washed over me. It was only when I felt myself being lifted did my eyes slowly fluttered open.

In my hazy mind and vision, I spotted Bryson's eyes staring down at me. ""Go back to sleep Em, I got you."" He whispered and my eyes followed his command.

I can hear his footfalls as he walked up the stairs, feel his arms hold me protectively to his chest. Hear the steady beating of his heart in his chest.

And then soon, I felt the soft covers under me as I sank into the mattress. He fixed me and pulled the covers over my legs to my midsection.

But when I thought he was gone, I felt the hovering presence of him above me then felt the softness of his lips on the corner of my mouth.

""Goodnight baby."" He whispered, his lips lingering there.",1,1734425524.0,GoodNovelHub,0,1.0,False

(I’ve posted before and had some good conversations, but it didn’t lead anywhere. This time, I’m sharing an updated version of my profile based on what I learned from those experiences.)

I’m 27, 5'6"", and work as a Software Engineer with both a bachelor’s and master’s in Software Engineering basically a complete coding nerd. I’m from the city of lights and khaddas. 😭.

Sect: Sunni
Caste: Urdu Speaking 

About Me:
-  Ambivert—I enjoy planning outings with friends and family, usually love to drive at night post my coffee run. 
- Not much of a web series person. I hardly watch any ig thats the result of reels and short form content. 
- I try to stay fit by going to the gym, mostly to balance out my love for food especially meetha. 😅
- Love to travel (whenever my workplace decides not to load me with bugs) and hope to explore more with my future partner. 
- I believe in mutual respect and understanding in a relationship, especially when times get tough. Compatibility is super important to me—more than just being a great match on paper, I think what truly makes a marriage work is how two people support each other.
- While I enjoy my job now, I’m open to having the flexibility to decide whether or not to work in the future.
- Very actively trying to move out of the country via job/immigration. 

Religion:
I’m a moderately practicing person as I follow namaz, roza religiously and have stayed away from smoking/drugs/alcohol/physical relationships. I believe religion is personal—it's between each of us and Allah, and I don’t judge people on their journey. I’m not perfect either I just want the person to not be completely away from religion.

Im looking for Someone who is God fearing, kind , compassionate, cares about huqul ibad and not just huqul Allah, I've seen enough examples of people who follow all the obligations and still turn out ugly from the inside. 

If you're one to judge people based on their number of rozas and namaz I'm not a good match for you as I don’t. 🙏 

One thing to note: I don’t dress modestly and my bodily autonomy and personal style are non-negotiable. If you have conditions around how I dress—we're not a match.

Kids:
Yes, but not right away and not too many. I want to take time to build a strong bond with my husband first before we bring a child into this world.

Family: I strongly advocate for the privacy of all parties involved. I believe a couple can maintain their privacy while still having a good relationship with their family. Living together often leads to domestic issues and can create a toxic environment for everyone, so I prefer a setup that prioritizes personal space and healthy boundaries. 

What I’m Looking For in a Partner:
Basics:
  - Single/Never married 
  - Well-educated   
  - Not older than 31  
  - Financially stable ( not asking for you to be Ambani but someone who can provide and take the responsibility in the long run of the wife and kids )
  - Height > 5.6 
  - Open-minded
- Sunni
- Would be nice if the person is also from my field ( a person that can get the jokes ya know?)  but its a not deal breaker.
- Someone from karachi or family based out of karachi if the person is abroad so that families can easily meetup and get to know each other. ( Not a deal breaker ) 

Personality & Traits:
I’m drawn to people who are self-aware, emotionally available, supportive, and open-minded. You don’t have to be Fawad Khan, but someone who takes care of themselves is definitely a plus. A strong mental connection is key for me, and I’d prefer to get to know someone before getting families involved. To me, marriage is a partnership—both people need to put in effort and support each other, with plenty of room for companionship and independence.  

Deal Breakers:
- If you’re into drugs, drinking, vaping/smoking or casual physical relationships.  (If you have been in the past and donot continue anymore thats fine for me, I'm more concerned about the present )
- Conservative, narrow minded or controlling.
- No sense of direction or ambition in life.  
- Following traditions just for the sake of it, without thought.
- Emotionally unavailable
- Stingy and not generous when it comes to your family. 
- Lack of understanding with regards to privacy.
- Is unable to take decisions about life independently. 

Timeline: 1 year/ we can decide mutually

The one thing that continues to be a problem is his behaviour around my parents 3-year old cockapoo - he is obsessed! It’s been this way since he was a much younger puppy, where basically he just barks in his face constantly trying to get him to play. He doesn’t take any body language cues from my parents dog and he just gets more and more overaroused as the day goes on. This is mostly a problem when we visit their house, we’ve been away together in campervans and he’s a little better in this situation. 

We have tried quite a few things to help, including:
- regularly taking the dogs on walks together in neutral locations (he’s still obsessed, but generally this is fine, we also stop for coffee and generally he’s fine there too)
- a big walk together before we go back to their house to tire him out and make sure they have time to play together 
- quick time outs when he barks 
- distracting with training / playing find-it / long-lasting chews

Our next move is going to be taking the crate with us to their house and doing the time outs / treats etc in there to try and convince him to sleep for a bit. As a puppy this is the only way we got him to sleep in our house (and now he happily sleeps most of the day outside the crate) so we’re hoping it might work in that environment. 

Has anyone experienced this themselves and found something that helped? I know he’s going through adolescence and it’s not surprising he wants to play all day, but I’m struggling with the balance of “he’s a puppy, he’ll grow out of it” and “if we don’t try and train him out of it, it will never change”.

I just got my Rivelia and spent yesterday having a mess around with it.

One thing I don't understand, is what the machine does when you select the 'my' option. I find the flat whites too milky, even with an extra shot. I know that everything is different but essentially I like a double shot of espresso with about the same amount of foamy milk to top it up. When I go in to the 'my' option, the machine basically keeps on spitting out black coffee until you tell it to stop. But what is this black coffee?? Is it just pushing through more and more water from the same amount of coffee til you tell it to stop? Seems pretty weird to me. Was thinking same for the other options when it allows you to control the amount of coffee for, e.g. the coffee option, long coffee, even cappuccino. Surely it isn't pulling an espresso and then just continuing to push water through until you tell it to stop. Why would you want that?

For my wedding, I gave my bridesmaids about 200USD cash each (customary good luck gift in Chinese culture). I also booked an Airbnb so we could all be together the night before, as well as their dresses, a gift set, coffees and most of the transportation on the wedding day. These were all paid for by me and intended as gifts. In total I spent about 500USD on each bridesmaid. 

After wedding day, my husband and I looked through the gifts we received, but found none from any of the bridesmaids. That stung but I decided to let it go. But the final straw was when one of the bridesmaids asked me for my share of one taxi ride from our AirBnB to the afterparty.. My share was less than 1USD. 
Still, I wondered if it could be a misunderstanding and maybe all along they expected to split all costs (which would explain why they didn't give even a token gift) so I asked if we are expensing everything, then I'd also add in all my expenses and ask to split them. They told me to expense them, so I added the AirBnb expense to the splitwise (didn't even add all the meals and transportation that I paid for) Things got really awkward after that. 
1 of the bridesmaids went totally silent
1 quietly paid me for the AirBnB
And 1 sent me a barrage of angry messages in all caps calling me names.. 

I'm not sure what the bridesmaid etiquette is everywhere as I'm the first of my friends to get married. I'm not rich, but I like to be generous with my friends so the $500 I spent on them really did hurt my wallet. I wasn't looking to break even on the money I spent on them, but I feel like a gift of any monetary value is a basic gesture of friendship, especially from the people closest to you? So AITA for asking them to pay me back after everything? ",1,1734424324.0,AITAH,3,0.6,False

However, I asked two female friends of mine and they said that maybe she didn't get that I was asking her with a romantic intention and that maybe I should ask her again in the future after I spend some more time talking with her. I'm against asking her again (because a no is a no, I don't want to be rude and make her uncomfortable), but I would like your opinion if she got that I asked her for a coffee with a romantic intention. Should I have said that I liked her, too? My personal opinion on that is that it was better not saying to her that I liked her, because flirting contains a mystery (does he/she like me or not? etc.).

---

The days were now filled with mounting effort as Tomozaki and his friends continued to fight to reach Hinami. Each interaction brought new challenges, but they never stopped, driven by a collective commitment to remind Hinami that perfection was an illusion—and that imperfection was not something to be ashamed of.

Despite their persistence, Tomozaki knew their situation was getting harder. Hinami continued to isolate herself, avoiding the group at every turn. She became even colder, more distant, and more unyielding. It felt as if every step forward only took them two steps back. Yet Tomozaki couldn't stop. Not now. Not when Hinami was slipping further away.


---

Encounter with Kikuchi - Café After School

One afternoon, Tomozaki met Kikuchi-san at their usual spot at a nearby café. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, and the soft clinking of mugs created a cozy atmosphere. But Tomozaki noticed that Kikuchi’s normally calm and composed demeanor was beginning to wear down.

She gazed into her cup, her fingers tracing the rim absentmindedly. “Tomozaki-kun,” she finally said, her voice trembling slightly, “I’ve tried everything. We’ve tried everything. But I feel like I’m just... failing. Like none of it’s working.”

Tomozaki shook his head. “We haven’t failed yet. We just need a new plan. A different way. Hinami isn’t someone who gives up easily, but right now, she’s pushing us away. We need to break through that barrier.”

Kikuchi took a sip of her coffee, the warmth of the drink doing little to ease the anxiety in her eyes. “She’s like a reflection in a magic mirror. A mirror that only shows the perfect version of herself. The version that doesn’t let failure tarnish that image. She won’t let anyone see the real her—not even us.”

Tomozaki nodded slowly, absorbing her words. “It’s like she’s created a life where failing means collapsing into ruin. Every imperfection threatens everything she’s built. But we need to remind her that true strength isn’t in perfection. It’s in vulnerability. In growth.”

She glanced up, her eyes searching his face for some hint of hope. “How do we do that, Fumiya?”

Tomozaki paused, a flicker of inspiration sparking in his chest. “We need to create a moment where Hinami has no choice but to let us in. We’ll show her that failing, struggling, and being imperfect is not a curse—it’s a path to becoming stronger. We need to let her see that in us.”


---

Taking Action - A Collaborative Plan

Together, they brainstormed a plan. Tomozaki gathered the group—Mimimi, Izumi, Nakamura, Mizusawa, and Kikuchi—after school on the rooftop. The sun was setting, casting a purplish hue over the city skyline. The atmosphere was serious but resolute.

“We need an event,” Tomozaki said, his voice filled with conviction. “A gathering where we all put ourselves out there. No pretense, no perfection. Just us, showing who we really are.”

Nakamura raised an eyebrow. “Like what? A sports match? A talent show? We don’t have time for that kind of thing.”

“It could be anything,” Tomozaki replied. “The point isn’t winning or losing. It’s about showing Hinami that we all have flaws. That it’s okay to stumble and fall. What matters is standing back up together.”

Mimimi nodded, her eyes sparkling with energy. “Let’s do a sports event. We’ll mix things up. Everyone has to play, even if they aren’t good at sports. The whole point will be about participating, not winning.”

Izumi wiped a tear from her eye, her voice filled with determination. “Let’s include everyone—students, teachers, everyone. We’ll make it about teamwork. Let’s show Hinami that support and cooperation matter more than individual success.”

Kikuchi, always the quiet voice of reason, added, “Let’s make it personal. We’ll share stories. Moments where we failed and learned, where we were weak but found strength. Let Hinami see that failing doesn’t mean defeat—it means learning and growing stronger.”

Nakamura, despite his usual skepticism, nodded slowly. “Fine. Let’s do it. If it means reaching Aoi, we’ll try anything.”


---

The Event - Hinami’s Arrival

The day of the event finally arrived, and the school grounds were bustling with energy. Banners were hung, sports equipment was scattered around, and students from different classes came together to participate. The air was filled with laughter, competition, and camaraderie.

But Tomozaki’s eyes constantly searched for Hinami. Finally, she appeared, walking across the field with an aloof grace that seemed to set her apart from the rest of the group. She wore her usual perfect expression—a mask of unyielding confidence.

Hinami stood on the sidelines, arms crossed, observing the event with a cold, critical gaze. She didn’t participate, didn’t cheer, and barely acknowledged anyone. Her gaze met Tomozaki’s briefly, and for a moment, something flickered in her eyes—a brief doubt, an imperceptible crack.

Tomozaki approached her slowly, his heart pounding. “Hinami, you don’t have to stand there. Come join us. Let’s show you that failing is just a part of life.”

She didn’t respond, just turned her gaze away, her expression slipping into her usual indifference.

But then, Mimimi, breathless from a game she had just lost, stumbled onto the sidelines, laughing. “I fell hard there. But you know what? It’s fun. Even losing feels good when we’re all in it together!”

Izumi joined them, sharing her own embarrassing experience in a soccer match where she had missed every attempt to score. “But we all laughed at it. We learned. We didn’t win, but we learned teamwork. That’s what really matters.”

Nakamura, surprisingly earnest, added, “We all fail sometimes. But that doesn’t mean we stop. It means we fight harder, together.”

Finally, Kikuchi stepped forward. “Hinami, let us show you who we really are. Not as people who never fail, but as people who stand up after every stumble, together. We’re here for you—not because we’re perfect, but because we care.”

Hinami looked at each of them, her carefully maintained mask slipping for a moment. Her eyes filled with confusion, a flicker of vulnerability breaking through.

Tomozaki felt a swell of hope. “Come on, Hinami. Be part of us. Let’s fail together. Let’s learn together.”

Hinami paused, staring at Tomozaki. For a fleeting moment, she nodded. Slowly, she stepped onto the field, ready to try—even if it meant stumbling. The barriers she had built around herself were not broken entirely, but the seed of change had been planted.


---

Conclusion

That day wasn’t about winning; it was about showing Hinami that imperfection was not a curse but an opportunity. The group stood together, stronger than ever, reminding Hinami that real success lay in support, resilience, and unity.

Tomozaki felt a renewed commitment to keep fighting for Hinami, knowing that with each attempt, no matter the failure, they would rebuild their bond. It wasn’t about perfection—it was about standing together through every challenge, growing stronger as individuals and as a group, knowing that true friendship meant showing up, failing, learning, and rising again—together.

1hg65k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hg65k4/discovering_the_lifewater_hydrogen_water_bottle/,Discovering the LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle: My Journey to Better Hydration,"I’ll be honest—hydration has always been one of those things I’ve struggled with. I’d drink water throughout the day but still feel sluggish, experience occasional headaches, and notice my skin wasn’t as clear as it used to be. It felt like I was doing everything right, but something was missing. That’s when I came across the concept of **hydrogen water bottles**, and eventually, the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**.

At first, I was skeptical. It’s water—how different could it be? But the more I read about molecular hydrogen and its potential health benefits, the more curious I became. So, I decided to give it a try. Here’s what I’ve learned and experienced over the past few weeks with this unique bottle.

# What Makes the LifeWater Water Bottle Unique?

The **lifewater bottle** is not your average reusable bottle. What sets it apart is its ability to transform ordinary water into hydrogen-rich water using advanced molecular hydrogen technology. In simpler terms, it infuses your water with hydrogen gas, which is believed to have numerous health benefits, including:

* Reducing inflammation.
* Boosting energy levels.
* Supporting better skin health.
* Improving hydration efficiency.

Using patented electrolysis technology, the **lifewater water bottle** creates nano-bubbles of hydrogen in the water, making it more bioavailable for your body. The process takes just three minutes, and the water tastes just like regular water—no weird aftertaste.

# Why Hydrogen Water?

Before I jump into my personal experience, let’s talk about why hydrogen water is gaining so much attention. Research suggests that hydrogen-infused water acts as a potent antioxidant, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. This can lead to:

* **Improved cellular hydration**: Regular water doesn’t always hydrate you at the cellular level, which is why some people still feel thirsty despite drinking a lot.
* **Reduced oxidative stress**: This means it could help with inflammation, aging, and even muscle recovery.
* **Boosted energy and focus**: By supporting better cell function, hydrogen water may naturally increase your energy levels.

# My First Week with the LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle

When I first received the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**, I was impressed by its sleek design. It’s compact, easy to carry, and looks great on my desk. The setup was simple—charge the base, fill the bottle with water, press the button, and wait three minutes for the hydrogen infusion to finish.

Here’s what I noticed during my first week:

1. **Energy Levels**: I felt more awake and alert in the mornings, even before my usual cup of coffee. By mid-week, I realized I wasn’t relying on caffeine as much to get through the day.
2. **Skin Clarity**: I have mild acne, especially around my chin, and I noticed it started to calm down after a few days of drinking hydrogen water.
3. **Hydration**: This was the biggest difference for me. I felt genuinely hydrated in a way I hadn’t before—no more dry mouth or feeling thirsty after drinking a full glass.

# Who Should Try the LifeWater Bottle?

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** is ideal for a wide range of people:

* **Fitness enthusiasts**: It’s great for improving hydration during workouts and speeding up recovery afterward.
* **Those with inflammation issues**: If you deal with conditions like arthritis or gout, hydrogen water might help reduce symptoms.
* **Busy professionals**: It’s perfect for staying hydrated and energized throughout the day.
* **Anyone looking to improve their hydration game**: Whether you struggle to drink enough water or want to optimize your water intake, this bottle is a great tool.

# How Does It Work?

The science behind the **lifewater bottle** is pretty fascinating. It uses a Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE) and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gets infused into the water, creating hydrogen-rich water, while the oxygen and other gases are safely vented out.

Here are some of its standout features:

* **Quick Infusion**: It takes only 3 minutes to create hydrogen-rich water.
* **No Maintenance**: There’s no need for filter replacements or extra upkeep.
* **Portable and Durable**: It’s lightweight, leakproof, and built to last.
* **Safe for Everyone**: The bottle is even suitable for children and pregnant women.

# Benefits I’ve Noticed Over Time

After using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** consistently for a few weeks, I’ve seen several benefits:

1. **Improved Recovery**: After workouts, I don’t feel as sore as I used to. Hydrogen water seems to help with muscle recovery.
2. **Mental Clarity**: My focus has improved, especially during long workdays.
3. **Better Skin**: My skin feels more hydrated and looks clearer.
4. **Sustained Energy**: I no longer experience the afternoon energy crash I used to get.

It’s not a miracle cure, but it’s made a noticeable difference in my daily life.

# What I Like Most

* **Ease of Use**: The one-button operation makes it simple to use.
* **No Taste Difference**: The water tastes clean and refreshing, just like regular water.
* **Eco-Friendly Design**: It’s reusable and helps reduce reliance on plastic bottles.

# Potential Downsides

* **Price**: It’s more expensive than a regular water bottle, but considering the technology and benefits, I think it’s worth it.
* **Charging**: You need to charge it every few days, which might be inconvenient for some.

# Final Thoughts

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** is a fantastic tool for anyone looking to improve their hydration and overall wellness. It’s not a magic solution, but it does make a difference, especially if you’re dealing with issues like fatigue, skin concerns, or inflammation. For me, the biggest takeaway has been the importance of hydration—and how much better I feel when I prioritize it.

If you’re curious about the benefits of hydrogen water, this bottle is an excellent place to start. It’s easy to use, portable, and packed with innovative technology that makes hydration more effective.

1hg63a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1hg63a2/advice_needed_intuition_failed/,Advice needed- intuition failed?,"TLDR: I (INTJ, f, 30) met my other half (INTJ,m, 40), fucked it up, now wondering if I should pursue since my intuition keeps nagging against heart and head. Seeking advice. 

I met a fellow INTJ and had an otherworldly connection with him, he felt it too, and mentioned it. I was going through a rough time and went a little nuts from the stress after we worked on a very short project together that ended depressingly badly due to neither of us being able to keep up with our busy lives. 
We distanced for a while. Ended up sending him a mean email (I have apologized, he accepted but continues distance and we have expressed about it blatantly), a few sappy ones, and at least one or two batshit crazy ones. I would have doorslammed someone into next tomorrow if it were me, but since we are connected loosely by work, we are in very limited contact, though clearly we are both distancing from each other. 

I’m not even sure if I even want to see him (we have only met in person once, briefly) and I would rather die than meet if I were in his position, but my intuition keeps nagging at me to pursue him. I’ve never felt anything like this before, my intuition brought us together and things had lined up before, as intuition often begets. However it has not been like that since the end of the project. 

I could ask him to coffee this week, but I’m afraid of rejection or worse, awkwardness. However the pit of my soul is angrily screaming at me to seek him out, against all heart and head.

My intuition has never failed me once before, I feel cheated simply by going through with prior events. I can’t imagine my intuition is wrong but it might be this time? 

Anyone ever have something like this? Any advice? We got incredibly close and personal in the time before we distanced. It was like meeting my mirror, the good times were indescribably blissful and pure for both of us, just chatting and feeling completely understood. I don’t think we could trust each other now even if we did meet. But maybe he feels the same confusion I do. Feels like my intuition is shouting “wrong way!” the more I distance myself in thought or action from him..
