But it was a part of a dream I had randomly. I was writing a creative writing story for english and I just decided to plaguerize and episode of Goseiger despite never having watched a single episode of Goseiger.

So the story went with the a coffee themed Kaijin that some how really defeating the Sentai team, with them begging for it to stop. The Kaijin then rips off their suit or make them detransform before breaking their weapon and pouring coffee over it.

That part because for second I thought it was piss and that confused me enough to where I just woke up.

1k0f7y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0f7y8/aitah_for_choosing_to_hang_out_with_my_boyfriend/,AITAH for choosing to hang out with my boyfriend instead of my friends?,"My post got deleted from AITA, so I'm reposting here.

Using a throwaway because some of my friends have Reddit.

For context: I (21F) go to university about 20 hours from my hometown. My boyfriend (21M) lives 5 hours away from my hometown, so we are long-distance no matter where we are.

Basically, this past holiday season, I went home for a month for winter break. My boyfriend and I had made plans for him to come visit me the week before Christmas since we hadn't seen each other in 2 months. My friend, ""Stacy"" (22F), and I hung out a lot while I was home, and I had told her how excited I was to see my boyfriend on multiple occasions.

The day that my boyfriend came to my city, Stacy texted me asking to hang out. I told her I couldn't, because my boyfriend was there. She said okay, and we moved on. A few hours later, a mutual friend, ""Alice"" (21F), texted a groupchat with Stacy and me, asking if we wanted to go out for dinner. I replied to the text and declined, explaining that my boyfriend was with me. Alice said he was free to join us if he wanted to, but I said no because I didn't want to impose, plus I just wanted some 1-on-1 time with him.

Stacy called me immediately after I sent that text and asked me why I wasn't going to dinner with them. I restated all my reasons, and I told her that I would love to go the next weekend if they wanted to. She got upset with me, saying that I was choosing my boyfriend over my friends.

Now, this is the part where I may be the AH: I told her that it wasn't fair of her to say that when she consistently bails on all of us at the last minute to go on various dates. I also said that I would rather spend time with my boyfriend, who I haven't seen in 2 months, than go out with them and get drunk for the 4th night in a row.

She hung up on me after I said that, and that was that. After my boyfriend left a few days later, I texted our groupchat and asked them if they wanted to get dinner that weekend since I was free. Nobody responded to me. I sent another (unrelated) text a few hours later, and they responded to that one. Then, I resent my question about the dinner plans because I figured they had just been busy earlier and hadn't seen it. Again, nobody responded. I realized that they may have been upset with me, so I texted Alice privately asking if everything was okay. She said that she was fine, but Stacy had been complaining in a separate groupchat, calling me an AH and saying that I didn't care about my friends.

I hadn't spoken to Stacy since then, but this past weekend, I went home to visit my family, and I figured I would reach out. I invited her out to grab coffee and talk, but she didn't respond.

So, was I the AH?

1. I joined a IT company after switching in 2021. I liked a colleague very much . She worked in my team only . She was Senior Software Engineer and i was a Software Engineer (1 year older than me ). Her smile was elegant and her voice was very soothing, one of the most beautiful girl, i ever saw in life. I saw her in office in march 20222 due to covid wfh . I instantly fell for her.
2. I wish i could ask her for date , i was very close to it . But suddenly some problems came in my life , i decided to resolve it and become a better version of myself and will ask for date in sep 2022 . That was my target . We used to go for lunch together in team and used to share food also .
3. Later 1 day I got to know from my manager that she got engaged (arranged by parents in the same caste  )on some 11 july 2022 . I didn't knew about it . I cried that night alone in my room .She didn't informed me as maybe i was not so close to her . I felt devastated and cried for whole day . I knew i had no option to move on . It was very difficult , i cried for so many days . She got married in November. She invited all office colleagues and so i also went , bought a nice gift and i wrote a message (May ur life is filled with love and happiness ). she wore a green saree in reception, My heart was burning, but i could not do anything . I wanted to switch the job , but couldn't. I had to see her office daily .. used to talk to her normally. We were three people in the team me, the girl and her best friend. Still many times i cooked dishes for them and took it to office. I knew she could never be mine but i wanted her to be happy. I remained a fun loving friend only .
4. I knew i had to move on so in 2023 i started searching girl for me in matrimony (as dating seemed to hard for me ). in 2024 june i got engaged and in dec 2024 i got married to a wonderful person . I told her about the colleague also . She understood me a lot .
5. Now it is 2025 april 15 , yesterday her best friend told me that the girl got divorced in 2023 only and now on 10 th april she got remarried. I was shocked to core, i just sat there.Her friend told that since u are a friend and u share ur things to us so we wanted to share it with u.
6. for the whole time I used to go lunch with them, walk with them, used to have coffee with them ,i never knew this issue. I knew that some problems were there but not till this extent. I overcame a lot of feelings and moved on life whole time i used to discuss with them that i am searching to marry someone(no caste barrier ). I used to tell them that i got rejected by many girls . That was the time she was in the divorce process. the timelines were matching.
7. Now it is 16 th april , i haven't slept yesterday night. so many thoughts has crossed  my minds. The problems she went through it , i never knew it . If i knew she got divorced i would have asked her for date . I would have  moved mountains to be with her . Fate is so cruel .  

I still regret that i should have asked for date in 2022 only  ( i waited to become perfect person , solve my    problems .) . Life would have been diferent . Even if she said no , i would have been happy  . We cannot force someone to love us . I wish i had switched job after her marriage i could have forgotten her . Instead  i let myself burn for these years and when i moved on i am burning now again .

I discussed this with my wife yesterday , she hugged me and said things will be okay . She is the best person for me , but this stupid mind is racing and heart is sad !! i cried today on my fate .

SO i wish i had asked her on date in 2022 , i would have got my answer !! this much only i wanted to say .",1,1744790941.0,IndianRelationships,0,1.0,False

1k0f2pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyHealing/comments/1k0f2pd/social_anxiety_isnt_just_being_shyheres_what_it/,Social Anxiety Isn’t Just “Being Shy”—Here’s What It *Actually* Feels Like (and What Helps),"### *You ever rehearse a “casual” conversation twelve times… and still not say a word?*

If you’ve ever stood outside a gathering, hyping yourself up for 15 solid minutes only to pretend to get a “very important text” and walk away—yep, you might be intimately familiar with social anxiety.

And let’s get something straight: this isn’t about being “introverted” or needing “to come out of your shell.” Social anxiety is a whole-body experience. It’s the racing heart, the clammy palms, the invisible chokehold that tightens just when you’re about to speak. It’s mental gymnastics at every coffee shop, meeting, group chat, and dinner table.

But here’s the good news—social anxiety isn’t who you are. It’s something you experience. And it can be managed. Not with snap-your-fingers solutions, but with small, steady shifts that actually make a difference.

---

## **It’s Not Just Nerves—It’s a Constant “What If” Machine**

Social anxiety’s favorite question?  
> “What if I say something stupid?”

Followed closely by:  
> “What if they think I’m awkward?”  
> “What if I don’t know where to put my hands?”

These aren’t just fleeting thoughts—they’re sticky. They show up before, during, and after social interactions like clingy ghosts, whispering critiques of everything you did (or *didn’t*) say.

And the kicker? Even when things go *fine*, the brain still likes to replay the moment frame by frame, looking for signs that you messed it up.

It’s exhausting. And honestly, unfair. Because chances are, you’re thoughtful. You care about how others feel. You probably notice the small things most people miss. Social anxiety just puts all that awareness into overdrive.

---

## **“Just Be Yourself” Is Cute, But Also... What Does That *Mean*?**

You’ve heard it, right? That charming little phrase:  
> “You just need to be yourself!”

Honestly? That’s like telling someone with a broken leg to just “walk it off.”

When social anxiety is high, “being yourself” feels impossible. Your thoughts are moving too fast, your body feels hijacked, and you’re constantly scanning the room for micro-signs that someone might be judging you.

Here’s a more helpful approach: Try to **be kind to yourself first**, then let that version of you do the talking. It’s subtle, but powerful. You don’t have to *perform* confidence—you just need to quiet the panic enough to let your real voice squeak through.

---

## **The Body Keeps Score (and Sometimes, It’s Loud)**

If you’ve ever left a conversation and immediately felt your shoulders cramp or your jaw ache, that’s not just random tension. It’s your nervous system in survival mode.

Social anxiety lives in the body just as much as the brain. You might:

- Avoid eye contact without realizing it  
- Clench your teeth (hi, headaches)  
- Speak too quietly, or not at all  
- Forget what you were saying mid-sentence and feel the heat rise up your neck  

It’s not “just in your head.” It’s real, physical stuff. That’s why calming the body can be just as important as challenging the thoughts.

**Gentle tip:** Before walking into a stressful social situation, try grounding. Wiggle your toes in your shoes. Place your hand on your chest. Take a slow breath and exhale longer than you inhale. It’s tiny—but it tells your nervous system: *You’re safe. You’ve got this.*

---

## **A Random Tangent: The Group Chat Paralysis**

Can we talk about texting anxiety for a second?

You know that moment when someone in the group chat says something funny or vulnerable, and you stare at your screen trying to craft the “perfect” response—but 40 minutes pass and now it feels *too late*?

Yep. Social anxiety loves group chats too. It’s not about being rude or distant—it’s that weird pressure to say something *just right*, to avoid awkward silence or misinterpretation. Sometimes, it's easier to disappear than risk sending something that might land weird.

But remember: your people want *you*, not your curated replies. Silence is normal. Imperfect messages are normal. Honestly, most people are just glad you're there.

---

## **How Do You Actually Work Through It?**

Here’s the unglamorous truth: there’s no quick-fix cure for social anxiety. But there *are* tools that work over time—especially if you’re consistent, gentle, and realistic with yourself.

Let’s break it down:

- **Gradual exposure > Big leaps.** Don’t push yourself into a giant party when a 5-minute coffee with a coworker already spikes your heart rate. Start small. Build your “social muscle” with micro-interactions—chatting with a barista, complimenting someone’s earrings.  
- **Don’t fight the anxiety—notice it.** Anxiety loves resistance. Instead of trying to squash it, try saying: “Oh hey, that’s my social anxiety showing up. I see you.” Weirdly enough, naming it makes it less powerful.  
- **Rehearse, then let it go.** If you’re the rehearsing type (same), go ahead—practice the conversation. But give it a time limit. Rehearse once or twice, then *trust the moment*. You’re allowed to wing it.  
- **[Therapy](https://therapyrank.com/online-therapy) helps.** Like, *really* helps. Cognitive Behavioral [Therapy](https://therapyrank.com/online-therapy) (CBT) is proven effective for social anxiety. And if traditional [therapy](https://therapyrank.com/online-therapy) feels too overwhelming? Try text-based platforms like BetterHelp or Callmery. Start from a place that feels manageable.  

---

## **Social Anxiety Doesn’t Make You Weak—It Means You *Care***

Let’s be clear: if you’re reading this and nodding along, you are not broken. You’re not defective. You’re not too much or too sensitive.

You’re a person with a nervous system that’s doing the absolute *most*—because it wants to protect you. It just doesn’t always know when to chill.

Social anxiety is hard. It makes simple things feel monumental. It makes connection feel scary. But it also means you're probably more aware, more considerate, and more emotionally intelligent than you give yourself credit for.

The key? Start small. Be patient. Get curious about your patterns. And when you need a break from social expectations, take it. That doesn’t mean you're giving up—it means you're human.

---

## **Last Thought—You’re Already Brave**

If you’ve shown up to a party and made small talk while sweating bullets? That’s brave.

If you’ve answered a phone call when your heart was pounding? Brave.

If you’ve sent a text even though your stomach dropped the second you hit send? So brave.

Your anxiety might not go away overnight. But your life isn’t on pause while you figure it out. You can still connect. Still belong. Still take up space.

Social anxiety’s voice might be loud—but yours still matters. And you don’t have to wait for perfect confidence to start speaking.

[Originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/s/f7atqACULr) in r/sugarbabyonlyforum on 3/12/24

So I've been in the sugar bowl for a few years now and I've been seriously looking for a new SD since last Dec. I recently went through a violent breakup (not sugar) and a horrible Seeking experience (tl;dr ended up in the hospital completing a R kit and toxicology..). It's been a rough few months to say the least and it took a toll on my mental health that all this happened PLUS I've been falling behind in school because my hunt is taking longer than I thought it would.

I've recently been speaking to a POT that I happened to open up to about my situation and we had our M&G today. Upon seeing me, he asked me for the hug that I promised him and immediately handed me $2000 just to comfort me about my recent stressors. The date itself went well because he was already quite smitten with me and he's the type to just share stories with no need for me to put in much effort in entertaining him. After he treated me to brunch, he insisted I get a coffee and some pastries to go as well and he drove me back to my condo area. He even checked during the date that I'm feeling alright and comfortable (even though we were in a very busy cafe). 

I just wanted to share because I've been going through a bit of a hard time and I'm just excited to have met someone so attentive, gentle, and generous with extremely low expectations of me (we've not had sexual conversations at all, at most he said that my height and hair are sexy lol). He seems to want to spoil me simply because he likes to take care of kind hearted people and thinks of me that way, and it doesn't help that he's tall, athletic, smells great, and got a sexy silver fox vibe going on. Feeling like I struck gold so I'm sharing this story in hopes that whoever is reading this will be blessed w secondhand luck from me haha 

Stay safe and stay true to yourselves luvs! xo 

***[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarBABYonlyforum/comments/1dczq0t/how_can_i_navigate_this_situation/) 6/10/24*** in separate post

This is going to sound a bit convoluted and unethical but I need some advice. Tl;dr at the end.

I haven't seen him in a month and during our last date, I performed oral because I was very happy with how our date went but we didn't do anything further than that. Soon after, I got symptoms for an oral STI and I am currently awaiting results for that but the likelihood is high. I did perform oral on other men before/after him (we're not monogamous but we'd rather not know ab each other's romantic/sex life) but the symptoms appeared a few days after I saw him and I didn't see anyone else before/after for at least a week or two.

At first, I didn't know it was an oral STI but now I'm pretty sure it is. I haven't seen him since then because we took turns traveling and I won't see him for another week at least. I really don't want to upset him and ruin our relationship because I really like our relationship and I really need the allowance he provides. I'm unsure if I should:

A) tell him immediately and try to play it off casually (someth like, ""I don't mean to alarm you and I don't want to know if you've been seeing anyone else but I got some strange symptoms in my mouth after we last met and am awaiting test results, I suggest you do too""). Which I'm afraid will make him feel insulted.

or

B) Claim someone took advantage of my mouth at an upcoming event because we were both really inebriated then a few days later, say that my throat came back positive for something so he should get tested just in case (BEFORE I see him again). So the result will come back positive for both of us but he doesn't know that I know it's him.

For context, I did get SA'd in the past right before meeting this SD and he was extremely, extremely sympathetic and upset on my behalf. He tends to be really gentle and caring with me in conversation and in bed and has never been upset with me before. I know faking SA is really shitty but I think my odds of keeping this relationship is higher if I get sympathy out of him instead of anger. He always wears condoms because he doesn't want to compromise his sexual health but I don't think he considered orally transmitted STIs.

Tl;dr: I think my favourite SD gave me an oral STI (fully treatable) and I want to tell him to get treated but I don't want to scare him away or have him dump me, ESPECIALLY before I see him again and get my allowance that I really need.

So I work in a Bookies in what would be a busy enough area that has a lot of undesirables hanging around.

We get a lot of them in the shop, some are known criminals that are constantly in and out of Prison, some for armed robbery, they just come in and hang around drinking free coffee for the day and we're not allowed to say anything, Wouldn't want to anyway due to the abuse you'll receive.

A while back our shop had our shop hours cut due to not being so busy like most bookies these days, this however would see the Rotas being completed with someone closing up on their own of a Friday night or Saturday night when it's busy in the area, then we were short staffed for a while and pretty much every day of the week someone was either opening alone or closing alone, there would never be 2 people there for the the full shift.

Then the most annoying thing is and this constantly happens, someone calls in sick on say a Monday for the week, they'll know that person was due in Friday say with myself, and make no effort whatsoever to replace them, we would send emails looking for this to be filled and we would always be reassured someone will be there with you on the day don't worry, then you arrive to work, no sign of anybody, you get onto them and they back track and tell you they'll get cover from another shop for you to have your 1hr lunch break.

This means you're in that shop alone for 11 hours of the day, making it very hard to have anything to eat or make it to the toilet, I have ongoing issues that require me to be able to use the toilet when I need to, this was relayed to my Regional Manager & I still constantly find myself being forced to work Alone, a lot of the time I have to hold in and sit there in pain just waiting for the shop to empty so I can lock the door and goto the toilet, this could take hours sometimes.

It's not in my contract that I have to work alone but it isn't in it that I don't have to work alone either.

Other staff members as well as myself have sent numerous emails saying we refuse to single man and it gets ignored & ends up happening because they make you feel like you have to or you'll get pulled up on it because if you refuse to open you're losing them money which could cost me my job I guess?

Older members of staff from other shops tell me to refuse and tell them I'm not opening until they get someone in like they do in that situation but these staff members are there 15+ years and have completely different contracts than me & seem to have good relationships with the Regional Managers, they tend to treat some shops better due to these contracts.

There are large sums of money in the shop & this shop has had a few attempted robberies over the years, the last being Christmas 23 as well as it being threatened a few weeks ago.

Basically I just want to know can they make me single man/loan work? If I refuse do they have the right to give me disciplinaries for refusing?

On paper, I’ve been in a good place for the last eight months, really two years. If I had to list things (to remind myself of how good life is): got a new job, have amazing friends I cafe-hop and dress up with, moving to a new family house in two weeks, doing my master’s, somehow get thousands of likes in hours if I download a dating app, I draw, read, write, exercise, take care of my appearance, stay involved in city communities for books, coffee, health, etc., and volunteer and organise events.

I do so much, but this big empty hole in my stomach never goes away. I misplace that feeling. I call it nostalgia for old friends or this specific ex. I turn it into anger at other things, like delays in my master’s. But honestly, it’s all grief from back then, and I cannot separate it from my current happiness. I want advice on life and faith - not the kind tied to churches or temples, but the kind that's deeper and bigger.

For context, I was in a bad relationship years ago, so very severe and triggering. Since then, my tolerance has become extremely low (boundaries that they are). Can't tolerate even mom being pushy or dad hovering. No issue apart from this one thing: I simply pushed away and cut off a different person I dated this year because they raised their voice at me in public. I could not imagine this individual in any other light anymore.  

All of me feels contained in that one course of life. Writhing in bodily pain on the floor, the startled jumps and flinches I get now, curling like a scared baby when I sleep, going into flight or fight when someone repeats the behaviour and the words that person used to say. The hundred ways my body still suffers- migraines, vertigo, trembling hands, ringing ears, dropping things, a hypersensitive nervous system, random knee pains, losing my sense of smell for weeks if I get a cold and so on. I can't see myself as more than the sum of these things.

I’m always staring at the darkness and all of me and my happiness is so much smaller than it.[ This painting](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGZLHJOBVH/) by Paul Wiener perfectly captures it.

I never had eczema issues in my life. Fast forward to age 35 I go see a doc for a possible hemroid situation.  He says he can see some irritation and minor hemroid issues so he focuses on changing my diet. I ask if he could give me something to stop the itching for the time being while I work on my diet. He prescribes a Preperation H cream. I wish I would have just dealt with the itching for a few days because I did well with changing my diet and I'm sure it all would have been fine. Anyway I used the cream and had instant results and use it for about two weeks. Then I noticed a more severe itch a few weeks later then back to the cream. This went on for a few months.  Cream would fix things then it would come  back so I decided to stop using the cream because I remember the pharmacist said not to use it for too long. A few weeks after I stopped, small dry patches appeared on my hands and wrists. I was completely confused. Then the dry skin started working its way up my arms. Then shortly after it's like a woke up one day and had extremely dry eyelids all around my eyes and inside and outside of my ears. Between my buttocks was dry as well as my armpits, etc. I knew immediately that it was some sort of allergic reaction.  I'm a creature of habit. Every day I follow the very similar routine so I knew instantly the only thing that I was doing differently was that i was taking preperation H and had just stopped not long before the madness. I then started researching the medication and realized it had Hydrocortisone 1%. Even once I found that out I had no idea this could be a bad thing until I discovered TSW. Anyway I made an appointment with a couple doctors and both told me I had eczema. It didnt make sense to me. I told myself I was completely normal before the medication so there is no way this can be permanent. So I decided to just let it go away on it's own naturally. I dont know if this was helpful but for a year I showered every other day and took a variety of vitamins and when I did use cream I used b12 cream on the dry skin. I dont know if that helped but it at least masked the dry appearance when I went out. Fast forward to now which total is roughly 2 years. Its basically all gone except the ears! That's the one thing thags very difficult for me to get rid of! I have been using zinc cream and that seems to get rid of the itch but looks terrible. I use a tiny amount of Ketoconazole cream when I need to go out in public. I noticed most folks on here that say they have TSW had some sort of eczema background.  Just wanted to share this for all the people that never dealt with dry skin issues and took hydrocortisone either by accident or for some other issue. Just wanted to let them know I think limiting showers, vitamins for skin and immune system as well and eating healthy seem to have helped me. Also I noticed Coffee and processed sugar or just any kind of sweets in general made my skin go crazy. Thanks for listening",0,1744789709.0,eczema,0,0.5,False
1k0evd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1k0evd7/why_are_my_teeth_so_yellow/,Why are my teeth so yellow?,"If you’ve ever looked in the mirror and wondered, **“Why are my teeth so yellow?”**, you’re not alone. I used to think yellow teeth were just from poor hygiene, but after doing some research (and testing different whitening methods), I realized that’s **only part of the story**.

So if you brush and floss daily but your teeth still aren’t white, what’s going on? Let’s break down the **real reasons behind yellow teeth**—and the best ways to fix it.

# Main Causes of Yellow Teeth

1. **Stains from Food & Drinks**
   * Coffee, tea, red wine, and dark sodas are **some of the worst culprits** for staining teeth.
   * Acidic drinks (like soda and citrus juices) **weaken enamel**, making stains more noticeable.
   * Even some healthy foods—like berries and soy sauce—can cause discoloration over time.
2. **Smoking & Tobacco Use**
   * Nicotine and tar stain teeth **quickly and deeply**, making them turn yellow or even brown.
   * No amount of regular brushing will completely remove deep tobacco stains.
3. **Aging & Thinning Enamel**
   * As we age, **tooth enamel wears down**, revealing more of the dentin underneath (which has a naturally yellow color).
   * This means even if you have great hygiene, your teeth can still appear yellow over time.
4. **Genetics & Natural Tooth Color**
   * Some people are just **born with slightly darker or more yellowish teeth**—it’s completely normal.
   * If your parents had naturally whiter teeth, you’re more likely to have them too.
5. **Poor Oral Hygiene**
   * Brushing and flossing are essential, but they **don’t remove deep-set stains**.
   * If plaque builds up, it can trap stains and bacteria, making teeth look even more discolored.
6. **Certain Medications & Health Conditions**
   * Some antibiotics (like tetracycline) and medical treatments can **cause tooth discoloration** as a side effect.
   * Chemotherapy and radiation can also affect tooth color.

# How to Fix Yellow Teeth (What Actually Works?)

If you’ve got yellow teeth, don’t worry—there are several **proven ways to whiten them**. Here’s what works (and what doesn’t).

✔ **Whitening Toothpaste** – Helps with surface stains but **won’t change deep discoloration**.  
✔ **Whitening Strips** – Can work but often **cause sensitivity** and take weeks to see results.  
✔ **Professional Whitening at the Dentist** – Very effective, but also **expensive ($500+ per session)**.  
✔ **LED Whitening Kits** – A great at-home option that combines **hydrogen peroxide gel + LED light** to speed up results.

I tested **Laughland teeth whitening**, which is an **LED whitening kit**, and it worked **way faster than strips or toothpaste alone**. By day 7, my teeth were about **6 shades whiter**, and I didn’t experience any sensitivity.

**Want to check out how LED whitening works? More details** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# What to Avoid When Trying to Whiten Teeth

🚫 **Charcoal Toothpaste** – Abrasive and can **damage enamel**, making teeth more yellow over time.  
🚫 **Lemon & Baking Soda DIY Methods** – Highly acidic and **erodes enamel**, causing long-term damage.  
🚫 **Overusing Whitening Strips** – Can **weaken enamel** and make teeth sensitive if used too often.

If you want something **safe and effective**, LED whitening kits (like **Laughland teeth whitening**) use a **dentist-formulated peroxide gel** without causing sensitivity or enamel damage. I saw results in **just a few days**, which was faster than any other method I tried.

# Final Thoughts – Can You Get Rid of Yellow Teeth?

**Yes!** Yellow teeth **can be whitened**, but the best method depends on the cause. **If it’s surface stains**, whitening toothpaste or strips might help. **If it’s deep discoloration**, LED whitening kits or professional treatments will work better.

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening was the easiest and fastest way** to brighten my smile without pain or sensitivity. If you’ve struggled with yellow teeth, what’s worked (or not worked) for you? Let’s talk in the comments!",1,1744789589.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

A taste of sun-warmed tomatoes, a sea breeze tangled in your hair, a rhythm that slows your pulse and awakens your senses. But beyond the food, the views, and the Instagram reels, there’s a deeper pull — a way of seeing, feeling, and living that we call the Mediterranean state of mind.

So what exactly does it mean? It’s not just about location — it’s a philosophy, a lifestyle, and for many, a quiet longing to belong to something timeless.

# Let’s dive in.

# A Rhythm That Respects the Day

In the Mediterranean, time bends. It doesn’t rush — it meanders.  
A Rhythm That Respects the Dayhttps://www.inlovewiththemed.com/mediterranean-state-of-mind/

In the Mediterranean, time bends. It doesn’t rush — it meanders.

You notice it in the slow sip of a morning coffee, enjoyed not in a paper cup on a commute, but in a ceramic mug overlooking a lemon grove. You feel it in the long lunches that become dinners. You see it in the unapologetic midday closures of shops in the blazing August heat — because life happens, and it happens slowly.

The Mediterranean state of mind **honors the moment**. It resists the cult of productivity and celebrates presence. Here, slowness is not laziness. It’s wisdom.

# The Art of Savoring

Mediterranean cuisine is the poster child of global wellness — olive oil, fresh vegetables, grilled fish. But its true power lies not just in what’s on the plate, but how it’s enjoyed.

Food is ritual. A shared dish is a shared story. Meals stretch for hours, not because of ten courses, but because of conversation, laughter, and the subtle joy of passing the bread to your neighbor.

To live in a Mediterranean state of mind is to **savor life** — not just meals, but walks, glances, breezes, silences.

But I can’t keep pretending.

I was 12 He was 19. And his name was Dean Withers.

Yes—that Dean Withers. The political “prodigy,” the guy everyone thinks is so smart and articulate and ahead of his time. The one on podcasts talking about consent and boundaries and “the responsibility of men in leadership.” The guy with thousands of followers hanging on his every word.

He wasn’t famous when I met him, but he was someone. People in the political youth space knew who he was. He was already doing panels, getting attention for being “the next big thing.” I was in high school, trying to get involved in activism. I followed him online, asked a question on one of his livestreams, and a few hours later, I got a DM.

At first, I couldn’t believe it. Dean Withers messaging me. He said he liked how I thought. That I was “sharp for my age.” That I had potential. We talked about politics and books and social movements. I felt seen in a way I hadn’t before.

Then it got more personal.

He started asking questions that didn’t feel so much like mentoring anymore. About my relationships. About if I’d ever dated older guys. He’d compliment me—say I was “way more mature than most girls” he knew. It made me feel special. Like I had something other girls didn’t. Like I was smarter, more grounded, more… desirable.

That’s how grooming works. It’s slow. It’s careful. It’s wrapped in flattery and attention and “you’re not like the others.”

After a few weeks of talking almost every day, he asked if I wanted to meet up. Said he was coming to my city for an event. I didn’t think anything of it—he framed it like a mentorship thing. “I just want to help you figure out where you fit in this movement,” he said.

I remember stressing about what to wear. Not wanting to look too young.

We met up at a bookstore café. He bought me coffee. Said I was “even prettier in person.” I blushed. I was awkward. He laughed it off and made me feel okay. He asked about school, family, what I wanted to do after graduation. He said he wished he’d met someone like me when he was 12.

It didn’t feel dangerous. Not yet.

Afterward, he said he had a little time before his next meeting, asked if I wanted to keep talking at his hotel. I hesitated. But I told myself I was being paranoid. He’s not some creep, I thought. He’s Dean Withers. He talks about feminism and accountability and respect.

So I went.

His room was clean, organized, nothing sketchy. We sat on the bed and talked. But something shifted. He started touching my arm when he laughed. Then my leg. I stiffened. He leaned in and kissed me.

I didn’t kiss him back.

He pulled away for a second and smiled, said, “You’re nervous. That’s cute.” He kissed me again, harder. His hands moved fast. I froze. I remember saying, “Wait,” and “I’m not ready,” and “I don’t know.”

He didn’t stop.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t fight him. I went quiet. I went still. That’s what I hate the most—I didn’t know how to make him stop. I thought maybe if I didn’t move, he’d finish faster. I was scared if I pushed him, he’d get angry. I didn’t want to be “dramatic.” I just wanted it to end.

When it was over, I got dressed in the bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time. My face looked… blank. I didn’t cry until I got home.

The next day, he messaged me like nothing had happened. Told me he had a great time. Said I was “incredible.” I wanted to scream.

But instead, I said “Thanks.” I tried to make it make sense in my head. Maybe it wasn’t that bad. Maybe I led him on. Maybe it was my fault for going to his room.

I was 12.

He knew that. I told him.

And still, he didn’t care.

Now, months later, I see him blowing up online. Interviews. Speaking engagements. People calling him “a voice of his generation.” And I think about that girl who thought she was mature enough to handle anything. Who thought being quiet was the safest way to survive.

And I can’t keep quiet anymore.

What happened in that hotel room wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t confusion. It wasn’t a bad date. It was assault. And I’ve carried that for years while watching him rise.",0,1744788355.0,ParkerGetAJob,11,0.4,False
1k0el0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/sekurenet/comments/1k0el0p/automating_cyber_threat_intelligence_whats/,"Automating Cyber Threat Intelligence: What’s Working, What’s Not, and Where We’re Headed","There’s a saying in cybersecurity: *“It’s not if, but when.”* That alone should tell us why reactive defenses no longer cut it. As threat actors grow more persistent and sophisticated, organizations need to anticipate attacks—not just respond to them.

That’s where Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) steps in. And more recently, CTI automation has become a game-changer. Think fewer repetitive tasks, faster detection, and decisions based on actual context—not guesswork.

So, Why Automate CTI in the First Place?

Manual CTI workflows are draining. Imagine combing through logs, feeds, and alerts every single day to find the *one* thing that matters. Now multiply that by ten if you’re handling multiple clients or complex environments.

With automation in the picture:

* Threats get flagged quicker
* Analysts aren’t bogged down with redundant tasks
* You gain consistent, reliable intelligence—across the board

Techniques That Actually Work in the Field

1. Automated Threat Feed Ingestion

You can't defend what you don't see. Most orgs pull intel from sources like OSINT, commercial feeds, and sharing groups like ISACs. But these come in different formats, which makes correlation a pain.

Automation solves that. With the help of platforms like *MISP* or *OpenCTI*, threat feeds are normalized into a readable, unified format.

2. IOC Correlation at Scale

Indicators of Compromise (IP addresses, hashes, domains, etc.) only help if they’re mapped against your own environment. Automating this correlation lets you spot malicious activity before it becomes a headline.

Pairing this with tools like *TheHive + Cortex* or *Splunk* means you can jump from detection to action in minutes, not hours.

3. Prioritization Based on Context

Every alert is not a crisis—and automation can help tell the difference. CTI tools can assign risk scores based on severity, frequency, and known associations. Many teams map this to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which adds context that’s often missing in raw alerts.

4. Text Analysis Using NLP

This one’s underrated: scraping blogs, threat reports, or dark web forums for mentions of new CVEs or malware strains. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can extract that info and feed it straight into your detection logic.

It’s like having someone monitoring hacker chatter 24/7—without needing coffee breaks.

5. SOAR-Based Playbooks

This is where it all comes together. SOAR tools like *Cortex XSOAR* or *Splunk Phantom* let you build playbooks that respond automatically to threats:

* Block IPs in firewalls
* Isolate compromised devices
* Pull related logs for analysis

When done right, you’ve got response times in seconds—not hours.

6. ML-Based Threat Detection

Machine learning can identify behavioral patterns that fall outside the norm. It’s especially helpful for spotting stealthy threats that don’t match known IOCs.

But It’s Not All Smooth Sailing

Let’s be real—CTI automation isn’t plug-and-play.

* False positives can still sneak through if rules aren’t fine-tuned.
* Too many feeds? Without filtering, it’s just noise.
* And not all tools “talk” to each other, which means you’re back to stitching dashboards.

Also: no matter how automated your pipeline is, human review is still crucial. Automation gives you speed. Humans bring insight.

What’s Next?

CTI automation isn’t about adding more tools. It’s about making better use of the ones you already have.

The sweet spot lies in:

* Streamlining the flow from intel → detection → response
* Aligning CTI with your actual risk profile
* And building workflows your analysts will actually use

If your current setup still feels manual and reactive, it might be time to rethink your CTI strategy!",1,1744788322.0,sekurenet,0,1.0,False
1k0eka9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALawyer/comments/1k0eka9/neighbor_slanders_me_moved_his_camera_to_record/,"neighbor slanders me, moved his camera to record me coming & going from the house","hello, first and foremost, sorry for the format. this is going to be long, I'm going to do my best to explain the issue, and I'll break it up so it's not a wall of text. if you read the whole thing, I love you and I hope your pillow is always cool & every coffee you order is perfect. there is a tl;dr at the bottom if you really don't wanna read.

this will likely read as some white trash bullsh*t. I am aware that there are unsavory things about my living situation, but my rent is $300/month, I can pay it how I need to, and I'm unemployed right now so I can't afford much more nor can I afford to move. I got out of a dangerous DV relationship prior to living here, I had to start over from scratch with literally everything. home, career, vehicle, etc. okay, here goes.

I rent a room from a woman and her mother (the homeowner.) they have ""issues"" to say the least, but that's a whole separate post on it's own. I am a former addict in recovery, which those inside this house know that but no one outside this house should know, and the daughter of the homeowner here is a current addict (everyone in the neighborhood, businesses in the area, and damn near the whole city know she is.) her biggest issue is lying a lot. 

sometimes when she has strangers she just met in and out of the house, I won't sleep here. it makes me feel unsafe. I will sleep in the car parked somewhere, or i park on the street a little ways down the road. a few months back a member of the neighborhood that doesn't *know* me, but knows I live in the neighborhood called 911 and said I was ""dead in my car from an overdose"" which I was not. EMS and police arrived. they woke me up, I told the police what I was doing and why I was sleeping in the car. they told me it was no problem as long as the car wasn't running & the keys were out of the ignition. I was not arrested, fined, nor was I brought to a hospital or even checked out by EMS. the man that had called came out and spoke with the responders, but did not speak to me. 

fast forward a few weeks, same thing - roommate has strangers in the house, they're high, etc, I sleep in the car but this time on the street across from my house. there is no house across from me. no police involvement. my direct neighbor then came over to my house the next day and started screaming at the mother and daughter that I was in my car, passed out on drugs and he knows that because neighbor down the street told him I overdosed outside of his house in my car, blah blah. which again - not what happened, as I've already explained. it's literally factually incorrect and at this point it's feeling like slander.

anytime they have a problem with him, he brings this up and goes on and on about me being a ""junkie who ODs everywhere."" he's getting a pool installed, they had to take the privacy fence down to cut out a tree and it's roots, and when they put it back up, the panels are upside down, sagging and almost falling, and open holes everywhere that the dog here can fit through and escape, and he tried to tell the two women here they are responsible for half of the cost to now repair it. one panel of his fell down one day and I was in the garage and I turned around and was greeted by his two massive full blood pitbulls. they were friendly, and I have no issues with dogs, but they don't know me? what if they took issue with me? when they said something about the fence, he started going off about me again.

our houses are side by side with a likely 5 foot privacy fence in between; I'm 5'10 and can easily see over it from a distance and close up. houses are close enough I could spit on his. we use the garage to enter and exit the house; either the big garage door or the regular door on the side. the side door opens and you're facing HIS side door for his garage, privacy fence in between. I noticed after the situation, he moved his camera that he had at his side door. it used to point down at the walkway in front of his side door, and he lifted it so it's pointing straight ahead at our side door. I know it for a fact, as now when I come in and out my side door, the blue motion detecting light on his camera comes on and starts recording & it never used to when he had it pointed to his own property/walkway like it should be. 

is there legal recourse for any of this? the camera being pointed at our door? him continuing to reference overdose(s) that didn't even happen, and all of that? I thought about a cease and desist in the mailbox of direct neighbor and the neighbor guy down the street who told him all of this, but I can't afford that.

as stated, I am in recovery. I don't use drugs anymore, I go to a clinic, and I get random drug tests done weekly. so I am definitely not on drugs. but this shit is getting old, and I don't like my whereabouts and me being watched coming and going from my own house & it being recorded by someone else from a different property that historically has been slandering me.

*TL;DR - my neighbor down the street is telling people in the neighborhood, including my direct neighbor, that I'm a drug addict who ""overdoses everywhere"" which is factually incorrect, and now my neighbors camera above his side door is pointed directly at my side door and records me coming and going from the house.* ",2,1744788236.0,AskALawyer,3,1.0,False

**What Is ""Alan Weiss - Common Sense Consulting (Week 1-50)"" All About?**

Alright, let’s break it down. *Alan Weiss - Common Sense Consulting (Week 1-50)* is basically like having a consulting Jedi send you a mini-masterclass every single week for a year. No fluff. No upsell. No hidden modules. Just one new strategy, tip, or framework delivered via video—straight from the legendary Alan Weiss himself. Think of it like a Netflix series, but instead of bingeing, you *grow your business*. One powerful tip at a time.

**Who Should Be Checking This Out?**

If you’re in the consulting game—newbie, seasoned pro, or even just flirting with the idea—this is *for you*. Alan’s style is straight-talking, no-nonsense, and all about **value-per-minute**. You don’t need an MBA. You don’t need to be a millionaire. You just need the willingness to apply what he gives you.

Veterans will find ways to *fine-tune* their craft and raise fees with confidence. Newbies will skip the trial-and-error phase (and probably avoid some serious facepalms). Bottom line? If you trade in advice for money, this will make your advice more valuable.

**Where Does It All Happen?**

Wherever you are, honestly. The beauty of the *Alan Weiss - Common Sense Consulting (Week 1-50)* series is it’s totally digital. You’ll get these juicy five-minute videos in your inbox every week. Watch them on your phone. Your tablet. Your laptop while sipping overpriced coffee. Doesn’t matter. These tips go wherever you go.

And Alan even throws in graphics, documents, or even (jokingly?) tattoos if needed to explain the method. So you’re not just listening—you’re *learning* and *implementing*.

**When Does It Start and How Long Does It Run?**

It kicks off on Labor Day week—pretty fitting for something that helps you *work smarter, not harder*. And then it runs for **50 straight weeks**. One new concept per week, so you’re not overwhelmed. It's a slow drip of high-grade consulting wisdom that actually sticks.

Think of it as your Monday morning booster shot of clarity, confidence, and cash-flow ideas.

**Why Is This Worth It? (Seriously, Just $5 a Week?)**

Here’s the crazy part: the whole thing costs $250. That’s *$5 a week*. You probably drop more on snacks you don’t remember eating. But each week you’re getting something that can literally tweak your pitch, shift your value prop, or cut your client workload in half.

It’s not motivational fluff. It’s not theory. It’s straight-up tactics you can apply *immediately*. That’s the kind of ROI you won’t find in most courses—especially not at this price.

**How Does It Actually Work?**

Simple. You pay once. Then for 50 weeks, you receive a video. In it, Alan breaks down a specific technique that can level up your consulting practice. Topics range from pricing, positioning, client acquisition, time management—you name it.

The real charm? These videos are short and tight—around 5 minutes. Alan knows your time is valuable, so he gets right to the point. You can watch, understand, and implement in less time than it takes to scroll through your inbox.

**Final Thoughts**

*Alan Weiss - Common Sense Consulting (Week 1-50)* is proof that big transformations don’t need to come from big, expensive programs. Sometimes all it takes is a weekly nugget of brilliance from someone who’s *been there, done that,* and is kind enough to pass the playbook on.

Whether you’re just starting or looking to scale smarter, this series is like a pocket-sized mentor that whispers “you got this” once a week—with actual instructions on what to do next.",1,1744787702.0,MaisieStudying,1,1.0,False

# 🚫 THE PROBLEM: Exhaustion, Fog, and Hopelessness

Just six months ago, I was *barely functioning*.

I’m 44 years old—not ancient, but not in my twenties anymore either. I work full-time, take care of two kids, and try to juggle everything life throws at me. Somewhere in the past few years, I started noticing a decline. I wasn’t just “tired”—I was constantly exhausted. My mind felt foggy. My motivation was gone. I’d sleep for eight hours and wake up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all.

Doctors told me everything looked “fine.” Bloodwork normal. Nothing clinical.

But I didn’t *feel* fine.

I was losing interest in everything—work, hobbies, even family time. I wasn’t depressed in the traditional sense, but I was slipping into a version of myself I didn’t recognize. Something deeper was off.

I tried coffee, energy drinks, vitamins, diets—nothing worked.

That’s when I came across **MITOLYN**.

# 🔍 DISCOVERING MITOLYN: A Hidden Gem in the Wellness World

I found MITOLYN in a biohacking forum, where someone mentioned it as a “game-changing mitochondrial support formula.” I had no idea what that meant at the time, but I started researching.

Turns out, MITOLYN is formulated to support **mitochondria**—the tiny powerhouses in our cells that produce energy. As we age, our mitochondria become less efficient, which leads to fatigue, mental fog, and a host of other symptoms most people chalk up to “getting older.”

But MITOLYN doesn’t just give you a temporary boost. It’s designed to **restore energy at the cellular level**. It’s packed with ingredients like CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, PQQ, and bio-optimized antioxidants—each one clinically backed and carefully dosed.

What impressed me even more was that MITOLYN had **no cheap fillers**, **no artificial junk**, and **transparent labeling**. Every capsule had a purpose.

I decided to give it a try. I figured I had nothing to lose.

# ✅ WEEK 1: Subtle Shifts I Couldn’t Deny

The first few days were… surprisingly hopeful.

I didn’t feel a jolt of energy like I’d downed a triple espresso. But I *did* feel like my brain had cleared a bit. I was finishing emails faster. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons.

By Day 5, I noticed something else—I was smiling more. I was less irritable with my kids.

That’s when I realized MITOLYN wasn’t just helping me feel “awake.” It was helping me feel **alive**.

# ✅ WEEK 2–4: A Transformation in Real-Time

By the third week, my energy levels were *off the charts*. I wasn’t jittery or wired—I was just *consistently on*.

My workouts, which I had nearly given up on, became enjoyable again. I was lifting more, running farther, and waking up the next day feeling *recovered*, not wrecked.

Mentally, I was sharper than I’d been in years. I was writing faster, solving problems quicker, and remembering things effortlessly. My friends and coworkers even started commenting:

>

I smiled and said one word: “**MITOLYN**.”

# ❤️ THE EMOTIONAL SIDE: Getting Me Back

It’s easy to talk about improved energy, better sleep, or mental clarity. But what MITOLYN gave me goes beyond that.

It gave me **myself** back.

I laugh more. I’m more patient with my children. I look forward to my mornings. I have energy in the evenings for hobbies, not just survival. My passion for life has returned.

You don’t realize how much being tired all the time takes away from you—until you’re not tired anymore.

# 🧬 THE SCIENCE IS LEGIT

MITOLYN isn’t just some trendy supplement with a fancy label. The science behind it is solid.

Every ingredient has a purpose:

* **CoQ10**: Crucial for ATP production, powering every cell in your body.
* **NAD+ Precursors (like NMN or NR)**: Help reverse mitochondrial aging.
* **PQQ**: Promotes the growth of *new* mitochondria—literally regenerating your energy engines.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**: Supports brain and nerve health.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**: A master antioxidant, great for reducing inflammation.

These ingredients aren’t just thrown together—they’re dosed based on actual research. MITOLYN clearly invested in **real formulation**—not hype.

# 💯 VALUE FOR MONEY: Worth Every Cent

Yes, MITOLYN isn’t the cheapest supplement out there. But I learned the hard way that *cheap doesn’t mean effective*.

When I calculated how much I was spending on energy drinks, multivitamins, snacks to stay awake, and missed productivity—it was clear: MITOLYN actually saved me money.

Plus, the quality is pharmaceutical-grade. You *feel* the difference.

# ⭐ FINAL THOUGHTS: A 1000-Star Product

If I could give MITOLYN more than 5 stars, I would.

This isn’t just a supplement—it’s a **life enhancer**.

Whether you’re a burnt-out parent, an overworked professional, or someone who just wants to feel better again, **MITOLYN is the answer** you didn’t know existed.

I’ve recommended it to friends, family, coworkers—and now I’m recommending it to you.

**Don’t wait.**  
Don’t let another week of fog, fatigue, and frustration go by.

But MITOLYN doesn’t just give you a temporary boost. It’s designed to **restore energy at the cellular level**. It’s packed with ingredients like CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, PQQ, and bio-optimized antioxidants—each one clinically backed and carefully dosed.

What impressed me even more was that MITOLYN had **no cheap fillers**, **no artificial junk**, and **transparent labeling**. Every capsule had a purpose.

I decided to give it a try. I figured I had nothing to lose.

# ✅ WEEK 1: Subtle Shifts I Couldn’t Deny

The first few days were… surprisingly hopeful.

I didn’t feel a jolt of energy like I’d downed a triple espresso. But I *did* feel like my brain had cleared a bit. I was finishing emails faster. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons.

By Day 5, I noticed something else—I was smiling more. I was less irritable with my kids.

That’s when I realized MITOLYN wasn’t just helping me feel “awake.” It was helping me feel **alive**.

# ✅ WEEK 2–4: A Transformation in Real-Time

By the third week, my energy levels were *off the charts*. I wasn’t jittery or wired—I was just *consistently on*.

My workouts, which I had nearly given up on, became enjoyable again. I was lifting more, running farther, and waking up the next day feeling *recovered*, not wrecked.

Mentally, I was sharper than I’d been in years. I was writing faster, solving problems quicker, and remembering things effortlessly. My friends and coworkers even started commenting:

>

I smiled and said one word: “**MITOLYN**.”

# ❤️ THE EMOTIONAL SIDE: Getting Me Back

It’s easy to talk about improved energy, better sleep, or mental clarity. But what MITOLYN gave me goes beyond that.

It gave me **myself** back.

I laugh more. I’m more patient with my children. I look forward to my mornings. I have energy in the evenings for hobbies, not just survival. My passion for life has returned.

You don’t realize how much being tired all the time takes away from you—until you’re not tired anymore.

# 🧬 THE SCIENCE IS LEGIT

MITOLYN isn’t just some trendy supplement with a fancy label. The science behind it is solid.

Every ingredient has a purpose:

* **CoQ10**: Crucial for ATP production, powering every cell in your body.
* **NAD+ Precursors (like NMN or NR)**: Help reverse mitochondrial aging.
* **PQQ**: Promotes the growth of *new* mitochondria—literally regenerating your energy engines.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**: Supports brain and nerve health.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**: A master antioxidant, great for reducing inflammation.

These ingredients aren’t just thrown together—they’re dosed based on actual research. MITOLYN clearly invested in **real formulation**—not hype.

# 💯 VALUE FOR MONEY: Worth Every Cent

Yes, MITOLYN isn’t the cheapest supplement out there. But I learned the hard way that *cheap doesn’t mean effective*.

When I calculated how much I was spending on energy drinks, multivitamins, snacks to stay awake, and missed productivity—it was clear: MITOLYN actually saved me money.

Plus, the quality is pharmaceutical-grade. You *feel* the difference.

# ⭐ FINAL THOUGHTS: A 1000-Star Product

If I could give MITOLYN more than 5 stars, I would.

This isn’t just a supplement—it’s a **life enhancer**.

Whether you’re a burnt-out parent, an overworked professional, or someone who just wants to feel better again, **MITOLYN is the answer** you didn’t know existed.

I’ve recommended it to friends, family, coworkers—and now I’m recommending it to you.

**Don’t wait.**  
Don’t let another week of fog, fatigue, and frustration go by.  
**Buy MITOLYN.** Experience the transformation.  
Get your life back—because you deserve to *feel amazing*.

# 🚫 THE PROBLEM: Exhaustion, Fog, and Hopelessness

Just six months ago, I was *barely functioning*.

I’m 44 years old—not ancient, but not in my twenties anymore either. I work full-time, take care of two kids, and try to juggle everything life throws at me. Somewhere in the past few years, I started noticing a decline. I wasn’t just “tired”—I was constantly exhausted. My mind felt foggy. My motivation was gone. I’d sleep for eight hours and wake up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all.

Doctors told me everything looked “fine.” Bloodwork normal. Nothing clinical.

But I didn’t *feel* fine.

I was losing interest in everything—work, hobbies, even family time. I wasn’t depressed in the traditional sense, but I was slipping into a version of myself I didn’t recognize. Something deeper was off.

I tried coffee, energy drinks, vitamins, diets—nothing worked.

That’s when I came across **MITOLYN**.

I would be ok meeting him for one last time but how do I proceed?","I was dating this man last year, he ended things basically saying I'm too young and not settled in life yet and he is stable and if I ever have to move to another state for grad school he wouldn't move with me, asked if I would change my career paths for him etc etc. I said ok I understand and we broke up. He texted me after a few months, we started having casual sex - no dates, nothing - which worked fine for me as I was applying to graduate school and wasn't open to dating anyone. 

After I got into graduate school, he escalated things, became lovey dovey, asked me out to dinner but delayed planning it. I was no longer interested in a casual dynamic and wanted to date new men seriously so I ended things with him with a very respectful message, basically saying ""I don't enjoy our dynamic anymore so I don't see a reason to keep things going and no hard feelings"" he gave a neutral response saying ""Ok if that's how you feel. Best of luck""

I moved on. A month later, he texted me yesterday saying he was thinking about me, asking me how I am doing. Then said he was ""thinking that how we were before probably wasn't the best but maybe it would be good to catch up over coffee sometime just see how that goes, nothing sexual""

Although I would be ok meeting up with him, I have absolutely no desire to be involved in sort of casual or serious dating situation with this person, especially after dating new men who are better matches for me. I am wondering how I should proceed with this meeting? Do I let him do all the talking? (I just want this to be a short last confrontational meeting)

1k0ea76,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1k0ea76/what_canshould_i_do/,What can/should I do?,"Hi managers,

I recently started a new job a few months ago and have been working under a dotted-line manager, and I have been experiencing interpersonal issues with them. For the first month or so, my manager would have good and bad days throughout the week, but during their bad days it would feel like they would take it out on me - snapping at me out of frustration, showing obvious signs of irritation when I would talk to them, and getting up and walking away after when I ask a question. Making them not very approachable, when they're supposed to be my mentor also, so I usually ask my other coworkers if I have questions. It started to get to a point where I began documenting the incidents with dates and what had happened (about 8 incidents so far). I tried being proactive and asking my manager their expectations and preferred method of communication, and would try my best to stay on their good side. Even then on the third month of me being here, I probably experience them displaying irratation and frustration towards me about once a week now. Seeing their interaction with other coworkers, they seem fine and normal, and it feels like when I talk to them they have a chip on their shoulder - I'm thinking maybe it's because I'm the only person that works under them. My manager has had a couple of days where they have taken me out for coffee and lunch, but the bad days feels like it outweighs the good days - it has been slowly impacting my mental health where I have gone home stressed and upset, and even had a couple weekends where I have felt that way too. It has even made me question if I'm in the right career field as well. I have considered in telling their (and my) boss, our CEO, just so they are aware of the incidents - I wouldn't want them to do anything (yet), and maybe see if they could provide some input or guidance on the situation. I guess the risk, and my biggest worry is the ""what if"" it makes the situation worst, and tarnishes whatever relationship I have with my manager. I do feel like I'm a good worker, and have a good reputation from previous managers I worked with before. I do enjoy the other people at our company, but because it's just me and my manager on one team, they do make an impact on my regular work life. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

### Enhancing Outdoor Living with Covered Outdoor Kitchen Structures

Creating a functional and inviting outdoor kitchen is a fantastic way to extend your living space while enjoying fresh air and natural surroundings. Adding a cover to your outdoor kitchen not only elevates its aesthetic appeal but also brings several practical advantages that enhance comfort and usability throughout the year. Covered outdoor kitchen structures protect your cooking area from the elements, allowing you to entertain guests or enjoy family meals regardless of weather conditions.

### Practical Benefits of Covered Outdoor Kitchen Structures

One of the most compelling reasons to invest in a covered outdoor kitchen is the year-round usability it offers. With protection from sun, rain, and wind, you can cook and dine outside comfortably without worrying about sudden weather changes. This sheltered space reduces the wear and tear on your appliances and furniture, extending their lifespan and maintaining a fresh, clean look over time.

Another important advantage is the control over temperature. A well-designed cover provides shade that lowers the ambient temperature during hot summer days, preventing overheating while cooking and ensuring a pleasant environment for everyone. Additionally, the covered area can accommodate lighting fixtures and fans, improving functionality and comfort throughout evening gatherings.

### Design Ideas to Maximize Function and Style

When planning a covered outdoor kitchen structure, prioritizing usability while expressing your personal style can create a stunning focal point in your backyard. Consider these design ideas to inspire your project:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/covered-outdoor-kitchen-structures  
  
- **Roof Options:** Choose from pergolas, solid roofs, or retractable awnings depending on your climate and preference. A solid roof offers complete protection, while a pergola can balance coverage with an open-air feel.
- **Materials Matter:** Durable, weather-resistant materials like metal, cedar, or composite decking make excellent choices for framing and covering your kitchen. Pair these with stone or brick countertops to create a cohesive and sturdy structure.
- **Built-in Appliances and Storage:** Incorporate built-in grills, smokers, and refrigerators alongside cleverly designed storage compartments to keep your outdoor kitchen organized. Accessibility and ease of maintenance should guide the layout.
- **Lighting and Electrical Outlets:** Proper lighting enhances safety and ambiance, especially for evening cooking and dining. Strategically placed electrical outlets provide convenience for appliances and entertainment systems.
- **Seating and Dining Areas:** Design adjacent covered seating spaces where family and guests can comfortably gather, protected from the weather. Choose weatherproof furniture that complements the overall style.

### Adding Comfort Through Covered Spaces

A covered outdoor kitchen structure allows you to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Integrated ceiling fans can improve air circulation and reduce heat, while retractable screens or curtains protect against insects and add privacy. Using weather-resistant fabrics and cushions increases comfort and ensures your seating area stays vibrant and usable for seasons to come.

### Boosting Property Value and Outdoor Appeal

Investing in a covered outdoor kitchen is more than just creating an enjoyable space; it also adds significant value to your home. Potential buyers often see outdoor kitchens as a luxury feature that enhances lifestyle without the need for extensive landscaping or interior remodeling. A visually appealing and well-thought-out structure can set your property apart in the real estate market.

### Weatherproofing for Longevity

One critical factor in maintaining a covered outdoor kitchen is weatherproofing. Use water-resistant sealants on wood surfaces and choose stainless steel appliances to avoid rust and corrosion. Ensuring proper drainage and selecting materials that withstand UV exposure will keep your kitchen looking fresh and functioning perfectly for years.

### Customizing Your Covered Outdoor Kitchen

A covered outdoor kitchen structure should reflect your preferences and meet your lifestyle needs. Whether you prefer a rustic, farmhouse vibe with natural wood and stone or a sleek, modern look with clean lines and stainless steel, customization is key. Adding personal touches like built-in herb gardens, accent lighting, or a fireplace can turn your space into a unique outdoor retreat.

### Final Tips for Planning Your Covered Outdoor Kitchen

- Assess your available space to determine the size and shape of the structure.
- Consider local building codes and any necessary permits before starting construction.
- Work with professionals who specialize in outdoor kitchens to ensure quality and functionality.
- Plan for proper ventilation, especially if your cooking appliances produce smoke or heat.
- Incorporate sustainable materials and energy-efficient appliances to create an eco-friendly outdoor kitchen.

By thoughtfully designing your covered outdoor kitchen structure, you enhance outdoor living, protect your investment, and create a welcoming place for memories to form. Whether it’s weekend barbecues, quiet mornings with coffee, or festive family dinners, this outdoor haven becomes a cherished extension of your home.

Choosing Materials and Maintenance Tips for Durable Outdoor Kitchen Covers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

<section>### Durability Starts with the Right Material Choice

When you’re investing in covered outdoor kitchen structures, selecting the best materials for your kitchen cover is critical. A durable outdoor kitchen cover doesn’t just protect your cooking area from the elements but also enhances the look and functionality of your space. You want materials that resist weather, maintain their appearance over time, and require minimal upkeep.

### Popular Materials for Outdoor Kitchen Covers

Many materials are available for outdoor kitchen covers, each offering a mix of durability, aesthetics, and maintenance demands. Here are some leading options:

- **Aluminum:** Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and easy to clean, aluminum is a popular choice. It withstands rain, sun, and wind without rusting or warping. Aluminum outdoor kitchen covers often have powder-coated finishes that add an extra layer of protection and color options.
- **Stainless Steel:** Known for its strength and modern look, stainless steel resists rust and stains. It’s slim and sleek, fitting well with contemporary outdoor kitchens. However, it requires periodic cleaning to prevent water spots and fingerprints.
- **Marine-Grade Vinyl:** For those who want flexibility combined with protection, marine-grade vinyl covers are waterproof and UV-resistant. They shield your kitchen appliances effectively and are available in a variety of colors. These covers are often cushioned, which helps prevent dents and scratches.
- **Canvas and Fabric:** Heavy-duty outdoor fabrics treated with waterproof coatings are another choice. They allow for breathability, reducing mold and mildew issues, but generally need more regular cleaning and treatment to maintain water resistance.
 
### Additional Features to Boost Longevity

The material alone isn’t the only factor in durability—features like UV resistance, water repellency, and reinforcement in stitching play key roles in how long your cover lasts. Look for materials with built-in UV blockers to prevent fading and degradation from sun exposure. Seam reinforcement and double stitching can also increase resistance against tears and wind damage.

### Maintenance Tips for Long-Lasting Outdoor Kitchen Covers

Proper maintenance maximizes the lifespan of your outdoor kitchen cover. Regular care helps you avoid unsightly stains, mold buildup, and physical damage. Here are practical tips to keep your cover in great shape year-round:

- **Keep It Clean:** Wipe down covers regularly with mild soap and water to remove dirt, dust, and debris. For stubborn stains, use a soft brush and avoid abrasive cleaners that might damage the surface.
- **Dry Thoroughly:** After cleaning, let the cover dry completely before putting it back on. Moisture trapped under the cover promotes mildew and mold growth, which degrades fabric and may cause unpleasant odors.
- **Use Protective Sprays:** Applying water-repellent or UV-protective sprays designed for outdoor fabrics can refresh protective coatings and extend the cover’s life. Check product instructions to ensure compatibility with your cover material.
- **Avoid Sharp Objects:** When handling the cover, be mindful of sharp edges from kitchen appliances or tools that could puncture or tear the fabric. Store the cover safely when not in use, folded neatly to avoid creases or damage.
- **Inspect and Repair:** Frequently inspect your cover for small holes, loose stitching, or worn areas. Prompt repairs prevent minor issues from turning into costly replacements.
 
### Seasonal Considerations for Protection

Weather changes impact your covered outdoor kitchen differently throughout the year. In winter, heavy snow or ice accumulation can weigh down poorly supported covers, so choosing a cover with a rigid or semi-rigid frame may be beneficial. During the summer months, intense sun exposure demands materials with high UV resistance to avoid fading and material breakdown.

For rainy or humid climates, prioritize water-resistant fabrics and ensure your cover allows for ventilation to reduce moisture buildup underneath. A well-ventilated cover decreases chances of rust forming on metal appliances and keeps the cooking area fresher.

### Custom Fit Covers for Maximum Protection

An essential step in choosing outdoor kitchen covers is ensuring a snug fit. Loose covers flap in the wind, causing wear and tear, while tight-fitting ones avoid dirt intrusion and hold up better to weather challenges. Taking precise measurements of your kitchen structure informs your decision, whether buying off-the-shelf or ordering custom-made covers.

Additionally, covers with adjustable straps, elastic hems, or drawstrings add security and prevent the cover from being accidentally blown away during storms. These features improve both the protection and longevity of your outdoor kitchen cover.

### Balancing Cost and Quality for a Smart Investment

While lower-cost covers may seem tempting, investing in high-quality, durable materials will save you time and money in the long run. Cheap fabrics can degrade quickly under sun and rain, forcing frequent replacements. A quality cover might have a higher upfront cost but provides better protection and requires less maintenance. This balance helps keep your outdoor kitchen looking great and fully functional for many seasons to come.

### Closing Thoughts on Making the Best Choice

Choosing the right material and maintaining your outdoor kitchen cover is key to enjoying a beautiful, functional cooking space outdoors. Focus on materials that suit your local climate and cooking habits, and maintain your cover with care to extend its usefulness. With good choices and simple upkeep, your covered outdoor kitchen structure will provide you with enjoyment and protection year-round.

</section>### Conclusion

Covered outdoor kitchen structures offer a perfect blend of functionality and style, transforming your backyard into an inviting space for cooking and entertaining. By providing shelter from sun and rain, these structures extend the usability of your outdoor kitchen throughout the year. Whether you prefer a sleek modern design or a rustic vibe, you can tailor your covered space to match your personal taste and complement your home’s exterior. Thoughtful design choices, like incorporating lighting and storage within the cover, enhance convenience and create a cozy atmosphere for gatherings.

Selecting the right materials for your outdoor kitchen cover is crucial to ensure longevity and ease of maintenance. Durable options such as cedar, aluminum, or vinyl resist harsh weather and require minimal upkeep, allowing you to enjoy your kitchen without constant worry about repairs. Regular care, including cleaning and treating wood surfaces, helps maintain the structure’s appearance and functionality for years to come. By investing in quality materials and following maintenance tips, your covered outdoor kitchen will remain a welcoming hub for family and friends, making every meal an experience to cherish. Embracing these practical and design-focused approaches elevates your outdoor living space, turning ordinary cooking into something truly special.

1k0e6gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k0e6gp/i31f_am_looking_forward_to_a_visit_with_a/,I(31f) am looking forward to a visit with a friend(31f) but concerned my husband's(33m) change of plans will impact mine. Should Ijust accept my plans may be canceled?,"A couple months ago, I made plans to visit my friend, Lori, who lives about 4 hrs from my city. We planned a weekend where I would stay at her rural home, adventure around her area in the day and then make meals and drink good wine together in the evenings. I've been really looking forward to it. 

I told my husband about it as soon as the plans were made. I said he was welcome to join but he didn't really jump at the invitiation. A week ago he mentioned that he probably wouldn't come to Lori's, but would drive with me. He has friends in a neighbouring town, so he would drop me off and continue on to them for a visit. Then he would pick me up at the end of the weekend to drive home together. I mentioned that was probably for the best, as Lori recently got a couple dogs and my husband is somewhat allergic. He doesn't have a reaction with every dog he meets, but I think the combination of two heavy shedders in a small house could be an issue. My husband didn't really acknowledge the comment, as his plans were already made anyway. 

Flash forward to today and my husband's plans have completely fallen through. He asked if he could join me at Lori's. I mentioned the dogs again and he said not to worry about it - he would load up on allergy pills and it will be fine. 

I feel hesitant about this. He's stayed in close quarters with multiple dogs before and he ended up pretty wheezy and uncomfortable. My concern is that he's going to have a reaction and then need to leave. Of course, I wouldn't want him to stay somewhere he's suffering, but the most logical choice would be to return home. Since we are driving home together, I would need to go with him. I've had this weekend planned with Lori for months and I feel like there's heavy potential it ends up derailed. On the other hand, my husband's allergies are not his fault and I don't want him to feel excluded, especially since he seems disappointed his own plans have evaporated. I feel like I'm being selfish by potentially not supporting a health issue he has no control over. 

I have to speak with him tomorrow about this. I'm curious what his expectation is, should he have a reaction to the dogs. My parents live in a neighbouring city 20 min from Lori, so I considered suggesting they be a back up place to stay if things get bad... However, I'm not necessarily volunteering to go with him. Lori and I have planned a bunch of activities together, some of which will have to canceled if I go with my husband to my parents place. I'll need to coordinate getting back out to her place each day, losing time. Plus, I wanted the freedom to stay up late, have morning coffee together, and enjoy a full weekend with a friend I don't see often. 

Am I being selfish with my want to retain my plans? Should Ijust accept they may end up canceled?

TL;DR: My husband has asked to piggyback on plans I've had with a friend for months because his own plans fell through. I'm fine with him coming, but his allergies could mean things have to be cut short. I'm wondering if me potentially keeping my plans despite this, is selfish.",2,1744786599.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

1k0e4l9,https://i.redd.it/zqsw146y85ve1.jpeg,Intermittent Fasting for Beginners: A Complete Guide to Lose Weight and Boost Energy,"**Learn how to start intermittent fasting, how it works, and how to make it sustainable for your lifestyle.**

In a world full of trendy diets, **intermittent fasting (IF)** stands out — not because it’s extreme, but because it’s **simple, flexible, and effective**. Whether you're trying to lose weight, reduce bloating, or just feel more energized throughout the day, IF might be the lifestyle shift you’ve been looking for.

In this beginner’s guide, you’ll learn **what intermittent fasting is, how it works, the different methods, and tips to get started safely.**

# 🕰️ What Is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting is not about **what** you eat, but **when** you eat. It’s an eating pattern that alternates between periods of eating and fasting.

Your body naturally fasts when you sleep — IF simply extends that fasting window to allow your body more time to rest, digest, and burn fat.

# 🔥 How Intermittent Fasting Helps with Weight Loss and Energy

When you fast, your insulin levels drop, which signals your body to **burn stored fat for energy**. At the same time, growth hormone increases, helping with **muscle repair and fat metabolism**.

People often report:

* Reduced belly fat
* More stable energy levels
* Less brain fog
* Reduced cravings

# ⏱️ Popular Intermittent Fasting Methods

Choose a method that fits your lifestyle:

# 1. 16/8 Method

Fast for 16 hours, eat within an 8-hour window (e.g., eat from 12 PM to 8 PM).

# 2. 14/10 Method

A gentler approach: eat within a 10-hour window, fast for 14.

# 3. 5:2 Method

Eat normally 5 days a week, and reduce calories to \~500–600 on the other 2 days.

# 4. Eat-Stop-Eat

Once or twice a week, fast for 24 hours (e.g., dinner to dinner). Best for advanced fasters.

# 🥗 What to Eat During Eating Windows

While you can technically eat anything during your window, you’ll see better results with **nutrient-rich foods** like:

* Lean proteins (chicken, tofu, fish)
* Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)
* Whole grains (brown rice, oats, quinoa)
* Lots of veggies and low-sugar fruits
* Hydrating fluids (water, herbal tea, black coffee)

# 🚫 What to Avoid

* Sugary snacks and drinks
* Refined carbs (white bread, pastries)
* Overeating just because the window is open

Remember: **IF is not a license to binge — it’s a mindful approach to eating.**

# 💡 Tips for Beginners

* Start slow with a 12/12 or 14/10 method
* Stay hydrated throughout the day
* Keep busy during fasting hours
* Expect some hunger at first — it gets easier!
* Break your fast gently (avoid heavy meals)
* Listen to your body — if you feel weak or dizzy, eat something

# ⚠️ Who Should Avoid IF?

Intermittent fasting isn’t for everyone. Avoid or consult a doctor first if you:

* Are pregnant or breastfeeding
* Have a history of eating disorders
* Are underweight
* Have diabetes or chronic conditions

# 🌟 Final Thoughts

Intermittent fasting is **a powerful yet flexible way** to improve your health, lose weight, and feel more energized. The best part? No complicated rules, no special foods, and no counting calories.

Just choose a method, stay consistent, and let your body do what it was designed to do — **heal, rest, and thrive**.",1,1744786367.0,u_Doctor_Dhanu,0,1.0,False

I always wake up not completely rested no matter how many hours i sleep, and in general i feel a bit ""foggy"" throughout the day (never falling asleep without knowing it, i just feel a layer of tiredness that envelops me).

Circa 2 years ago i had surgery done for a deviated septum, turbinate hypertrophy, and to drain my sinuses. This didn't help at all with my difficulty with breathing through my nose (also, when i saw my ent several months after the surgery, the turbinates were already beginning to swell). My nostrils aren't completely blocked, i'm able to breath with my nose through the day, but occasionally I use my mouth and in general find it hard to use my nose/feel resistance when getting air in. I tried using strips/etc. but it doesn't do much.

These past few weeks i tryed testing my sleep using the apple watch, and my deep sleep isn't very good. Anecdotally, i rarely remember dreams, generally wake up with a dry throat, and seem to get up at least once or twice to go to the bathroom (even if i consciously don't drink anything 3-4 h before going to bed). I train almost daily, eat fairly well, generally don't use my phone 30min/1h before going to bed (i read or just do nothing), don't drink much caffeine (one or two decaf instant coffees in the morning. But even when i went 2 months without consuming any form of caffeine, things didn't improve). So all in all i think i have ""decent"" sleep hygiene.

I live in italy so i could buy a cpap withouth needing a prescription. I found a used airsense 10 for 300 euros, and because taking a sleep study would cost me 150-200 euros, i though of trying the cpap for a couple of months (gathering data with oscar and asking for advice on how to optimize the settings using the various OSA communities that are online).

Age: 156

Height: 7'9""

Weight: 287 lbs.

Class: Ranger

Alignment: True Neutral

Personality: Do no Harm, but take no shit. Southern Madame accent. Very set in her ways. Personality very similar to a kind but also sassy southern grandma.

Backstory: Jezebel was born to the sea, getting her sealegs before she could use her actual legs. Her family came from a small no name fishing hamlet in the far corner of the world, making a living pearl diving and selling fish. That village was wiped out and gone before she could form her first coherent thought, and she was taken by the pirates who did it and sold to the highest bidder. She was one of the lucky ones, sold to be a bilge rat, servant aboard a merchant vessel. She lived her life up into her teens in the cargo hold of a galleon. One day that galleon too was beset by pirates. The crew was swiftly taken hostage and given the ultimatum, join or die, jezebel chose the latter. It wasnt long before she started to get used to the new freedom the pirate life gave her. sure it was hard, but at least she got to live life for herself instead of some foreign lord for the first time since she was a baby. During her time in this crew, she met lorenz, a debonair man, with skin the color of coffee and a tongue as sharp as a straight razor, but also the kindest and sweetest man she had ever met. The two became inseparable, fighting side by side in the pirate life, and side by side in marriage some decade later. But, as all things must, that too came to an end, with lorenz's life being tragically cut short by an outbreak of the pox on the ship. With lorenz gone, jezebel had lost the one solid piece of stone she had found in the stormy sea of life, and she had decided to end it, throwing herself into the tides. Fate had other plans for her, with her washing up on the shore of the very same village that she had been born to, almost as if some divine joke. She never recovered fully from the wound lorenz's death left her, but she was able to live on, a changed lonely woman. She stayed in that village, slowly rebuilding it from the ground up, under a new life, and a new name, where her past transgressions in that pirate crew couldn't follow her. Some decades later, the people around her grew old and passed, everyone she had ever known dead before she even reached middle age, but so to did the memories of her former life, seeming more like a bad dream now. Now known as the sad hermit fish woman to the locals, over a hundred years since her time as a pirate, the seas begin to call again, as unknown powers begin to churn the waters and turn the winds for their own designs, Jezebel unknowingly is getting pulled once again to the life of the sea, and the world of pirates, for fame, glory, and the fate of the seas.",5,1744786131.0,characterdrawing,0,0.86,False

1k0dwwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1k0dwwq/milk_clarified_bella_donna_daiquiri/,Milk Clarified Bella Donna Daiquiri,"I had a bunch of left over Amaretto from a party and decided to try my hand at making a Bella Donna to use some of the excess up. Previous posts on this sub noted that this cocktail has a ""cough syrup-y"" flavor, so I figured I would experiment with milk clarification to see if I could mitigate the cough syrup taste. There has been some disagreement in previous posts on what the best ratios are for the Bella Donna. Some suggested avoiding the Difford's recipe, while others have recommended using standard Daiquiri ratios (by subbing the lime for lemon and simple syrup for amaretto). I ultimately ended up using the following:

1 Part Dark Rum

1 Part Freshly Squeezed Lemon Juice

1 Part Amaretto

I also added a little hint of agave syrup as well for a bit more sweetness as a matter of personal preference...but the amaretto suffices on its own to be honest.

I mixed all the ingredients together in a large mixing glass and had a little taste before clarifying — it did indeed have a slight cough syrup-y note to it (as previous posts described). So I proceeded to the clarifying phase to see if clarification made any significant difference. I used to think clarifying was a crazy advanced technique, but it's actually super easy. I poured 16 oz of my unclarified cocktail mixture over 6 oz of milk in a large pitcher (I've seen a whole range of recommendations for ratio of cocktail to milk, but this 8:3 ratio has worked well for me in the past). Then I left the cocktail/milky mixture alone for about 30 minutes, giving enough time for those casein proteins in the milk to mop up the polyphenols and tannins in the cocktail. Then I filtered out the milk curds using coffee filter paper + one of those metal cone filters ([link to the filter I got from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KQVW6RR?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_17&amp=&crid=2EB05VI3AGFXF&sprefix=coffee%2Bfilter%2Bpot&th=1)). The original mixture was a very deep, dark brown color. But after clarification, it came out this beautiful light amber color.

Now came the moment of truth. I served the clarified Bella Donna with some nice clear ice and gave it a few sips. Had clarification effectively mitigated the cough syrup-y notes? In a word, yes! The finished product was much more pleasant tasting. Not too tart, not overly sweet, and far less abrasive than the unfiltered version. It's not my favorite drink in the world, but the clarified version of the Bella Donna still made for an enjoyable sipping experience.

If someone in the future wants to try their hand at the Bella Donna Daiquiri and stumbles across this post, I would highly recommend clarification. The unclarified version is not bad by any means, and I would've been perfectly content drinking the original cocktail. But the milk clarification does make it noticeably better.",1,1744785444.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

As I understand it, the dilemma is that when a country’s currency is the global reserve (like the U.S. dollar), it needs to run trade deficits to “export” dollars and keep the global economy liquid. But the downside is that this can hurt the domestic economy over time by weakening local manufacturing and making the country more reliant on imports.

Is that basically right? And what are the main counterpoints or critiques of this view?

* Someone in or near **Houston** willing to **meet in person** or work **side-by-side (like at a coffee shop, etc.)**
* Help me **edit a VRChat avatar** in Unity to add a few toggles/props:
   * A **whiskey glass** that the character can hold (animated toggle) with simulated liquid if possible
   * A **smoking skull pipe** prop (can be a simple hold or smoke animation)
   * Ideally show me how to upload it and prep it for VRChat so I can handle it solo in the future
* If possible, a quick primer on **working with avatars in Unity**, so I can continue improving the rest of the cast on my own

# Budget:

* My ideal offer is **$100** for your time, though this may be extended if needed
* Ideally looking for someone cool with a couple hours of work and who’s down to help a creator get started learning.

I’m **not looking for someone to do it all for me** — I genuinely want to learn from the process, and I’d prefer a hands-on walkthrough rather than just a file drop. even if this means i just sit and observe while you get the work done.

Well, after months wrestling with scribbled notes, surviving way too many late nights, and drinking frankly alarming amounts of campfire-strength coffee, I'm finally doing the thing! I'm launching my debut serial, **""The Hunger Within,""** right here on Royal Road.

If you're like me and enjoy your fantasy on the darker side, with monsters that are genuinely unsettling and protagonists who are walking a tightrope between saving the day and becoming the nightmare... then this might be right up your alley.

**So, what's it about?**

They call her the **Lone Hunter.** Saria operates in the shadows, taking the jobs no one else dares touch. She's the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out her squad. Her secret weapon? The Hunger—an alien symbiote that saved her life but now demands a horrific price to keep them both going.

To feed it (and stay alive), Saria has to hunt increasingly dangerous things. But The Hunger isn't just raw power; it whispers. Forgotten instincts, ancient memories, glimpses of something far older and deeper than simple darkness. Haunted by her past and literally bonded to a monster, Saria's fighting a war on two fronts: against the beasts stalking the world, and the abyss threatening to swallow her from within.

**What kind of ride are you in for?**

* A gritty, lived-in world brimming with nasty monsters, strange magic, and unfolding mysteries.
* A lone hunter powered by a symbiote – but she's on a dangerous clock.
* Plenty of moral grey areas, slow-burn lore reveals, and choices with real teeth.
* Monster hunting, shadow wars, and a deep dive into the struggle against an ancient, internal power.
* Chapters dropping **every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.**

If you're a fan of stories like **The Witcher**, **Claymore**, or just **dark progression fantasy with some bite**, I think you might dig this one.

Thanks for reading this far! Always happy to chat craft, worldbuilding, or anything else with fellow authors, readers, or lore nerds.

The next day I went to Target and ran into her in the checkout line. She recognized me, said hi and we briefly talked about the guy and what I do (since ik what she does lol) and our names. We didn’t get to talk long tho and I didn’t get her number. I was thinking about going to the same coffee shop tomorrow (a week from my other date) to talk to her more. Maybe even get her number or ask her out. But I don’t want to be too forward especially since she’ll be likely working. Any tips?

I am doing a pool party in a couple weeks and was thinking about asking for her number/inviting her to that too if that’s a good idea too.",1,1744784715.0,Advice,5,0.67,False

As threat actors grow more persistent and sophisticated, organizations need to anticipate attacks—not just respond to them.

That’s where Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) steps in. And more recently, CTI automation has become a game-changer. Think fewer repetitive tasks, faster detection, and decisions based on actual context—not guesswork.

So, Why Automate CTI in the First Place?

Manual CTI workflows are draining. Imagine combing through logs, feeds, and alerts every single day to find the *one* thing that matters. Now multiply that by ten if you’re handling multiple clients or complex environments.

With automation in the picture:

* Threats get flagged quicker
* Analysts aren’t bogged down with redundant tasks
* You gain consistent, reliable intelligence—across the board

Techniques That Actually Work in the Field

1. Automated Threat Feed Ingestion

You can't defend what you don't see. Most orgs pull intel from sources like OSINT, commercial feeds, and sharing groups like ISACs. But these come in different formats, which makes correlation a pain.

Automation solves that. With the help of platforms like *MISP* or *OpenCTI*, threat feeds are normalized into a readable, unified format.

2. IOC Correlation at Scale

Indicators of Compromise (IP addresses, hashes, domains, etc.) only help if they’re mapped against your own environment. Automating this correlation lets you spot malicious activity before it becomes a headline.

Pairing this with tools like *TheHive + Cortex* or *Splunk* means you can jump from detection to action in minutes, not hours.

3. Prioritization Based on Context

Every alert is not a crisis—and automation can help tell the difference. CTI tools can assign risk scores based on severity, frequency, and known associations. Many teams map this to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which adds context that’s often missing in raw alerts.

4. Text Analysis Using NLP

This one’s underrated: scraping blogs, threat reports, or dark web forums for mentions of new CVEs or malware strains. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can extract that info and feed it straight into your detection logic.

It’s like having someone monitoring hacker chatter 24/7—without needing coffee breaks.

5. SOAR-Based Playbooks

This is where it all comes together. SOAR tools like *Cortex XSOAR* or *Splunk Phantom* let you build playbooks that respond automatically to threats:

* Block IPs in firewalls
* Isolate compromised devices
* Pull related logs for analysis

When done right, you’ve got response times in seconds—not hours.

6. ML-Based Threat Detection

Machine learning can identify behavioral patterns that fall outside the norm. It’s especially helpful for spotting stealthy threats that don’t match known IOCs.

But It’s Not All Smooth Sailing

Let’s be real—CTI automation isn’t plug-and-play.

* False positives can still sneak through if rules aren’t fine-tuned.
* Too many feeds? Without filtering, it’s just noise.
* And not all tools “talk” to each other, which means you’re back to stitching dashboards.

Also: no matter how automated your pipeline is, human review is still crucial. Automation gives you speed. Humans bring insight.

What’s Next?

CTI automation isn’t about adding more tools. It’s about making better use of the ones you already have.

The sweet spot lies in:

* Streamlining the flow from intel → detection → response
* Aligning CTI with your actual risk profile
* And building workflows your analysts will actually use

If your current setup still feels manual and reactive, it might be time to rethink your CTI strategy!",1,1744784563.0,cybersecurityexams,0,1.0,False

About the pineapple on pizza discussion. Just hear me out okay?

Pineapple on pizza is like that one quirky friend you didn't ask for it, but now the party's better because they're there. Plus, it’s fruit, so technically, it makes pizza a salad. You're welcome.....😌🤣

Closing Argument:
If you’re looking for a partner-in-crime who will take you on wild motorcycle rides, crush you at Mario Kart, and debate pizza toppings with unshakable confidence, slide into my DMs. If not, may your coffee be hot, your Wi-Fi fast, and your day lovely. 😊🍷👋🏽
